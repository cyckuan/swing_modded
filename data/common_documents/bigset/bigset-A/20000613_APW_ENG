<HEADLINE> Fourth poll finds Clinton-Lazio race tight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A fourth statewide poll in less than three
weeks has found Hillary Rodham Clinton in a very close Senate race
with Republican Rep. Rick Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   A CBS News/New York Times poll released Monday had Clinton with
a slight lead over the congressman from Long Island. The first lady
was backed by 44 percent of likely voters surveyed to 39 percent
for Lazio. Seventeen percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   A CBS News/New York Times poll out in April had Clinton leading
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, 49 percent to 41 percent, with 10 percent
undecided. Giuliani quit the race May 19 to deal with his prostate
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that in many ways the Senate race has become a
whole new contest with Lazio replacing Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Not only have the number of undecided voters increased, but
while Clinton and Giuliani were running even in traditionally more
conservative upstate New York in April, the new poll had Lazio
leading in that region, 46 percent to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And in the category of who would be better at working with other
senators, Clinton's edge has largely evaporated. In April, Clinton
led Giuliani, 57 percent to 30 percent, on that front. In the new
poll, 42 percent said Clinton would work better with other senators
while 38 percent said that about Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   While 30 percent of voters said Lazio was spending more time
attacking Clinton than talking about issues, 52 percent said that
was the case with Giuliani back in April.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that hasn't changed is that many New Yorkers would
prefer to have a senator who was born in the state. Almost four in
10 voters in the new poll felt that way.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has been stressing the carpetbagger issue, presenting
himself as the ''Made in New York'' candidate. Until January,
Clinton has never lived in the state.
</P>
<P>
   But the poll also found that many voters really don't know much
about the new Republican candidate. Forty-seven percent said they
didn't know enough about Lazio to even decide if their impression
of him was favorable or unfavorable. Twenty-six percent said they
had a favorable opinion of him while 10 percent said they had an
unfavorable opinion of the congressman.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll of 1,187 likely voters was conducted from
June 4 through Saturday and had a margin of error of three
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Since Lazio joined the race, polls have either shown Clinton
with a small lead or the two candidates essentially tied.

<HEADLINE> Syrians Show Support for Bashar  </HEADLINE>
By HAMZA HENDAWI
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Amid a frenzied national outpouring of
grief, Syria's leadership lined up behind late President Hafez
Assad's son as the choice to succeed him, with the parliament
speaker on Monday declaring Bashar Assad as capable as his father.
</P>
<P>
   But in an almost Shakespearean twist, a new threat emerged from
within the Assad family. Rifaat Assad, younger brother of the late
president who has been in exile in Europe since attempting to seize
power in 1983, made his own claim to the presidency just one day
before Hafez Assad was to be buried.
</P>
<P>
   In the first open challenge to what has otherwise been a smooth
transition, Rifaat Assad promised a ''corrective movement'' in
Syria -- a term used to refer to Hafez Assad's coup in 1970. The
statement to the Syrian people was read Monday night by an
announcer on Arab News Network, a London-based satellite television
station owned by Rifaat's son Sawmar.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, Rifaat said through a spokesman that he planned
to return to Damascus at the ''appropriate time'' to contest his
nephew's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ''He (Rifaat) represents legitimacy in Syria,'' Rifaat Assad's
spokesman Al-Hareth Al-Khair said, adding that ''the people and the
army ... are with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Khair appeared to be exaggerating the extent of Rifaat's
following in Syria. He enjoyed considerable popularity at the time
of his work alongside his elder brother, but his long years in
exile and the removal of his supporters in the army and the ruling
Baath party renders him a spent political force.
</P>
<P>
   The army has already publicly pledged its backing for Bashar
Assad.
</P>
<P>
   Though Syria adopted a republican system after independence from
France in 1946, the hereditary succession and familial challenge to
the presidency was reminiscent of Shakespeare's dramas about
European royalty. But the speaker of the People's Assembly,
Abdul-Qader Qadoura, also a member of the party's national
leadership, brushed aside talk of a ''royal republic,'' saying
Syria was governed by ''institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   In the streets of Syria, the people declared their support for
the late president's son, chanting his name and waving his portrait
alongside those of his father in mourning marches that erupted in
cities and towns throughout this country of 17 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Readings of verses from the Koran, Islam's holy book, echoed
from mosque speakers throughout the night. In the early hours
Tuesday some Syrians, dressed in black, walked silently along the
route the funeral cortege would take later in the day when Hafez
Assad's body was to be taken from Damascus to his hometown of
Qardaha, 200 miles north.
</P>
<P>
   With shops closed in a show of respect, street hawkers did a
brisk business selling portraits of Assad, Bashar and his elder
brother Basil, Assad's first choice for a successor who died in a
road accident in 1994. Black cloth was also sold by the yard to
hang on buildings and fly from car antennas.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of banners and poster-size portraits of
Assad and his two sons were plastered on buildings, cars,
motorcycles and even the bare chests of male Syrians taking part in
the mourning marches, most of which were accompanied by drummers. A
few mourners even cut themselves to express their sorrow, in
keeping with Shiite Muslim tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The frenzy of mourning, though officially orchestrated like all
other mass displays in Syria, carried an element of genuine grief.
Assad was the only leader many Syrians had ever known, and despite
-- or perhaps because of -- his iron-fisted rule, he instilled in
ordinary Syrians a sense of security and national pride.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of such an outpouring, Rifaat Assad's spokesman
Al-Khair stressed that the challenger will work through peaceful
means. Rifaat, he said, ''stresses peaceful action and refraining
from spilling blood and does not want Syria to drown in blood. But
he believes that legitimacy will prevail in a rightful way.''
</P>
<P>
   Rifaat Assad, 63, who has a political science doctorate from the
former Soviet Union -- his thesis was on class struggle in Syria --
was once vice president to his brother.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad has in the three days since his father's death
received the crucial support of the armed forces' top brass, been
promoted from colonel to general and been nominated to the office
of president by the leadership of the Baath party. It was the
tribute his father, who had groomed him for succession, might have
wanted more than any other.
</P>
<P>
   Qadoura heaped lavish praise for Bashar Assad's abilities
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mission of defending and loving the nation is not linked
to a man's age,'' he told a news conference. ''We believe that
every citizen in Syria who is capable of giving should be allowed
to give regardless of his age.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The challenges are the same, the people are the same and the
baton has been handed over to someone who came from this party and
this people. Therefore he is capable of dealing with the
challenges,'' said Qadoura.
</P>
<P>
   As Syrians took to the streets for the third straight day
chanting ''Assad is in heaven!'' and ''Bashar, Bashar, we sacrifice
our blood and lives for you!'' world leaders and dignitaries began
to assemble in the capital, Damascus, for Tuesday's funeral. Late
into the evening, state television showed them arriving at the
Damascus airport.
</P>
<P>
   Among the first to arrive were Sudanese President Omar El Bashir
and former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Most
dignitaries, including French President Jacques Chirac, U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook, were due to fly in early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The United States listed Assad's Syria as a sponsor of
terrorism, criticized its human rights record and grew frustrated
at delays in the Israeli-Syrian peace talks it tried to mediate.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, as she prepared to head to Syria, Albright said: ''I
think that it's totally appropriate that we pay our respects to a
historic figure and that we express our condolences to the people
of Syria.''

Court Nixes Some Lawsuits Vs. HMOs

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court shut down one legal avenue for people to
sue their health-maintenance organizations Monday. The justices' unanimous
ruling said patients cannot use a federal law to sue HMOs for giving doctors a
financial incentive to cut treatment costs. Such lawsuits could mean the end of
HMOs, which are based on financial incentives, the court said. In another
ruling, the Supreme Court made it easier for employees to prove they were
victims of on-the-job discrimination, or at least get their accusations to a
jury, without direct evidence of intentional bias.

Los Alamos Nuclear Secrets Missing

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two computer hard drives containing an array of nuclear

June 1 and have not ruled out the possibility that the disappearance is related
to the forest fire that threatened the lab and forced its evacuation last month.
Senior officials expressed doubt that it involved espionage.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Nixon's estate will receive an $18 million
compensation payment from the Justice Department for thousands of secretly

government said Nixon's estate at one point had sought $35 million plus 25 years
worth of interest, bringing the asking price to more than $200 million. The $18
million figure was reached in a settlement in U.S. District Court in Washington
over the value of items seized when Nixon resigned rather than face impeachment.

Columbine Tapes Reveal Chaos
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Videotapes from surveillance cameras show students
huddling under tables in the Columbine High School cafeteria and then two gunmen
casually walking through the room after nearly everyone had fled. The tapes give
some glimpses of the chaos that erupted when students Eric Harris and Dylan
Klebold began an assault April 20, 1999, that left 12 students and a teacher
dead. The pair then killed themselves. The Jefferson County sheriff's office
made the tapes public last week after a judge ruled in favor of victims'
families who sought them under the state open-records law. The two tapes are
from four surveillance cameras in the cafeteria, which is downstairs from the
main killing field in the library.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton met with Indonesia's
president Abdurrahman Wahid during a short visit Monday to discuss
the country's troubles.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Mike Hammer said Clinton went over Wahid's
economic and military reform programs, as well as the nation's
political situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president encouraged him to strengthen Indonesia's
democracy,'' Hammer said, adding that they ''no doubt'' discussed
the East Timor situation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, was also
present at the half-hour meeting. Wahid is in the United States
primarily for medical reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia is dealing with a myriad of crises, including reported
human rights abuses by the military, a crippled economy and, most
recently, a major earthquake and resulting aftershocks in Sumatra
that killed over 100, injured 1,900 and left many more homeless.
</P>
<P>
   After three decades of authoritarian rule, Indonesia is facing
repeated challenges to national unity.
</P>
<P>
   Two regions wishing independence erupted into violence after
Jakarta refused, and just last week Wahid's government turned down
another area looking for autonomy. East Timor is currently being
run by the United Nations as it prepares for independence.

<HEADLINE> NY Cheers Springsteen's Diallo Song  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- To loud cheers and scattered boos, Bruce
Springsteen sang about the New York City killing of Amadou Diallo
during the musician's opening night of a 10-show stand at Madison
Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Bandmembers approached microphones one by one Monday and
repeated the words ''41 shots,'' referring to the number of times
four white officers shot at Diallo, a black West African immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   One heckler was escorted from the Garden after he approached the
stage and flashed obscene hand gestures at Springsteen during the
song.
</P>
<P>
   A police union had urged its members to stay away from the
concert in protest of the new song, ''American Skin (41 Shots).''
</P>
<P>
   Diallo, 22, was fatally wounded as he stood in the vestibule of
his Bronx home on Feb. 4, 1999. He was struck by 19 bullets. The
four officers were acquitted of murder earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The song, the seventh of the show, did not mention Diallo's
name, and Springsteen said nothing about it before or after he
sang.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is this your wallet? Is this your life?'' he sang, referring
to Diallo's wallet, which police mistook for a gun.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, he sang ''You can get killed just for living
in your American skin.''
</P>
<P>
   A family friend said Diallo's parents planned to attend the
concert to thank Springsteen for the song. Their presence could not
be immediately confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Spokespeople for Springsteen did not return repeated telephone
messages for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen introduced ''American Skin'' last week during a
concert in Atlanta with his E Street Band. The song is unrecorded
and unreleased.
</P>
<P>
   The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, which represents the
city's 27,000 police officers, has urged its members not to attend
or work overtime security detail at Springsteen's Garden concerts.

<HEADLINE> US: Asbestos-Like Fibers in Crayons  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government tests of crayons have found that
while most contain asbestos-like fibers, they pose little risk to
the health of children, federal regulators said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to government requests, the nation's top three crayon
manufacturers have agreed to reformulate their crayons to remove
the fibers.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission tested 25 crayons made by
major manufacturers and found three contained amounts of asbestos
too small to be scientifically significant, spokesman Russ Rader
said. However, 21 of the crayons contained larger amounts of
''transitional fiber,'' which is similar to asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   Rader said because the fibers are imbedded in wax the chance of
a child being exposed is extremely small, but as a precaution they
had asked crayon manufacturers to reformulate their products.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where children are concerned you have to be extra cautious,''
said CPSC Chairwoman Ann Brown. ''The risk is low, but the concerns
with these fibers should not be ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   Dixon Ticonderoga, which makes Prang crayons, and Rose Art have
agreed to use new formulas within a year, Rader said.
</P>
<P>
   Binney and Smith, makers of Crayola crayons, also said they
would follow the agency's recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect that we'll be able to begin producing reformulated
crayons that are equally safe, with the same quality,'' said Mark
Schwab, the company's president.
</P>
<P>
   Binney and Smith has said testing by an independent
government-certified lab found no asbestos in Crayola crayons.
</P>
<P>
   The safety commission researchers found trace amounts of
asbestos in two Crayola crayons and in one Prang crayon. But of the
25 tested, only two Crayola and two Rose Art crayons contained none
of the transitional fibers.
</P>
<P>
   There are no known reports of anyone getting sick from using or
making crayons. And asbestos-related illness tends to result from
exposure to airborne fibers -- usually in an industrial setting.
</P>
<P>
   The agency researchers simulated a child using crayons for half
an hour and found no fibers in the air. They also concluded that
even if a child ate a crayon, there would be a low risk of exposure
because the fibers are imbedded in wax.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to allay parents' concerns and teachers' concerns.
They can continue to allow children to use crayons without worry,''
Rader said. ''They crayons are not harmful.''
</P>
<P>
   The asbestos and similar fibers in crayons are found in talc,
which is used to keep crayons from breaking. The fibers exist
naturally in the environment and become mixed in with the talc when
that mineral is mined.
</P>
<P>
   Rader said that even though the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention has recommended that the transitional fibers be listed
as a potential cancer-causing material along with asbestos, the
safety commission decided there was no scientific basis for a
crayon recall.

<HEADLINE> Bus Overturns On Interstate; 1 Dead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENFIELD, Ind. (AP) -- A sport-utility vehicle crossed a
highway median Monday and collided with a Greyhound bus, flipping
the bus onto its side. One person was killed and more than 40
others were injured.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw the SUV coming across the median. The bus driver tried
to veer to the right to get out of the way,' said Todd Turpin, who
was driving behind the bus. ''But there was nothing he could do.''
</P>
<P>
   The accident, about 25 miles east of Indianapolis, happened
during afternoon rush-hour traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the sport-utility vehicle was killed, said Hancock
County Sheriff Nick Gulling. She was identified as Amy
McKee-Everett, 31, of rural Greenfield.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Clarke Mercer said all 45 passengers were injured,
along with the bus' driver, Julian Stenger of Indianapolis. Two
people were in fair condition, but none of the injuries appeared
life threatening.
</P>
<P>
   The bus was headed from New York to Los Angeles and had most
recently stopped in Dayton, Ohio, Greyhound spokeswoman Kristin
Parsley said. It was scheduled to stop in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Police closed both lanes of the highway near the crash.
Passengers sat in a field as rescue workers tended to the injured
near the bus.
</P>
<P>
   Truck driver Rick Tucker, 39, of Whitley City, Ky., said he saw
the accident and he described passengers jumping out the windows of
the wrecked bus. Someone brought a ladder to the scene so others
could leave the bus through an escape hatch on the roof.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just thankful it didn't kill any of them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1914, Greyhound Lines Inc. is the only national bus
line in the United States, serving 2,600 destinations.

<HEADLINE> Kan. Indian Activist Denied Parole  </HEADLINE>
By AMY SHAFER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEAVENWORTH, Kan. (AP) -- Leonard Peltier, the American Indian
serving two life sentences for the fatal shootings of two FBI
agents, was denied parole by a court officer after a hearing
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The parole examiner recommended that Peltier's sentence be
continued until his next full parole hearing in 2008. The U.S.
Parole Commission will review the recommendation and make a final
decision.
</P>
<P>
   One of Peltier's attorneys, Carl Nadler, said at a news
conference that the decision would be appealed.
</P>
<P>
   On June 26, 1975, FBI agents Ronald A. Williams and Jack R.
Coler pursued a robbery suspect into the Pine Ridge Indian
Reservation in South Dakota. A shootout erupted with activists from
the American Indian Movement, and the agents were first wounded,
then shot in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Two suspects were acquitted and a third freed for lack of
evidence. Peltier, after fleeing to Canada and being extradited to
the United States, was convicted and sentenced to consecutive life
terms in 1977, despite defense claims that evidence against him had
been falsified.
</P>
<P>
   Peltier, 55, has suffered from health problems in recent years,
including lockjaw, borderline diabetes and a series of small
strokes. He also is said to be nearly blind in one eye.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is being denied parole because he will not admit he shot
the agents in the way the FBI says he did,'' said one of his
attorneys, Jennifer Harbury. ''He is being forced to admit to a
crime he did not commit.''
</P>
<P>
   Peltier, considered by many supporters to be a political
prisoner, has drawn attention from domestic and international human
rights activists.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark said releasing Peltier
would be a step toward reconciliation between the government and
American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Also supporting Peltier at the news conference were
representatives of Amnesty International, the National Council of
Churches and the Assembly of First Nations in Canada.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor: Simpson Trial Damaging  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Six years after the killings of Nicole Brown
Simpson and Ronald Goldman set off the nation's most watched legal
drama, a prosecutor said he believes O.J. Simpson would have been
better off if his trial hadn't been televised.
</P>
<P>
   Former Deputy District Attorney Christopher Darden, appearing on
CNN's ''Larry King Live'' with his trial opponent Johnnie Cochran
Jr., said Monday he believes that without TV ''people in this
country would have accepted the verdict.''
</P>
<P>
   The public's opportunity to view the trial from beginning to end
bred skepticism and disagreement when Simpson was acquitted of
killing his ex-wife and her friend, Darden said. A jury in a civil
case later found Simpson liable for the deaths and ordered him to
pay a $33.5 million judgment.
</P>
<P>
   But Cochran said the televised trial presented a civics lesson
for the public.
</P>
<P>
   ''People now understand the roles of the parties and the role of
the judge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a non-confrontational joint appearance, both men said they
held no grudges toward one another or Superior Court Judge Lance
Ito, who they agreed tried to run the trial fairly.
</P>
<P>
   Darden said he holds no ill will for anyone except former police
Det. Mark Fuhrman, who lied on the witness stand when he said he
had not used a racial epithet to describe black people in 10 years.
After a tape recording of him using the word was produced to
discredit him, Fuhrman pleaded no contest to perjury, was fined
$200 and sentenced to probation.
</P>
<P>
   Darden said he never believed Fuhrman planted a bloody glove at
Simpson's home to try to frame him for the killings, as defense
attorneys charged.
</P>
<P>
   ''But when you get a cop up there on the witness stand and he
lies it undermines the whole case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the broadcast, a film clip showed Nicole Brown Simpson's
family visiting her grave to mark the anniversary of her death on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, a judge refused to order the release of
telephone records to a new Simpson lawyer. Attorney Douglas McCann
says the records, of a conversation between Ms. Simpson and her
mother on the night of the killings, will prove that Simpson had
already left on a business trip when the killings occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The Brown family has refused to relinquish the records and, at a
hearing Monday, Deputy District Attorney William Hodgman said the
defense had an opportunity to examine them during Simpson's trial.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Larry P. Fidler said he saw no basis for
releasing the records. A similar request has already been rejected
by a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, in an appearance in Des Moines, Iowa in connection
with a wrongful death suit there, Cochran said he thought Simpson
should abandon plans to take a lie-detector test about the
killings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody's views have been so set on this case. If he passes
the lie-detector test with flying colors, and it was administered
by people who he went out and selected, it's not going to change
anything at this point,'' Cochran said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney F. Lee Bailey said last week that Simpson would
take a lie detector test if someone put up a $3 million reward to
catch the killer.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson later told the Fox News Channel that he plans to answer
questions from the public through the Internet on
publiccrossing.com, with some of the proceeds going to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran said Simpson would have nothing to gain by taking the
test.
</P>
<P>
   ''People feel so strongly about this one way or the other,''
Cochran said. ''That would be my advice to him: It's not going to
make any difference. He should try to go on with his life and keep
raising those children.''

<HEADLINE> US Becomes Issue in Mexico Election  </HEADLINE>
By MARK STEVENSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The United States: a bully or an ally? A
partner or a threat? Mexicans' conflicting feelings about their
northern neighbor have become an issue in the country's July 2
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   As allegations mount that the United States mistreats Mexican
immigrants, President Ernesto Zedillo's ruling party -- which took
credit for improving U.S. relations of late -- is trying to exploit
anti-U.S. feelings in the electorate. The party is attacking the
leading opposition candidate for being too close to the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many Mexicans who go to the United States ... are hunted by
racists as if they were animals,'' says a television commercial by
the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. The ad
accuses opposition candidate Vicente Fox of failing to criticize
U.S. immigration policies.
</P>
<P>
   The race pits Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive and advocate of
free trade, against PRI candidate Francisco Labastida, who has
hinted at a return to a more state-supported economy. PRI campaign
ads accuse Fox, who is also a former governor, of prodding people
from his state to seek work as gardeners in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Fox could answer that there are 18 million Mexicans in
the United States because of the PRI's mismanagement of the
country,'' said political scientist Federico Estevez of Mexico
City's Autonomous Technical Institute, a major private university.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida, meanwhile, has been criticized for proposing
universal classes in computing and English in schools -- though the
latter might benefit his supporters, who recently published a
newspaper ad with the quasi-English headline: ''Fox is Chicken
Out.''
</P>
<P>
   Both leading candidates have pledged to fight drug smuggling.
Both say illegal immigration can be solved only in the long term by
increasing incomes and job opportunities in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   While Labastida would probably maintain the status quo in
bilateral relations, Fox wants to make ties even closer -- perhaps
too close for comfort for some in Mexico City and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''My proposal is for us to open the border to free transit in
five or 10 years, and create a common market in 20 years,'' Fox
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've presented the idea in Washington, and at first I think it
surprised them,'' he said. ''But I think they understood.''
</P>
<P>
   It's partly because of the nationalist sensitivity involved that
the U.S. government has maintained a studied neutrality on Mexico's
election. But that doesn't mean Washington policy-makers don't
care: Political stability in Mexico is key to U.S. security.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have said both Labastida -- who would be the first
Mexican president in 18 years who didn't attend a U.S. university --
and Fox are acceptable. And Estevez said the Mexican government is
stable and there is little chance of violence no matter who wins.
</P>
<P>
   But a razor-thin win by Labastida could create charges of fraud
and months of post-electoral protests. Fox has hinted at such a
scenario, saying: ''If someone from the regime decides to repress
our peaceful revolution, it is he who will cause the turbulence.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the slightest chance of instability worries both Washington
and Wall Street: Mexico is now one of the United States' chief
trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   The North American Free Trade Agreement, implemented in 1994,
cemented the two countries' ties. Officials now consult regularly
on almost every issue from trade to law enforcement to reduce the
surprises and spats that have sometimes poisoned relations.
</P>
<P>
   And an economic downturn in the United States could devastate
Mexico's economy -- increasing pressures on Mexicans to migrate
north.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States cannot stand by, unconcerned about problems
that affect Mexico,'' Mexico City-based analyst Jorge Chabat said.

<HEADLINE> Hare Krishna Organization Sued  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN PARROTT
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- More than three dozen former students of Hare
Krishna boarding schools filed a $400 million lawsuit against
leaders of the religious community Monday, alleging years of
sexual, physical and emotional torture.
</P>
<P>
   The 44 plaintiffs in the suit allege child abuse over two
decades at boarding schools in the United States and India.
</P>
<P>
   The federal lawsuit names the International Society of Krishna
Consciousness (ISKCON) as lead defendant, along with 17 members of
the group's governing board of top leaders and the estate of the
movement's founder, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' attorney Windle Turley called the abuse ''the most
unthinkable abuse and maltreatment of little children we have seen.
It includes rape, sexual abuse, physical torture and emotional
terror of children as young as 3 years of age.''
</P>
<P>
   He said ISKCON knowingly allowed suspected sex offenders to work
in its boarding schools.
</P>
<P>
   A Hare Krishna spokesman in Washington, Anuttama, said Monday
that Krishna leaders have acknowledged abuse in the boarding
schools and worked to provide counseling and financial support to
victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's disappointing that it had to go to a court situation,''
he said. ''We will try to do anything we can to address their
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   ISKCON's Child Protection Task Force, formed in 1998, has
compiled the names of 200 people who allegedly inflicted abuse in
the 1970s and '80s, said director Dhira Govinda. The office has
finished investigating more than 60 cases, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no doubt many children did suffer ... while under the
care of the organization,'' Govinda said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Krishna leaders have pledged $250,000 a year to
investigate past child abuse and aid survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Turley said the abuse started in 1972 at ISKCON's first school
in Dallas, and continued in six other U.S. schools and two in
India.
</P>
<P>
   He said he believes more than half of the children in the
schools were victimized.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the facts as they are developed will reveal more
than 1,000 child victims, many of whom have already taken their own
lives or are today emotionally and socially dysfunctional,'' said
Turley, whose Dallas law firm won millions in a sex abuse case
against the Roman Catholic Church in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement faxed to The Associated Press late Monday, Vinod
Patel, president of the Dallas Krishna Temple, said the temple is a
''different corporation with different by-laws, management and
staff from the organization that ran the school during the 1970s.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Not a single person involved with this temple since 1980 had
anything to do with the Krishna boarding school named in the
lawsuit,'' Patel said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the allegations against ISKCON are that young girls were
given as brides to older men who donated to the religious
community.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also claims that children were:
</P>
<P>
   --Forced to sleep in unheated rooms and walk great distances in
bitter cold without coats or shoes;
</P>
<P>
   --Deprived of medical care for malaria, hepatitis and broken
bones;
</P>
<P>
   --Scrubbed with steel wool until their skin bled;
</P>
<P>
   --Moved to different schools in different states without their
parents' consent.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiff Greg Luczyk, 30, said he was beaten four or five times
a day with a two-by-four while in a Krishna school in India in the
early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   He said his mother tried to remove him from the school and sent
him plane tickets to come home, but teachers would tear up the
tickets in front of school assemblies.
</P>
<P>
   ''The parents were trying to get us out, but the ring of
molesters had tight control,'' said Luczyk, who lives in Vancouver,
British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The Hare Krishna spiritual community flowered in the 1960s when
Prabhupada brought his distinctive form of devotional Hinduism to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, thousands of Westerners were wearing saris and pajama-like
dhotis, living in Hare Krishna temple compounds, and chanting the
mantra they believed would lead to a greater awareness of God known
as Krishna.
</P>
<P>
   Prabhupada said children should be sent to boarding schools at
age 5 so they could learn to be pure devotees, freeing parents to
sell devotional books and do other jobs.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the 1970s, 11 schools, known as gurukulas or
houses of the guru, were operating in North America with several
more around the world. Now, the only boarding school in the United
States is in Alachua, Fla., home to the largest American Hare
Krishna community.

<HEADLINE> 19-year fugitive sentenced for 1980 armed robbery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) - A fugitive who spent part of his 19 years on
the lam earning a psychology degree and counseling drug addicts in
New York City failed to persuade a judge to set him free because he
turned his life around.
</P>
<P>
   ''I specifically reject the idea that absconding from justice''
can be forgiven with a light sentence, Allegheny County Judge
Lawrence O'Toole told Martin Agurs, 58, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Agurs' attorney, Joseph K. Williams III, had asked that his
client be given credit for seven months he spent in jail since his
arrest last November and a long probation sentence. He said Agurs
could then continue his work as a drug counselor.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said Agurs' crime couldn't be ignored even if he lived
''a constructive life and then comes back and asks, 'Don't punish
me.'''
</P>
<P>
   The judge said granting Agurs' wish would have dire consequences
to the criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 14, 1980, Agurs held up a Pittsburgh pharmacy and stole
$1,859 and 4,000 prescription pills. He posted bail after his
arrest and disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   He used the name Roscoe Morrison to earn a psychology degree at
the College of New Rochelle in New Rochelle, N.Y. He then started
working at a drug counseling center in nearby New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Federal marshals in New York nearly caught him in 1990, but he
escaped when a secretary at the center warned him.
</P>
<P>
   Agurs then took another alias, Lamar Ray, and moved to Atlanta.
He worked there as a jitney driver and at a food processing plant.
He couldn't use his degree because he earned it under another name.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he returned to Pittsburgh and worked as a security
guard using his Lamar Ray alias. He returned to the city because of
a sick family member and moved from residence to residence to
escape detection.
</P>
<P>
   But in November, as he retrieved his mail at a Pittsburgh YMCA,
U.S. Marshal Bob Holtz spotted his missing right pinkie finger and
arrested him.
</P>
<P>
   The judge sentenced Agurs to three to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Allegheny County District Attorney Mark Tranquilli
said Agurs deserved some credit for turning his life around while
he was a fugitive. But he said letting him go with time served and
probation would send the wrong message to other defendants who
consider absconding.

<HEADLINE> Assad Gave Syria Stability  </HEADLINE>
By HAMZA HENDAWI
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Hafez Assad will be remembered most for
giving Syria what it desperately needed: stability. But it came at
a tremendous cost to his country.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Assad seized power in a 1970 coup, Syria had
experienced the turmoil of at least 20 military coups since
independence from France 24 years earlier, making the country the
butt of jokes in the Arab world and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   A Soviet-trained air force pilot and a shrewd politician, Assad
held the country together for 30 years with sheer force of will and
occasional outbursts of brutality. His zero tolerance for dissent
meant the jailing or killing of thousands of Syrians.
</P>
<P>
   The shortfalls of the Assad years were obvious -- human-rights
abuses, a moribund economy. But also apparent was the pride of a
nation that sees itself as the last flag-bearer of Arabism.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a virtually total absence of democracy, Assad left this
country of 17 million people in an economic time warp, symbolized
by the cars dating from the 1970s that ply the streets of the
capital. Decades of massive defense spending in a country lacking
many basic services contributed to the economic lag.
</P>
<P>
   The average monthly salary of a university graduate in Syria
today is a meager $60. The number of Syrians who have mobile
telephones is only about 4,000 -- not surprising, since it costs
about $1,500 to rent a line and buy a set. Per capita gross
domestic product shrank to a modest $837 in 1997 from $1,045 in
1995, according to figures released last year by the U.S.
Department of Commerce. More recent figures were not available.
</P>
<P>
   The country does not have a stock exchange, and widespread
corruption is eating into its resources. Foreign investment remains
below expectations and a 1991 law that relaxed investment
regulations has failed to bring about any real results.
</P>
<P>
   The economy grew by an average 5 percent in the years 1991-96,
but shrank in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The economy -- like everything else in Assad's Syria -- always
trailed the struggle against Israel on the list of priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Syria opened peace talks with Israel following the 1991 peace
conference in Madrid, but has since made little progress toward a
treaty. Throughout on-again and off-again negotiations since, Assad
had insisted on nothing short of the return of the entire Golan
Heights, captured by the Jewish state in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   His decision not to lead his negotiators in person, leaving the
task to Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa -- won him plaudits at
home, but generated unease abroad as a display of the contempt he
obviously felt for his enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Such hard-line policies, though viewed with concern abroad, have
long been a source of pride to ordinary Syrians. Although desperate
for the so-called peace dividend they hope would come with a treaty
with Israel, they saw their country -- and Assad -- as steadfast and
unyielding.
</P>
<P>
   This sense of pride, however misplaced, was a constant theme in
the information machine that surrounded Assad. Editorials and
official statements are peppered with phrases such as ''Syria is
the heart of the Arab world.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Assad's son and heir apparent, Bashar Assad, may find it
difficult to make concessions to reach a peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bashar has a heavy legacy left for him by his father: 'Not a
single inch of territory to be conceded.' It is a huge motto which
only someone like Assad the father, with all his abilities and
legitimacy, could uphold,'' said Hassan Abu Taleb, an Arab affairs
expert at Cairo's Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic
Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Any resumption of peace talks now may have to wait until the
34-year-old Bashar, who was groomed by his father to take power but
has little political base of his own, finds his feet as the new
leader.
</P>
<P>
   So wrapped up has Syria been in its conflict with Israel -- with
which it fought three full-fledged wars since 1948 -- that Hafez
Assad's Syria, with all its dreams of glory, in the end became a
backwater, largely forgotten by the outside world.

<HEADLINE> Women Seek Action After UN Meeting  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Armed with renewed backing from more than
180 nations and an updated plan to achieve equality of the sexes,
thousands of participants are returning home from a U.N. women's
conference determined to stop making speeches and start taking
action.
</P>
<P>
   Five years after the largest global gathering of women in
history, the nations of the world met to review the landmark
150-page platform for action that they adopted in Beijing. They not
only gave it a thumbs up but added some tougher measures.
</P>
<P>
   ''Member states in the United Nations system now have a clearly
defined roadmap for the continuing journey toward gender
equality,'' Assistant Secretary-General Angela King, the U.N.
special adviser on gender issues, said Monday. ''The will to act
was demonstrated by governments.''
</P>
<P>
   She pointed to new measures to combat domestic violence, sex
trafficking and the impact of globalization on women. ''The women
of the world now have a tool to assist them in achieving their
goals,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Getting more than 180 nations to reach consensus on an updated
roadmap was a long and difficult process. The weeklong special
session of the General Assembly, scheduled to end Friday, didn't
finish until Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   There was relief from Secretary-General Kofi Annan and dozens of
governments, including the United States, which feared that the
conference would backtrack on Beijing's gains for women.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most wonderful thing is that there's no sliding back,''
said Noeleen Heyzer, executive director of the United Nations
Development Fund for Women. ''It is extremely important now that we
go from words into action.''
</P>
<P>
   She called for greater accountability to achieve equality in
education, jobs and decision-making. She urged governments and the
private sector to earmark more money to implement the Beijing
platform. And she said the U.N. agency ''will support as many
governments as possible'' in reviewing laws that discriminate
against women by 2005, as called for by last week's conference.
</P>
<P>
   The new document notes that the Convention on the Elimination of
Discrimination Against Women -- the legal cornerstone of women's
equality -- has been signed by 165 nations but failed to achieve the
goal of universal ratification by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   During the conference, Saudi Arabia announced that it would sign
the convention and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
the Clinton administration had intensified efforts to get the
Senate to ratify it.
</P>
<P>
   The battle lines for last week's conference -- known as Beijing
Plus Five -- mirrored those at Beijing: the Vatican and a handful of
Islamic and Catholic countries -- including Libya, Algeria, Iran,
Sudan and Nicaragua -- against the West and thousands of women's
rights activists.
</P>
<P>
   As at Beijing, the most contentious issues dealt with sexual and
reproductive issues.
</P>
<P>
   Adrienne Germain, president of the International Women's Health
Coalition and a member of the U.S. delegation to Beijing, said
Monday that one major achievement last week was ''a real
obstruction of the right-wing effort to take us backward.''
</P>
<P>
   She pointed to the follow-up document's support for education
programs and services on reproductive and sexual health for
adolescents and a restatement of language urging governments to
review laws that punish women for having abortions and its
references to sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ''So it's clear now that sexuality, like gender, is an issue
that governments cannot deny or ignore,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   What voluntary organizations are committed to now, Germain said,
''is developing innovative projects that can show governments how
to change policies.''
</P>
<P>
   But the problems that women face at the start of the 21st
century were graphically recounted as the conference closed, a
reminder to those returning home.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates from embattled Sierra Leone and Congo said they were
missing the key prerequisite to implement the Beijing platform:
peace. Africans spoke of the AIDS pandemic destroying the social
fabric of the continent. Asians spoke about the financial crisis
leaving women without enough to eat and an upsurge in trafficking,
forced prostitution and so-called honor killings.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Kidnapping Investigator Dead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CUERNAVACA, Mexico (AP) -- An anti-kidnapping investigator has
been found dead along a highway in central Mexico, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   Poseidon Rios Ramirez, 34, was run over by a car along the
central Mexican highway between Cuernavaca and Acapulco. His body
was found Monday. Morelos state Attorney General Rogelio Sanchez
Gatica said authorities have not ruled out foul play.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, an investigator in the Morelos district attorney's
office, worked with a special state anti-kidnapping unit.
Kidnappings for ransom have become one of Mexico's most feared
crimes in recent years, with victims ranging from middle-class
farmers to the president of Mexico's largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   A number of the kidnappings have occurred in Morelos. The
state's governor and top police officials were toppled in 1998
after the state police anti-kidnapping unit itself was implicated
in kidnappings.

<HEADLINE> Los Alamos Nuclear Secrets Missing  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Investigators are intensely looking for two
computer hard drives, containing nuclear weapons secrets,
discovered missing from a vault at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory in New Mexico. The incident is prompting renewed
questions in Congress over security at the federal research labs.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of the nuclear weapons data was discovered
more than a month ago, but was not made known to senior Energy
Department officials until June 1. It was disclosed publicly Monday
after a weeklong investigation by three dozen FBI and Energy
Department agents who swept down on the lab.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very sensitive ... technical data,'' retired Air Force
Gen. Eugene Habiger, the Energy Department's security chief, said.
He briefed Energy Secretary Bill Richardson on Monday on the
disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   The drives were found missing May 7 as the lab was threatened by
wildfires that forced an evacuation three days later, officials
said. The two drives may have been misplaced or accidentally
destroyed in the confusion surrounding the oncoming fire that
burned thousands of acres in and around Los Alamos, N.M., including
some of the laboratory, last month.
</P>
<P>
   Habiger was expected to be questioned on the missing nuclear
secrets at a House Commerce Committee hearing today. The House
Intelligence Committee was considering hearings later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Senior DOE officials, however, expressed doubt that the
disappearance of the two hard drives -- each just a little larger
than a deck of cards -- involves espionage, although they have not
ruled it out completely.
</P>
<P>
   ''The indicators are just not there,'' said Ed Curran, DOE's
director of counterintelligence. Still, he said everyone with
access to the material or vault will be given a polygraph.
</P>
<P>
   The two drives, each containing identical information, were used
by the Nuclear Emergency Search Team, or NEST, which is trained to
respond to nuclear accidents or terrorist act. The drives contain
highly technical nuclear weapons data needed to render weapons safe
in an emergency, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It provides the tools for nuclear physicists and weapons
designers (on the response team) to do their work,'' said Habiger,
who declined to be more specific. He also refused to acknowledge a
report that the drives included information on Russian nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the computer drives are found, it is an embarrassment
for the Los Alamos lab, where the nuclear bomb was built more than
a half-century ago. The lab was the center of a security
controversy during most of 1999 surrounding allegations against one
of its former scientists, Wen Ho Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was arrested in December on a 59-count indictment that
charged him with copying top secret computer files that have never
been found. Although under investigation for three years in
connection with the alleged loss of U.S. nuclear secrets to China,
Lee has not been charged with espionage. In jail awaiting trial,
Lee has denied giving secrets to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours after disclosure of the latest incident, some
members of Congress questioned whether security had improved. It
demonstrates that ''the Department of Energy and its labs still
have a long way to go,'' said Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va., the Commerce
Committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an extremely serious matter, and we are taking swift
actions to deal with it,'' said John Browne, the Los Alamos lab
director. The drives disappeared from a vault in the highly secured
''X Division'' where the lab's nuclear weapons designers work.
</P>
<P>
   Officials intimately involved in the investigation gave this
account of events:
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos lab officials late on May 7 found the two drives
missing when they checked the vault as wildfires threatened the
laboratory complex. Three days later the lab was evacuated because
of the fire and did not resume operation until May 22, preventing a
detailed search for the material.
</P>
<P>
   After May 22, Los Alamos officials began searching computers,
safes, containers and vaults and interviewed staff members with
access to the vault, but did not report the missing material for 10
days. A week ago, 22 FBI agents and 12 DOE investigators, led by
Habiger, flew to Los Alamos to search and question those with
access to the vault. They have found no trace, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Guidelines for Fighting Migraines  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Headache sufferers wondering if a migraine is to
blame, and if
so what to do, have some new resources.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Migraine specialists recently devised the first guidelines for
primary care physicians to use in picking a treatment, guidelines
that explain what scientific evidence is behind each medication.
</P>
<P>
   For example, drugs used to prevent migraines include
anti-epilepsy drugs that work by inhibiting abnormal firing of
brain cells linked to migraines, as well as heart-related
medications like verapamil and certain antidepressants. Each has
pros and cons.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the guidelines discuss who is the best candidate for
the most powerful prescription migraine treatments -- four drugs
called ''triptans'' -- or other prescription and over-the-counter
pain relievers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the guidelines are largely written in medical jargon,
patients can read them on the Internet at http://www.aan.com.

<HEADLINE> Migraines Are Unique Brain Disorder  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The pain of a migraine can be so intense it's
disabling. Your head pulses, usually on one side, for hours or even
days. Moving worsens the throbbing. You're nauseated, sensitive to
light and sound. Sometimes you have an ''aura,'' seeing pinpoints
of light or other visual disturbances before the headache hits.
</P>
<P>
   Some 28 million Americans suffer this pain, yet half don't
realize that migraines -- and not some other headache -- are to
blame, and millions go without treatment.
</P>
<P>
   That's particularly disturbing to experts because, in a
revolutionary shift, scientists are discovering that migraines are
caused not by the abnormal blood vessels once blamed but by a
unique electrical disorder of brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   The findings open new avenues to attack these tenacious
headaches, and suggest treating migraines is important because
people who suffer very frequent attacks seem vulnerable to physical
changes inside the brain that could lead to chronic pain.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should probably be treating very quickly,'' Dr. K. Michael
Welch of the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City,
whose neurological research is spurring this new view of migraines,
told a recent meeting at the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   One-fifth of sufferers are candidates for medicines that can cut
frequent attacks by half, yet fewer than 1 million get preventive
therapy, said Dr. Richard Lipton of New York's Albert Einstein
College of Medicine. Once a migraine hits, only a fraction use the
most powerful prescription treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Too many primary care physicians don't know how to treat
migraines, specialists say.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent seminar, only 45 percent of family physicians shown
migraine symptoms got the diagnosis right. Plus, only one-third of
patients have that classic aura before an attack -- yet many doctors
erroneously think no aura means no migraine, Lipton said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists once thought migraines were caused by abnormally
dilated blood vessels. Hence, many pain relievers work by
constricting blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   But new imaging devices allow scientists to watch patients'
brains during a migraine attack, and they're discovering sufferers
have abnormally excitable neurons, or brain nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   When something triggers a migraine, those neurons suddenly fire
off electrical pulses at the back of the brain, firings that ripple
across the brain's top and then back down to the brainstem, where
important pain centers are located, Welch explains. This electrical
''wave'' spreads like water ripples when you throw a pebble in a
lake.
</P>
<P>
   In minutes, blood flow jumps, until the wave passes and blood
flow sharply drops.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting pain comes from either the brainstem activation or
blood vessels inflamed by the rapidly changing blood flow -- or
both.
</P>
<P>
   Experiments in which scientists use a powerful magnet to
stimulate neurons provide startling evidence that some people's
brains are predisposed to hyperexcitability. When people prone to
migraines were stimulated, they literally saw spots similar to a
migraine's aura. One even went into a migraine as spellbound
scientists watched. But when people who don't get migraines were
stimulated, their neurons weren't affected.
</P>
<P>
   In real life what triggers these neurons? Too much or too little
sleep, hunger, bright lights, certain foods, women's fluctuating
estrogen levels.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the push for treatment, very frequent migraine attacks
seem to physically change the brainstem's pain centers, sometimes
leading to constant headaches, Welch says.
</P>
<P>
   While scientists use the findings to hunt better treatments,
helpful medicines are already available.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, some drugs that fight epilepsy by suppressing
abnormal neuron firings -- Depakote and gabapentin -- also prevent
migraines, says Dr. Stephen Silberstein of Thomas Jefferson
University Hospital in Philadelphia. The four most powerful
prescription treatments, called ''triptans,'' shrink inflamed blood
vessels. And women often are helped by adjusting birth control or
hormone therapy to stabilize estrogen levels.
</P>
<P>
   The treatments aren't perfect. But too many patients never see a
doctor, or see one who follows the outdated practice of trying less
powerful drugs first, Lipton says. His advice: Don't give up -- if
one drug doesn't help, demand another.

<HEADLINE> More Students Attend Summer School  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- All year, Wayne Proctor watched his
second-grade daughter struggle with learning fractions and counting
money. So when her teacher recommended summer school for math,
Proctor was grateful.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the long haul, we have to begin to realize that summer
school is not a punishment,'' said Proctor, a copy center manager
whose daughter Jeannelle, 8, attends Stevens Elementary in the
District of Columbia. ''I know she's not a person who hates school.
This year has just been different from what she's used to.''
</P>
<P>
   More students than ever are swamping summer school classes as
educational systems seek to end social promotion of students who
aren't ready for the next grade or provide enrichment programs for
more successful pupils.
</P>
<P>
   District of Columbia schools estimate that 22,000 of its 71,000
students will be back in class when the academic year ends next
week, up slightly from last year. New York City schools expect
250,000 students this summer, seven times what the million-student
district had last year. And Detroit schools, requiring summer
classes for the first time, project 30,000 to 35,000 of their
167,000 total students will attended summer school, a fourfold
increase over the 1999 voluntary program.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a third of the nation's 15,000 districts require summer
school classes for children who fail certain standardized tests,
receive low marks from teachers or skip school regularly. Twice as
many offer special classes, summer camps and fun activities for
younger children and non-working high school students.
</P>
<P>
   As enrollments rise, so do costs. Five weeks of summer schooling
for its mandatory Summer Academies of Learning program will cost
Detroit $12 million for staff, supplies and other needs, which
officials said was about four times the expense of last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, it has been a tremendous strain on the budget,'' said
Stan Childress, Detroit schools spokesman, ''but we have to take
the first step to end social promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and other policymakers have urged school
districts to abandon social promotion, a practice allowing students
to move up to the next level even if they have not mastered the
basics for the current grade.
</P>
<P>
   There's been some opposition to banning the practice, usually
from educators who warn that holding students back can be just as
harmful and unproductive if the type and quality of summer
instruction isn't better than what they received during the school
year. But districts have forged ahead with expanding their summer
schools.
</P>
<P>
   In Detroit, officials looked at transportation, food service and
other support services with an eye toward streamlining the costs or
privatizing the operations altogether, Childress said.
</P>
<P>
   The District of Columbia schools, whose summer school budget
went from $14 million last year to $9 million this year in an
across-the-board school spending cutback, has had to cut out a week
and reduce some training for aides. Mary H. Gill, deputy chief
academic officer for the system, said the programs should be
thought of as essential.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not baby-sitting by any means,'' Gill said. ''Everyone
can't afford to send their children to the best of camps or other
things that are going to enrich their minds. We are trying to make
sure the growth that's made during the year is sustained. It's good
use of our tax dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Even private and charter schools -- without the outright public
mandates to boost learning -- are increasing summer programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see an opportunity to do some things with the students that
we've not been able to do within the regular school year,'' said
Kenneth Green, principal of the Booker T. Washington Public Charter
School in the district. Roughly 60 of the high school's 149
students will start classes June 26 to catch up on graduation
credits in English and algebra or enrichment courses on photography
or making television documentaries.
</P>
<P>
   Green said the school's administrators and parents readily
agreed to support the programs, knowing the children would be
productive over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't buy into the fact that learning should stop,'' Green
said. ''I've seen what happens over the summer and you start back
in September with a great deal of catching up.''

<HEADLINE> Warrant Issued for Mexican Activist  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   McALLEN, Texas (AP) -- Mexican police issued an arrest warrant
Monday for a Mexican activist who promised to pay $10,000 for
anyone who killed a U.S. Border Patrol agent.
</P>
<P>
   The warrant charges Carlos Ibarra Perez, 60, a former oil
worker, of publicly provoking the commission of a crime, The
(McAllen) Monitor reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ibarra, a spokesman for an advocacy group called the Citizen
Defense Committee, said he made the offer because too many
undocumented immigrants were being slain by federal agents and
private landowners while making their way into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, Ibarra denied he made the offer during an interview
at a San Diego radio station.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm saying a different thing now,'' Ibarra told KFMB through
an interpreter. ''I'm saying that we avoid violence. I'm saying
we're not supporting this situation of sending people to kill
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican authorities said they issued the warrant after
interviewing about a dozen reporters who attended a June 5 press
conference in Reynosa, Mexico, when Ibarra announced the reward.
</P>
<P>
   ''Provoking a crime, whether it be inside or outside this
country, is a crime and I have the necessary elements to
prosecute,'' said Jesus Trevino, a prosecutor with the Tamaulipas
state attorney general's office in Reynosa.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Ibarra could face up to a year in jail.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Leader Arrives for Summit  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The leaders of South Korea and North
Korea greeted each other for the first time Tuesday, clapping,
shaking hands and striding down a red carpet together near the
North's capital in a step toward ending the Cold War on the divided
Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving for a historic three-day summit, South Korean President
Kim Dae-jung's jet landed at an airport on the outskirts of
Pyongyang. His counterpart, Kim Jong Il, greeted him along with a
military brass band, goose-stepping soldiers with fixed bayonets
and women dressed in traditional, billowing Korean gowns.
</P>
<P>
   The two men rode together in a black limousine into Pyongyang,
where hundreds of thousands of orderly North Koreans lined block
after block of broad avenues, waving bouquets of pink paper
flowers. The spectators appeared to direct their emotion at Kim
Jong Il, whose name they chanted in unison as the motorcade passed
a huge stone arch and other imposing monuments.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Jong Il, who enjoys a personality cult in the closed-off,
communist north, often receives such displays from his people.
</P>
<P>
   The pudgy Kim Jong Il normally shuns publicity and rarely meets
visiting dignitaries, but he appeared relaxed and was dressed in a
khaki, open-necked shirt and trousers. He welcomed Kim Dae-jung,
wearing a dark suit, at the foot of his plane. The two leaders
exchanged a few words while reviewing a military parade and then
left together.
</P>
<P>
   At a guesthouse, the two Kims posed for photographs in front of
a mural of crashing waves and sat side by side in armchairs. Kim
Dae-jung told Kim Jong Il that he hoped the two Koreas ''will end
hostility and open a new era of reconciliation and cooperation,''
according to South Korean pool reports.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean president had planned to appeal for solidarity
from North Koreans in a prepared speech at the airport, but North
Korean officials swiftly guided him into the car before he could do
so. ''I love you all,'' read one excerpt from Kim's speech, which
was handed to media in Seoul and Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   The summit offers the greatest hope for peace on the divided
Korean peninsula in more than 50 years. Leaders of South Korea and
North Korea have never met since the two countries were founded in
1948 in the Cold War's infancy, and the conflict between two
populations that speak the same language and share the same ethnic
roots has been bitter and bloody.
</P>
<P>
   During the summit, Kim Dae-jung is expected to ask Kim Jong Il
to agree to reunions of separated families, a summit sequel in
Seoul and other conciliatory gestures in exchange for economic
resources from the South. Though endowed with long-range missile
capabilities, North Korea was unable to feed its own people in the
late 1990s and today is reliant on food aid from its traditional
foes: South Korea, Japan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Seoul, Kim Dae-jung said he planned to talk
candidly with Kim Jong Il and hoped to learn about the thinking of
the reclusive head of the totalitarian regime. He warned that the
reconciliation process will be lengthy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that it will be a turning point in efforts to remove
threats to war and terminate the Cold War on the Korean Peninsula
so that all 70 million Korean people in the South and North can
live in peace,'' Kim said in a speech on a runway at a military
airport in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Reunification -- the stated goal of both nations -- also is likely
to be a lengthy and difficult process. The first summit between
leaders of East Germany and West Germany was held in 1970, two
decades before the dismantling of the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   Animosity and suspicion remain fresh in the Koreas a
half-century after the communist North, backed by the Soviet Union
and joined by Chinese troops, fought the pro-Western South and its
U.S.-led allies.
</P>
<P>
   The 1950-53 Korean War left up to 5 million people dead, injured
or missing. Its legacy lingers most vividly at the Demilitarized
Zone, a buffer area that separates hundreds of thousands of troops,
tanks and artillery pieces on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, concerns over the North's purported nuclear weapons
program nearly triggered a military conflict. And North Korea's
totalitarian government -- based on a personality cult that
virtually deifies Kim Jong Il and his late father and national
founder, Kim Il Sung -- had been reclusive for so long that
reconciliation seemed a doubtful dream.
</P>
<P>
   Yet driven partly by desperation for economic aid to rebuild its
dilapidated economy, the North embarked on a new course over the
last year, seeking diplomatic contacts with the outside world that
culminated in the decision to host an inter-Korean summit.
</P>
<P>
   The celebratory mood now is such that The Korea Times, an
English-language daily, compared the summit to the 1969 landing of
a man on the moon. ''One small step for reconciliation, one giant
leap for reunification,'' the newspaper declared.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea barred non-Korean reporters from attending the
summit, allowing only 50 South Korean journalists to join Kim
Dae-jung's entourage. Kim's arrival was televised live in the
South.
</P>
<P>
   Korea's leaders have a host of touchy issues to resolve, among
them North Korea's missile and nuclear programs and the 37,000 U.S.
troops deployed in South Korea. Their role has been to deter the
North, which is believed to have stockpiles of chemical weapons and
one of the world's largest standing armies.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea is hosting the summit in the mysterious style that
it has often employed over the years. It delayed the meeting for a
day without a clear explanation and has refused to announce the
schedule, possibly out of concern for the security of Kim Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
   The summit pairs two men whose careers reflect the political
gulf that separates democratic South Korea and communist North
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   As an opposition leader, South Korea's Kim was jailed, sentenced
to death and, he says, the target of four assassination attempts.
He won election to the nation's top office on his fourth attempt,
and he has received international accolades as a defender of human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   The North's Kim, on the other hand, was reared from childhood to
succeed his father as head of a totalitarian state. He is suspected
of masterminding terrorist attacks on South Korean targets,
including the 1987 bombing of a Korean Air plane that killed all
115 people on board.
</P>
<P>
   The two Kims planned to meet Tuesday and on at least one other
occasion, and their governments have agreed not to use national
flags and anthems to avoid political or ideological frictions.

<HEADLINE> Wildfire Burns Colo. Homes  </HEADLINE>
By P. SOLOMON BANDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINE JUNCTION, Colo. (AP) -- A fast-moving wildfire burned houses
on Monday, forcing residents to flee with only their pets and
prompting the evacuation of nearly 180 girls and staff members from
a Girl Scout camp.
</P>
<P>
   The Hi Meadow Fire burned at least 2,000 acres, destroyed at
least four houses and forced 200 to 300 people to evacuate from
houses near Bailey, about 35 miles southwest of Denver, said Doug
Lee, a spokesman for the fire management team. No injuries were
reported.
</P>
<P>
   A second fire near a subdivision in the mountains west of
Loveland had burned at least two homes, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   They were the most damaging wildfires burning across a number of
Western states, including Arizona, California, New Mexico and Utah.
Smoke from both blazes hung over parts of the Denver metropolitan
area.
</P>
<P>
   The Hi Meadows fire began Monday morning and rapidly spread
through parched brush and timber. The cause was not known, but the
region has had little moisture in months. About 100 firefighters
were on the lines.
</P>
<P>
   David Wortman and his wife loaded their horses into a trailer,
hitched it to their pickup and fled with their dog when the flames
came within 50 yards of their house. They could feel the heat
inside the truck.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once I saw the flames that close, we had to get out,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials evacuated 140 girls and 38 staffers from the Flying G
camp as a precaution, even though the fire was moving away from the
camp, said Rachelle Trujillo, a spokeswoman for the Girl Scouts'
Mile High Council.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze near Loveland in Larimer County grew from 40 acres
late in the morning to about 2,000 acres by evening, authorities
said. Two structures had burned and some 300 were threatened but no
injuries had been reported, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross opened shelters near both fires, and Gov. Bill
Owens said the Colorado National Guard was ready to help.
</P>
<P>
   Only three people registered to stay at a Red Cross shelter in
Loveland, but more than 200 registered at two shelters near Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of tension in both the shelters,'' Red Cross
spokesman Matt Bertram said. ''There will be no good night's sleep
here tonight.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Neanderthals Ate Mostly Meat  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- If you ever have a Neanderthal over for a
backyard barbecue, forget the salad, the corn on the cob and the
baked potato. All he'll want is the meat, and lots of it.
</P>
<P>
   A new study of Neanderthal bones suggests that what the hominid
28,000 years ago had for dinner -- and for breakfast and lunch -- was
meat, and very little else.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their diet was about 90 percent meat,'' said Paul B. Pettitt
of Oxford University in England, co-author of a study appearing
Tuesday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
''This means they were efficient hunters and not just scavengers as
some have suggested.''
</P>
<P>
   A life so centered on meat, said Pettitt, means that the
lowbrowed, hairy Neanderthal was able to organize complex hunts
that brought down big and dangerous game.
</P>
<P>
   ''This study suggests that the difference between Neanderthals
and modern humans was only a matter of degree,'' said Erik
Trinkaus, a Washington University at St. Louis anthropologist and
co-author of the study. ''Modern humans were probably more
efficient in terms of their organization, but the Neanderthals were
very close.''
</P>
<P>
   Neanderthal-like hominids first appeared in Europe, probably
migrating from Africa, around 300,000 years ago, said Pettitt. The
''classic'' period of Neanderthal presence in Europe started about
120,000 years ago. By about 28,000 years ago, the Neanderthal was
gone from the fossil record, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Modern humans arrived in Europe about 32,000 years ago, about
4,000 years before the Neanderthal disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts have suggested that the more primitive Neanderthal
was simply overwhelmed and outhunted by his more sophisticated
cousin. Others say the Neanderthal was biologically absorbed by
early modern humans and disappeared as a distinct and separate
species.
</P>
<P>
   Trinkaus said the new study does not settle that debate, but it
does show the Neanderthal was not just simple, stupid and brutish.
</P>
<P>
   ''This study implies a much higher degree of social organization
complexity than is frequently attributed to the Neanderthals,''
said Trinkaus. ''They were much more equal to modern humans in many
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   One big difference, though, was food choices.
</P>
<P>
   Studies of bones from the early modern humans in Europe suggest
they had a more varied diet, eating smaller animals, such as
rabbits, and lots of fish -- up to 30 percent of their diet.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Neanderthal, it was meat, meat and more meat.
</P>
<P>
   Europe of 28,000 years ago was enjoying a warm period between
two extremes of the Ice Age, Pettitt said. The plains of Europe
were grassy and probably included vast herds of animals, which he
calls ''lawn mowers.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Neanderthal hunter preyed on mammoth, horse,
deer, woolly rhino and other large animals.
</P>
<P>
   When conditions changed and fewer of these animals were
available, the Neanderthal may have had a more difficult time
adjusting than did the competing humans who lived on a more varied
diet, said Pettitt.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers probed the diet of the Neanderthal by measuring
the isotopic ratios of nitrogen in skulls and jawbones recovered
from a cave in Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our bones record the isotope signatures of the foods we have
eaten in our lifetimes,'' co-author Fred H. Smith of Northern
Illinois University said in a statement. ''By measuring these
isotope signatures in fossil bones, we can reconstruct aspects of
the diets.''
</P>
<P>
   Bones formed from a diet rich in meat contain a high ratio of an
isotope called nitrogen-15, said Trinkaus. The nitrogen-15 ratio of
Neanderthal, he said, was almost like that of an African lion,
which means a diet of meat and almost nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   This is in contrast to the modern American diet, said Trinkaus,
which is 20 percent to 30 percent meat or other animal products.
The rest of the diet comes from vegetables, fruits and other
plants.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 4, Dodgers 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Travis Lee homered and drove in two runs, and
Brian Anderson won for the 12th time in 13 decisions as the Arizona
Diamondbacks beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 4-2 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, in front of just 25,552, ended a five-game road
losing streak for the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson (6-1) allowed two runs and eight hits in six innings,
after surrendering a club-record nine earned runs over 5 2-3
innings last Wednesday at Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander struck out four, walked two and escaped a
bases-loaded jam in the sixth -- starting a 1-2-3 double play after
fielding Chad Kreuter's comebacker and then striking out Jose
Vizcaino.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Padilla pitched two perfect innings, and Byung-Hyun Kim
got three outs for his ninth save in 11 opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers did not have another baserunner after loading the
bases with no outs in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   With catcher Todd Hundley on the disabled list with a strained
muscle in his right side, the Dodgers nearly lost Kreuter in the
third inning when Arizona took a 2-1 lead against Darren Dreifort
(4-4).
</P>
<P>
   Turner Ward led off with a double, advanced on a wild pitch and
scored on a safety-squeeze bunt by Anderson that followed a walk to
Kelly Stinnett to tie it a 1.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Womack's single sent Stinnett to third, and he scored the
go-ahead run when Womack's takeout slide at second broke up a
potential double-play grounder by Craig Counsell.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Kevin Elster made a wild relay throw to the home side
of first base on the play, and Kreuter appeared to jam his left
(non-throwing) thumb diving to keep the ball from rolling into the
dugout. He was looked over by assistant trainer Matt Wilson and
allowed to stay in.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort was charged with four runs, three earned, and five hits
in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks, who swept a three-game series from the Dodgers
in Phoenix last month, made it 3-1 in the fourth. Matt Williams
reached on a fielding error at third by Vizcaino, stole his first
base of the season and scored on Lee's double.
</P>
<P>
   Elster closed it to 3-2 in the bottom half of the fourth with
his 10th homer. Lee regained the Dodgers' two-run lead in the sixth
with his seventh home run, his first since coming off the disabled
list last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Dreifort beat out Anderson for the 1993 Golden Spikes Award
as the nation's top amateur player. Anderson's 3-0 victory over
Dreifort last July began his streak of 11 consecutive winning
decisions. ... Dreifort and Anderson were picked second and third
overall in the '93 draft -- Dreifort by the Dodgers out of Wichita
State, and Anderson by the Angels out of Wright State in Dayton,
Ohio. ... Comedian Jon Lovitz served as public address announcer
during the second inning and announced the starting lineups. Lovitz
also has worked the p.a. during the Dodgers' annual Hollywood Stars
games. ... Ward tried to suprise Dreifort with a straight steal of
home in the sixth inning, but was thrown out easily.

<HEADLINE> Giants 10, Reds 3  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Joe Nathan scattered seven hits in eight
innings and hit his first big league homer as the San Francisco
Giants routed the Cincinnati Reds 10-3 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Benard added a two-run homer, and Bobby Estalella and
Ellis Burks hit solo shots in Dusty Baker's 587th career victory,
the most by a San Francisco manager, one ahead of Roger Craig.
Baker is 587-541 in eight seasons with the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Burks had three hits and three RBIs, J.T. Snow hit a two-run
double and Jeff Kent added an RBI double, helping San Francisco
avoid consecutive losses at home for the first time since dropping
its first six games at Pacific Bell Park.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan (3-1) struck out four and walked two in winning for the
first time since he was activated June 6 following one month on the
disabled list with tendinitis. He had been tagged for 12 runs at
Colorado on May 12 in his start before going on the DL.
</P>
<P>
   A converted shortstop, Nathan homered off reliever Dennys Reyes
in the seventh, driving a 3-2 offering over the center-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Bell (4-5) allowed five runs and four hits in four innings,
losing for the third time in four decisions. He walked a
career-high six and struck out none as the Reds lost for the sixth
time in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan benefited from solid defensive work that included double
plays in the sixth and fourth innings. The Reds' only run before
the ninth came on Dmitri Young's RBI single in the fourth. Eddie
Taubensee and Chris Stynes drove in ninth-inning runs off Alan
Embree.
</P>
<P>
   Estalella got San Francisco going when he connected for his
seventh homer with two outs in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Bell issued consecutive walks to Bill Mueller and Barry Bonds
before Kent doubled, scoring Mueller. Center fielder Ken Griffey
Jr.'s relayed throw got Bonds at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Burks led off the fourth with his seventh homer of the season
and, after Estalella walked and stole second on a disputed play,
Benard homered for a 5-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Burks added a run-scoring double in the fifth and an RBI single
in the sixth. Snow's two-run double also came in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: First daughter Chelsea Clinton, a student at nearby
Stanford, attended the game as a guest of Giants executive vice
president Larry Baer. ... The six walks by Bell were the most in a
game by a Reds pitcher this season. ... Estalella has seven homers
this season, one short of his career high established in 1998 while
with Philadelphia. ... Giants SS Rich Aurilia, who strained his
left hamstring on May 30, wasn't in the starting lineup for a
second straight day and manager Dusty Baker said he'll probably
take Tuesday off as well. ... Reds RF Dante Bichette was not in the
starting lineup after leaving Sunday's game against the Indians
with a mild sprain in his left ankle. He's day to day. ... The Reds
failed to homer for the first time in 13 games. ... Taubensee got
his first RBI in 25 games since May 3.

<HEADLINE> Report: Titans, Fisher Reach Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Tennessee Titans and Jeff Fisher
reportedly reached an agreement that will make the coach of the AFC
champions one of the NFL's highest paid.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans and Fisher could disclose details on Tuesday of a
contract extension that will keep him with the team through the
2003 season, according to reports by The Tennessean and WKRN-TV of
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, who has one year left on his current contract, gave the
Titans a deadline of Thursday, the end of the team's minicamp, to
complete negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, Titans president Jeff Diamond, and Marvin Demoff,
Fisher's agent, could not be reached for comment Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The new contract is expected to put Fisher in the same salary
range as Pittsburgh coach Bill Cowher, Jacksonville coach Tom
Coughlin and Carolina coach George Seifert. Each earns between $2.2
and $2.5 million a season.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle coach Mike Holmgren is the league's highest-paid coach
at $4 million a year. He also serves as the Seahawks' director of
football operations.
</P>
<P>
   Signed in 1996, Fisher's old contract paid him between $800,000
and $900,000 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher and team officials agreed if no new deal was struck
before Thursday, no more talks would be held until the end of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher became the then-Houston Oilers head coach in November
1994, given the job on an interim basis in the midst of a 2-14
season.
</P>
<P>
   Team owner Bud Adams gave Fisher the job permanently in January
1995, and extended the contract through the 2000 season, the first
time he did that for one of his coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Before Fisher coached his first game in August 1995, Adams
announced he was talking with Nashville about relocating his
franchise from Houston.
</P>
<P>
   That kept Fisher busier answering questions about changing
stadiums than coaching his team until last summer. In 1999, the
renamed Titans only had one move left -- into their permanent
practice facility.
</P>
<P>
   With no distractions, Fisher led the Titans to his first winning
record as a head coach (13-3) and the franchise's first Super Bowl
appearance, a 23-16 loss to the St. Louis Rams.

<HEADLINE> Direct U.S.-Cuba Travel Increases  </HEADLINE>
By KEN GUGGENHEIM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of people who flew directly from
the United States to Cuba soared by almost 50 percent last year as
travelers took advantage of eased restrictions aimed at planting
democratic seeds on the communist island.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration last year streamlined procedures for
students, athletes, artists and other groups and individuals to
visit Cuba. It also allowed a greater variety of direct flights,
which previously operated only between Miami and Havana.
</P>
<P>
   The measures were aimed at encouraging contacts between Cubans
and Americans, helping Cubans in their first attempts to ''form a
civil society in Cuba that is genuine -- nongovernmental
organizations that are nongovernmental organizations,'' Charles
Shapiro, head of the State Department's Cuban Affairs Office, said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people flying directly from the United States to
Cuba increased by about 47 percent last year: About 82,000 people
flew in 1999, compared with 55,900 in 1998, according to statistics
recently compiled by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign
Assets Control. The office enforces the economic embargo that
prohibits most Americans from spending money in Cuba -- effectively
barring them from visiting.
</P>
<P>
   The overall number of people who fly from the United States to
Cuba is unknown. Many take flights, legally or illegally, through
third countries, such as Canada or Mexico. Cuban officials have
said that 160,000 U.S. citizens visited their country last year,
almost double the number who took direct flights.
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts the number of Americans visiting Cuba is rising.
Charter companies have added flights to meet the demand and are
flying under the new rules from New York and Los Angeles, as well
as from Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest group of travelers are people visiting relatives in
Cuba, U.S. officials say. They can visit once a year without a
Treasury Department license.
</P>
<P>
   The number of nonrelatives who visit Cuba is growing rapidly,
however. For Marazul Tours, which arranges travel to Cuba, the
business has increased fourfold, said Bob Guild, program director
for the Weehawken, N.J.-based travel agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's certainly always been an interest,'' Guild said. Red
tape used to discourage travelers, he said. Researchers needed to
apply for licenses, and university groups needed a license for each
member.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, many researchers no longer need to request
licenses, and universities need only one license for a group --
regardless of how many people travel.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro, of the State Department, said there is no way to gauge
the effectiveness of what the government calls ''people-to-people
contacts.'' But he said he takes ''as an article of faith'' that if
Americans travel to Cuba for purposes other than tourism, and
interact with Cubans, it will have an impact.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given the contest between an open society and a closed
society, the open society will win,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Activists against President Fidel Castro's government are more
skeptical. Jose Cardenas, spokesman for the Cuban American National
Foundation, noted that the Cuban government still determines who
will enter the country and often sets travelers' itineraries.
Travelers may have more contact with Communist Party officials than
with ordinary Cubans, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rather than people-to-people contact, what we're seeing is a
lot of people-to-party contact,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., strongly anti-Castro, said there's no
indication that years of visits by Canadian, European and Latin
American tourists have helped ordinary Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   With travel restrictions eased, American visits to Cuba are
undermining the embargo and providing the Cuban government with
much-needed dollars, Menendez said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What Americans are unwittingly doing, is in going to the
hotels and the beaches and spending their money in those places,
they' re ultimately fueling the regime,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Cabinet Backs Gore  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the Reagan White House, ''Bush for
President'' neckties weren't passed around until late August. But
Cabinet-level electioneering for Al Gore is well underway in the
Clinton White House -- with nary a distinction between the old guard
and the wannabes.
</P>
<P>
   No longer dogmatic about disentangling himself from the Clinton
administration, Gore is stumping this week with former Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin, whom campaign insiders have nicknamed ''the
running mate.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's embrace of Gore ''is a very positive and powerful symbol
of continuity in economic policy, given Rubin's track record, is
recognized on Wall Street and Main Street as well,'' said economist
Mark Zandi of RFA Dismal Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest speak-no-ill phase, Gore also is relying on
administration stars to step up to the microphone and criticize
Republican rival George W. Bush's policy proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Recent examples:
</P>
<P>
   -- Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala gathered
campaign reporters on a conference call to denounce Bush's
long-term care proposal hours after he announced it in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   -- Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo challenged Bush on gun control
in exactly the same language Gore used a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   -- Even Republican Defense Secretary William Cohen joined in,
disguising criticism of Bush's arms control agenda as a polite
offer to brief Bush on defense issues.
</P>
<P>
   -- Army Secretary Louis Caldera accompanied Gore on an official
trip to the West Point commencement ceremony and defended the vice
president's speech -- a veiled criticism of Bush's arms-control
strategy -- as perfectly apolitical.
</P>
<P>
   Some Clinton administration surrogates have made clear they
would relish being part of a Gore administration, most prominently
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who has campaigned with the vice
president and is mentioned as a possible running mate.
</P>
<P>
   This record of assists underscores Gore's intention to soften
his image by leaving the attacks to others, but also the dearth of
heavyweight surrogates he can call his own.
</P>
<P>
   His wife Tipper, daughter, Karenna and Army buddy Bob Delabar
are about the only people campaigning for Gore who are not
acquainted with him by virtue of the fact that he was selected by
Bill Clinton as his running mate in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The scarcity of policy advisers on Gore's campaign payroll
(there are basically two) is evident when the likes of
Environmental Protection Agency chief Carol Browner, Education
Secretary Richard Riley and National Economic Council chairman Gene
Sperling tag along with Gore to brief reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Clinton-Gore administration is very much like an extended
family. Gore's been an integral part of this administration and has
great relationships with people at virtually every level of this
administration,'' said campaign spokesman Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see that as a tremendous asset. The American people clearly
want to continue with the policies of this administration.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, then-Vice President George Bush used Ronald Reagan's
Cabinet in the same way, enlisting them on the day that Housing
Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. handed out campaign neckties during
a Cabinet meeting and announced, ''Guys, it's now time to get on
board and push for Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the younger Bush, Gore's use of surrogates so directly
tied to the president fits the twin arguments that electing Gore
would be like giving Clinton a third term, and that Gore has no
core of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes it's hard to know who Al Gore is and what he really
believes in. To the degree he attaches himself to President Clinton
then detaches himself, it compounds his problem,'' said Bush
campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer. ''There doesn't seem to be a
strong guiding philosophy other than the political
play-of-the-moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush partisans also bristle at the built-in advantage Gore's
well-placed allies give him.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Bush charged the Education Department with spending
taxpayer dollars to campaign against him and Riley said his words
had been manipulated by Bush for political gain.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Fleischer suggested that all the political
activity in service to Gore had put government business on hold.
</P>
<P>
   ''With so much more that we can get done this year, like saving
Social Security, reforming Medicare and improving education, the
(Cabinet secretaries') time would be better spent solving the
nation's problems than engaging in attack partisan politics on
behalf of Al Gore,'' Fleischer said.

<HEADLINE> Cunningham Schooled in Cowboys Lore  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Randall Cunningham has played against the
Dallas Cowboys enough times that he knows all about his new team's
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Having a star on the side of my helmet, America's Team, God's
team -- all that good stuff,'' Cunningham said. ''You've got the
hole in the stadium so God can watch his team; I like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham joined his former rivals in person Monday for the
start of a three-day minicamp, the last get-together before
training camp begins July 17.
</P>
<P>
   He signed a three-year deal to back up Troy Aikman last week.
Aikman greeted Cunningham with a hug and welcomed him to the team.
</P>
<P>
   ''He brings us stability at that position,'' Aikman said.
''Randall has won a lot of games in this league. If he's called on
to play, he's a guy the team can count on.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, a plodding runner, joked that there could be other
benefits of having the top-rushing quarterback in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure there's a lot of people hoping that maybe he can
teach me how to run around back there in the pocket,'' Aikman said.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham has played 14 seasons in Philadelphia and Minnesota.
The Vikings released him June 2, making way for Daunte Culpepper to
be their starter.
</P>
<P>
   Had starting been the most important thing to 37-year-old
Cunningham, he could've gone to Detroit to replace the injured
Charlie Batch or Tampa Bay to push second-year quarterback Shaun
King.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just like to know where I'm at,'' he said. ''I went in as a
backup in Minnesota, but I knew my role. So I was able to accept
it. It's the same thing here.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham is a bit behind the curve in learning the
timing-based system the Cowboys are installing. Quarterbacks coach
Wade Wilson tried giving him a head start by sending him the
playbook last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''My head is spinning a little bit,'' said Cunningham, who spent
the lunch hour sitting at his locker with his playbook on his lap,
highlighting play names and passing routes. ''There's so much to
learn in this offense. Now I know why I signed a three-year deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dave Campo is thrilled to have Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt this was an opportunity to get a guy who is a change
of pace, who can do some things with the football himself under
certain circumstances,'' Campo said. ''He's going to be part of our
offensive scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham's most famous play against the Cowboys was in 1987,
when Eagles coach Buddy Ryan had him fake a kneel-down and throw a
touchdown pass, making a Philadelphia victory even more lopsided.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yeah, yeah, I still hear about that,'' Cunningham said. ''It's
been mentioned a few times.''

<HEADLINE> Hill May Not Play on Olympic Team  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Looks like Grant Hill won't make it to
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although we don't have final word, I think there's a real
chance unfortunately that (Hill) might not be able to play,'' USA
Basketball president Russ Granik said Monday. ''It may be necessary
that we're going to have to find one replacement. We'll try to do
it as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill broke his left ankle late in the season and had a pin
surgically inserted after the Detroit Pistons were swept by the
Miami Heat in the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   When Hill was selected for one of the final three spots, team
officials said they wanted to add a player with slashing,
ballhandling and scoring skills -- all qualities embodied by Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ''My guess is the committee would look at players who have
similar skills,'' Granik said. ''There's lot of possibilities at
that kind of position. One who has sprained his ankle here (Kobe
Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers) is a possibility, (Charlotte's)
Eddie Jones is a possibility. At that position there are a lot of
great players.''
</P>
<P>
   Absent from Granik's short list was another of the league's top
small forwards, Jalen Rose of the Indiana Pacers, who was not
surprised to hear he was omitted.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to throw his name into the mix, Rose hinted the spot
should go to the player who emerges victorious from the
Lakers-Pacers championship series.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we're going to talk about that position, I like my stats
and the things I've done for my team as much as any (small forward)
in the league,'' Rose said. ''Of course I would love to play on the
Olympic team. I was circling 2004, but 2000 ain't gone yet. If
they're going to call, I'll give you my number.''
</P>
<P>
   The USA Basketball selection committee plans to discuss Hill's
status and possibly choose a replacement before the end of the
month.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Duncan of the San Antonio Spurs is recovering from a knee
injury that kept him out of the playoffs. Granik said he was
optimistic Duncan would be ready in time.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reports we get are fairly optimistic that he's rehabbing
well and he really wants to play if at all possible. On that one
we're going to wait a while and see what can happen, because we
certainly would like Tim to play,'' Granik said.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said he wasn't worried about the Olympic team, instead
focusing on healing his sprained ankle in time for Game 4 of the
finals on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal, who has already turned down an
invitation to join the team, said he would ''probably'' not change
his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they should give somebody else a shot. I have two gold
medals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the U.S. team includes Alonzo Mourning, Vin Baker,
Jason Kidd, Tim Hardaway, Steve Smith, Allan Houston, Gary Payton,
Ray Allen, Vince Carter and Kevin Garnett.

<HEADLINE> 49ers' QB Steve Young Retires  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- It took Steve Young months to finally
decide to give up football. Once he made his mind up, the rest was
easy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do I want to keep playing? Absolutely,'' Young said after
announcing his retirement Monday, ending a 15-year NFL career
highlighted by 13 seasons with the San Francisco 49ers, the team he
took to a 1995 Super Bowl title.
</P>
<P>
   ''But is it the right time to retire? Yes. I don't want people
to think I'm forlorn about this. On the way here with my family,
all of us were laughing. This is a celebration for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, 38, whose plans to leave football became known late last
week, made one final trip to the locker room at the 49ers' Santa
Clara headquarters to formalize his retirement in front of an
audience of family, friends, teammates and coaches. He played his
final game last Sept. 27 in Arizona, where a violent hit left him
with his fourth concussion in three years.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of the locker room for his farewell to football was
deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the secrets of my success has always been I show up for
work every day and I give it all I've got,'' Young said. ''This is
where I showed up for work. I guess I wanted to show up for work
one more day.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Young said he viewed retirement as a beginning,
not an ending.
</P>
<P>
   Young was married last spring to Barbara Graham and the couple
is expecting a baby in December. He said he's now dedicating
himself to being ''the best father and husband I can be.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted he is the CEO of a fledgling high-tech firm that
employs some 120 people in San Francisco, has entered into a
business partnership with friend and former teammate Brent Jones on
a Silicon Valley startup, and also oversees a variety of charity
work through his Forever Young Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Also a lawyer, Young plans to start a public interest law firm
to help disadvantaged families.
</P>
<P>
   ''In many ways, what lies ahead for me is maybe more important
than what I leave behind,'' Young said. ''The talent and skills
that I have gleaned from football hopefully will enable me to help
others pursue similar dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   The retirement news conference comes nearly nine months after
Young took the devastating hit that left him unconscious on the
turf with his fourth concussion in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, the seven-time Pro Bowler used his fearlessness,
scrambling ability and passing accuracy to win two league MVP
Awards. He also was the Super Bowl MVP in leading the 49ers to a
49-26 win over San Diego in the 1995 championship game. He won two
other Super Bowl rings as a backup to Joe Montana and holds six
passing titles.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who leaves as the NFL's highest-rated passer, followed
one of the toughest acts in league history when he took over in
1991 for Hall of Famer Montana. Young said the competition between
the two helped them both.
</P>
<P>
   ''For me to watch one of the greats, I was energized by that and
grateful for it,'' he said. ''It was the finishing school for me in
quarterbacking. In all my years, I just wanted to live up to the
standard that had been set.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had any advice for his successor, Jeff Garcia, Young
quipped, ''Fake it till you make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Young is the latest sports superstar to retire in the last two
years, from Michael Jordan to Wayne Gretzky to John Elway to Dan
Marino. While their departures set off similar emotions, the formal
farewells took place in larger, grander settings.
</P>
<P>
   Young popped through a black curtain, walking from the team's
showers to a podium to declare he was leaving the game he had
played for nearly 31 years -- 17 as a professional. He spent two
years in the USFL and two with Tampa Bay before coming to San
Francisco in 1987 in a trade pulled off by Bill Walsh, the Niners'
coach then and now the general manager.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to coaches, players and relatives, guests at the
announcement included former 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo, who
turned over control of the team to his sister to help resolve a
family feud, and Cleveland Browns president Carmen Policy, who left
San Francisco after a falling out with DeBartolo.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Rice, who teamed with Young in one of the most successful
quarterback-receiver partnerships, spoke of ''great chemistry and a
great relationship.'' The two formed the most prolific
touchdown-pass tandem in history, hooking up 85 times for scores.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old receiver said he struggled over what to say
because, ''I know the clock is ticking for me also.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco coach Steve Mariucci presented Young with one of
his game jerseys and told him: ''We love everything about you, what
you've done and who you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Young's decision to retire followed months of agonized debate --
with himself and the 49ers organization. Given his history of
concussions, no one wanted to risk a permanent injury.
</P>
<P>
   Young's primary neurologist is believed to have told him last
year to quit football. But Young still yearned to play and passed
neurological tests showing he was clinically ''normal.''
</P>
<P>
   The salary-cap stressed 49ers, fearing the potential for
re-injury and wary of the payroll implications if they brought
Young back, urged retirement. Young briefly considered going to
Denver for one last shot at a Super Bowl run, but ultimately
determined to finish as a 49er.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fire still burns, but not enough for the stakes,'' Young
said. ''The truth is there is plenty of football left in me. But I
have done what I set out to do and I think that is what settled on
me the last couple weeks. I have attained all the goals and even
more than I could have ever dreamed of.''
</P>
<P>
   Young's career highlights include the Jan. 3, 1999 playoff game
when he hooked up with Terrell Owens on a last-second 25-yard
touchdown pass to beat Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Equally dangerous as a runner, he rushed for an NFL-record 43
touchdowns, including a remarkable 49-yard scramble in 1988 against
Minnesota that endures as one of the great broken-field runs.
</P>
<P>
   He threw for a record six touchdowns in San Francisco's 49-26
Super Bowl win over San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Young said he will miss the team he had played with for nearly
half a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ''I loved playing Dallas. I loved playing Green Bay,'' he said.
''I loved the expectation that every year we were going to the
Super Bowl.''

<HEADLINE> Seminoles Stay Alive in Title Hunt  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Florida State's Ryan Barthelemy already is in
pretty good company atop the College World Series home run list.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a more special group he'd like to join -- those with
a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   It still could happen. Barthelemy tied former Seminoles star
J.D. Drew with five CWS home runs Monday night and Mike Ziegler
pitched a five-hitter as Florida State staved off elimination with
a 6-2 victory over Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mike Ziegler was the driving force for Florida State,'' Texas
coach Augie Garrido said. ''He didn't walk anybody, he didn't hit
anybody and they didn't make any errors for a while. That takes a
lot of our game away right there. They were able to dominate
because they played very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles (52-18) face Southern California tonight in
another elimination game. Right-handed Jon McDonald will start for
Florida State, and the Seminoles can only hope for a performance
similar to Ziegler's.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the Mike Ziegler show,'' FSU coach Mike Martin said.
''It was a tremendous display of pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Ziegler (10-4) retired 15 of the final 17 batters. He had sat
down 13 consecutive Texas hitters before Matt Rosenberg singled
with one out in the ninth. Two batters later, Tommy Nicholson
doubled, scoring Rosenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson had two hits for the Longhorns (46-21).
</P>
<P>
   ''He was just ahead of us all night and kept us off-balance
enough to make us not effective,'' Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
   Ziegler struck out five without a walk.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is what college baseball is all about, winning at the
College World Series,'' said Ziegler, a junior college transfer
from Tallahassee Community College.
</P>
<P>
   He was drafted in the 14th round by Oakland. Now, Martin is
looking for a way to keep him at Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've offered him my car, but he thinks he can get more,''
Martin joked. ''This is probably his last year at Florida State.''
</P>
<P>
   Barthelemy, who went 4-for-4 with two homers and three RBIs in
the Seminoles' opening loss to Southern California, made it 6-1 in
the eighth with a two-run homer, his 13th of the season and fifth
at Rosenblatt Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just great to be mentioned in the same sentence as him,''
Barthelemy said of tying Drew's mark.
</P>
<P>
LSU 10, Southern California 4
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana State's Brad Cresse, the Tigers' leading hitter, is
0-for-6 with five strikeouts. LSU hasn't really missed him. Brad
Hawpe hasn't let them.
</P>
<P>
   Hawpe, who hits cleanup behind Cresse, had two three-run homers
as LSU snapped the Trojans' 16-game winning streak. The Tigers are
one victory from advancing to the CWS championship game for the
fifth time.
</P>
<P>
   With the Tigers trailing 3-0 in the sixth with just two hits off
USC starter Mark Prior (10-7), Hawpe drove a pitch high over the
bleachers in right-center to tie it 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had thrown a lot of changeups to lefthanders. I just went
out there looking for it,'' Hawpe said. ''Sooner or later he was
bound to leave one up over the plate. He did and I got a hold of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   LSU (50-17) has won 11 straight games and remains the only
unbeaten team in the postseason. In two CWS games the Tigers have
scored 23 runs and hit five home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Prior took a no-hitter into the sixth inning. It was broken up
by Ryan Theriot, who scored three times and drove in three runs for
the Tigers, who have won four national titles in the five times
they have opened the CWS 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Trey Hodges (4-2) allowed two runs and four hits in relief of
Ben Saxson, who left in the fourth inning with a blister on his
right middle finger.
</P>
<P>
   Southern California (44-19), which has won 12 national titles,
is no stranger to the losers' bracket. In two previous trips under
coach Mike Gillespie, the Trojans lost their CWS openers, but went
on to the national championship game both times. In 1998, USC lost
to LSU in the opener and had to beat the Tigers twice to advance to
the title game, which they won for the first time in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're in better shape than we were two years ago,''
USC shortstop Seth Davidson said. ''By playing them today, we know
what they're all about.''

<HEADLINE> NYC crowd cheers Springsteen's Diallo song  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Caught in another political storm over his
lyrics, Bruce Springsteen responded by letting his music do the
talking.
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen performed for the second time publicly a song about
the New York City police killing of Amadou Diallo, despite angry
police union leaders urging their members to boycott his Madison
Square Garden concert.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey rocker on Monday made no introduction and offered
no explanation of his thoughts on the song.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, band members began the song by approaching microphones
one by one and repeating the words ''41 shots,'' referring to the
number of times four white officers shot at Diallo, a black West
African immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd began cheering in recognition of the song and
interrupted Springsteen's singing with cheers several times. It was
difficult to distinguish any boos from the traditional ''Bruce''
chant at his shows.
</P>
<P>
   One heckler was escorted from the Garden after he approached the
stage and flashed obscene hand gestures at Springsteen during the
song.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is this your wallet? Is this your life?'' the song goes,
referring to Diallo's wallet, which police mistook for a gun. ''You
can get killed just for living in your American skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen introduced the song last week during a concert in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A family friend said Diallo's parents planned to attend the
concert to thank Springsteen for the song. Their presence could not
be immediately confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Saikou and Kadiatou Diallo also planned to invite Springsteen to
visit with the city's black community, said the friend, who
declined to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years ago, Springsteen was upset when his song ''Born in
the USA'' was used in President Reagan's political campaign and was
misinterpreted as a patriotic anthem.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo, 22, was mortally wounded as he stood in the vestibule of
his Bronx home on Feb. 4, 1999. The four officers involved in the
shooting were acquitted of murder earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, which represents 27,000
city police officers, has urged its members not to attend or work
overtime security detail at Springsteen's Garden concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Police Lt. Eric Adams, of 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who
Care, said his group supports Springsteen and is upset that few
black artists have used their talents to support the Diallo family.
</P>
<P>
   ''We commend Bruce Springsteen, and we believe that he is
courageous in the position that he is taking,'' Adams said in a
news conference before the concert.
</P>
<P>
   Although Springsteen's 10-night New York City stand was bringing
his yearlong nostalgic tour with the E Street Band to an end, the
rocker was clearly thinking of the future. Besides ''American Skin
(41 Shots),'' he opened his concert with another new song, a
clenched-fist rocker called ''Code of Silence.''
</P>
<P>
   He also rendered two of his best-known songs almost
unrecognizable. ''Dancing in the Dark'' was turned into an acoustic
country tune, and the melody to ''Born in the USA'' was revamped
with a slide guitar accompaniment.

<HEADLINE> Scouts suing state over payroll deduction snub  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) - The Boy Scouts of America have filed a
federal lawsuit against the state's comptroller and the Connecticut
State Employee Campaign Committee, claiming the group was
discriminated against when it was removed from a list of charities
eligible for state payroll deductions.
</P>
<P>
   The state Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities
unanimously ruled last month the Boy Scouts cannot be included on a
list of charities that get money from state payroll deductions
because the group's policy against homosexuals violates state
discrimination laws.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Bridgeport Monday,
asks Judge Warren Eginton to order the state to return the
organization to the list. The judge is expected to conduct a
hearing on the issue on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut State Employees' Campaign for Charitable Giving
had asked the CHRO for a ruling in November after the New Jersey
Supreme Court found the Boy Scouts policy banning gays was
unconstitutional. The Boy Scouts argued they have freedom of
association under the Constitution's First Amendment and appealed.
The New Jersey case is now before the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   State Comptroller Nancy Wyman said the lawsuit was expected,
''...and now it will be up to the courts to decide the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The state employees' campaign hires the United Way to collect
the employee deductions. But the state has the right to prevent the
fund-raiser from giving the Boy Scouts any employee paycheck
contributions not designated for a particular agency.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the campaign raised $1.3 million for more than 800
charities.
</P>
<P>
   The Scouts are scheduled to challenge their removal from the
list during a hearing before the state employee contribution
committee at United Way offices in Rocky Hill Tuesday at noon.
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts' lawsuit points out the state employee charitable
campaign list ''includes numerous organizations which limit or
preferentially offer services on the basis of age like Services for
the Elderly of Farmington, ethnicity like the National Black Child
Development Institute and religious groups like Catholics for a
Free Choice.
</P>
<P>
   Boy Scouts' lawyer George Davidson said the ''selective
targeting of the Boy Scouts for exclusion based on their dislike of
the Boy Scouts' message is unconstitutional.''

<HEADLINE> New Pebble Beach, Same U.S. Open  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- The last time Matt Gogel was walking
the fairways of Pebble Beach, he watched a seven-stroke lead
disappear on the back nine as Tiger Woods stormed to his sixth
straight PGA Tour victory.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't even on Gogel's mind Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This might not even be the same golf course,'' Gogel said
after a practice round on a breezy, sunny day that featured thick
rough, tight fairways and hard, fast greens.
</P>
<P>
   Pebble Beach takes on a new look when the U.S. Open comes to
town, and not just because Tommy Smothers is not around to do yo-yo
tricks.
</P>
<P>
   They call the U.S. Open the toughest test in golf for a reason.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the kind of golf course, the way it's set up, where
you have to put the ball on the fairway and put the ball on the
green,'' Jack Nicklaus said after his practice round Monday. ''If
you do that .... well, you're not going to do that. It's going to
be a difficult golf course to get the ball up and down.''
</P>
<P>
   The second hole, a generous par-5 that routinely yielded birdies
in the past three U.S. Opens at Pebble Beach, is now playing as a
484-yard par-4.
</P>
<P>
   Rough that was supposed to be a nuisance has become nasty,
leveled off at 4 inches and capable of making balls sink to the
bottom. If that wasn't enough, Nicklaus winced when he saw workers
watering the rough late in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's long, it's gnarly, it's thick,'' Nicklaus said. ''I
thought they might take water off so we could have half a chance to
play a reasonable shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Compounding matters are the greens, which already were rolling
at 11 on the Stimpmeter. They never got beyond 11 all week at
Pinehurst No. 2 in last year's U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows what awaits when the shots actually count on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It all depends on the weather,'' said two-time Masters
champion Jose Maria Olazabal. ''If the wind blows, the conditions
will be quite severe. You don't need a really strong wind here to
make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The rough -- and the small greens -- take care of the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The USGA talked all year about how the rough would be minimal,
similar to the 3 inches at Pinehurst No. 2 for last year's
championship. But three weeks ago, USGA director of rules and
competition Tom Meeks was tossing balls into the high grass and
noticed too many of them sitting up, as if on tees, because of the
dense Rye grass.
</P>
<P>
   By adding an extra inch, the ball will sink deeper into the
grass and make the players think twice about trying to reach the
green.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're going to see different options,'' he said. ''The last
thing we want is to have them hitting sand wedge out of the rough.
Sometimes, that's all they can do. But we want to see them have
more than one option to play the shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The best option is to not miss fairways and greens, which is no
small task.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know who's leading the PGA Tour in greens in
regulation, but whatever that average is, it's going to be down
after this week,'' Meeks said. ''These greens are so small. Someone
who hits 10 or 12 greens, they should come up with a pretty good
round.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeks wouldn't predict a winning score.
</P>
<P>
   The lowest winning score in Open history at Pebble Beach was 282
by Tom Watson in 1982. The lowest score in relation to par in Open
history anywhere is 8-under 272 by Lee Janzen and Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 at Pebble Beach, Gil Morgan got to 12 under in the third
round before a collapse -- he had a 77-81 on the weekend and
finished at 5-over 293.
</P>
<P>
   Meeks only promised consistency -- at least on his part.
</P>
<P>
   ''If after Thursday we've got 25 guys at 4 under, we're not
going to change the course on Friday,'' he said. ''And if the low
score is 4 over, we're not going to do anything to change that,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   The wind, however, can have a mind of its own. And that's one
aspect of Pebble Beach that never seems to change.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 7, Padres 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Mark McGwire hit a towering two-run homer that
broke a seventh-inning tie, and a controversial ruling helped the
St. Louis Cardinals score two runs Monday night in a 7-3 victory
over the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's 23rd homer, his second in two days, landed an
estimated 451 feet into the second deck in left field. The home run
off Matt Clement (5-6) followed a leadoff walk to Jim Edmonds, his
third of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday, McGwire had just one homer since May 24. Monday's
drive was his 545th, moving him within three of Mike Schmidt for
seventh place on the career list.
</P>
<P>
   Since joining the Cardinals, McGwire has eight homers in 12
games at San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Benes (6-3) allowed three runs and six hits in six innings,
and struck out a season-high 10 against his former team.
</P>
<P>
   Clement allowed five runs -- four earned -- seven hits, six walks
and a hit batter in six-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis scored two runs in the sixth to take a 3-2 lead on a
controversial ruling by plate umpire Gary Cederstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Matheny led off with a double and Placido Polanco followed
with a slow roller up the middle that was gloved by second baseman
Bret Boone. As Matheny turned at third base, Boone threw behind him
and the ball bounced past Phil Nevin, caromed off a wall in foul
territory and rolled toward the Cardinals dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Clement picked up the ball as it hit a pile of gloves on a towel
in the dirt in front of the dugout. Cederstrom apparently ruled the
ball went out of play, allowing Matheny to score and Polanco to
take third.
</P>
<P>
   After a lengthy argument, San Diego manager Bruce Bochy played
the game under protest. Fernando Vina followed with a sacrifice fly
for a 3-2 lead, but Ryan Klesko homered in the bottom half.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Owens hit a two-run double for San Diego, and Thomas
Howard's RBI single drove in the Cardinals' first run.
</P>
<P>
   Matheny hit a two-run homer off Carlos Reyes in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Clement has 22 walks in his last four starts. ... San Diego
C Carlos Hernandez was a late scratch because of lower-back
tightness. ... St. Louis OF Ray Lankford was held out of the
lineup, one day after he sprained his right hand while striking out
against Detroit. Lankford, the DH against the Tigers, has not
started in the field since June 3 due to a sore left hamstring. ...
Padre OF Tony Gwynn (degenerative left knee) did not start in right
field as part of his routine of not playing back-to-back games.

<HEADLINE> World Leaders Mourn Hafez Assad  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA BRYSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Mournful Koranic verses wailed from
mosque speakers and the muffled beating of funeral drums filled the
streets Tuesday as world dignitaries and ordinary Syrians alike
paid tribute to Syrian President Hafez Assad, one of the Middle
East's most enduring and enigmatic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Daylong funeral ceremonies began with pallbearers in camouflage
fatigues and scarlet berets carrying the president's flag-draped
casket from his Damascus home toward a hillside palace compound.
The frenzy of mourning was to stretch from the capital to Syria's
northern hills, where Assad rode donkeys and gathered fruit as a
boy.
</P>
<P>
   Mourners thronged Damascus, many carrying large photos of Assad,
who died Saturday at age 69 after three decades of autocratic rule.
At the head of the funeral procession, soldiers from the
presidential guard clasped enormous wreaths of white flowers and
red ribbons.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad, the late leader's son and heir apparent, walked
behind the casket, clad in a dark suit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today, the nation bids farewell to its leader,'' headlined the
Tishreen newspaper. The front page of the Al-Thawraa newspaper was
filled by a huge black-bordered portrait of Assad.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak were among the world leaders coming to pay homage to
a man with whom they sometimes clashed but nonetheless acknowledged
as a powerful shaper of regional politics.
</P>
<P>
   The United States listed Assad's Syria as a sponsor of
terrorism, criticized its human rights record and was frustrated at
delays in the Israeli-Syrian peace talks it tried to mediate. But
Monday, as Albright prepared to head to Syria for the funeral, she
said: ''I think that it's totally appropriate that we pay our
respects to a historic figure and that we express our condolences
to the people of Syria.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the national outpouring of grief, Syria's leadership lined
up behind Bashar Assad as the choice to succeed his father, with
the parliament speaker on Monday declaring Bashar as capable as the
late president.
</P>
<P>
   But in an almost Shakespearean twist, a new threat emerged from
within the Assad family. Rifaat Assad -- the younger brother of the
late president, who has been in exile in Europe since attempting to
seize power in 1983 -- made his own claim to the presidency just one
day before Hafez Assad was to be buried.
</P>
<P>
   In the first open challenge to what has otherwise been a smooth
transition, Rifaat Assad promised a ''corrective movement'' in
Syria -- borrowing a term used to refer to Hafez Assad's coup in
1970. The statement to the Syrian people was read Monday night by
an announcer on Arab News Network, a London-based satellite
television station owned by Rifaat's son Sawmar.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, Rifaat said through a spokesman that he planned
to return to Damascus at the ''appropriate time'' to contest his
nephew's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ''He (Rifaat) represents legitimacy in Syria,'' Rifaat Assad's
spokesman Al-Hareth Al-Khair said, adding that ''the people and the
army ... are with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Khair appeared to be exaggerating the extent of Rifaat's
following in Syria. He enjoyed considerable popularity at the time
of his work alongside his elder brother, but his long years in
exile and the removal of his supporters in the army and the ruling
Baath party renders him a spent political force.
</P>
<P>
   The army has already publicly pledged its backing for Bashar and
he has been nominated to the office of president by the leadership
of the Baath party. It was the tribute his father, who had groomed
him for succession, might have wanted more than any other.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker of the People's Assembly, Abdul-Qader Qadoura,
heaped lavish praise for Bashar Assad's abilities Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mission of defending and loving the nation is not linked
to a man's age,'' he told a news conference. ''We believe that
every citizen in Syria who is capable of giving should be allowed
to give regardless of his age.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, though, the focus was on the late president more
than his successor.
</P>
<P>
   For Syrians, the loss of the only president many had ever known
sparked a remarkable outpouring of grief that at times seemed
staged, at other times almost unbearably heartfelt. They took to
the streets of cities and villages by the tens of thousands,
chanting praise for Assad and for Bashar.
</P>
<P>
   Young men bared their chests and, in a gesture characteristic of
Shiite Islam, ripped at their flesh with knives. Women draped in
black fainted in the hot, humid weather in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   ''You are our leader forever!'' some shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Some Syrians spent the night along the cortege route. Others
headed out early in the morning, dressed in black, walking in
groups, silent except for the padding of their feet. Houses and
cars throughout the country were draped in black cloth and huge
portraits of the late president and his sons.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's funeral schedule included an opportunity for foreign
dignitaries to pay their respects at al-Shaab Palace, or the
People's Palace, in Damascus. Ordinary Syrians were given a chance
to take part, with the funeral procession pausing at a public
square on the journey from Assad's private home to al-Shaab.
</P>
<P>
   The last stop after a flight from Damascus was Qardaha, Assad's
hometown and the burial place of his eldest son and first choice as
successor, Basil. The family grave at Qardaha, some 200 miles north
of Damascus, is dominated by the huge marble mausoleum of Basil
Assad, who died in a 1994 car crash.

Gore Opposes Execution Moratorium
</SUBHEAD>

   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Al Gore supports DNA testing where he says it can make
the justice system ''more accurate and fair,'' but does not favor a moratorium
on federal executions. Questioned about the issue during a televised women's
forum Monday night, Gore, who supports capital punishment, referred to Illinois,
where the Gov. George Ryan earlier this year suspended executions after 13 death
row inmates were exonerated. The vice president said he supports DNA testing
where it can improve the administration of justice and that if such testing in
another state led to the kind of record uncovered in Illinois ''it would in my
view justify a moratorium as in Illinois.''

HMOs, which are based on financial incentives, the court said. In another

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Refugees Polled  </HEADLINE>
By DANA BUDEIRI
<TEXT>
<P>
   DHEISHEH REFUGEE CAMP, West Bank (AP) -- Pollsters recently
entered Falah Saed's cramped grocery shop and asked him to fill out
a questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
   Did he insist on returning to his home village in what is now
Israel or would he accept compensation for staying put? He
emphatically marked the first choice.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want the homeland ... nothing but the homeland,'' said the
85-year-old, seated behind a rickety wooden counter.
</P>
<P>
   Like Saed, many Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and
neighboring Arab states were asked to answer questions about
possible solutions to the Palestinian refugee problem. There are
about 3.6 million Palestinian refugees, most living in the
Palestinian areas, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The survey on refugees was part of a larger project by the
Palestinian Authority's State Information Service to gauge public
opinion on the key issues in peace treaty talks with Israel.
Negotiations are entering a critical phase, with a treaty due by
September.
</P>
<P>
   The results could guide Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat by
determining to what extent concessions are acceptable to the
Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
   If a majority of refugees rejects compensation and resettlement
in exile, for example, as preliminary results indicate, Arafat
could more effectively block compromise by referring to hardline
public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The results ''will show Israel and the world that the
Palestinian refugees reject all solutions except that of their
return,'' said Arafat adviser Nabil Amr.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has said it would not allow Palestinian refugees to
return to its territory, but would try to work out a compensation
and repatriation scheme with the help of the international
community.
</P>
<P>
   Some Palestinians warned that the survey opened the door to a
dangerous debate by even raising options other than a return to the
land from which refugees fled or where expelled during the 1948
Mideast war over Israel's creation.
</P>
<P>
   Khaled Zakout, a teacher at a U.N.-run school in the refugee
camp of Dheisheh, just south of Jerusalem, said he tore up the
questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
   ''Options other than the right of return should not be brought
up. This is dangerous,'' Zakout said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ghassan Khader, a 27-year-old university student from
the Balata refugee camp near the West Bank town of Nablus, said it
was good the refugees were being heard ''because these are fateful
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Riad Hassan, director of the State Information Service, would
not talk about methodology of the survey, including whether a
representative sample of refugees was selected. But he said 1,400
questionnaires were distributed in the West Bank alone.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents were asked to comment on a variety of options, such
as being repatriated to a town other than their original village or
city, or obtaining Israeli identity cards. Hassan's office
regularly conducts polls for the Palestinian leadership, though he
said Arafat did not specifically request this query.
</P>
<P>
   The results have not yet been published. However, Hassan and
field workers involved in the survey said most refugees insisted on
returning to their homes and turned down compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat should carefully study public opinion, said Fathi Samour,
a Dheisheh teacher. ''The intifadeh erupted out of nowhere,'' said
Samour, referring to the 1987-93 Palestinian uprising against the
Israeli occupation. ''It can happen again.''

<HEADLINE> Soldier Suicides Are on the Rise  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Using the Air Force as a model, the Pentagon
is rallying the military services to strengthen and improve their
approach to preventing suicide, the second-leading cause of death
among troops.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has managed to lower its suicide rate to 5.6 per
100,000 members of the active-duty force from 15.2 just four years
ago. The Air Force's rate now is about half that of the military as
a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pentagon statistics do not show any general increase in
suicides, officials are developing a more streamlined, standardized
policy on suicide prevention they hope will emulate the Air Force's
success.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force puts special emphasis on encouraging troubled
individuals to seek mental health help. It also created a ''buddy''
system in which a service member who recognizes a potential suicide
knows how and where to refer the person for professional help.
Another key to the Air Force approach is minimizing the stigma that
normally is attached to a military member who admits to a mental
health problem.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the apparent payoff from this approach, experts say it
is too early to say for sure what accounts for the reduced
suicides.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are two questions: Why, and can they sustain it?'' said
Navy Capt. Frances Stewart of the Pentagon's health affairs office.
</P>
<P>
   The Army is trying to match the Air Force's success, in part by
attacking the stigma problem. Gen. Eric K. Shinseki, the Army chief
of staff, has issued an unusually public call for commanders to
take the offensive against the suicide problem. He wants to get the
word out that erasing the stigma is a high priority.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a serious problem with suicides,'' Shinseki wrote in a
message published in the latest issue of Soldiers, an Army
magazine. Calling the matter urgent, he said, ''We must take better
care of our people.''
</P>
<P>
   Suicide rates for the military as a whole have held relatively
steady in recent years, although the Army says its suicide rate has
gone up the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   In the first five days of 2000, the Army had four suspected
suicides, Shinseki said.
</P>
<P>
   The Army last year had 65 confirmed suicides and 12 deaths
suspected to be suicides, a rate of 15.5 suicides per 100,000
soldiers. That rate climbed for the second year in a row and is the
highest among the services; only twice before over the past two
decades was the Army's rate higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps last year had a rate of 15 suicides per 100,000
service members, the Navy's was 11 and the Air Force was at 5.6.
</P>
<P>
   The actual number of military suicides may not seem large,
considering that the active-duty force now stands at 1.3 million.
But suicides over the past 10 years have been the second-leading
cause of death, after accidents.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, about 10 times as many troops have died at
their own hand as from hostile fire.
</P>
<P>
   Although official statistics on suicides among the general U.S.
population are not directly comparable to the military, the
civilian suicide rate for white males in their 20s -- the
predominant group in the military -- was about 24 per 100,000 in
1997. That is about twice the rate for the military.
</P>
<P>
   Statistically, the typical military suicide is committed by a
white male in his 20s, in the upper levels of the enlisted ranks.
Frequently the person has suffered a recent breakup of a marriage
or other close personal relationship, and often alcohol or personal
financial problems are involved.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon-sponsored study in 1997, triggered by the shocking
suicide of the Navy's top officer, Adm. Mike Boorda in May 1996,
said it was not clear whether life in the military carries unique
risks of suicide. Indeed suicide rates in the military
traditionally have been slightly lower than in the civilian
population.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some aspects of the military culture may
inhibit some who need help from seeking it, according to Dr. John
F. Mazzuchi, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for clinical
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The military is a macho institution,'' he said in an
interview. ''There is the perception that if I let them know I'm
weak they won't want me around.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that stigma which the Army hopes to eliminate.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be effective, you must be willing to stand before your
soldiers and tell them with sincerity that it takes a strong,
courageous person to admit to having emotional problems and seek
help for suicidal feelings,'' the Army says in a new booklet,
''Suicide Prevention: Could I Have Done More?''

<HEADLINE> Gov't To Compensate Nixon Estate  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After 20 years of hotly contested litigation,
the government has agreed to pay Richard Nixon's estate $18 million
for his presidential papers and reel after reel -- 3,700 hours worth
-- of secretly recorded tape it seized when he resigned in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a fair resolution for the American taxpayer,'' David
Ogden, acting assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice
Department's civil division, said after the settlement was signed
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The amount was far more than the government's offer, but far
less than what the estate had sought.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers argued against paying anything, but said if
compensation must be made, it should be no more than $2.2 million.
The Nixon camp estimated the fair market value of the materials at
up to $35 million. Tacking on 25 years of interest brought the
asking price to more than $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that it's pretty clear the government won,'' said John
Dean, the Nixon White House counsel who testified in 1973 about the
Watergate scandal -- burglaries, wiretapping, violations of campaign
finance laws and attempts to use government agencies to harm
political opponents that forced his one-time boss out of office.
''It sounds to me like they got about what the government thought
was a fair shake for the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   In a settlement, neither side wins, said Scott Nelson, one
attorney for the Nixon estate.
</P>
<P>
   ''My understanding is that this particular number was close to
the top of what the government considered fair, and close to the
bottom of what we considered fair, but we both considered it
fair,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The case began in 1980. After Nixon resigned, Congress passed a
law confiscating his materials. Six years later, Nixon sued for
compensation. The estate took up the lawsuit after Nixon died April
22, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, a court ruled that Nixon was entitled to nothing. But
in 1992 a federal appeals court ruled that he was entitled to be
paid the fair value of the seized materials. A second trial, heard
by U.S. District Judge John Garrett Penn, was conducted to set a
figure.
</P>
<P>
   For five months, the judge heard conflicting evidence from
historians, archivists and appraisers about the value of the papers
and tapes -- some so scatchy that barely a word was audible.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore the material's historical value, an attorney for
the estate replayed a video of Nixon making his resignation speech.
The teary-eyed president's words to the nation on Aug. 8, 1974,
broke the silence in the courtroom: ''I have never been a quitter.
To leave office before my term is complete is abhorrent to every
instinct in my body. ... Therefore I shall resign the presidency
effective at noon tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Drafts and the final version Nixon read from would have sold for
$200,000 to $300,000, according to appraisers hired by the estate.
They valued Nixon's tape recordings at $12 million and priced
papers on which the president scribbled his personal goals at
$20,000. Even tapes containing Nixon's embarrassing ethnic slurs
would have been valuable, they said.
</P>
<P>
   For the government, Justice Department attorney Neil Koslowe
argued that since many of the most important papers involve
Watergate and the cover-up, compensation for records about
presidential criminality would ''convert a national legacy into a
national embarrassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's settlement came as the federal judge was still deciding
how much, if anything, the government should pay.
</P>
<P>
   ''A litigator always will wonder what would have happened had we
continued to litigate,'' Nelson said. ''But I think it's in the
best interest of the clients and the government to come to a
resolution, rather than for both sides to take their chances'' with
a judicial decision.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the Nixon estate estimated that the Nixon family
''will probably receive less than one-half of 1 percent of the
settlement'' -- about $90,000. The law firm that represented the
estate, Miller, Cassidy, Larroca &AMP; Lewin, will get about $7.4
million and $2.75 million will go for federal and New Jersey estate
taxes, including interest.
</P>
<P>
   The chief beneficiary of the settlement will be the Richard
Nixon Library and Birthplace Foundation, an educational foundation
based in Yorba Linda, Calif., which the estate estimated would
receive about $6 million. Directors of the foundation, which
operates a privately funded archive and museum, the Yorba Linda
burial site of Nixon and his wife, Pat, and the Nixon Center, a
foreign policy think tank in Washington, will decide how the funds
will be used.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expressed a sense of satisfaction and pleasure that
President Nixon's wish, which was that resources from this matter
would enable the Nixon Foundation to continue to expand it's
nonprofit educational mission, has been fulfilled,'' said John
Taylor, who spoke on behalf of the estate. ''I believe it is an
amply fair and equitable compromise.''

<HEADLINE> Marlins 5, Phillies 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Alex Gonzalez and Paul Bako each hit two-run
triples as the Florida Marlins defeated the Philadelphia Phillies
5-2 Monday night in a game that included more than three hours of
rain delays.
</P>
<P>
   The start was delayed for 59 minutes, and the game was stopped
again for 2 hours, 35 minutes with a runner on first and no outs in
the bottom of the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 200 fans remained in the stands when the game was
restarted and the last out was recorded at 2:06 a.m. EDT Tuesday,
ending after all the West Coast night games.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins scored three runs in the third off Phillies starter
Cliff Politte (0-1). Preston Wilson led off with a triple, and
Derrek Lee walked one out later. Gonzalez followed with a two-run
triple, and he scored on Politte's wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Florida scored two more in the sixth when Bako's triple drove in
Wilson and Lee to give the Marlins a 5-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Vic Darensbourg (3-0) came in after the long delay and got the
victory. He allowed one run, one hit, walked one and struck out
four in three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Alfonseca pitched the ninth for his major league-leading
19th save.
</P>
<P>
   Politte pitched the first three innings before the rain delay,
but took the loss, giving up three runs, three hits and two walks
with two strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Politte drove in the Phillies' first run with a two-out RBI
single in the third. Pinch-hitter Doug Glanville homered to lead
off the fifth for Philadelphia's other run.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Politte's RBI was the first in his major league career. ...
The three triples by Florida were a season high. ... The time of
3:34 in total rain delays was the fifth-longest in Phillies
history. The longest was 5:44 against San Diego on July 2, 1993.
The team gave hats and ticket vouchers to the few fans who stayed
through the delays. Those who decided not to wait it out are still
entitled to exchange their ticket for a future game. ... Mark
Kotsay went 4-for-5 for the Marlins. ... Glanville's home run was
his first career pinch-hit homer, and the first for the Phillies
this season.

<HEADLINE> Searching for new ways to combat resurgence of West Nile like virus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. (AP) - Taking matters into their own hands,
the Dutchess County Legislature on Monday approved spending
$675,000 to kill the larvae of mosquitoes that carry the West Nile
virus.
</P>
<P>
   While there has been no evidence that the virus has ever been
present in Dutchess County, the announcement last week that two
dead birds found in nearby Rockland County were carrying the virus
have heightened fears about West Nile.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, West Nile - first misdiagnosed as St. Louis
encephalitis - killed six people in New York City and one in
Westchester and sickened more than 60. It was also blamed for
hundreds of bird deaths - mostly crows - in New York, New Jersey
and Connecticut, and it killed several horses on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Caldwell, Dutchess County's health commissioner, is
hopeful the $675,000 will allow a larvaciding application program
to begin in early July.
</P>
<P>
   The money should cover at least three rounds of applications in
approximately 50,000 municipal catch basins and other water
sources.
</P>
<P>
   The recent heavy rains would have wiped out any existing
mosquito larvae - which breed mainly in standing water, according
to Caldwell.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're really right at the right time,'' Caldwell said.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the county spent $171,990 to publicize residents'
role in combating mosquito problems and to contract with Hudsonia
Ltd., a nonprofit research and environmental research group, to
provide surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell said his department is citing people whose property has
unusually large amounts of trash or tires, which contribute to the
development of mosquito larvae.
</P>
<P>
   While most people comply once notified, those who don't could
face consequences. ''Eventually, people could be fined,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Three New York lawmakers said they will seek to triple the
federal money available to battle the West Nile Virus that left
seven people dead in the New York City area last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, Reps. Nita Lowey, D-Westchester County,
and Joseph Crowley, D-Queens, said they will push for $15 million
over the next two years - $5 million this fiscal year and $10
million in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   That is up from the $5 million in federal funds that has already
been appropriated.
</P>
<P>
   The money would go to the Centers for Disease Control to fund
research about how the virus spreads and the best ways to eradicate
it.
</P>
<P>
   Costs of combatting the mosquitos that carry the virus have been
left to state and city officials. New York shelled out $10 million
last year to spray the pesticide malathion from helicopters and on
other efforts to kill virus-bearing mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   West Nile virus can cause a range of symptoms. In the most
serious cases, infection can result in encephalitis, or swelling of
the brain. Elderly individuals, or those with compromised immune
systems, are most at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Birds harbor the disease and many are susceptible to it, but
they cannot transmit it to humans.

<HEADLINE> Gore To Kickoff Campaign Tour  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore was still putting
the finishing touches on the kickoff speech for his upcoming
''progress and prosperity tour'' when Republicans began heckling
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee suggested a better name would
be the ''Broken Promises Tour.'' New York Gov. George Pataki said
Congress and the nation's governors share credit for prosperous
times, and he accused Gore of trying to claim he ''invented
prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's three-week tour through battleground states, which begins
Tuesday, touches on a sensitive issue in campaign 2000: who,
exactly, deserves credit for the prolonged economic expansion and
resulting federal budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told a group of Democratic contributors Monday that he and
President Clinton deserve at least some of the credit for enacting,
over much controversy, a deficit-reduction measure in 1993 that
included tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president will press the idea again on Tuesday, when he
kicks off his tour with a speech in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ''Together, as a nation, we turned the biggest deficits in our
history into the biggest surpluses in our history,'' says a draft
of Gore's speech, excerpts of which were provided to The Associated
Press. ''None of this happened by accident. It happened because
together with the American people we put into place a brand new
economic strategy, one that unlocked the full potential of our
people -- balancing the budget, paying down the debt and investing
in the best enterprise of all: People. Americans themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize his link with the Clinton administration economic
record, Gore invited former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin to join
him for part of the tour.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will discuss health care Wednesday in Scranton, Pa., then
make his pitch for modest, targeted tax cuts on Thursday in
Cincinnati. Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said Friday's event will
occur in the Washington, D.C., area. The tour will resume next
Tuesday and hit other ''key battleground states around the
country,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   In his kickoff speech Tuesday in New York, Gore was expected to
propose funneling Medicare's annual hospital fund surpluses into a
''lock box'' that would reduce the national debt and prohibit
either party from using the money for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Previewing his prosperity trip on Monday, Gore told 100
supporters at a fund-raiser in New York: ''Instead of the biggest
deficits we now have the biggest surplus. Instead of a triple-dip
recession we've seen a tripling of the stock market. ... And
officially as of two months ago, we now have the longest economic
expansion, the strongest economic recovery and the healthiest
economy in the entire 211-year history of the American economy.
That is a success story.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he will sketch out a three-part strategy for building on
prosperous times. He pledged that, if elected president, he will
reduce the federal debt every year, ''invest'' in programs like
teacher training and prescription drug coverage, and open new
markets for trade.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Gore took part in a 90-minute televised forum
sponsored by Oxygen, the new cable television network developed by
Oprah Winfrey and devoted to women's issues.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen promoted the event as: ''Al Gore gets in touch with his
feminine side.''

<HEADLINE> Bancomer Board Backs Bank Merger  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The board of Mexico's second-largest bank has
backed a planned merger with a Spanish banking giant, opening the
door to the most dramatic foray into Mexico by a foreign banking
heavyweight.
</P>
<P>
   The board of Bancomer said late Monday that it is recommending
shareholders approve the merger with the local unit of Spanish
banking giant Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA.
</P>
<P>
   Bancomer said in a press release that a reworked merger plan
with BBVA's unit Grupo Financiero BBV-Probursa SA calls for a total
capital investment of $2.5 billion, of which $1.4 billion will come
from BBVA.
</P>
<P>
   Under the original terms of the deal, BBVA had agreed to invest
about $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''This alliance is unbeatable,'' BBVA chairman Emilio Ybarra
said in a separate press release. ''It represents a great
opportunity both for Bancomer and for BBVA, and therefore for
Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   The merged company, to be called Grupo Financiero BBVA-Bancomer,
will be one of Latin America's largest financial institutions. The
new company will have more than $366 million in assets and about
2,000 bank branches throughout Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The merger is expected to take place July 1, though it still
needs shareholder and regulatory approval. Bancomer is planning a
shareholders meeting for June 29.
</P>
<P>
   The planned merger marks the first time a foreign bank has
forged an alliance with a Mexican bank without the federal
government's help. Global heavyweights have been poised to move in
since Mexico eliminated a law in late 1998 that prevented foreign
companies from acquiring more than a 20 percent stake in banks with
more than a 6 percent market share.

<HEADLINE> Inmates Training Pets in Prison  </HEADLINE>
By REBECCA COOK
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURDY, Wash. (AP) -- Behind six locked doors and two layers of
razor wire, Jennifer Palmer cuddles a fellow inmate -- her golden
retriever, Tanner.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Palmer's only skills appeared to be selling drugs
and surviving on the streets. Not anymore: At the maximum security
Washington State Correctional Center for Women, Palmer and other
inmates are training dogs like Tanner to be service animals for the
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   It's a win-win-win situation: It's good for the dogs, often
adopted from shelters where they'd otherwise be killed. It's good
for the disabled, who experience a new world of freedom with the
dogs at their side. And it can forever change the lives of the
inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've learned responsibility. I know now it depends on me to
change my life,'' said Palmer, 29, who is serving almost four years
on drug charges. ''Doing this has given me some self esteem. This
is something I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   The program works, by all indications. In Washington state, the
recidivism rate for participants over the last three years is zero.
Prisons in Connecticut, Kansas, Florida, Maine, Massachusetts,
Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Wisconsin and New York have started similar
programs, and other states are considering it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is absolutely the best program that a correctional
institution can have,'' said Nancy Bouchard, associate commissioner
with the Maine Department of Corrections, which started the program
in October and is expanding it. ''Learning how to take care of
something else other than just yourself -- that is a lesson that is
critical in a corrections setting.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Sister Pauline Quinn persuaded skeptical
officials to start the dog-training program in 1981 at the women's
prison located across Puget Sound from Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, a former street kid herself, believes the unconditional
love of a dog can work miracles.
</P>
<P>
   ''In order to change our lives, we have to feel we are accepted
and loved,'' she said. ''People may have made a mistake in life,
but they can change.''
</P>
<P>
   Five women at the 759-inmate prison participate in the program,
with another four expected to start soon. Because of limited funds,
staff, and dogs, the program can take only about 10 women at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   More than 75 women have taken part since the program began. They
first must pass a 12-week course, where they learn the basics of
dog care, grooming and training.
</P>
<P>
   They work at a prison kennel in the mornings, feeding and
grooming the dozens of dogs and a few cats boarded there by private
owners. The boarding and grooming fees, plus donations and grants,
sustain the nonprofit program.
</P>
<P>
   One recent morning, Palmer gently snipped away tufts of hair
from a trembling white poodle named Ragamuffin. Tanner, watching by
Palmer's feet, thumped his tail and licked the bars of his kennel
plaintively.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every dog is different, so it teaches you patience,'' she
said, stepping back to scrutinize Ragamuffin's hairdo. Palmer hopes
to find work as a dog groomer when she is released later this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Training starts with simple stuff: sit, stay, come. Then it gets
more complicated: inmates teach the dogs to switch lights on and
off, to support someone who walks with a cane, to take laundry out
of the dryer and put it in a basket and countless other tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Only 20 percent of the dogs have the temperament to complete the
eight-month training, said Executive Director Beth Rivard. The rest
are adopted out into the community as ''paroled pets.'' It costs
about $5,000 to train one service dog, she said, and the disabled
recipients pay only a $25 application fee.
</P>
<P>
   At night, the dogs live in cells with their convict caretakers.
For the inmates, many of whom left behind children in the outside
world, the dogs are an emotional lifeline.
</P>
<P>
   They also are a second chance -- for both the women and their
dogs. Palmer, who said she was abused by her father and her
boyfriend, sees a kindred soul in the rescued dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Someone gave up on them,'' she said in a low, guarded voice.
''You see a dog whose whole spirit has been broken, and you can
change that -- that's amazing.''

<HEADLINE> Solomon Island Premier To Resign  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONIARA, Solomon Islands (AP) -- The prime minister of the
Solomon Islands said Tuesday that he has no safe choice but to
resign despite worries that the move could cause more rebel
fighting and lead to the breakup of the South Pacific nation.
</P>
<P>
   In an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, Bartholomew
Ulufa'alu also said his government could have solved the tensions
flaring over two battling rebel groups if New Zealand and Australia
had sent a few hundred troops to help bring stability to the main
island of Guadalcanal.
</P>
<P>
   Ulufa'alu said he would stand down Thursday, regardless of the
outcome of a parliamentary vote of no confidence on his leadership
set for that day. He dismissed the vote as an attempt to give a
forced change of leadership a veneer of legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was the result of a deal with rebels who seized
Ulufa'alu at gunpoint June 5 and demanded that he resign. A few
days later, they released him and allowed him to stay in office
until the parliament decided his future.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the entire process ''a sheer mockery of democracy,''
Ulufa'alu said he is resigning under duress, fearing that the
rebels would harm his family and Cabinet ministers if he stayed in
office.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to be part of the new government,'' Ulufa'alu
said in his small wood-paneled office in the capital, Honiara. The
vote ''is an insult to my integrity, to my family and the people in
my constituency.''
</P>
<P>
   Chain-smoking and looking despondent with his shirt half
untucked, Ulufa'alu said he comes from a big tribe and his ''people
are not going to just sit back.'' When asked if they might take up
arms and seek revenge, the prime minister said, ''Others can do it.
Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   The conflict involves Isatabu residents of Guadalcanal who have
been forcing migrant Malaitans back to Malaita island 60 miles
away. In the past 18 months, about 20,000 Malaitans have been
kicked off Guadalcanal, where the nation's capital is located.
</P>
<P>
   In response, a group called the Malaita Eagle Force raided an
armory a week ago and used the weapons to stage a stunning seizure
of the capital and Ulufa'alu.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the out-armed Isatabus have retreated to the
countryside, while Malaitan rebels have set up checkpoints around
the capital. In the city, the rebels have taken over police duties,
preventing looting and unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Ulufa'alu blamed New Zealand and Australia for refusing his
request several weeks ago to send a few hundred troops to help
bring stability to Guadalcanal. The two regional powers have a
responsibility for keeping stability in the South Pacific, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, this sprawling group of islands of 455,000 people, made up
of a complex mix of tribes and islanders is on the verge of
splitting, Ulufa'alu said. The Solomon Islands, a former British
colony, became self-governing in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do Australians want this country to be fragmented?'' asked the
prime minister, elected in 1997. ''Would it be cheaper for them to
have three, five or six separate countries? This is something
Australian and New Zealand voters should realize because it's going
to fall sooner or later.''
</P>
<P>
   Australia is the largest aid donor to the Solomon Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, foreign ministers from Australia and New Zealand
were part of a delegation that visited, seeking a peaceful solution
to the crisis. The officials told the government that the two
nations wouldn't consider sending troops until leaders in the
Solomon Islands can negotiate a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But Ulufa'alu said such an agreement will be highly unlikely
because the Malaita rebels will not want to return their stolen
machine guns and other weapons -- the sources of their influence on
the next government.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very dangerous precedent we are about to set and the
same thing (a coup) will happen again,'' said Ulufa'alu, an
economist and former consultant to the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   There has been concern that most of the 50 members of parliament
will not show up for Thursday's vote, fearing for their safety. But
the vote can take place if lawmakers do not request that the
parliament speaker demand a quorum, or 26 total votes.
</P>
<P>
   The Solomon Islands are a chain of six main islands and dozens
of smaller ones lying 1,600 miles northeast of Sydney, Australia.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Report: Danforth Rebuffs Vice Pres.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Former Sen. John Danforth has withdrawn his
name from the list of potential running mates for George W. Bush,
according to a published report.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said the idea of running for vice president ''very
tempting'' and ''would have been a dream.'' But, after mulling it
over for two weeks, he said he and his wife Sally decided they
didn't want to give up living in Missouri and their close contact
with family here.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't want politics to totally define who we were,''
Danforth told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in a story for Tuesday's
paper. ''The last six years have been the best years of our lives.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, who retired from the Senate in 1994 after three terms,
is now the special counsel overseeing an investigation in the Waco
standoff and fire.
</P>
<P>
   Recent reports placed him on a short list of vice presidential
prospects for Bush, the likely Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said he called Bush and former Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney, who heads Bush's vice presidential search team, last week
about his decision.
</P>
<P>
   He said he made up his mind after waking up in the middle of the
night with the memory of a visit by then-Secretary of State George
Shultz when Danforth was in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were a couple of Secret Service people standing in our
back yard in the dark, and I remembered that,'' Danforth said.
''It's the fact that if you do that (high-level of a) job, it
crowds out everything else in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign press secretary Mindy Tucker declined to comment
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Gore Behind Bush On Leadership  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Al Gore launches a ''prosperity tour'' to
boast of economic progress, slightly more of the public says in a
poll that it trusts George W. Bush to manage the economy.
</P>
<P>
   An ABC-Washington Post poll released Monday showed that 46
percent of Americans said they trusted Bush, the Republican, with
the economy more than Democrat Gore, 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the vice president, embarks Tuesday on a three-week tour
of key swing states to trumpet the economic expansion that has
taken place during the Clinton-Gore years.
</P>
<P>
   Public reservations about Gore extend to his leadership skills.
By a 2-to-1 margin, respondents said they thought Bush, the Texas
governor, was a strong leader, but were evenly split on Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's vulnerabilities don't appear to have created a huge
gulf between him and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Among registered voters, Bush was favored by 49 percent and Gore
by 44 percent, close to the margin between them a month ago in the
same poll. Including Reform Party contender Pat Buchanan and Green
Party candidate Ralph Nader in a four-way race did not alter the
dynamics significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore were ranked about even on the issue of Social
Security, traditionally a strong area for Democrats. Bush's
proposal to let Americans invest part of their Social Security
taxes in the stock market has proven popular, according to other
polls.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was more trusted to understand the problems of average
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Three-fourths of those polled said they consider the American
economy excellent or good. But Gore has been unable to turn that
general optimism to his advantage.
</P>
<P>
   On tour, Gore will boast about budget surpluses that have
replaced deficits, stock market growth and other signs of a robust
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans scoff that Gore isn't responsible for the nation's
prosperity, but say it was the result of a combination of factors.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had an 8-point lead among men, while the two were basically
even among women. Gore needs to match Bush's advantage among men
with a consistent lead among women.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 1,204 adults was taken Thursday through Sunday and
has an error margin of 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinians Reopen Talks  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a White House admonition that ''time is
short,'' Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are resuming their
sputtering talks on an overall settlement that their governments
pledged to conclude by mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   It is supposed to determine the future of Jerusalem and how much
land Israel will cede to the Palestinians for a state. Refugee and
water problems also were on the agenda for the talks beginning
Tuesday at Andrews Air Force Base in suburban Maryland and at
Bolling Air Force Base in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   While negotiators at one site wrestle with long-range issues,
the other negotiators will consider how much land Israel will
surrender in a West Bank pullback due this month.
</P>
<P>
   A more aggressive U.S. role was expected, as the two sides have
not even begun official discussions about Jerusalem, part of which
Yasser Arafat is demanding as a capital for his Palestinian state,
and have made little headway on other thorny issues.
</P>
<P>
   The talks broke down two weeks ago amid violence on the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   American mediator Aaron Miller was due at the table. Last week,
after talks with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in Jerusalem and
Arafat in the West Bank town of Ramallah, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said they wanted the United States to ''call
audibles'' -- a reference to football quarterbacks calling plays at
the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   But as she headed Monday for Damascus and the funeral of Syrian
President Hafez Assad, whose own negotiations with Israel were
mired in disagreement despite a Barak offer to surrender virtually
all the Golan Heights, Albright said she did not expect a
breakthrough now.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issues are difficult and complex and will take time to
resolve,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's message to the negotiators, White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said Monday, is that ''time is short. We're
at a critical moment in this process, and all the parties need to
understand the importance of working together to bridge these
remaining differences, as difficult as they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak is trying to prepare the Israeli people for more
concessions to Arafat. He has already offered suburbs of Jerusalem
and said he would carry out this month's promised pullback on the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Israeli and Palestinian leaders have accused the other
of foot-dragging.
</P>
<P>
   Barak faces severe political problems at home, with opponents
trying to force new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat was attending Assad's funeral Tuesday and delayed until
Thursday a scheduled Washington meeting with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Albright have publicly expressed their support for
Palestinian ''aspirations,'' without specifying what they thought
Israel should do.
</P>
<P>
   At a pre-departure news conference, Albright appealed to Syria
to become part of the Middle East peace process and said she hoped
to meet with Bashar Assad while attending the funeral of his
father.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expect to, and they are working on details,'' Albright told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she said, ''It's essential for Syria to be a
part of a regional solution in the Middle East that we've all been
looking for, a way that the whole region can prosper with Israel as
an integral part of it. And that's what I hope will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Albright praised Assad on his death Saturday as
being committed to peace with Israel. Asked whether the laurels and
her attendance at the funeral were consistent with U.S. policy on
human rights and terrorism, considering that Syria is on the State
Department's list of terror-exporting states, Albright replied:
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that it's totally appropriate that we pay our respects
to a historic figure and that we express our condolences to the
people of Syria. There is no question that we need to work with the
Syrian leadership in order to accomplish a comprehensive peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Middle East Media Research Institute, a private
group, distributed an interview that Bashar Assad, heir apparent to
his father, gave to an Egyptian weekly.
</P>
<P>
   In it, Bashar Assad called Israel an enemy and said its
withdrawal from southern Lebanon was ''the beginning of a new Arab
history that will remind (people of) honorable pages of our Arab
history that abound with victories over invaders and occupiers.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This victory proves once again that the option of force is
capable of imposing a new situation ... of forcing the occupier to
withdraw using the weapon of force if the enemy does not respond to
the voice of reason,'' he was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Improved Hurricane Forecasts Sought  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- While researchers are working to improve
hurricane forecasts, many believe that more lives and property can
be saved by being better prepared to face the storms.
</P>
<P>
   ''The impact of the next hurricane is being decided right now --
in the days, weeks and months of preparation that are required to
make communities resistant to disaster,'' James Lee Witt, director
of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, told a conference on
hurricane preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   Witt spoke as top hurricane specialists gathered with emergency
management planners and broadcasters to discuss hurricane
forecasting and preparedness. The conference was sponsored by the
American Meteorological Society and The Weather Channel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mitigation will probably save more lives and property than
improving the forecast,'' agreed Richard Anthes, president of the
University Corp. for Atmospheric Research.
</P>
<P>
   ''But there is room for improving the forecast,'' he added.
''Hurricanes do have inherent predictability.''
</P>
<P>
   UCAR, based in Boulder, Colo., is a consortium of 63 colleges
and universities that do weather and climate research.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane forecasters struggle to predict the path a storm will
take, how fast it will move and, perhaps most difficult, how strong
it will be.
</P>
<P>
   But hurricanes -- also known as tropical cyclones and typhoons --
can do the unexpected, suddenly changing direction, rapidly getting
stronger, or just drifting along the coast, threatening for days
before turning inland.
</P>
<P>
   D. James Baker, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, noted that hurricane track forecast error has been
reduced over the last few decades. In the 1960s and 70s,
forecasters could predict 24 hours ahead of time a hurricane's path
within about 100 nautical miles, he said, and now they can predict
it within about 80 nautical miles. And 72 hours ahead of time, the
error has cut in half, from 400 nautical miles to 200 nautical
miles, he said. A nautical mile is 1.15 statute miles.
</P>
<P>
   One forecast that most seem to agree on is that more storms are
likely, for a variety of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricanes seem to occur more often in some decades and less
often in others, with the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico heading into
a more intense period, experts say. In addition, La Nina cooling of
the Pacific Ocean that remains under way tends to be associated
with years of more Atlantic hurricanes. And many believe that
global warming will result in more and stronger storms.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency management officials stressed the need for more lead
time in forecasts to give them time to evacuate people if needed.
But forecasters noted that increased lead time means warning a
larger area because of the uncertainty of what a storm will do.
</P>
<P>
   Because of rapid growth there are many areas of the coastline
that are so heavily populated that people are going to have to take
action well before the watch-warning phase, said Max Mayfield,
director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Witt noted that ''one out of every five people in the United
States is now at direct risk every year. In the 1990's over 2.5
million people relocated to the Southeast.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell Elsberry of the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey,
Calif., urged forecasters to seek a way to include a measure of
confidence in their forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Witt noted that traffic jams that occurred during the massive
evacuation in Hurricane Floyd forced state and federal officials to
review past practices.
</P>
<P>
   ''The good news was that hundreds of thousands of people in
several states responded to evacuation orders,'' Witt observed.
''The bad news was that their response -- which turned into the
largest evacuation in American history -- overwhelmed transportation
infrastructure in four states.''

<HEADLINE> NY Cheers Springsteen's Diallo Song  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Caught in another political storm over his
lyrics, The Boss responded by letting his music do the talking.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Springsteen performed his new song about the New York City
police killing of Amadou Diallo to a New York City crowd Monday,
despite angry police union leaders urging their members to boycott
his concert.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey rocker made no introduction and offered no
explanation of his thoughts on the song, ''American Skin (41
Shots).'' Springsteen introduced the song last week during a
concert in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   E Street Band members began the song by approaching microphones
one by one and repeating the words ''41 shots,'' referring to the
number of times four white officers shot at Diallo, a black West
African immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd began cheering in recognition of the song and
interrupted Springsteen's singing with cheers several times. It was
difficult to distinguish any boos from the traditional ''Bruce!''
chant at his shows.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is this your wallet? Is this your life?'' the unrecorded and
unreleased song goes, referring to Diallo's wallet, which police
mistook for a gun. ''You can get killed just for living in your
American skin.''
</P>
<P>
   One heckler was escorted from Madison Square Garden after he
approached the stage and flashed obscene hand gestures at
Springsteen during the song.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo, 22, was mortally wounded as he stood in the vestibule of
his Bronx home on Feb. 4, 1999. The four officers involved in the
shooting were acquitted of murder earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo's parents attended the Garden concert. Kadiatou Diallo,
the slain man's mother, has said she interprets the song as a sign
that people cared about what happened to her son.
</P>
<P>
   The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, which represents 27,000
city police officers, has urged its members not to attend -- or work
overtime security detail -- Springsteen's 10-concert stand in
protest.
</P>
<P>
   Police Lt. Eric Adams, of 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who
Care, said his group supports Springsteen and is upset that few
black artists have used their talents to support the Diallo family.
</P>
<P>
   ''We commend Bruce Springsteen, and we believe that he is
courageous in the position that he is taking,'' Adams said in a
news conference before the concert.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years ago, Springsteen was upset when his song ''Born in
the USA'' was used in President Reagan's political campaign and was
misinterpreted as a patriotic anthem.

<HEADLINE> US: Asbestos-Like Fibers in Crayons  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's top three crayon manufacturers
have agreed to reformulate their crayons to remove asbestos-like
fibers, even though government tests say the fibers pose little
risk to the health of children.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission tested 25 crayons made by
major manufacturers and found three contained amounts of asbestos
too small to be scientifically significant, spokesman Russ Rader
said Monday. However, 21 of the crayons contained larger amounts of
''transitional fiber,'' which is similar to asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   Rader said because the fibers are imbedded in wax the chance of
a child being exposed is extremely small, but as a precaution they
had asked crayon manufacturers to reformulate their products.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where children are concerned you have to be extra cautious,''
said CPSC Chairwoman Ann Brown. ''The risk is low, but the concerns
with these fibers should not be ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   Dixon Ticonderoga, which makes Prang crayons, and Rose Art have
agreed to use new formulas within a year, Rader said.
</P>
<P>
   Binney and Smith, makers of Crayola crayons, also said they
would follow the agency's recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect that we'll be able to begin producing reformulated
crayons that are equally safe, with the same quality,'' said Mark
Schwab, the company's president.
</P>
<P>
   Binney and Smith has said testing by an independent
government-certified lab found no asbestos in Crayola crayons.
</P>
<P>
   In a report published May 23, two labs hired by the Seattle-Post
Intelligencer found 32 of 40 crayons from the three brands had
asbestos contamination above trace levels. The article prompted
inquiries by the government and within the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The safety commission researchers found trace amounts of
asbestos in two Crayola crayons and in one Prang crayon. But of the
25 tested, only two Crayola and two Rose Art crayons contained none
of the transitional fibers.
</P>
<P>
   There are no known reports of anyone getting sick from using or
making crayons. And asbestos-related illness tends to result from
exposure to airborne fibers, typically found in an industrial
setting.
</P>
<P>
   The agency researchers simulated a child using crayons for half
an hour and found no fibers in the air. They also concluded that
even if a child ate a crayon, there would be a low risk of exposure
because the fibers are imbedded in wax.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to allay parents' concerns and teachers' concerns.
They can continue to allow children to use crayons without worry,''
Rader said. ''They crayons are not harmful.''
</P>
<P>
   The asbestos and similar fibers in crayons are found in talc,
which is used to keep crayons from breaking. The fibers exist
naturally in the environment and become mixed in with the talc when
that mineral is mined.
</P>
<P>
   Rader said that even though the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention has recommended that the transitional fibers be listed
as a potential cancer-causing material along with asbestos, the
safety commission decided there was no scientific basis for a
crayon recall.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 62 Early; Nasdaq Drops 48  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened mostly lower Tuesday after Wall
Street investment firm Sanford Bernstein cut its rating and
earnings estimates for Hewlett-Packard. The downgrade raised
concerns that technology companies will not meet investors' lofty
expectations for profit growth.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 61.52 to 10,502.69.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was down 1.87 to 1,444.13, and the Nasdaq composite index
was down 47.89 at 3,720.02.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard fell $7.625 to $118.375, contributing most to
the Dow's decline. Sanford Bernstein lowered its rating on
Hewlett-Packard to a ''market perform'' from ''buy'' and reduced
earnings estimates.
</P>
<P>
   A broad range of technology companies fell as investors worried
that they, too, will see slower earnings growth. Qualcomm fell
$1.625 to $80.063 and Yahoo! fell $2.188 to $135.25.
</P>
<P>
   The weakness in technology kept the broad market from advancing
even after a favorable report on retail sales. The Commerce
Department said retail sales fell for the second month in a row in
May, the latest sign that six interest rate increases by the
Federal Reserve are successfully slowing consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   Investors took the news as a sign that the Fed might hold rates
steady at its next meeting on June 28.
</P>
<P>
   Still, retail companies that are bearing the brunt of consumers'
moderating behavior fell. Wal-Mart fell $1 to $51.75.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall, Led by Hewlett-Packard  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly lower Tuesday after Wall
Street investment firm Sanford Bernstein cut its rating and
earnings estimates for Hewlett-Packard. The downgrade raised
concerns that technology companies will not meet investors' lofty
expectations for profit growth.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 26.17 to 10,538.04.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 3.98 to 1,449.98, and the Nasdaq composite index was
down 31.29 at 3,736.62.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard fell $7.75 to $118.25, contributing most to the
Dow's decline. Sanford Bernstein lowered its rating on
Hewlett-Packard to a ''market perform'' from ''buy'' and reduced
earnings estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone thinks the disease is going to spread to the entire
sector,'' said Don Selkin, chief investment strategist at Joseph
Gunnar in New York. ''We don't think that's the case. Technology
companies should still outpace the S&AMP;P 500 in terms of earnings
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a broad range of technology companies fell as investors
worried that they, too, will see slower earnings growth. IBM fell
$1.25 to $117.625 and Yahoo! fell $2.188 to $135.25.
</P>
<P>
   The weakness in technology kept the broad market from advancing
even after a favorable report on retail sales. The Commerce
Department said retail sales fell for the second month in a row in
May, the latest sign that six interest rate increases by the
Federal Reserve are successfully slowing consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, revised figures showed that retail sales fell 0.6
percent in April, much weaker than the government estimated one
month ago. The combination of two weaker-than-expected months at
the nation's stores allowed investors to hope that the Fed might
hold rates steady at its next meeting on June 28.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got the number the market wanted, but the market is
overreacting to the negative and disregarding the positive,''
Selkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Retail companies that are bearing the brunt of consumers'
moderating behavior fell. Wal-Mart slipped 18.75 cents to $52.563.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 264.71 million
shares, ahead of Monday's quiet pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 5.61 to 502.90.

<HEADLINE> New Soap Operas Focus on Lessons  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The young lovers are quarreling and, in
soap-opera fashion, a meddling mother-in-law is having her say.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more at stake than romance: The teen-age bride wants
to stay in school while her husband is demanding she be a
stay-at-home wife.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thrash her if she raises her voice,'' the mother-in-law
advises with a slap and a snarl. ''Burn her books.''
</P>
<P>
   Up to 200 million viewers in India tuned in weekly to the TV
serial ''Humraahi'' for such juicy drama. What they also got was a
morality play about the importance of respecting women and the
possibility that girls might seek more than an early marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Lessons, not lip gloss, are the hallmark of the television and
radio soaps developed by Population Communications International, a
privately funded, 15-year-old nonprofit organization based in New
York but with a very wide reach.
</P>
<P>
   Working with local partners and officials on four continents, in
countries including China, Kenya, Mexico and Brazil, PCI tackles
such sensitive issues as family planning, gender equality and AIDS
prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The homefront isn't ignored: On Saturday, PCI will hold its
second ''Prime Time Summit,'' meeting with TV producers and writers
in Hollywood to encourage them to examine topics including
diversity and domestic violence in their series. Similar meetings
have been held with the soap opera industry since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to use soap operas to change attitudes or to
encourage behaviors that help the public health,'' said PCI
president David J. Andrews. ''To the extent we can capture and
maintain the audience's attention over years of episodes, we can do
a lot to have a direct influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Fox, PCI senior vice president for U.S. programs, said
there can be a ''derisive attitude'' toward soap operas: '''You're
using this silly thing to deal with profound issues.' But soap
operas are internationally popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike dry lectures or books, serials are a sugar-coated
approach. PCI's longest-running show, the 7-year-old radio drama
''Twende na Wakati'' (Let's Go with the Times), is practically an
institution in Tanzania, said Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know of a soap opera in Madagascar that was so popular that
the bishop of a church there had to change the hour of the Mass
because so many people were home watching the show,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bai Xing'' (Ordinary People), PCI's Chinese serial that
focused on women's status and the preference for male babies, was
honored by China's Ministry of Culture. After just two weeks on the
air last June, it was also the most-watched serial on Channel 8.
</P>
<P>
   That PCI's programs achieve popularity and government acceptance
seems remarkable given their loaded topics and the possibility they
could be perceived as U.S. dabbling.
</P>
<P>
   The group is aware of the inherent challenge, Andrews said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we went to countries with preconceived values or cultural
biases, we would be guilty as charged,'' he said. ''The secret of
our success is we don't do that. ... The countries identify their
own issues, identify their own stories, create their own
characters.
</P>
<P>
   ''What really comes out of it is magical in that the story is so
rooted and so based in the cultural context of that country,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   PCI ventures into a nation only upon invitation and meets with
various officials, including government and religious
representatives, to determine a serial's content.
</P>
<P>
   ''The local teams prioritize themes,'' said Kate Randolph, PCI
vice president for international programs. ''In Kenya, female
circumcision was a theme that came up prominently in research. We
wouldn't say, 'This is a big problem, you have to address it.' They
chose to address it, and in the first year.''
</P>
<P>
   A PCI show has never been pulled off the air, said Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   Kimani Njogu, who is head script writer for the Kenyan radio
serial ''Ushikwapo Shikamana'' (If Assisted, Assist Yourself) and
has worked on PCI series in other countries, said sensitivity is
crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ''We respect cultures, even as we seek to intervene,'' Njogu
said. ''Moreover, we always seek to provide all possible arguments
for and against the issue at hand so that religious, cultural,
gender arguments are heard on air.''
</P>
<P>
   PCI soaps feature strongly ''negative'' characters -- such as a
drug-dealing, philandering husband who exposes his wife to the risk
of HIV infection -- and upright role models.
</P>
<P>
   ''The positive characters are usually rewarded. Not with cars or
jewelry, but with lives that get better,'' Randolph said.
</P>
<P>
   The format can be effective, according to a University of New
Mexico study released last year. In Tanzania, where the average
woman has more than five children, those who listened to ''Twende
na Wakati'' were twice as likely to adopt family planning.
</P>
<P>
   PCI, which counts among its financial supporters the Ford
Foundation and Bill Gates, also is conducting a year-long public
awareness campaign that asks Americans to consider their role in
population growth. With Walter Cronkite as honorary chairman, the
campaign began last fall when the planet reached 6 billion people.
</P>
<P>
   PCI's focus, initially limited to population control through
family planning, broadened in 1994 after a 179-nation conference in
Egypt on population and development.
</P>
<P>
   ''The realization hit home that what really makes a difference
is when population is addressed in the context of women's rights,''
Andrews said, adding that ''soap operas seem able to absorb an
enormous number of issues.''

   CIVIL RIGHTS: Justice may yet prevail for victims of decades-old
civil-rights attrocities. Last week, 34 years after the racially
charged murder of a Mississippi black man, Ben Chester White, the
U.S. Justice Department announced the indictment of Ernest Avants,
who has lived freely since his acquittal on state murder charges in
1966. A ''20/20'' report by correspondent Connie Chung last
November uncovered information that led federal investigators to
re-open the case after more than three decades. Chung updates the
story tonight (June 14) at 10 p.m. Eastern on ABC News' ''20/20.''
Her hour-long report also unveils the identity of an FBI informant
and former Ku Klux Klansman who, for the first time, provides
information about who murdered two Mississippi black men, Charles
Moore and Henry Dee, in 1964. ''I'd like to clear my conscience,''
the man tells Chung.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Tuesday after Wall Street
investment firm Sanford Bernstein cut its rating and earnings
estimates for Hewlett-Packard. The downgrade raised concerns that
technology companies will not meet investors' lofty expectations
for profit growth.
</P>
<P>
   But the broad market was holding up relatively well after a
muted retail sales report raised hopes that the Federal Reserve
will soon stop raising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 2.13 at 10,562.08. The blue-chip index had pared
an early loss of as much as 71 points.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 9.06 at 1,455.06, and the Nasdaq composite index was
down 23.18 at 3,744.73.
</P>

<HEADLINE> White House: GOP Drug Plan Flawed  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said a Republican-backed
health care plan ''claims to help everybody but is a false hope for
most,'' as the White House and congressional Republicans touted
dueling programs to help older Americans pay for medication.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans provided more details on Tuesday of a proposal
they announced earlier this year that would enlist private insurers
to sell government-subsidized and -approved prescription drug
policies to Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the private sector can do a great job,'' said Rep.
Bill Thomas, R-Calif., the leading architect of the GOP plan.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying at a hearing on competing drug proposals, held by the
House Ways and Means Committee, Thomas said the White House
criticism is politically motivated and inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The comments that are being made are an attempt to drive a
wedge,'' he said, noting that two Democrats, Reps. Collin Peterson,
D-Minn., and Ralph Hall, D-Texas, have stepped up to endorse the
GOP plan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted bipartisan support for an expansion of Medicare to
cover the cost of prescription drugs, but said only his plan offers
the elderly an honest deal. Adding the coverage -- which was left
out of the original Medicare program created in 1965 -- is a popular
election year issue.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and fellow Democrats claim the GOP plan would help too
few people, while Republicans claim the White House plan to too
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we were in deficit and trying to do this, I would
understand why we would say, 'Well, we can't help everybody so
we'll just help a few.''' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But that's not the situation. We can afford to do this right,
and we must not pass a plan that claims to offer something to
everybody and is a false hope to most and therefore inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said the GOP plan in fact has several features to ensure
it would provide help paying for drugs to all senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   First, he said the government would pay insurers 30 percent to
35 percent subsidies to ensure that new drug policies are
affordable to all -- not just retirees with the lowest incomes,
whose drug insurance premiums would be paid for directly by
Medicare under the GOP plan.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas also said that the government would act as the ''insurer
of last resort,'' if private plans failed to step up to offer
adequate coverage across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposes a standard drug benefit under Medicare, which
would be available to all elderly and disabled people who use the
federal program. Those who opted for the drug coverage would pay a
monthly premium, starting at $26, and a 50 percent co-payment
toward their prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the competing Republican plan relies in part on an
idea that has already failed -- so-called ''Medigap'' coverage
already offered by some private insurers to cover the cost of
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Many elderly in the audience for a White House press conference
Tuesday said they cannot afford that private coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the insurance industry continues to be skeptical
about the feasibility of the GOP plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will withhold judgment on the House Republican proposal
until we see its details. Nevertheless, we continue to believe the
concept of so-called drug-only private insurance simply would not
work in practice,'' said a written statement Tuesday from Chip
Kahn, president of the Health Insurance Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and about a dozen lawmakers from rural areas also
pointed Tuesday to a new White House analysis of the plight of the
rural elderly, who generally pay more for their drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''In short, rural areas are being denied lifesaving treatment
because of where they live,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., who
asked for the study.
</P>
<P>
   Older Americans who live far from major cities are 60 percent
less likely to get the drugs they need, and they pay around 25
percent more for the medications, the White House study of Medicare
recipients said. About 29 percent of rural elderly spend more than
5 percent of their income on out-of-pocket prescription drugs,
compared to 21 percent of city-dwelling seniors, the same study
found.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, rural Medicare recipients are 50 percent less
likely to have any coverage for the cost of prescription drugs, the
White House claims.

<HEADLINE> Lex Luthor To Run for President  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Maybe it was inevitable in a year filled with
talk about actors and even a potted plant running for president:
Lex Luthor, Superman's nemesis, will announce his candidacy
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   DC Comics, publisher of the Superman series, insists Luthor is
different. Cartoon though he may be, ''Luthor is a serious
candidate,'' said writer J.M. DeMatteis. ''Donald Trump he's not.''
</P>
<P>
   The real estate tycoon Luthor has some negatives, including past
attempts to assassinate Superman and a nasty reputation for shady
backroom dealings. On the other hand, Luthor, who has been on
somewhat of a redemptive kick lately, has the distinction of being
the only person to have saved both Gotham City and Metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, he can afford to bypass federal campaign spending limits
by financing his third-party campaign himself.
</P>
<P>
   Luthor will officially launch his run on Wednesday in a DC
Comics issue, although the company says the campaign won't pick up
steam until late August.

<HEADLINE> Education Department May Be Audited  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House lawmakers angered over fraud in the
Education Department -- including a $1 million employee theft ring --
approved legislation requiring the agency be audited by
congressional investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 380-19 Tuesday to direct the General Accounting
Office, Congress' auditing arm, to study department accounts
particularly prone to abuse. Last month, federal officials
discovered an employee theft ring that had cost the agency more
than $1 million in stolen equipment and falsely reported overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The department, whose budget is more than $32 billion and which
manages billions more in student loans, also has paid grant winners
twice and forgiven loans for fraudulent borrowers. Rep. Pete
Hoekstra, main sponsor of the legislation, said the agency sent
duplicate checks to contractors and grantees this year totaling
about $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are talking about some of the most important dollars that
we spend in Washington today,'' said Hoekstra, R-Mich., chairman of
the House Education and Workforce oversight subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Department officials said a special probe is unwarranted because
its internal auditors have worked with the FBI and other
investigators to uncover fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is our position that the inspector general, whenever there
is any question raised of wrongdoing or fraud, has thoroughly and
promptly investigated,'' said Erica Lepping, spokeswoman for
Education Secretary Richard Riley.
</P>
<P>
   Independent auditors the department hired to review fiscal year
1998 financial records concluded they could not offer an opinion on
the agency's accounting.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are dealing with this issue because of the Department of
Education's inability to receive a clean audit,'' said Hoekstra.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the department's internal watchdog nor the independent
auditing firm has confirmed any financial mismanagement. Education
Department Inspector General Lorraine Lewis would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill was opposed only by Democrats. Sen. Tim
Hutchinson, R-Ark., is pushing a similar bill in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Jarmon, who handles education and other issues for the
GAO, said the investigative agency would not duplicate Lewis' work.
The fraud audit, likely to focus on student loans, will examine all
transactions instead of a sample and check documents for forgeries,
rather than ''just accepting documentation at face value.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarmon said the office gets regular requests to examine
agencies, but legislation requiring an audit is not so common.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 4079.

<HEADLINE> IMF Chief To Visit African Nations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Horst Koehler, the International Monetary
Fund's managing director, will visit five African nations next
month, the IMF said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler goes to Nigeria on July 2-3, Senegal July 4, Cameroon
July 5, Mozambique July 6, and South Africa July 7-8, the IMF said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The trip's purpose is to ''hear perspectives on critical issues
the African continent is facing,'' the IMF said. ''He is
particularly interested in the views of African countries on the
role of the IMF and its involvement in restructuring their
economies.''
</P>
<P>
   Koehler, who took over as the IMF chief May 2, has already
visited in Latin America and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Africa represents a sensitive region politically for the IMF,
given past criticisms that it has contributed to the hardships of
the poorest there by imposing fiscal austerity on nations who
qualify for long-term IMF loans.
</P>
<P>
   Nongovernmental organizations recently criticized the IMF for
its demands that Mozambique sharply cut the sugar tariffs that
protect its struggling sugar industry from import competition.
</P>
<P>
   Many argue that exposing Mozambique's sugar industry to
potential damaging competition will only encourage other African
nations to continue relying on traditional industries, particularly
gold, platinum and diamond mining, that have often been catalysts
for civil wars.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 23; Dow Dips 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Tuesday after Wall Street
investment firm Sanford Bernstein cut its rating and earnings
estimates for Hewlett-Packard. The downgrade raised concerns that
technology companies will not meet investors' lofty expectations
for profit growth.
</P>
<P>
   But the broad market was holding up relatively well after a
muted retail sales report raised hopes that the Federal Reserve
will soon stop raising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 3.89 at 10,560.32. The blue-chip index had pared
an early loss of as much as 71 points.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 8.35 at 1,454.35, and the Nasdaq composite index was
down 22.87 at 3,745.04.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard fell $7 to $119, pulling the Dow lower. Sanford
Bernstein lowered its rating on Hewlett-Packard to a ''market
perform'' from ''buy'' and reduced earnings estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone thinks the disease is going to spread to the entire
sector,'' said Don Selkin, chief investment strategist at Joseph
Gunnar in New York. ''We don't think that's the case. Technology
companies should still outpace the S&AMP;P 500 in terms of earnings
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a broad range of technology companies fell as investors
worried that they, too, will see slower earnings growth. IBM fell
$1.188 to $117.688 and Yahoo! fell $3.938 to $133.50.
</P>
<P>
   The weakness in technology kept the broad market from advancing
even after a favorable report on retail sales. The Commerce
Department said retail sales fell for the second month in a row in
May, the latest sign that six interest rate increases by the Fed
are successfully slowing consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, revised figures showed that retail sales fell 0.6
percent in April, much weaker than the government estimated one
month ago. The combination of two weaker than expected months at
the nation's stores allowed investors to hope that the Fed might
hold rates steady at its next meeting on June 28.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got the number the market wanted, but the market is
overreacting to the negative and disregarding the positive,''
Selkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors are also concerned that the highly
coveted slowdown, which the Fed hopes will prevent inflation from
rearing up, will eventually hurt corporate earnings. Tuesday,
investors who were ready to buy embraced so-called ''defensive''
stocks -- those whose profits aren't significantly affected by
fluctuations in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Merck rose $3.063 to $73 and Warner Lambert rose $3.688 to
$126.75.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-6 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 587.57 million
shares, ahead of Monday's quiet pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 5.37 to 503.14.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Warns Burundian Lawmakers  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHE NKURUNZIZA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) -- Nelson Mandela warned Burundian
lawmakers Tuesday that delay in integrating the country's armed
forces would encourage Hutu rebels and prolong the 7-year-old civil
war.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you agree to integration, then you occupy higher moral
ground than the rebels. By delaying...you give them space to
continue fighting and killing people,'' the former South African
president told Burundi's National Assembly in the capital,
Bujumbura.
</P>
<P>
   During a meeting with Mandela last week in South Africa,
Burundian President Pierre Buyoya agreed to incorporate Hutus into
the Tutsi-dominated army.
</P>
<P>
   Buyoya needs the support of both the military and top Tutsi
legislators to implement the measure, seen as key to ending a war
that has left at least 200,000 Burundians dead since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to an audience that included military officials,
Cabinet ministers and foreign diplomats, Mandela said he had never
seen a worse jail than Burundi's Mpimba Prison, where he visited
political prisoners on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela, who was incarcerated for 27 years in South Africa on
treason charges, invited Burundian officials and diplomats to
inspect Mpimba.
</P>
<P>
   ''You will help me a great deal if you just go and see how human
beings are treated in this country,'' he said. ''I will not recover
(from the shock) until I see the leadership here has taken
responsibility on their shoulders to relieve those people from such
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed release of political prisoners is said to be
holding up peace talks in Tanzania. Mandela said Monday their
release was a prerequisite for peace.
</P>
<P>
   The 81-year-old Mandela took over mediation of the Burundi talks
in December, succeeding the late Tanzanian President Julius
Nyerere. Since then, he has pressed for a resolution, traveling
twice to Arusha and recruiting African and European leaders, as
well as President Clinton, for help in ending the war.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Mandela praised Buyoya, a Tutsi, as being ''far
ahead of the leadership in Arusha and the leadership in Bujumbura
in bringing peace in Burundi.''
</P>
<P>
   Burundi's armed forces, as well as its economy and government,
are dominated by minority Tutsis.

<HEADLINE> Runway Near Misses Targeted by NTSB  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- ''Stop!'' shouted the frightened air traffic
controller as a giant Boeing 747 that had just landed headed into
the path of another jumbo jet preparing to take off from the
Chicago runway.
</P>
<P>
   Tragedy was avoided as the second plane climbed quickly, but the
incident was closely studied Tuesday as the National Transportation
Safety Board issued recommendations for avoiding such close calls.
</P>
<P>
   Luck was with the passengers and crew aboard the two planes,
observed NTSB Chairman Jim Hall, ''but relying on luck doesn't make
good public policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall noted that more than 320 runway close calls were reported
nationwide last year, a number that has been rising over the years
as airport traffic increases.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago case and another in Providence, R.I., in which
planes on the ground become lost in the fog were studied before the
board issued its recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Those now go to the Federal Aviation Administration, which has
already launched its own effort to reduce such incidents and plans
a national runway safety summit June 26-28.
</P>
<P>
   In the Providence case last Dec. 6, United Airlines Flight 1448
became lost in the fog and turned down a wrong taxiway leading
toward a runway where a FedEx plane was taking off.
</P>
<P>
   As it became clear from radio conversations that the United
flight wasn't where it ought to be, the air traffic controller,
also blinded by fog, ordered it to halt. She then cleared a US
Airways flight to take off, but that pilot refused to go until he
was sure where everybody was.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, after all movement at the airport was halted, the
United pilot was able to read runway signs to determine where he
was and could then taxi to a safe location so operations could
resume.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago case occurred April 1, 1999, when an Air China
International 747 cargo plane with a crew of eight aboard landed
and turned onto the wrong taxiway. It then began to cross a runway
just as a Korean Air 747 with 357 passengers and 22 crew members
started to take off.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected appearance of the Chinese jet on the runway
prompted the controller to shout ''Stop!'' just seconds before the
planes would have collided. It was too late for that, but the
Korean pilot was able to lift off early and veer sharply to the
left, avoiding disaster.
</P>
<P>
   In their recommendations, board members criticized the FAA for
slow progress in developing technology to avoid runway incidents.
They urged the agency to speed up that effort and to:
</P>
<P>
   --Require that a pilot get a specific clearance before crossing
each runway. Currently that clearance is implied when a pilot is
told to proceed to the takeoff point, or a multiple clearance may
be given to cross several runways.
</P>
<P>
   --Prohibit planes waiting to take off from idling on an active
runway at night or in conditions where they might not be visible to
incoming planes.
</P>
<P>
   --Adopt the English language phraseology recommended for ground
operations by the International Civil Aviation Organization, and
direct controllers to speak clearly and slowly, especially when
dealing with foreign planes.
</P>
<P>
   The United States already follows most ICAO terminology but
there are some differences that may confuse pilots from other
countries. For example, if an American controller wants a plane to
go to a runway and stop until given further directions, the pilot
will be told to ''taxi and hold short'' or ''position and hold
short.'' The ICAO direction would be ''line up and wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Downward looking radar is in service at some airports and that
can help controllers monitor planes' movements. Improved versions
are under development, said John Mayrhofer, director of the FAA's
runway safety program.
</P>
<P>
   A system called Airport Movement Area Safety System, to begin
service later this year, sounds an alert when planes seem to be
heading for a collision. It is expected to be in the nation's 34
busiest airports by 2002, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But NTSB officials questioned whether AMASS will give enough
warning, and urged that other systems also be studied.
</P>
<P>
   Mayrhofer said an improved system is under development that uses
ground sensors and Global Positioning System readings as well as
radar.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 63; Nasdaq Rises 44  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned mostly higher Tuesday as investors
seized on the latest retail sales report as evidence that the
economy is slowing just enough to convince the Federal Reserve to
leave interest rates unchanged at its next meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Investors' optimism over the state of the economy helped the
market break out of a slump that started after Wall Street
investment firm Sanford Bernstein cut its rating and earnings
estimates for Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow
Jones industrial average was up 62.93 at 10,627.14. The blue-chip
index had pared an early loss of as much as 71 points.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 19.94 at 1,465.94, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 43.67 at 3,811.58.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rose once investors began focusing on a favorable report
on retail sales. The Commerce Department said retail sales fell for
the second month in a row in May, the latest sign that six interest
rate increases by the Fed are successfully slowing consumer

month ago. The combination of two weaker than expected months at
the nation's stores allowed investors to hope that the Fed might
hold rates steady at its next meeting on June 28.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Fed is finished for the year,'' said Don Selkin, chief
investment strategist at Joseph Gunnar in New York. Selkin pointed
out that May economic figures don't reflect the Fed's last rate
increase, a half-percentage point boost on May 16 that drove rates
to the highest level since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will see more evidence of a slowdown, and with that
evidence in hand, the Fed really won't be able to justify raising
rates any higher,'' Selkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts said investors are also concerned that the
highly coveted slowdown, which the Fed hopes will prevent inflation
from rearing up, will eventually hurt corporate earnings. Tuesday,
investors who were ready to buy embraced so-called ''defensive''
stocks -- those whose profits aren't significantly affected by

</P>
<P>
   Merck rose $3 to $72.938 and Warner Lambert rose $3.688 to
$126.75.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard fell $7.813 to $118.313, pulling the Dow lower.
Sanford Bernstein lowered its rating on Hewlett-Packard to a
''market perform'' from ''buy'' and reduced earnings estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The warning on Hewlett-Packard prevented most technology stocks
from making significant gains.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone thinks the disease is going to spread to the entire
sector,'' Selkin said. ''We don't think that's the case. Technology
companies should still outpace the S&AMP;P 500 in terms of earnings

shares, well ahead of Monday's quiet pace.

<HEADLINE> 'Ulysses' Manuscript Displayed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- The original manuscript of James Joyce's
''Ulysses'' went on display Monday for the first time in Dublin,
the city that inspired the modernist masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce's novel records the city in precise detail, as it traces
the wanderings of protagonists Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom on
a day in June, 1904.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce once said that, if Dublin was ever destroyed, it could be
rebuilt using the novel as a blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   But not a world of the book was written in the Irish capital.
Joyce left Dublin in 1904, and wrote ''Ulysses'' between 1914 and
1921 while in Italy, Switzerland and France.
</P>
<P>
   The manuscript is the centerpiece of a Joyce exhibition at
Dublin Castle's Chester Beatty library. The exhibit, which runs
through September, opened just two days before Bloomsday, when
Joyce lovers enact scenes from ''Ulysses'' in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   An impoverished Joyce sold the original manuscript to New York
lawyer and art patron John Quinn for $12,000 dollars before its
1921 publication.
</P>
<P>
   The manuscript was later sold to Philadelphia book dealer and
collector Abraham Rosenbach, and had remained in the United States
ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Derick Dreher, director of the Rosenbach Library in
Philadelphia, where the manuscript has been kept since 1924, said
the Dublin exhibition marked the homecoming of a ''quintessentially
Irish'' work.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are amazed that it has never been here before,'' he
said.

computer images and a three-dimensional model from NASA.
</P>
<P>
   Two ''Escaping the Gravity of Earth'' hologram stamps will be
issued July 9. The Priority Mail rate --$3.20 -- stamps feature
holograms of the International Space Station.
</P>
<P>
   On July 10, six ''Probing the Vastness of Space'' stamps will be
issued. These 60-cent international rate stamps depict an
illustration of the Hubble Space Telescope and photographs of the
Very Large Array telescope system on the Plains of San Agustin,
near Socorro, N.M.; twin 10-meter optical and infrared telescopes
at Keck Observatory in Mauna Kea, Hawaii; optical telescopes at the
Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory near La Serena, Chile; the
100-inch optical telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory, near
Pasadena, Calif.; and a 305-meter radio telescope at Arecibo
Observatory in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   July 11 marks the first day for five ''Exploring the Solar
System'' stamps, the first five-sided stamps in U.S. postal
history.
</P>
<P>
   These $1 stamps present an image of a solar eclipse from a
satellite, an illustrated cutaway view of the sun, a digitally
restored NASA image of sunrise from space, an image of a solar
eruption taken by Skylab and a photo from Earth of the sun in a
partly cloudy sky.

<HEADLINE> Norwegian Oil Rig Evacuated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Rescue helicopters evacuated most of the 77
crew aboard a Norwegian offshore oil rig after several of its
anchors broke loose in the North Sea, prompting fear that it might
go adrift in a fierce storm.
</P>
<P>
   About 51 nonessential crew members had been evacuated by
helicopter, while 26 were remaining on board to control the rig
with its remaining anchors and engines, said Anders Bang-Andersen,
spokesman for the rescuers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The situation is under control, but storm winds and big waves
are not exactly a dream situation,'' he said. He said no one was
injured or in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Bang-Andersen said the rig had drifted about 925 feet out of
position before the remaining anchor chains took up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   The drilling rig had been working at the Snorre field, about 90
miles northwest of the city of Bergen, on Norway's west coast, when
its anchors dragged, probably due to extreme winds.
</P>
<P>
   According to rescuers, conditions were difficult with winds of
up to 75 mph and waves of up to 40 feet. Meteorologists predicted
that the winds would ease during the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Bang-Andersen said there was no danger of an oil spill.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a floating rig, not a permanent installation. It is
the kind of rig that is moved from place to place ... and I have no
information to indicate that it is an any danger of capsizing,''
said Helge Stiksrud, a spokesman for Norsk Hydro, which was
operating the rig.
</P>
<P>
   The Bideford Dolphin is among the most modern drilling rigs
operating off the Norwegian coast and has fully automated operating
systems, according to its owner, the Dolphin ASA concern.

<HEADLINE> Assad Was a Hero and a Dictator  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA BRYSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- To much of the outside world, the late
Syrian President Hafez Assad was a brutal dictator in the style of
another era, cutting himself and his nation off from the current of
history.
</P>
<P>
   But to many Syrians and to some in neighboring Arab states,
Assad, who died Saturday and was buried Tuesday, was a hero --
simply because he was seen as a man who would stand up to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with a visiting foreign official several years ago,
Assad was pressed to back off some of his territorial claims in
order to strike a peace deal with Israel. He rejected the argument
he could persuade his people to accept concessions, saying, a
witness recalled, that even the palace servants would revolt if he
gave up the land -- and they would be right.
</P>
<P>
   To the end, Assad refused to bend in his negotiations with
Israel over the Golan Heights, the strategic plateau lost in the
1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
   A frustrated United States saw talks it was mediating between
Syria and Israel falter in January. Syria wanted assurances that
Israel would withdraw from the Golan Heights and turn over land
extending down to the Sea of Galilee. Israel refused to make such a
pledge and insisted the issues of security arrangements and
normalization be spelled out first.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had our differences, but I always respected him,''
President Clinton said after learning of Assad's death. Clinton
telephoned Assad's son and heir apparent Bashar to offer
condolences and sent U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to
represent the United States at the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was frustrated at failing to get Assad to
strike a peace deal with Israel -- Assad would not even sit down
with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. And the envoy he did send,
his foreign minister, refused to shake Barak's hand, a snub that
drew cheers in Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The United States considered Syria a sponsor of terrorism.
Groups like New York-based Human Rights Watch decried ''Syria's
bleak human rights record'' because any challenge to government
power was brutally put down.
</P>
<P>
   Syrians who objected ended up in jail or in exile. Others
learned to cope, perhaps clinging all the more fiercely to the idea
of Assad as hero, as if the hardships were a necessary price of
living under an unwavering leader.
</P>
<P>
   Assad dreamed of an Arab world united against Israel. Instead,
Egypt and then Jordan signed peace treaties with the Jewish state,
and the Palestinians opened talks with Israel. Assad finally
decided to pursue negotiations too, when it appeared he and his
proxy state Lebanon would be the only ones left out -- and long
after his preoccupation with foreign affairs had left his
socialist-style economy in a shambles.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, though, is still trying to progress from no-war to real
peace with neighbors Egypt, with which it signed a treaty in 1979,
and Jordan, with which it signed a treaty in 1994. Ordinary
Egyptians and Jordanians who resist trade and cultural ties with
their old enemy have looked to Assad as a beacon, and militant
Palestinians who oppose their own leadership's talks with Israel
have found havens in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   Dignitaries from at least three dozen countries came to Assad's
funeral. Absent was Israel, still technically at war with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The funerals last year of Jordan's King Hussein and Morocco's
King Hassan II were watersheds, with Israel and many of the nations
at odds with it coming together in grief. Assad attended Hussein's
funeral, the only time he attended an event where Israeli leaders
were present.

<HEADLINE> Peacekeepers Fight Leone Rebels  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- U.N. peacekeepers clashed with
Sierra Leone's feared rebels near a strategic bridge in the West
African country, U.N. officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 rebel fighters made three attempts Monday night to
cross Rokel bridge, 45 miles east of the capital, Freetown, U.N.
spokeswoman Hirut Befecadu said.
</P>
<P>
   They were repelled each time by a Jordanian U.N. battalion
stationed at the bridge, which is on the road leading toward
rebel-controlled eastern Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels were believed to have suffered casualties, but there
were no U.N. troops hurt or killed.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-government forces, meanwhile, said they repelled a rebel
attack Monday at the key front-line town of Lunsar, 45 miles east
of Freetown. Two pro-government soldiers were killed and four rebel
fighters captured, an army statement said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lunsar was retaken by government forces twice last week, nearly
a month after the rebels first captured it.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolutionary United Front rebels killed tens of thousands
of civilians and systematically maimed many more during Sierra
Leone's eight-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   They signed a July peace accord with the government, but
reignited the conflict in early May, seizing about 500 U.N.
hostages and advancing toward the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages have since been released, and a ragtag coalition of
pro-government forces has been pushing the RUF away from Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   But more than 200 U.N. personnel remain surrounded in the
eastern rebel stronghold of Kailahun, and a new group of about 21
peacekeepers has been detained in nearby Pendembu.

<HEADLINE> Assad's Brother in Southern Spain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARBELLA, Spain (AP) -- Rifaat Assad, the exiled brother of
Syria's late President Hafez Assad, appeared in public Tuesday in
this posh resort town in southern Spain and said he was in deep
mourning.
</P>
<P>
   As his brother was buried in Syria, Assad spoke briefly to
reporters as he went into a whitewashed six-story office and
apartment building in Marbella, accompanied by a handful of
bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in deep sorrow and I hope you appreciate that. I hope
you appreciate our feelings now,'' said Assad, 63, who appeared
tired. ''I hope we get a chance to recuperate from our sorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for him, Al-Hareth Al-Khair, told The Associated
Press that Assad stands by a statement he issued Monday opposing
the chosen successor of the late Syrian leader, Hafez Assad's
34-year-old son Bashar Assad, saying he has no right to be
president.
</P>
<P>
   ''What (Rifaat Assad) wants is legitimacy to be present'' in
Syria, the spokesman said. ''Bashar is not legitimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Rifaat Assad, who once commanded an elite army unit, has lived
mainly in exile since 1984 after leading an apparent coup attempt
in Damascus while his brother was hospitalized from a heart attack.

<HEADLINE> Golan Heights' Druse Mourn Assad  </HEADLINE>
By SARI BASHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAJDAL SHAMS, Golan Heights (AP) -- Druse Arabs on the
Israeli-occupied Golan Heights closed businesses and hung black
flags of mourning Tuesday for the funeral of Syrian President Hafez
Assad, whom they saw as their leader.
</P>
<P>
   Most Golan Druse consider themselves Syrian in almost every way
-- but living under Israeli rule -- some dared to criticize Assad and
to express doubt about life under Syrian rule.
</P>
<P>
   The pain of separation from Syria, where most of the 17,000
Golan Druse have relatives they haven't seen since Israel captured
the Golan Heights in 1967, was evident as residents of this
bustling town watched Assad's funeral on TV and copied the mourning
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Druse draped black mourning flags, Syrian flags, and pictures of
a young healthy Assad from stores and balconies throughout their
villages, a bold step in a region where Syrian flags attract the
attention of Israeli security.
</P>
<P>
   In the main square here, a monument to a Druse hero was covered
with wreaths and pictures of Assad and banners proclaiming ''Your
memory is in our heart always.''
</P>
<P>
   A loudspeaker blared Koranic verses, and private businesses were
closed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Assad wasn't just any person,'' said Abeer, a gym teacher, 24,
who declined to give her last name because she said that praising
Assad would jeopardize her job as an Israeli public servant.
</P>
<P>
   She bristled at the Israeli education ministry officials who
forced her and other teachers to show up for work even though all
students were honoring a three-day strike in Assad's memory.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to feel like a person, that I have a country and a
president,'' she said in halting Hebrew, pointing to the televised
funeral procession. Her brother took a framed picture of Assad from
the closet and hung it on the balcony.
</P>
<P>
   Like many in Majdal Shams, Abeer studied in Damascus, where
Golan Druse get free tuition and a stipend for expenses, a gesture
from Assad that signified his claim to the Golan and its residents.
</P>
<P>
   Most Golan Druse refuse Israeli citizenship and pledge their
loyalty to Syria in demonstrations and public statements. They
describe their feelings over Assad's death with phrases similar to
those of mourners in Syria: ''I lost a father,'' ''I lost a piece
of my own flesh.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds held angry demonstrations Monday and Tuesday when
Israel denied most of them permission to cross into Syria for the
funeral. Syria also denied some Druse permission to cross.
</P>
<P>
   Some Druse residents, accustomed to the relatively free speech
allowed under Israel, criticized Assad and the dictatorship he
established.
</P>
<P>
   ''Syria can't continue the way it is now,'' said Yosef Safadi, a
dentist, 36, who said fear of retaliation if Syria regains the
Golan prevented other villagers from speaking against Assad or his
family.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's one of the most primitive countries in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Safadi is no sympathizer with Israel -- he respects Assad for
demanding that every inch of the Golan be returned to Syria, and he
hopes it happens soon.
</P>
<P>
   He fears however, that Assad's successor -- apparently his son
Bashar -- will continue his father's hard line, cracking down on
personal freedoms and maintaining the isolation that has stifled
Syria's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Safadi also dared to voice doubt that the 34-year-old heir could
hold onto power.
</P>
<P>
   Golan Druse find themselves caught between Israel, resented as a
foreign occupier, and a return to Syria that would likely end the
relative prosperity and freedom that 33 years of Israeli rule have
brought.
</P>
<P>
   Only a small percentage of Golan Druse hold Israeli citizenship
and an even smaller number collaborate with Israeli security
services.
</P>
<P>
   A minority both in Israel and Syria, members of the secretive
Druse religion that is an offshoot of Islam hope for the best.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bashar will definitely be more open than his father,'' Safadi
said. ''Because it's impossible to be more closed than his
father.''

<HEADLINE> Media Tycoon Arrested in Russia  </HEADLINE>
By JIM HEINTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Media tycoon Vladimir Gusinsky, whose holdings
include a TV station and newspapers that regularly criticize the
Kremlin over the Chechen war, civil rights and other issues, was
arrested Tuesday on charges of swindling and theft.
</P>
<P>
   Locked in a feud with President Vladimir Putin's administration
in recent months, Gusinsky has alleged the Kremlin is persecuting
him because it wants to crack down on independent news media. His
Media-Most holding company is one of Russia's largest media groups
and is widely considered the most outspoken.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky was taken into custody a month after investigators
backed by masked, gun-toting police raided Media-Most's offices. A
court later ruled the raid, which received widespread attention in
the West, was illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest caught the quick attention of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are quite concerned about some of the steps taken against
the free media,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky's lawyer, Pavel Astakhov, said the tycoon was called to
the prosecutor-general's office Tuesday for questioning related to
the raid and then arrested, the Interfax news agency reported. He
was being held in a Moscow prison, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   He is alleged to have participated in taking state property
worth at least $10 million, Russian news agencies said, citing a
statement by the prosecutor-general's office.
</P>
<P>
   It said Gusinsky's actions were done in concert with several
unidentified top officials of the Russian state television company
''Russian Video,'' based in St. Petersburg. NTV televison, one of
Gusinsky's companies, reported that ''Russian Video'' head Dmitry
Rozhdestventsky was charged with misappropriation of state funds in
1998 and has been in prison pending trial.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, on a state visit to Spain, said he had not known of the
arrest in advance and ''I hope the prosecutor's office has
sufficient grounds and everything was done in keeping with the
law,'' Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
   But Kirill Dibsky, deputy chief editor at the daily newspaper
Segodnya owned by Gusinsky's company, said ''It's an exclusively
political case.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said the raid last month was part of an
investigation into alleged violations of privacy law by the
company's security service. They claimed investigators found
evidence of eavesdropping on politicians, businessmen and
journalists, including bugging devices.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky has long experience in the rough-and-tumble world of
Russian business and politics, starting in the late 1980s when
economic reforms opened the way for entrepreneurs -- and for
questionable deals. Gusinsky emerged as one of the so-called
''Oligarchs'' -- a few men who amassed financial empires overnight
amid widespread allegations of the rigged privatization of state
property.
</P>
<P>
   He established the Most commercial bank in 1989, which snapped
up deteriorating buildings, renovated them and sold them at great
profit. In 1994, Russian media reported his staff was being
investigated on corruption allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Gusinsky alleged that Putin's chief of staff
Alexander Voloshin had offered him $100 million for his media not
to impede Putin in the presidential election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, elected president in March, has said he would work to
root out the corruption that has been endemic in Russia since the
collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But Boris Nemtsov, a leading reformist politician, said Tuesday
that the arrest sends a warning to all news media.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you don't behave you'll also end up in the slammer,'' he
said on ''Glas Naroda,'' (Voice of the People), a discussion show
on NTV television that aired two hours after the arrest was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   Media-Most's holdings include Segodnya, the radio station Ekho
Moskvy and the NTV television channel. NTV's satirical puppet show,
''Kukly,'' savages Putin and other top officials every week,
reportedly enraging some of the officials who are lampooned.
</P>
<P>
   The company's media are regarded as generally reliable, but in
Russia's highly charged media atmosphere, most publications and
broadcast outlets reflect the political stances of their owners.
</P>
<P>
   Another powerful media figure, Boris Berezovsky, commented
Tuesday on the arrest: ''There is no doubt that any person who did
business in Russia over the last 10 years broke the law, directly
or indirectly'' because the laws are confusing and frequently
changed, Interfax reported.

<HEADLINE> Singer Chesney Recalls Horse Ride  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Country singer Kenny Chesney said his
arrest for taking an unauthorized ride on a police horse after a
Buffalo-area concert was like a scene from the 1970s cop show
''Starsky and Hutch.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The guy in the driver's seat just slid over the hood, and they
started pulling me off,'' Chesney told Jay Leno on the ''Tonight
Show'' Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After his appearance in the music festival June 3, Chesney was
charged with disorderly conduct when he was pulled off a sheriff's
department horse backstage.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's officials said Chesney had permission to sit on the
horse but not to ride it away, and he refused orders to dismount.
</P>
<P>
   Chesney said he wanted to take the horse into the backstage bus
compound to show the other performers' children.
</P>
<P>
   Chesney's friend, singer Tim McGraw, was charged with
second-degree assault and resisting arrest after he allegedly tried
to pull police away from Chesney.
</P>
<P>
   The pair are scheduled to appear in court July 18.
</P>
<P>
   McGraw has been having his own fun with the incident. At the
tour's final stop in Houston Sunday, his wife, singer Faith Hill,
came on stage dressed as a law enforcement officer and led him off
in handcuffs.

<HEADLINE> Bobby Brown Sentenced To Jail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- A judge has sentenced Bobby Brown
to 75 days in jail for violating his probation for a drunken
driving conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just want to continue on with my sobriety and get back home
to my family,'' the singer told reporters after Monday's sentence.
''It's been really tough.''
</P>
<P>
   A prosecutor agreed to drop the most serious charge against
Brown, that he failed a drug test by testing positive for cocaine.
Brown agreed to plead guilty to refusing to take a second drug test
and failing to return from a trip to Beverly Hills, Calif., on
time.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has been in custody since May 10. He will remain in
Broward County Jail until July 8.
</P>
<P>
   Brown spent five days in jail in 1998 and was placed on
probation for one year after he was convicted of drunken driving
and causing an accident on Aug. 17, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A warrant was issued for Brown's arrest last June, after his
probation officer said he tested positive for cocaine in a urine
test.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Lyons, Brown's attorney, said Brown and wife Whitney
Houston should be able to spend their July 18 wedding anniversary --
their eighth -- together.
</P>
<P>
   The superstar singer has been absent from her husband's court
proceedings, but Lyons said she has visited him since his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ''She wants to help him, not hurt him. If she showed up today it
would have been a major zoo,'' Lyons said.

<HEADLINE> Gunman Who Shot the Pope Pardoned  </HEADLINE>
By ELLEN KNICKMEYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Italy pardoned the Turkish gunman Tuesday who tried
to kill Pope John Paul II in 1981, and he was believed to have been
immediately flown to a Turkish prison -- taking with him the answers
to the mysterious assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Mehmet Ali Agca, white-haired after his near two decades in
jail, was seen leaving the prison after dark Tuesday with nothing
but an armful of books. Authorities blocked journalists from the
Ancona airport, but he was believed to have left from there under
heavy guard on a night flight to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Turkey and Italy refused to immediately confirm
the extradition or give details of arrangements, citing security
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The pope had personally forgiven his would-be killer and Agca
profusely thanked the pontiff during a 1983 prison visit. The
Vatican recently reassured the government that John Paul supported
clemency for Agca.
</P>
<P>
   ''That the granting of pardon comes during Holy Year
celebrations makes the pope's personal satisfaction even more
intense,'' papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said.
</P>
<P>
   Agca must now serve time in Turkey for a killing that took place
before the attack on the pope.
</P>
<P>
   On May 13, 1981, Agca pulled a trigger twice as John Paul rode
smiling and waving in an open car through excited throngs of
pilgrims in St. Peter's Square.
</P>
<P>
   One shot hit the pope's abdomen, barely missing vital organs.
Doctors say the wound forever weakened the pope, then an athletic
hiker and skier, now a frail, stooped 80-year-old suffering from
symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   The former Soviet bloc was immediately suspected in the attack --
suspicions that lingered over the years despite denials by former
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and the onetime spy chief for
the former East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Soviet spy chiefs were seen as fearing the adamantly
anti-communist pope would spur popular revolts against the Soviet
bloc -- as John Paul in fact did, above all in his native Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Agca had told investigators he acted at the instigation of the
Bulgarian secret service and the Soviet KGB. But Italian courts
ruled there was insufficient evidence to support the accusations,
and Agca himself went on to give widely varying accounts over his
19 years and one month behind bars in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Agca purposefully feigned insanity in court to cast doubt on the
credibility of his own stories, a prosecutor said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This extinguishes the last hope of reaching the truth,''
prosecutor Antonio Marini said of the pardon and extradition.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Rosario Priore, who investigated the alleged
conspiracy between Bulgarian agents and Agca, agreed that the truth
has never emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Priore insisted, the pardon was the correct move.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the only possible act to take,'' Priore said. ''You can't
keep people in prison just to make them talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Agca, now 42, smiled in relief when Tuesday's news reached his
prison at Ancona, in eastern Italy, lawyer Marina Magistrelli said.
</P>
<P>
   '''It's a dream,''' Magistrelli quoted Agca as exclaiming,
saying he offered thanks to the pope, the Vatican and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul credits the Virgin Mary for sparing his life. The
Vatican said in May that the assassination attempt had been
foretold in a vision seen by three peasant children in Fatima,
Portugal, in 1917 -- the so-called third secret of Fatima.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after the shooting, cameras filmed the white-robed
pontiff visiting a clearly grateful Agca in prison. The heads of
gunman and victim alike were bowed in an intense conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Agca carried out the attack after escaping from prison in
Turkey, where he was being held in the killing of a Turkish
newspaper editor.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey later convicted him in absentia in the killing and
sentenced him to death. A 1991 amnesty reduced the sentence to 10
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   After expiration of that sentence -- minus 158 days served before
his escape -- Turkey will put Agca on trial in a 1979 robbery in
Istanbul, Turkish Justice Minister Hikmet Sami Turk said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wants to go to Turkey, pay his debt there like he did in
Italy and walk out a free man,'' Magistrelli, Agca's lawyer, said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'll be 50,'' she said. ''That's a whole life spent in
prison.''

<HEADLINE> Prescription Drug Imports Sought  </HEADLINE>
By FREDERIC J. FROMMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sponsors of legislation to allow imports of
federally approved drugs defended the proposal Tuesday against
critics who said such a move would jeopardize safety.
</P>
<P>
   Several bills have been introduced that would lift the U.S. ban
on pharmacists importing drugs from other countries, such as
Canada, where they are cheaper because of government price
controls.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we can import lettuce into this country, produced in
hundreds if not thousands of farms, certainly we can make sure that
the quality of (imported drugs) is of the standard that we want it
to be,'' Rep. Bernard Sanders, I-Vt., told the Senate Health,
Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.
</P>
<P>
   His comparison drew a challenge from the Senate's only
physician, committee member Bill Frist, R-Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lettuce importation into this country is different'' than a
drug used to treat a life-threatening illness, Frist said. ''If we
use the same standards that we use for importing lettuce into this
country, then I think we're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said his point was that if regulators could certify the
safety of food, they should be able to do the same for prescription
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say allowing imported drugs opens the door to safety
problems such as counterfeiting and tampering. Drugs also could
lose their effectiveness because of long delays in shipping.
</P>
<P>
   North Dakota Sen. Byron Dorgan, a Democrat who has sponsored
legislation similar to Sanders', said he would make any changes the
committee feels necessary to ensure safety. But he also noted the
safety argument comes mainly from a pharmaceutical industry
interested in keeping U.S. prices high.
</P>
<P>
   Dorgan, using pill bottles as a prop, said some medicines are
twice as expensive in the United States, forcing some poor
Americans to choose between food and health.
</P>
<P>
   ''My goal is to force the re-pricing of drugs in this country,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say Dorgan and others who support importation actually
want the federal government to create price controls.
</P>
<P>
   Alan F. Holmer, head of the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, the drug companies' trade group, noted
Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Jane Henney told Congress
earlier this year that she had safety concerns about imported
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   And he said any move toward government price controls would
chill the industry's innovative research and development efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Jim Jeffords, R-Vt., who also has sponsored
drug import legislation, questioned why Americans must ''bear all
of the burden of the research and development that benefits the
whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   Some committee members said they understood the reasons for the
legislation but wondered if it was the right solution.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., said the best way to address the
problem is through increased insurance coverage of prescription
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The drug industry is obviously an easy target,'' he said. ''I
don't want to see a solution that's more harmful than the
problem.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> AMA Rejects Execution Moratorium  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The American Medical Association on Tuesday
rejected a proposal for a moratorium on executions, instead calling
for ''appropriate medical forensic techniques'' to be used in
capital cases.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jonathan Weisbuch, author of the original resolution, had
asked the AMA to recommend to the National Governors' Association
that executions be halted until questions are answered regarding
the availability of DNA evidence and the quality of legal
representation for defendants facing the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is one of our tenets to do no harm,'' Weisbuch, public
health director for Maricopa County, Ariz., told the AMA's
550-member House of Delegates on Tuesday. He said that if doctors
do not work with the justice system to ensure capital cases do not
lead to wrongful convictions, ''we are not doing the work that we
should be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The AMA's delegates voted in favor of an amended resolution to
simply ''support the availability and use of all appropriate
medical forensic techniques in the criminal justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   The delegates at the AMA's annual meeting also endorsed a
procedure called ''surgical placebo controls,'' in which
participants in trials of a potential therapy might get incisions
or even holes drilled in their head even though only some would get
the actual treatment.
</P>
<P>
   It's a variation on traditional ''placebo controls'' studies, in
which one group of subjects gets a medication and results are
compared with members of a control group who receive a ''placebo''
or dummy pill.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in a recent University of Colorado study of the
effectiveness of transplanting fetal pig brain cells into the
brains of Parkinson's disease patients, holes were drilled in the
skulls of 40 patients but only half got the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The government has encouraged such research, but some ethicists
say the practice exposes human placebos to undue risks with no
benefits. The report adopted Tuesday acknowledges the risks but
says surgical placebo studies are justified if risks are made clear
to patients.
</P>
<P>
   The death penalty was characterized as a legal issue rather than
a medical one by several physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Calling for a moratorium ''presumes that there isn't a single
state in the nation that's doing the right thing,'' said Dr. Thomas
Price of Roswell, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   He said, for example, that ''Texas has done the right thing'' by
recently postponing the execution of an inmate who may be
exonerated by DNA evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven Thorson of Fort Collins, Colo., also told the
delegates that he feared a temporary halt would lead to a permanent
moratorium -- something he said wasn't the AMA's business.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion comes in the midst of a national debate over the
death penalty, heightened by Illinois Gov. George Ryan's moratorium
earlier this year after medical evidence exonerated several death
row inmates. The sponsors of the original resolution also noted a
recent Chicago Tribune report that questioned the reliability of
evidence in dozens of Texas executions during Gov. George W. Bush's
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The original resolution, drafted by the American Association of
Public Health Physicians, said ''the possibility exists that in
several states innocent individuals may be executed because medical
technology will not be made available in time to prevent their
death.''
</P>
<P>
   Its author, Weisbuch, said he considered Tuesday's vote a
partial victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm pleased with the fact that the AMA recognized ... that
there are people in this country that are being denied adequate
services in a capital punishment environment,'' he said. ''I was
disappointed personally that the association was unwilling to take
the next step.''

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Orphans Seek Refuge in US  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW ENGLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAKUMA, Kenya (AP) -- Sitting under a tree to escape the searing
midday heat, Barnabas Yel Atem contemplates what life might be like
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-year-old, who has crisscrossed East Africa on foot,
searching for a haven from war, is one of thousands of young
Sudanese men -- dubbed the ''Lost Boys'' by aid agencies -- who have
grown up as refugees, orphaned or separated from their families.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, Barnabas and 3,500 other Sudanese hope
to be in the United States as part of a resettlement program
established by the U.S. State Department and U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Still, after so many years on the run, Barnabas is skeptical.
''If we reach there, we will forget all these problems ... ,'' he
said, his voice trailing off, tinged with doubt.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Barnabas was among thousands of boys, some as young as
4 or 5, who fled Sudan's 17-year civil war, covering thousands of
miles on foot. Those who made it to neighboring Ethiopia thought
they had found stability. But in 1991, civil war broke out there,
too.
</P>
<P>
   They returned to Sudan, again on foot, but fighting forced them
south toward Kenya, where they ended up at Kakuma, 70 miles south
of the Sudanese border.
</P>
<P>
   ''The journeys were very bad,'' said Barnabas, whose father was
killed in fighting before he left for Ethiopia and whose mother had
died earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had no shoes and was thirsty and hungry, and we had to dodge
fighting -- many people died,'' he said. ''Moving from place to
place with such problems, we felt we could not exist in this
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting between southern-based rebels and government forces,
which began again in earnest in 1983, has left at least 2 million
Sudanese dead, mainly from war-induced famine, and forced 4 million
others from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The exact number of children who left Sudan for Ethiopia is not
known. But Julianne Duncan, a consultant with the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, said there could have been as many as
30,000.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the boys reached Kakuma, the number had dwindled to
12,000. According to Duncan, many were killed either in fighting,
or by wild animals, hunger or disease. Still others drowned while
crossing rivers.
</P>
<P>
   How the boys began the trek with little adult supervision or why
they congregated in Ethiopia remains a mystery. The boys say
everybody just scattered when their villages were attacked, and
there are stories of teachers or elder boys guiding them.
</P>
<P>
   But they stuck together, spending eight years at the U.N. camp
at Kakuma.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan said 5,000 of the original group of boys remain. While
some have gone back to Sudan, for the rest, returning is either too
dangerous or there is nothing to go back to.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after years of deciding what should be done with them, the
U.S. State Department and UNHCR have agreed to resettle about 3,500
young men over 18 in the United States, with the first group
scheduled to arrive by the end of the year, according to Preeta
Law, the UNHCR regional resettlement officer in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   They are to be resettled in regions where significant Sudanese
communities already exist, such as in Texas, Minnesota and North
and South Dakota. Church groups and other volunteer agencies,
working with U.S. government agencies, will help them with grants
and some social services to get started on their new life,
officials in Washington said.
</P>
<P>
   But after so many fruitless journeys, young refugees like
Barnabas still have to be persuaded that a brighter future beckons.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have heard about the resettlement program, but it was such a
long time ago I am discouraged,'' he said. ''I don't think it will
happen any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the United Nations seeks to resettle or repatriate
children within two years. However, Law acknowledged it has taken
far longer with the Lost Boys, partly because they were minors when
the process began and were unaccompanied by adults.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan blames the U.N. system, saying the organization too often
focused on emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of the conflict in Sudan, the world is not able to
solve this problem and the nature of U.N. bureaucracy has caused
this group of people to be raised in a refugee camp,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Kakuma, a dusty sprawling mass of mud huts which now holds
some 90,000 refugees from nine countries in the region, there is
little the Lost Boys can do except play checkers in the shade and
wait.
</P>
<P>
   ''The life here just depends on whatever I feel,'' said
21-year-old William Dhuor. ''Everyone has their own way of
thinking. Some think too much about living here or how to get their
parents. If something is not possible, I cannot put more effort
into that.''

<HEADLINE> Israel Hopes for Better Syria Ties  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The split screen was nothing out of the
ordinary: news anchor in the studio, onsite commentator describing
unfolding events.
</P>
<P>
   It was the captions that told the story: Jerusalem and Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   A small delegation of Israeli Arabs attended the funeral Tuesday
of Israel's longtime foe, Syrian President Hafez Assad. Israeli
officials hailed their presence -- and their unprecedented live
broadcasts to Israel -- as signals that Assad's son planned to
revive the collapsed peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although it is not a revolution, it is just one step toward
some kind of more normal relations between neighbors,'' Justice
Minister Yossi Beilin told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, officially in a state of war with Syria, was not invited
to send an official delegation. Most of the 14 Israeli Arabs in the
delegation had visited Syria before; but this was the first time
they crossed directly over the border between the Israeli-occupied
Golan Heights and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   And it was the first time they delivered live, high profile
reports to an Israeli broadcaster, the state-run Israel television.
Until now, Syria has banned any contact with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Damascus, which you can see behind me, is a beautiful city, a
noble city, a very historic city,'' legislator Mohammed Barakeh
told Israelis, sweeping his arm toward the panoramic backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   He and other interviewees spoke Hebrew -- a language that not
long ago was banned in Syria, even to Syrian Jews wanting to pray
in Judaism's liturgical tongue.
</P>
<P>
   In what was billed as a ''historic first live feed,'' legislator
Ahmed Tibi said the group was received warmly, and commented that
their easy passage into the country was a positive sign of
progress.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this is a sign of a Syrian society opening in the
direction of modernization and openness in all matters,'' he said.
''There is a desire of the Syrian new leadership of development,
advancement and looking ahead to a new, progressive future.''
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad is seen as a modernizer, and Israelis hope he will
moderate his father's views and reopen peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak told Israel television he hoped Bashar
''would bring Syria to openness with the world ... and peace in the
Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   Peace talks between the countries broke down in January because
of disagreements over the scope of Israel's territorial
concessions. Assad's son and designated heir, Bashar Assad, was
expected to focus on consolidating his power, making it unlikely
peace talks would resume anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Beilin, however, expressed hope that talks could resume sooner
with the help of American mediators. He said that after the
funeral, it would be appropriate to begin building contacts between
Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''It won't be too early tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow,''
Beilin said. ''It won't be easy, because usually a new regime wants
to establish itself first and wait a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ''But I'm not sure whether now we can afford to wait
too long, and whether it is going to serve the national interest of
Syria.''

<HEADLINE> Syria Bids Final Farewell to Assad  </HEADLINE>
By HAMZA HENDAWI
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- They sobbed and wailed. Some fainted
under the combined effect of grief and heat. Others climbed trees
and light poles to take a last look, or sought to ease their
anguish with softly whispered prayers.
</P>
<P>
   Syrians on Tuesday paid their last respects to Hafez Assad, the
man who ruled them with an iron grip for 30 years. Scores of world
leaders attended the funeral, which took a grueling 12 hours to
complete, beginning in the capital, Damascus, and ending 125 miles
to the northwest in Assad's home village of Qardaha.
</P>
<P>
   An enormous funeral procession snaked slowly through the streets
of the capital, bearing the body of the late president, the only
leader many in this isolated nation have ever known.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's body was then flown to the coastal city of Latakia,
where police struggled to keep the mourning crowds at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Throngs of men, women and children lined the 10-mile stretch of
road from Latakia to Qardaha, some of them having camped overnight
to ensure an unobstructed view of Assad's flag-draped coffin.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where are you going? Take us with you!'' shouted a woman
wearing a black robe and white head scarf. ''May God have mercy on
your soul,'' she said, as the last of a long convoy of cars
disappeared from sight and into Qardaha.
</P>
<P>
   Assad was buried in the village alongside his eldest son, Basil,
who had been Assad's first choice as successor before he died in a
1994 car crash.
</P>
<P>
   Mourners had begun trickling into Damascus at first light
Tuesday. A brass band played a funeral dirge as the procession
crawled slowly through the capital's streets.
</P>
<P>
   A sea of mourners walked the cortege route, shouting chants and
waving placards with portraits of Assad. A chain of presidential
guards and policemen linked hands to prevent people from flinging
themselves toward the coffin, which was borne by a gun carriage and
covered in the black, red and white Syrian flag.
</P>
<P>
   At one point mourners, overcome with grief, attempted to break
through the security cordon. The troops pushed them back, but not
before the mourners brought down part of a concrete fence.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral was carried live on Syrian TV and throughout much of
the Middle East on other Arab channels.
</P>
<P>
   Many mourners arrived in organized groups, with union colleagues
and office co-workers joining in the ceremonies together. Each
group marched in turn around a traffic circle, chanting at the
command of a group leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''We dedicate our lives to the president!'' they cried.

<HEADLINE> Coaches Urged To Back Gambling Ban  </HEADLINE>
By BART JANSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kentucky basketball coach Tubby Smith and
South Carolina football coach Lou Holtz urged Congress to end legal
betting on amateur sports, saying it has helped create a world
where point spreads matter as much as wins and losses.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony Tuesday before the House Judiciary Committee, the
coaches said players are tempted to throw games or shave points so
the final score is within the spread.
</P>
<P>
   Holtz, who coached Notre Dame to the national championship in
1988, said he has had teams cheered and booed for winning.
</P>
<P>
   ''The difference was the point spread,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who coached Kentucky to a national championship in 1998,
said point spreads have become part of the sports landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hits home because I remember my wife one day saying,
'Tubby, we should be OK tonight because the line says we're going
to win.' She never gambled in her life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have people come into my office and say, 'Tubby, you're just
not winning by enough.' I see it all over.''
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers and gambling interests from Nevada -- the only
state offering legal betting on amateur sports -- say the criticism
is misdirected.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not believe a bill banning college sports gambling in
Nevada will eliminate or significantly reduce gambling on college
sports,'' said Bobby Siller, a Nevada Gaming Control Board member
and former FBI agent who investigated gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of legal sports betting in Nevada is $2.3 billion a
year, with about $650 million on college sports. Illegal sports
gambling has been estimated at $80 billion to $380 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Gibbons, R-Nev., argued there is no evidence that legal
gambling in his state is ''in any way responsible for the illegal
sports wagering that plagues our nation's college campuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Shelley Berkley, D-Nev., said eliminating legal bets in
Nevada won't solve the problem any more than ''suggesting that
outlawing aspirin would stop the sale of illegal drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The House bill, sponsored by Reps. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and
Tim Roemer, D-Ind., would ban all gambling on amateur athletic
events, such as college sports and the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Commerce Committee already approved a similar bill
and a vote in the full Senate could come this week, as an amendment
to the defense authorization bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''I simply think that we should not gamble with the integrity of
our colleges or the future of our college athletes,'' said Sen. Sam
Brownback, R-Kan., who sponsored the bill with Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz. ''Our young athletes deserve legal protection from the
seedy influences of gambling.''
</P>
<P>
   Scandals at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., and
Arizona State, among others in recent years, spurred legislative
action to close the door on legal gambling on amateur athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly what you've read about over the last decade is just
the tip of the iceberg,'' said James Delaney, commissioner of the
Big Ten Conference.
</P>
<P>
   College officials acknowledge gambling is a problem on campuses,
whether its students placing bets or taking them.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are the kinds of things that worry us greatly because of
the threat they pose to the integrity of our programs,'' said
Graham Spanier, president of Pennsylvania State University.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Jerry Hall To Play Mrs. Robinson  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Jerry Hall is getting ready to bare all on stage.
</P>
<P>
   The model and ex-wife of Mick Jagger has been tapped to replace
Kathleen Turner in the West End production of ''The Graduate,'' the
Gielgud Theater announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Turner steps aside on July 29. After that, Hall will take over
the role of the seductress Mrs. Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   The play, which has set box-office records despite lukewarm
reviews, is expected to be extended until the end of the year.
Adapted from the 1967 film starring Dustin Hoffman and Anne
Bancroft, it has attracted bountiful publicity for a brief scene in
which Turner appears naked onstage.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, 43, is expected to also appear nude.
</P>
<P>
   Hall and Jagger divorced last year. The couple have four

<P>
   BLOOMFIELD, N.J. (AP) -- An Italian-American group has given the
producer of the HBO series ''The Sopranos'' its ''Pasta-tute''
award for ''selling out his Italian culture and heritage in the
media.''
</P>
<P>
   The Italian-American One Voice Committee said ''Sopranos''
producer David Chase was chosen by nearly a 2-to-1 margin over the
closest challenger.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has created a fiction and brought it right into real
neighborhoods, horribly degrading our image,'' committee chairman
Manny Alfano said Monday. ''He has used existing prejudice as a
foundation to support his fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Sopranos'' is a critically acclaimed and award-winning
series about a fictional crime family set in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   HBO spokesman Chris Donlay declined comment on the
''Pasta-tute'' award or the group's criticism of the show.
</P>
<P>
   The group said Chase was selected over singer Jerry Vale, who
drew the group's ire for his compact disc entitled ''Mob Hits.''

<HEADLINE> Los Alamos Nuclear Secrets Missing  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Tuesday
he's ''outraged'' at the latest security lapse at the Los Alamos
weapons lab, but that he doubts espionage or theft was involved in
the loss of top-secret computer drives that contain nuclear
secrets, saying they likely were misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of the drives, which contained information
about how to dismantle both U.S. and Russian nuclear devices,
prompted sharp criticism in Congress and a call for renewed
hearings on security in the Energy Department's nuclear programs,
especially the weapons labs.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, who spent most of last year defusing a security flap
involving fired Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee, came under sharp
criticism Tuesday for the latest incident, although he apparently
didn't know about it until a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''This incident occurred on his watch. He'll have to be held
accountable,'' said Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Armed
Services Committee. Warner said his committee planned a hearing
Thursday on the missing nuclear material and both Richardson and
Los Alamos lab director John Browne were to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said he was ''outraged by the security lapses that
have taken place'' and that he expects some officials at Los Alamos
to be disciplined, possibly within days, for not notifying the
Energy Department promptly about the missing computer drives.
</P>
<P>
   The drives were found missing from a metal container in a highly
secure vault in the Los Alamos lab's ''X Division'' complex where
nuclear bomb designers work. The discovery was made late in the
evening on May 7 as scientists sought to secure them from a massive
wildfire threatening the lab complex. Energy Department officials
did not learn of the disappearance for 24 days, until June 1.
</P>
<P>
   During that time both Richardson and his top ''security czar,''
retired Air Force Gen. Eugene Habiger, flew to Los Alamos because
of the wildfires. Neither, however, was given a hint that nuclear
secrets may have been compromised, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm most concerned about the failure of the lab to promptly
notify ... when these potential (security) breaches took place. ...
The lab is going to have to have some good explanations,''
Richardson told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The two drives, about the size of a deck of cards and each
containing identical information, were used by the Nuclear
Emergency Search Team, or NEST, which is trained to respond to
nuclear accidents or terrorist acts. The drives, which can be used
in a laptop computer, contain highly technical nuclear weapons data
needed to disarm and dismantle nuclear devices.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of such sensitive top-secret nuclear files
opened the way Tuesday for renewed attacks from Republicans in
Congress on the Clinton administration's safeguarding of nuclear
materials -- an issue that dominated much of last year amid
criticism that the administration botched an investigation at Los
Alamos into the alleged loss of nuclear secrets to China in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   A Los Alamos scientist, Wen Ho Lee, had for three years been
suspected of giving information about nuclear warheads to China,
although no evidence has ever surfaced linking him to any
espionage. Lee, fired from Los Alamos in March, 1999, was arrested
last December and charged with illegally copying secret computer
files. The files have never been found and he is awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest security matter, Richardson said Tuesday he doubts
that espionage or theft was involved and that his security and
counterintelligence experts ''believe that these drives have been
misplaced'' during the ''strain and confusion'' caused by last
month's wildfires that destroyed thousands of acres and hundreds of
homes in Los Alamos, threatening the lab itself.
</P>
<P>
   But some lawmakers are not as convinced.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., a member of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, said there was ''physical evidence to suggest theft,''
but he declined to elaborate. Kyl, a sharp critic of DOE's security
of nuclear materials, called the lost computer drives an
''unacceptable security breach.''
</P>
<P>
   Habiger, tapped last year by Richardson to be the department's
''security czar,'' said Tuesday only 26 people had authority to
enter the vault where the missing drives were kept so that on
moments notice they could be available to the nuclear weapons
response teams.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are dedicated loyal Americans,'' Habiger told a House
Commerce subcommittee hearing, adding that in his judgment the
missing data likely was lost or misplaced, and not stolen. Habiger
led the weeklong search and investigation at Los Alamos last week
after DOE was notified of the missing material.

<HEADLINE> RETRANSMITTING TO INCLUDE NOTE THIS IS VERSION FOR AMS  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Two days after a roving mob terrorized at least
10 women - including four tourists - in Central Park, questions
arose Tuesday about how authorities handled the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Two victims said police were slow to respond to their cries.
Ironically, more than 900 officers were assigned to patrol the park
that day because of a parade on adjacent Fifth Avenue. On a normal
Sunday, 36 officers patrol the 840-acre park.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard
Safir brushed off the incidents as ''isolated.'' On Tuesday, their
tone softened.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very concerned about the women who got assaulted, maybe
more than you, because I feel responsible,'' Giuliani told
reporters. ''We regret very much that this has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes some sick, crazy criminal or drunk kids do sick
things,'' said Giuliani. He added that the ''sick and shocking and
horrible'' incidents will be investigated ''with tremendous
enthusiasm and enormous force.''
</P>
<P>
   The incidents involved men spraying water on women, tearing at
their clothes, groping them and, in some cases, robbing them.
Although perhaps as many as 20 to 40 men took part, only two were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   At their bail hearing Tuesday, prosecutors related the ordeal of
an 18-year-old British tourist. She and her friends were surrounded
and soaked with water; men tore at her shirt and ripped off her
shorts; hands violated her private areas. Then the men were gone,
fleeing into crowds of people in the park seeking relief from the
90-degree weather.
</P>
<P>
   The woman quickly found two cops who helped her search for her
attackers. Minutes later, two men were arrested: the wrong men,
defense lawyers claim.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt that they were under a lot of pressure to arrest
somebody,'' said David Kapner, attorney for David Rowe, 24, of
Hempstead, on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting incidents and murders are is on the rise in the city, a
contrast to dramatic declines in the 1990s. Relatively little crime
has occurred this year in Central Park, but that was no comfort for
victims of Sunday's rampage.
</P>
<P>
   Peyton Bryant, 29, a kickboxing teacher in Manhattan, was
in-line skating near Central Park South and Sixth Avenue when the
group of men set upon her, trying to pull down her pants. Bryant
struggled and the men ran off.
</P>
<P>
   ''I skated over to an officer and told him I was attacked and
that the crowd was out of control,'' Bryant said. ''I told him I
was assaulted, but he acted like it was nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant approached two other officers who told her to file a
report at the Midtown North Precinct. She did, but no one offered
to help her look for her attackers, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman, the mother of one of two Long Island teen-agers
attacked, said police also ignored her daughter's cries. They only
pointed to an ambulance parked nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Police are conducting an internal investigation into the
complaints, and Giuliani said if the allegations are true, the
officers will be ''severely disciplined.'' The mayor offered a
$10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction
of any of the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   All the attacks occurred during a short span of time, around 6
p.m. and in the southern portion of the park, near the zoo and the
Plaza Hotel. Among the victims were a French couple on their
honeymoon, the three British tourists, and an Associated Press
reporter and her friend.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Safir said police officers were not nearby
when the specific incidents occurred.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, police were working with several television stations
to obtain amateur videotape of the attacks that was aired during
Monday and Tuesday newscasts. Police hope to identify some of the
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Ludwig, attorney for defendant Tremayne Bain, 23, of
Brooklyn, said the group his client and Rowe were with have given a
videotape to police that shows the defendants were not involved in
the attacks. Police did not immediately comment on Ludwig's
assertions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tape corroborates the fact that they were about 150 yards
away when the attack (on the British tourists) took place,'' Ludwig
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rowe, and Bain were charged with second-degree aggravated sexual
abuse, first-degree sexual abuse and second-degree robbery. Bail
was set at $10,000 for each, and both were still in jail Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man said anything during the brief hearing, and they did
not enter pleas. They are due back in court Friday. Rowe and Bain,
who are friends, had come into Manhattan to watch the Puerto Rican
Day parade, Kapner added.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the attacks, Central Park was crowded as usual on Monday
and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Central Park is my oasis away from the big city,'' said Claire
Duane, 34, of Manhattan. ''We can't let thugs like this take away
our refuge, our sense of well-being.''

<HEADLINE> De La Rua Apologizes for Nazi Role  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY DUNPHY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Fernando de la Rua of Argentina
apologized ''with a deep feeling of pain'' Tuesday for his
country's role in providing sanctuary to Nazis after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He promised that his government will investigate how Nazis were
allowed to enter Argentina after World War II and punish anyone who
committed crimes and may still be at large.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to how Nazis were smuggled in or received visas, de la
Rua said, ''I apologize that this was allowed to happen. ... This
we regret with a deep feeling of pain.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was important for present and future generations to
publicize these events ''to avoid any repetition, to prevent other
forms of xenophobia and racism from taking root.''
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua said he had apologized twice before for the sanctuary
his country offered Nazis, ''but it is important to repeat it and
express solidarity with the victims of the Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington representative of the World Jewish Congress,
Douglas Bloomfield, listened to de la Rua's statement and called it
''commendable and very important.''
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua said the apology was appropriate because ''Nazi war
criminals took advantage of an opportunity to find shelter in
Argentina'' as some consular officials were making it difficult for
Jews to get visas.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is my regret,'' de la Rua said a news conference in a
hotel near the White House. ''A commission has been created to open
all Nazi files and find the truth, and its work will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 25-minute meeting with Clinton in the Oval Office and a
working lunch, the two presidents discussed strengthening
democracy, recent presidential elections in Peru, drug trafficking
in Colombia, telecommunications, trade and economic issues in
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   During de la Rua's visit, officials from the two nations will
sign four agreements. They would permit criminal extradition,
strengthen anti-corruption efforts in Argentina, enhance
environmental preservation in Argentina's national parks and expand
existing scientific cooperation on satellites.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the main points the president wanted to raise with de
la Rua is that Argentina is taking an increasing role in
peacekeeping, which we welcome,'' said Mike Hammer, a White House
spokesman. ''We want to work with Argentina in terms of promoting
democracy and encourage de la Rua in his economic efforts in
putting Argentina on track.''
</P>
<P>
   The Argentine leader also said investigators again will probe
the 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires and an
attack two years later on a Jewish community center in the
Argentine capital.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy bombing killed 29 people, and 86 died in the attack
on the center.
</P>
<P>
   ''We plan to find out the truth and want justice to be done,''
de la Rua said.
</P>
<P>
   After the Clinton meeting, de la Rua toured the U.S. Holocaust
Memorial Museum for 45 minutes and met museum director Sara
Bloomfield in the glass-ceilinged Hall of Witness. Bloomfield led
him through several exhibits including a replica of a boxcar, such
as the Nazis used to transport Jews to concentration camps, and an
area devoted to ghetto uprisings.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is very impressive. It is bigger than the one we have in
Buenos Aires,'' said Fernando de la Rua. ''It is most important to
preserve the memory of this tragedy so we can avoid it happening
again.''
</P>
<P>
   In Buenos Aires recently, de la Rua said, he hosted a luncheon
at his residence in honor of Holocaust survivors.
</P>
<P>
   At a speech last month to mark the 57th anniversary of the April
19-May 16, 1943, Warsaw Uprising by Jews, de la Rua said Argentina
had to come to grips with its past, which included harboring wanted
Nazi war criminals for decades.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, Israeli agents abducted Adolph Eichmann, a chief
architect of the Holocaust, from his hide-out in Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1998, Argentine authorities arrested Dinko Sakic,
one-time commander at Croatia's Jasenovac concentration camp, who
had been living peacefully in Argentina. He was extradited to
Croatia, where last year he was sentenced to 20 years in prison for
war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the number of Jews who vanished during that period
range as high as 2,000, and Israel has asked the de la Rua
government to investigate. Argentina is home to about 300,000 Jews,
the second largest Jewish community in the Americas.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia: Peace Plan Needs Review  </HEADLINE>
By ABEBE ANDUALEM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) -- Fighting with Eritrea has subsided
in the Horn of Africa war after three days of heavy clashes,
Ethiopia said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Government spokeswoman Selome Taddesse said only minor
skirmishes were reported at the eastern Bure front, 25 miles from
the Eritrean port city of Assab. The spokeswoman's claims could not
be independently confirmed, nor was there any word on the progress
of fighting in western Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
   Most fighting on the eastern and western fronts occurs during
the late afternoon because of the searing heat, which regularly
reaches 122 degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia said Monday that its army was advancing toward the key
western town of Teseney, which Eritrean forces retook in a fierce
12-hour battle last week.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Eritrean troops have been killed, wounded or
captured during the latest offensive, said a statement issued
Monday by the Ethiopian government. Ethiopia on Sunday recaptured
Guluj, 20 miles south of Teseney, and has seized key positions
between the two towns, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Eritrean capital, Asmara, there was no comment on the
Ethiopian claims.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin arrived
back in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, following two weeks of
peace talks in Algiers brokered by the Organization of African
Unity. He was to brief Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and other
Ethiopian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia announced Saturday it had agreed in principle with an
OAU-drafted peace plan. A day later, however, Selome said the
proposals had to be discussed by the country's leaders because they
involved ''such major issues as territorial integrity and
sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   The OAU has given Ethiopia until this weekend to accept or
reject the peace plan, which calls for a cease-fire, U.N.
peacekeepers to monitor the border and outside demarcation of the
contested Ethiopian-Eritrean border.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia launched an offensive against Eritrea on May 12,
re-igniting a war that has already cost the lives of thousands of
soldiers and civilians on both sides. The latest round of fighting
has displaced up to 1 million Eritreans, according to international
aid agencies in Asmara.
</P>
<P>
   In the Eritrean capital, the U.N. World Food Program said
Tuesday there was enough emergency food in Eritrea to sustain the
country for two months, but not enough trucks to transport the food
to the hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Rowe, a WFP spokesman, said the agency was preparing a
$60 million aid request to donors, including an appeal for funds to
purchase 35 trucks.

<HEADLINE> Mother gives up baby in innovative program to protect infants  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TROY, N.Y. (AP) - A 20-year-old mother who gave birth to a boy
tried to give him something more hours later: a better life.
</P>
<P>
   In an innovative program, the mother gave up her child under a
program aimed at encouraging parents to turn over their newborns in
a ''safe haven'' rather than risk neglect or death as in some
recent cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't know what to do. They're in a panic,'' said
Rensselaer County District Attorney Kenneth Bruno in a news
conference Tuesday after the child was turned over to county
authorities. ''This is the thing to do. It's the only responsible
thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day the state Senate run by Bruno's father,
Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, R-Brunswick, unanimously
approved a bill that would do much the same thing as the county
program. Those who abandon newborns in safe settings like hospitals
wouldn't face prosecution. The bill comes after reports of a few
distraught young mothers who abandoned babies in trash bins partly
out of fear of arrest or other problems.
</P>
<P>
   The baby was born in Troy at 11:30 a.m. in Seton Health-St.
Mary's Hospital. Under the county program, a mother can give up
most rights to a child within 72 hours of birth anonymously if the
mother chooses. From there, county social services workers took
over. The child would then enter the foster care system and become
available for adoption, Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
   If the mother later protests, saying the decision was made under
the duress after giving birth, she can seek custody of the child.
But at that point, the decision would be made the county Department
of Social Services.
</P>
<P>
   In May, prosecutors, hospital administrators and social service
officials from nine counties around Albany unveiled Project Safe
Haven.

<HEADLINE> US Backs Nigeria Debt Relief  </HEADLINE>
By GILBERT DA COSTA
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- The United States will support debt relief
for Nigeria, where the restoration of civilian rule has created a
''window of opportunity,'' Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Summers, who concluded a two-day visit to the impoverished West
African nation on Monday, said the United States would back
''generous'' debt rescheduling this year by the Paris Club of donor
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Provided Nigeria makes ''significant progress on meaningful
financial and economic reforms,'' the United States would in
subsequent years urge the international financial community to
reduce the country's $30 billion foreign debt, Summers said. Among
the Nigerian reforms sought by the United States is budget
reallocation to ensure that savings from debt relief would be
channeled into education and health.
</P>
<P>
   Summers also noted the need to move ahead with Nigeria's planned
privatization of state assets and to establish the rule of law in a
nation where ethnic and religious fighting is endemic and
corruption is rife.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nigeria's economic challenges are very great,'' Summers said.
''But I believe the democratic opportunity Nigeria now has provides
the best window of opportunity Nigeria has enjoyed in many years.''
</P>
<P>
   President Olusegun Obasanjo's election last year ended 15 years
of military rule in Nigeria, which remains desperately poor despite
the country's status as the world's sixth-largest oil producer.
</P>
<P>
   Summers met with Obasanjo as well as the central bank governor
and other top officials while in Abuja.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was encouraged by the indications that the president and the
vice president gave with regard to their policy intentions, but
what is going to be crucial is their effectiveness in carrying
through those policies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Summers left Monday for Tanzania, the next leg of an African
tour which will also take in South Africa, Mozambique and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   He cut short his planned three-day Nigeria visit to let
government and labor leaders meet. The two sides were working to
resolve a five-day national strike touched off by climbing fuel
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders called off the work stoppage Tuesday after the
government reduced a 50 percent hike in the cost of petroleum
products.

<HEADLINE> Man freed 23 years after doctor's murder angry, bitter, and thankful </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLIFTON, N.J. (AP) - For the second time in his life, Lawrence
Simmons has had murder charges against him dropped.
</P>
<P>
   But after spending 23 years behind bars for a killing he insists
he didn't commit, Simmons is angry, bitter, and thankful the
justice system he once scorned has freed him.
</P>
<P>
   The 43-year-old Paterson man was released Monday after the
Passaic County Prosecutor's Office declined to seek a fourth trial
in the 1977 beating death of Dr. David Doktor, a prominent Paterson
physician who was on his way to an emergency call.
</P>
<P>
   An appeals court overturned Simmons' murder conviction in 1995,
and two subsequent trials ended in hung juries. The prosecutor's
office declined to try him again, saying he had already served more
time in prison than he could get at sentencing if convicted again.
</P>
<P>
   He remained in custody on $500,000 bail since then, and was also
serving a 15-year term for an unrelated mugging that occurred the
same night as the doctor's killing. Simmons says he's innocent of
that crime, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want the public to know that Lawrence Simmons did not and
would not kill or take the life of another human being,'' Simmons
said at a news conference flanked by relatives at his lawyers'
office. ''It's not in me. I want the doctor's family to know I am
innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand their anger. Just like the doctor's family are
victims, I am a victim, too,'' Simmons said. ''I spent 23 years in
jail for a crime I did not commit. I lost a lot of family members
and friends who passed away without the chance to say goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his lawyers would not say if he plans civil litigation
against anyone regarding the case.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons spent his first night of freedom meeting nieces and
nephews who were born while he was behind bars, and eating a dinner
of chicken, macaroni salad and potatoes his 70-year-old mother,
Louvenia Simmons, made for him.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons previously worked as a welder, and learned how to strip
floors while in prison, but does not know what he wants to do for a
living now that he's free.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm gonna work not one, but two jobs,'' he said. ''I have a
lot of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons saved most of his anger for the state's star witness in
the crime, David R. Wilson, who got immunity in the case and
testified against him, only to later recant his testimony. Wilson
is currently in jail on unrelated charges, as is co-defendant
Donald Phillips, said Simmons' lawyer, Miles Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson admitted acting as the lookout during the attack, and
testified that Simmons kicked and punched the doctor and ripped the
wallet from his pocket as Phillips beat the doctor with a pipe.
</P>
<P>
   But Simmons said his clothing, including his shoes, had no blood
on them, while the other two men were covered with blood and one
was wearing the doctor's hat at the time of his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons said he was at his sister Wanda's house when the doctor
was killed. Steven Brizek, Passaic County's senior assistant
prosecutor who handled two of Simmons' trials in the Doktor case,
noted that Simmons' sister lived with Phillips, adding the men had
ample time to have committed the killing that night.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons said he suspects police wanted to implicate him in
Doktor's killing because previous murder charges against Simmons
involving the death of his brother were dropped by an appeals
court.
</P>
<P>
   He said his brother, Morris Addison, was killed by a police
officer in Paterson in 1974, and police charged Simmons with felony
murder in connection with his death. He said he believes
investigators told Wilson, ''Lawrence Simmons got away with murder
once,'' and influenced Wilson to implicate him in Doktor's killing.
</P>
<P>
   Brizek said Simmons and two accomplices had robbed a milk store
and were fleeing when police shot his brother. Brizek said the
felony murder conviction was reversed after judges ruled that an
accomplice cannot be charged with murder in such a situation, but
noted that assault and robbery charges were allowed to stand.
</P>
<P>
   He said Simmons had ample time to come forward with allegations
of police misconduct in the investigation since 1977, but chose not
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court overturned Simmons' murder conviction in 1995
because some transcripts of jury selection proceedings were
missing, and were needed to determine whether racial bias played a
role in the composition of the jury, which was predominantly white,
Feinstein said. Simmons is black.
</P>
<P>
   ''If one combs the record, one will not find a single jury which
has unanimously concluded that Lawrence Simmons is not guilty of
murdering Dr. Doktor,'' Brizek told a judge Monday before agreeing
not to seek a fourth trial. In his 1996 retrial, the vote was
8-to-4 for conviction. In 1998, it was 9-to-3 for conviction.
</P>
<P>
   He said people should focus on the 64-year-old Doktor, who was
answering a telephone call in the middle of the night, asking him
to substitute for another doctor who couldn't make it to a hospital
to care for an elderly woman who had just suffered a stroke, when
he was attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let us remember that in that precious moment when all of his
attention was focused on saving a life, his was taken from him,''
Brizek told the judge.

<HEADLINE> ABC Clips to 3rd Place on Nielsen  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Riding the instant success of ''Survivor,'' CBS
had a solid week in the prime-time television ratings and ABC
learned how far it could sink when it has to pre-empt Regis
Philbin.
</P>
<P>
   With 18 million viewers, more people watched the strangers
testing their survival skills on a rat-infested island last week
than tuned in to any of the first three games of the NBA Finals,
Nielsen Media Research said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor'' even beat ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' in
head-to-head competition on June 7.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, the season's ratings leader, slipped to third place for the
week, primarily because it devoted three nights of prime-time to
the Stanley Cup hockey finals between Dallas and New Jersey. It was
the network's worst week since December, before ''Millionaire''
joined the regular schedule.
</P>
<P>
   By hockey's standards, the matchup did well: Thursday night's
long, tense overtime struggle drew the highest household ratings
for a Stanley Cup finals game in 20 years, according to ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Thursday's average audience for the hockey game was less
than a quarter of what ABC could have expected from ''Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's highest-rated show of the week was its concert special
with Britney Spears from Hawaii. Its effort at duplicating ABC's
game show success with ''Chance of a Lifetime'' fell flat, however.
</P>
<P>
   NBC had a respectable showing with its summer series,
''M.Y.O.B.,'' while ABC cancelled its poor-performing ''Clerks''
after two showings.
</P>
<P>
   NBC averaged 10.66 million viewers in prime-time last week,
narrowly edging CBS' 10.61 million viewers. CBS' ratings were
slightly higher (7.6 rating, 14 share) than NBC's (7.5, 14), which
indicates that more CBS viewers were watching alone.
</P>
<P>
   ABC had 9.3 million viewers on average (6.3 rating, 11 share),
Fox had 6.4 million viewers (4.3, 8), UPN had 3.7 million (2.4, 4
share), the WB had 2.4 million (1.7, 3) and Pax TV had 1.2 million
(0.9, 2).
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ''Nightly News'' dominated the evening news ratings race
with 9.4 million viewers (7.0 rating, 16 share). ABC's ''World News
Tonight'' had 8.1 million viewers (6.0, 14), and the ''CBS Evening
News'' had 7.4 million viewers (5.8, 13).
</P>
<P>
   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
   For the week of June 5-11, the top 10 shows, their networks and
ratings were:
</P>
<P>
   ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Sunday), ABC, 16.3; ''Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Tuesday), ABC, 15.8; ''Survivor,''
CBS, 11.7; ''48 Hours'' (Monday), CBS, 11.2; ''NBA Finals Game 3:
L.A. Lakers at Indiana,'' NBC, 10.7; ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' (Wednesday), ABC, 10.6; ''NBA Finals Game 1: Indiana
at L.A. Lakers,'' NBC, 10.5; ''Everybody Loves Raymond,'' CBS,
10.3; ''60 Minutes,'' CBS, 10.1; ''NBA Finals Game 2: Indiana at
L.A. Lakers,'' NBC, 9.9.

<HEADLINE> Type O Patients Pose Medical Irony  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The United Network for Organ Sharing is considering
changes in
transplant policies for type O livers, but not for other organs.
The current and proposed policies for livers, and the standing
policies for lungs, hearts and kidneys:
<TEXT>
<P>
   --Livers:
</P>
<P>
   Current policy: Prohibits transplanting O livers into patients
with other blood types who are the least sick -- those classified as
status 2b or 3. Allows transplanting O livers to non-O patients who
are the most sick -- those classified as status 1 and 2a.
</P>
<P>
   Proposed policy: Would not change the rules for patients in
status 1, 2b or 3. For status 2a -- patients who are sick enough to
be in the hospital but do not face imminent death -- O livers would
not be transplanted into patients with blood types A or AB.
Patients with blood type B, which is quite rare, could still get
type O livers.
</P>
<P>
   --Lungs: Type O organs are strictly reserved for type O patients.
</P>
<P>
   --Hearts: Type O organs are directed to type O patients first,
but only within the sickness category. So a sicker patient with a
different blood type would get a heart before a less-sick O
patient.
</P>
<P>
   --Kidneys: Type O organs only go to O patients -- unless there's a
perfect tissue match with someone of another blood type. (Kidneys
are the only organs that rely on tissue typing in addition to blood
type for placement.)

<HEADLINE> 31 charged in marriage fraud ring  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A ring that found American wives for
Pakistani men looking for U.S. residency was broken up Tuesday with
the indictment of 31 people on marriage fraud, federal authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials identified 28 fraudulent marriages linked
to the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Among those charged were 17 men from Pakistan, seven American
citizen ''wives'' and seven people who allegedly helped arranged
the marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our two-year investigation culminated in the dismantling of
the largest fraud ring we've ever seen in the Buffalo district,''
Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner
said.
</P>
<P>
   The women were paid to marry the men and the couples would not
live together after marriage. The wives would file for divorce once
their husbands received permanent residency cards, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This investigation shows the ends to which foreign nationals
desiring American citizenship will go to attain it,'' U.S. Attorney
Denise O'Donnell said. ''It is deeply disturbing that U.S. citizens
are so willing to further these illegal schemes by entering into
sham marriages and lying under oath to government authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation also led to charges of food-stamp trafficking
against six individuals, including two allegedly involved in the
marriage scheme. Authorities said the defendants were either owners
or employees of Rochester convenience stores and purchased $177,985
in food stamps for $65,150 between May 1999 and June 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Those charged in the marriage fraud ring could face prison
sentences of up to 10 years if convicted. Food stamp fraud carries
a maximum prison term of five years.

<HEADLINE> Woody Allen wins as landmarks panel rejects East Side apartment tower </HEADLINE>
By KAREN MATTHEWS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Woody Allen scored a hit in his off-screen role
as a neighborhood defender Tuesday when the city Landmarks
Preservation Commission rejected a 17-story building he had
opposed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very pleasantly surprised,'' Allen said after the
11-member commission unanimously turned down the proposed apartment
tower on Madison Avenue in the Carnegie Hill Historic District.
''I'm so used to losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen testified against the project in February and distributed
a 3-minute video to commission members.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've tried to make New York City look like the most beautiful
and the warmest, the most romantic city in the world, and to some
degree I've succeeded,'' he said then. ''Invariably when I'm
filming, I come to Carnegie Hill to film because there are very few
areas anywhere on the island where I can really present the city in
the way that I want to world to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said on Tuesday that he was pessimistic about preservation
battles but ''if you love the city you really have to try all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When I made the movie 'Manhattan' we went over the city and
shot in many, many places and had quite a few good vistas,'' Allen
said. ''Now a lot of those vistas don't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of Allen's East Side neighbors cheered when commission
Chairwoman Jennifer Raab called the proposed Madison Avenue
building too tall for the site and said it ''should not and will
not be approved.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen stood silently in the back of the City Hall hearing room,
not cracking a smile.
</P>
<P>
   He thanked the commission afterward, saying it ''really did act
with enormous responsibility not just to the people of Carnegie
Hill but to the entire city, everyone who lives here.''
</P>
<P>
   Developer Cary Tamarkin said in a prepared statement: ''I
respect the views articulated by the members of the commission, and
I look forward to working with the commission and members of the
community in the months ahead as we develop a new design for the
building.''

<HEADLINE> Attack came out of nowhere  </HEADLINE>
By DEEPTI HAJELA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The water came out of nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of guys with what looked like water bottles started
splashing me, catching me on my arms, my back, my side. I kept
turning to get away, and moving toward the Central Park South exit,
assuming my friend Stephanie was right behind me.
</P>
<P>
   It was hot and sticky Sunday, so the first splash was actually
kind of cooling. I was annoyed, but not really angry.
</P>
<P>
   But the guys started aiming at my face, splashing over and over
again until I was blinded. I couldn't see where they were coming
from anymore, and I couldn't see Stephanie - until I heard her
scream my name and break through the group of guys who had
surrounded and groped her.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie agreed Tuesday to have her comments published on
condition that her last name be withheld.
</P>
<P>
   We had been on the Fifth Avenue side of Central Park for most of
the afternoon, watching the Puerto Rican Day Parade. And aside from
the pushing and shoving among the massive crowd, we hadn't seen any
rowdiness.
</P>
<P>
   We moved into the park in the late afternoon to get away from
the parade spectators, and were making our way to the West Side,
running into acquaintances, and stopping to people-watch.
</P>
<P>
   Hormones were definitely running high in the park. ''Guys and
girls were flirting, but there wasn't anything disorderly going on
from what I saw,'' Stephanie recalled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   We meant to exit on Central Park West but got turned around and
ended up near Central Park South close to 6 p.m. There were a lot
of blocked-off walkways and police along Fifth Avenue, but when we
got near the south entrance, there were no officers in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of ironic this (the assaults) happened at the
entrance, a place you would think there would be more police,''
Stephanie said. ''It seemed police were mostly concerned people
would break through barricades and join in the parade.''
</P>
<P>
   As we neared the entrance, we heard shouting coming from a crowd
of guys.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw water going up in the air,'' Stephanie said. ''I was too
far away to assess what exactly was going on, but I didn't want to
walk through that area just because you never know what could
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a guy tapped her shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ''He told me, 'Don't go through there. Trust me, don't go
through there,''' Stephanie said.
</P>
<P>
   We aimed for the side wall of the park, me in front and
Stephanie behind, assuming the guys would be too busy bothering
some other women to notice us. We were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''Apparently, I caught somebody's attention because one guy
started pointing at me and yelling 'Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo,'''
Stephanie recalled, still shaken two days later.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before I knew it, I was surrounded by what seemed to be 20
guys, all pouring water on me, and I was trying to push through.
They were coming at me from all directions, and they were grabbing
my butt, groping my butt, and I was screaming and I was trying to
get through, trying to get away.''
</P>
<P>
   The guys had separated us, so I couldn't see Stephanie and she
couldn't see me. I was lucky; the guys around me didn't try to
touch me, and I was able to keep moving forward. The ones around
Stephanie had her trapped.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was scared. I felt like I had no control, everything
happened so fast but yet it felt like slow motion,'' she said. ''I
didn't know what would end up happening; that was the scariest part
of all.''
</P>
<P>
   She managed to push through and get to where I was. I was
stunned at her appearance - she was soaked. Her shorts, her tank
top, her hair, there wasn't a dry spot anywhere on her
six-foot-tall frame.
</P>
<P>
   We left the park then, heading back uptown on the train. It
wasn't until we got to the subway station at Columbus Circle that
we saw any police officers.
</P>
<P>
   On the train, we kept talking about what had just happened, how
it was the kind of situation that could easily lead to some woman
really getting hurt. Then, on the news that night, we heard that it
had.
</P>
<P>
   ''They could have pushed me to the ground like they did those
other girls,'' said Stephanie. ''Seeing the report on the news, I
just knew it was the same guys and I just feel fortunate that
nothing worse happened to me.''

<HEADLINE> Israelis, Palestinians Reopen Talks  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Faced with a self-imposed mid-September
deadline, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators resumed their
slow-moving talks Tuesday under U.S. auspices.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is an accord settling the future of Jerusalem and
determining the dimensions of a state the Palestinians are expected
to establish on Israeli-held land.
</P>
<P>
   The American hosts declined to say whether the first round of
talks in more than two weeks was productive, and Israeli and
Palestinian officials, at U.S. direction, declined to characterize
the discussions held at two American air force bases.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously there's not much time between now and September, and
I think as evidenced by the fact that the parties are here in the
Washington area discussing the issues, they take it very
seriously,'' the White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset, U.S. mediator Aaron D. Miller met separately with
each side. Then the Israelis and Palestinians met face-to-face,
without American participation. They also canceled a planned
three-way evening meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees, water problems and a promised Israeli pullback this
month on the West Bank also were on the agenda at Andrews Air Force
Base in suburban Maryland and at Bolling Air Force Base in
southeast Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was due to fly here on
Wednesday to meet with President Clinton Thursday at the White
House. He is expected to meet also with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Hasan Abdel Rahman, the PLO's representative in Washington, said
''we hope that this round of negotiations will lead to an agreement
on a framework'' for an overall settlement and that U.S. mediation
efforts will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   With the clock ticking down, and President Clinton eager for an
accord in the final months of his second term, American mediators
were due to take a more forceful role to try to reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   To this point, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have not even
begun official discussions of Jerusalem, part of which Arafat is
demanding as a capital, and have made little headway on other
thorny issues.
</P>
<P>
   The talks broke down two weeks ago amid violence on the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after talking to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in
Jerusalem and Arafat in the West Bank town of Ramallah, Albright
said they wanted the United States to ''call audibles'' -- a
reference to football quarterbacks calling plays at the line of
scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   But before flying Monday to Damascus and the funeral of Syrian
President Hafez Assad, whose own negotiations with Israel were
mired in disagreement, Albright said she did not expect a
breakthrough soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issues are difficult and complex and will take time to
resolve,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's message to the negotiators, Lockhart said Monday, was
that ''time is short. We're at a critical moment in this process,
and all the parties need to understand the importance of working
together to bridge these remaining differences, as difficult as
they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak is trying to prepare the Israeli people for more
concessions to Arafat. He has already offered suburbs of Jerusalem
and said he would carry out this month's promised pullback on the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Israeli and Palestinian leaders have accused the other
of foot-dragging.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is faced with severe political problems at home, with
opponents trying to force new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Albright have publicly expressed their support for
Palestinian ''aspirations,'' without specifying what they had in
mind or what they thought Israel should do in the Palestinians'
behalf.

<HEADLINE> New tests all negative for EEE, West Nile-like virus  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The first batch of mosquitoes tested this
season showed no trace of either the Eastern Equine or West
Nile-like strains of the encephalitis virus, state environmental
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As of June 13, 1,493 mosquitoes had been trapped and tested from
12 sites statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Mosquito traps placed by the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment
Station in 73 locations will be collected on a 10-day rotation.
Trapping began June 1 and will continue through early fall.
</P>
<P>
   As of June 9, 27 birds had also tested negative for the West
Nile-like strain of the virus, the state Department of
Environmental Protection said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, New York announced that two crows tested positive for
the West Nile-like strain of the virus. Another crow tested
positive for the virus in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The virus has not caused any human sickness in Connecticut, but
last year infected 72 people in New York, killing seven.
</P>
<P>
   The virus was found last season in two mosquitoes trapped on the
Greenwich/Stamford town line and in thousands of birds in New York,
New Jersey and Connecticut.

<HEADLINE> 3 Acquitted in Irish Gun Case  </HEADLINE>
By TERRY SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Three men were convicted Tuesday of
shipping weapons to Ireland, but acquitted of the most serious
charges against them.
</P>
<P>
   Conor Claxton, Martin Mullan and Anthony Smyth were acquitted on
charges of shipping weapons to terrorists and conspiracy to maim or
murder persons in a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
   If they had been convicted of the more serious charges, they
could have faced up to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict was read, Claxton turned to his family and
supporters in the courtroom, smiled and gave a thumbs-up. He then
hugged his attorney, Fred Haddad.
</P>
<P>
   Claxton, a 27-year-old Northern Ireland resident; Mullan, a
30-year-old Philadelphia handyman; and Smyth, a 43-year-old car
salesman in Weston, a Fort Lauderdale suburb, were arrested in
July. All three are all Roman Catholic natives of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   They were accused of buying guns and ammunition in Florida and
then mailing them to Ireland for the Irish Republican Army, which
has waged a long battle against the British government in Northern
Ireland. Police intercepted 23 packages containing 122 guns and
other weapons allegedly mailed by the group.
</P>
<P>
   Claxton, an admitted IRA member and the group's leader, was
convicted on 39 counts, including using a false passport to
facilitate terrorism, weapons smuggling and conspiracy. He faces a
maximum sentence of 275 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Smyth was convicted on 31 counts and faces a maximum penalty of
116 years; Mullan was convicted of 10 counts and faces a maximum 63
years.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Richard Scruggs said that he thinks the jurors may
have been influenced by recent developments in Northern Ireland,
where the IRA has agreed to put aside its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will never second-guess what a jury did,'' Scruggs said.
</P>
<P>
   During the monthlong trial, Claxton insisted that only he knew
about the gun smuggling and that he didn't know it was illegal. He
testified that militant Irish-Americans pushed him to buy weapons
because they feared Catholics -- few of whom are allowed to own guns
in Northern Ireland -- could be left at the mercy of the Protestant
paramilitary and police forces under the recent peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   The defense maintained that the purchases could be considered
self-defense given the years of bloodshed in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The defense also said that Mullan didn't know the packages he
mailed for Claxton during a family vacation contained weapons, and
that Smyth thought he was acting as a middleman for legitimate gun
deals.
</P>
<P>
   Smyth's fiancee, Siobhan Brown, was also arrested and pleaded
guilty to one of 33 counts against her. She awaits sentencing this
month.

years ago, he envisioned it as the first step in the transformation
of seedy Admiral Wilson Boulevard, which cuts through the city and
leads to Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's where we felt our mission was to begin,'' Treadwell
said outside his church Tuesday. ''Change the building, change the
reputation, change the look of the boulevard. Through our prayers,
through our presence. Starting with one hopeful sign in the middle
of the prostitution, the porn places.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the dilapidated strip clubs, motels and gas stations and
most of the billboards hawking nude dancers and X-rated movies are
gone.
</P>
<P>
   In their place will be a tree-lined park along the Cooper River
with picnic and play areas, a fishing platform, a bicycle path and
an exercise loop. The boulevard itself is being resurfaced and
landscaped.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman's goal was for the project, being done by
the state and the Delaware River Port Authority, to be finished by
the end of July, when the Republican National Convention begins
across the river in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The convention's opening ceremonies will be held on Camden's
riverfront, and delegate and corporate events will be held at the
Thomas Kean New Jersey State Aquarium and the Sony E-Center. Also,
many of the delegates will stay in southern New Jersey hotels.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't afford to pass up the chance to put New Jersey's best
foot forward,'' Whitman said in March 1999, when the project was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   Work is on schedule, Joe Diemer, spokesman for the port
authority, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The port authority has reached agreements with owners of nearly
40 of the 44 properties on the south side of the highway, where the
park will be located. Many of those buildings have been demolished
and work on the road should be finished by the end of June. Sod or
grass seed will soon be put down where the buildings once stood.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd like to have a good deal of that south side green within
the next several weeks,'' Diemer said, adding that the whole park
will be finished by next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Work on the north side of the road, is ''slower and not as
exciting, but integral to the project,'' Diemer said. The state and
port authority are developing a plan to create a business zone
there, possibly including an industrial park and new homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The north side has real significant economic potential on the
highway leading right into Philadelphia,'' Diemer said.
</P>
<P>
   Agreements still need to be reached with several south side
property owners on prices to be paid for their properties, Diemer
said, but no one has made any legal challenges to the process.
</P>
<P>
   The port authority and Gatekeepers Fellowship Church reached an
agreement Monday for the port authority to take title to the church
and demolish it. Treadwell and his 200 members will move across the
highway to a former car dealership.
</P>
<P>
   No one is happier about that than Treadwell.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't look at it like we've lost,'' he said. ''We look at
it like we've really gained. We wanted to change the reputation of
the city and the boulevard. When people came by here they used to
see pornography, prostitution and addiction. Now, they'll be able
to say, 'Wow. It's changing around here.'''
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe it would be very, very hard for prostitution and
drug traffic to continue here because the climate has changed,'' he
said. ''I believe this beautification has raised the attitude of
this city, also raised the hope.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Rises 58; Nasdaq Up 83  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose Tuesday as investors seized on the
latest retail sales report as evidence that the economy is slowing
just enough to persuade the Federal Reserve to leave interest rates
unchanged at its next meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Investors' optimism over the state of the economy helped the
market break out of a slump that started after Wall Street
investment firm Sanford Bernstein cut its rating and earnings
estimates for Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 57.63 to close at
10,621.84. The blue-chip index recovered from an early loss of more
than 70 points, and without Hewlett-Packard's steep loss would have
closed at least 35 points higher.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also rose. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 23.44 at 1,469.44, and the Nasdaq composite index was
up 83.15 at 3,851.06.
</P>
<P>
   In a session that saw the market struggle to find direction,
stocks rose after Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan applauded the use of
technology to enhance the productivity of American workers.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks before the New York Association for Business
Economics, Greenspan said much of the improvement in productivity
was due to basic changes in the economy, rather than temporary
factors that could disappear.
</P>
<P>
   While Greenspan did not discuss interest rates, many investors
took his comments as a sign that the Fed is growing more
comfortable with the pace of the economy's growth.
</P>
<P>
   The latest sign that the economy is returning to a more
sustainable pace came from the Commerce Department, which said
retail sales fell for the second month in a row in May, the latest
sign that six interest rate increases by the Fed are successfully
slowing consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, revised figures showed that retail sales fell 0.6
percent in April, much weaker than the government estimated one
month ago. The combination of two weaker than expected months at
the nation's stores allowed investors to hope that the Fed might
hold rates steady at its next meeting on June 28.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the Fed is finished for the year,'' said Don Selkin,
chief investment strategist at Joseph Gunnar in New York. Selkin
pointed out that May economic figures don't reflect the Fed's last
rate increase, a half-percentage point boost on May 16 that drove
rates to the highest level since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will see more evidence of a slowdown, and with that
evidence in hand, the Fed really won't be able to justify raising
rates any higher,'' Selkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts said investors are also concerned that the
hoped-for slowdown, which the Fed hopes will prevent inflation from
rearing up, will eventually hurt corporate earnings. On Tuesday,
investors embraced so-called defensive stocks -- those whose profits
aren't significantly affected by fluctuations in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Merck rose $3.50 to $73.438 and Warner Lambert rose $2.813 to
$125.875.
</P>
<P>
   Also, financial stocks rose on the hope that rates will soon
stabilize. Banks and brokerages are especially vulnerable to
interest rate fluctuations. Lehman Brothers rose $1.438 to $86.625
and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter rose $2.563 to $83.375.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard fell $7 to $119, pulling the Dow lower. Sanford
Bernstein lowered its rating on Hewlett-Packard to a ''market
perform'' from ''market outperform'' and reduced earnings
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The market's harsh punishment of Hewlett-Packard indicated that
investors remain nervous about corporate profits, which are
generally threatened by rising interest rates, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any kind of bad news you see out there will be taken very
badly by the equity markets,'' said Gary Dugan, head of global
equity at J.P. Morgan Investment Management. ''The pressures are
quite enormous on the corporate sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 910.81 million
shares, compared with 751.95 million at the same time Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.24 to 513.75.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.4 percent.
Germany's DAX index rose 0.5 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 gained
0.3 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 0.3 percent lower.

<HEADLINE> Cop admits lying to Louima investigators  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A police officer on trial in Brooklyn federal
court admitted Tuesday he lied to protect himself and other
officers instead of helping authorities catch the patrolmen who
tortured Abner Louima in a precinct bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''You lied because you didn't want to give information that
would get another cop in trouble ... because you didn't want to end
up a witness in the Louima case, right?'' prosecutor Alan Vinegrad
asked defendant Francisco Rosario on cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes,'' the officer replied.
</P>
<P>
   Rosario, 35, took the stand in his own defense against charges
he misled investigators by not telling them he saw Officer Justin
Volpe throw a battered, half-naked Louima into a holding cell
following the infamous 1997 attack in Brooklyn's 70th Precinct. The
defendant was booking his own prisoner at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe pleaded guilty to sodomizing the handcuffed prisoner with
a broken broomstick in a fit of rage. Another officer, Charles
Schwarz, was convicted at an earlier trial of holding down Louima
during the assault.
</P>
<P>
   Rosario faces charges that he and his partner conspired to make
false statements - part of what prosecutors say was a ''blue wall
of silence'' surrounding the case. If convicted, he faces up to
five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant told the jury Tuesday that a union delegate with
the powerful Patrolmen's Benevolent Association pressured him to
keep quiet when investigators began questioning potential police
witnesses. Asked about the testimony, PBA spokesman Joseph Mancini
refused comment.
</P>
<P>
   Rosario testified that his supervisor, Sgt. James Yee, told him,
''Keep me out of this'' - a claim Yee denies. He also said he was
motivated by fear.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt like my world was tumbling,'' he said. ''I was
afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense has argued Rosario's decision to first tell FBI
agents he was not inside the holding cell area was a mistake, not a
federal offense. He testified that he tried to set the record
straight in a follow-up interview, admitting he had seen an officer
toss Louima into a cell, then curse at the Haitian immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought once I came clean, that I would be OK,'' Rosario
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rosario said the officer wasn't Volpe, which prosecutors
allege was another lie.
</P>
<P>
   On cross-examination, Vinegrad sought to portray Rosario as a
corrupt cop who put his own interests ahead of the helpless victim
of a vicious assault.
</P>
<P>
   ''You just thought about yourself, right?'' Vinegrad asked in
one exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You didn't give a thought to Mr. Louima?''
</P>
<P>
   ''At that point, yes.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Votes: Control Pesticide Use  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate voted 84-14 on Tuesday to restrict
the Pentagon's use of powerful pesticides on installations where
there are children as the chamber moved toward approval of a $287.4
billion Defense Department spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment's author, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said
current rules on permissible levels of toxins ''were set to protect
essentially 155-pound men.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents suggested the measure would single out military bases
for more stringent requirements than are in place at other federal
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said that the measure would put into law what is already
general Pentagon policy -- and that she was trying to impose the
same restrictions throughout the government but that ''so far we
have not had much luck moving that larger package.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure would ban in areas where there may be children like
schools and playgrounds certain pesticides that contain
cancer-containing agents and nerve toxins.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pound for pound of body weight, children eat more food, drink
more water and breath more air than adults -- so they are
vulnerable,'' Boxer said.
</P>
<P>
   Before a final vote on the measure, the Senate was also to vote
on an amendment by Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., that would
transfer $1 billion from the defense budget to education. It was
not expected to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also accepted, by voice vote, a Boxer amendment to
safeguard the privacy of military medical records.
</P>
<P>
   Ruled out of order -- because it did not involve defense spending
directly -- was an amendment by Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., that would
ease rules governing high-speed computer exports.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill is a $3 billion increase over the Clinton
administration request, although about $1 billion less than the
version passed last week by the House.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on a related issue, Rep. Sonny Callahan, D-Ala.,
chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on foreign
operations, suggested he may seek to withhold aid to Israel -- or at
least delay it -- to protest Israel's decision to sell advance radar
to China.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Monday urged Congress
against any such linkage.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is building a plane for China and equipping it with the
U.S.-developed PHALCON airborne early warning radar system at a
cost of $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan has suggested that $2.8 billion in aid to Israel be cut
by that $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   However, on Tuesday he said that he would propose instead to
hold up the early disbursement of Israel's aid money -- Israel
traditionally gets the money up front, in the first two weeks of
each new fiscal year -- for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   He said that would ''give the administration time to negotiate
what we hope will be an acceptable result.''
</P>
<P>
   But, if no such agreement was reached by time a final version of
the foreign aid bill is hammered out by a House-Senate conference
committee this summer, ''the hammer is still there and could
fall,'' Callahan said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He gave the administration a possible way out, saying that if
Secretary of Defense William Cohen ''wants to issue a statement
saying it's not a threat to our national security, then the issue
is over with.''
</P>
<P>
   The new fiscal year begins Oct. 1.

<HEADLINE> Whitman presses for tougher criminal penalties on teen 'rave' drug  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman called Tuesday for
quick steps to ratchet up the criminal penalties for possession or
sale of the illegal drug Ecstasy, which officials claim has grown
alarmingly in popularity among teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said the psychedelic drug has hidden dangers, with
recent studies linking frequent use to brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''The promise of a quick thrill is not worth a lifetime of
suffering and impairment,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials claimed the drug is known to cause
severe and sudden illness, including artificially high temperatures
that can cause death.
</P>
<P>
   The law Whitman proposed would put Ecstasy offenses on the same
footing as heroin and cocaine, with those caught in possession of
five ounces or more - the equivalent of about 500 pills or doses -
facing a prison term of up to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy is the most common of the street nicknames for the
man-made compound 3-4 methylene-dioxy-methamphetamine, or MDMA.
Other compounds found to be dangerous have sometimes been sold
under the same name, and other nicknames include ''X,'' ''XTC,''
and ''Adam.''
</P>
<P>
   Current law classifies any possession of Ecstasy as a
third-degree drug offense in which convicts face five years in
prison, a sentence that is rarely meted out for first-time
offenders. The current law sets no variety in penalties according
to volume of the drug seized, so offenders caught with 10 pills or
10,000 pills face the same charge.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said she wants the tougher law in place before the
Legislature takes its summer break in two weeks and believes she
can get it since there has been little resistance to date among
lawmakers eager to toughen drug laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is sufficient to say that the impact of Ecstasy is huge,
but this is a drug that is just starting to come on the market,
starting to grow, so I believe it is an opportunity that we have
now, a window of opportunity, to start to get control of this,''
the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean County Prosecutor E. David Millard said the use of Ecstasy
had a profound influence last summer in areas of the New Jersey
shore popular with teens, including alcohol-free dance clubs that
cater to the under-21 set.
</P>
<P>
   ''Use was substantial, and in many instances the entire club
scene was changing and evolving, in effect being built around the
use of Ecstasy,'' Millard said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General Paul Zoubek said local police have
reported that some club owners appear to be tolerating or catering
to Ecstasy crowds by stocking huge supplies of bottled water, since
the drug creates dehydration and sometimes a fever. He said Ecstasy
users can also be detected by their fondness for infant pacifiers
and oversized lollipops since the drug often prompts users to grind
their teeth.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed law would maintain the third-degree offense only
for those caught with less than half an ounce, and those caught
with between half an ounce and five ounces would face a
second-degree offense punishable by 10 years in prison. There are
generally 100 pills or doses per ounce, Zoubek said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also provide for warnings to parents and
teen-agers through the state Health and Education departments about
the risks of Ecstasy. The warning will include letters home and
posters for schools and health facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Morris County Prosecutor John Dangler, president of the state's
prosecutors association, said all counties have been reporting
increases in the drug, especially among teens at liquor-free clubs
and the spontaneous concerts or music festivals known as ''raves.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 people, many of them teen-agers, were hospitalized
two weeks ago for drug abuse after an all-night rave at the South
Jersey Expo Center in Pennsauken. Police said Ecstasy was among the
drugs detected and two arrests were made for possession of the
drug.
</P>
<P>
   Dangler said an outdoor rave concert in Morris County last year
drew thousands of teens from several states, and that 12 were
hospitalized in critical condition after using Ecstasy or similar
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   And Terrence Farley, first assistant prosecutor of Ocean County,
said a 17-year-old girl died last summer after tripping on Ecstasy
for several days. Farley said the girl was injured after falling
from a moving car and died of brain damage from an exceedingly high
temperature.

<HEADLINE> 10 women come forward; questions surround police handling  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Two days after a roving mob terrorized at least
10 women - including four tourists - in Central Park, questions
arose Tuesday about how authorities handled the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Two victims said police were slow to respond to their cries.
Ironically, more than 900 officers were assigned to patrol the park
that day because of a parade on adjacent Fifth Avenue. On a normal
Sunday, 36 officers patrol the 840-acre park.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard
Safir brushed off the incidents as ''isolated.'' On Tuesday, their
tone softened.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very concerned about the women who got assaulted, maybe
more than you, because I feel responsible,'' Giuliani told
reporters. ''We regret very much that this has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes some sick, crazy criminal or drunk kids do sick
things,'' said Giuliani. He added that the ''sick and shocking and
horrible'' incidents will be investigated ''with tremendous
enthusiasm and enormous force.''
</P>
<P>
   The incidents involved men spraying water on women, tearing at
their clothes, groping them and, in some cases, robbing them.
Although perhaps as many as 20 to 40 men took part, only two were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   At their bail hearing Tuesday, prosecutors related the ordeal of
an 18-year-old British tourist. She and her friends were surrounded
and soaked with water; men tore at her shirt and ripped off her
shorts; hands violated her private areas. Then the men were gone,
fleeing into crowds of people in the park seeking relief from the
90-degree weather.
</P>
<P>
   The woman quickly found two cops who helped her search for her
attackers. Minutes later, two men were arrested: the wrong men,
defense lawyers claim.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt that they were under a lot of pressure to arrest
somebody,'' said David Kapner, attorney for David Rowe, 24, of
Hempstead, on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting incidents and murders are is on the rise in the city, a
contrast to dramatic declines in the 1990s. Relatively little crime
has occurred this year in Central Park, but that was no comfort for
victims of Sunday's rampage.
</P>
<P>
   Peyton Bryant, 29, a kickboxing teacher in Manhattan, was
in-line skating near Central Park South and Sixth Avenue when the
group of men set upon her, trying to pull down her pants. Bryant
struggled and the men ran off.
</P>
<P>
   ''I skated over to an officer and told him I was attacked and
that the crowd was out of control,'' Bryant said. ''I told him I
was assaulted, but he acted like it was nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant approached two other officers who told her to file a
report at the Midtown North Precinct. She did, but no one offered
to help her look for her attackers, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman, the mother of one of two Long Island teen-agers
attacked, said police also ignored her daughter's cries. They only
pointed to an ambulance parked nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Police are conducting an internal investigation into the
complaints, and Giuliani said if the allegations are true, the
officers will be ''severely disciplined.'' The mayor offered a
$10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction
of any of the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   All the attacks occurred during a short span of time, around 6
p.m. and in the southern portion of the park, near the zoo and the
Plaza Hotel. Among the victims were a French couple on their
honeymoon, the three British tourists, and an Associated Press
reporter and her friend.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said police officers were not nearby when the specific
incidents occurred.
</P>
<P>
   While some victims criticized the police, the French couple
praised them, the husband told the AP in a telephone interview
Tuesday. After the attack, the couple ran to an officer, who put
them in his car. The couple was surrounded by about 100 people - 10
to 20 attacked them, the husband said. Some of the crowd ran after
them, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ''He took us in his car to protect us from the crowd,'' said the
man, who did not want his name or his wife's to be used. The
officer radioed for help, and within minutes, the husband said
between 50 to 60 cops on scooters and cars arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The officers asked if the couple could identify their attackers,
but the husband said ''We weren't ready to do that at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   The husband added that when the group first surrounded him and
his wife, he thought it was a joke. He also said there were several
people snapping pictures and videotaping them.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, police were working with several television stations
to obtain amateur videotape of the attacks that was aired during
Monday and Tuesday newscasts. Police hope to identify some of the
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Ludwig, attorney for defendant Tremayne Bain, 23, of
Brooklyn, said the group his client and Rowe were with have given a
videotape to police that shows the defendants were not involved in
the attacks. Police did not immediately comment on Ludwig's
assertions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tape corroborates the fact that they were about 150 yards
away when the attack (on the British tourists) took place,'' Ludwig
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rowe, and Bain were charged with second-degree aggravated sexual
abuse, first-degree sexual abuse and second-degree robbery. Bail
was set at $10,000 for each, and both were still in jail Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man said anything during the brief hearing, and they did
not enter pleas. They are due back in court Friday. Rowe and Bain,
who are friends, had come into Manhattan to watch the Puerto Rican
Day parade, Kapner added.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the attacks, Central Park was crowded as usual on Monday
and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Central Park is my oasis away from the big city,'' said Claire
Duane, 34, of Manhattan. ''We can't let thugs like this take away
our refuge, our sense of well-being.''

<HEADLINE> Colombian Leader Meets Cuban Exile  </HEADLINE>
By VIVIAN SEQUERA
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Colombian rebel leader Raul Reyes met here Tuesday
with a Colombian exile who's playing a key role in peace talks
aimed at ending their nation's long-running insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's to talk -- talk about how to advance the peace,'' Reyes
told The Associated Press at a hotel in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes, a leader of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia,
declined to comment further on his visit or say whether he would
meet with President Fidel Castro. The Cuban government is not
expected to be a party to talks, but Castro has said he favors a
negotiated peace in Colombia's 36-year war.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes met with Alvaro Leyva Duran, a former Colombian minister
of energy and mines, lives in Costa Rica, where he was granted
political asylum in 1998. At the time he was under investigation in
his homeland for allegedly receiving money from the Cali drug
cartel.
</P>
<P>
   Leyva Duran was formally charged in absentia last year, but many
in Colombia consider the criminal charges a political vendetta by
former President Ernesto Samper.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes traveled last week to Alcala de Henares, Spain, where he
and Fabio Valencia, a government delegate at the peace talks,
attended a forum on the Colombian peace process. At the forum, the
Colombians said they hoped to reach a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   During a meeting in Madrid beforehand, Reyes and Valencia talked
with Antonio Garcia, military chief of the National Liberation
Army, or ELN, Colombia's other major guerrilla group. It was the
first time since failed 1992 peace talks that Colombia's two most
important rebel groups had met with a government negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   The FARC, which has about 15,000 fighters, is the larger of the
two main guerrilla groups. At least 30,000 people have died in the
civil war.

<HEADLINE> Pirro's defense rests without calling witnesses  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - The defense suddenly rested Tuesday
without calling any witnesses in the criminal tax evasion case
against millionaire lobbyist Albert Pirro, husband of Westchester
County's celebrity district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Al Pirro does not wish to call any witnesses, alive or
dead,'' said defense attorney Gustave Newman.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, at the start of the court session, obviously
surprised the jurors, who immediately started buzzing among
themselves as federal Judge Barrington Parker spoke to the lawyers
privately. At least one of the expected defense witnesses was in
court, ready to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Pirro had pledged that the trial would address what he claimed
was the political motive behind his prosecution - holding back his
wife's career. But there was no mention of that at trial.
</P>
<P>
   Pirro and his accountant brother Anthony - whose defense also
rested - are accused of conspiring to hide more than $1 million of
Albert's income as business writeoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The jury had heard four weeks of testimony from prosecution
witnesses who collectively offered a detailed look at Pirro's
lavish lifestyle, much of which was written off as tax deductions
for his many companies. Such luxuries as a $123,000 Ferrari, a
$13,000 rug and home security gates that cost $45,000 were personal
items, bought by Pirro's businesses, that should have been treated
as income, the prosecution said.
</P>
<P>
   An Internal Revenue Service agent who testified for five days
said Pirro underpaid taxes by $412,518.
</P>
<P>
   The defense acknowledged that Pirro's tax returns were flawed
but insisted that there was no criminal intent, that Pirro left
such matters to his bookkeepers, and that 95 percent of all the
companies' deductions were legitimate. On Monday, in arguing for
dismissal of the charges, defense lawyer Robert Giuffra said the
prosecution found ''no effort to cover anything up.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors Cathy Seibel and Elliott Jacobson, who rested their
case Monday, would not comment on the defense strategy, nor would
Marvin Smilon, spokesman for U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White.
</P>
<P>
   Pirro said only, ''I feel great'' outside court. His lawyers
refused to say why they didn't call witnesses, though typically it
reflects confidence that the prosecution did not meet the burden of
proof.
</P>
<P>
   The defense said later, at a conference with the judge about how
to instruct the jury, that one witness they wanted to call -
Pirro's office manager, Marie Tedeschi - had refused, invoking her
right not to testify against herself. Defense lawyer Annemarie
Hassett said the prosecution had rendered Tedeschi ''unavailable''
by refusing to grant her immunity after telling her she might be
prosecuted. The judge said that was not improper.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, who attended much of the trial
and was mentioned in court every day, said, ''It's clear there was
no need'' to present witnesses on her husband's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ''I agree with the defense decision,'' she said. ''I understand
it and I think the jury will as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge scheduled closing arguments for Wednesday and Thursday
and said jury deliberations would begin Monday.

<HEADLINE> Divers, dogs search unsuccessfully for boat crash victims  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   OCEAN CITY, N.J. (AP) - Divers and cadaver-sniffing dogs
searched unsuccessfully again Tuesday for two people missing and
presumed dead in a boating accident that killed two others.
</P>
<P>
   While the grieving mother of Jean Greenwood, 30, of Sewell,
watched from shore, four State Police boats dragged the bottom of
Peck's Bay for more than six hours, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like a needle in a haystack out there,'' said Sgt. Steve
Cozzi, head of the underwater recovery unit.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwood and James G. Fisler, 25, of Sewell, were among four
occupants of a 26-food speedboat that was broadsided by a cabin
cruiser about 7 p.m. Sunday. They were knocked overboard and
haven't been seen since.
</P>
<P>
   Two other men in the boat, including driver Dominic Laspata, 26,
of Westville, were killed. State Police confirmed Tuesday that
Greenwood was aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The nine people aboard the 30-foot cabin cruiser, here to attend
a North Penn High School graduation party at the home of a
classmate, escaped serious injury, including driver John Lego, 52,
of Lansdale, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   James Swiggard, 18, of Norristown, Pa., who was listed in
serious condition Monday at Atlantic City Medical Center, was
transferred to another hospital Tuesday. No further information was
available; the family asked that no information be released,
Atlantic City Medical Center spokeswoman Debbie Wrigley said.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, authorities and family members alike had given up
hope that either of the missing people would be found alive.
</P>
<P>
   State Police divers, assisted by Palisades Search &AMP; Rescue Dog
Association dogs, searched an area 300 yards wide by a half-mile
long, dragging the bay bottom with hooks.
</P>
<P>
   A State Police helicopter hovered about 100 feet above them for
part of the afternoon, with troopers looking down at the shallow
water shoals surrounding salt marsh flats in search of bodies.
</P>
<P>
   They were hampered by high wind, choppy water and the fact that
the exact point where the collision occurred was unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ''The point of impact is easy to determine in a road accident,
because you have skid marks,'' said Cozzi. ''I don't have a point
of impact here. If I had one, we'd be better off.''
</P>
<P>
   The water in the search area ranges from three to 15 feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   The southbound cabin cruiser and the northbound speedboat, which
were traveling in an area outside a ''no wake'' zone with no speed
limit, both turned east just before the collision.
</P>
<P>
   The cabin cruiser plowed into the left side of the speedboat,
sending all nine occupants of the cruiser flying into the water.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had no clue what was going on,'' said Kenneth Myers Jr., 18,
of Lansdale, one of the survivors. ''I thought someone had pushed
me off the boat to be funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers landed in the water next to one of the dead men.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a bunch of debris all over the place. I found a body
and brought it on to the other boat. He had lacerations across the
face. His face was not recognizable at all,'' Myers said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Myers, who suffered an elbow injury, a groin injury and a blow
to the head, was treated and released from a hospital Sunday. On
Tuesday, he was to get a complete mental and physical evaluation,
his mother said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's all right, not great,'' said Kathy Myers, 50. ''He keeps
talking about how the guy looked.''
</P>
<P>
   Cody, a cadaver-sniffing border collie who wore an orange life
jacket, responded to scents in five different locations Tuesday but
each time, divers found no body, Cozzi said.
</P>
<P>
   The divers and dogs quit about 4 p.m. Tuesday but State Police
skiffs were to continue searching the water's surface through the
night. The full-scale search will resume Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwood's mother, Ruth Greenwood, sat on the back bumper of a
State Police truck with four unidentified friends as the search
continued Tuesday, occasionally embracing them.
</P>
<P>
   When one of the State Police boats came in, the five rushed to
the dock to ask Trooper David Burns for a progress report.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Fisler's former wrestling coach at Gloucester County
College, Chuck Williamson, stood with his wife, peering through
binoculars at the recovery operation about 300 yards from shore.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson, 58, of Woodbury, called him ''a good kid.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He wasn't an all-American and he wasn't the best on the team,
but whenever we needed him, he was there. This is heartbreaking,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Glassboro Police Department, where Fisler worked as a
part-time police officer, the mood was somber.
</P>
<P>
   ''You always pray that he still might be safe somewhere, but
that certainly does not seem too promising right now,'' said Police
Chief Patricia Kunchynski.

<HEADLINE> Lubavitch Group Names New Rabbi  </HEADLINE>
By ANNA DOLGOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- A Jewish group on Tuesday proclaimed its spiritual
leader to be the new chief rabbi of Russia, but the man who has
held the post claimed the move was part of a Kremlin plot to use
religious organizations in a political power-struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Both Adolf Shayevich, Russia's chief rabbi since the early
1980s, and Berl Lazar, named chief rabbi by the Federation of
Jewish Communities on Tuesday, called the other an impostor.
</P>
<P>
   Shayevich represents mainstream Orthodox Jews in Russia, while
Lazar heads the ultra-Orthodox Chabad Lubavitch movement. Most of
the estimated half million Jews in Russia are nonobservant, but the
rival religious groups are vying for funding and influence.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Chlenov, president of Jewish umbrella group Vaad, said
the Federation, which only represents Lubavitch Jews, ''has taken
too much upon itself'' by deciding to choose Russia's chief rabbi.
The group supporting Shayevich is the Congress of Jewish Religious
Communities and Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any person can gather a group of his supporters and proclaim
himself whatever he wants, but he shouldn't forget that he has been
elected as chief of those supporters he gathered,'' Chlenov said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazar and Federation spokesman Borukh Gorin conceded that
Tuesday's congress was largely made up of the Chabad Lubavitch
movement. But Federation leaders insisted they initially had no
plans to replace Shayevich, and the question was raised by ordinary
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ''This question came up by itself,'' Federation president
Mikhail Gluz told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Shayevich insisted the attempt to replace him went beyond
religious rivalry and was spinning from intrigue-filled corridors
of the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   ''Based on my recent conversations with Chabad Lubavitch
representatives, I am beginning to think that ... very influential
people are behind this, people who are trying to pull the Jewish
community into their political squabbles,'' Shayevich said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested the move to replace him was part of a government
attempt to get at tycoon Vladimir Gusinsky, a powerful critic of
the Kremlin who heads the Russian Jewish Congress -- the secular
partner of Shayevich's religious group.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the Federation proclaimed Lazar to be the new chief
rabbi, news broke that Gusinsky was arrested on charges of stealing
state property.
</P>
<P>
   He was being held in a Moscow jail, the Interfax news agency
quoted his lawyer Pavel Astakhov as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky's holding company Media-Most was raided by government
tax police last month. He called the raid an attempt to threaten
his various media holdings, which have been critical of President
Vladimir Putin.

<HEADLINE> Justice Dept Supports Texas SBC Bid  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department lent its support
Tuesday to a bid by SBC Communications to offer long-distance
telephone service to its local customers in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Reversing itself, the department recommended that the Federal
Communications Commission permit SBC to enter the long-distance
market within its region. The commission, which must take into
account the Justice Department's evaluation, has until July 3 to
render a decision.
</P>
<P>
   If SBC gains approval to offer long-distance service, it would
mark only the second time that a local Bell company has met the
standards set forth by a 1996 telecommunications law. This
checklist requires that a Bell company must show in detail that it
has opened its local monopoly to give rivals a chance to compete,
before being allowed to offer long-distance service in those
markets. So far, Bell Atlantic has been the only company to meet
the test, in New York.
</P>
<P>
   SBC filed its initial application to offer long-distance service
in Texas at the beginning of this year. The bid received harsh
reviews from the Justice Department, which said the company had not
done enough to give competing companies access to its network, as
required by law, and recommended that the FCC deny the petition.
</P>
<P>
   The company ultimately requested a new review to bolster its
application with more information.
</P>
<P>
   This time the Justice Department said the company had provided
data indicating significant improvement on a number of matters.
Those include SBC's handling of requests from rival businesses
seeking to lease lines so they could offer high-speed Internet
service and its processing of orders to switch local phone
customers to competing providers.
</P>
<P>
   The department added, however, that ''additional performance
measures and ongoing refinement of performance measurement
processes are likely to be needed as new services and technologies
are implemented.''
</P>
<P>
   The FCC also must determine whether the new data accurately
reflect SBC's performance, the department said in its filing.
</P>
<P>
   It said the commission also should ensure ''that adequate
mechanisms exist to resolve emerging issues that will affect
competition.'' Those include a complaint by rival companies that
SBC is not allowing them to share certain lines to deliver
high-speed Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   The department noted that those issues already are before the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's support will join two endorsements from
the Texas Public Utility Commission, which the FCC also must
consider.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll give the DOJ's recommendation careful consideration
along with that of the state of Texas and our own public record,''
said an FCC spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   SBC welcomed the recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   The department's ''filing represents an impartial and objective
determination that the local market in Texas is irreversibly open
and that robust competition exists in that market,'' said Priscilla
Hill-Ardoin, senior vice president for Federal Regulatory Affairs
for SBC Communications.
</P>
<P>
   She said this marked the first time the department has given its
full support to an application by a Bell company seeking to offer
local customers long-distance service. Bell Atlantic did not
receive a full-force endorsement for New York service from the
Justice Department, but the FCC ultimately gave its approval in
late December.

<HEADLINE> Tuckahoe policeman admits sex with boy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - A policeman who had been considered a
community asset admitted in court Tuesday that he engaged in sex
with a 16-year-old boy in the back seat of his car.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for his guilty plea to third-degree sodomy, former
Tuckahoe police Officer Stanley Moore will get a sentence without
jail time. Prosecutors said they agreed to the deal only because
the stress of the case was threatening the victim's life.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Jeanine Pirro said the boy had attempted
suicide several times and doctors felt ''the very pendency of this
case has posed a life-threatening stress level to the victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore, 47, was a 16-year veteran of the Tuckahoe force and was
active in various civic endeavors. He had ''a reputation for being
a good cop, a good detective,'' Pirro said.
</P>
<P>
   But on March 12, he was arrested when a Westchester County
police officer on routine patrol saw him naked with the boy in the
car, parked at a county maintenance lot.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's sentence will include five years probation and
registration as a sex offender, Pirro said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuckahoe police Chief Gerard Mignone said Moore, who had been
suspended after his arrest, resigned Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was afforded his due process, which concludes one chapter
in his life and continues on to what lies ahead,'' the chief said.

<HEADLINE> Lazio: I'll need $15 million or more for Senate race  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Rep. Rick Lazio says he will need ''a ton of
dough'' - at least $15 million - to run his Senate campaign against
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing Tuesday on Don Imus' nationally syndicated morning
talk show, the little-known congressman from Long Island said,
''We're going to need a lot of money. ... It's a ton of dough.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton visited a hospital in suburban Westchester
County where she continued to attack the Republican as someone hard
to pin down on issues. She cited his support Monday for hate crimes
legislation approved last week by the GOP-led state Senate. Gay
rights groups in the past have been highly critical of Lazio for
not being supportive of such legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're going to have a great time trying to figure out where
he stands on issues,'' the first lady said.
</P>
<P>
   On the Imus show, Lazio said, ''We're going to need $15 million
or more'' for the race against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Through March 31, Clinton had raised more than $12 million for
the Senate race while her Republican opponent at the time, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, had collected more than $19 million. On May 19,
the New York City mayor withdrew from the race to deal with his
prostate cancer and Lazio announced his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   When Lazio suspended his Senate campaign plans last year at Gov.
George Pataki's request to allow Giuliani a clear run at Clinton,
the congressman had about $3.5 million in his campaign bank
account.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the first lady have said they plan to raise $25 million
for the race.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said his fund raising was going well, although the only
detail he provided was that his Internet campaign site had
generated about $300,000 in contributions since he entered the
Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   There was no response from the Lazio campaign Tuesday about how
much money in all the candidate has raised since Giuliani's May 19
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's comments came as a fourth statewide poll since Lazio got
into the race showed the Senate race to be a close one. The New
York Times/CBS News poll had Clinton favored by 44 percent of
voters to 39 percent for Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll of 1,187 likely voters was conducted June
4-10 and has a margin of error of plus of minus 3 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   The three polls out earlier either showed the race very close or
a statistical dead heat.

<HEADLINE> Post-conviction DNA testing bill unveiled by Hatch  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - New York Attorney General Elliot Spitzer urged
the Senate Judiciary Committee to adopt a national standard to
provide those already convicted of crimes with access to DNA
testing that could establish their innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Such a standard is already in place in New York and has not been
as costly or burdensome as critics had predicted, Spitzer said at a
Capitol Hill hearing Tuesday. He said DNA evidence has led to at
least seven exonerations in New York, which is one of only a few
states that has such a post-conviction standard in place.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our experience demonstrates that post-conviction DNA testing
can bolster the integrity of our judicial system without unduly
burdening our criminal justice system,'' Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, Sen. Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, unveiled a more restrictive bill than New York's.
Another bipartisan bill being pushed by Sens. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,
and Gordon Smith, R-Ore., is broader. It includes federal
competency requirements for defense lawyers in capital cases.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, where more executions take place then any other state,
the lack of quality defense counsel in capital cases has become a
''crisis,'' according to former Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Judge Charles Baird.
</P>
<P>
   ''And I can guarantee you that the state of Texas is not going
to address that,'' said Baird, who is a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's bill gives momentum to post-conviction genetic testing
as debate rages over capital punishment. Several men were released
from death row in Illinois in recent months, some because DNA
evidence cleared them. That prompted Illinois Gov. George Ryan to
place a temporary moratorium on executions there.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Barry Scheck, founder of the New York
City-based Innocence Project, and former death row inmate Dennis
Fritz, of Kansas City, Mo., were among those on Capitol Hill
testifying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is an urgent need for national legislation to assist a
narrow but important group of people: those who are sentenced to
decades in prison, or sit on death row, but could show through
post-conviction testing that they were wrongly imprisoned or
sentenced,'' Scheck said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Tuesday's hearing focused on what the threshold should
be for DNA testing post-conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy's bill would provide for DNA testing in cases where the
evidence is relevant to the defendant's claim that he or she is
wrongfully convicted or sentenced.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's bill is more narrow. It allows for DNA testing only if
the perpetrator's identity was an issue at the trial and if the
results could establish the defendant's innocence.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, a request for DNA testing is only granted if there
is a reasonable probability that if the results were admitted at
trial the verdict wold have been more favorable to the defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Also at the hearing, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said he was
introducing a bill to eliminate the backlog of DNA kits that have
yet to be tested. Schumer would spend $100 million over four years
to test the backlog of 180,000 DNA kits. In New York, there is a
backlog of 15,000 rape kits sitting in a refrigerated warehouse
waiting to be testing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Similar bills are pending in the House sponsored by New York
Reps. Benjamin Gilman, a Republican, and Anthony Weiner, a
Democrat.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Party Revives Old Tactics  </HEADLINE>
By MARK STEVENSON
The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- As a tight presidential election draws near,
activist groups charge that the government is falling back on old
practices -- using patronage and pressure on public employees to get
out the vote for the party that has run Mexico for 71 years.
</P>
<P>
   The government denies such claims. After repeated electoral
reforms, officials pledge the July 2 vote will be clean, with no
ballot-stuffing or stealing and an independent agency to do the
counting.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, several observer groups presented what they said
was evidence that the ruling party has dusted off some of its old
techniques of staying in power.
</P>
<P>
   Impoverished families in several parts of the country have been
told their children's $40-per-month government scholarships will
stop unless they sign a list promising to vote for ruling-party
candidates, one observer group said.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of such lists -- emblazoned with the emblem of
ruling-party presidential candidate Francisco Labastida and bearing
the addresses and voter I.D. numbers of potential voters -- were
among the documents made public Tuesday by Alianza Civica, a
nonpartisan group that campaigns for fair elections.
</P>
<P>
   In two states, opposition parties say, they have found
warehouses where the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party is
piling up pre-election gifts like bicycles, sewing machines and
sacks of cement. Alianza Civica also distributed copies of a letter
allegedly written by an official in the southern state of Chiapas
ordering government employees to attend ruling-party campaign
rallies and paying for the bus to get them there.
</P>
<P>
   But the official, Francisco Cueto, denied having written the
letters. He called them ''a fake'' and said the government-paid bus
transported only ''fishermen, athletes, social groups we try to
help.''
</P>
<P>
   PRI officials did not immediately return phone calls seeking
comment about the voter lists.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations come as the ruling party, known by the acronym
PRI, is facing one of the toughest challenges to its 71 years in
power. Labastida is in a statistical dead heat with Vicente Fox of
the conservative National Action Party, according to most recent
polls.
</P>
<P>
   PRI denies it is violating rules. It has forbidden the use of
government funds for campaigns, and it says voters are too smart to
be bought by pressure or promises.
</P>
<P>
   ''People aren't stupid,'' said Social Development Secretary
Carlos Jarque. Jarque said his agency has received less than a
half-dozen complaints of political use of government funds and has
yet to find any evidence to support them.
</P>
<P>
   The official Federal Electoral Institute, the independent
watchdog agency, says it has received 12 complaints of vote-buying
or pressure tactics, 10 against the PRI and two against opposition
parties.
</P>
<P>
   But activists are preparing to submit dozens more complaints.
And the PRI has many faces -- front groups such as the Territorial
Movement, which helps implement rural public works projects and
then passes credit for them on to the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people don't know where our movement ends and the PRI
begins,'' said Wintilo Vega, a leader of the Territorial Movement.
''We are the new face of the PRI.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say recent changes in Mexico's anti-poverty programs
made them more likely to be used as campaign fodder. The former
Solidarity program -- a pork-barrel operation that handed out aid to
communities -- has been replaced in part by individual-aid programs
under President Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of the these programs are directed toward individuals,
which makes them more potentially subject to manipulation,'' said
Meyer Brownstone, one of the Canadian observers.
</P>
<P>
   And as hard as it is to detect illegal electoral tactics, it's
even harder to punish them, despite sweeping reforms in electoral
law. The Federal Electoral Institute says it needs more money to
investigate the cases, stiffer enforcement practices and clearer
laws on what's acceptable politicking and what's not.

<HEADLINE> No civil rights charges in police killing of black man  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - A federal investigation has found no
basis for civil rights charges against the white policemen who
killed a young black man in Ossining two years ago, the U.S.
attorney announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The killing brought to a boil the simmering antagonism between
some blacks and the police in Ossining, a village of 22,000 best
known for the maximum-security Sing Sing prison.
</P>
<P>
   The federal decision is consistent with the finding of a
Westchester grand jury, which voted not to indict officers Raymond
DeBenedictus, Richard Damiano and Daniel Slater, all of whom are
still on the Ossining force.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Malone, 24, was shot and killed on James Street in
the predawn hours of July 19, 1998, after police were told that he
had fired a gun nearby. When police arrived, saw Malone and
directed him to stop, he ran away and the officers chased him, the
grand jury found.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, Malone turned toward the officers and pointed a
.40-caliber handgun at them. Police fired and killed him.
</P>
<P>
   That night, about 200 angry people gathered outside police
headquarters, expressing doubts about police motives at a hastily
called meeting of the Board of Trustees.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Brooks, a former head of Ossining's NAACP chapter, called
the killing ''an execution.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a policeman's dream, shooting a black man,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Malone's mother, Renee, expressed outrage at reports her son had
been shot five to 10 times, but urged witnesses to cooperate with
the investigation. Authorities never publicly disclosed how many
times Malone was shot.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said the federal investigation
failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers
specifically intended to use unreasonable force.
</P>
<P>
   Village attorney Thomas Barnes said, ''We're pleased with the
finding and it conforms to our own analysis of the facts of the
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that a civil case is pending - Mrs. Malone has sued the
village and the officers for $20 million - he said the federal
finding ''can't hurt the village.''
</P>
<P>
   Regina Darby, lawyer for the mother, said, ''This is not the
first time that a DA's office or the federal government have failed
to seriously examine and become involved in police activities.''
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Jeanine Pirro said, ''The Malone family bears
a terrible loss here, but we believe that the finding is consistent
with the finding of the Westchester grand jury two years ago. ...
The police officers in this case acted in a manner that was
consistent with the law and we hope this can bring closure to all
involved.''

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Seeks Action in Congo  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
recommended Tuesday that the Security Council demand the immediate
withdrawal of Ugandan and Rwandan troops from Congo and impose
sanctions if they refuse to go.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats said they expect the council to approve a
resolution this week demanding such a pullout. The comments came
after days of fighting between Rwanda and Uganda in the northern
Congolese town of Kisangani that left an estimated 150 civilians
dead, more than 1,000 injured and extensive property damage.
</P>
<P>
   Annan asked the council to act under Chapter 7 of the U.N.
Charter, which allows for a variety of escalating measures -- from
diplomatic and economic sanctions to military enforcement as a
final option. The secretary-general has sanctions in mind as an
option if Rwanda and Uganda reject the council's call, U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
   Annan also urged the council to demand the subsequent withdrawal
of all other foreign forces in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda, Uganda and other neighboring nations have been in Congo
taking sides in the central African nation's 22-month-old civil
war. Congo President Laurent Kabila has received support from
Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe. Rwanda and Uganda, meanwhile, took
the side of rival rebel groups, which should have made them allies
against Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rwanda-Uganda alliance fell apart, and the two sides
have clashed several times in Kisangani. Annan said troops from the
two countries must be held accountable for deaths, injuries and
destruction in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general's request for the council to act marked a
toughening of U.N. resolve to get all parties in Congo to implement
a cease-fire signed last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council has authorized a 5,537-strong U.N. force to
monitor the cease-fire, but deployment depends on security
guarantees. So far, the U.N. mission in Congo only has about 200
unarmed military observers and liaison officers.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said none of the conditions to start deploying the force
in July as planned have been met: The parties are not adhering to
the cease-fire or cooperating with U.N. personnel, U.N. staff
members don't have freedom of movement and troops being offered to
the U.N. mission don't have adequate strength, equipment and
training.

<HEADLINE> Senate says it is in stretch run of 2000 session  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - People who abandon newborns in hospitals or
other settings where the safety of the babies is not imperiled
would not face prosecution under a bill unanimously passed Tuesday
in the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was one of scores of bills approved as the Senate
held what its leader said was its next-to-last meeting of the 2000
session.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly's passage of legislation also quickened after weeks
of leisurely activity as members of that house hoped to get the
bills they favored over to the Senate in time for consideration by
that chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Nancy Larraine Hoffmann, a Republican from Onondaga County,
said the abandoned baby bill will save lives. New mothers who
because of their age or distraught mental state are inclined to
abandon babies in trash bins might get newborns into safe hands if
they knew they would not be prosecuted as criminals, Hoffmann said.
</P>
<P>
   The message the bill would convey to such parents is, ''We will
welcome you and we will not ask questions if you need that
anonymity. We will not ask questions if you deliver that infant
safely up to three days old,'' Hoffmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John DeFrancisco, R-Syracuse, voted for the bill but said
it does not define thoroughly enough what an ''appropriate''
setting is for a baby to be left in so a parent can avoid
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   DeFrancisco said the measure appeared to him to be at ''great
risk'' of being declared unconstitutionally vague by courts.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffmann said she believes the abandoned baby bill will be
approved by both the Democrat-controlled state Assembly and Gov.
George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally Tuesday, a newborn was surrendered at Seton
Health-St. Mary's Hospital in Troy under ''Project Safe Haven.'' It
is a program entered into by prosecutors and other authorities in
nine Albany-area counties including Rensselaer County District
Attorney Kenneth Bruno. He is son of the Senate's Republican leader
Joseph Bruno.
</P>
<P>
   As has become his habit, Joseph Bruno said he would stick to a
self-imposed deadline for the ''completion'' of his chamber's
regular session. Six months ago, he set this Wednesday, June 14, as
the last day of the Senate's meeting this year.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno's insistence on adhering to such deadlines is designed to
compel the Assembly and the governor to make final deals on issues
under negotiation or face the prospect of the Senate leaving town
without passing those agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno said the Legislature has been in session for 5{ months
this year and ''we shouldn't be now in a mad, mad rush.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Yet I think if we were here another month, we would be in the
same mode,'' Bruno told radio station WROW-AM in Albany Tuesday.
''Unfortunately, the Legislature seems to need a crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruno said talks over some major issues facing lawmakers have
''lagged.''
</P>
<P>
   If past years have been any guide, the Senate will come back
into session for a day or two later in the year to ratify deals
made with the Assembly and governor after senators break for the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, Bruno and state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver all said
Tuesday they had long ''wish'' lists of bills they want to see
passed before the legislative session ends.
</P>
<P>
   ''My to-do list is so long that if the Legislature started
passing bills today I don't think that it could be done three days
from now,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the major issues outstanding Tuesday were agreements over
a bill to toughen penalties for crimes committed by bigoted
offenders, to impose more controls over the sale of guns, to
toughen penalties for sex assaults and school violence, to expand
DNA testing of criminals and to give automatic cost-of-living
increases to state and local government retirees.
</P>
<P>
   In other legislative actions Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   -The Senate approved a bill expanding from $100,000 to $150,000
the size of the maximum raffle award which can be offered by
nonprofit groups in New York.
</P>
<P>
   -The Assembly passed a bill to give people falsely accused of
abusing a child a way to appeal to the state to get their names
removed from the state's sex abuse registry. Currently, people's
names remain on the registry for 10 years, even if the accusations
against them are found to be baseless.
</P>
<P>
   -The Assembly gave final legislative approval to a bill allowing
the victims of slave labor camps run by Nazi Germany or their heirs
to recover damages in court. The measure would waive the state's
statute of limitations for filing suits for the World War II-era
human rights abuses in labor camps.
</P>
<P>
   -Youth sports coaches would have to undergo background checks
designed to weed out sex offenders and child abusers under a
measure passed by the Senate and sent to the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   -The Assembly passed another bill requiring the sale of
''fire-safe'' cigarettes in New York. It would replace the one
vetoed last month by Pataki and is written to address some of the
governor's objections to the first bill. The measure would give
tobacco companies six more months to comply with the law, to
October 2002, and also prohibit the marketing of any
self-extinguishing cigarettes which are more dangerous than he
conventional cigarettes currently on the market.

<HEADLINE> State Senate passes casino gambling bill  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The state Senate Tuesday unanimously passed
a bill requiring legislative and local approval before Indian
tribes can open gambling casinos on non-tribal lands.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would apply to construction of new casinos on
off-reservation lands once they are approved by the federal
government. It would also prevent the state's governor to exert
executive authority over casino construction.
</P>
<P>
   ''This legislation would assure that there is sufficient state
and local input into any gaming contracts for a casino on
non-tribal lands,'' Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno said in a
prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Padavan, a Queens Republican, voted in favor of the
bill but said he favored a broader application to include both on-
and off-reservation lands.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bill goes only so far. It should go all the way,''
Padavan said. ''Whether the casino is located on (tribal) property
or away, there's absolutely no difference in terms of the
socio-economic impact to the area.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate legislation is similar to a measure proposed by Gov.
George Pataki in March, but it does not include legalizing
traditional slot machines in the casinos - a key provision in
Pataki's bill.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said Tuesday that he's ''concerned'' that slot machines
was not included in the bill. Pataki has said that it's not clear
whether a ban on slots in the state constitution applies to Indian
casinos. He said that his version would have cleared up those
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that it's very important if we're going to have
successful casinos ... that would be able to compete with casinos
from other surrounding jurisdictions,'' Pataki said. ''I'm
disappointed it's not in the bill.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he would support a bill that excluded slot
machines, Pataki answered: ''I have reservations without that
language in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would still need approval from the Assembly before it
goes to the Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Carrier, a spokesman for Assembly Speaker Sheldon
Silver, said the chamber has a bill matching the Senate's version,
''but we have not made a decision yet on what we're going to do
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver had previously supported bills that would have limited
casinos to traditional tourism areas such as Sullivan and Ulster
counties in the Catskills and Niagara Falls.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Regis Mohawk Nation has received federal approval to
build a casino on the Monticello Raceway in Sullivan County, about
90 miles northwest of New York City. But it was still uncertain
what would become of that deal after tribal leaders signed a
separate agreement with Park Place Entertainment, the world's
largest gambling company, to build a casino at a Catskill resort
separate from the raceway.

<HEADLINE> Paraguayan Fugitive Seeks Transfer  </HEADLINE>
By STAN LEHMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- The attorney for a former Paraguayan
army chief facing murder charges called for his client to be moved
to a military post Tuesday, saying police can't protect him.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gen. Gen. Lino Oviedo was arrested in Brazil Sunday in
connection with the 1999 killing of his nation's vice president. He
is being held in a federal police jail in Brazil's capital, where
he was awaiting a ruling on his extradition to Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a price on my client's head,'' attorney Inemar Penna
Marinho said by phone. ''And the facilities at the federal police
are just not secure enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Marinho said he will ask the Supreme Court to order the
transfer.
</P>
<P>
   ''His opponents in Paraguay have offered to pay $1 million if he
is bought back alive and $2 million if he is returned dead,''
Marinho said. ''An army barracks would provide more safety and the
comfort a prisoner of his status deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   A former presidential candidate, Oviedo is accused of plotting
the killing of Vice President Luis Argana. He was also convicted of
leading an unsuccessful coup in 1996, and was suspected of planning
another on May 18 of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Oviedo was flown to Brasilia on Monday, following his arrest in
Foz do Iguacu -- a tourist resort on the southwest border with
Paraguay and Argentina. Brazilian police had been searching for him
since May 26, when the Supreme Court issued a warrant at Paraguay's
request.
</P>
<P>
   Paraguay has 90 days to formally request Oviedo's extradition,
or the general goes free, Supreme Court spokesman Gerson Matos
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Paraguayan government may take several days to file the
request, said Paraguay Embassy official Jorge Figueredo. ''We must
be sure that the request details all the charges against Oviedo.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing arguments from both sides, the federal attorney
general will give an opinion on the extradition, and the Supreme
Court will make the decision.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Oviedo is sharing a cell with two Brazilians
drug traffickers and a German awaiting extradition on charges of
attempted homicide, federal police chief Romulo Berredo said. The
two-story concrete prison building was housing about 40 inmates,
mostly on drug-trafficking charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''So far he has proven to be a model prisoner,'' Berredo said.
''He is extremely polite.''
</P>
<P>
   Oviedo was sentenced once in Paraguay to a 10-year prison term
for the 1996 coup attempt, but was released after only six months
by then-President Raul Cubas.
</P>
<P>
   He went into exile in Argentina, but vanished on Dec. 9, a day
before the country's new president, Fernando de la Rua, took
office. De la Rua had said he would consider Paraguay's request for
extradition, which his predecessor had rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Paraguayan authorities said intelligence agents traced his phone
calls to Foz do Iguacu.

<HEADLINE> New Jersey's jobless rate edges up slightly in April  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey's jobless rate held steady in
May at 3.8 percent, unchanged from April, according to labor
statistics released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The state's unemployment rate has hovered around or below the
U.S. rate, which was 4.1 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey posted job gains totaling 10,000 from April to May,
according to state labor officials.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the job growth came from federal jobs related to the
census, officials said. The public sector added a total of 8,400
jobs in New Jersey over the month, a growth fueled primarily by
temporary census-taking positions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only job growth in the nation was all census-related,''
said Kevin Smith, state labor department spokesman. ''Nationally,
private sector jobs actually dropped in May. In New Jersey, we had
a slight increase in private sector jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The private sector added 1,600 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest private sector increase was in the service area,
which posted 2,600 new jobs. Research and development, testing
laboratories and management and public relations led the growth in
this area.
</P>
<P>
   Construction jobs were also up by 900. This was the fastest pace
of growth since 4,300 construction jobs were added in the first
five months of 1994, labor officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturing industry lost 600 jobs. Jobholding in
transportation/communications/public utilities also dropped by
1,100 over the month. The decrease was mostly in the communications
sector.
</P>
<P>
   April was the 32nd straight month that the state's unemployment
rate remained under 5 percent, labor officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Since January 1994, New Jersey employers have added 423,600
jobs.

tried to kill Pope John Paul II in 1981, and he was immediately
delivered to authorities in Turkey -- taking with him the answers to
the mysterious assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pardon, Mehmet Ali Agca must now serve time in
Turkey for a killing that took place before the attack on the pope.
</P>
<P>
   Agca, white-haired after nearly two decades in jail, left the
Italian prison where he had been held after dark Tuesday, under
heavy guard and carrying nothing but an armful of books.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived at Istanbul's Ataturk International Airport early
Wednesday. Police backed by armored personnel carriers blocked off
the gate where he landed, CNN-Turk reported.
</P>
<P>
   In his last hours in Italy, Agca offered profuse thanks to the
pope, who had personally forgiven and comforted his would-be killer
during a 1983 visit to Agca's prison cell. The Vatican in recent
days had reassured the government that John Paul supported the act
of clemency.
</P>
<P>
   ''That the granting of pardon comes during Holy Year
celebrations makes the pope's personal satisfaction even more
intense,'' papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said.
</P>
<P>
   On May 13, 1981, Agca pulled a trigger twice as John Paul rode
smiling and waving in an open car through excited throngs of
pilgrims in St. Peter's Square.
</P>
<P>
   One shot hit the pope's abdomen, barely missing vital organs.
Doctors say the wound forever weakened the pope, then an athletic
hiker and skier, now a frail, stooped 80-year-old suffering from
symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   The former Soviet bloc was immediately suspected in the attack --
suspicions that lingered over the years despite denials by former
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and the one-time spy chief for
the former East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Soviet spy chiefs were seen as fearing the adamantly
anti-communist pope would spur popular revolts against the Soviet
bloc -- as John Paul in fact did, above all in his native Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Agca had told investigators he acted at the instigation of the
Bulgarian secret service and the Soviet KGB. But Italian courts
ruled there was insufficient evidence to support the accusations,
and Agca himself went on to give widely varying accounts during his
19 years and one month behind bars in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Agca purposefully feigned insanity in court to cast doubt on the
credibility of his own stories, a prosecutor said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This extinguishes the last hope of reaching the truth,''
prosecutor Antonio Marini said of the pardon and extradition.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Rosario Priore, who investigated the alleged
conspiracy between Bulgarian agents and Agca, agreed that the truth
has never emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Priore insisted, the pardon was the correct move.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the only possible act to take,'' Priore said. ''You can't
keep people in prison just to make them talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Agca, now 42, smiled in relief when Tuesday's news reached his
prison at Ancona, in eastern Italy, lawyer Marina Magistrelli said.
</P>
<P>
   '''It's a dream,''' Magistrelli quoted Agca as exclaiming,
saying he offered thanks to the pope, the Vatican and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul credits the Virgin Mary for sparing his life. The
Vatican said in May that the assassination attempt had been
foretold in a vision seen by three peasant children in Fatima,
Portugal, in 1917 -- the so-called third secret of Fatima.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after the shooting, cameras filmed the white-robed
pontiff visiting a clearly grateful Agca in prison. The heads of
gunman and victim alike were bowed in an intense conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Agca carried out the attack after escaping from prison in
Turkey, where he was being held in the killing of a Turkish
newspaper editor. Turkey later convicted him in absentia in the
killing and sentenced him to death. A 1991 amnesty reduced the
sentence to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   After expiration of that sentence -- minus 158 days served before
his escape -- Turkey will put Agca on trial for a 1979 robbery in
Istanbul, Turkish Justice Minister Hikmet Sami Turk said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wants to go to Turkey, pay his debt there like he did in
Italy and walk out a free man,'' said Magistrelli, Agca's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'll be 50,'' she said. ''That's a whole life spent in
prison.''

<HEADLINE> EPA Exempts Wood Industry From Rule  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a blow to conservationists, the
Environmental Protection Agency said it will exempt loggers, tree
farmers and other forestry operations from a pending rule aimed at
reducing water pollution on private land.
</P>
<P>
   The move is a major victory for the wood products industry,
which aggressively fought the rule. Among other things, critics
sent the EPA 30,000 postcards and held public meetings to encourage
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ''They finally heard the loud uproar across this country ...
that what they were proposing simply wouldn't work,'' Chris West,
vice president of the Northwest Forestry Association in Portland,
Ore., said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA will propose a new rule this fall that would cover
forestry practices, said Charles Fox, assistant EPA administrator
for water. That rule has an uncertain fate: It would be up to a
George W. Bush or Al Gore administration to decide whether to enact
it.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the original rule, which would affect farmers and
other private landowners, should become final in about a month, Fox
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said criticism directed at the forestry portion of the rule
was distracting attention from the overall plan to clean up the
nation's waterways, so the EPA decided last week to make the
exemption.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question that the industry mounted an extremely
aggressive and no doubt expensive campaign,'' he said. ''Much of
the information they put out was not entirely true, if not
downright false in some cases.''
</P>
<P>
   The rule proposed last August requires states to submit plans to
clean up every waterway that fails to meet quality standards for
fishing, drinking and swimming, among other categories.
</P>
<P>
   EPA estimates more than 20,000 streams and lakes don't meet
water-quality standards, or about 40 percent of all lakes, rivers
and streams in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   States would be required to say how much pollution should be
allowed from indirect sources, such as farmers or parking lot
owners who send polluted runoff into streams.
</P>
<P>
   Landowners would be required to get a pollution discharge permit
if the EPA found they were contributing to nearby water quality
problems and if a state had failed to draft an adequate plan for
improving water quality.
</P>
<P>
   Forestry groups said under the rule, private landowners would
need an EPA permit to cut down or even plant trees. The expensive
and time-consuming process would put some small forestry practices
out of business, the groups said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said 99 percent of forestry operations would not have been
affected. Only a few problem polluters would have been required to
get EPA permits, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition also came from states like Washington and Oregon,
which already regulate private forestry lands and say new
regulatory tools are not needed.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., sponsored legislation to exempt
the forestry industry from the rule. Other lawmakers hope to derail
the rest of the proposal before it takes effect.

<HEADLINE> Man admits his ring stole checks from Bank of New York 'lock boxes' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - An Essex County man admitted Tuesday that he
was part of a ring that stole checks being processed by the Bank of
New York in Newark and altered the checks to negotiate them.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of money stolen during the nearly four-year operation
was not immediately disclosed by federal prosecutors and the FBI,
who are continuing to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   The amount could be substantial, based on one specific incident
cited by Justin Jades as he pleaded guilty: in March 1999, he
arranged to buy $224,800 worth of computer parts and electrical
equipment using stolen checks deposited directly into the accounts
of the seller.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his plea bargain, Jades has agreed to cooperate with
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   He said the checks were stolen from Bank of New York ''lock
boxes,'' then altered, and deposited either into accounts he and
others opened under false names, or into the accounts of companies
from which they purchased merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lock boxes'' are not objects that hold checks, it is a term
for a service provided by bankers to business customers who want
incoming checks processed so the money can be deposited quickly
into interest-bearing instruments.
</P>
<P>
   As part of this service, the bank receives checks directly from
those who send the company money, deposits the funds, and informs
the company of who has paid.
</P>
<P>
   Jades, 34, who lived in East Orange before his arrest in August,
pleaded guilty to a single charge of conspiracy to commit bank
fraud. He remains in federal custody at the Union County Jail in
Elizabeth, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Lorraine S. Gerson, who is
prosecuting the case.
</P>
<P>
   He faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine when
sentenced Sept. 7 by U.S. District Judge William H. Walls, although
the actual penalties would be far less.
</P>
<P>
   The plot began about November 1995. In May 1996, Jades rented
office space in Fords, Middlesex County, to establish an address
for new accounts, which he and at least two unnamed others opened
at the Fleet Bank in Concord, N.H., he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jades also obtained a driver's license and birth certificate in
the fictitious name of ''Jim Weda'' to open a bank account, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Camden school board president urges nationwide search for superintendent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - After more than a year without a permanent
school superintendent, the Board of Education president is urging
the board to renew a nationwide search.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that it's time for us to move on,'' President Philip
E. Freeman Sr. told fellow board members at a meeting Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Roy J. Dawson took early retirement last June. In
April 1999, the school board hired Leonard Fitts, a former
consultant to the district who was superintendent in nearby Penns
Grove and dean of students at Cheyney State University in
Pennsylvania, as interim superintendent. He will leave the post
June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Freeman, business manager and school board secretary, said
Tuesday that Fitts, receiving $500 per day, was paid about $133,000
from April 1999 through April 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Several board members support the appointment of Josiha Haig as
superintendent and opposed Philip Freeman's suggestion to create
another search committee.
</P>
<P>
   Haig was superintendent in Hartford, Conn., and East Orange. His
nomination was voted down twice after board members learned he had
not served long enough as a principal to satisfy the board's
requirements. Philip Freeman said appointing Haig could cause legal
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Dwaine Williams said he would introduce Haig's name
for consideration a third time.
</P>
<P>
   The board took no action on creating a search committee Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Freeman also asked the board to appoint a new interim
superintendent until a permanent one is hired.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the district, which is being monitored by the
state, needs to act quickly. He compared it to a sinking ship.
</P>
<P>
   ''This system right now is bow first. You're taking on water,''
Williams said. ''You're the Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Camden is the largest public school district in southern New
Jersey with about 20,000 students.

<HEADLINE> Cancer-stricken umpire visits College World Series  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG ALDEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) - Joe Casalunovo's greatest wish was to umpire
a College World Series game. He can't do that, but the amateur
umpire battling terminal cancer is watching this year's series from
the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Casalunovo, who was diagnosed five years ago with colorectal
cancer that has spread to his lungs and liver, is here as a result
of some sympathetic doctors in Philadelphia and Omaha. The American
Cancer Society and an NCAA umpiring official also helped coordinate
the trip so Casalunovo could at least see a game at Rosenblatt
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's amazing that so many people would put out so much effort
for somebody they don't know,'' Casalunovo said before Tuesday's
game between Clemson and Louisiana-Lafayette.
</P>
<P>
   Casalunovo, of Laurel Heights, N.J., looks and feels healthy.
His black hair and mustache have grown back in the sixth months
since his latest round of chemotherapy and he had no problems
strolling about the ballpark, shaking hands and posing for pictures
with the umpiring crew before Tuesday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ''My reports aren't that good, but I feel and look good,'' he
said. ''I have more energy than I ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Casalunovo's dream of calling a game at Rosenblatt started when
he began watching the College World Series every June and noticed
the emotion the players showed for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''They may make some big bucks down the road, but right now
they're just playing because they love it. They want to be the
best,'' he said. ''That's what the College World Series is all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Even through his chemotherapy, Casalunovo continued to call high
school and Division III college baseball games.
</P>
<P>
   He recently mentioned his umpiring during a conversation with
his oncologist, Dr. Bruce Boman, director of medical oncology and
medical genetics at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.
Casalunovo told Bowman how he enjoys watching the College World
Series each June and how much he would like to umpire a game there.
</P>
<P>
   Boman, the former director of the cancer center at Creighton
University, is a big CWS fan himself and still has some connections
back in Omaha. He called Dr. Alan Thorson, who he served with on
the Heartland Division of the American Cancer Society during their
days in Omaha. The two got to work on getting Casalunovo to Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   They coordinated flights for Casalunovo and his wife, Lorraine.
NCAA national coordinator of umpires Dave Yeast, who lost his
mother to breast cancer, set up the tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ''They got him out here and we'll take him in and show him all
the sites of Omaha,'' Yeast said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeast gave Casalunovo a College World Series tote back and an
NCAA hat before Tuesday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ''This probably wouldn't have fit me six months ago when I
didn't have any hair,'' Casalunovo said.
</P>
<P>
   Casalunovo started following baseball while growing up in South
Philadelphia, going to Phillies games at Connie Mack Stadium and
later The Vet. He kept up with the game as an adult, but did not
get involved in umpiring until 12 years ago when his children were
playing baseball and softball.
</P>
<P>
   Casalunovo enjoyed the few games he called and, at the
suggestion of a neighbor, joined the umpires union. He is qualified
to do high school and small-college games and still gets behind the
plate when he is feeling up to it.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are days when you really do feel good but there is
nothing to do,'' he said. ''Now that I'm sitting around doing
nothing, it's not all it's cracked up to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The five years of treatment have not stopped the cancer from
spreading. Still, Casalunovo is not calling the trip a final wish.
He has remained optimistic throughout his illness and plans to
start a new protein treatment next month.
</P>
<P>
   Casalunovo wants people to be aware of colon cancer and not be
afraid to be checked for it. Casalunovo's uncle died of colon
cancer, but he didn't think much about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a topic everybody is comfortable talking about it,''
he said. ''If my family and I had talked about colon cancer I might
not be here today. I might be at home.''

<HEADLINE> 6 on Leave After Nuke Secrets Gone  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two elder statesmen, respected across party
lines, were named Tuesday to investigate the loss of top-secret
nuclear weapons material at the Los Alamos laboratory. At the same
time, six lab managers, including the head of its weapons program,
were placed on paid leave.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, trying to contain the political
fallout from the disclosure that two computer drives containing
nuclear secrets vanished from a vault at the weapons lab, announced
that former Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker and former Rep. Lee
Hamilton would conduct a separate investigation and make
recommendations to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, six managers at the Los Alamos lab in New Mexico,
were placed on administrative leave with pay, pending the outcome
of various investigations of the incident. Neither lab or Energy
Department officials would comment on the action or identify the
individuals. It was learned by The Associated Press that among
those put on leave was Stephen Younger, head of the nuclear weapons
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The individuals were placed on leave with pay to ensure the
independence and complete appearance of independence of a
University of California review that will look at management
performance and practices in connection with the security
incident,'' lab spokesman John Gustafson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will not tolerate security lapses and I'm outraged at what
happened,'' said Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who did not
learn of the missing nuclear weapons files for about a month. He
said he doubts that espionage or theft was involved and said the
two computer drives probably were ''misplaced'' during the turmoil
surrounding the wildfires that threatened the lab last month.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said that Clinton looked
forward to getting recommendations from Baker and Hamilton. Baker
after a long Senate career was White House chief of staff under
President Reagan. Hamilton, an Indiana Democrat, is a respected
voice on security issues and former chairman of the House
International Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of the top-secret computer drives, containing
information about how to dismantle both U.S. and Russian nuclear
devices, has prompted sharp criticism in Congress. Already a string
of hearings are scheduled this week in both the Senate and House to
questions lab and Energy Department officials about the
embarrassing security lapse, which could blow into a major
political problem for the administration and for Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, who spent most of last year defusing a security flap
involving fired Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee, came under sharp
criticism Tuesday for the latest incident, although he apparently
didn't know about it until a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''This incident occurred on his watch. He'll have to be held
accountable,'' said Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Armed
Services Committee. Warner said his committee planned a hearing
Thursday on the missing nuclear material and both Richardson and
Los Alamos lab director John Browne were to testify.
</P>
<P>
   The drives were found missing from a metal container in a highly
secure vault in the Los Alamos lab's ''X Division'' complex where
nuclear bomb designers work. The discovery was made late in the
evening on May 7 as scientists sought to secure them from a massive
wildfire threatening the lab complex. Energy Department officials
did not learn of the disappearance for 24 days, until June 1.
</P>
<P>
   During that time both Richardson and his top ''security czar,''
retired Air Force Gen. Eugene Habiger, flew to Los Alamos because
of the wildfires. Neither, however, was given a hint that nuclear
secrets may have been compromised, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm most concerned about the failure of the lab to promptly
notify ... when these potential (security) breaches took place. ...
The lab is going to have to have some good explanations,''
Richardson told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The two drives, about the size of a deck of cards and each
containing identical information, were used by the Nuclear
Emergency Search Team, or NEST, which is trained to respond to
nuclear accidents or terrorist acts. The drives, which can be used
in a laptop computer, contain highly technical nuclear weapons data
needed to disarm and dismantle nuclear devices.
</P>
<P>
   Habiger, tapped last year by Richardson to be the department's
''security czar,'' said only 26 people had authority to enter the
vault.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of such sensitive top-secret nuclear files
opened the way Tuesday for renewed attacks from Republicans on
Energy Department security, especially at the nuclear labs. The
department came under attack most of last year for lax security at
the labs and allegations that it botched the Lee investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was arrested last December and charged with illegally
copying secret computer files. The files have never been found and
he is awaiting trial. He was never charged with espionage, although
suspected for three years of possibly giving secrets to China. He
has denied giving secrets to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest security matter, Richardson said his security and
counterintelligence experts ''believe that these drives have been
misplaced'' during the ''strain and confusion'' caused by last
month's wildfires that destroyed thousands of acres and homes as
well as damaging the lab complex.
</P>
<P>
   But some lawmakers are not as convinced.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., a member of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, said there was ''physical evidence to suggest theft,''
but he declined to elaborate. Kyl, a sharp critic of DOE's security
of nuclear materials, called the lost computer drives an
''unacceptable security breach.''

<HEADLINE> Solomon Island Premier Resigns  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONIARA, Solomon Islands (AP) -- The prime minister of the
Solomon Islands has resigned ahead of a no-confidence vote forced
by armed rebels who seized the capital, local media said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Solomons Minister of State Alfred Sasako said Prime Minister
Bartholomew Ulufa'alu resigned late Tuesday, but would remain in
charge of the country until parliament meets Thursday to elect a
new leader, according to local radio and Australian news reports.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Ulufa'alu told The Associated Press that he would
resign despite fears that quitting would ignite a new round of
rebel fighting that could splinter this South Pacific nation.
</P>
<P>
   Australian Associated Press reported from Honiara that Sasako
said Ulufa'alu's Cabinet would stay in place until the parliament
elects a new prime minister, but would implement no policy
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear whether the Solomons' head of
state, Governor-general Sir John Eni Lapli, had received or
accepted Ulufa'alu's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   In the exclusive AP interview, Ulufa'alu said that rebels who
seized the capital last week were threatening his government and
the only safe option was to step down.
</P>
<P>
   He said the planned no-confidence vote on his leadership,
planned for Thursday, was a ''sheer mockery of democracy'' because
the well-armed militants forced the special session of parliament
to give their coup a veneer of legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's planned vote was the result of a deal with rebels who
seized Ulufa'alu at gunpoint June 5 and demanded that he resign. A
few days later, they released him and allowed him to stay in office
until the parliament decided his future.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions have been growing since 18 months ago when indigenous
Guadalcanal residents, called Isatabus, began forcing out migrants
from the nearby island of Malaita. About 20,000 thousand Malaitans
have been expelled.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a group of Malaitans raided an armory and teamed up
with Malaitans in the police and paramilitary troops. The fighters,
whose ranks include about 500 people in the capital, were the ones
who detained Ulufa'alu at gunpoint and demanded he resign.
</P>
<P>
   After less than a week of fighting, the Malaitans drove the
outgunned Isatabus out of the capital and into the surrounding
hills. Though both sides have honored an unwritten truce since late
last week and looting has been rare, thousands of foreigners and
locals have flooded out of the capital.

<HEADLINE> 3 Charged For Lying in Swayze Probe  </HEADLINE>
By ALISA BLACKWOOD
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Three men were charged with lying Tuesday for
allegedly failing to tell police that they helped Patrick Swayze
remove beer and wine from his plane before driving him to a hotel
after he made an emergency landing.
</P>
<P>
   Swayze's publicist, Annett Wolf in Los Angeles, denied there was
alcohol on the plane. ''It's unfortunate that there were people
there who felt the need to say what they said,'' Wolf said.
</P>
<P>
   After the actor landed his 1978 twin-engine Cessna 414A on June
1, police were unable to question him for 12 hours, when he
returned messages left on his cell phone. The National
Transportation Safety Board had instructed police to get a
toxicology report from Swayze, according to the police report.
</P>
<P>
   The actor was unhurt when he landed on a road where a
subdivision is to be built in Prescott Valley, about 90 miles north
of Phoenix. He hit a light pole, tearing off part of a wing.
</P>
<P>
   The three men, charged with giving false information, said they
helped the actor remove a half-empty 30-pack of beer and a
near-empty bottle of wine from the plane before bringing him to a
hotel, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Nelson, Adam Martin and Joshua Angel face the misdemeanor
charge for initially telling police they didn't witness the
incident. The three didn't return phone calls seeking comment. All
were cited and released.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesman Sgt. P.J. Janik said there isn't enough
evidence to charge Swayze. Wolf said Swayze contacted the Federal
Aviation Administration after landing.
</P>
<P>
   Swayze told the FAA he was forced to land because of
pressurization problems.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Crispin, an investigator for the National Transportation
Safety Board, confirmed that investigators found a fault in the
pressurization system that would cause symptoms, such as a loud
noise, similar to what Swayze described.
</P>
<P>
   Crispin said investigators found no evidence of alcohol in
Swayze's plane.
</P>
<P>
   Swayze, 47, has starred in movies including ''Ghost,'' a hit
with Demi Moore, and ''Dirty Dancing,'' the 1987 movie that helped
launch his career.

Former Bernardo Lawyer Ken Murray Acquitted
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. CATHARINES, Ontario (AP) -- Kenneth Murray's five years of
''hell on earth'' ended abruptly Tuesday as a judge acquitted the
former lawyer for sex killer Paul Bernardo of obstructing justice.
</P>
<P>
   Ontario Superior Court Justice Patrick Gravely said there was a
reasonable doubt Murray intended to impede the course of justice by
forever keeping Bernardo's gruesome sex-and-torture videotapes from
those trying convict him.
</P>
<P>
   Under Canada's Criminal Code, it must be proven an accused
willfully obstructed justice to be convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a dearth of similar cases, the Murray trial sets a
precedent for lawyers who are forced to deal with evidence that is
incriminating but also potentially helpful to their client's
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Gravely said it's possible, albeit hard to believe, that Murray
intended to use Bernardo's ''indescribably horrible'' videotapes to
defend his client.
</P>
<P>
   That casts doubt on the Crown's position that Murray -- who held
the tapes for more than 16 months after plucking them from
Bernardo's St. Catharines home in May 1993 -- planned to forever
keep them secret.

Amended Bank Law Strikes Balance Between Banks, Consumers: Martin
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Changes to financial service laws have balanced
the needs of consumers with the demands by Canada's banks and
insurance companies to be permitted to grow, Finance Minister Paul
Martin said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the result is uneven, critics complained as Martin unveiled
the massive and long-awaited amendments to Canada's banking and
insurance rules.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition Canadian Alliance MPs complained the balance tipped
too far toward increasing the regulatory burden on banks.
</P>
<P>
   The NDP warned the legislation risks Canada's financial
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin maintained the bill -- with the heft of a big-city
telephone book -- was dynamic, flexible and fair.

Woman Killed on Highway Remembered As Mother, Top-Notch Police
Officer
</P>
<P>
   CHATHAM, Ontario (AP) -- To her fellow officers, Sgt. Marg Eve
was known as a top-notch police officer with extraordinary
compassion and expert negotiating skills.
</P>
<P>
   But the 38-year-old, who died last week after a gruesome
accident on Canada's busiest highway, was also celebrated Tuesday
as a strong woman with an infectious laugh whose greatest joy was
raising her two small children.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of police officers from across North America solemnly
filed into a small hockey arena to commemorate the life of Eve, who
died from massive head injuries at a London, Ontario, hospital
Friday, two days after a tractor-trailer hit three police cruisers
and another vehicle stopped on the side of Highway 401.
</P>
<P>
   She is the first female officer in Ontario to be killed while on
duty.

<HEADLINE> Politics on TV: Lots of ads, little talk of issues  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Campaign commercials are overwhelming
broadcast news coverage of the presidential election, meaning
voters are getting more political spin than discussion of issues,
two studies conclude.
</P>
<P>
   In the first four months of the year, broadcasters in the top 75
media markets took in more than $114 million from more than 151,000
political ads, according to a report by the Alliance for Better
Campaigns, which advocates free television time for political
candidates. And by the time voters cast ballots on Nov. 7, TV
stations are expected to pocket some $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, both network and local news shows included very
little substantive political coverage to balance the deluge of
advertising, according to a corollary report by the Norman Lear
Center at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University
of Southern California and the Annenberg Public Policy Center at
the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Stations only got credit for time spent with candidates
discussing issues, not reporting on strategy that dominates
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The study examined 19 local TV stations in 11 cities and found:
</P>
<P>
   -The typical local TV station aired less than one minute of
candidates discussing issues each night. Sixteen of the stations
aired, on average, 39 seconds per night in the 30 days before a
primary.
</P>
<P>
   -Three stations involved in special election projects launched
by their owners offered much more coverage. WCVB in Boston averaged
4 minutes 19 seconds per night; WEWS in Cleveland averaged 3
minutes 49 seconds; and WMUR in Manchester, N.H., averaged 3
minutes 12 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Network news was even more paltry in its coverage, the Annenberg
study concluded. ABC, NBC and CBS aired a nightly average of just
36 seconds of candidates discussing issues, but spent more time
reporting on campaign strategy.
</P>
<P>
   For CBS, 77 percent of the stories were horse race coverage of
who's winning and who's losing. For NBC, it was 66 percent; for
ABC, 68 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On the local level, the report used last week's New Jersey
Senate primary to dramatize its point.
</P>
<P>
   TV stations in New York and Philadelphia collected $21 million
from candidates, but top-rated stations serving the state featured
just 13 seconds per night of candidate discourse.

<HEADLINE> Wagering board nominee defends her independent status  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki's nominee for the state
Racing and Wagering Board was confirmed by the Republican-led state
Senate Tuesday following a debate on the chamber's floor that ended
with a vote strictly along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Ritchko-Buley, the former chairwoman of the defunct
Freedom Party who was once enrolled as a Republican, said she will
''immerse myself in racing and wagering'' to make up for what she
lacks in experience.
</P>
<P>
   She was confirmed by the Senate 36-25, with all the Democrats
voting against Pataki's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Her nomination by the Republican governor came under scrutiny
when Democratic senators questioned her political affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Martin Connor said Ritchko-Buley's
appointment will ''defy the spirit'' of the state law, which
prohibits all three members of the Racing and Wagering Board from
belonging to the same political party. The board's other two
members, Chairman Michael Hoblock and Joseph Neglia, are both
registered Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm confident that she's a faithful Republican,'' Connor, a
Brooklyn Democrat, said of Pataki's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Ritchko-Buley, not enrolled in a political party, filed forms
Monday to retain that independent status and thus qualify for the
$101,600-a-year job. When her family moved to their Slingerlands
home last year, Ritchko-Buley said she enrolled as a Republican
after the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, whom Ritchko-Buley worked
for in 1985-86, countered Connor's criticism and said, ''I don't
think it's appropriate to get personal and get political.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm in the chamber just indicating that Mrs. Buley is an
intelligent, personable and very dignified lady,'' Bruno added.
''She has a background in dealing with very difficult issues ...
and is bright enough to learn everything she doesn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate on the Senate floor was an extension of what happened
at a meeting of the chamber's gaming, wagering and racing committee
earlier Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yesterday it became apparent that she wouldn't meet the
requirement, so she changed her enrollment,'' Sen. Richard
Dollinger said in the meeting. ''The one qualification that this
nominee must have ... is that she can't be Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Dollinger, a Rochester Democrat, argued that Ritchko-Buley would
not have become an independent again ''unless you have a purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Ritchko-Buley became chairwoman of the Freedom Party, a
creation of the state Republican Party to add another party line
backing Pataki during his first run for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Ritchko-Buley's husband, Jeffrey Buley, is a lawyer for the
state Republican Chairman William Powers and has a lobbying
partnership with Albert Pirro. Pirro, a lobbyist and developer who
is married to Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro,
is being tried in federal court in White Plains for tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   When questioned by Dollinger what her political affiliation was
prior to joining the Freedom Party, Ritchko-Buley paused before
answering, ''I was enrolled as a Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   But she insisted that she has been unenrolled after the Freedom
Party was disbanded in 1997 ''and I remained as such to this day.''
</P>
<P>
   After working for Bruno, Ritchko-Buley moved to public relations
firms in Albany and Boston. She said she had to essentially learn
about each client's issues in her public relations work, a skill
she intends to apply to her new job.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm fully confident of my ability to study and consider all
sides of the issue in a nonpartisan way,'' she said. ''I'd devote
myself to this new and exciting endeavor.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican senators on the committee urged members to focus on
Ritchko-Buley's qualifications and questioned if state laws were
violated when Ritchko-Buley's enrollment records were made public.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman William Larkin Jr., R-Orange, said that the
state Board of Election regulations prohibits enrollment records
from becoming public until after the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin told Dollinger: ''If that box wasn't open to you, that
information would not be available.''
</P>
<P>
   Dollinger countered that he obtained the information from
Jeffrey Buley and added: ''If I were a blank, I would never go
there (Albany County Board of Elections) to reaffirm my
blankness.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats wanted the governor to reappoint Bennett Liebman, a
Democrat who has served two six-year terms on the board. Liebman's
term expired in February.
</P>
<P>
   Connor said Liebman is ''nationally recognized'' and by
confirming Ritchko-Buley, ''we're sending the wrong message to
people in the racing industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritchko-Buley will be the first woman to serve on the
three-member board.
</P>
<P>
   The Wagering and Racing Board oversees all the state's legalized
gambling activities, including thoroughbred and harness horse
racing and off-track betting, except for the state Lottery.

<HEADLINE> Reno To Seek Criminal Deportation  </HEADLINE>
By TONY FRASER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno
said Tuesday she will seek agreements with other nations clarifying
U.S. policy on the deportation of criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Reno signed such an agreement Monday with Trinidad. Speaking
here Tuesday during a meeting of law enforcement officials from the
Caribbean, Canada and Britain, Reno said she wanted an ''enhanced
partnership'' with more countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''My hope is that we can work together with everyone,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. authorities' deportations of people from other countries
who commit crimes in the United States have been a sore point for
Caribbean countries, who complain they are being flooded with
U.S.-trained criminals. Because the inmates have not been charged
in their home countries, local police usually have to let them
loose -- even if they are violent offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Under the pact signed by Reno and Trinidadian Prime Minister
Basdeo Panday, the United States promised to better identify
deportees and the charges against them. It also pledged to send
deportees back on commercial flights instead of charters when
possible. Immigration officials in many countries have complained
that the unscheduled charter planes dump deportees on them without
warning.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Trinidad agreed to issue travel papers within five
working days for inmates who have documents proving their
Trinidadian citizenship. For those without proof, immigration
officials agreed to investigate and issue papers within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   But Jamaican Attorney General Arnold Nicholson said the United
States also should fund adjustment and training programs for the
deportees.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope to move beyond the Trinidad agreement and get the U.S.
to finance the rehabilitation of these criminals that it returns to
Jamaica,'' Nicholson said. He said the United States sent 1,359
convicts back to Jamaica last year.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the two-day meeting, the countries issued a
15-point statement pledging to share draft anti-drug legislation,
consider creation of a regional center to share intelligence and
set standards for seizing property.

<HEADLINE> Judge fines bridge painting company over lead exposure by employees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) - A bridge painting company has been ordered to
pay a criminal fine of $210,000 for falsifying reports to make
employees' lead blood levels look legally acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Damalos Inc., a Tarpon Springs company, sent five bogus
laboratory reports to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health
Administration in November 1998, investigators said. The results
had been altered so the lead levels appeared to meet federal
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The reports showed workers had lead paint levels ranging from
six to 29 micrograms of lead per deciliter of whole blood,
according to a plea agreement. However, the workers tested at
levels from 45 to 73 micrograms, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA regulations require employers to take action if levels
reach 40 micrograms or higher.
</P>
<P>
   Had OSHA known, it would have required the painters be
temporarily sidelined, said George Tragos, attorney for the company
located about 35 miles northwest of Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a situation where the company thought it was helping
to keep its people employed,'' Tragos said. None of the Damalos
workers suffered any ''documented injury'' as a result of the
exposure, he maintained.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge James D. Whittemore ordered the fine Monday
and placed the company on three years probation, but said he would
not require officers to check in with probation, unless OSHA
reported a problem.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA and the FBI investigated last year after OSHA received a
complaint that a Damalos worker had lead poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   The fine ordered by Whittemore was higher than federal
sentencing guidelines, but the judge agreed with prosecutors the
amount was appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The conduct of the defendant presented a potential danger to
the community through its work force,'' Whittemore said.
</P>
<P>
   Damalos &AMP; Sons Inc. - an associated but separate corporation -
earlier agreed to pay OSHA $290,000 in fines by Jan. 1 for two
other regulatory cases involving lead exposure, Tragos said.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies are owned by Tony Damalos.
</P>
<P>
   Lead poisoning can cause sterility or kidney failure and can
damage a person's central nervous system. In severe cases, lead
poisoning can cause death.
</P>
<P>
   In April, OSHA proposed additional fines of $456,000 when
Damalos &AMP; Sons was cited for knowingly exposing workers to
potentially fatal falls while they worked on a New Jersey Turnpike
bridge project.
</P>
<P>
   The citations resulted from an investigation into complaints
that the company's 13 employees at the bridge were working 40 feet
over water on suspended platforms without safety harnesses or
lanyards to protect them from falls.
</P>
<P>
   Damalos &AMP; Sons does bridge sandblasting and painting throughout
the eastern United States, OSHA said, and employs about 50 workers.

<HEADLINE> Scouts appeal exclusion from state charity deduction program  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNE YOUMANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY HILL, Conn. (AP) - The Boy Scouts of America on Tuesday
urged the state to continue allowing government workers to
contribute to scouting through payroll deductions.
</P>
<P>
   A state human rights panel ruled that the group's ban on
homosexual troop leaders made it ineligible for the payroll
deduction plan. But the Scouts argued Tuesday that other groups
still in the deduction program limit participation to specific
populations.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments before the Connecticut State Employee Campaign
Committee came a day after the Irving, Texas-based Scouts and one
Connecticut scouting council filed a federal discrimination lawsuit
against the state.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Bridgeport, names
as defendants the employees' campaign committee and state
Comptroller Nancy Wyman.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are hundreds of charities that cater to a specialized
group,'' said attorney Daniel Schwartz, citing organizations for
gays, minorities and the elderly. ''We're not suggesting they're
doing anything wrong. All we're asking is that the Boy Scouts have
the right to do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1910, the Scouts have an oath and law that long have
required members to promise to be ''clean'' and ''morally
straight.'' But no written rule specifically addresses
homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The state Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities
unanimously ruled last month that the Boy Scouts could not be
included in the employee contribution campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, the CHRO declined to rule directly on whether
the Boy Scouts' policy violates state anti-discrimination laws. But
it did find that including a group with such a policy on the
employee contribution list violated state anti-discrimination laws.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign committee had asked the CHRO for a ruling in
November after the New Jersey Supreme Court found the Boy Scouts'
policy was unconstitutional. The Boy Scouts appealed, saying they
had a right to free association under the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey case is now before the U.S. Supreme Court and the
CHRO is awaiting that ruling before issuing one of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz said that until the CHRO or another Connecticut court
rules the Boy Scouts' policy violates state law, excluding the
group from the contribution list would be illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign committee has 20 days to rule. Separately, U.S.
District Court Judge Warren Eginton is expected to conduct a
hearing on the lawsuit Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign committee hires the United Way to collect the
deductions. But the state has the right to prevent the fund-raiser
from giving the Boy Scouts any contributions not designated for a
particular agency.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1999 campaign, $9,950 was contributed directly to the Boy
Scouts by state employees. The Scouts also received a portion of
$200,000 in undesignated contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Pokorny, Scout executive of the Connecticut Rivers Council
in East Hartford - the state's largest Boy Scout council and a
co-plaintiff in the lawsuit - said the amount of money is not the
issue. The concern is that the state's ruling could open the door
for other groups to withhold money from the Scouts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state ruling does not prevent the United Way from giving the
Scouts money collected outside the state employees' campaign. But
the United Way of New Haven stopped giving funds to the Scouts in
1994 because of the policy.
</P>
<P>
   State Comptroller Nancy Wyman said the lawsuit was expected.
Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who represents state
employees, said he was seeking a temporary resolution while the
Supreme Court case is pending. One solution might be to place the
scouting money in a separate account until the high court rules.

<HEADLINE> Peacekeepers in Sierra Leone Clash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- U.N. peacekeepers clashed with
Sierra Leone's feared rebels near a strategic bridge in the West
African country, U.N. officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 rebel fighters made three attempts Monday night to
cross Rokel bridge, 45 miles east of the capital, Freetown, U.N.
spokeswoman Hirut Befecadu said. They were repelled each time by a
Jordanian U.N. battalion stationed at the bridge, which is on the
road leading toward rebel-controlled eastern Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels were believed to have suffered casualties, but no
U.N. troops were hurt or killed.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, pro-government forces said they repelled a rebel
attack Monday at the key front-line town of Lunsar, 45 miles east
of Freetown. Two pro-government soldiers were killed and four rebel
fighters captured, an army statement said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lunsar was retaken by government forces twice last week, nearly
a month after the rebels first captured it.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolutionary United Front rebels killed tens of thousands
of civilians and systematically maimed many more during Sierra
Leone's eight-year civil war. They signed a peace accord with the
government last summer but reignited the conflict in early May,
seizing about 500 U.N. hostages and advancing toward the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages have since been released, and a ragtag coalition of
pro-government forces has been pushing the RUF away from Freetown.
But more than 200 U.N. personnel remain surrounded in the eastern
rebel stronghold of Kailahun, and a new group of about 21
peacekeepers has been detained in nearby Pendembu.
</P>
<P>
   An Indian doctor who visited the 21 peacekeepers Monday reported
that all were in good health and that supplies were reaching them
regularly, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the U.N. Children's Fund reported Tuesday that a
pro-government militia handed over a group of 138 children -- 92
young combatants and 46 children separated from families during
recent fighting -- to UNICEF and the Catholic charity Caritas
Makeni.
</P>
<P>
   The 92 child combatants had fought on the side of the Civil
Defense Force, a pro-government militia. UNICEF said Monday's
handover was the first since President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah urged
that all children under the age of 18 be demobilized.
</P>
<P>
   The youngsters will be cared for in a UNICEF-sponsored Interim
Care Center until their families can be traced and reunifications
arranged.

the Shock (2-4), who shot just 23-of-74 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Sam, a starter last year in all 32 games for the Orlando
Miracle, made her first start this season and provided immediate
offense. She opened the scoring with a 3-pointer and had another
jumper as the Sol opened with a 9-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Sam went down hard with 11:55 left in second half, but remained
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   After leading 32-29 at halftime, Miami increased its lead to
55-45 with 8:00 to play. Miami led 62-46 when Milena Flores hit the
second of two free throws with 4:47 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Miami was 26-of-38 from the free-throw line, while Detroit was
just 13-of-21.
</P>
<P>
   After playing four of its first five at home, Detroit is in a
stretch where it will play 10 of 12 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, the Sol added forward Kristen Rasmussen to the
roster and waived forward Tanja Kostic. Rasmussen, a 6-foot-2
rookie out of Michigan State who averaged 12.7 points and 8.2
rebounds a game in four years, was waived by the Utah Starzz on
June 8.

<HEADLINE> Tigers 16, Blue Jays 3  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY ATKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Bobby Higginson highlighted a rare Detroit power
surge with a pair of three-run homers and seven RBIs as the Tigers
bombed the Toronto Blue Jays 16-3 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez and Brad Ausmus also homered for the Tigers, whose
59 homers rank them next to last in the AL. Higginson was 4-for-4
before being replaced in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Batista had a two-run homer, his 15th, for Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Blair (3-1), whose longest outing this season had been 4
2-3 innings in relief, gave up three runs and six hits over seven
innings in his second start for the win. Blair, who pitched one
perfect inning of relief against St. Louis on Sunday, walked one
and struck out two.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton Andrews (1-2), who notched his first major league win at
Detroit on May 28 with four innings of relief in a 12-7 Toronto
triumph, wasn't nearly so effective in his second career start.
Andrews, who lasted just 1 1-3 innings, yielded six runs on eight
hits.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers ripped Andrews for five runs in the first, four
before he had retired a batter.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews hurt his own cause by walking leadoff batter Damion
Easley, and soon paid for the mistake. Ausmus singled and Higginson
followed with his eighth homer, giving Detroit a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   On the next pitch, Gonzalez made it 4-0 with his 10th homer, a
powerful shot to right-center that hit beneath Hal Newhouser's name
on the tan brick wall behind the fans and caromed back onto the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Palmer followed with a long double to left-center and
scored the inning's fifth run on Shane Halter's one-out RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Ausmus hit a one-out homer in the second, his fourth, and when
Higginson followed with a single, Darwin Cubillan relieved Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   Easley had a two-run double and Higginson another three-run
homer, this time off Cubillan, as the Tigers made it 11-0 in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Gonzalez hit an RBI double in the Toronto fifth.
</P>
<P>
   But the Tigers made it 15-1 with four more runs in the fifth,
including an RBI single by Higginson who received a standing
ovation from the crowd announced at 23,314 when he was lifted for
Rich Becker after reaching first.
</P>
<P>
   Batista's homer made it 15-3 in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Detroit CF Juan Encarnacion made a belly-first sliding
catch to rob Shannon Stewart of a hit leading off the game. ... The
game was held up just briefly with one out in the first while
Toronto C Alberto Castillo caught up with and snagged a baby bird
that was wandering between the plate and the mound. The bird was
later taken to the Huron Valley Bird Rescue Center. ... Josh Phelps
made his major league debut, taking over at catcher in the sixth
for Toronto.

<HEADLINE> Officials urge improvements to fatal U.S. border crossing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PLATTSBURGH, N.Y. (AP) - After two fatalities in six months, New
York officials are calling for major improvements to the border
crossing with Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Plattsburgh-North Country Chamber of Commerce President Garry
Douglas and a chamber delegation was in Washington, D.C., Tuesday
to push a $23 million plan for full refurbishment of the Champlain
border crossing.
</P>
<P>
   The officials delivered a letter to the Canadian Embassy to
express their condolences for the second death of a Canadian
attributed to the backed-up truck traffic at the northern New York
border. They apologized for what they called the American failure
to provide the resources and attention needed to keep the border
safe as traffic increases.
</P>
<P>
   The facility was built in 1967 and uses the technology of 1975,
according to a new video Douglas unveiled Monday. It will help the
delegation present its message.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber-led ''Port of Excellence'' campaign, just six months
old, has already succeeded in obtaining about $2 million in federal
money to make interim fixes at the border.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thats a remarkable indication of the impact were having,''
Douglas said. ''But we arent going to settle for the quick fix.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Customs Agent Thomas Keefe, on hand to represent Customs
employees, said the border bottleneck is hurting the employees'
ability to look for narcotics and other illegal items.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they process one truck every minute, he said.

<HEADLINE> Mystics 57, Liberty 56  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Chamique Holdsclaw scored 23 points and hit the
game-winning jumper with 10.8 seconds left as the Washington
Mystics defeated the New York Liberty 57-56 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw drove past Sue Wicks and Teresa Weatherspoon before
hitting a 10-foot jumper.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Hammon missed a baseline jumper with 3.5 seconds left, and
Tari Phillips missed another attempt at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Nikki McCray added nine points for the Mystics (4-2), who beat
the Liberty (3-5) for the fifth time in six meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Vickie Johnson and Weatherspoon scored 14 points each and Hammon
had 13 for New York. Johnson's driving layup gave New York a 56-55
lead with 39 seconds left before Holdsclaw hit the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 55-51 with 1:28 remaining, the Liberty stole the
inbound pass and Hammon hit a 3-pointer. Weatherspoon then
deflected a pass intended for Vicky Bullett off her fingers and the
Liberty got possession with 50 seconds remaining to set up
Johnson's layup.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, playing with a hairline fracture of her right big toe,
had 10 points and 12 rebounds for New York.
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw, recovering from two stress fractures in her right
foot, finished 10-for-21 from the field and grabbed 12 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Leading by three at halftime, New York opened its biggest lead,
37-28, after Wicks blocked Holdsclaw's shot and Johnson converted a
fastbreak layup. Holdsclaw then scored six straight points and Nagy
made a 3-pointer to it.
</P>
<P>
   After a steal by Bullett, Nagy fed an alley-oop pass to
Holdsclaw that she banked off the glass for a 45-43 lead with 9:40
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Crystal Robinson, in her second game back after
missing four with a sprained left ankle, shot 0-for-7 from the
field. Robinson scored 19 points on 8-for-12 shooting in Saturday's
victory against Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw scored six of her 10 first-half points on consecutive
baskets to give the Mystics an early 18-16 lead. Hammon scored 10
points in the final seven minutes of the opening period, including
a 3-pointer for a 23-20 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Tausha Mills, the No. 2 pick for the Mystics in the draft, made
two straight layups before Johnson's 18-foot jumper gave the
Liberty a 29-26 lead at halftime.

<HEADLINE> House Nears Vote on Education Bill  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans batted down Democratic efforts to
add funds for schools and biomedical research to a $339.5 billion
measure financing next year's education, health and labor programs
as the House moved Tuesday to the brink of a final vote on the
year's biggest spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   With a promised veto by President Clinton waiting in the wings,
Republicans were hoping for House passage on Wednesday of a bill so
controversial that it hasn't come to that chamber's floor since
1997. The measure would boost spending for education and many other
programs over this year's levels but has prompted an election-year
fight by proposing to cut Clinton's plans for hiring teachers and
job training for adults and teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   In a bipartisan compromise, Democrats were allowed to offer and
debate several amendments aimed at restoring some of the money,
funds they would get by trimming the GOP's proposed tax cuts. But
the House parliamentarian -- controlled by Republicans -- ruled the
amendments out of order for procedural reasons and votes on them
were not taken, sparing politically difficult votes for moderate
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Democratic leaders were eager for the vote on final
passage, which they believed could hurt some Republicans in this
fall's elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''For three years the public hasn't had an opportunity to figure
out who's where'' on this bill, said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis. ''And
we're determined to let them find out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee's subcommittee that wrote the bill, said Democrats were
trying to make ''a political point'' with their amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats want ''to get people to believe the majority party
isn't supportive of special education or funding for biomedical
research'' or Pell grants, he said, adding, ''We have been the
champions in each of those areas. You have been the followers.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic amendments included proposals to add $1.7 billion for
the National Institutes of Health, $1 billion for hiring and
training teachers, $1.3 billion for school construction and $1.5
billion for special education.
</P>
<P>
   Though Republicans were against adding money to the bill,
lawmakers of both parties did not want to cut it, either. In a
measure of the measure's popularity, they voted 236-186 against
cutting every program by 0.62 percent -- a total $500 million
reduction -- to fit the measure into the budget.
</P>
<P>
   With their slim 11-seat House majority, GOP leaders spent much
of the day trying to nail down enough votes to ensure passage. Amid
absences by some Republicans and likely defections by others, party
leaders postponed a vote on final passage until at least Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders were most worried about moderate Republicans,
whose districts tend to favor spending for social programs. But one
moderate GOP lawmaker said he would probably vote ''yes'' because
with the Senate version of the bill $4 billion higher, he believed
the final bill would have more money in it.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's been the pattern year after year,'' said Rep. Sherwood
Boehlert, R-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also voted 313-109 for an amendment by Rep. Bernard
Sanders, I-Vt., aimed at requiring pharmaceutical companies to
charge reasonable prices for drugs they developed with the help of
federally financed basic research.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the House bill would spend about $24 billion more than
last year but nearly $9 billion below Clinton's request.
</P>
<P>
   It would provide $39.6 billion for the Education Department,
$1.6 billion above this year but $2.9 billion below Clinton's
proposal. It would ignore Clinton's request for $1.75 billion for
helping communities hire teachers, but set aside the same amount
for teacher hiring and training -- if a separate bill setting up
that program becomes law.
</P>
<P>
   It would also eliminate Clinton's $1.3 billion proposal for
repairing schools and add $1.7 billion to Clinton's $18.8 billion
request for biomedical research at the National Institutes of
Health. The Democratic amendment would have increased the amount of
money for the NIH in the bill by another $1.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also trim Clinton's proposals for student mentoring,
Head Start, child care grants to states, substance abuse treatment
and prevention and several job training programs.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would also bar the government from issuing
regulations later this year aimed at preventing workplace injuries.

<HEADLINE> Party Says It'll Quit Israel Gov't  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak's key coalition
partner, the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, announced Tuesday it would
quit his government, throwing Israel once again into political
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   If Barak's 11-month-old government falls, it would paralyze
Middle East peacemaking for months. But similar crises with Shas,
which represents Israelis of Middle Eastern origin, have been
resolved before.
</P>
<P>
   Shas spiritual leaders, furious over Barak's refusal to hand
over additional millions of tax dollars for their bankrupt school
system, instructed the party's ministers to hand in their
resignations at the next Cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said he would use that time to persuade Shas to stay and
save the broad based government he believes is essential to
pursuing his peace policies.
</P>
<P>
   ''The door is still open, if only a crack,'' he told Channel Two
television. ''I am leading a divided people, and I prefer brotherly
love to unfettered hate.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a message relayed by his office said Barak reserved the
right to fire the renegade ministers whenever he chooses.
</P>
<P>
   If the Shas ministers quit -- or if he fires them before Sunday,
which is also an option -- he would have to decide between calling
new elections or trying to patch together a new coalition team. His
coalition options would be to make up with Shas, to approach the
right-wing Likud opposition, or to form an even shakier minority
government.
</P>
<P>
   If Barak opts for elections or is forced into them,
Israel-Palestinian peace talks would fall off the agenda during a
campaign that might last five months or more. The two sides are
aiming to complete a peace treaty in September.
</P>
<P>
   Barak took office in July 1999 and his coalition problems
started almost immediately, with Shas threatening resignation as
early as December.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's parliament, like its people, is split along several
lines: over terms for peace with the Palestinians and Syria, over
the role of religion in daily life, and over economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's One Israel party has only 26 seats in the 120-seat
parliament. Shas has 17, meaning it holds the balance of power
between hawkish and dovish factions and can hold Barak hostage to
its demands.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, Barak has solved similar Shas threats by pacifying
the party through last-minute talks. A spokesman for the Shas
rabbis said the door is still open for negotiations with Barak.
However, Shas chairman Eli Ishai gave a different message, saying
''the decision is final.''
</P>
<P>
   An attempt by Barak to rule with a narrow coalition would prove
unsuccessful, said Labor Party lawmaker Eli Goldschmidt.
</P>
<P>
   ''My prediction is that we shall have a narrow coalition but
only for six months or 12 months, and then we will have to go to
elections,'' Goldschmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, Shas set up its own school system, emphasizing
religious instruction and offering long school days and free
lunches, an attractive enticement to the Shas target constituency,
made up largely of Israelis low down on the socio-economic scale.
</P>
<P>
   The school system is plagued by huge deficits and mismanagement.
The system's director was suspended under a cloud of fiscal
impropriety.
</P>
<P>
   Shas charges that its pupils receive less state money than
others. But Education Minister Yossi Sarid, Shas' nemesis, refuses
to sign over any more money unless it is accompanied by stricter
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Sarid is the leader of the secular Meretz party, an ideological
rival of Shas. The Shas spiritual leader, Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef, has
compared Sarid to the biblical villains Haman and Amalek, both of
whom tried to destroy the Jewish people, and Yosef is now being
investigated for possible incitement.
</P>
<P>
   Israel cannot be governed like this, says Meretz lawmaker Naomi
Hazan, a professor of political science.
</P>
<P>
   ''The time has come to realize that we made an experiment and it
failed,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Number of Refugees Grows Worldwide  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Conflicts in Kosovo and East Timor and
wars across Africa sent 7 million people fleeing their homes last
year, bringing to 35 million the number of people worldwide who are
uprooted and in need of protection, a leading refugee organization
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Committee for Refugees said more people were living in
refugee camps and makeshift housing at the end of this decade than
at the start. In 1990, 29 million people were either refugees --
defined as people forced to flee their countries -- or internally
displaced residents who leave their homes but not their countries
to escape fighting or political instability.
</P>
<P>
   ''The end of the 20th century has not brought an end to the
bloodshed and persecution that force people to run for their
lives,'' said Bill Frelick, policy director for the
Washington-based non-governmental organization.
</P>
<P>
   The group's World Refugee Survey 2000 found that more and more
often, people aren't crossing borders to escape. Instead, they are
staying in their own countries, albeit outside their homes and
communities. Such ''internal refugees'' accounted for 4 million of
the newly uprooted in 1999, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   That trend has prompted calls -- most vocally from U.S.
Ambassador Richard Holbrooke -- for the U.N. refugee agency to make
caring for internally displaced people more of a priority. Such
people are not afforded the same protections and care as refugees
under the Geneva Conventions.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Committee for Refugees report found that the bulk of
the world's uprooted are in Africa -- an estimated 13.7 million.
Sudan alone accounts for one of every nine of the world's uprooted
people, with 4.4 million out of their homes, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   The group compiles its figures based on a host of information,
including government statistics, non-governmental reports, U.N.
statistics and its own field evaluations.

<HEADLINE> Orioles 3, Rangers 2  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- B.J. Surhoff and Charles Johnson homered, and
Scott Erickson overcame eight walks as Baltimore beat Texas 3-2
Tuesday night, extending the Rangers' losing streak to a
season-high six games.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson's eight walks matched a career high, and he also
allowed five hits in seven innings. But Texas went 1-for-9 with
runners in scoring position and hit into three double plays, all
started by shortstop Mike Bordick.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson (3-3) threw 114 pitches, 59 of them outside the strike
zone.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Groom and Mike Trombley worked the eighth, and Mike Timlin
got three outs for his sixth save in eight opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Helling (7-5) lost his fourth straight start for last-place
Texas. The right-hander struck out six and had an otherwise
effective performance ruined by a pair of 3-1 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Surhoff homered on a 3-1 pitch to cut Texas' lead to 2-1 in the
fourth, and Johnson hit a two-run shot on the same count in the
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third straight victory for the Orioles, their longest
winning streak since a four-game run from May 23-26.
</P>
<P>
   Texas last lost six straight in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers took advantage of Erickson's wildness to go up 2-0
in the third. Erickson walked the bases loaded before David Segui
drove in a run with a grounder, and Dave Martinez hit an RBI
single.
</P>
<P>
   Surhoff hit his 10th homer with two outs in the fourth.
Johnson's 12th home run came after a single by Will Clark.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Albert Belle, 0-for-3 with an intentional walk, had his
13-game hitting streak end. ... Erickson last walked eight in 1990
with the Minnesota Twins. ... Texas has lost four straight and
eight of 10 on the road. ... Baltimore reacquired reliever Alan
Mills from the Los Angeles Dodgers for RHP Al Reyes. It's the first
trade between the teams involving major leaguers since 1989, when
the Orioles got OF Mike Devereaux for RHP Mike Morgan. ... Texas'

<HEADLINE> Pirates 7, Braves 6, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Wil Cordero led off the bottom of the 10th
inning with his 10th homer as the Pittsburgh Pirates rallied from a
three-run ninth-inning deficit for a 7-6 victory over the Atlanta
Braves on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Cordero hit a 3-2 pitch from Don Wengert (0-1) into the
left-field seats as Pittsburgh got its 16th come-from-behind win
among 28 victories this season.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Silva (5-2) pitched a one-hit 10th for the win as the
Pirates beat the Braves for the first time in five tries this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh tied the score 6-6 with three runs in the ninth
against Mike Remlinger, who had been perfect in six save
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Young led off with a double and John Vander Wal walked.
Young moved to third on Luis Sojo's grounder and scored when Bruce
Aven beat out a possible double-play ball.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Mike Benjamin doubled off the right-field wall,
missing a home run by a foot. Warren Morris lined a single to
center on an 0-2 pitch, and Benjamin scored the tying run just
ahead of Andruw Jones' throw.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones hit his third homer in two days, and Brian Jordan
added a two-run shot for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves roughed up 23-year-old Bronson Arroyo in his major
league pitching debut, getting 10 hits and five runs off him in
five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta starter John Burkett allowed three runs and six hits in
six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Young had three RBIs, giving him nine in two games against the
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Arroyo opened the game by giving up consecutive singles to
Quilvio Veras, Jones and Chipper Jones to account for one run. He
got a break when Andruw Jones was thrown out at third base.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were trailing 2-1 in the third when Jordan hit his
12th homer, one out after Chipper Jones' single. Javy Lopez and
Bobby Bonilla hit consecutive doubles to give Atlanta a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones had an RBI groundout in the fourth, and Andruw
Jones hit a solo homer, his 17th of the season, against reliever
Josias Manzanillo in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Morris and Jason Kendall singled, and Brian Giles walked to load
the bases in the first, and Young followed with a two-run single.
Young added an RBI groundout after Cordero's leadoff double in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
Notes@: Burkett, a 10-year veteran from nearby Beaver, Pa., still
draws family and friends. He left 69 tickets. ... Chipper Jones
started at shortstop as Rafael Furcal went on the disabled list,
and Walt Weiss has a thumb injury. ... Arroyo was the third member
of the Pirates' 1995 draft class to reach the majors. Outfielder
Chad Hermansen was demoted to the minors earlier this year, and
pitcher Brian O'Connor came up from Double-A Altoona for one start.
... Arroyo was the 20th pitcher the Pirates have used this year,
including backup catcher Keith Osik, who mopped up in a game.
Pittsburgh used 19 pitchers last season.

<HEADLINE> Gore Kicks Off Campaign Tour  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Asking Americans, ''Are you better off than you
were eight years ago?'' Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore
claimed credit for the nation's roaring economy Tuesday and
proposed tax credits and trust funds to ensure better times still.
</P>
<P>
   ''America has done well. But I'm here to tell you, you ain't
seen nothing yet,'' the vice president told a foot-stomping,
hand-clapping crowd of supporters in a tiny auditorium at the New
York Historical Society.
</P>
<P>
   The address opened a three-week ''progress and prosperity tour''
designed to improve the vice president's standing against
presumptive Republican nominee George W. Bush. A poll this week
showed voters slightly favoring Bush as the man they trust to
protect the economy, a worrisome sign for Democrats who have long
assumed the issue would be their strongest suit.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of this boom happened by accident,'' Gore said, giving
credit to the Clinton administration and the American work ethic.
The vice president, who has gone to great lengths at times to
distance himself from President Clinton, declared, ''I intend to
build even higher on the foundation of the Clinton years.''
</P>
<P>
   With the government expected this month to increase its estimate
of budget surpluses, a new campaign issue is taking shape: how to
divide the spoils of a booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore argues that Bush's tax-cut plans would endanger Social
Security and education, health care and environmental programs.
Bush, the two-term Texas governor who has held a slight edge over
Gore in state and national polls, says tax cuts are fiscally sound
and a moral imperative when surpluses abound.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won't spend money that we don't yet have on a huge tax cut
our economy can't afford, in ways that could end our prosperity and
progress,'' Gore said in his address. He referred to Bush once, and
then only as ''the opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett said, ''There was a lot of talk
about trust and trust funds, but the only thing Al Gore trusts is
the government. Apparently, Al Gore doesn't trust individual
Americans to make their own choices about retirement, health care
needs, education and finances.''
</P>
<P>
   Promising details as the tour continues, Gore said he will
support targeted tax cuts allowing middle-class Americans to pay
college tuition, buy health insurance and save for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   He reiterated his plan that would dedicate Medicare payroll
taxes to the entitlement program and pay down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   He also proposed tax-free, voluntary retirement accounts that
would be funded out of budget surpluses. Bush wants to use payroll
taxes, now dedicated to Social Security, for a program allowing
Americans to invest in the stock market for their retirement
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a Social Security plus, it is not Social Security
minus,'' Gore said in a slap at Bush's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's initiative sounds similar to a proposal Clinton has put
in his budget the past two years for tax credits to encourage
savings -- a proposal Congress has not accepted.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also said he would set aside unspecified
portions of the surplus to create separate trust funds to be used
only for education, health care and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   History shows that promise would be hard to keep.
</P>
<P>
   There are already more than 100 trust funds in the federal
budget, most of which are routinely tapped by Congress to pay for
programs outside the trust funds' original mandates.
</P>
<P>
   ''From a practical standpoint, (trust funds are) meaningless in
the sense that Congress can do with the money anything it wants,''
said Robert Reischauer, president of the liberal-leaning Urban
Institute and former director of the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Stanley Collender, who monitors the budget for the
consulting firm Fleishman-Hillard, said the trust funds would ''put
additional pressure on the president and Congress to spend the
money as planned.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides believe the proposals will help crystallize their
basic economic argument: Voters can have a big tax cut or new
domestic spending, but not both.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual late-night event Tuesday after continuing on to
Scranton, Pa., Gore appeared at an airport rally timed to get him
featured on the local TV news. Addressing an enthusiastic crowd of
several hundred, Gore said: ''Are you ready to fight to win this
election?
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of small ''Progress'' and ''Prosperity''
signs posted behind Gore's head and a larger-than-usual press
corps, the ballyhooed battleground state tour didn't look much
different from the standard fare.
</P>
<P>
   The first leg will last just three days before Gore takes the
Father's Day weekend off. He spends almost as much time in New York
-- a Democratic state that isn't yet in contention -- as he does in
the battleground states of Pennsylvania and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Four-day work weeks are scheduled for the rest of the tour.
</P>
<P>
   By organizing a political trip around a single slogan, Gore is
acknowledging Bush's success at pounding home campaign themes.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor has divided the campaign into two-week
segments since wrapping up the GOP nomination, sticking to a single
topic for each period: education, foreign affairs, Social Security
and government reform. The tactic has given voters, most of whom
are paying little attention to the campaign, an easy script to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of the day, Gore stopped Tuesday at a Manhattan
construction site between campaign events. ''Keep up the good work,
guys,'' he shouted to a group of union workers.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Drago, a 62-year-old foreman, said these are prosperous
times for the union and its workers. But who gets the credit?
</P>
<P>
   His answer summed up Gore's problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''I give it to Clinton,'' Drago said.

<HEADLINE> Bowman Unsure on Red Wings Return  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Scotty Bowman shows no signs of slowing down, yet
he still hasn't made a decision as to whether he'll return as the
Detroit Red Wings coach.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman will be busy this summer, volunteering at the U.S. Open
golf tournament, helping NHL coaches form an association, watching
Wimbledon and attending the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   At some point he'll let the Red Wings know his plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know he's getting closer to making his decision,'' general
manager Ken Holland told The Oakland Press of Pontiac on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Holland and Bowman have spoken regularly by phone but do not
have plans to meet.
</P>
<P>
   The coach, who turns 67 in September, has been waiting for a
final consultation with his doctor after a full physical last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the biggest issue is to make sure I'm on the right
page on the medical exam,'' Bowman said.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman is leaving Wednesday for the U.S. Open, where he'll help
provide player updates to a centralized scoring system.
</P>
<P>
   The Wings expect to find out after the tournament whether Bowman
will return for his eighth season with the Red Wings and a record
29th NHL season.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not urgent, but I'd like to know within the next week,''
Holland said.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman would also like to meet with Holland within a week to
discuss the Red Wings' standing offer.
</P>
<P>
   He has been the subject of retirement speculation since having
knee-replacement surgery and an angioplasty that caused him to miss
the early part of the 1998-99 season. Bowman said he will not
return unless he gets a clean bill of health.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, the Wings would like to know his plans before the June
24-25 entry draft. If Bowman decides to step aside, Holland can
begin scouting for potential replacements at the selection in
Calgary
</P>
<P>
   Already a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame, Bowman has coached
eight teams to Stanley Cup titles, and is the winningest coach in
NHL regular-season (1,144) and playoff (205) history.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman is one of only two coaches in the four major sports to
win a championship with three different teams (Montreal,
Pittsburgh, Detroit).

<HEADLINE> Democratic Convention Draws Near  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE DeARMOND
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Democratic Party officials continue to cast
plans for their upcoming national convention in a positive light,
despite a fund-raising shortfall and labor dispute that could lead
to a strike by workers who keep the meeting site functioning.
</P>
<P>
   The local host committee must collect $35.3 million in cash and
in-kind contributions before the Aug. 14-17 convention at the
Staples Center here. The Democratic National Convention Committee
needs $18 million of that in cash, but the host committee has only
taken in about $11.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers played down concerns about the fund-raising Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be honest, I think the fund-raising thing has a been a
little overblown. ...All of the money that we've needed so far has
been there,'' said Rod O'Connor, chief operating officer of the
Democratic National Convention Committee. ''The money is going to
get done.''
</P>
<P>
   The host committee has raised $31.7 million, but more than $20
million has been in-kind contributions, meaning it must exceed its
original goal to come up with the needed cash.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the two committees expressed optimism that the
recent hiring of veteran Democratic fund-raiser Terry McAuliffe as
chairman of the national committee will help organizers reach the
fund-raising goal. McAuliffe was to arrive in Los Angeles on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials led about 350 media representatives on
tours of the convention site on Monday and Tuesday and did not
mention the problems that threaten to mar the event.
</P>
<P>
   Separately on Wednesday, workers with the Operating Engineers
Union are to vote on a contract described as their employer's
''last, best and final offer'' in negotiations that have lasted for
months. The engineers are responsible for heating, cooling and
lighting at the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   It is the only union with workers at the arena that has not
reached a contract, and thus has not signed a labor
union-Democratic National Committee peace agreement ensuring no
strikes by convention workers. Union officials declined to comment
on what would happen if the workers rejected the contract, but a
strike is considered a possibility.

<HEADLINE> IU Professor Takes Leave of Absence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- An Indiana University professor who is
one of basketball coach Bob Knight's most outspoken critics says
harassment and threats have forced him to take an unpaid leave of
absence.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to be here in the fall. It's going to cost me
financially, but I'm so exhausted, I want to get out of town,''
English professor Murray Sperber told SportsLine.com on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He said he opted for unpaid leave so he would not have to stay
in Bloomington. He would not say when he plans to return.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated attempts by The Associated Press to contact Sperber at
home Tuesday were unsuccessful. A university spokesman did not
return a phone message left at his home seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomington police Sgt. Scott Oldham said police are
investigating reports that Sperber received threats against his
life in retaliation for his comments to the media.
</P>
<P>
   The university recently suspended Knight for three games in the
2000-01 season and fined him $30,000 following an investigation
into accusations he choked a player in 1997. He also faces a
''zero-tolerance policy'' that will lead to his immediate firing if
he crosses the line again.
</P>
<P>
   Sperber, 59, an author of three books on college sports, has
criticized the university for being too lenient on Knight through
nearly three decades of the coach's controversial behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to continue and continue,'' Sperber said recently.
''This is a horrible hit for the image of the university.''

shooting seven co-workers in the state's worst mass murder. Jurors rejected the
insanity defense for Byran Uyesugi. He faces up to life in prison. Hawaii does
not have the death penalty. The defense did not dispute that Uyesugi, 40, shot
and killed the seven Xerox Corp. employees on Nov. 2, but he pleaded innocent by
reason of insanity. Prosecutor Peter Carlisle acknowledged that Uyesugi suffers

<HEADLINE> Man Charged in Barrel Deaths  </HEADLINE>
By MELANIE COFFEE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LENEXA, Kan. (AP) -- A man was charged Tuesday with the murders
of five women whose bodies were found in barrels on his property
and in a storage locker, and prosecutors plan to seek the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   John Edward Robinson, 56, already was in jail on $5 million bail
on charges of aggravated sexual battery and theft involving two
women he allegedly met over the Internet for sadomasochistic sex.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's lawyer has said his client is innocent. Through their
lawyer, Robinson's relatives issued a statement Tuesday night
saying their ''ultimate goal is for the truth, no matter what that
may be, to come to light.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have said Robinson trolled the Internet for sex
under the name ''slavemaster'' and may have met victims that way.
Authorities said he may be connected to the deaths or disappearance
of at least nine people.
</P>
<P>
   Five women have been found bludgeoned to death and stuffed in
barrels on Robinson's property in Kansas and in a storage locker he
rented in Missouri. Prosecutors in both states filed murder charges
in those deaths Tuesday; the Missouri charges say the killings were
committed for financial gain.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the victims have been identified -- Beverly Bonner, 49,
Izabela Lewicka, 22, and Suzette Trouten, 28. Bonner was found in
the locker. Trouten and Lewicka's bodies were found on the Kansas
farm.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Bonner might have known Robinson while she worked in
the library at the Western Missouri Correctional Center, where
Robinson served a theft sentence until 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have also discovered links between Robinson and
four people -- three women and an infant -- missing since the
mid-1980s. None of those women has been identified as being among
the victims in the barrels.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Seeks $16M for Campaign  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- House Republican leaders will demand GOP
lawmakers raise $16 million for use in key contested races this
fall, officials said Tuesday night. They intend to hold the rank
and file accountable through control of chairmanships and committee
assignments in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Any Republican who declines to assume responsibility for his
allotted fund-raising quota will be asked to ''call the speaker
(House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.), set up a personal meeting
to tell him why,'' according to material prepared for a session of
GOP members on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The effort, dubbed ''Battleground 2000,'' comes at a time when
Republicans are battling to hold their slender House majority
against an aggressive Democratic effort to gain control. Democrats
have been surprisingly competitive in fund raising over the past 18
months and have far fewer retirements to contend with than
Republicans do.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential contender George W. Bush leads in the
polls, but a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional
Committee, Jim Wilkinson, said Tuesday night, ''We think Bush could
win and we'd still lose the House if we don't get the fundamentals
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., who chairs the House campaign committee,
said Republicans will rely on the money to ''tailor individual
campaigns in races where we think control will be decided.''
Republicans, he vowed, ''will not be out-hustled or
out-organized.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson said Davis and Hastert had each pledged to donate or
raise $700,000 toward the $16 million goal. Former members will be
solicited, as well, he said, and one wealthy Republican contender
for an open seat in California, Darrell Issa, planned to attend
Wednesday's meeting to stress his support.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson said the money will be used to boost voter turnout,
operate phone banks, send out direct mail and run television
commercials tailored to the individual circumstances in a district.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to identify the 35 or so contested seats where the
money will be used.
</P>
<P>
   A GOP effort to raise funds from lawmakers in 1998, ''Operation
Breakout,'' is widely viewed in hindsight by many Republicans to be
to be a major strategic blunder. In that case, the high command
decided to air a series of commercials relating to President
Clinton's impeachment in the closing days of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a Democratic gain of seats on Election Day that
led to the retirement of then-Speaker Newt Gingrich.

<HEADLINE> GOP Vie for Congressional Seats  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   A state legislator backed by Virginia's Republican governor won
a very close GOP primary race for an open House seat Tuesday after
a campaign that brought bitter accusations of financial and
personal improprieties.
</P>
<P>
   With all precincts reporting, Eric Cantor, a member of the state
House of Delegates, had 20,902 votes, just over 50 percent, while
state Sen. Steve Martin had 20,637 votes, just under 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Cantor, who had Gov. Jim Gilmore's endorsement, had questioned
Martin's votes on legislative pay and expenses. Martin raised
issues about Cantor's family's dealings in real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on a day of primary and runoff elections in five
states, an open House seat from South Carolina drew six GOP
candidates, while two Arkansas Democrats were in a runoff for a
House seat. Virginia also saw a contentious fight for a second open
House seat.
</P>
<P>
   Cantor will face school superintendent Warren Stewart, whom
Democrats nominated at the last minute on Monday in the race to
fill the seat of GOP Rep. Thomas J. Bliley, who is retiring after
20 years.
</P>
<P>
   In an eastern Virginia House race, Jo Ann Davis, a member of the
House of Delegates, defeated businessman Paul Jost for the GOP
nomination, even though he spent nearly $1 million of his own
money, more than three times the combined total of all four of his
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   With all precincts reporting, Davis had 14,263 votes, or 35
percent, to Jost's 12,155 votes, or 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   She will face former Fredericksburg mayor Lawrence Davies, a
Democrat, in the November race to replace retiring GOP Rep. Herbert
H. Bateman.
</P>
<P>
   Jost, who also had the governor's endorsement, was attacked by
other candidates who said he supported abortion and gay rights, and
critics mailed out fliers with a photo of two men kissing, labeled
''Paul Jost's Vision of Virginia.'' Jost said he is opposed to
abortion except in cases of rape, incest or when the woman's life
is in danger. On gay rights, his campaign said Jost opposes all
forms of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest seats up for election Tuesday went unchallenged. No
primary opponents emerged for two-term Democratic Sen. Charles Robb
of Virginia, freshman GOP Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine and
Democratic Sen. Kent Conrad of North Dakota, seeking a third full
term. Even North Dakota's seat for governor, open because
Republican Ed Schafer chose not to seek a third term, went without
a primary fight.
</P>
<P>
   A crowded South Carolina race went to a runoff, with state Rep.
Henry Brown taking 44 percent of the vote. His nearest opponent,
former state transportation chairman H.B. ''Buck'' Limehouse, got
33 percent, after Limehouse outspent Brown by nearly 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   The seat, in a coastal district, is held by GOP Rep. Mark
Sanford, who is sticking to a campaign pledge to serve just three
terms. Democrat Andy Brack, a former reporter and spokesman for
Democratic Sen. Ernest Hollings, is unopposed in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   And in a South Carolina primary that will essentially determine
the general election winner, first-term GOP Rep. James DeMint
easily defeated Frank Raddish. Democrats did not run a candidate in
the heavily GOP district.
</P>
<P>
   In early North Dakota returns, most voters were voting to keep
the state treasurer's post, a proposal that drew criticism from
state treasurers around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   And early returns from six western counties showed a mixed
response to a proposal to set their clocks ahead to Central time
and join the eastern part of the state. Whatever the vote, county
and state officials must agree on any change. Several other
counties aren't considering a move from Mountain time.
</P>
<P>
   In a runoff for the Democratic nomination for an Arkansas House
seat, state Sen. Mike Ross defeated former TV reporter Dewayne
Graham 58 percent to 42 percent. Ross will face GOP Rep. Jay Dickey
in the fall.

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Pentagon Spending Bill  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate approved a $287.4 billion defense
spending bill Tuesday night after rejecting an effort to eliminate
funds for more executive jets for admirals and generals.
</P>
<P>
   The bill pays for Defense Department programs in the fiscal year
that begins Oct. 1. It now must be reconciled with a House-passed
version that is about $1 billion more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   On a 65-32 vote, the Senate rejected an amendment by Sens. Tom
Harkin, D-Iowa, and Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., that would have
stopped the Pentagon from leasing more executive jets for its top
brass.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon already leases six executive jets and wants $48.6
million for six more, Harkin said. ''There is no justification for
additional luxury jets to ferry generals and admirals around from
meeting to meeting,'' said Harkin.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens,
R-Alaska, said the leasing program was an attempt to save taxpayers
money ''to lease aircraft instead of replacing them,'' as do ''most
major businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The final Pentagon spending bill was then passed, 95-3. Voting
no were Sens. Boxer, Russ Feingold, D-Wisc., and Paul Wellstone,
D-Minn. Not voting were Sens. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Jay
Rockefeller, D-W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also voted 84-14 to restrict the Pentagon's use of
powerful pesticides on installations where there are children as
the chamber moved toward approval of a $287.4 billion Defense
Department spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer, the amendment's author, said current rules on permissible
levels of toxins ''were set to protect essentially 155-pound men.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents suggested the measure would single out military bases
for more stringent requirements than are in place at other federal
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said that the measure would put into law what is already
Pentagon policy -- and that she was trying to impose the same
restrictions throughout the government but that ''so far we have
not had much luck moving that larger package.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure would ban in areas where there may be children, such
as schools and playgrounds, certain pesticides that contain
cancer-containing agents and nerve toxins.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate earlier accepted, by voice vote, a Boxer amendment to
safeguard the privacy of military medical records.
</P>
<P>
   Ruled out of order -- because it did not involve defense spending
directly -- was an amendment by Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., that would
ease rules governing high-speed computer exports.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill is a $3 billion increase over the Clinton
administration request, although about $1 billion less than the
version passed last week by the House.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on a related issue, Rep. Sonny Callahan, D-Ala.,
chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on foreign
operations, suggested he may seek to withhold aid to Israel -- or at
least delay it -- to protest Israel's decision to sell advance radar
to China.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Monday urged Congress
against any such linkage.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is building a plane for China and equipping it with the
U.S.-developed PHALCON airborne early warning radar system at a
cost of $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan has suggested that $2.8 billion in aid to Israel be cut
by that $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   However, on Tuesday he said that he would propose instead to
hold up the early disbursement of Israel's aid money -- Israel
traditionally gets the money up front, in the first two weeks of
each new fiscal year -- for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   He said that would ''give the administration time to negotiate
what we hope will be an acceptable result.''
</P>
<P>
   But, if no such agreement was reached by time a final version of
the foreign aid bill is hammered out by a House-Senate conference
committee this summer, ''the hammer is still there and could
fall,'' Callahan said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He gave the administration a possible way out, saying that if
Secretary of Defense William Cohen ''wants to issue a statement
saying it's not a threat to our national security, then the issue
is over with.''
</P>
<P>
   The new fiscal year begins Oct. 1.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 5, Yankees 3  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Jason Varitek homered into the upper deck off
Orlando Hernandez and the Boston bullpen shut down the New York
Yankees on one hit for 6 2-3 innings, giving the Red Sox a 5-3
victory Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett contributed a triple, double and single as the Red
Sox moved into a virtual first-place tie with the Yankees in the AL
East.
</P>
<P>
   A calm crowd of 52,142 came to life with two outs in the sixth
inning when Hernandez got two strikes on Varitek. But after taking
a close, 2-2 breaking ball, Varitek teed off for a two-run homer
deep into the upper deck in right field for a 5-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, most of the buzz at Yankee Stadium was about
Sammy Sosa. Both the Yankees and Red Sox are interested in trading
for the Chicago slugger, and the Cubs had a scout in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   A sellout is expected Wednesday afternoon when Pedro Martinez
faces Roger Clemens in a rematch of their classic duel May 28.
Martinez won 2-0 that night, pitching a four-hitter to best
Clemens' 13 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez (6-5) was the MVP of the AL championship series last
October with two sharp starts against the Red Sox. This time, they
tagged him for nine hits in 6 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Boston starter Brian Rose lasted only 2 1-3 innings, and left
with the bases loaded and the score tied at 3.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Hipolito Pichardo got Shane Spencer to ground into an
inning-ending double play, and the Yankees never got a runner past
second base the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Pichardo (1-0) pitched 2 2-3 hitless innings for his first major
league win since Aug. 20, 1998 with Kansas City against Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Garces worked two scoreless innings, Rheal Cormier pitched
a perfect eighth and Derek Lowe closed for his 15th save.
</P>
<P>
   Wilton Veras hit an RBI single in the Boston second and
Everett's RBI triple highlighted a two-run third.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter and Bernie Williams doubled in the Yankees first.
Rose made an error, dropping a double-play relay that let New York
score twice in the third.
</P>
<P>
Notes: With a threat of rain, the tarp was on the field before the
game and there was no batting practice. The teams were washed out
Monday night. ... Yankees 2B Chuck Knoblauch started after missing
five games because of a sore left forearm. He struck out looking in
his first two at-bats, but made several nice plays in the field.
... The last Boston player to hit for the cycle was John Valentin
in 1996.

<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Pinch-runner Damon Buford scored from second on a
throwing error by shortstop Kurt Abbott in the eighth inning,
lifting the Chicago Cubs to a 4-3 victory over the New York Mets on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   With the game tied 3-3 and one out in the eighth, Henry
Rodriguez singled off John Franco (2-2) and was removed for Buford.
Joe Girardi singled, advancing Buford to second, and pinch-hitter
Glenallen Hill hit a grounder to first baseman Todd Zeile. He threw
to Abbott at second for the force, but Abbott's throw to Franco,
covering first, was wide and bounced against the fence near the
Mets dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Heredia (3-1) picked up the win with a perfect eighth,
while Rick Aguilera got three outs for his 13th save in 17
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Back-to-back doubles by Sammy Sosa and Mark Grace with two outs
in the first off Rick Reed gave the Cubs a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets loaded the bases with one out in the second and tied
the game on Jason Tyner's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Payton walked to lead off the fifth and reached third on
Derek Bell's single. Cubs starter Kevin Tapani struck out the next
two batters before Robin Ventura drove in both runners with a
double to make it 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Huson led off the Cubs fifth with a bunt single, advanced
on Tapani's sacrifice and a wild pitch by Reed, and scored on Eric
Young's sacrifice fly to second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo in shallow
center.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs in the seventh, Young singled, stole second and
scored on Brant Brown's single to tie it at 3 and chase Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Tapani gave up three runs on five hits and five walks in seven
innings, striking out six.
</P>
<P>
   Reed gave up three runs on nine hits over 6 2-3 innings,
striking out three.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Reed is 0-3 in six career appearances at Wrigley Field. ...
The Mets will make up Sunday's rainout against the Yankees on July
8 in a unique doubleheader. The two will play a day game at Shea
Stadium as scheduled, and a makeup night game at Yankee Stadium.
It's the first time since Sept. 7, 1903, that two major league
games will be played between the same teams on the same day at
different stadiums. ... Carlton Fisk, who will be inducted into the
Hall of Fame in July, sang ''Take Me Out to the Ballgame'' during
the seventh-inning stretch.

By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Scott Rolen's two-run single broke a tie and
Ron Gant homered and drove in two runs as the Philadelphia Phillies
spoiled Chuck Smith's major league debut with a 4-3 victory over
the Florida Marlins on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Smith left after Florida took a 2-1 lead in the top of the
seventh. But Gant tied it with an RBI single off Joe Strong (0-1)
before Rolen's bases-loaded single against Armando Almanza provided
the final margin.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gomes (3-4) pitched 1 1-3 innings. Jeff Brantley allowed a
pinch-hit home run by Derrek Lee leading off the ninth before
closing for his sixth save in as many chances.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, acquired in a three-way deal from Texas last Friday,
spent nine years in the minors before making his first start. The
30-year-old right-hander allowed one run and six hits in six
innings. He struck out six and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Person allowed one run and five hits in six innings. He
struck out seven and walked two.
</P>
<P>
   Person, who doesn't have a decision in his last three starts, is
5-2 with a 3.25 ERA. He has emerged as the ace on a staff that
includes Curt Schilling and Andy Ashby, who have combined to make
five All Star teams, but are 3-11 this season.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Arias doubled to lead off the seventh against Strong. One
out later, Doug Glanville hit an infield single and moved to second
on a wild pitch. Gant's single tied it at 2, and put runners on the
corners.
</P>
<P>
   Almanza entered the game and walked Bobby Abreu before Rolen
ripped a single past a diving Andy Fox at third base.
</P>
<P>
   Florida took a 2-1 lead in the seventh on Mark Kotsay's RBI
single. Mark Smith led off the inning against reliever Mark
Holzemer with a pinch-hit, ground-rule double that fell between Pat
Burrell and Abreu.
</P>
<P>
   After Luis Castillo's sacrifice, Smith scored on Kotsay's single
to right through a drawn-in infield.
</P>
<P>
   Gant gave the Phillies a 1-0 lead in the first with his 11th
home run -- a blast off the facing of the upper deck in left field.
</P>
<P>
   Florida tied it at 1 in the second on Kevin Millar's eighth
homer.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies nearly took the lead in the second, but Preston
Wilson gunned down Mickey Morandini on a close play at the plate to
end the inning after Arias had singled to center.
</P>
<P>
   Morandini slid headfirst past the plate as his batting gloves --
which had been in his hand -- flew across the plate. But catcher
Paul Bako applied the tag before Morandini could sneak his hand
back in.
</P>
<P>
   Person allowed two hits after the second inning and retired 10
of 11 at one point, including seven straight. He escaped a
bases-loaded, two-out jam in the sixth by striking out Bako.
</P>
<P>
Notes@: Kotsay's double in the first inning gave him hits in five
straight at-bats. He flied out in the third to end the streak. ...
The Phillies have homered in 10 straight games; their longest since
homering in 12 straight July 2-17 of 1997. The club record is 14,
set in 1922. ... Philadelphia is 1-9 on Tuesdays. ... Gant has a
10-game hitting streak. He's hitting .400 in that span (18-for-45).

<HEADLINE> Olympic Sponsor Under Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Environmental campaigners dressed in
mock Coca-Cola cans held a demonstration Wednesday outside the
Australian headquarters of the Olympic sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental watchdog Greenpeace has targeted the American
company in an ongoing campaign against the use of ozone-depleting
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) as refrigerants.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace said Coca-Cola was breaking ''Green Games''
environmental guidelines, including bans on HFCs at Olympic sites,
which formed an integral part of Sydney's bid to serve as host of
the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   In a highly visible protest at Circular Quay, on Sydney Harbor
adjacent to the Sydney Opera House, activists gathered around a
giant Coke can displaying the words ''enjoy climate change.''
</P>
<P>
   Others dressed up as polar bears and waved placards saying:
''Help me now! Coca-Cola stop using HFCs.''
</P>
<P>
   ''As an Olympic sponsor Coca-Cola can't keep ignoring the Games'
environmental guidelines,'' Greenpeace campaigner Rupert Posner
said. ''Coca-Cola is undermining the credibility of the 'Green
Games' by its appalling effort on the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists estimate Coca-Cola will have 1,700
refrigerators using HFCs in Sydney and only 100 coolers that comply
with the ''Green Games'' guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has said the cooling equipment to be used at Olympic
sites was a ''significant advance'' in energy efficiency and that
commercial drink coolers using alternative refrigerants were not
commercially available on a scale required for the Olympics.

<HEADLINE> House Votes on Drug Prices  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Tuesday to require
pharmaceutical companies to charge reasonable prices for products
they develop as a result of federally financed basic research.
</P>
<P>
   Though it is unclear if the provision will ever make it into
law, the 313-109 vote underlined the political potency this
election year of accusing drug companies of charging high prices.
</P>
<P>
   In a mark of the effort's wide-ranging appeal, the measure was
sponsored by Rep. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, a socialist and one
of the most liberal members of Congress, and co-sponsored by Rep.
Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., one of the House's most conservative
members. It received a majority of Democratic and Republican votes.
</P>
<P>
   The provision would require the National Institutes of Health to
obligate companies using institute research to charge prices ''on
reasonable terms'' for any pharmaceuticals they develop, said
Sanders spokesman David Sirota. The institutes, which are federal
agencies, perform biomedical research and give grants to university
and other scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The provision would not apply to such products already on the
market, Sirota said. These include tamoxifen, used for fighting
breast cancer, the anti-AIDS drug AZT, and taxol, another
anti-cancer drug.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is nothing more than asking a fair return for the
taxpayers of this country for their investment'' of billions of
dollars annually in biomedical research, Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies argue that the prices they charge are justified
by the billions they must invest in producing effective new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., opposed the provision, saying the
basic biomedical research performed by the National Institutes of
Health is available to all companies to use. Those that develop
successful products by building on that research are ''simply
adding to a body of knowledge that is available to all companies
everywhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The language was attached to a $339 billion measure financing
health, education and labor programs for the coming fiscal year.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   WATERBURY, Conn. (AP) - Waterbury Mayor Philip Giordano is
making it official, he will run for U.S. Senate against incumbent
Joseph Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Giordano, a Republican, planned to launch his campaign with a
series of stops around Connecticut on Wednesday, including an
appearance with Gov. John G. Rowland in Hartford. Rowland had
earlier advised Giordano not to run against Lieberman, who won his
last election by more than 350,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has been mentioned as a possible running mate for Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 16 women come forward; questions surround police handling  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Two days after a roving mob terrorized at least
16 women - including four tourists - in Central Park, questions
arose Tuesday about how authorities handled the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Two victims said police were slow to respond to their cries.
Ironically, more than 900 officers were assigned to patrol the park
that day because of a parade on adjacent Fifth Avenue. On a normal
Sunday, 36 officers patrol the 840-acre park.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard
Safir brushed off the incidents as ''isolated.'' On Tuesday, their
tone softened.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very concerned about the women who got assaulted, maybe
more than you, because I feel responsible,'' Giuliani told
reporters. ''We regret very much that this has happened. Sometimes
some sick, crazy criminal or drunk kids do sick things.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the ''sick and shocking and horrible'' incidents
will be investigated ''with tremendous enthusiasm and enormous
force.''
</P>
<P>
   The incidents involved men spraying water on women, tearing at
their clothes, groping them and, in some cases, robbing them.
Although perhaps as many as 40 men took part, only two were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   At their bail hearing Tuesday, prosecutors related the ordeal of
an 18-year-old British tourist. She and her friends were surrounded
and soaked with water; men tore at her shirt and ripped off her
shorts; hands violated her private areas. Then the men were gone,
fleeing into crowds of people in the park seeking relief from the
90-degree weather.
</P>
<P>
   The woman quickly found two cops who helped her search for her
attackers. Minutes later, two men were arrested: the wrong men,
defense lawyers claim.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt that they were under a lot of pressure to arrest
somebody,'' said David Kapner, attorney for David Rowe, 24, of
Hempstead, on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting incidents and murders are on the rise in the city, a
contrast to dramatic declines in the 1990s. Relatively little crime
has occurred this year in Central Park, but that was no comfort for
victims of Sunday's rampage.
</P>
<P>
   Peyton Bryant, 29, a kickboxing teacher in Manhattan, was inline
skating near Central Park South and Sixth Avenue when the group of
men set upon her, trying to pull down her pants. Bryant struggled
and the men ran off.
</P>
<P>
   ''I skated over to an officer and told him I was attacked and
that the crowd was out of control,'' Bryant said. ''I told him I
was assaulted, but he acted like it was nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant approached two other officers who told her to file a
report at the Midtown North Precinct. She did, but no one offered
to help her look for her attackers, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman, the mother of one of two Long Island teen-agers
attacked, said police also ignored her daughter's cries. They only
pointed to an ambulance parked nearby, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Police are conducting an internal investigation into the
complaints, and Giuliani said if the allegations are true, the
officers will be ''severely disciplined.'' The mayor offered a
$10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction
of any of the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   All the attacks occurred during a short span of time, around 6
p.m. and in the southern portion of the park, near the zoo and the
Plaza Hotel. Among the victims were a French couple on their
honeymoon, the three British tourists and an Associated Press
reporter and her friend.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said police officers were not nearby when the specific
incidents occurred.
</P>
<P>
   While some victims criticized the police, the French couple
praised them, the husband told the AP in a telephone interview
Tuesday. After the attack, the couple ran to an officer, who put
them in his car. The couple was surrounded by about 100 people, 10
to 20 of whom attacked them, the husband said. Some of the crowd
ran after them, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ''He took us in his car to protect us from the crowd,'' said the
man, who did not want his name or his wife's to be used.
</P>
<P>
   The officer radioed for help, and within minutes, the husband
said between 50 and 60 cops on scooters and in cars arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The officers asked if the couple could identify their attackers,
but the husband said, ''We weren't ready to do that at that
point.''
</P>
<P>
   The husband added that when the group first surrounded him and
his wife, he thought it was a joke. He also said there were several
people snapping pictures and videotaping them.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, police were working with several television stations
to obtain amateur videotape of the attacks that was aired during
Monday and Tuesday newscasts. Police hope to identify some of the
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Ludwig, attorney for defendant Tremayne Bain, 23, of
Brooklyn, said the group his client and Rowe were with have given a
videotape to police that shows the defendants were not involved in
the attacks. Police did not immediately comment on Ludwig's
assertions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tape corroborates the fact that they were about 150 yards
away when the attack (on the British tourists) took place,'' Ludwig
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rowe and Bain were charged with second-degree aggravated sexual
abuse, first-degree sexual abuse and second-degree robbery. Bail
was set at $10,000 for each, and both were still in jail Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man said anything during the brief hearing, and they did
not enter pleas. They are due back in court Friday. Rowe and Bain,
who are friends, had come into Manhattan to watch the Puerto Rican
Day parade.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the attacks, Central Park was crowded as usual on Monday
and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Central Park is my oasis away from the big city,'' said Claire
Duane, 34, of Manhattan. ''We can't let thugs like this take away
our refuge, our sense of well-being.''

<HEADLINE> MacArthur Foundation Awards Grants  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE ZIEGLER DIZON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- An architecture professor who helps design
innovative buildings in poor communities and a scholar in black
American photography were selected Tuesday as two of this year's 25
winners of $500,000 MacArthur ''genius grants.''
</P>
<P>
   The academics, artists, activists and scientists chosen by the
John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation will each receive the
money in no-strings-attached funding over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   ''My high school transcripts and my Auburn University
transcripts are proof that I'm no genius, but I'm smart enough to
take the money,'' said Samuel Mockbee, who teaches architecture at
Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   Mockbee, 55, of Canton, Miss., was chosen for his work with the
Rural Studio, a project at Auburn that he co-founded in 1992. The
studio, in Newbern, Ala., is in the middle of one of the nation's
poorest areas.
</P>
<P>
   Students at the Rural Studio design houses, churches and other
community buildings on a limited budget. Past projects have
incorporated discarded tires, bottles and even hay.
</P>
<P>
   A secret process is used to determine the MacArthur grant
winners. Recipients cannot apply, but rather are selected by
hundreds of anonymous nominators. A 13-member selection committee,
also anonymous, then makes recommendations to the foundation's
board, which makes the final picks.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Willis, curator of exhibitions for the Center for
African-American History and Culture and the Anacostia Museum at
the Smithsonian Institution, said she was shocked by her selection.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've worked in isolation for so long,'' she said. ''I never
really realized that somebody was taking note of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Willis, 52, of Washington, recently began showing her own
photographs, which focus on women at work and the black female
body.
</P>
<P>
   Other winners include Ben Katchor, a 48-year-old New York
cartoonist who draws a weekly strip on urban life called ''Hotel &AMP;
Farm.'' Katchor has also published several books of comic art that
reinvent New York history.
</P>
<P>
   Cecilia Munoz, a 37-year-old vice president with the National
Council of La Raza, a Hispanic civil rights organization, was
picked for her lobbying efforts on immigration and civil rights
issues.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest recipient among this year's fellowship winners was
Hideo Mabuchi, a 28-year-old assistant physics professor at the
California Institute of Technology. He has studied the relationship
between microscopic systems, such as atoms, and the tools used to
measure and examine them.
</P>
<P>
   He said hopes to use the grant to develop the creative side of
science education.

<HEADLINE> Suharto Family Talking With Govt.  </HEADLINE>
By PAMELA SAMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Indonesia's president said Tuesday that family
members of former autocratic President Suharto are negotiating with
the government to return any alleged ill-gotten gains from the
years of Suharto's rule.
</P>
<P>
   The family ''would like to give back the fortune ... to the
state,'' President Abdurrahman Wahid said during a speech to the
American Indonesian Chamber of Commerce in New York. He said
negotiations are under way.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's family and lawyers could not immediately be reached
for comment, but negotiations between the government and Suharto's
family would be a significant development in a possible corruption
case against the former Indonesian leader. Wahid has said he is
willing to pardon Suharto for any wrongdoing if the ex-leader
returns illegally acquired riches -- a statement he repeated
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto, 79, ruled Indonesia with an iron fist for 32 years
until riots forced him from office in 1998. He is now the top
suspect in a scandal involving the misuse of millions of dollars by
several charitable foundations controlled by his family during his
reign.
</P>
<P>
   Though Suharto continually denies any wrongdoing, his foes
accuse him of stashing much of the money overseas and using the
rest to build huge business empires for his six wealthy children.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Suharto refused to cooperate with a state graft
investigation on the grounds of ill health -- family members and
defense lawyers claim a series of strokes have left him weak and
sometimes incoherent, with dangerously high blood pressure and
mental blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated and skeptical by what they claimed were stalling
tactics, prosecutors placed the ex-leader under house arrest on May
29 and compelled him to answer questions. Indonesia's attorney
general said last week that he is confident of building a solid
corruption case against Suharto by midsummer.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid, who was elected president last year, has said he wants to
fight endemic corruption in Indonesia, reform the economy and
improve the climate for overseas investors. He reaffirmed those
commitments Tuesday in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia has pledged to give private enterprise the leeway to
operate, Wahid said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will encourage the private sector,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid is in the United States primarily for medical treatment --
he is nearly blind from a progressive eye disease. But he also met
with President Clinton in Washington on Monday and emphasized
Indonesia's commitment to reform.
</P>
<P>
   He told Clinton that achieving progress is a matter of
give-and-take.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to stress exports and investment,'' Wahid said he told
Clinton. ''I asked the United States to assist us by opening its
doors to our goods.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he asked Clinton to help Indonesia wipe out corruption
and achieve the goal of a ''clean government in Indonesia as soon
as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, Jakarta set up a high-level committee to combat
corruption. The move follows a string of scandals, including the
Suharto case and one that implicated several former top government
officials in a scheme to funnel money illegally to former President
B.J. Habibie's presidential campaign.

<HEADLINE> Athletics 6, Twins 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Miguel Tejada, Eric Chavez and Ramon
Hernandez each had three hits to lead the Oakland Athletics to a
6-5 win over the Minnesota Twins on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom third of Oakland's lineup combined for nine hits,
four runs and three RBIs to lead the Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland rookie Mark Mulder (4-2) allowed two runs, eight hits
and four walks over six innings for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Isringhausen pitched the ninth for his 16th save, allowing
a sacrifice fly to Butch Huskey.
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics were aided by eight Minnesota walks, including two
with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied at 2 in the fourth, Oakland scored twice off
Joe Mays (3-8) with help from a bungled pickoff play.
</P>
<P>
   Tejada led off the inning with a double and scored on a single
by Hernandez. After Randy Velarde's single put runners at the
corners, Mays caught Velarde leaning off first base, but a wild
throw by Twins' first baseman Ron Coomer allowed Hernandez to score
from third and Velarde to reach second on the error.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland made it 5-2 in the fifth on two-out singles by Tejada,
Chavez and Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics added a run 2 in the seventh on singles by Chavez
and Hamilton, an infield single by Terrence Long and a bases-loaded
walk to Jason Giambi.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins scored two in the seventh on Matt Lawton's RBI double
and Huskey's run-scoring groundout off Jeff Tam.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland took a 1-0 lead in the second as John Jaha walked, took
second on Tejada's single and scored on Chavez' RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics made it 2-0 in the third after opening the inning
with three walks and a single. Long walked and took third on
Velarde's single. A walk to Jason Giambi loaded the bases, and a
four-pitch walk to Stairs made it 2-0. A strikeout and double-play
grounder ended the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota tied the game in the bottom of the third on an RBI
double by Canizaro and Lawton's RBI single. Mulder struck out Brian
Buchanan with the bases loaded to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Mays allowed five runs -- four earned -- nine hits and seven walks
in six innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Jason Giambi walked in his last four at-bats, his second
four-walk game of the season. He leads the AL in walks with 58. ...
Oakland stranded 13 runners from the second through seventh
innings. ... Lawton extended his hitting streak to 11 games and has
hit safely in 15 of his last 16 games.

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted in Xerox Shootings  </HEADLINE>
By JEAN CHRISTENSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- A former Xerox copier repairman was convicted
Tuesday of gunning down seven co-workers in Hawaii's worst mass
killing.
</P>
<P>
   A jury found Byran Uyesugi, 40, guilty of first-degree murder,
which covers multiple killings, and attempted murder in the second
degree for shooting at an eighth co-worker and missing.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict means the jury believes Uyesugi was legally sane
during his Nov. 2 shooting spree at a Xerox parts warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Uyesugi's attorneys never disputed that he shot his co-workers
but argued that their client suffers from a psychosis that made it
impossible for him to appreciate the wrongfulness of his actions
that day.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Peter Carlisle acknowledged that Uyesugi suffers from
a serious mental illness, but said he was aware his actions were
wrong and killed out of anger.
</P>
<P>
   Uyesugi will be sentenced on Aug. 8 to the mandatory life in
prison without the possibility of parole. Hawaii does not have the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Uyesugi showed no emotion while the verdict was read.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was not an unexpected verdict,'' defense attorney Jerel
Fonseca said. ''The insanity defense is difficult to prove. The
insanity defense is difficult to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Uyesugi, a 15-year Xerox employee, fired a Glock 9 mm
semiautomatic handgun more than two dozen times at co-workers who
had gathered for a meeting to discuss his light workload.
</P>
<P>
   At least 28 bullet casings from a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun
were found at the scene, authorities said. Uyesugi surrendered to
police after a five-hour armed standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors argued that Uyesugi shot his co-workers out of
vengeance, retaliation and anger -- not insanity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is the defendant legally insane? The answer is no, because
Byran Uyesugi knew, understood, recognized and appreciated that
killing seven people was wrong,'' Carlisle said in closing
statements earlier Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Carlisle also said Uyesugi didn't meet the definition of legal
insanity because he exercised self-control throughout the
shootings, from planning to acting to escaping.
</P>
<P>
   Uyesugi even purposely chose not to shoot one co-worker who was
in the same general area as the seven victims.
</P>
<P>
   But Fonseca argued that Uyesugi, an avid gun collector and
tropical fish breeder, suffered from a severe mental illness --
either delusional disorder or paranoid schizophrenia -- and did not
appreciate the wrongfulness of his actions.
</P>
<P>
   ''A rational mind was not in control that day,'' Fonseca said.
''When your rationality is limited, your choices are limited.''
</P>
<P>
   Fonseca said Uyesugi believed his victims, all of whom were part
of his work team, were sabotaging his copy machines, spying on him
and mutilating his fish. He also believed he was about to be fired
and didn't want his victims to have the satisfaction of seeing him
fired.
