<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Visits Missile Test Range on Campaign Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 10 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin visited the
"Kapustin Yar" Fourth State Central Test Range in southern Russia
today, praising the range's personnel for their contribution to
the country's strategic security.
</P>
<P>
The "Kapustin Yar" Fourth State Central Test Range was set up
50 years ago to test anti-aircraft missiles to protect the
country's large political, administrative, economic, and
industrial centers.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, visiting the range at the eve of its 50th anniversary,
said: "The Russia's history is linked with that of the development
of our missiles and the exploration of outer space."
</P>
<P>
All types of Russian middle-range strategic missiles,
anti-aircraft missile systems, and most types of tactical and
operational-tactical missiles were tested there, according to the
president.
</P>
<P>
The first one-stage ballistic missile and first
missile complex was tested in "Kapustin Yar", and the first
experimental high-altitude launchings of rockets with animals on
board and soundings of the upper strata of the atmosphere were
carried out in the range.
</P>
<P>
"Kapustin Yar is not only a missile's testing ground, but a
Russian cosmodrome, too. An artificial sputnik of
the 'Intercosmos' series was placed on a near-Earth orbit for the
first time from it. This launching laid the beginning for
international cooperation on outer space," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
More than one hundred missile complexes for all the arms of the
service were tested and recommended for use at Kapustin Yar. 26
types of space apparatuses were launched from the range.
</P>
<P>
The Kapustin Yar is a multi-profile center for testing and
delivering to armed forces new types of missile complexes and for
training military experts.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin arrived at the range's satellite town of Znamensk via
Volgograd on a election campaign tour.
</P>
<P>
In Volgograd, formerly Stalingrad, Yeltsin appealed to the
citizens to support him in the presidential election scheduled in
June, saying:"If elected for the second term, I plan to go on with
the reforms, I intend to arrange for improving the well-being of
every citizen, every family."

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Visits UNEP Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has always
taken environmental protection as an important item in its state
development agenda, Chinese President Jiang Zemin said here
this morning.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while meeting Ms Elizebath Dowdeswell,
Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Program
(UNEP), in the UNEP headquarters.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang, who is on a state visit to Kenya, was paying
a visit to the UNEP headquarters located in the suburbs of
Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
He said that the environmental problem is a major challenge
faced by developing countries and the location of the
headquarters of the UNEP in Nairobi itself shows that the
international community gives importance to developing countries
in the global environment affairs.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang said that China has done much work in
environmental protection, such as in the domains of investment,
legislation and international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
As China is a large, densely populated and rapidly developing
country, the environment problem is especially outstanding in her
development, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Sustainable development is an inevitable choice and important
strategy in China's process of modernization, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"A good solution of the environment problem will be an
important contribution by China to the global environment
protection," President Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president expressed appreciation of the UNEP's
successive work in the global environmental protection and
the close cooperation between China and the UNEP.
</P>
<P>
He said he is confident that such cooperation will develop
further along with the development of the global environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
Ms Dowdeswell spoke highly of the efforts made by China in
environmental protection and the achievements it has gained in
this domain.
</P>
<P>
She said that the UNEP has maintained good cooperative
relations with China and it is her hope that the UNEP would get
more support from China.
</P>
<P>
Ms Dowdeswell said that she is looking forward to attending
China's Fourth Environmental Protection Conference.

<HEADLINE> Russian Foreign Minister Takes Azeri POWs to Baku </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov, taking 67 Azeri POWs detained in Armenia, flew to Baku
from Yerevan earlier today, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the top Russian diplomat brought 35 Armenian POWs
from Baku to Yerevan, the capital of Armenia.
</P>
<P>
The POWs were released at the request of the Russian diplomatic
"shuttle" mission headed by Primakov that is aimed at helping settle the
Nagorno-Karabakh dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia, two
former Soviet republics, a Russian Foreign Ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the POWs' release, Primakov said in Yerevan "We
have laid a very good beginning for the settlement of the
Nagorno-Karabakh conflict."
</P>
<P>
He added that observance of the ceasefire agreement in
Nagorno-Karabakh over the past two years was another serious
achievement of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Armenian President Ter-Petrosyan, who held talks with Primakov
Thursday, told reporters that the Russian minister's visit sought
assurance from both sides that they are ready to adhere to the
two-year-long armistice until a large-scale political agreement
is reached.
</P>
<P>
"The main task today," the president said, "is to prevent the
resumption of hostilities."
</P>
<P>
In Baku, Primakov is expected to hold another round of
political consultations with Azeri President Geidar Aliyev, whom
he has met Wednesday about the Nargorno-Karabakh conflict.

<HEADLINE> British Senior Official Visits Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Jeremy Greenstock, Political
Director at the Western European Department of the British
Foreign Office, wound up today his one-day visit to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
during his visit, Greenstock discussed with Cypriot officials
Britain's role in the promotion of the U.N. chief's good offices
for solving the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
In statements to the press after his meetings on the island,
Greenstock said he came to Cyprus to "update" himself with what
is in the minds on both sides of the line.
</P>
<P>
"I want to make one point here and that is that the U.K. is
not here in any sense of starting an initiative. I am here to
make sure that I am entirely up-to-date with the thinking of both
leaders on the island," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish-Cypriot community in
the north and the Greek-Cypriot community in the south since 1974
when Turkey sent troops and occupied the northern part of the
island following a short-lived coup by some Greek Cypriots seeking
union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Greenstock said there is a good deal of speculation in the
international community that things are about to move on the
Cyprus issue but this is up to the two communities on the island
and the people they consult with.
</P>
<P>
He said he was here to express an interest for his country, for
the European Union, because he works "very closely" with his
partners in the EU on the issue of Cyprus and also with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Greenstock made these remarks following a second meeting today
with Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides. Earlier, he met with
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash in the Turkish-controlled
northern part of Nicosia after his first meeting with President
Clerides and Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the meeting, government spokesman Yiannakis
Cassoulides said there was a "useful exchange of views" on the
issue of security and Britain's support to the good offices of
the U.N. chief, in cooperation with the U.S. and the EU.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unsolved despite the U.N. and
international peace effort for the past 22 years.
</P>
<P>
Britain, Greece and Turkey were guarantors of the island's
independence in accordance with the 1960 treaty establishing the
Republic of Cyprus.

WASHINGTON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Two Marine Corps helicopters with
16 people aboard collided early Friday during a U.S.-British war

</P>
<P>
At least two were killed and another two injured who were taken

Both aircraft were participating in the war games involving
thousands of British and American troops massed off the North

SEOUL, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Asia-Pacific countries and regions
need to liberalize trade and investment more to greet the coming
century, South Korean President Kim Young-sam said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the seventh annual conference of the Asia Society

Asia-Pacific nations should strengthen regional cooperation,
expand exchanges with other parts of the world and increase
dialogue on security issues.
</P>
<P>
"The forthcoming century will bring challenges as well as
opportunities for Asians. Lest it should let such challenges and
opportunities pass by, I believe, Asia must further open up and
actively move toward globalization," he said at the three-day
conference which was attended by representatives of a dozen
countries and regions including China, Japan, Singapore, Vietnam
and Hongkong.
</P>
<P>
Kim also reiterated South Korea's determination to expand

<HEADLINE> UNIDO Says No Financial Crisis After U.S. Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Chief of the United Nations
Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) said today that there
has been no financial crisis in the U.N. body after the withdrawal
of the United States last December.
</P>
<P>
Director-General Mauricio Campos told a news conference after a
board meeting that his organization has become more efficient and
its members are more active in paying their membership dues.
</P>
<P>
The United States was in arrears with its membership dues
payment and failed to promise a payment of the money when it
announced its withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Campos said that the annual board meeting ratified a reform
plan aimed at cutting budget funding, streamlining administration
and reducing staff.
</P>
<P>
The 1996-97 budget was slashed by 25 percent and its staff will
be cut down to 740 by the end of July, its staff reached as many
as 1,350.
</P>
<P>
He added that the majority of the 53 delegations to the
board meeting rejected a motion of the Netherlands to merge the
organization with the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development.
</P>
<P>
He explained that such a move won't address the interests of
the developing countries. Meanwhile, he called for a clearer
definition of scope of functions and powers of U.N. organs to
avoid confusion.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that the UNIDO is going to focus on the
implementation of a program on African industrialization.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1967, the UNIDO is mainly devoted to helping
promote and accelerate the industrialization process of the
developing countries and coordinate U.N. work in the field of
industrial development.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Winter Wheat Harvest Poorest Since 1978 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The most serious drought in the
past 100 years in the South Plains and unfavorable weather in the
Midwest will decrease the U.S. winter wheat harvest to only 1.36
billion bushels, the lowest since 1978, the Agriculture Department
reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The latest forecast, which will be 12 percent drop from last
year, shows that many farmers have abandoned acres that had been
damaged by the driest winter since 1896.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. department projected a corn crop this year of 9.7
billion bushels, up 27 percent from last year, because of
increased acreage.
</P>
<P>
However, the supply of corn coming into the September harvest
season is expected to drop somewhat. Despite rising costs of corn
and other feed, the department said red meat and poultry
production should rise in 1996 and again in 1997, in part to meet
export demand.
</P>
<P>
The department expects corn plantings will be higher than first
indicated in March because growers will try corn on some abandoned
wheat acres in the Midwest. The figure rose from 79.9 million to
81 million acres.
</P>
<P>
Because of the low harvest of winter wheat, the most important
of the U.S. wheat crops, the department said overall wheat
production should drop 5 percent this year to 2.07 billion bushels.
</P>
<P>
The poor crop also indicates wheat supplies will shrink 11
percent in the marketing year that starts June 1. Prices for the
season should climb up from 4.50 dollars to average 4.70 to 5.30
dollars a bushel.

<P>
LONDON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Queen Elizabeth II is to serve
British beef at a state dinner in honor of President Jacques
Chirac at the Buckingham Palace next week when the French guest
visits Britain, announced a Buckingham Palace spokesman this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The queen personally chose to put beef on the menu at the start
of President Chirac's four-day state visit next Tuesday, despite
the scare caused by BSE, known as mad cow disease among Britons,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
And it was the custom on state visits to serve the "best
examples of British cuisine" and beef would be among the choices,
he added.
</P>
<P>
On April 29, Prime Minister John Major also served British beef
in honor of his German counterpart, Helmut Kohl, when he paid a
one-day visit to Britain.
</P>
<P>
Britain is trying every means to urge the European Union to
lift its worldwide ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
But Germany, France, Italy and a number of other EU member
states still oppose lifting of the ban unless Britain takes tough
measures to overcome the BSE crisis.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's largest seed company,
Seed Co-op, today said it has procured record orders for more
than 5,000 tonnes of wheat seed, enough to produce 250,000 tonnes
of wheat this year.
</P>
<P>
Marketing Manager Brien de Woronin said the total seed sales
do not take into account farmers' retention which can
significantly increase the area planted to about 43,000 hectares
this year.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean wheat is grown during the winter months in
irrigated plots.
</P>
<P>
Woronin said although the estimated wheat output of the year
is bedlow national requirements of 320,000 tonnes, his country
will in 1996/97 not have to spend valuable foreign currency
importing wheat as was the case last year.
</P>
<P>
Last year's drought reduced wheat output by more than 75
percent to 85,000 tonnes, forcing the grain marketing board to
import more than 100,000 tonnes of the crop.
</P>
<P>
The good rains this year will benefit farmers, he said.

<HEADLINE> France To Boost Trade, Economic Ties With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 10 (Xinhua) -- French Ambassador to
Tanzania, Alain Du Boispean has said that France was all set to
increase its trade and other economic ties with Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, the envoy said
that the move follows the reality that trade between tanzania and
France was not as voluminous as it should be considering the great
potentiality of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"We have known each other for sometime but the trade volume is
still not that much sizeable. I think we have to open more doors
for these two countries to trade and involve themselves in other
economic activities", he suggested.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures show that the volume of trade between Tanzania
and France stands at between 150 million Francs or US dollars 13
million, too low compared to other countries like Kenya which had
more commercial links with France.
</P>
<P>
Such volume was small as it was not near that between Tanzania
and other European countries like the United Kingdom whose trade
links with Tanzania were quite significant, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Mr. du Boispean said the previous political-economic climate in
Tanzania as well as the fact that Tanzania was not France's
immediate trade partner like Franco-phone African countries were
the main reasons for the slow growth in the trade ties.
</P>
<P>
"But now political and economic doors in Tanzania have been
opened and international assistance has to be turned into
commercial partnership", he elaborated.

coordination conference here today.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, with the participation of over 100

</P>
<P>
Moreover, the per capita income increased from 118 U.S.

</P>
<P>
Chhon also noted that inflation has been reined in to 3.5
percent in 1995 from 151 percent in 1990, and the national
currency, riel, enjoys a stable exchange rate with the U.S. dollar
in the market.
</P>
<P>
Chhon, who is also the minister in charge of rehabilitation and
development, said that in 1995, the total investment in Cambodia
reached 587 million dollars, consisting of 20.5 percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
Public revenues to the national budget grew from 4.3 percent of
GDP in 1990 to nine percent in 1995, and the sources of the

BRUSSELS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission(EC) said
today it is resorting to the World Trade Organization in order to
open up the telecommunications procurement market in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
According to the EC, exporters in the European Union(EU) lose an
estimated 900 million US$ a year by being excluded from the Korean
market.
</P>
<P>
The Commission, said a EC spokesman, has therefore requested
formal consultations in the WTO against Korean measures designed to
build up a domestic telecoms industry.
</P>
<P>
Korean law now requires the main national operator, Korea
Telecom, to buy from Korean manufacturers, and the EC, said the
spokesman, "has clear indications that the second operator applies a
similar policy".
</P>
<P>
He said the EC's action had been carried out through the EU's new
"market access" strategy for opening foreign markets, and enjoyed
"wide support" from EU governments and industry.

<HEADLINE> New S.Africa Cabinet Announced Soon: Mbeki </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 10 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela wants to name a new cabinet as soon as possible to
replace officials of the National Party, Deputy Presidfent Thabo
Mbeki said today in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
The biggest white party of the country, the National Party
announced the desire to withdraw from the government in June
this year.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki told a press briefing that the ruling African
National Congress (ANC) is perfectly happy with the stay of the
Inkatha Freedom Party in the government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
The vacant seats would be filled according to the formula in
the constitution, the deputy president added.
</P>
<P>
The National Party holds five cabinet minister posts and three
deputy ministerships.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, who is also vice president of the ANC, said the
National Party's withdrawal has been accepted by the ANC without
reservation, and the ANC expects an enhanced confidence of
investors.
</P>
<P>
A speedier economic growth could "even occur as the country
achieves normality," predicted the deputy president.
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe investors around the world have any doubts
about the ANC's ability to govern," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki vowed to maintain government policies in place.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Premier Meets Opposition Leaders to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Al-Hariri held in his office today a series of meetings with the
country's prominent opposition leaders in an effort to "maintain
national unity" which was shown during the recent Israeli
aggressions.
</P>
<P>
"The recent events have strikingly made the country united,"
Hariri told reporters following the meetings. "This is a big
gain. The Lebanese should unite and it is one of our duties to
maintain this atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
"We believe that it is our first priority to complete in this
direction and to maintain this unity," Hariri said, adding, "Under
this roof there are a lot of things which could happen."
</P>
<P>
Hariri had meetings today with Suleiman Tony Franjieh, a
former minister sacked by Hariri from the government in May 1995;
Talal Arslan, a political and feud rival of Walid Jumblat,
Hariri's staunch ally and the only Deruze minister in Hariri's
government; and George Saade, chairman of the Lebanese Maronite
Christian Kataeb Party. All of them are members of the Lebanese
unicameral parliament.
</P>
<P>
These were the first meetings of the three men with the
Lebanese Sunni billionaire prime minister since he reshuffled his
government last year.
</P>
<P>
"I'm open to all and there is not a closed door," the prime
minister told reporters when he was leaving his office.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on whether he would hold meetings with
other opposition leaders, Hariri said such meetings will be
repeated with them and with others.

<HEADLINE> WHO to Convene Experts Meeting on Mad Cow Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO) is
planning to host another experts meeting to study the possible link
between the mad cow disease and its human equivalent, a new variant of
Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (V-CJD) found in the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
A WHO spokesman Friday said the UN health agency had invited about
25 experts from 17 countries for a three-day meeting on the subject on
May 14-16 at its Geneva headquarters.
</P>
<P>
A WHO-sponsored international experts meeting in early April failed
to find any proven link between the V-CJD and the mad cow disease.
However, experts attending the meeting said that exposure to the mad
cow disease might be the most likely explanation for human infection
of V-CJD. To verify the link needs further studies, they said.
</P>
<P>
The mad cow disease, or formally called Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy (BSE), first came to scientific attention in November
1986 in Britain and has since caused over 160,000 cases there and over
100 others elsewhere in Europe. The BSE agent is allegedly attributed
to 10 cases in Britain of its human equivalent, V-CJD, including eight
deaths.
</P>
<P>
The suspected link was officially announced by London on March 20
and has since provoked public panic and a ban on British beef
importation by many countries around the world.

<HEADLINE> De Klerk Defends Planned Withdrawal From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's National Party
leader F. W. de Klerk said here today that the time has come in
South Africa for a "shake-up of the party political system", a
task he aims to take on as an opposition leader.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk made the remarks one day after he announced that his
party was quitting the Government Of National Unity (GNU) in June
this year.
</P>
<P>
He told the American Chamber Of Commerce that his party's move
to the opposition benches was good news for the country.
</P>
<P>
The end of the GNU was "inevitable", and the National Party's
move was motivated by its failure to convince the African
National Congress (ANC) to continue with consensus government in
the new constitution, he said.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk saw need in South Africa for a "dynamic multi-party
political system where the majority party is challenged
effectively".
</P>
<P>
He remained "absolutely confident that the country
will succed", he said.
</P>
<P>
But he noted his party was not being petulant in walking out
of the government, rather he characterized it as a "positive
decision" that would reinvigorate the political landscape.
</P>
<P>
"I'm raring to go, we are looking forward to this wonderful
challenge," said de Klerk, referring to July 1 when his party
will move into full-time opposition.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk, who is also second deputy president of South Africa,
said his party would continue to cooperate with the ANC on some
issues of government, and he and President Nelson Mandela would
still consult each other.
</P>
<P>
He did not expect the National Party's withdrawal to effect
the policies followed in the past two years, he said.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk reassured foreign investors that he believed the ANC
would stick to the economic policy that had been formulated by
the GNU.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Pays Tribute to Anti-Colonial Fighter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
said here today that Greek Cypriots are determined to become
worthy of the heroes who fought for the island's independence.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking during the unveiling of the bust of a hero,
Michalakis Karaolis, at the main entrance of the English school
in Nicosia which the hero graduated from in 1953.
</P>
<P>
Karaolis was a member of the anti-colonial organization
fighting British rule between 1955-1959.
</P>
<P>
The school paid tribute to the hero who was executed 40
years ago at the age of 22 despite numerous appeals for
mercy to the British authorities and the Queen's council.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides, who was one of the lawyers defending
Karaolis at the time, said Greek Cypriots are determined, if
circumstances demand, "to do all we can to save Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
The President also noted that 40 years on, Cyprus is
still fighting for its national survival, to get rid of the
Turkish troops and settlers, to safeguard human rights and
fundamental freedoms for all its citizens, to secure the return
of refugees to their homes, to ascertain the fate of the
missing and to enter the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The President also paid tribute to the hero's high morale
and merits and read out extracts from letters which the hero
had sent to his family just before his death by hanging at
the Nicosia central prison.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Prepared To Welcome Jiang's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Preparations are in full swing
here to welcome a forthcoming visit to Ethiopia by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, with an atmosphere of festivity prevailing
in the Ethiopian capital.
</P>
<P>
Along a five-kilometer-long bole road from the capital's
inter- national airport to the city center, national flags of
China and Ethiopia are fluttering in the wind, pictures of
President Jiang Zemin and his Ethiopian counterpart Negasso
Gidada are put up along major streets and buildings.
</P>
<P>
One streamer reads: "Warmly Welcome, President Jiang Zemin And
The High-Level Chinese Delegation."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government-run newspaper "The Ethiopian Herald"
today carried in its front page Jiang's picture. The newspaper,
under the title " Chinese President To Make Land Mark Visit To
Ethiopia", also carried a lengthy article introducing Jiang to
the Ethiopian people.
</P>
<P>
It hails Jiang's visit as a land mark event in the relations
between China and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the official Ethiopian News Agency today aired a
story on China's economic reform and achievements in various
fields in recent years.
</P>
<P>
the story said that few countries across the world have
changed as rapidly as china has, citing a fact that china, with
only seven percent of the world's cropland and three percent of
its forests, has managed to feed 22 percent of the world's
population.
</P>
<P>
China's many political, econoimic and social reforms and
transformations are going on simultaneously, it said.
</P>
<P>
The story said that since the late 1970s, at least 170 million
of Chinese have been lifted out of poverty thanks to agricultural
reforms which raised rural income by more than 130 percent.
</P>
<P>
Citing a World Bank report, it said that China's economy is
expected to double shortly after the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> France to Help Enforce Cease-fire in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 10 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette today stressed France's "determination" to help enforce a
cease-fire understanding between Lebanon and Israel in his letters
to Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz,
</P>
<P>
The letters were conveyed to Hariri and Boueiz by French
Ambassador to Lebanon Jean-Pierre Lafon.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to the Lebanese premier, the French foreign
minister praised "the joint work in which Hariri made a
contribution for reaching the understanding on April 26," the
state-run Lebanese National News Agency reported tonight.
</P>
<P>
The understanding provided for the cease-fire between Israel
and the Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, in south
Lebanon where more than 160 Lebanese civilians had been killed in
16 days of Israeli military strike before the understanding was
reached.
</P>
<P>
De Charette also spoke highly of the "national spirit which the
Lebanese showed during the Israeli military operation in
Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
He praised "the role which Prime Minister Hariri took upon
personally during the crisis," stressing that France would be
"permanently present" on the Lebanese side just as it did during
the recent ordeal.
</P>
<P>
In the other letter to his Lebanese counterpart, de Charette
thanked the Lebanese foreign minister for the latter's "firm
cooperation" with him in his mission during a peace-making tour
of the region in the period of the Israeli aggression against
Lebanon last month.
</P>
<P>
The French foreign minister started the shuttle trip between
Damascus, Beirut and Tel Aviv on April 15 and left the region
after the April 26 understanding was reached.
</P>
<P>
De Charette said that thanks to the cooperation, he and the
Lebanese foreign minister "managed to lay solid foundations for
the April 26 understanding" which provided the civilians with
necessary defense.
</P>
<P>
The French foreign minister underlined his country's
"determination to offer effective help in the implementation of
the understanding."
</P>
<P>
"France is totally ready to make all possible efforts for the
achievement of a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East
region," de Charette said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The recent painful events have proved the firmness
of the relations between our countries and ... the Lebanese
officials and people's recognition of the French role. This will
have a profound effect."

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and South Korea agreed here
today to boost bilateral trade during the talks between the
visiting South Korean Prime Minister Lee Soo-song and his Turkish
counterpart Mesut Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
Yalim Eralp, senior aide of Yilmaz, told reporters after the
meeting that both sides agreed to promote the trade relations and
increase mutual investments.
</P>
<P>
He said the trade volume between the two countries reached 666
million U.S. dollars last year but Turkey's exports to South
Korea only stood at 100 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Both countries expressed the intention to balance the bilateral
trade quickly, said Eralp.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that South Korea wanted to buy electronic devices
made in Turkey for their own F-16 fighters and Lee promised to do
his best to enable the start of Istanbul-Seoul flight by Korean
Airlines before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Lee also announced that South Korean carmaker Hyundai will set
up a car plant in Turkey, which is seen as an important
development.
</P>

Lee arrived in Ankara Thursday for a four-day official visit
with the aim of furthering the existing friendly relations between

LUSAKA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
today urged all Zambians to use locally available resources to
develop the country's national economy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launching ceremony of a new luxury train
express service from Lusaka to the Copperbelt, Chiluba commended
the Zambia railway for its initiative to rehabilitate the coaches
from scrap.
</P>
<P>
The event indicated that the development of a nation could
depend on the people's labour, innovation and locally available
resources, instead of relying on little foreign exchange, Chiluba
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He also urged those in higher position specially in the
government organs to work harder to help improve the living
standard of the people who put them into power.
</P>
<P>
The new train express service will surely promote tourism in
the Copperbelt, he added.
</P>
<P>
The express passenger trains run daily from both Lusaka in
central Zambia and Ndola in the Copperbelt to the opposite
destination.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Upholds U.N. Peacekeeping Force's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz announced here tonight Lebanon's persistence in the
peacekeeping role of an international force in south Lebanon
after Israel's hint to cancel the U.N. force's mission in the
area.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said that it was not Israel's first attempt to
"interrupt the function" of the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon
(UNIFIL) and to "commit crimes without noticing by the United
Nations."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the subject of the UNIFIL emerged when the
United Nations published a report "holding Israel gravely
responsible" for the bombardment at a U.N. base in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 civilians were killed and a similar number of
others wounded when Israel's artillery fired at the UNIFIL's camp
at the southern Lebanese town of Kana on April 18.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. report, which was issued on May 7 based on
investigations by military experts of the international body,
said that the Israeli shelling of the U.N. camp was "unlikely the
result of gross technical and procedural errors."
</P>
<P>
Israel argued that the bombardment was carried out after the
Israeli forces detected that guerrillas of the Lebanese
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, fired Katyusha rockets
from a site very near the camp.
</P>
<P>
Israel's U.N. envoy David Peleg said that he believed the
Security Council would take into account the firing by Hezbollah
guerrillas from locations near U.N. installations when it renews
the mandate for the 4,600-strong force in July.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure that in renewing the mandate of UNIFIL they will
take into consideration the lessons and experiences from recent
episodes," Peleg said.
</P>
<P>
The multi-national force, comprising contingents from nine
countries, was set up in 1978 to restore the Beirut government's
authority over the south of the country occupied by
Israel. According to the U.N.'s resolution on UNIFIL's
establishment, the international force's mandate should be
reviewed in every six months.

MOSCOW, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Estonian President Lennart Meri
met visiting Ukrainian Prime Minister Yevgeny Marchuk in Tallin
today to discuss bilateral cooperation, according to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The reports also cited Meri's Press Secretary Larisa Ivshina
as saying that th two leaders also expressed common interests
in integration with Europe.
</P>
<P>
Marchuk arrived in the Estonian capital of Tallin earlier
today for a two-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Meri noted the importance of closer
ties with the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO). As to Tallin's willingness to obtain NATO
and EU membership, Meri said: "It will do a favor to Russia,
because we will guarantee security on its borders."
</P>
<P>
Marchuk said, for his part, that Ukraine did not claim to
want to join NATO. However, he went to say, Kiev cooperates with
the alliance on a broad range of issues and hopes Moscow will
follow suit.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also emphasized that the potential of the
bilateral free trade treaty, which has been enforced since March
14, has not been used to the full.

<HEADLINE> US Military Helicopters Collision, 14 killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Fourteen people were killed and
two others injured in a collision between two U.S. Marine Corps
helicopters early Friday morning at a Marine Corps base in North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
The collision, involving a CH-46 Sea Knight carring 14 and an
AH-1 Cobra assault helicopter with a pilot and gunner on board,
occurred at about 2 a.m. during an U.S.-British military exercise,
the largest war games between the two powers in decades, at the
Camp Lejeune Marine Corps base.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said that 14 of the 16 people on board the
helicopters were killed and the other two Marines were critically
injured. The two injured were taken to a base hospital.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the crash was not immediately known, but Marine
Corps officials said the Cobra's mission was to fly ahead of the
Sea Knight transport to secure a landing zone for the troop
carrier. Once the Sea Knight approached the zone on a planned
route, the Cobra was to swing back around. It is not clear how the
choppers crossed paths.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft were participating in Operation Purple Star, war
games involving 15,000 British troops with 27 ships and 57
aircrafts and 38,000 American troops as a coalition force against
a fictitious enemy nation off the North Carolina coast this week.
Air operations for the exercise were suspended after the crash but
had resumed by midmorning.
</P>
<P>
The collision was the second military helicopter crash in two
days in the United States. On Thursday, four people died when a
CH-53E Super Stallion crashed during a training flight at Sikorsky
Aircraft in Stratford, Conn., killing all four people aboard.
</P>
<P>
To date, 11 Marine Corps aircraft have crashed this year,
killing 19 people.
</P>
<P>
In March, the Marine Corps called a two-day halt to all
nonessential flight operations to review safety rules after a rash
of unexplained crashes.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wholesale Prices Up with Energy Costs soaring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Wholesale prices in U.S. rose
0.4 percent in April as the biggest energy prices offset the
decline in food cost, U.S. Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The 0.4 percent rise in the Producer Price Index (PPI), which
measures inflationary pressures before they reach the consumer,
followed an even bigger 0.5 percent gain in March.
</P>
<P>
The energy costs in U.S. last month jumped by the biggest
amount this year pushed by surging gasoline prices. The gasoline
prices increased by 6.1 percent following a much bigger jump of
7.1 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
But many analysts said recently the current soaring gasoline
prices in U.S. would be short-lived.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government report found that food costs dropped
0.3 percent in April, after having surged by 0.6 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
The report said that excluding food and energy, the so-called
core rate of inflation rose a much more modest 0.1 percent. The
gain was the fifth straight month of moderation for that
component.
</P>
<P>
With the 0.4 percent in the Produce Price Index in April, U.S.
inflation at the wholesale level has been rising at an annual rate
of 3 percent so far this year, higher than the 1.9 percent in
1995.
</P>

But U.S. Labor Department Secretary Robert Reich said today

<HEADLINE> Turkey Denies "Mad Cow Case" Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Health Minister Yildirim
Aktuna today denied the reports that a patient in the Aegean city
of Izmir had been diagnosed as carrying mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
"The patient reported by the press as having mad cow disease
has actually been diagnosed as suffering from Creutzfeld Jakob
Disease (CJD)," Aktuna told the Anatolia News Agency at the
opening ceremony of a health center in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an Izmir doctor has spoken out to calm the fear
sparked by the discovery of a 71-year-old man with symptoms of CJD.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ahmet Genc, the patient's doctor, said that the man was
suffering from CJD, a condition with very similar symptoms to mad
cow disease.
</P>
<P>
The patient has been in hospital for two months, suffering
from fainting and trembling of the hands and feet. Doctors say he
has a life expectancy of about six more months.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Genc said that CJD was a very rare disease that could be
expected to occur in Turkey once every two or three years.
</P>
<P>
The CJD is not a contagious disease, said Dr. Genc. It is not
a disease carried by germs or viruses, it is caused by proteins
called prions, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Mad cow" panic has caused great economic losses to Britain and
Europe as well. On March 27, the European Commission imposed a
worldwide ban on British beef exports to try to calm consumers
after Britain admitted there could be a link between mad cow
disease Bovine Spongiform Encephalophthy (BSE) and its human
equivalent.

UNITED NATIONS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali has decided to appoint David Stephen as
Director of the U.N. Mission for the Verification of Human Rights
and of Compliance with the Commitments of the Comprehensive
Agreement of Human Rights in Guatemala (MINUGUA), a U.N. spokesman
announced on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sylvana Foa, the spokesman for the secretary-general, told the
press Stephen will succeed Leonardo Franco who has headed MINUGUA
since its establishment in November 1994 and who is returning to
Geneva where he will rejoin the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
She said that Stephen, a national of the United Kingdom, has
served in the executive office of the secretary-general since 1992
and that he is a specialist in Latin American government studies
with considerable experience of immigration, refugee and
development issues in that region.
</P>
<P>
Stephen's appointment as director of MINUGUA is effective as of
June 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
In announcing the appointment, Foa said the secretary-general

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Syria today warned the Israelis that
a return to the gun diplomacy will put the Arab-Israeli talks at a
stake, requiring the United States to take on the role of a full
and neutral partner as a co-sponsor of the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
This makes it a must that all active international forces
interfere to prevent collapse of peace and preempt israel's
slighting of world consensus in favor of a just and comprehensive
peace, the state-run Damascus radio said.
</P>
<P>
It said the americans should take into account that
consolidating aggression capabilities of the Israelis risks a loss
of U.S. credibility in the eyes of parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
More than 160 Lebanese civilians were killed and some 400
wounded in 17 days of Israeli bombardment in south Lebanon last
month.
</P>
<P>
It is high time for the Israelis to realize that the policy of
concession has no place in the diction of Syrian principles,
according to the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
In spite of all difficulties, the chance of peace still stands,
said the radio.

<HEADLINE> UK Cattle Cull "at Full Speed" Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The British government announced
today that the scheme to slaughter cattle aged over 30 months will
be fully operational next week.
</P>
<P>
Tony Baldry, a minister in the Agriculture Ministry, told the
parliament that 18,000 cattle in England and Wales would be culled
next week and this would rise to 22,000 a week.
</P>
<P>
In order to allay public fears over BSE, mad cow disease, and
further to win back confidence of beef consumers, the British
government has allotted 630 million pounds (945 US dollars) for
the cattle-slaughter scheme in a bid to overcome the BSE crisis.
</P>
<P>
The British government launched the scheme on May 3, but in the
first week of the scheme, only 3,321 cattle were killed.
</P>
<P>
Baldry told the House of Commons Thursday that the scheme had
been a bit delayed because of "technical hitch".
</P>
<P>
Now the BSE crisis has entered its seventh week. The British
government is trying every means to urge the European Union to
lift its worldwide ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
However, within the British cabinet, sharp differences over the
European ban have emerged, according to a report in Financial
Times newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth, a noted
Eurosceptic, used "some of the strongest language" so far yet by
any cabinet members to accuse the EU of engaging in the "cynical
elimination" of UK beef industry.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Tory conference in Aberdeen Thursday, He told
delegates: "What I cannot live with is seeing one of our most
productive and efficient industries being put on the rack for good
reason".
</P>
<P>
As the Scottish Secretary, he had refused to encourage schools
in Scotland to fly the European flag to mark Europe Day on
Thursday, saying that he would put the flag out when the EU lifts
the ban on British farmers.
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine defended the EU,
saying that many countries had already banned British beef several
years before the EU ban.
</P>
<P>
So "the solution we need to find must be a European one," he
told the conference.
</P>
<P>
He insisted: "Ultimately it is the consumers of this country,
Europe and the wider world who we need to satisfy and convince of
the safety of British beef"
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he added, the government was working with the
European partners to devise the most efficient measures to achieve
this end.

<HEADLINE> Major, Bruton May Attend Ulster Talks Launch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
and his Irish counterpart John Bruton are considering to attend
the launch of all-party talks on the future of Northern Ireland to
be convened on June 10, revealed the Irish Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Bruton in a telephone conversation on Wednesday urged Major to
attend the talks launch and stressed that it would be helpful if
the British prime minister made a major speech offering
reassurances that the talks would be serious, the report said.
</P>
<P>
During the telephone call initiated by Dublin, the two leaders
reviewed the damaged peace process and preparations for the
opening of the planned talks process.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed what role would be played by George
Mitchell, former US senator who chaired the international
commission to oversee the arms decommissioning by the rival
paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The Irish side believed that Mitchell's re-engagement could be
crucial to attempts to have the IRA cease-fire reinstated.
</P>
<P>
But there was still no understanding between London and Dublin
as to what would happen on June 10 or how the British government
intends to prevent the arms decommissioning issue from blocking
talks on all other issues.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the Irish government is set to exert
pressure on the British government over the coming week to define
how the talks process is to be advanced.

<HEADLINE> UK Factory Output Falls for 2nd Quarter in A Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- British manufacturing industry
continues to stagnate, after factory output recorded its second
successive quarterly fall in the first three months of the year,
official figures showed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to figures published Thursday by the Office for
National Statistics (ONS), manufacturing output increased just o.2
percent in March after rising 0.1 percent in February and 0.4
percent in January.
</P>
<P>
As a result, factory output was 0.2 percent lower in the first
quarter of this year than in the final quarter of last year. This
was the second quarterly fall in a row.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers of textiles, metals, fuels, wood, plastic and
paper products all cut production during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said that weak export and a build-up of unsold goods
have led many manufacturers to cut production and meet demand from
the storeroom shelf. Output is now no higher than at its
pre-recession peak in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Industrial production, which includes energy production, mining
and oil extraction as well as manufacturing, rose by 0.2 percent
in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The ONS estimated that total industrial output, which accounts
for 28 percent of the total economy, would fall in the coming
months.
</P>
<P>
Some economists said that things should be good for
manufacturers in the second half of the year, with European
economies improving and the consumer spending at home continues to
rise.

LHASA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Two Tibetan waifs wandering in the
streets for a long time have returned to school with the help of
servicemen of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA).
</P>
<P>
Twelve-year-old Mima Soinam and 11-year-old Cering Toinzhub
were seen playing day after day around the camp of a PLA company
stationed in Gonggar County, Shannan Prefecture, in southwest
China's Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Political Instructor Lin Junmin asked them: "Why don't you go
to school?"
</P>
<P>
Mima Soinam replied that he had dropped out of school because
his mother, his only relative, died when was a third-year pupil in
a local primary school one year before. Since then he had been
wandering in the streets.
</P>
<P>
Cering Toinzhub, who lives with his sick mother, said he had no
chance to go school because of poverty.
</P>
<P>
After learning that the two kids were anxious to go to school,
Lin felt that he had a responsibility to help them realize their
dreams.
</P>
<P>
Lin and another officer in his company collected money from the
other soldiers in their unit to help the two children.
</P>
<P>
On April 17 Mima Soinam and Cering Toinzhub, wearing new
clothes and carrying new schoolbags bought by their PLA friends,
arrived happily at school.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Women's volleyball team
continued its winning streak by beating the United States 3-1
Friday night at the second of a 4-game series in Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
China came from a first set down to take the game 3-15, 15-6,
15-13 and 15-11 at Rimac Arena on the University of California San
Diego campus.
</P>
<P>
The visiting team defeated the American counterpart with a
similar 3-1 result in their first meet on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The United States thoroughly dominated the first set, scoring
the first six points and eventually extending it to 10-3 before
the coup de grace.
</P>
<P>
In the second set, however, the Chinese surged out to a 8-3,
then a 14-6 lead before sealing the set.
</P>
<P>
With the United States leading 4-3 in the third set, smoke from
an undetermined source began to permeate the arena, whiche forced
the play to break for several minutes.
</P>
<P>
The smoke, thoughtly to be caused by a blown fuse in the
air-conditioning system, seemed to short-circuit the American
attack as China got four unanswered points to go up 7-4 and since
never relinquished its edge.
</P>
<P>
But the host team closed it to 14-13 before China grasped the
key chances to win the set.
</P>
<P>
With a 2-1 lead, the Chinese girls fought vigorously and
resulted in a 15-11 fourth set victory.
</P>
<P>
The two teams will continue their series through Saturday and
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Government's Request for Emergency Land Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government suffered a
legal blow today as an independent Okinawa panel rejected its
request for emergency use of a land plot in a U.S. military
facility, local press reported.
</P>
<P>
The Okinawa Prefectural Land Expropriation Committee said the
central government had failed to provide a sufficient explanation
of the need for emergency appropriation of the land, the lease
contract of which expired at the end of March.
</P>
<P>
The committee added the government's insistence that the case
was in the public interest had not been established.
</P>
<P>
The decision will force the government to continue to use the
land without a solid legal basis while it goes through a
time-consuming, non-emergency-use process that will include an
open session with the landowner, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The central government officials say the continued use of the
land within the U.S. Navy's Sobe communications facility in the
southernmost island prefecture is justified under the Japanese
government's obligation in the Japan-U.S. security pact to provide
land for U.S. bases.
</P>
<P>
However, landowner Shoichi Chibana, an anti-military activist,
has steadfastly refused to renew the least on his 236-square-meter
plot of land, part of a 530,000-square-meter tract on which the
communications facility stands.
</P>
<P>
The property dispute flared up last November when Okinawa
Governor Masahide Ota refused to sign documents for the continued
forced leasing of land, following the public outcry over the rape
of a local elementary schoolgirl last September by
U.S. servicemen.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Japan's ruling coalition has agreed
to raise the consumption tax from 3 to 5 percent next April and
will review extraordinary income tax cuts separately, Kyodo News
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The tripartite coalition made the decision even though they are
aware of the nation's slow economic recovery, Kyodo quoted
political sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sources said a formal decision by the ruling bloc will be
made by its project team within this month, well
ahead of the deadline set at the end of September.
</P>
<P>
The coalition is made up of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's
Liberal Democratic Party, the Social Democratic Party and New
Party Sakigake.
</P>
<P>
The government's Tax Commission decided last month to terminate
extraordinary income tax cuts implemented over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
But senior ruling party officials said income tax cuts will be
necessary in fiscal 1997 to offset the increased burden stemming
from the consumption tax hike.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese Education Ministry has
approved for the first time junior high school textbooks that
refer to "comfort women," Kyodo News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The reference was made in textbooks on social studies compiled
by seven publishers, Kyodo said. The textbooks will be put into
use next spring.
</P>
<P>
Senior high school textbooks have already referred to the
plight of the women who were forced by the wartime Japanese
government to provide sex for its front-line soldiers before and
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Historians estimate that between 100,000 and 200,000 women,
mostly from the Korean Peninsula which was then under Japanese
colonial rule, were forced into sexual slavery.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government has rejected a recent U.N. report
urging it to compensate the surviving women in state coffers'
money and punish those responsible for their recruitment, saying
that the issue was settled as part of war reparations paid by the
government.

<HEADLINE> Vice-President Calls for Better Investment Environment in Pudong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Rong Yiren
has called on Shanghai's Pudong New Area to improve its investment
environment to speed up its development and opening-up.
</P>
<P>
Rong, ending a two-week inspection trip to Shanghai today, said
that Pudong has made remarkable progress in overall planning and
infrastructure construction over the past six years.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the Pudong New Area, which enjoys a number
of policy privileges granted by the central authorities, has aimed
at facilitating the opening-up and economic growth in the eastern
part of China, as well as in Shanghai, one of the nation's
economic powerhouses.
</P>
<P>
Having visited the area, Rong asked local officials to pay
closer attention to functional development while placing emphasis
on infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
"Construction of hardware and software should be promoted
simultaneously so that more investment will pour in from both home
and overseas," he said.
</P>
<P>
While meeting officials of local textile industries during the
trip, Rong said that although a number of textile enterprises have
been facing difficulties in recent years, most officials and
workers have worked hard to overcome them.
</P>
<P>
It is essential that enterprises continue to develop new
products in line with market demands, and strive to improve
quality while reducing costs, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged enterprises to inject their limited funds into
technological renovations so as to maintain a momentum in future
growth.
</P>
<P>
When visiting some Sino-foreign joint ventures during the trip,
Rong also stressed the importance of strengthening the abilities
of domestic technological undertakings, while importing foreign
advanced technology.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Consumers Buying More Luxurious Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Citizens of Guangzhou, one of the
richest cities of China, are buying more upbeat commodities for
enjoyment and entertainment rather than merely shopping for daily
necessities, a new survey shows.
</P>
<P>
Since the per-capita income of the city has grew by an average
27 percent over the past five years, reaching 8,553 (1.030 US
dollars) in 1995, the citizens have more financial strength to buy
durables ranging from color televisions to home hi-fi acoustics
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that every 100 households in the city owns 111
television sets, 102 refrigerators, 105 washing machines, 66
cameras, 57 air conditioners, 160 electric cookers, and 41 hi-fis.
</P>
<P>
Because of the constantly rising consumption power, Guangzhou
citizens are busy replacing old household appliances with more
modern and remote controlled models.
</P>
<P>
The abundant market supply, stable prices and the improved
quality of the commodities are serving as a spur to the buying
boom, the survey indicates.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Tourism Quality Supervision Office Helps Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, May 11 (Xinhua) -- A Singaporean tourist recently wrote
a letter of thanks to the Fujian Provincial Tourism Quality
Supervision Office offering praise for the way it promptly handled
a complaint.
</P>
<P>
While visiting Fuzhou, capital city of Fujian, a year ago he
found that 300 US dollars in his purse kept by the hotel where he
lived was missing. He then went to the hotel authorities and
compensation was promised.
</P>
<P>
However, a year later the case was still unresolved.
</P>
<P>
Learning of the tourism quality supervision office, he filed a
complaint in the hope of being lucky.
</P>
<P>
To the visitor's satisfaction and surprise, the office handled
the complaint in a very short time, prompting him to write the
letter of thanks.
</P>
<P>
Since its founding in August 17, 1995, Fujian Tourism Quality
Supervision Office has already handled 13 tourist complaints
according to relevant Chinese law.
</P>
<P>
Provincial tourism authorities believe that the office which
works to protect the interests of tourists will continue to help
promote the tourism industry in the coastal Fujian Province in
east China.

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Step up Assistance to Palestine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank is planning to
increase its loans to the Palestinian autonomy to help the
Palestinians to cope with economic strains caused by the Israeli
closure on the Gaza Strip and West Bank in the wake of suicide
bombing attacks in Israel, reported Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
A World Bank official said that the bank is expected to
approve loans totaling 65 million U.S. dollars by the end of June,
 designed to rebuild infrastructure and create jobs.
</P>
<P>
The first sum of 40 million dollars is slated to be considered
by the bank board this month. Donor countries will also provide
additional 30 million dollars to the project.
</P>
<P>
The second sum of 25 million dollars, to be used for water and
sewage facilities, will be approved in June.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, representatives of 40 donor countries plan to meet
in Paris on June 27 to map up ways to improve the critical
economic situation in Palestine.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Washington, Palestinian Authority (PA)
President Yasser Arafat spoke bitterly of the restrictions imposed
by Israel on the movement of Palestinian laborers.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters at the National Press Club that the closure
is costing the PA 6 million dollars a day, and complained about
the slow pace of the delivery of funds pledged by the donor
countries. "This year the PA received 27 million dollars instead
of the 450-470 million dollars we were pledged," he said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank declared on May 1 to grant the PA 20 million
dollars toward infrastructure projects in the Palestinian
countryside, including road and water networks. An agreement on
the sum was signed in Washington by the PA minister of local
government and municipal and village affairs, Saeb Erekat, and the
World Bank representative for the Middle East and North Africa.

<HEADLINE> Orbis Hospital to Bring Light to Chinese Eye Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- A team of flying doctors touched
down in Kunming today to give dozens of Chinese patients a sight
for sore eyes.
</P>
<P>
The plane carrying 26 oculists, sent by the Orbis International
Flying Eye Hospital, landed with eye specialists from 12
countries. They will give medical treatment to over 40 Chinese
people suffering cataracts, glaucoma and other serious eye
diseases.
</P>
<P>
During their 20 day stay in the capital of the southwestern
Yunnan Province, they will also give Chinese eye doctors and
nurses medical training, and conduct academic exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The international oculists flew in at the invitation of
provincial governor He Zhiqiang.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Jinhui, in charge of the hospital's Asian affairs, said
that another three groups of experts will arrive in Kunming in
several days.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that the visits aim at increasing attention to the
cure of blindness and encouraging more people to donate their
corneas after death.
</P>
<P>
Since 1982, the flying hospital has paid 17 visits to
China. Over 1,000 patients suffering from eye problems have
received medical treatment aboard aircraft operating theatres and
clinics.
</P>
<P>
Orbis International Flying Eye Hospital consists of over 600
first-class oculists from 29 countries. The hospital staff have
cured 18,000 patients aboard their planes, helping most to recover
their eyesight.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Forecasts Poor Wheat Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
But experts warned that grain reserves are still expected to
fall to their lowest levels in nearly five decades this summer
before the new crops of winter wheat are harvested.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Department said that the winter wheat crop,
which is the major source of bread flour and accounts for 70
percent of the nation's wheat, would total 1.36 billion bushels
when it is harvested this summer, down 12 percent from last year,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The worst drought in a century in Kansas and neighboring
wheat-growing regions is expected to force farmers to abandon
millions of acres of wheat, it said.
</P>
<P>
High grain prices are also forcing livestock and poultry
farmers to cut production, according to the report. For the next
few months, higher slaughter rates are likely to drive down meat
prices at the supermarket and offset increases in pasta and other
grain products. That could keep food inflation in general less
than 3 percent, according to projections of most economists.

<P>
NANNING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Pingxiang City on the
Sino-Vietnamese border had seen the setting up of over 1,000
businesses and offices by investors from all over China and
overseas by the end of April.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics also show that 18 enterprises involving a
total direct overseas investment of over 80 million US dollars
have been launched in the border city, which was designated in
1992 by the State Council as an open city enjoying economic
treatment more preferential than coastal cities.
</P>
<P>
Pingxiang which is linked with other parts of the country by a
railway and a national highway, and with Viet Nam by a railway and
a highway and two ports of entry, is thought to be ripe for
attracting outside investment.
</P>
<P>
While injecting huge funds in improving infrastructure, the
city authorities have devoted great efforts in the construction
of two large border trade points in Nongrao and Puzhai which have
helped pushed up economic exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The Dongxing Economic Development Zone which enjoys the same
preferential policies as Pingxiang, and which is linked with
Viet Nam by water and highway, is also also drawing increasing
outside investment.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by April, the zone had seen the setting up
of 10 processing businesses involving investment from other parts
of China and overseas.
</P>
<P>
In addition, enterprises from all over the country had
launched 958 commercial and industrial enterprises in the zone.

<P>
DAMASCUS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo
and his party arrived here this afternoon from Jordan via a land
route.
</P>
<P>
Receiving the visitors at the Syrian-Jordanian borders were
Syrian Deputy Prime Minister Salim Yassin and Governor of Daraa
Province Walid Ali Othman.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Wu Bangguo Xinhua that China and Syria were
old friends whose friendly relations have witnessed satisfactory
development since the establishing of the diplomatic relations
more than 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Syrian relations are based on the five principles of
peaceful coexistence, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The two countries enjoyed mutual support and held identical or
similar viewpoints and stances on various international issues, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Under the current international conditions the ties between the
two countries require more high-level exchanges and further
deepening of these friendly relations and cooperation, Wu Bangguo
underlined.
</P>
<P>
He added that he was looking forward to exchanging views with
Syrian officials on the bilateral relations and seeing for himself
the great achievements made by the Syrian people in developing the
national economy under the leadership of President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
He voiced the hope that his visit would contribute to the
consolidation and development of the Sino-Syrian relations and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yassin welcomed the visit of Wu Bangguo and his
party, saying "the bilateral ties between the two countries are
time-honored and traditional and we hope that this visit will
strengthen them in all fields."
</P>
<P>
"We hope also that the visit will be fruitful in serving the
common interests of the peoples of the two countries," Yassin
added, noting that "our main task is to work out the suitable
formulas of the mutual benefits and common interests of the two
countries."

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Buses Are A Ticket To Ride </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Visitors to the south China city
of Guangzhou are really given a ticket to ride when they board a
local bus.
</P>
<P>
In many parts of China bus travel means travelling like
sardines crammed in old, often unclean buses.
</P>
<P>
But in Guangzhou bus travel is a delightful surprise for
passengers.
</P>
<P>
Having been used to unattractive and often unclean buses of
many other Chinese cities, they find Guangzhou's comfortable and
attractive buses a welcome change.
</P>
<P>
The new buses have generated a boost in passenger flow for the
city's public transport sector, thanks also to a major management
shake-up in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Losses are a long-standing reality for public transit systems
across China, as the sector usually operates as a public facility,
and profits have never been much of a consideration.
</P>
<P>
But since 1993 Guangzhou has been reshuffling its public
transport companies by displacing redundant workers and reducing
operation costs.
</P>
<P>
With most of the buses equipped with automatic ticketing
machines, tens of millions of yuan were saved each year, savings
used to improve buses and expand capacity, and bus companies no
longer need state subsidies.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, overseas funds and management styles have been
introduced to help improve the efficiency of the whole sector.
</P>
<P>
At present, 1,800 buses running on 106 routes are equipped with
automatic ticketing machines, and ICs (intelligent card) have
started to be used in a new electronic ticketing system. It all
adds to a public transport system racing ahead in the popularity
stakes among the growing number of passengers.

has slashed land-use fees by half for enterprises in the city's
Bonded Zone within the coming five years. The aim is to make the
zone equal to taxation levels in coastal Special Economic Zones.
</P>
<P>
The city also wants to lower the zone's land price to make it
the lowest among the country's bonded zones.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Customs Department will set up a branch in the
Tianjin zone where local enterprises can complete reporting their
exports and imports at the same time through an electronic data
interchange(EDI) service.
</P>
<P>
These are some new measures taken by local government which is
focusing efforts on building the city into an international free
port, and attracting more foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The city will provide preferential policies to encourage
foreign investors to develop manufacturing industries within the
zone.
</P>
<P>
A container delivery center supervised by local customs is
taking shape, aiming to develop entrepot trading.

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto to Issue Letters of Apology to Sex Slaves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto has decided to send letters of apology to Asian women
forced to provide sex for Japanese soldiers before and during
World War II, Kyodo News Service reported today.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto has given instructions to the Cabinet Councillors'
Office on External Affairs to study the wording of the letters,
which are to be sent along with compensation payments from a
private fund, Kyodo quoted government sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister has however avoided making any definite
comment on whether he would issue such letters, an attitude seen
by supporters of the women as a retrogression from the stance held
by his predecessor Tomiichi Murayama.
</P>
<P>
When the government-instigated Asian Women's Fund was
inaugurated last July as an event marking the 50th anniversary of
the end of the war, then Prime Minister Murayama said he would
extend letters of apology to the survivors of the sexual slavery.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Hashimoto's decision to issue the letters may
have been partly motivated by the recent resignation of Mutsuko
Miki, the widow of former Prime Minister Takeo Miki, from the post
as a promoter of the private fund, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the contents of the letters are likely to be
in line with a statement announced by the government in August
1993 under then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, which expressed
"apology and regret from the heart" to the former sex slaves.
</P>
<P>
As the first batch of payments from the fund, its operators
plan to start making one-time payments of 3 million yen (30,000
U.S. dollars) in July or later to each of the 300 or so surviving
women in South Korea, the Philippines and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government has maintained a policy of not
extending compensation from state coffers despite a U.N. report
calling for compensation and punishment of those responsible for
the recruitment of the women.
</P>
<P>
Historians estimate that between 100,000 and 200,000 women,
mostly from the Korean Peninsular which was then under Japanese
colonial rule, were forced into sexual servitude at
military-managed front-line brothels for the now-defunct Japanese
Imperial Army.

<TEXT>
<P>

Ethiopian capital.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, accompanied by Ethiopian President Negasso Gidada and a
group of government ministers, laid the wreath solemnly to the
monument located in the city center.
</P>
<P>
The monument was set up by the goverment of Emperor Haile
Selassie in 1943 to commemorate the Ethiopian martyrs who
sacrificed their lives in the struggle against Italian fascists
from 1936 to 1945.
</P>
<P>
A military band played music for the wreath-laying ceremony,
and the words written on the ribon attached to the wreath read:
"Salute to the Martyrs Who Bravely Fought the Fascist
Aggression."
</P>
<P>
There is an atmosphere of festivity in the capital today with
the national flags of China and Ethiopia hung along major streets
fluttering in the wind.
</P>
<P>
One streamer over the street near the monument reads "Long
Live the Long-Standing Friendship betweeen the Peoples of
Ethiopia and China," while another says "Peace and Prosperity for
the Peoples of Ethiopia and China."
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who arrived here earlier today to enhance friendship
and promote cooperation between the two countries, was welcomed
by Negasso at the Bole International Airport. Jiang and Negasso
are expected to hold talks later today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, among
other Chinese officials, was present at the wreath-laying
ceremony, which was part of Jiang's activities in his three-day
state visit to Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
KATMANDU, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Five international climbers have
been reported missing from Mt. Qomolangma, the Nepalese Tourism
Ministry announced on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The mountaineers were hit by high winds and cloudy weather
Friday on the world's highest mountain. Most were returning to the
base camp in the fading light of the afternoon when they
apparently lost their way, said the Ministry spokesman Hari Saran
Shreshta.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry identified them as two Americans Scott Fischer and
Seaborn B. Weather; Yasuko Namba of Japan; Andrew Michael Harris
of New Zealand. The name of the fifth missing climber was not
immediately available.
</P>
<P>
Namba and Harris, members of an International Friendship
Expedition, had scaled the 8,848-meter peak on Friday.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Chen Yu-nan, 37-year-old climber from Chinese
Taipei, died after he slipped 25 meters from a 7,300 meters high
point, the spokesman said. He was a member of the first Chinese
Taipei expedition to the Himalayas.
</P>
<P>
Over 600 climbers have scaled the peak in the last four
decades. Nearly 100 people have died during the expedition.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- China is the world's top producer
of bee products, with the humble bumble bee helping to net the
country almost one billion yuan a year.
</P>
<P>
China previously produced only two bee products -- honey and
beeswax -- because of outmoded breeding methods. With the
introduction of foreign bee breeds and advanced breeding
techniques, the industry has been boosted.
</P>
<P>
China now produces 200,000 tons of honey a year, 1,000 tons of
royal jelly, 1,000 tons of bee pollen, 400 tons of bee glue, 500
to 600 tons of beeswax and over 50 kg of bee venom.
</P>
<P>
Its production of royal jelly accounts for over 80 percent of
the world's total.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that consumption of the totally natural and
nutritious bee products will continue to increase in China.

<HEADLINE> UNCTAD Calls For Assisting Least Developed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MIDRAND, SOUTH AFRICA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. conference
on trade and development today called for helping African
nations, especially the least developed countries (LDCS),
integrate into the world economy.
</P>
<P>
This was stressed by the ninth session of UNCTAD at the
plenary closing meeting in Midrand, some 20 kilometers north of
Johannesburg, in its final document entitled "a partnership for
growth and development in a globalizing and liberalizing world
economy."
</P>
<P>
Delegates from 188 members of UNCTAD participated in the
closing session of the two-week UNCTAD IX which also published
"Midrand Declaration".
</P>
<P>
The 31-page document said, "a particular challenge for the
international community is the integration of developing
countries into the global economy. Many of these countries,
particularaly in Africa, risk being left behind and marginalized
in world trade, investment, commodities and capital markets."
</P>
<P>
"Ongoing intensive efforts are needed to help developing
countries, in particular the LDCS, to benefit from the process of
global trade liberalization," said the document.
</P>
<P>
States in Africa and LDCS, it noted, need "commodity and
market diversification" which requires investment, human
resources development, technological capacities, skills and
support infrastructure to augment their levels of production and
efficiency."
</P>
<P>
LDCS remain confronted with a high level of debt service,
which has been one impediment to their development efforts, it
said, and urged the developed countries to reduce their debt
burden so as to create necessary conditions for their economic
growth and sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
It also urged the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank to expedite the ongoing consideration of ways to address the
issue of their multilateral debt.
</P>
<P>
There were 48 IDCS in the world in 1995 as defined by the
World Bank and 33 of them are in Africa.
</P>
<P>
There have been very few flows of foreign direct investment
(FDI) to the IDCS, and in particular into africa where the
existing opportunities may need to be further promoted, the
document said.
</P>
<P>
It called for more flows of FDI and official development
assistance (ODA) into IDCS and Africa so as to help them build a
better economy.
</P>
<P>
The document encouraged preference-giving countries to improve
and renew their schemes of the generalized system of preferences
(GSP) in keeping with the post-Uruguay round trading system and
with the objective of integrating developing countries,
especially LDCS, into the international trading system.
</P>
<P>
"Ways and means should be found to ensure more effective
utilization of GSP schemes, particularly by LDCS," it noted.

<HEADLINE> Emphasis on Actions to Adhere to One-China Principle: Xinhua Commentator (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Authorities in Taiwan have been
urged to take actual action to adhere to the "one-China" principle.
</P>
<P>
An article by a Xinhua special commentator issued today in
Beijing said that relationships across the Taiwan Straits can grow
steadily if the Taiwan Authorities keep to the "One-China"
principle, not only in words but also in deeds.
</P>
<P>
Since last June, the article noted, major achievements have
been made by the Chinese people in their struggle against
separatist activities and so-called Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
This fully shows the determination and capability of the entire
Chinese people to oppose splittism and Taiwan independence, and to
safeguard the "one-China" principle and state sovereignty and
territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
At present, more and more Taiwan compatriots have come to
realize that to practise Taiwan independence and splittism and
sabotage the "one-China" principle will inevitably lead to tense
relations across the Taiwan Straits. This will damage Taiwan
economic growth and social stability and finally harm the
self-interests of its residents.
</P>
<P>
So compatriots across the Taiwan Straits have demanded that the
Taiwan Authorities take actual actions to really stand on the side
of "one-China" principle, the article said.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, some people acting under the instructions of
the Taiwan Authorities have asserted that the two sides of the
Taiwan Straits belong to the People's Republic of China on the one
side, and to "the Republic of China" on the other, claiming that
"the name of China is an abstract concept, and it will appear in
future," and "no country in the world has been named as China".
</P>
<P>
At the same time they also attempt to defend the Taiwan
Authorities' splittist activities internationally of creating "two
Chinas" and "one-China and one-Taiwan", professing that the Taiwan
Authorities have never run counter to the "one-China" principle
and Taiwan has the right to participate in the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Actually those absurdities are nothing new; they have just
changed the way that they have been repeated about what the Taiwan
Authorities have previously alleged.
</P>
<P>
It is known to all that China is a civilized ancient country
with a history of 5,000 years, covering a territory of 960 square
kilometers with Taiwan as its unalienable part, embracing a 1.2
billion-population including 21 million Taiwan compatriots.
</P>
<P>
The majority of countries in the world, as well as the United
Nations, have acknowledged that there is only one China in the
world and Taiwan is part of it. This is an objective reality and
by no means an abstract concept.
</P>
<P>
The article said that some people in Taiwan run counter to the
facts, not because of their ignorance, but because of ulterior
motives.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Remembers China's Poor Mums ... on Mothers Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- She was just two-and-half-years
old, cradled in her grandmother's arms. But the toddler happily
placed a ten yuan note into a collection box. She wanted to do her
best on the eve of Mother's Day.
</P>
<P>
The girl, named Wang Ting, was among 10,000 people who gave
donations to help mothers in China's poverty-stricken areas escape
the problems of a poor life.
</P>
<P>
At present over 60 million people in China are living below the
poverty belt, 10 million of them mothers in poor families. Of the
poor mothers, over 80 percent are illiterate, and around 50
percent suffer from women's diseases.
</P>
<P>
Last year China launched a "Happiness Project" to raise money
both at home and abroad to help wipe out poverty, illiteracy and
disease for China's poor mums.
</P>
<P>
Wang Guangmei, standing committee member of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference and director of the
project's organizing committee, travelled to port city Tianjin to
attend today's donation activities for the project.
</P>
<P>
The donation activities were carried out across the city
today. Nine big stores held voluntary sale activities, while
well-known actors gave voluntary performances.
</P>
<P>
He Qi, a woman who lost her job, was the first person to donate
money to the Happiness Project.
</P>
<P>
"As a woman who has experienced hardships and living
difficulties, I know what a mother needs to do for her children
and her family," she said.
</P>
<P>
The woman donated 1,000 yuan, a worker's two months' salary, to
the Happiness Project.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Yuru, executive deputy director of the project's Tianjin
Organizing Committee, donated 20,000 yuan which is a population
prize for her to the project.
</P>
<P>
Employees at the Tianjin Auto Industry Company donated 110,000
yuan to the project.
</P>
<P>
The city has already collected over one million yuan (about
120,000 US dollars), money that will be distributed to poor
mothers in other parts of the country.

<P>
But several years later the Taiwan Authorities went back on
their words, advocating that "Taiwan is an independent sovereign
country," and pursuing the policy of so-called pragmatic diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
They also did their utmost to accelerate the development of
official ties with some countries, attempting to seek "dual
recognition" and join international organizations in which only
sovereign countries can participate.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, during a meeting on working affairs between the
two organizations, the Taiwan Authorities tried again and again to
advocate splittism and "separate autonomy", the article said.
</P>
<P>
The above-mentioned assertions were aimed at seeking a
theoretical basis to turn Taiwan, the islands of Penghu, Jinmen
and Mazu into "an independent sovereign country".
</P>
<P>
In essence it asserted that "two Chinas" in stages is no
different from Taiwan independence, just donning an "overcoat" of
"seeking reunification".
</P>
<P>
In January of last year the Chinese President Jiang Zemin put
forward an eight-point proposal on the promotion of the peaceful
reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
It clearly pointed out that the advocation of splittism and
"separate autonomy" and "two Chinas" in stages all run counter to
the "one-China" principle, which is firmly opposed by the Chinese
people.
</P>
<P>
The present problem is that the Taiwan Authorities are not
willing to adhere to "one-China" principle even in words. It is
doubtful about what actions they may take.
</P>
<P>
The article stressed that it is Chinese government's consistent
stand to adhere to "one-China" principle and firmly oppose "two
Chinas" and "one China, one Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
It is high time for the Taiwan Authorities to take concrete
actions since they have made committment that the two sides of the
Taiwan Straits should keep to "one-China" principle and expressed
their desire to improve the relations across the Taiwan Straits,
the article concluded.

<HEADLINE> Scholars Gather to Discuss Education on Consumers' awareness in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 11 (Xinhua) -- More than 30 scholars and experts as
well as officials from Hong Kong, Macao and China's mainland
gathered here today for a one-day seminar to discuss education on
the improvement of consumers' awareness of their rights.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that it is increasingly important to raise the
awareness of consumers' rights through proper means of education
so that they know how to protect their rights and create a better
social environment for fair dealings.
</P>
<P>
Pamela Chan, an expert from Hong Kong, said that such education
has been widely conducted in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Repeated broadcasts on TV and radio, giving handouts to
citizens, publishing consumers' magazine, press conferences,
exhibitions and lectures have greatly helped improve the awareness
and protect consumers' rights.
</P>
<P>
Another expert from Macao, Alexandre Ho, chairman of the
executive council of the Macao Consumers' Council, said that the
council plans to expand its cooperation with neighboring regions
in the education and to push the government to add such education
to school courses.
</P>
<P>
In Zhuhai City, education on consumption has been conducted in
many primary and middle schools, and has been widely applauded by
students.
</P>
<P>
Experts from Zhuhai said that the education has paid off. Many
students have become helping hands to their parents after they
took the course. Some parents have begun to demand compensation
when they were cheated in consumption.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Accuses U.S. of Building Tensions on Peninsular </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) today criticized the U.S. for "continuously
aggravating the tensions on the Korean Peninsular" by reinforcing
its troops in South Korea and the South Korean troops with hi-tech
equipment.
</P>
<P>
In an article, the Rodong Sinmun said the U.S. decided to
deploy reconnaissance planes equipped with sophisticated
electronic devices in South Korea on June 30 and transferred
sea-launched missiles worth hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars
to South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. move has aroused great apprehensions among the Korean
people and the peace-loving peoples of the world, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
The "bellicose elements" of the United States, which are trying
to stifle the DPRK by force at any cost, are driving the situation
on the Korean Peninsular to the brink of war and encouraging South
Korea to North-South confrontation, it said.
</P>
<P>
The paper added that the United States has supplied several
billion dollars worth of modern equipment to its forces in South
Korea in recent years and provided about one billion dollars worth
of equipment to South Korea in the 12 months before September.
</P>
<P>
These activities add up to the fact that the U.S. is the "root
cause" of tension on the peninsular, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It warned that confrontation on the peninsular will not benefit
the United States. Rather, it should ponder over the "grave
consequences" of its "reckless acts."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: VMs Riot, Big Problem to HK's Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 11 (Xinhua) -- With the riot of the Vietnamese
migrants (VMs) in the Whitehead Detention Center hitting the
headlines of all local newspapers today, the VMs problem has
raised great concern of Hong Kong communities.
</P>
<P>
Many dignitaries and associations urged the Hong Kong
government to settle the VMs problem as soon as possible, noting
that the problem has become one of major unfavorable factors to
Hong Kong's smooth transition, as well as to its social order and
public security.
</P>
<P>
On Friday morning, a riot broke out in the Whitehead Detention
Center with over 7,000 VMs. During the 30-hour riot, the worst one
 of its kind in the past three years, 53 vehicles were destroyed
and a number of buildings and huts burned down in the vicinity of
the center.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen Correctional Services Department (CSD) officers were
once taken hostage and 43 police and CSD officers were
injured. 115 VMs fled the center with 84 being arrested so far.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Kai-nam, secretary-general of Democratic Alliance for
Betterment of Hong Kong, said that the VMs riot showed that the
VMs problem has become a threat to Hong Kong people's life and
their properties, and in turn, it will produce an unstable impact
on Hong Kong transition.
</P>
<P>
Rita Fan Hsu Lai-tai, member of the Preparatory Committee of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), pointed out
that the root of the VMs problem lies in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Fan, former legislative and executive councilor in charge of
the VMs problem, said that incidents in VMs detention centers
occurred one another in recent years and they tended to become
intensified.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the British Hong Kong government released a group
of VMs according to the suggestion of the Privy Council of the
United Kingdom under an excuse of no proof to judge the identity
of the VMs.
</P>
<P>
She noted that there is a loophole in the decision. She urged
the British Hong Kong government to take effective measures to
make up the loophole and to repatriate all VMs in Hong Kong to
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Ngai Shiu-kit, legislative councilor, said that the VMs problem
 has become a heavy burden to the 6 million Hong Kong people and
it has directly affected the safety of the residents.
</P>
<P>
He accused British Authorities of spending Hong Kong tax
payers' money to buy their titles of "humanity" and "benevolence."
</P>
<P>
According to Hong Kong Government Information Services, by May,
 there are about 19,000 VMs in Hong Kong's five detention
centers. Since November 1991 when the HK government started the
Orderly Repatriation Program, only 2,844 VMs have been
repatriated.
</P>
<P>
Lee Chark-tim, president of Hong Kong Federation of Trade
Unions, said that the British side should take the responsibility
to solve the VMs problem.
</P>
<P>
He called for an earlier repatriation of the VMs so as not to
leave the problem to the future HKSAR government.

<HEADLINE> Senior Leaders Hail Start of Key Poverty-Relief Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- China today launched a massive

<HEADLINE> Developing Countries Facing Serious Challenges: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Li Sizhi and Liu Yegang)
</P>
<P>
MIDRAND, SOUTH AFRICA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The negotiations for
the final document of the UNCTAD IX Conference "once again
demonstrate the fierce challenges developing countries are facing
under the backdrop of the globalization and liberalization of
world economy", said China.
</P>
<P>
At the closing meeting of the two-week Ninth Session of the
U.N. Conference On Trade And Development (UNCTAD IX) held here
today, north of JohannesburLong, deputy head of the Chinese
delegation Long Yongtu said that UNCTAD IX has made positive
achievements in adopting Midrand Declaration and the Final
Document through "tenuous negotiations", but the discussion of
the role and mandate of UNCTAD "goes far beyond those of a
multilateral institution".
</P>
<P>
A few countries are trying to diminish and even root out the
role of developing countries in multilateral trade system by
diminishing the role of UNCTAD.
</P>
<P>
Long, also assistant minister of the Chinese Foreign Trade And
Economic Cooperation, said "we are of the view that both UNCTAD
and the World Trade Organization (WTO) are component parts of the
global trading system and they should establish mutually
reinforced, mutually complementary relationship through effective
cooperation."
</P>
<P>
"UNCTAD, as the most universal international trade and
economic organization, should play its role to monitor the
implementation of multilateral regulations and establish a
relationship of check and balance with WTO," said the Chinese
minister.
</P>
<P>
"Only by establishment of such a mechanism can the
multilateral trading system safeguard the interests of all
countries on a fair and equitable basis and prevent a few
countries from dominating the multilateral system so as to ensure
its validity and vitality," said Long.
</P>
<P>
For this, Mr. Long said, "without development of Africa, there
will be no prosperity of the world economy. Without the active
participation of Africa, there will be no genuine global economic
integration."
</P>
<P>
Africa's external debt in 1995 was more than 317 billion U. S.
Dollars and 33 out of the 40 heaviest indebted countries in the
world defined by the World Bank are African countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the conclusion of UNCTAD IX in Africa will enhance the
confidence of all developing countries, including those from
Africa, to promote their economy so as to take advantage of the
opportunities derived from the accelerating process of global
trade and investment liberalization and minimize the negative
impact during this process.
</P>
<P>
Long backed Thailand for sponsoring the next UNCTAD Conference
in Bangkok, in 2000.

<HEADLINE> UK to Subsidize Fishermen for Scrapping Vessels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The British government is planning
to subsidize British fishermen if they agree to scrap their
fishing vessels to meet EU targets for a cut in fishing capacity.
</P>
<P>
The government has agreed to offer a total of 13 million pounds
(about 20 million U.S. dollars) this year if a 19-percent
reduction is achieved by year end.
</P>
<P>
Britain is facing prosecution by the European Union (EU)
Commission if it fails to do so, according to today's Financial
Times.
</P>
<P>
Britain's failure to meet the requirements will eventually
prevent its fishermen's access to EU's 1.05 billion pound (about
1.6 billion dollar) scheme for restructuring and modernizing
fleets.
</P>
<P>
The British fleet, which has been cut by 7 percent since 1992
when the EU Commission ordered compulsory reductions, still falls
far short of the EU target of 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The problem for the UK is that it has a backlog from previous
capacity cutting rounds and necessary measures have not been put
in place," an EU Commission official said.
</P>
<P>
But British fishermen complained that the problem is
exacerbated by foreign flag ships buying British licences in order
to gain access to British fish quotas.
</P>
<P>
"Other member states are exporting their over-capacity to us,"
the chief executive of the UK National Federation of Fishermen's
Organization said.
</P>
<P>
The British Ministry of Agriculture blamed on the fishermen's
success two years ago in blocking the introduction of limits on
the amount of time they could stay at sea.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry has stepped its campaign of cutting the fishing
capacity this year by offering more compensations, but it admitted
privately that it is very difficult to reach the EU target.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Draft Law On National Defense Submitted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- China is to draft a law to add
impetus to the development of its national defense, and reassure
the world of its pursuit of peace and determination to maintain
territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The draft law on national defense was submitted today for
consideration this morning in Beijing to the current session of
the Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress
(NPC), China's legislature.
</P>
<P>
Chi Haotian, minister of national defense and vice-chairman of
the Central Military Commission (CMC), was authorized by the State
Council and the CMC to explain the draft law to the country's
legislators.
</P>
<P>
"The formulation of this law is a significant step in
consolidating and strengthening the national defense, which is the
guarantee for the survival and development of the country," Chi
said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, a strong leadership and a set of policies for
the national defense with Chinese characteristics and suitable for
China's real situation have gradually evolved in the past under
the collective leadership of the Party Central Committee with the
late Chairman Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, and Jiang Zemin at the
core.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to confirm our good traditions, principles,
and policies in the construction of national defense and army in
the form of law to ensure the long-term and stable implementation
of them," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He added that such a law can clearly illustrate China's
peace-oriented principles and policies for national defense to the
rest of the world, and can help create a favorable external
environment for the country's reform and opening drive.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the national defense law should cover
not only the preparations for and resistance to any possible armed
invasions from the outside world, but also any crackdowns on any
attempts to seek independence and separate the motherland, and on
any rebellions or armed riots with the purpose of overthrowing the
socialist system.
</P>
<P>
"All these activities usually have the support of hostile forces
outside China and constitute severe threats to the country's
sovereignty, territorial integrity, and safety," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the necessity to keep on the high alert against the
activities of "Taiwan Independence" elements and other splittist
groups in the coming period.
</P>
<P>
Draft work on the proposed law on national defense started in
September 1993 and contains 13 chapters and 75 articles. It makes clear
stipulations on the Party's absolute leadership over the armed
forces, the power of relevant government organs in national
defense, national defense funds, and national defense assets.
</P>
<P>
It also covers aspects like education on national defense,
national defense mobilization, protection of the servicemen's
rights and interests, and legal responsibilities for the
violators.

<HEADLINE> Baoshan Iron and Steel Firm Leads Others in Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai-based Baoshan Iron and
Steel (Group) Company has been named as China's largest industrial
enterprise in terms of asset value.
</P>
<P>
It earned top spot following a national meeting called to
discuss state property.
</P>
<P>
A press release revealed that Baoshan is the largest Chinese
state-owned industrial firm with an asset volume of 59.8 billion
yuan (about 7.12 billion US dollars). It is followed by Liaoning
Province's Anshan Iron and Steel (Group) Company, at 48.6 billion
yuan, and Heilongjiang Province's Daqing Petroleum Management
Bureau, at 45.1 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The release also said that China's state-owned industrial
enterprises, numbering around 302,000, have 7.2873 trillion yuan
in total assets and 5.1762 trillion in combined liabilities, which
translates into an average asset-liability ratio of 71 percent.
</P>
<P>
Large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, about 15.5
percent of the total number of state-owned enterprises, account
for 82.3 percent of the total amount of assets for all state-owned
industrial firms, an analysis shows.
</P>
<P>
In another analysis, large state-owned enterprises have assets
averaged at 720 million yuan. The amount for medium-sized and
small state-owned enterprises is 85 million yuan and six million
yuan, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The press release said that increase in the combined asset size
of Chinese state-owned enterprises has accelerated. The growth
rate averaged 12.9 percent since 1949, when the People's Republic
of China was founded, and 15.5 percent since 1978, when China
embarked on a reform and opening-up drive.

Saturday to win his outdoor season-opening 100 meters with a 10.09
seconds at the Japan Grand Prix in Osaka.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian, who set a world 200 meters indoor record on

and appeared to be easing up at the finish.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell was timed in 10.16, followed by Canadian Bruny Surin
with 10.28.
</P>
<P>
Fredericks, the 28-year-old who won silver medals in both the
100m and 200m races at the Barcelona Olympics, quoted as saying
that he did not want to carry around the weight of some people's
expectations that he could go one better at Atlanta and win gold
in both the events.
</P>
<P>
He attributed his good early form to training with Britain's
sprint star Linford Christie in Australia and Florida this year.
</P>
<P>
Noureddine Morceli of Algeria World mile, 1500m and 3000m
record holder who was had an eighth-month break, ran a lack of
serious competition mile race with a winning time of 3:51.30, more
than six seconds ahead of Paul McMullen of the United States and
Abdellah Abdelhak of Morocco.
</P>
<P>
"For me today, the race was very good, it's a very good
beginning. It was the first race in eight months since I ran last
in Johanesburg," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was also his 33rd straight win in the one mile and 1,500m
races, his last defeat at the distances coming in Barcelona where
he finished seventh.
</P>
<P>
The world champion said he had still not decided what events
to compete in at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
The meet's two other world record holders, Bulgaria's high
jumper Stefka Kostadinova and the Czech Rebublic's javelin
thrower Jan Zelezny were not tested either.
</P>
<P>
Kostadinova won her event with a leap of 1.96 metres, failing
for the second meeting in a row to clear two metres.
</P>
<P>
But she forecast that she would not have to jump her world
record height of 2.09 metres to win the gold medal at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Zelezny managed to throw over 90.6m, though he was not
satisfied with his winning performance.
</P>
<P>
Mikaela Ingberg of Finland set her personal best of 65.66m to
win the women's javelin, beating Li Lei of China and Lee Young-Sun
of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Catherin McKiernan of Ireland emerged victorious in the 5,000m
in 15:07.36, while Michelle Freeman timed 12.79 to win the 100m
hurdles beating fellow Jamaican Dionne Rose and American LaVonna
Floreal.
</P>
<P>
In the 100m, Chryste Gaines finished in 11.36 to lead an
American 1-2 finish with Carlette Guidry, beating Jamaica's Juliet
Campbell and Gillian Russell.
</P>
<P>
In the men's events, Lee Jin-Taek of South Korea cleared 2.30m
to win the high jump, while Chinese Zou Sixin leapt 16.95m to win
the triple jump. Kenyan Julius Gitahi won the 5,000m in 13:29.28,
and Samuel Matete of Zambia won the 400m hurdles in 48.15.
</P>
<P>
American John godina, world shot put record holder, showed his
supremacy in the event, throwing 20.85m. Igor Astapkovich of
Belarus claimed the hammer throw with 79.36m.

</P>
<P>
Nabil Shaath, minister of planning and international
cooperation in the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) told the
Cairo-based Sawt el-Arab (the Voice of Arabs) Radio that the

<P>
The country's first draft Law on Firearms Control was tabled
with China's top legislature, the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC) for review in Beijing today
(Saturday).
</P>
<P>
The draft law proposes that the maximum penalty for a variety
of gun-related crimes could be a death sentence, for crimes
ranging from producing, buying, selling and transporting rifles
without official permission, to smuggling weapons into the country.
</P>
<P>
The number of government functionaries allowed to carry guns
will be reduced and measures in the day-to-day management and
control of firearms will increase according to law.
</P>
<P>
The stipulations are "crucial for maintaining public order and
safeguarding public security," said Mou Xinsheng, vice-minister of
public security, as he explained the draft law to lawmakers today
at a plenary meeting.
</P>
<P>
China's "gun plague" was mainly caused by people who are
"driven by economic interests, rampantly engaging themselves in
illegal production and selling of guns," Mou said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some weapon research and manufacturing units have
violated government regulations and rules to illegally produce,
distribute and sell guns, allowing a large number of weapons to
flood into the society, he said.
</P>
<P>
The increasing number of smuggling and arms trafficking cases
in China's southwestern border areas has also attributed to the
rise of firearms in the country, according to the vice-minister.
</P>
<P>
Those weapons have been used by armed gangs of criminals, and
people have started to use guns in civil rows, a problem difficult
for the police to stop, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The widespread distribution of guns in society is also harmful
to the protection of the country's wildlife," Mou told legislators.
</P>
<P>
The majority of countries in the world take tighter control of
guns, with countries that once allowed freer ownership of weapons
now adopting stricter measures to control firearms, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The draft specifies that the state will implement special
permission and quotas systems for firearm production, distribution
and sales, and guns without legal numbering, or guns with copycat
numbers, or false numbers shall be strictly outlawed.
</P>
<P>
The public security departments will periodically conduct
inspections of enterprises and units producing, distributing and
selling guns. If necessary official state supervisors will be
posted on duty at the enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Rifles for civil use and gun licences shall be examined
annually, it says. Rules on storing and transporting guns, as well
as transportation of firearms across borders will also come under
the proposed new gunlaw.
</P>
<P>
The firearms used by the army, armed police and militia will
also be controlled in strict accordance with relevant rules issued
by the State Council and the Central Military Commission, the
draft says.

<HEADLINE> China to Revise Rules on Selling, Transferring of Archives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- China is revising its
eight-year-old Archives Law to change the rules on selling and
giving away personal or collectively-owned archives. The transfer
of state-owned archives will also come under new rules.
</P>
<P>
The draft amendment to the Archives Law was submitted for
examination in Beijing today to the National People's Congress
(NPC) Standing Committee, the top legislative body.
</P>
<P>
Director of the State Achieves Bureau Wang Gang explained the
draft law to the on-going 19th plenary session of the
committee. He said that the existing law is too vague and unclear
about the selling and transferring of archives.
</P>
<P>
The revision is expected to protect the completeness of China's
archives and also protect the rights of owners of archives.
</P>
<P>
The existing law lays down that "individuals or collective
owners of valuable archives may deposit or sell files to relevant
state archives, reselling archives at a profit is strictly
prohibited, and selling archives to foreigners is strictly
prohibited."
</P>
<P>
But it does not stipulate whether files of no preservation
value, or declined by state archives, could be sold or given
away. Nor does it make clear whether Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan
compatriots are allowed to buy them.
</P>
<P>
The draft law states that "selling or giving away archives to
units or individuals other than state-owned archives, museums,
libraries or memorial halls is not allowed without permission of
governmental archives bureaux".
</P>
<P>
The new version could serve to protect both the interests of
the state and owners of archives, and prevent disputes in this
field from arising, said Wang Gang.
</P>
<P>
The existing law maintains that "selling state-owned archives
is forbidden," but does not say whether they could be transferred.
</P>
<P>
And with more and more state-owned enterprises changing their
nature of ownership, or merging, or even going bankrupt, their
historical files should also be transferred.
</P>
<P>
The draft law adds that such transfer should be ratified by
governmental archives bureaux.
</P>
<P>
The draft law makes it illegal to steal state archives, and
spells out relevant stipulations for punishing such activity.
</P>
<P>
There are 3,589 archives of various kinds stored in China,
containing 160 million files, 360,000 audio discs, video and film
files, and 9.45 million photos.
</P>
<P>
They provide valuable proof of China's history and important
data for economic development, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
For instance, many archives were used to prove the feasibility
of China's Three Gorges Project before it was started.

<HEADLINE> UNCTAD Pledges To Promote Sustainable Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Ye Xingzeng and Li Sizhi)
</P>
<P>
Midrand, South Africa, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
conference on trade and development (UNCTAD) today pledged to
promote the sustainable development for its member states,
particularly the developing countries, in a globalizing and
liberalizing world economy.
</P>
<P>
The commitment was made in "the final document" adopted by the
ninth session of UNCTAD, which ended this morning in Midrand
north of Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD, as an international organization having a clear
comparative advantage in tackling trade-related development
issues, should continue to facilitate the integration of
developing countries into the globalizing and liberalizing world
trading system, said the document.
</P>
<P>
It stated that UNCTAD's work should be geared to the special
needs of developing countries, particularly the least developed
countries, and focus on development issues, such as sustainable
development, poverty alleviation and cooperation among developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
In this respect, UNCTAD pledged to provide a forum for
discussions aimed at considering development strategies and
policies in a globalized world economy.

<HEADLINE> China To Evaluate Collectively-Owned Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- China is to appraise the assets of
its urban collectively-owned enterprises, starting this year, the
State Council has decided.
</P>
<P>
The decision, which comes immediately after China has completed
its work to appraise the assets of its state-owned enterprises, is
described as a fresh move by the Chinese government to consolidate
the foundation of the public economic sector.
</P>
<P>
The up-coming appraisal will cover all collectively-owned
enterprises, including joint economic organizations and relevant
departments and institutions.
</P>
<P>
The appraisal is designed to enable the authorities to have a
complete knowledge about the distribution, amounts, structure and
performance of the assets in collectively-owned enterprises. It
will help promote the development of the collectively-owned
sector, according to the decision.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Ministry of Finance, the State Economic and
Trade Commission and the State Administration of Taxation, the
appraisal will be carried out by grass-root units of the three
government departments.
</P>
<P>
Experimental evaluation will first be conducted this year in
selected areas and economic sectors as well as enterprises
affiliated with supplying and marketing cooperatives and credit
cooperatives, according to the decision. The State Council, the
Ministry of Finance and other government departments will soon
issue a circular detailing rules governing the appraising work.
</P>
<P>
China has just concluded a four-year endeavor to evaluate the
assets in state-owned enterprises, which currently number
302,000. The result shows that the enterprises have a total of
7.2873 trillion yuan (about 867.5 billion US dollars) in assets
and 5.1762 trillion yuan in liabilities.

<HEADLINE> Kazakh President Visits Iran for Rail Ceremony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev arrived here today for a grand inauguration ceremony
of a railway which links the landlocked Central Asian states with
the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
A number of Kazakh senior officials, including Deputy Prime
Ministers and ministers of foreign affairs, oil, and transport,
are accompanying Nazarbayev and are expected to discuss bilateral
issues with their Iranian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
In a brief talk with Iran's First Vice-President Hassan
Habibi, Nazarbayev called for further promotion of Tehran-Alma Ata
relations.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on friendly ties between the two republics, the
Kazakh president expressed hope that various agreements on
different fields, particularly those related to oil, will be
reached.
</P>
<P>
Expressing satisfaction over the visit of the Kazakh delegation
to Iran, Habibi stated that the two sides will finalize agreements
on different issues that have been previously discussed.
</P>
<P>
The Mashhad-Sarakhs-Tajan railroad will be officially
inaugurated on May 13, which is regarded as a landmark in the
history of Asia.
</P>
<P>
It will not only boost regional trade but also facilitate
bilateral and multilateral cultural exchanges among regional
countries.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first stage in constructing an Asian railway
system, with the rail connections providing overland access
between Europe and China, as well as cutting travel time for
people and goods.
</P>
<P>
Aside from linking the Central Asian Republics to world
markets via ports in the Persian Gulf, the Mediterranean and the
Black Sea, the railway will also lead to further cultural
exchanges among regional countries.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian press hold that cultural exchanges are more
important than commercial deals for they enhance understanding
among nations ... (which) in turn provides for tolerance and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Today's English daily Kayhan International said in its
editorial that the massive railway project has attracted
international attention and will have a significant impact on the
whole process of economic development in the region.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the figures provided by local officials, the
editorial said the Sarakhs customs office, established in 1995,
would be converted into a general office to handle 30,000 tons of
cargo per day from the present 5,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The volume of commodities to be transported would increase to
4 million tons in mid-1997, it added.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that the economic benefits of this project
would "certainly provide political leverage to the Islamic
establishment in Iran."
</P>
<P>
With the completion of the 600-kilometer project and that of
the 921-kilometer strategic Bafq-Mashhad railroad, along with the
interim operations of the international airport in Sarakhs, the
new economic order will play an important role in Iran's post-
construction process with a tendency toward substituting oil
revenues with other sources of income, concluded the daily.

<HEADLINE> UNCTAD IX Stresses Partnership For Development: Declaration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MIDRAND, South Africa, May 11 (Xinhua) -- UNCTAD ix today
stressed the need for a new approach to assisting development and
translating the "Spirit of Cartagena" reached in Colombia four
years ago into reality.
</P>
<P>
This was declared here by delegates from 188 members of the
Ninth Session of the UN Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD ix) in "Midrand Declaration" and the final document
calleld "a partnership for growth and development" adopted
unanimously at the closing meeting.
</P>
<P>
The declaration summed up the situation after the Uruguay
round, saying increased interdependence is a powerful impetus to
liberalization. It added, "competitive pressure on all economies
has increased, and market forces play a pivotal role."
</P>
<P>
"However, we must recognize that countries enter this system
from very different starting points. Accordingly, the impact of
globalization and liberalization is uneven," it said, noting that
too many people continue to live in dire poverty and "this is an
intolerable situation."
</P>
<P>
The final document is designed to explain in detail the
meaning of the declaration, a reliable source from the Chinese
delegation who attended the meeting from beginning to end told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The partnership for development must be based on a clear
defination of roles, the establishment of common objectives and
development of joint action, said the declaration.
</P>
<P>
It said this means strengthening cooperation between developed
and developing countries, enhancing cooperation between
developing nations with special attention to the least developed
countries (LDCS) and carrying out more effective coordination and
complementarity of multilateral institutions.
</P>
<P>
This also means mobilizing human and material resources toward
development through dialogue and common action between
governments and the civil society and fostering partnership
between the public and private sector to achieve higher growth
rates and greater development.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD must "offer support appropriate to the needs of
developing countries to ensure that they participate in the world
economy on a more equitable basis" and "its policy research and
analytical work must illuminate the changes in the global economy
as they relate to trade, investment, technology, services and
development," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It urged UNCTAD to step up cooperation and coordination with
the WTO and other multilateral institutions in enhancing
technical assistance to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD must carry out reform designed to refocus and
reinvigorate international cooperation for peace and development,
it said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, UNCTAD adopted a resolution, agreeing to slim down
to three commissions from seven, according to a proposal by a
member state, a UNCTAD spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The three commissions would focus on trade and commodities,
investment and technology, and business facilitation and
development, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The declaration called on the current UNCTAD president to
convene a special high-level review meeting two years prior to
UNCTAD x to build on the political commitment of its members and
ensure its implementation.
</P>
<P>
South Africa will host a workshop in Africa, requesting the
Asian and Latin American groups to share their experience in
fostering partnership between the public and private sectors in
mobilizing resources for development, it said.
</P>
<P>
"The focus will be on the role of this partnership for ldcs
and how other developing countries can work together with ldcs,"
said the declaration.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the session agreed to hold UNCTAD x in
Thailand four years later.
</P>
<P>
It was not easy for the delegates to spend two whole weeks to
reach agreements on the declaration and the final document, the
source said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Correction: Roundup: Who Benefits From Uruguay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 11 (Xinhua) -- As the globalization and
liberalization process accelerates after the final acts of the
Uruguay round were signed in 1994, people wonder who have
benefited from them and how to alleviate their adverse impact.
</P>
<P>
Governments in the developing countries have to incorporate
the implications of globalization in their policies, companies
have to cope with it to survive or to thrive and the public in
many countries is most anxious that it may negatively affect
values.
</P>
<P>
In a word, many countries and people are worried about the
negative economic effects on the developing countries, especially
the least developed countries (LDCS) after the Uruguay round
created the World Trade Organization (WTO), strengthening the
rules-based trading system.
</P>
<P>
 Who is main loser?
</P>
<P>
There are gainers and losers in the process. The fear is that
globalization will widen the gap between the strong and weak, and
the have and have-nots in the world.
</P>
<P>
Commerce, Trade and Tourism Minister of Zambia Alfeyo Hambayi
said, "given the structural weakness of our economies we will not
be able in the short and medium term, to take advantage of these
challenges and opportunities offered by the Uruguay round."
</P>
<P>
He said at the ninth session of the UN Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) in Midrand that supply-side constraints
impede the smooth flow of foreign direct investment (FDI) and
"prevent us from making maximum use of the opportunities created
by the round."
</P>
<P>
"Without an effective and sustainable solution to these
problems, the stated goal of the international trading system and
the global economy would only be realized at the expense of many
developing countries who would be marginalized and left in
poverty and under-development," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Under the pounding of the cheap goods from Asian nations and
the second-hand garments from the US and Europe, the output of
Tanzania's fabric dropped from 40 million square meters in 1993
to 17.5 million in 1994, and 12 out of the 15 state-owned textile
mills had to close that year.
</P>
<P>
Zambia also closed 18 textile mills that year and three of
Kenya's were forced to shut down during the period.
</P>
<P>
Ghana is classified as a model by the International Monetary
Fund and the West in practising structure adjustment reforms and
she has made some gains in economic growth in recent years, but
this west African country also complained about globalization and
liberalization brought about by the Uruguay round agreements.
</P>
<P>
Ghanaian Minister of Trade and Industry Dan Abodakpi said,
"trade liberalization has proved to be a two-edged sword for the
private sector, the benefits of improved access to imported
materials being heavily eroded by the rapid growth in imports of
finished products against which our manufacturers have found it
difficult to compete."
</P>
<P>
Countries must respond to the changes brought about by the
round and the challenges they pose for development. A minister
from Mauritius said being a small island developing country,
Mauritius "is not in a position to easily integrate into the
world economy and tap emerging opportunities."
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Minister Issac Areola said, "most developing
countries are still languishing in abject poverty due largely to
lack of market access, absence of investment, price instability,
debt burden, currency fluctuation, poor and inefficient
infrastructure and services."
</P>
<P>
He said, "the Uruguay round will, in the short term, not
benefit most African countries. Furthermore, the implementation
of the Uruguay round agreement will put a heavy burden on some
developing countries, especially the LDCS and the net-food
importing countries."
</P>
<P>
"Studies suggest that the loss would arise from various
sources including erosion of trade preferences from which they
currently benefit under the Lome Convention, generalized system
of preferences (GSP) and other preferential arrangements," Areola
said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, "the agreement will also impose significant
transitional costs on developing countries, especially in Africa.
Indeed, Africa appears to be the main loser in the Uruguay
round."

<TEXT>
<P>
CANNES, FRANCE, May 10 (Xinhua) -- China Film, the biggest film
exporter in China, took advantage of the prestigious Cannes Film
Festival, which opened Thursday on a rain-soaked French Riviera,
to promote the still veiled Chinese films in the world market.
</P>
<P>
As the only seller from China that has a stand at the Cannes
film market, the China Film Export and Import Cooperation (China
Film) brought with it 30 films for screening at the market, Wu
Mengchen, president of China Film, told a press conference held
here today.
</P>
<P>
Wu stated that since the late 1980s, Chinese films have walked
away with many awards at world-famous filmfests such as the
Cannes, Berlin and Venice film festivals.
</P>
<P>
However, few Chinese films have been screened in mainstream
theaters in other countries, where film-goers still feel strange
about the Chinese cinema, Wu admitted.
</P>
<P>
To secure a successful promotion of Chinese films at Cannes,
his company had held the first Beijing Screenings in Beijing last
April, which attracted some 61 buyers from 16 countries, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Beijing Screenings will be held annually
ahead of the Cannes festival to bridge the Chinese films and
foreign buyers.

<HEADLINE> Three Draft Laws Submitted to Legislators for Consideration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Three draft laws today were
submitted for consideration, to the plenum of the 19th session of
the Standing Committee of the 8th National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Wang Gang, director of the State Archives Bureau, Chi Haotian,
vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, State Councillor
and minister of national defense, and Mou Xinsheng, vice-minister
of public security, respectively made explanations on the three
draft laws.
</P>
<P>
The draft amendment to the Archives Law made additions to the
existing law on the sale, donation, and transfer of archives, in
a bid to safeguard national interests, protect collective and
private ownerships of archives, and avoid unnecessary disputes in
archives management.
</P>
<P>
It stipulated that any transfer of archives of state-owned
enterprises caused by the change of the enterprise's ownership
must get government approval.
</P>
<P>
In his explanation on the draft law on national defense, Chi
Haotian called the formulation of the law a "significant step" in
consolidating and strengthening the national defense which, he
said, is the guarantee for the country's survival and development.
</P>
<P>
He added that the law reflected the peace-oriented principles
and policies of China's national defense and was to help create a
favorable external environment for the reform and opening-up drive.
</P>
<P>
The draft law on firearms control stipulated that anyone who
makes, purchases, or traffics guns without government permission
or smuggles guns into the country can face a maximum penalty of
death.
</P>
<P>
The draft law also narrowed down the scope for government
functionaries to carry guns and imposed stricter supervision
on owners of firearms.
</P>
<P>
Also on today's plenum, vice-foreign minister Li Zhaoxing made
an explanation on the United Nations Convention On The Law of The
Sea and asked the legislators to approve China's ratification of it.
</P>
<P>
Legislators also heard three written reports, respectively on
the visit of Qiao Shi, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, to
Ukraine, Russia, Greece, Cuba, and Canada, the visit of the NPC
delegation to Ireland, Belgium, and Iceland, and the attendance of
the NPC delegation of the 95th session of the Inter-Parliamentary
Union.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi attended today's plenary meeting, which was presided
over by Chen Muhua, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee.

<P>
Last night, three major parties, the former ruling Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP), the former largest opposition Awami
(People's) League (AL) and the Jatiya (National) Party (JP) led by
H.M. Ershad, the jailed ex-president of the country, announced
their respective lists of candidates to contest the 300
parliamentary seats in the poll race.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, some other smaller parties including the
Jamaat-e-Islami, left democratic front and the Islamic
Constitution Movement had already named their candidates.
</P>
<P>
Recently, politicians across the country have converged in
Dhaka to lobby with their respective party high command to set the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
Beginning from last Saturday, a total of 1,485 nomination
seekers from the AL and 1,122 aspiring candidates from the BNP
have been interviewed by the parties' parliamentary board.
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve their target which, obviously, is power,
many politicians, especially the noted personages, have tried hard
to get an entry to a party from which they can gain more. Some of
them even have not hesitated to betray the original party for a
new party's patronage. The transfers look like auctions and are
full of surprises.
</P>
<P>
JP leader-turned-BNP politician Mahbubur Rahman, who has fought
a fierce legal battle for the release of JP leader Ershad, left
the job all on a sudden glowing in the warmth of the opposite camp
the next morning.
</P>
<P>
The retired immediate past chief of army staff Lieutenant
General M. Nooruddin Khan joined the AL simply because the BNP
refused to sacrifice its former MP for Nooruddin for a
constituency.
</P>
<P>
Although the formal campaign has yet been kicked out, leaders
of various parties and the intending candidates have already
embarked on their campaign through holding rallies and
mass-contact programs in respective constituencies.
</P>
<P>
All engaged in the battle appear to be winners. But the
triumph is evident in the rival smiles flashed by AL Chief Shiekh
Hasina and BNP chairperson and ex-prime minister Begum Khaleda
Zia, which the voters see every morning on newspaper front pages.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, it is hard to answer the question that who will
win the June 12 polls, but AL-BNP close fight in most of the 300
constituencies has been certain.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the party's election manifesto Friday, the AL chief
pledged to build Bangladesh a modern state free from hunger and
poverty, terrorism and corruption.
</P>
<P>
The AL has blamed the BNP for corruption during its rule in the
past years and taken the issue as one of the powerful weapons
against the BNP during the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, BNP chief Khaleda began her election campaign
formally today through holding public meetings and
mass-campaigning in different places of the country's largest port
city of Chittagong.
</P>
<P>
The party's election manifesto will soon be announced within a
day or two.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the caretaker government has assisted the
Election Commission (EC) to get everything ready for holding the
national polls in a free, fair and congenial atmosphere
</P>
<P>
The code of conduct was announced last Saturday while pre-polls
irregularities probe bodies were formed across the country on May
8, providing do's and don'ts for candidates.
</P>
<P>
Chief adviser to the caretaker government M. Habibur Rahman
Thursday pledged that it was decided to deploy armed forces in the
polls in aid of the civil administration to maintain law and order
to ensure holding the elections in a peaceful atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming elections are only one month away in Bangladesh
and preparations by various political parties and the authorities
are going on in full swing. Observers here said that the high tide
of polls contention is reaching.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Tries to Resolve Intern Placement Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga Friday wrote to Health Minister M. Fowzie asking him
to direct his ministry to place 10 medical graduates who have been
questioned on being given precedence in the appointments over
locally qualified doctors.
</P>
<P>
The placement for the 10 interns who obtained their
qualifications in Cuba and the effective date for their
appointments caused the current para-medical personnel strike
which entered the ninth day today, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The president has also informed Fowzie that the effective
appointment date of the interns will be decided by the cabinet
with due regard to the minister's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
Fowzie had recommended that the date should be backdated to
April 26, when all the graduates completed their internships in
government hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The Government Medical Officers' Association has led the
current strike of more than 3,700 medical officers in about 300
government hospitals since April 27.
</P>
<P>
According to the association sources, all post interns should
be given employment on April 26 no matter where they got their
qualifications.
</P>
<P>
However, the Health Minister emphasized that such appointments
should be approved by the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
But the strike organizers declined to accept this stance at the
end of last month, saying that the approval was not necessary
according to the past practice and the appointments should be
given on a fair basis.
</P>
<P>
Most of the post interns feared that if they end the strike,
the government would change its mind about the appointments in
excuse of the cabinet approval though the authorities had actually
promised to give all the appointments on an equal footing, the
sources said.

<HEADLINE> Greek Warplanes Take Part in War Games in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Greek warplanes have taken part in
an unannounced joint air and sea military exercise with the
Cyprus armed forces -- National Guard.
</P>
<P>
According to the local press today, around 30 Greek Air Force
F16 and A7 Corsair fighters Friday took part in the maneuver
held within the framework of the joint defense dogma, the
military pact concluded between Cyprus and Greece in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Defense Minister Costas Eliades has confirmed that the
Greek aircraft which fly over the island's airspace are part of
the implementation of the Greco-Cypriot joint defense pact.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the flights over Cyprus were part of
the aero-nautical exercise, code-named "Toxotis" (Archer), and
were being held in cooperation with Cypriot forces.
</P>
<P>
The Greek planes carried out maneuvers over Larnaca and
Paphos international airports, which also involved live firing on
mock targets.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' National Guard has no combat aircraft apart from a
half-dozen anti-tank helicopters.
</P>
<P>
The exercise was held less than 24 hours after President
Glafcos Clerides returned from a five-day visit to Athens which
included a meeting with Greek Defense Minister Gerasimos Arsenis.
</P>
<P>
According to Eliades, the exercise, began Friday, will be
completed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Greece, Turkey and Britain are guarantors of the island's
independence under the 1960 treaty of establishment of the Cyprus
Republic.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO allies, are at odds over this
east Mediterranean strategic island, which has been divided since
the Turkish invasion in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Athens has warned Ankara that any further advance of the
Turkish troops toward the government-controlled southern part of
the island would mean war between the two countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Saint Anton, Austria, won a
close bid Saturday to host the 2001 world alpine ski championships.
</P>
<P>
Close to 50 ecstatic Austrians were in an uproar at the 40th
International Ski Federation (FIS) Congress in Christchurch, New
Zealand when president Marc Hodler announced the results of a
third and final ballot.
</P>
<P>
Saint Anton took 64 votes of a possible 116 on the third
ballot, followed by Saint Moritz, Switzerland with 52.
</P>
<P>
Lillehammer, Norway, site of the last Olympic Winter Games,
dropped off after the first ballot, and Bormio, Italy, after the
second one, with Saint Anton holding a narrow lead all the way.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 2001 world nordic championships will be held in
Scandinavia.
</P>
<P>
Three ballots were also required before Lahti, Finland, won the
vote for the nordic event, ahead of Val di Fiemme, Italy,
Oberstdorf, Germany, and Sapporo, Japan.
</P>
<P>
It will be the third time the world nordic championships will
come to Lahti, the last being in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Meiringen-Hasliberg in Switzerland won the bid for the
1999 world freestyle ski championships, with 68 votes to the 48
of Hundfjallet in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Meiringen-Hasliberg has been the site for three World Cup
finals since 1988, but the world championships have never
previously been held in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 world skiflying championships went to Oberstdorf, the
only candidate.
</P>
<P>
Hodler was re-elected president of the FIS. Now 77, he has held
the post since 1951.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Who Benefits From Uruguay Round? (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 11 (Xinhua) -- How to reduce the loss?
"Concessions on tariff and non-tariff measures on products of
interest to the poorest countries ought to be implemented
immediately. Further improvements to the GSP schemes for products
of particular interest to the developing countries, especially
for poorest countries are necessary," Zambian Minister Hambayi
said.
</P>
<P>
In this connection, Ghanaian Minister Abodakpi said his
delegation "urges the international community to support the
common fund for commodities and provide it with adequate
resources."
</P>
<P>
The Uruguay round, despite its sweeping and legally binding
provisions, has not, to date at least, caused some major trading
powers to abandon their protectionist habits which in truth cost
the international trading community enormously, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
The fund, founded in Nairobi in 1976 as a key instrument to
attain the agreed objectives of the integrated program for
commodities, has a partnership of 103 nations which are joining
forces to advance economically the most needy countries.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992 when the second account of the fund was
operational, 39 commodity development projects have been approved
which benefit over 100 countries with 87 million US Dollars,
mostly in the form of grants.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Minister Areola urged timely measures be taken to
assist developing countries to increase their competitiveness in
the world market.
</P>
<P>
"There is the urgent need to implement the Marrakesh
ministerial decision on LDCS and net-food importing countries.
These should include financial and technical assistance, export
credits, the development of transport and communication
infrastructures," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Right through the 1980s," he complained, "commodity prices
fell on the average by around 5 percent annually, in real terms.
By 1990, they had further fallen by 45 percent below their 1980
level."
</P>
<P>
In 1992 UNCTAD VIII heralded the spirit of Cartagena, a new
partnership for development. This partnership for development
must be given real meaning.
</P>
<P>
Vijay Makhan, Assistant Secretary-general of the Organization
for African Unity said as the world moves toward economic
liberalization and globalization, "there looms a threat of
marginalization of millions of people on the planet", especially
those in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He urged the donor community "to contribute to the African
commodities diversification fund in accordance with the UN
Assembly Resolution 49/142."
</P>
<P>
"Africa's foreign debts totaled 317 billion U.S. Dollars in
1994, and this corresponds to an average of 231.3 percent of
Africa's exports of goods and 71.6 percent of the total GDP of
the continent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Makhan went on to say the flows of foreign direct investment
(FDI) to Africa decreased as a proportion of the developing
countries' total FDI from 10 percent in 1987/1911 to about 5
percent in 1992/1994.
</P>
<P>
Unless the debt problem of Africa is adequately resolved and
the FDI increased, they "will continue to impede our continent's
development," said the OAU official.
</P>
<P>
As the Uruguay round acts put all the rivals on a par with
each other, the developing countries are no match for the
developed nations during the globalization process, and some
would even be marginalized.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD is placed to fulfill the role of supporting the weak and
ensure that developing countries are afforded opportunities to
participate in the world economy on a more equitable basis.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD should persuade the developed nations to refrain from
practising protectionist measures such as anti-dumping and from
making use of environment and labor standards to impede the
implementation of the Uruguay round by the developing countries,
specialists said.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on CPO, Rubber Markets in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Crude palm oil (CPO), rubber
and tin markets in Malaysia ended the week mixed with CPO and
rubber prices higher while the tin price lower.
</P>
<P>
The crude palm oil physical market closed the week higher
because of improved interest from overseas buyers. Interest from
India and Pakistan helped the price to lift to its high of 1,312.5
Malaysian Ringgit (about 525 US dollars) per ton Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The price for May South closed the week 10 Ringgit higher at
1,310 Ringgit (about 524 dollars) per ton against 1,300 Ringgit
(about 520 dollars) per ton on May 3.
</P>
<P>
The local rubber market ended the week higher because of rains
and tightened production in the country's main rubber production
areas.
</P>
<P>
RSS1 opened lower Monday at 355.5 sen (about 1.42 dollars) per
kg, but it ended on a higher note and closed at 369.5 sen (about
1.48 dollars) per kg Friday.
</P>
<P>
SMR20 finished the week 7.5 sen higher at 327.5 sen (about 1.31
dollars) per kg.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) closed the week lower
as the weaker note on the London Metal Exchange (LME) dampened
local market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
Tin price at the KLTM finished five sen lower this week to
16.03 Malaysian Ringgit (about 6.41 dollars) per kg compared with
last week's closing.
</P>
<P>
Total turnover stood at 458 tons against 251 tons on a
three-day trading week previously, with local, Japanese and
European buyers taking a major portion of the transactions.
</P>
<P>
The KLTM's premium over the LME this week widened to 60 dollars
per ton from 55 dollars last week.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Who Benefits From Uruguay Round? (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- As the globalization and
liberalization process accelerates after the final acts of the
Uruguay round were signed in 1994, people wonder who have
benefited from them and how to alleviate their adverse impact.
</P>
<P>
Governments in the developing countries have to incorporate
the implications of globalization in their policies, companies
have to cope with it to survive or to thrive and the public in
many countries is most anxious that it may negatively affect
values.
</P>
<P>
In a word, many countries and people are worried about the
negative economic effects on the developing countries, especially
the least developed countries (LDCS) after the Uruguay round
created the World Trade Organization (WTO), strengthening the
rules-based trading system.
</P>
<P>
 Who is main loser?
</P>
<P>
There are gainers and losers in the process. The fear is that
globalization will widen the gap between the strong and weak, and
the have and have-nots in the world.
</P>
<P>
Commerce, Trade and Tourism Minister of Zambia Alfeyo Hambayi
said, "given the structural weakness of our economies we will not
be able in the short and medium term, to take advantage of these
challenges and opportunities offered by the Uruguay round."
</P>
<P>
He said at the ninth session of the UN Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) in Midrand that supply-side constraints
impede the smooth flow of foreign direct investment (FDI) and
"prevent us from making maximum use of the opportunities created
by the round."
</P>
<P>
"Without an effective and sustainable solution to these
problems, the stated goal of the international trading system and
the global economy would only be realized at the expense of many
developing countries who would be marginalized and left in
poverty and under-development," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Under the pounding of the cheap goods from Asian nations and
the second-hand garments from the US and Europe, the output of
Tanzania's fabric dropped from 40 million square meters in 1993
to 17.5 million in 1994, and 12 out of the 15 state-owned textile
mills had to close that year.
</P>
<P>
Zambia also closed 18 textile mills that year and three of
Kenya's were forced to shut down during the period.
</P>
<P>
Ghana is classified as a model by the International Monetary
Fund and the West in practising structure adjustment reforms and
she has made some gains in economic growth in recent years, but
this west African country also complained about globalization and
liberalization brought about by the Uruguay round agreements.
</P>
<P>
Ghanaian Minister of Trade and Industry Dan Abodakpi said,
"trade liberalization has proved to be a two-edged sword for the
private sector, the benefits of improved access to imported
materials being heavily eroded by the rapid growth in imports of
finished products against which our manufacturers have found it
difficult to compete."
</P>
<P>
Countries must respond to the changes brought about by the
round and the challenges they pose for development. A minister
from Mauritius said being a small island developing country,
Mauritius "is not in a position to easily integrate into the
world economy and tap emerging opportunities."
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Minister Issac Areola said, "most developing
countries are still languishing in abject poverty due largely to
lack of market access, absence of investment, price instability,
debt burden, currency fluctuation, poor and inefficient
infrastructure and services."
</P>
<P>
He said, "the Uruguay round will, in the short term, not
benefit most African countries. Furthermore, the implementation
of the Uruguay round agreement will put a heavy burden on some
developing countries, especially the LDCS and the net-food
importing countries."
</P>
<P>
"Studies suggest that the loss would arise from various
sources including erosion of trade preferences from which they
currently benefit under the Lome Convention, generalized system
of preferences (GSP) and other preferential arrangements," Areola
said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, "the agreement will also impose significant
transitional costs on developing countries, especially in Africa.
Indeed, Africa appears to be the main loser in the Uruguay
round."

<HEADLINE> Child Mortality Rate Reduced in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Official statistics show that the
mortality rate in Vietnam was reduced to 4.4 per cent among
infants and nearly 1.1 per cent among children in 1994 from 5.5
and 2.9 per cent, respectively, in the 1979-1983 period.
</P>
<P>
This comes in a report of the general statistics office with
assistance from the united nations' population fund.
</P>
<P>
The report says that the reduction of mortality rate among
infants and children in recent years is attributed to the
governemnt's attention to child healthcare work.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 per cent of children were immunized against the
six child killer diseases in four successive years, and a number
of infectious diseases that cause high mortality among children
are being eliminated from the community's life.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, short birth intervals lead to poor child
survival, especially in the first month of life, and that maternal
education is a factor that has strong and consistent effects on
child survival.
</P>
<P>
Data from the survey also reveal that 95 per cent of Vietnamese
infants are breast-fed up to 14 months in urban areas and 19
months in rural areas.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Backs Co-hosting Idea for 2002 World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, South Korea, May 11 (Xinhua) -- World soccer governing
body FIFA asked for the first time South Korea and Japan if they
are willing to co-host the 2002 World Cup finals, South Korean
soccer officials said here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Although soccer officials in Europe and Asia are said to be
backing the co-hosting idea, top FIFA officials, including
president Joao Havelange, had previously rejected the
unprecedented proposal.
</P>
<P>
FIFA Secretary General Sepp Blatter sent a letter dated May 7
to Japan and South Korea giving five days to respond to whether
they are willing to co-host the quadrennial soccer championship.
</P>
<P>
"Related officials are discussing a response. As a FIFA member
country, we will honor whatever FIFA decides," an official said on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The remark was in line with South Korea's recent position that
it will continue to campaign vigorously to become the sole host,
but that is willing to share the World Cup tournament with Japan
if that's what FIFA wants.
</P>
<P>
But on Friday, Chung Mong-joon, South Korea's top soccer
official, said South Korea was confident of winning the bid
against Japan and told Blatter that it will "adhere to FIFA
statutes" that do not permit dual bids for the prestigious event.
</P>
<P>
Chung said South Korea was backed as host by all of the 21 FIFA
Executive Committee members "except for three or four pro-Japanese
figures." The committee members are scheduled to meet June 1 to
make their choice.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese bid committee has rejected all previous co-hosting
suggestions.

57,500 from Singapore, which together accounted for nearly half
the province's overseas tourists.
</P>
<P>
The province also welcomed hundreds of thousands of visitors
from neighboring Myanmar, Viet Nam, and Laos.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months of this year, the province had more
than 78,000 tourists from Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Last year, over 27,000 people from Yunnan went to Southeast
Asian countries, mostly to Thailand, where costs are relatively
low, provincial tourist officials said.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months of the year, more than 11,800
passports were issued to persons in the province to travel to
Southeast Asian countries, and the figure for this year is
expected to top 30,000.
</P>
<P>
To help the tourism, airports have been opened in major tourist
cities in the province, such as the provincial capital of Kunming,
Lijiang, Jinghong, Dali, Mengshi, Baoshan, Simao and Zhaotong. Air
routes now link Kunming with Bangkok, Rangoon, and Vientiane.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the year, charter flight services started
between Jinghong, capital city of Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous
Prefecture, and Bangkok.

<HEADLINE> All Grilled Thai Cabinet Members win Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the three-day no-confidence debate, which began
Wednesday, the opposition accused Suchart of grabbing massive
areas of land with money acquired through shady deals.
</P>
<P>
Suchart was said to have exerted influence on the Bangkok Bank
of Commerce (BBC) to secure loans to buy the parcels of land.
</P>
<P>
The land was in turn put up as collateral to secure further
loans from the BBC to take over ailing listed companies.
</P>
<P>
In the course, Suchart and his associates made a lot of money
but other people suffered big losses in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
The Palang Dharma Party believed that the public did not
believe Suchart's explanation in Parliament in defense of himself.
</P>
<P>
The party fears that it may lose the public's confidence if it
does not show any discontent with the scandal-ridden Deputy
Interior Minister.
</P>
<P>
Palang Dharma is the third largest coalition government party,
holding 23 seats in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day debate, the opposition launched attacks on
seven of their planned targets.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Banharn in his capacity as Interior Minister,
Deputy Finance Minister Newin Chidchob, and Commerce Minister
Chucheep Harnsawasdi, escaped grilling because of time limit.
</P>
<P>
During the voting this morning on the three, all 159 opposition
MPs, except opposition Leader Chuan Leekpai, walked out of the
chamber to protest the no-grilling of the three.
</P>
<P>
Banharn, as the Interior Minister, won confidence of 230 MPs,
with no objection; Chuan Leekpai abstained.

<HEADLINE> China To Take Firm Action Against IPR Breaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- China's copyright authorities will
continue to take stern action against infringements of
intellectual property rights (IPR) according to national IPR laws
and international agreements, today's China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
The paper quotes an official with the National Copyright
Administration (NCA) as saying that the crackdown on piracy is
aimed at guaranteeing the healthy development of the publication
work in the country and at protecting the culture of the Chinese
nation.
</P>
<P>
Wang Huapeng made the remarks to refute US allegations that the
Chinese government had done little in implementing the Sino-US IPR
Protection Agreement signed in February of last year.
</P>
<P>
NCA figures show copyright administrative departments
nationwide unearthed more than 550 copyright infringement cases
last year, confiscating over 1.8 million pirated books and audio
and video products.
</P>
<P>
Seven CD plants in Guangdong, Hainan and Jiangsu provinces were
closed during NCA inspections, and their licenses revoked for
producing pirated and pornographic CDs, the paper reports.
</P>
<P>
The NCA and the State Press and Publication Administration have
jointly asked CD plants to print "source identification data
(SID)" onto their products since March of last year so that any CD
products without SID would be recognized as illegal.
</P>
<P>
Also last year, NCA introduced a copyright verification system
requiring that all imported books be registered at provincial
copyright administrative departments and CDs and movies registered
with the NCA.
</P>
<P>
So far, approximately 1,800 kinds of foreign books and audio
and video products have been registered in the country.
</P>
<P>
NCA "has even gone so far as to appoint several overseas
organizations to help verify certificates of authority." the paper
says. They include the Motion Picture Association of American and
the Hong Kong Film Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
And about 20 audio and video publishing houses in the country
were punished for presenting fake certificates of authority or fake
contracts last year.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic news
briefs from Latin America in the last three days:

World Bank Foresees Slow Economic Recovery for Mexico
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON -- Mexico's economic recovery process will be slow
this year as a result of the economic and financial crisis of 1995
in the wake of the peso devaluation, said the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The slow recovery is influenced by the high interest rates, the
peso stabilization and the reduction of the inflation rate, said
the World Bank in its report "World Economic Projections and the
Developing Countries."

Latin American, Caribbean GDP To Grow 2.6% in 1996-97
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON -- The economic prospects for the Latin American and
Caribbean countries are the best because they are applying
restrictive fiscal and monetary policies that reduce the rate of
inflation, said the World Bank in its report "World Economic
Projections and the Developing Countries."
</P>
<P>
According to the World Bank, the Latin American and Caribbean
domestic gross product (GDP) will grow 2.7 percent during the
1996-1997 period and 3.8 percent during the next decade, which
represents a per capita 2.3 percent annual rate of growth.

Chilean Trade Surplus Reaches $255.2 million
</P>
<P>
SANTIAGO -- Chile registered a 255.2 million U.S. dollars trade
surplus from January 1 to April 15 of this year, said the
country's Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
The surplus was the result of exports worth 4.64 billion
dollars and imports for 4.38 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Chile's international reserves grew 122 million dollars in
April and added up to 14.34 billion dollars by April 30.

Brazilian Industrial Output Drops 9.3%
</P>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazil's industrial production dropped 9.3
percent during the first quarter of this year, in comparison with
the same period of 1995, as reported by the Brazilian Institute of
Geography and Statistics (IBGE).
</P>
<P>
The descent shows a noticeable deceleration of the economic
activity during the recent months, IBGE's Industry Department
director Silvio Salles said Tuesday.

Argentina Biggest Soybean Oil Exporter
</P>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- Argentina will maintain in 1996 its position as
first soybean and sunflower oil exporter of the world, said the
Argentine Republic Edible Oil Industry Chamber.
</P>
<P>
The production of vegetable oils rose in 1995 to 3.8 million
tons, of which 79 percent was exported.
</P>
<P>
Argentina also hold the first place as consumer of edible oils
in Latin America, with a yearly per capita average of 22.4
kilogams, including 16.6 kilograms of vegetable oils and 5.8
kilograms of shortening greases.

Chilean Copper Mine Strike Causes Price of Metal To Rise
</P>
<P>
SANTIAGO -- Copper quotations rose to its highest level
Wednesday in the London Metals Market because of the continued
strike at the Chilean Copper mine of Chuquicamata.
</P>
<P>
Copper closed Wednesday in London with a 2.6 percent rise in
its monthly quotation to end at 128.503 cents of a dollar per
pound and its yearly quotation at 121.926 cents per pound.
</P>
<P>
The metal price shot up because of the fear of a fall in
inventories because of the strike called by 7,000 workers on May 2
in the Chuquicamata mine, according to experts in the industry.

<HEADLINE> Thai Exports Remain Strong in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The total value of Thai exports is
forecast to grow by 388 billion baht (15.5 billion US dollars) in
the first quarter this year, an increase of 18.1 percent from the
same period last year, according to a report issued by the
Department of Business Economics.
</P>
<P>
However, the value of agricultural exports is expected to drop
one percent to 58.8 billion baht (2.35 billion US dollars) as a
result of crop damage from natural disasters towards the end of
last year.
</P>
<P>
Rice exports are predicted to fall 25.7 percent since
Thailand's main competitors in the export sector, especially
Vietnam and India, have produced bumper crops.
</P>
<P>
The export volume of tapioca products is projected to decline
5.2 percent with a 14 percent drop in value.
</P>
<P>
A slight 0.9 percent increase in the export value of
agro-industrial products has been predicted, with 32.48 billion
baht (1.3 billion US dollars) worth of goods exported.
</P>
<P>
That slow growth rate has been attributed to a decrease in the
value of outbound shipments of sugar and rubber products, with
prices falling by 20.4 percent and 15.6 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Exports of industrial products should bring in 223.6 billion
baht (8.95 billion US dollars), a 17.9 percent increase over the
corresponding period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Exports of most of the principle export items, especially
electrical appliances and electronic products, continued to be
strong. At the same time, demand is increasing for computers,
computer equipment and parts, integrate circuits, video recorders,
audio equipment and parts, air conditioners and parts, and
electrical transformer and parts.
</P>
<P>
Outbound shipments of textiles and garments are expected to
fall 1.5 percent, with local fabrics being competitive in the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's export performance in major markets, especially the
European Union, ASEAN and the Asia-Pacific and Japan, should
remain strong.
</P>
<P>
Thai exports to the US, mainly gems and jewelry, frozen
shrimps, travel equipment and furniture, are expected to decline
because of a continued economic slowdown in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Dynamic Asia Facing Energy Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Sustainable energy development
has turned out to be a growing challenge for dynamic Asian
economies that have experienced the world's fastest economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
According to Guy F. Caruso, director of the Office of
Non-member countries of the International Energy Agency (IEA)
under the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD), sustainable energy development means energy growth that is
achieved in an environmentally-sound way, and that promotes
economic growth without threatening energy supply and security.
</P>
<P>
Caruso, the first director of the Non-member Office since its
founding three years ago, came to Hong Kong to attend an
international symposium on sustainable energy development in Asia.
</P>
<P>
He put the concept into "the three Es" -- economic growth,
energy security and environment. The issue is more challenging for
Asia, where economic growth is rapid, said Caruso, who has been
engaged in energy affairs for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Caruso listed three
biggest challenges currently facing the Asian developing
economies, with financing being the top concern.
</P>
<P>
In its latest World Energy Outlook, the IEA estimated that the
worldwide investment for energy between now and 2010 would be one
to 1.9 trillion US dollars; and the amount in Non-OECD members
would be between 500 and 700 billion US dollars, taking a large
share of the global total.
</P>
<P>
Asian economies except Japan are Non-OECD members, which need
huge amount of money to quench the thirst of electricity, said
Caruso, who specifically called people's attention to China and
India -- the two biggest growing economies in the region.
</P>
<P>
Another challenge for Asia is energy security, which the IEA
official explained as maintaining readiness to deal with possible
energy emergency, for instance, a worldwide shortage of oil caused
by war.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that China could become a net importer of oil as
well as other Asian countries if fast economic growth continues
into next century. Sustainable energy supply, therefore, comes to
the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Technology is also a problem facing most of Asian economies for
lack of both financial and managerial resources, added Caruso.
</P>
<P>
Judging by the 20-year experiences of IEA member countries,
Caruso said, "Every country or economy needs to find policies best
for its sustainable economic growth. It is impossible for all the
countries to develop after the same model,"
</P>
<P>
He opposed to two tendencies of either over zealously pursuing
environmental policies that are detrimental to energy production
and consumption, or heading along to economic growth targets at
the cost of long-term energy supply and environmental
friendliness.
</P>
<P>
"There is a balance to keep. Taking environment into account,
while at the same time maintaining sustainable growth of energy
production," said Caruso.
</P>
<P>
Caruso was very much impressed by the fact that many Asian
countries have put substantial emphasis on energy efficiency and
energy policies.
</P>
<P>
Caruso said that promoting technologies and enhancing
cooperation worldwide can help Asian countries overcome the
difficulties in energy development.
</P>
<P>
"Through cooperation, Asia economies are able to cope with
mistakes that developed economies have made, and share experiences
of successes and failures," said the IEA official, adding that his
office has been promoting cooperation between members and
non-members of OECD over the past three years in the form of data
exchange, policy advice or international conferences.
</P>
<P>
IEA has 23 members, mostly developed countries in Europe and
North America. In Asia Pacific region, Japan and Australia are IEA
members, and South Korea is in the process of joining in.

<HEADLINE> China To Give Adequate Water Supply To Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has worked
out a program aimed at resolving the chronic problem of water
shortages in most Chinese cities, today's China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
The program, unveiled by the Ministry of Water Resources,
outlines the development of water supply sources for 270 of the
300 cities plagued by water shortages, says the frontpage report.
</P>
<P>
It includes a total of 938 proposed projects of water sources
which, when completed, are capable of supplying more than 150
million cubic meters of water per day to these cities.
</P>
<P>
All these cities are located in areas with access to China's
seven longest rivers or large lakes including the Yangtze, Yellow,
Huaihe and Haihe rivers and Taihu Lake.
</P>
<P>
Half of China's more than 600 cities are short of water. Of
them, 108 cities are facing worsening water crises. These cities
are responsible for a combined industrial output value of 120
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Experts with the ministry were confident that "the basic water
demand of the cities' industries and more than 80 million urban
people could be ensured of adequate supplies if all the planned
projects were completed by 2010".
</P>
<P>
They estimate at least 162 billion yuan will be needed to
implement the projects, and hope the state can raise the money by
widening fund-raising channels such as the establishment of a
state foundation and the issue of stocks or use of possible
overseas funds.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Decides on Earlier Opening of Basic Telecom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government said
today that it has decided to remove Singapore Telecom's monopoly
rights and allow competition in basic telecommunication services
from the year 2000, seven years earlier than the original
schedule.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the government decision at a press conference, Mah
Bow Tan, Minister for Communications, said that by the year 2000,
many cross-border services, such as global satellite mobile
services and Internet-related services will be coming on stream.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Telecom's monopoly on basic telecommunication
services expires in 2007. But, from 2002, the Telecommunication
Authority of Singapore (TAS), as a proxy competitor, has the right
to allow broadcasting operators and other public telecommunication
licensees to offer telecommunication services which are ancillary
and incidental to their principal services.
</P>
<P>
"However, this approach does not allow us to introduce
competition in an optimal way," Mah said.
</P>
<P>
The government has therefore decided to modify Singapore
Telecom's licence explicitly, to end its monopoly on basic
telecommunication services earlier than 2007, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This way, it can introduce competition in a controlled and
even-handed way," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister also promised that the government would compensate
the Singapore Telecom "fully and fairly" for any likely loss in
earnings as a result of the modification in its licence. He said
the amount was computed to be 1.5 billion Singapore dollars (about
1.1 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Noting that developed countries in Europe and North America
have set 1998 as the target date for liberalizing their own
telecommunication markets, the minister said, "it is not feasible
for Singapore to open up by 1998", in view of the lead time needed
to introduce competition.
</P>
<P>
The process of proper tendering, selection and service roll-out
would require at least 36 months, he said.

Mexico To Import 8.5 Million Tons of Basic Grains
</P>
<P>
MEXICO CITY -- Romarico Arroyo Marroquin, undersecretary of
Agriculture in the Agriculture, Livestock, and Rural Development
Ministry said that as the result of the serious drought affecting
the country, 640,000 hectares were not cultivated, and this will
cause this year the import of grains to increase from 4.5 million
tons a year, to 8.5 million tons. He mentioned that the biggest
imports will be of corn, at 5.5 million tons a year.

Brazilian Motorcar Output Reaches Record Figure
</P>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO -- The Brazilian motorcar industry produced
during the first four-month period of the year the record number
of 538,000 motor vehicles, a 7.55 percent increase over the same
period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
This was the best four-month period in the history of the
industry, but not enough to reach the projected 15 percent rate of
growth for the whole year, said the president of the National
Association of Motor Vehicles Manufacturers Silvano Valentino.

<HEADLINE> Central America Promotes Tourism for Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Central American countries have
paid more attention to the development of tourism without damage
to the environment.
</P>
<P>
During the 18th Central American summit on the development for
tourism, the presidents agreed to implement a strategy to turn
Central America into an integrated tourist region, a source of
bigger revenue of hard currency from the so-called "industry
without smokestacks."
</P>
<P>
The summit, held on May 8-9 in the resort city of Montelimar on
the Pacific coast of Nicaragua, was attended by the presidents
from Costa Rica, Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras,
Nicaragua and Panama.
</P>
<P>
"Our target is to make tourism the main source of revenue for
our countries," the Central American presidents said in a
statement of Montelimar signed on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The presidents approved a program of regional action to
consolidate tourism "as a strategic and priority economic
activity" for the sustainable development of the region.
</P>
<P>
"We can translate our desires into concrete action to make
tourism a fundamental activity for our development," said
Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro during the closing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"We are talking about opening our borders for the tourist to
feel himself in a single country, but enjoy the advantages of the
diversity of natural and cultural resources," she added.
</P>
<P>
Central America has the best conditions for tourist development
by its geographical location, natural beauties, rich cultures and
tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the Central American countries earned 1.3 billion
U.S. dollars from more than two million foreign tourists. However,
the lack of security, financial resources and non-uniform
legislation hamper tourism from reaching a better development in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The regional action program approved during the summit makes a
general draft of the fundamental guidelines, regional priorities,
legislation, financing and stimulating policies to promote the
tourist integration of the region.
</P>
<P>
The presidents ordered their respective governments to present
a report of compliance with the agreements on the migratory matter
before the Council of Foreign Ministers in the region within three
months.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to hold a forum with the participation of the
top authorities of tourism, migration, customs, health,
agriculture and police to discuss the facilitation of tourism and
present recommendations about the matter.
</P>
<P>
The presidents asked the Central American Economic Integration
Bank to give a priority to tourism and called on the World Tourism
Organization to support and cooperate with the regional actions.

<P>
The newly-elected president made this remark at a meeting with
Guo Chaoren, president of China's Xinhua News Agency, who arrived
here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sampaio said that it was the duty of Portugal and China to
jointly ensure the smooth transfer which would be closely watched by
the international community.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Sino-Portuguese joint communique on the issue
of Macao was an important document which he described as more
significant than the transfer itself.
</P>
<P>
Sampaio said that further cooperation between the Xinhua News
Agency and its Portuguese equivalent LUSA will be conducive to the
smooth transfer as well as to the friendly ties between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Guo is visiting Portugal at the invitation of LUSA Director

<HEADLINE> Young Women Earn More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The income of young female workers
has surpassed that of older women in Beijing, according to a
survey funded by the State Science and Technology Commission.
</P>
<P>
An article carried on today's China Daily reports the survey
included 1,000 women between the age of 18 and 40, whose average
monthly income is 1,040.8 yuan (125.4 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The survey covered women of six occupations, ranging from
laborers, professional technicians, civil servants, company office
workers and students.
</P>
<P>
Among the group earning a monthly income between 801 and 1,500
yuan, 66 percent of those surveyed were 18-29 years old, while
women between the age of 35 and 40 accounted for only seven
percent.
</P>
<P>
Among the group earning more than 1,501 yuan, 56 percent were
18 to 29, while 10 percent were women between 35 and 40.
</P>
<P>
This indicates less regard for seniority as the arbiter of
income, the only standard or condition for promotion and raises
under the planned economy, says the report.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the income of white-collar workers was lower than
that of manual workers.
</P>
<P>
The situation has reversed as hiring policies favor highly
educated employees to help firms keep up with rapid economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Among the 1,000 women surveyed, the average monthly income
generally rose with the level of education.
</P>
<P>
For those with junior middle school education, senior middle
school education, college for professional training education and
university education the respective earnings were 635 yuan, 954
yuan, 1,507 yuan and 1,017 yuan.
</P>
<P>
More women in the highest paid group (31 percent) work in
overseas-funded or private enterprises or are self-employed than
other groups.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 11 (Xinhua) -- In the vote of no-confidence this
morning in the Thai Parliament, Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-Archa, in his capacity as the Interior Minister, won
confidence of 230 MPs, with no objection.
</P>
<P>
When the vote on him was called, all 159 opposition MPs, except
opposition Leader Chuan Leekpai, rose from their seats and walked
out of the chamber in protest that Banharn escaped grilling last
night.
</P>
<P>
The government holds 232 seats in the Lower House.
</P>
<P>
The 230 votes which Banharn got exceeded the required half of
the valid votes.
</P>
<P>
Chuan Leekpai, who was the only opposition MP present when
Banharn was voted on, abstained.
</P>
<P>
Banharn escaped grilling last night when the no-confidence
debate closed before the opposition had a chance to launch an
attack on him as the Interior Minister during the three-day
no-confidence debate, which began Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The opposition planned to grill 10 cabinet members, but only
had time to grill seven of them.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Anne McLellan, Canada's Minister of
Natural Resources, will lead a trade mission to China during a
tour of the Asia-Pacific region starting from May 15.
</P>
<P>
Her travel, which is scheduled to last nearly two weeks, also
will bring the minister to South Korea and Thailand, the Canadian
government announced today in a news release.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, in south China, will be included in McLellan's
itinerary.
</P>
<P>
The minister "will promote stronger trade and investment ties,
long-term partnerships and sustainable development initiatives"
with the Asian countries and region, the government said.
</P>
<P>
In China, the news release noted, McLellan "will promote
Canada-China trade relations in the areas of nuclear energy, oil
and gas, forestry, mining, geoscience and geomatics."
</P>
<P>
She plans to meet with China's Ministers of Forestry and of
Geology and Mineral Resources, and with senior officials of the
China National Nuclear Corporation, the China National Petroleum
Corporation, the State Planning Commission, and the National
Environment Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
"This visit demonstrates the government's commitment to joint
government-industry business development as a highly effective way
to promote Canadian goods and services in international markets,"
said the release.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Asia-Pacific region is one of the
fastest-growing markets for Canadian exports, McLellan said her
visit is making an important contribution to economic growth and
job creation in Canada.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai No-Confidence Debate Ends in Chaos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Thai parliament is scheduled to
meet today to vote on the three-day no-confidence debate, which
ended in chaos late last night.
</P>
<P>
Turmoil began at about 9:15 last night, when Prime Minister
Banharn Silpa-archa, who is also interior minister, stood up to
give his reply to some of the charges which some Opposition MPs
touched upon in their earlier remarks.
</P>
<P>
In his 30-minute reply, Banharn read a prepared text to defend
himself against charges that he, as interior minister, failed to
contain crime, and against charges of plagiarism for his Master's
degree thesis.
</P>
<P>
Banharn's speech prompted howl of protest from the Opposition
because they realized that the government was planning to close
the debate before they actually grilled the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
When Banharn finished his speech, an MP from his Chart Thai
(Thai Nation) Party, Chachawal Chompudaeng, rose to move that the
debate be closed.
</P>
<P>
Chaos broke out with boos, jeers and shouts from the
Opposition.
</P>
<P>
The Opposition said they still had 12 MPs waiting to speak
while insisting that the debate should not be closed as they had
not yet had the chance to debate against three of their planned 10
targets, namely, Banharn in his capacity as interior minister,
Deputy Finance Minister Newin Chidchob and Commerce Minister
Chucheep Harnsawasdi.
</P>
<P>
Opposition MPs called foul, accused the government of closing
the debate to save Banharn from grilling and called the closure
the government's "beneath the belt" tactic.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Boon-eua Prasertsuwan made an emotional appeal to
MPs to maintain orderliness and save the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the Opposition for not being able to manage their own
time, saying they had previously agreed that the debate would last
only three days, which began Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thaksin Shinawatra, leader of the Palang Dharma
(Virtue Force) Party, which is in the seven-party coalition
government, said last night that his party would consider public
sentiment in deciding how to vote today and is ready for a
coalition showdown.
</P>
<P>
Of the 10 cabinet members targeted by the Opposition, five are
from Banharn's Chart Thai Party. They were accused of involving
ethical impropriety, land rights and ownership scandals,
incompetence and corruption.
</P>
<P>
After the closing of the debate last night, Banharn held an
urgent meeting with Thaksin.
</P>
<P>
When they finished their meeting shortly after midnight, they
refused to disclose any details. Thaksin only said that his party
would meet early today before the vote of confidence scheduled for
late this morning.
</P>
<P>
What happened last night sparked widespread speculation that
the Palang Dharma Party may pull out of the coalition.
</P>
<P>
The government now holds 232 seats while the Opposition holds
159 seats in the lower House.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM on Practice of Democracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad, who is also president of the ruling United
Malays National Organization (UMNO), said here today that
Malaysia's system of democracy is democracy for the good of the
people and the nation and not democracy for democracy's sake.
</P>
<P>
In his policy speech at the UMNO's 50th anniversary convention
at the World Trade Center here, Mahathir said: "Malaysia's
democracy is not a religion. We are aware of the good of a
democratic system but are not overzealous about it to the point
that we accept without questioning everything that is done in the
name of democracy."
</P>
<P>
"If the people and the country benefit, then we will accept the
practices which are said to be democracy. On the other hand, if
the people and the nation get only the worst from any practice
that is said to be democratic, we will give priority to what is
good for the country and people and put aside the question of
whether or not it is democratic," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
He told the convention that the democracy practiced in Malaysia
was not like western democracy.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that since the UMNO upheld democracy, it was
important for UMNO members and leaders to understand the
strengthen and weakness of a democratic system so that they did
not lose sight and destroy themselves.
</P>
<P>
The UMNO's 50th anniversary convention to chart the party's
direction in the 21st century was opened by Mahathir today. About
2,700 people comprising UMNO supreme council members, youth and
woman leaders in the party, attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
More than 10 foreign delegations, including the Chinese
Communist Party's delegation headed by Li Chengren, deputy head of
the Chinese Communist Party's International Liaison Department,
also attended the convention.
</P>
<P>
This evening, the UMNO will give a large banquet to celebrate
its 50th birthday, which is reported to be attended by more than
12,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Approves Auto parts exchange with ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The government of Thailand has
allowed Toyota Motor Thailand to exchange auto parts with
countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
under the Affordable Family Car (AFC) project.
</P>
<P>
A committee on industrial cooperation with foreign countries
has approved the Toyota parts exchange project as part of the
brand-to-brand complementation (BBC) scheme Wednesday, according
to local newspaper Bangkok Post today.
</P>
<P>
Under the (BBC) scheme, automobile assemblers in four ASEAN
countries -- Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines --
earlier agreed to freely exchange auto parts to reduce
manufacturing costs.
</P>
<P>
At that time, automobile assemblers were given tariff
reductions, with the import duties on completely knocked down
parts reduced to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Director General of the Thai Industrial Economics Office
Chamnong Phanuschutabul said Toyota Motor Thailand would exchange
auto parts of vehicles in Toyota's AFC series and the
Transportation Unit Vehicle (TUV) Corolla series.
</P>
<P>
Chamnong said the parts exchange under the AFC series would
promote Thailand as an export base in the region. The AFC series
is the first in which Toyota Motor Corporation of Japan has joint
bands with Toyota Motor Thailand to develop cars for ASEAN
customers.

<HEADLINE> Spain to Cut 1.6 billion Dollars Public Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Spain's new cabinet today approved
200 billion pesetas in public spending cuts and reduction by
one-third the number of senior positions in government ministries.
</P>
<P>
The spending cuts, worth about 1.6 billion U.S. dollars, are
aimed at trimming the budget deficit to three percent of the gross
domestic product (GDP) by 1997 to meet Maastricht Treaty criteria
for joining the single European currency.
</P>
<P>
Spain's deficit last year stood at 5.9 percent of GDP, or the
country's total output of goods and services. And new prime
minister Jose Maria Aznar has said he wants to bring it down to
4.4 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The deficit-slashing plan includes a major privatization drive
that targets all state-run companies for sale except the postal
system, the railways and defence-related industries.
</P>
<P>
Industry Minister Josep Pique said that one of the first firms
to be sold would be Teneo, a group that owns most of the state-run
companies in the country, including national airline Iberia.
</P>
<P>
The government also wants to sell off other publicly owned
firms not controlled by Teneo, such as petrochemical company
Repsol, Telefonica and banking group Argentaria.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Be Biggest Palm Oil Producer in 2005 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia could become the biggest
producer of crude palm oil (CPO) in the world by 2005, an official
said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, which produced 4.35 million tons of CPO last year,
is predicted to replace Malaysia as the biggest CPO producer by
the year 2005, Chairman of the Indonesian CPO Businessmen
Association Derom Bangun said in Medan, capital of Sumatra
province Friday, according to reports reaching here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia at present is the world biggest CPO producer with its
production capacity of 7.8 million tons per year.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia however has set a target to produce about 10 million
tons of CPO by 2005.
</P>
<P>
"Unlike in Indonesia, Malaysia's CPO production in the next few
years will likely move at a slower rate because of its limited
area for CPO plantation," Bangun said.
</P>
<P>
In Indonesia, he said, the state, private and foreign CPO
companies in the past two years have expanded their plantations in
Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Irian Jaya provinces.
</P>
<P>
With a total of 2 million hectares of CPO plantation, Indonesia
is expected to produce 4.9 million tons of CPO this year. "The
area (of CPO plantation) is increasing by 200,000 hectares a
year," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate in Canada
edged up to 9.4 percent in April, one-tenth of a percentage point
higher than in March, Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
Canada's labor force expansion outpaced last month job growth,
which saw some 40,000 new jobs created across the country.
</P>
<P>
Employment among adults aged 25 and over grew by 26,000 in
April, the fifth consecutive monthly increase. Yet, unemployment
among youths is still as high as 15.3 percent, little changed
since 1992.
</P>
<P>
According to a study released Thursday by the Bank of Nova
Scotia, the underlying jobless rate in Canada is 13 percent, which
is much higher than the federal government statistics.
</P>
<P>
Slow job growth and declining employment have left many
Canadians anxious about the future, the study said.

<HEADLINE> New Housing Price Declines in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Prices of new housing have declined
2.9 percent across Canada over the past 21 months, Statistics
Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
In the past 12 months, the new housing price index has declined
2.3 percent, the federal fact-gathering agency said.
</P>
<P>
Prices of new housing on the West Coast have recorded the
deepest drop in the country. Comparing March 1995 with March
1996, housing prices have dropped 8.3 percent in Victoria and 6.2
percent in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
The price drop was the result of low consumer confidence,
which, the agency said, also contributed to a sharp decline in
housing construction starts.
</P>
<P>
However, it noted, there are now indications that this downward
trend may ease in 1996.

JAKARTA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials from the
seven-member  Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
Friday ended their ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) meeting in
Yogyakarta, Central Java, 450 km east of Jakarta, with a
recommendation that the forum accept India and Myanmar as members.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting proceeded in a spirit of mutual cooperation and
understanding," Director General of Political Affairs of the

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian PM Appeals for Nationwide Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian Prime Minister Zhan Videnov
today appealed to politicians and ordinary people alike to support
a government plan to stave off a looming financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to parliament, Videnov said that his government had
identified the causes of the country's financial problems and
would implement drastic measures to redress them.
</P>
<P>
The government will back efforts by the central bank to halt
the depreciation of the Bulgarian currency and to increase
exports, he said.
</P>
<P>
The lev has lost almost a quarter of its value this year and
the central bank's foreign exchange reserves have halved to 700
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
To bring in foreign investment, Videnov said, privatization
would be speeded up by offering investors incentives to buy a
stake in state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister appealed to parliament for quick approval of
the 1996 privatization program which includes tax breaks for
private companies and preferential taxes for foreign-funded
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's banking system, currently close to
collapse, would recover after laws rationalizing and tightening
supervision of banks are ratified by parliament.
</P>
<P>
Many large state firms have stopped servicing debts to
Bulgarian banks, two-thirds of which are insolvent.
</P>
<P>
Videnov said that international financial institutions have
promised support for Bulgaria's efforts to stabilize its finances.
</P>
<P>
Videnov met deputy managing director of the International
Monetary Fund Yohanes Wainholc on Wednesday and called for "timely
and telling support" from the IMF.

<HEADLINE> Peruvian Economy to Resume Growth in Year's 2nd Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Peru's economic growth is nearly zero
for now, but will start growing at the beginning of the second
half of the year, said Economy and Finance Minister Jorge Camel.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian economy will close 1996 with a domestic gross
product (GDP) growth between three and four percent, said Camel in
an article published today in the "El Comercio" daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said, the annual growth rate will still
be almost 50 percent below that registered in 1995.
</P>
<P>
This year's GDP, namely the nation's total output of goods and
services, is expected to reach 60.9 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Camel considered it as "perfectly normal" that the Peruvian
economy grew at 8.5 percent a year during the last three years,
and then drop to three- or four-percent levels.
</P>
<P>
The growth contraction, he said, could help solve the current
account deficit in the balance of payments without causing a
sudden drop in production.
</P>
<P>
Data released by the Central Bank of the Reserve suggest that
agriculture will grow 2.5 percent, fishing 1.9 percent, mining 3.5
percent, manufacturing 4.6 percent, construction 3.9 percent,
while other activities, including commerce, banking services,
transports and communications, and housing, will grow 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The GDP growth at the start of the year's second half will
sustain mainly on agriculture, fishing, mining, oil, and programs
of construction and maintenance of inter-city and rural roads.

<HEADLINE> Barcelona Settles for "Moral Compensation" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Barcelona has dropped an appeal to the
Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) over the outcome of last
month's European basketball champion clubs' final against
Panathinaikos.
</P>
<P>
The club has been provided instead with what the International
Basketball Federation (FIBA) described on Friday as "moral
compensation".
</P>
<P>
Barcelona lost 67-66 in a dramatic match but complained the
Greeks should have been penalised for violating the 30-second
shooting rule in the last minute.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish club was also upset by a crucial block four seconds
 from time which it argued was irregular because it was made
after the ball had hit the board behind the net. The block, by
giant Croat Stojan Vrankovic, saved the game for the Greeks.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Gullit Appointed Chelsea Club Player-Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The England Chelsea football club
appointed tonight Rudd Gulllit to replace out-going Glenn Hoddle
as the club's new player-manager.
</P>
<P>
Gullit, 33, is the overwhelming fans's favourate to take over
the job of Hoddle, who has recently been appointed the new coach
of the England national team.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch international soccer star has been given a two-year
contract and his playing contract has been extended to June 1998.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that managing director Colin Hutchinson will
take control of the financial matters for signings and contracts
and Gullit will concentrate purely on the playing side.
</P>
<P>
"When I knew Glenn was leaving, Ruud was one of the people we
immediately thought of and it was a unianimous decision by the
board to offer it to him," Hutching said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chelsea has stepped up their bid to sign Juventus
striker Gianluca Vialli and he is already learing English,
Hutchinson said.
</P>
<P>
"The crunch will be whether Vialli decides to continue his
career in Italy or, like Gullit, he decides to seek new
territories," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If that is the case, then there is a chance that he will come
to England. We are in the ring with some big hitters, but we are
still on our fee," he added.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Builds Modern Financial Payment System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Banks in Shenzhen, a special
economic zone in south China, have installed a computer network to
enable people to deposit and draw money at any offices of the
banks.
</P>
<P>
China's first financial electronic clearance center was
launched in Shenzhen a few months ago, inaugurating a regional
electronic and paperless clearance network.
</P>
<P>
One of China's first cities aiming to establish a modern
payment system, Shenzhen has been connected with more than 8,000
banking offices in 400 cities across the country through
satellites and computers, sending and receiving capital quickly
and conveniently.
</P>
<P>
It is the most active city in China to send the largest amount
of capital to other places, and it ranks fourth in the amount of
capital it receives.
</P>
<P>
An automatic commercial instrument sorting system has gone into
operation in the city, handling about 50,000 commercial
instruments daily, with annual transactions topping 90 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
More than 700 banking offices have joined the system, dealing
with commercial instruments denominated in yuan, US and
Hong Kong dollars.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen was the first Chinese city to introduce a network of
ATMs, and the zone is expected to install many more ATMs
within the year.

<HEADLINE> Chips Prices Down as PC Sales Get Slow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The market demand for computer and
other chips remains weak as personal computer makers trying to
reduce excess inventories created by sluggish sales late last year.
</P>
<P>
The Semiconductor Industry Association reported Thursday that
the book-to-bill ratio, the key indicator of the industry, fell in
April to 0.78 -- its lowest point in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The ratio was slightly worse than Wall Street analysts had
expected. Stocks of chipmakers dropped Thursday in anticipation
of a weak ratio. But the technology-heavy index of NASDAQ today
surged 13.90 points to a record high of 1,201.72. The technology
sector was boosted by a strong earnings report from some major
companies.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said the ratio was not disastrous, as the
industry is going through its sharpest correction in a decade.
</P>
<P>
The 0.78 ratio means that for every 100 U.S. dollars of chips
shipped, chipmakers received only 78 U.S. dollars of orders. In
April 1995, the ratio was 1.16.

<P>
ROME, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Martina Hingis produced the biggest
upset in women's tennis this year, when the 15-year-old defeated
world number one Steffi Graf at the the Italian Open tennis
tournament here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Graf, who will next week celebrate the longest ever stay at the
top of the women's rankings, at 332 weeks, was beaten 6-2, 2-6,
3-6 by the Swiss teenager in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Hingis will now meet the second surprise packet of the
tournament, Romanian Irina Spirlea, who upset Spanish third seed
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, winner of last week's Hamburg tournament.
</P>
<P>
Fellow Spaniard Conchita Martinez meets Croatian Iva Majoli in
Saturday's other semi-final.
</P>
<P>
Graf, who had won their two previous meetings, but had never
met Hingis on clay, made a promising start but her concentration
went to pieces from the second set onwards.
</P>
<P>
The turning point came in the third when Graf, facing her third
break point of the game, double-faulted to hand her opponent a
5-3 lead. Hingis served out for victory, clinching the tie when
Graf hit a forehand long.
</P>
<P>
Graf, winner of both the previous tournaments she had entered
this year, at Indian Wells and Key Biscayne, had not lost since
Brighton last October.

<HEADLINE> Ogata, Bosnian Serb Minister Discuss Refugee Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) Sadako Ogata and Bosnian Serb Minister for
Refugees and Displaced Persons Ljubisa Vladusic held talks today
on the problem of refugees and the freedom of movement in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
After touring both entities in Bosnia -- Republika Srpska and
Muslim-Croat federation -- to find out the living conditions of
refugees, Ogata said the situation was improving and that people
wanted to return to their homes, Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
More than 2.4 million Bosnian people have become refugees and
displaced persons due to the civil war in the country, of whom 1
million are in Bosnia and the others are staying in other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Many problems remain in respect of the repatriation of
refugees, Ogata said in Serb stronghold Pale near Sarajevo, adding
that more efforts must be made to rebuild houses destroyed by the
war to pave the way for the return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
Freedom of movement must be ensured in line with the Dayton
accord, the high commissioner said. So far there is still no
freedom of movement for the civilians in Bosnia, thus prohibiting
refugees from returning to their old homes in the former enemy's
territories.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Serb minister Vladusic urged Ogata to provide more
help to the refugees, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR plans to repatriate about 200,000 refugees from Europe
and about 170,000 from the former Yugoslav republics, as well as
some 500,000 inside Bosnia by the end of this year. Under the
UNHCR three-phased plan, all the Bosnian refugees are expected to
settle down in Bosnia by the end of next year.

<HEADLINE> New York City to Build Rail Link to Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 10 (Xinhua) -- New York Port Authority has
decided to build a railway line to connect Manhattan, business
center of New York City, to Kennedy International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The project would cost the city about one billion U.S. dollars,
and part of the spending will be collected by charging three
dollars on any traveler who may use the airport.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the new railway could begin by the end of the
year and operation of the city-to-airport link would be by 2001,
according to a report by the New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
The paper notes that without a working rail line, travelers
have been forced to drive the congested roads leading to the
airport, or pay 30 dollars for a cab ride from Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
Some 100,000 people travel to and from the airport daily.
</P>
<P>
City officials estimated that a trip to the airport from the
center of Manhattan would take about 45 minutes when the new
project is completed.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Aims to Normalize Relations with IMF, PM Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Prime Minister Radoje
Kontic said today normalization of relations with world financial
and trade organizations is one of Yugoslavia's strategic goals.
</P>
<P>
"Unless we institutionalize relations with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and other financial organizations, no free
access to the world capital market will be possible, nor
dynamising business activity, nor necessary structural changes,"
the prime minister told Serbian radio and television this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The rump Yugoslavia, comprised of Serbia and Montenegro,
suffered an international sanctions from May 1992 to November
1995. Although many countries have recognized Yugoslavia
diplomatically, the country still has a long way to go before it
can completely return to the United Nations and other key
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
He said Yugoslavia had taken certain activities to maintain
ties with international financial and trade organizations even
while the country had been under the U.N. sanctions, and said the
suspension of the sanctions marked the beginning of dynamisation
of this process.
</P>
<P>
In order to get big sum of loans to salvage the devastated
economy, Yugoslavia has opened talks with the IMF, the World Trade
Organization, the European Investment Bank, the World Bank for
Reconstruction and Development and financial organizations.
</P>
<P>
Kontic said the Yugoslav government had set up a commission for
coordination of relations with the IMF and other international
financial institutions in late October 1995, with himself chairing
the commission.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia failed to reach agreement with the IMF at the talks
held in Paris early last month because Yugoslavia insists that it
be the sole successor of the old Yugoslav federation shattered in
1991 when four other republics broke away.
</P>
<P>
"Positions for talks with the IMF and the World Bank have been
defined by representatives of the relevant federal bodies, the
National Bank of Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav Chamber of Commerce as
well as by a large number of experts and scholars," he said.
</P>
<P>
The commission's activity has resulted in preparation of a
paper titled Basis and Framework of Yugoslavia's stabilization and
development policy, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The paper has been reviewed within both the activity of the
federal government working bodies and regular consultations with
the republican premiers and has been positively assessed," he said.

<HEADLINE> UK Consumer Spending Continues to Rise in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- High street sales in Britain last
month continued to improve, rekindling hopes of a consumer-led
economic revival during 1996, according to the Confederation of
British Industry's (CBI) latest distributive trades survey
published today.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the CBI's monthly poll of 15,000 shops and
stores, 49 percent of high street outlets said trade was brisker
last month than in the same period last year, compared with 17
percent reporting that sales had dropped.
</P>
<P>
The gap of 32 percentage points between these two figures was
sharply up on the 27-point difference reported in March, and the
highest since December 1993, the CBI said.
</P>
<P>
Clothing and footwear stores saw a marked pick-up in business
in April as consumers flocked to buy warm-weather clothes.
</P>
<P>
Household-related spending also jumped, with furniture and
carpet shops, along with hardware and china stores, recording a
bumper month, according to the CBI survey.
</P>
<P>
Alastair Eperon, the chairman of the CBI's distributive trades
panel, said that it was encouraging that the increase in sales
volumes seen in March had carried through last month, but warned
that the figures may have been boosted by the early date of
Easter.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street advanced
broadly today as bonds rallied on a mild inflation reading,
sending long-term interest rates back below 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Technology and smaller-company stocks ended a week-long slump,
sending the Nasdaq market and other indexes back into record
territories.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary calculations, the Dow Jones industrial
average rose 43.00 to 5,518.14.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 7 to 3.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume totaled 428.36 million shares, up from 403.80
million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 3.41 to 350.02. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index rose 6.65 to 652.09.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index surged 13.90 to 1,201.72, setting
a new record.
</P>
<P>
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 4.12
to 591.33.
</P>
<P>
The Dow and broader blue-chip measures have swung widely in the
past week amid mixed signals on inflation and rising bond yields,
which has diverted some investors from stocks into bonds.
</P>
<P>
The technology sector was boosted by another strong earnings
report from an industry bellwether. Cisco Systems announced late
Thursday that its profit rose 84 percent in its fiscal third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Many semiconductor issues were strong despite another dreary
report on chip demand.
</P>
<P>
Bond prices surged today after the government reported a
surprisingly small increase in wholesale prices during April. The
yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.92 percent.

<P>
LONDON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister John Bruton
held 30-minute talks on the Northern Ireland peace process this
afternoon with David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party
(UUP) in Ulster, according to reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
The hastily-arranged talks, which was held in Bruton's private
residence outside the capital of the Irish Republic, was generally
considered as important because it came just three weeks ahead of
the Northern Ireland elections scheduled for May 30.
</P>
<P>
Recently relations between the Irish government and the UUP
have been strained.
</P>
<P>
Trimble and his party have suspected that the Irish government
strongly supports the position of Sinn Fein, political wing of the
Irish Republican Army (IRA), namely the reunification of the whole
island of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
But an Irish government spokesman described the talks, their
third meeting in the Irish Republic, as relaxed and friendly.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the two sides "maximized their mutual
understanding of each other's position", but inevitably remained
differences between them.
</P>
<P>
The Irish premier once again to press Trimble and the UUP for a
more positive engagement in the planned all-party talks process to
be convened on June 10.

<HEADLINE> Britain Warned About Dangers of Euro Currency Opt-out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior European Union (EU)
official has issued a stark warning to the British government that
Britain could be marginalized if staying out of the European
Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference on the European single currency in
London, EU Monetary Affairs Commissioner Yves-Thibalut de Silguy
said that Britain could eventually lose its significant political
influence to France and Germany if British pound sterling was kept
out the EMU.
</P>
<P>
"The UK would probably have a greater influence in the
practical preparations if it were more fully committed to the
project. This point is increasingly understood in the City," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commissioner pointed out, "Politically, if the UK stays
on the sidelines, there is a greater danger of France and Germany
getting ahead of the pack."
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that the current sluggish economic
situation in the EU had made it harder for some member states to
meet the strict Maastricht Treaty convergence criteria, but he
still insisted that the goals stipulated in the Maastricht Treaty
were still feasible.
</P>
<P>
"My message is that the single currency is well on track and
Europe will have the Euro on 1 January 1999 and the political
commitment of member states is unflinching," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the anti-European tide is gathering momentum in
Britain as the EU Commission is still reluctant to lift the
world-wide ban on British beef products exports.
</P>
<P>
A group of Tory Euro-sceptics are planning to step up the their
campaign to for a national referendum on the country's European
policy.

<HEADLINE> Johnson Pledges To Cooperate With African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Liberia's warlord Roosevelt Johnson,
who is at the center of renewed fighting in the country, has
pledged to cooperate with African peacekeepers, mandated
to disarm guerrilla armies, said reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The reports said Johnson's pledge was contained in a statement
he issued in Accra, capital of Ghana, on Thursday, as demanded by
foreign ministers of the Economic Community of West African Sates
(ECOWAS), which sent the west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG
to Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers who met in Accra on Wednesday over the
issue of Liberia demanded a pledge of good conduct from Johnson
as a trade-off for his reinstatement in Liberia's coalition
cabinet, in which he was rural development minister.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, foreign ministers of west African
countries believed that the sacking of Johnson from the cabinet
was a cause of renewed fighting in Monrovia, capital of Liberia,
since April 6.
</P>
<P>
"We here express and pledge our whole-hearted support and
cooperation with ECTWAS and ECOMOG, in bringing peace to
Liberia," Johnson was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We confirm, affirm, and commit our efforts to cooperate with
ECOMOG and the international community, as well as the Liberian
people as we have done duing the past years," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Accra meeting also asked the warlord to return the heavy
weapons which his men seized from ECOMOG during clashes last
December and January.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers also ordered Liberia's warring armies to
hand over their weapons to ECOMOG, as demanded by the peace
accord signed last August in the Nigerian capital of Abuja, which
is seen as the most comprehensive attempt to end Liberia's
six-year conflict.
</P>
<P>
They also demanded guerrillas to leave Monrovia, designated in
the accord as a safe haven under the control of the Nigeria-led
ECOMOG force.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the foreign ministers was held for making
preparations for an emergency summit of the nine west African
countries to discuss the crisis in Liberia. The summit was
scheduled to open on Wednesday in Accra, but only presidents of
Ghana and Sierra Leone were in the city, with the heads of state
of other seven countries staying away.
</P>
<P>
The summit, according to observers, has already suffered an
apparent setback by a boycott by Liberia's faction leaders
Charles Taylor and Alhaji Kromah, who're also at the center of
the current fighting in Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
The fighting broke out in Monrovia on April 6 when Liberia's
ruling council tried to arrest Johnson on murder charge.

<HEADLINE> News Feature: Friendship On Roof Of Africa (part </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Chen Cailin)
</P>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- On the Ethiopian plateau
reputed as "the Roof of Africa", engaged in active work is a
13-member Chinese medical team highly praised by local residents
as "angels in white".
</P>
<P>
The Chinese medical team, with the trust by the Chinese
people, is supporting the wounded and rescuing the dying by
overcoming a myriad of difficulties such as hypoxia and lack of
medical facilities and equipment. Their down-to-earth spirit is
eulogized far and wide in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Patients and relatives regard the doctors and nurses as
"saviors ", while government officials praise them as "envoys of
friendship". They have done a lot of hard and conscientious work.
Facts speak for themselves.
</P>
<P>
One day, in front of the Department of Gynecology and
Obstetrics of Adama Hospital in the city of Nazret, 90 kilometers
southeast of Addis Ababa, a crowd of people surrounded two
Chinese women doctors warmly.
</P>
<P>
A 30-year-old Ethiopian woman was kissing the hands of the
Chinese doctors with grateful tears running down her face, saying
: "You are my savior, I and my family will bear you in mind
forever."
</P>
<P>
Masaat, the woman, could not thank the Chinese doctors enough,
because she was rescued by the doctors from the verge of death
two weeks before.
</P>
<P>
When sent to the hospital, Masaat was in a coma. Diagnosis
showed that her case was term pregnancy with ruptured uterus. She
suffered a shock with blood pressure measured at zero. Her life
was in a great danger.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese doctors conducted an operation immediately,
despite the fact that the facilities of the hospital were very
limited: no sufficient fluid for infusion, no blood bank and no
medicine to raise blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
Taking the grave challenge, the Chinese doctors tried their
best to realize the "one percent hope". When the abdominal cavity
was opened, they found that the uterus was completely broken.
</P>
<P>
With a great endeavor, the doctors performed the immediate
operation and took post-operational measures to rescue the woman.
Their efforts turned out to be a success.
</P>
<P>
The two women doctors, Tao Gui'e and Yang Yanqing, have so far
saved the lives of not only Massat, but also many others.
</P>
<P>
Last October, they rescued another woman suffering infectious
shock. For four consecutive days, no blood pressure could be
measured of the women. Her family and Ethiopian doctors lost
confidence in the case.
</P>
<P>
Tao and Yang, however, studied a rescue scheme with the help
of other doctors and surgeons. They cut open the veins of the
patient, and conducted an operation of large amount rehydration
with anti-biotics apart from a curettage.
</P>
<P>
Through an intensive care and treatment for more than two
weeks, the woman was finally rescued from the jaws of death. Upon
her discharge from the hospital, she held the hands of the
Chinese doctors, deeply grateful to them for their giving her a
second life.
</P>
<P>
The two women doctors, in many cases, took out big tumors
from the cavities of ailing women, with the biggest one weighing
25 kilograms. Also in many cases, they did mouth-to-mouth breathing
to rescue babies suffering asphxia.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the two doctors wrote an academic thesis titled
"Post-Operational Analysis Of 54 Cases of Ruptured Uterus". The
thesis was carried in a magazine of Ethiopia's annual medical
conference, and will be read in a forthcoming conference
scheduled late May.

ADDIS ABABA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Adama Hospital is responsible
for treating patients from among farmers and herdsmen in an area
of hundreds of square kilometers. With a great many patients daily,
work demand here is enormous even on holidays and Sundays.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, a male patient called at the surgical dept.
as he suffered a severe bone fracture in his lower extremities.
In light of the usual practice, amputation ought to be applied.
</P>
<P>
Chinese surgeons Mu Xicai and Zhang Binyu, however, thought
that the amputation operation was simple, but it would bring
about much inconvenience to the patient and his family after the
operation.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, they changed the treatment plan and designed first
