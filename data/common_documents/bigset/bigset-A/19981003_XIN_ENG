<HEADLINE> Blair Urges Tough International Response on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
Friday called for immediate and strong international response to
Kosovo crisis following two recent massive killings in Kosovo,
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the annual Labor Party conference in Blackpool,
Blair said: "For heaven's sake, let us get our act together now
and give him (Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic) the message
that he needs to be given."
</P>
<P>
"What is happening in Kosovo is entirely unacceptable and the
only way of stopping it is President Milosevic knows that if he
continues with these polices of barbarism towards the ethnic
community there he will get a punishment from the international
community," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
Blair noted that the world could not simply walk away from the
crisis by saying: "Quite apart from the humanitarian side of it.
There is the risk of conflict spreading and of huge and endemic
instability in the region."
</P>
<P>
Early Friday, British Defense Secretary George Robertson said
that NATO forces are in the final stages of planning and are
willing to do something about Yugoslavia's non-compliance with UN
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
However, British Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose, who
commanded U.N.troops in Bosnia in 1994 took a cautious position,
saying: "Air strikes by themselves are an emotional response, they
don't constitute a credible strategy."

<HEADLINE> Genetic Test May Suggest Heart Defect Gene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. researchers said blood
test may help doctors know which people with long QT syndrome are
at risk of dying from the heart disease, according to a report
from New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Wojciech Zareba and his colleagues from the University of
Rochester wrote on the Journal that three separate genetic defects
can cause this abnormality resulting in fainting or sudden death.
</P>
<P>
They found that two of the genetic defects are likely to result
in fainting, while the third is more apt to cause death.
</P>
<P>
They said they are developing a blood test that will tell
patients which of the three genes is causing their disease.
</P>
<P>
The researchers reached their conclusion by performing a study
on 541 people with long QT syndrome.
</P>
<P>
About 25000 Americans have long QT syndrome, about 3000 die
without warning each year.

<HEADLINE> Flooding in Liberia Leaves 5,000 Homeless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Flooding caused by heavy rains in
northwestern Liberia has forced more than 5,000 people to flee
their homes in recent weeks to escape the rising waters, a report
from Monrovia said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted rescue workers as saying that at least eight
people died in the floods and about 160 houses were washed away.
</P>
<P>
The worst of the flooding affected about 20 villages in Grand
Capemount County near the border with Sierra Leone, it said.
</P>
<P>
Liberia is still struggling to recover from eight years of
bloody civil war from 1989 to 1997, which has destroyed nearly
all social and economic infrastructures and driven tens of
thousands of people from their homes.
</P>
<P>
"We are in double trouble," said Tenneh Freeman, mayor of
Robertsports City. "After years of fighting, we are now facing
natural disasters."
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees, heavy rains throughout Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea
have halted the repatriation of tens of thousands of people
displaced by the conflicts in the region.

<HEADLINE> Greece's Warplanes to Participate in Cyprus' War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos announced here Friday that Greek aircraft will
participate in an annual military exercises later this month by
Cyprus' National Guard.
</P>
<P>
He made the announcement at the Larnaca Airport before his
departure after winding up his three-day visit to Cyprus, Cyprus
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
His announcement comes as the U.S. is trying to ease tensions
in Cyprus, calling on Cyprus to cancel its order for Russian
anti-aircraft missiles and on Greece and Turkey to agree to a
flight moratorium over the divided island.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Turkey has rejected the U.S. proposal while
Cyprus and its allied Greece insisted on an
internationally-guaranteed no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Turkish Cypriot-controlled north
and Greek Cypriot-dominated south since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus" in 1983, recognized only by their supporter
Turkey which is stationing 35,000 troops on the island.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunify the island
through a bi-communal formula, but the Turkish Cypriots opted out
of the peace talks last year to protest against a European Union
decision to begin membership talks with Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has warned that it will launch preemptive attacks to
prevent the deployment of the Russian-made missile on the island,
which fueled the tensions on the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Greece signed a joint defense pact in November
1993, which envisages that Greece will provide military assistance
if Cyprus is attacked.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos arrived here Wednesday for the celebration of
the 38th anniversary of the independence of the Cyprus Republic.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the people of Cyprus should feel vindicated after
Thursday's military parade which proved the effectiveness and
power of the Cyprus Republic's armed forces, which satisfies us."
</P>
<P>
This feeling, he noted, enables us to tackle political
challenges which affect the future of this island.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the talks with his Cypriot counterpart Yiannakis
Omirou, Tsohatzopoulos said they discussed cooperation on joint
military efforts and the creation of joint deterrent force.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief, Iraq's Aziz to Meet This Afternoon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan and Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz would hold
a one-hour meeting this afternoon, U.N. spokesman's office said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
This will be the second round of talks in this week between
Annan and Aziz on U.N. weapons inspection in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aziz is expected to give his decision to the U.N. chief on
whether or not to resume cooperation with the United Nations
Special Commission in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Some Arab ambassadors to the United Nations believe that Aziz
will say "yes" to Annan.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said on Thursday that the
Secretary-General had felt he and Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister
were making progress. But the spokesman declined to give any
details.
</P>
<P>
Aziz, who arrived here last weekend at the invitation of the
Secretary-General, has met nearly all the members of the Security
Council of the United Nations during the course of this week.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced to suspend cooperation with UNSCOM on August 5
after the talks between Aziz and UNSCOM's Executive Chairman
Richard Butler collapsed. The Security Council responded on
September 9 to Iraq's decision by suspending its periodic reviews
of sanctions against Iraq which has been in place since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Council also offered a new comprehensive review of its
compliance with relevant U.N. resolutions once Iraq reverses its
decision and resumes cooperation with UNSCOM.

<HEADLINE> Germany's SPD, Greens Agree on Job Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Social Democratic Party
(SPD) and the Greens, agreed at the start of their formal
coalition talks on Friday to introduce a program to create jobs
and training places for 100,000 young people immediately after
taking over power in Bonn late this month.
</P>
<P>
The SPD, which defeated Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative
alliance in the general election last Sunday, started the formal
negotiations with the Greens on Friday to form a possible
center-left ruling coalition, the first such one in Germany's
post-war history.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after four hours of negotiations in Bonn, both SPD
chairman Oskar Lafontaine and Juergen Trittin, a Greens leader,
described the talks as "constructive".
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine told reporters that the two sides agreed broadly on
a series of issues, but also differed on some points such as the
shutdown of nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
The two parties also mapped out a timetable for future
negotiations with the next round of talks scheduled for next
Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators now expect to wind up the talks as early as October
18. Should a coalition agreement be reached, both parties will
hold special conventions to approve it. The new parliament will
then hold its first session on October 26 and will formally elect
Gerhard Schroeder as chancellor the next day.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Ready for U.N.-Backed Process on Cyprus: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus government spokesman
Christos Stylianide said here Friday the Greek Cypriot side is
ready to engage at any given time in any process on the Cyprus
problem on the basis of U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides' words came in response to a U.N. proposal, which
encourage inter-communal contacts with a view to reducing tensions
on the island.
</P>
<P>
After separate meeting with Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash Wednesday, U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan proposed to develop a process "for on-island
contacts with both parties, with the goal of reducing tensions and
promoting progress toward a just and lasting settlement."
</P>
<P>
"As far as the reduction of tensions is concerned, we stick to
U.N. resolutions, whose basis is the bicommunal, bizonal federation
in line with the very important statement by the permanent members
of the U.N. Security Council," Stylianides said at his daily press
briefing.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Turkish Cypriot-controlled north
and Greek Cypriot-dominated south since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a breakaway state in
1983, which is recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunify the island
through a bi-communal formula, but Denktash, who walked out of the
peace negotiations last year, proposed in August the establishment
of a confederation of two equal states in Cyprus as the basis for
the resumption of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
But the proposal was rejected by the Cypriot government and the
U.N..
</P>
<P>
Tensions have been rising following Turkey's warning to launch
preemptive attacks to prevent the deployment of the Russian-made
anti-craft missiles on the island, which is due to be delivered
toward the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Stylianides said it was important to clarify which
issues these contacts will include.
</P>
<P>
"Matters referred to in U.N. resolutions 1178 and 1179 should
be on the agenda," he said.
</P>
<P>
Resolution 1178 calls on the parties to avoid any actions
which might increase tensions and resolution 1179 calls for a
reduction of foreign troops.
</P>
<P>
Turkey maintains 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides said that "we do not consider that talks on the
reduction of tension and security should deal exclusively with
the ongoing military dialog."
</P>
<P>
The dialog, conducted by the U.N. since 1996 with the Cyprus'
National Guard and the Turkish forces stationed in northern
Cyprus, aims to reach an agreement between the two sides to extend
unmaned army posts along the demarcation line, to remove loaded
weapons and define a code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the change in the text of a revised statement by
Annan Wednesday, which put Clerides and Denktash on an equal
footing, Stylianides stressed that "there is no doubt the
U.N. recognizes the Republic of Cyprus and its president, who
addressed the General Assembly according to the U.N. protocol."
</P>
<P>
But he said that the Cypriot government has made
representations and demarches about the change.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the original U.N. text referred to
identities of Clerides and Denktash as "the President of the
Republic of Cyprus Glafcos Clerides and the leader of the Turkish
Cypriot community Rauf Denktash."
</P>
<P>
The corrected version is "his excellency Mr Glafcos Clerides
and his excellency Mr Rauf Denktash."

<HEADLINE> UNITA Head of MPs Attacked by Unidentified Gunmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Leader of UNITA Parliamentary
Caucus Abel Chivukuvuku was fired at here Friday by unidentified
gunmen, but nobody was hurt, police said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
No one was killed or wounded in the incident Friday morning,
when the car of Chivukuvuku, a senior official of the former
opposition movement National Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) was fired at three times, the Angolan National
Police Headquarters said in its press release.
</P>
<P>
Just after 8 a.m., Chivukuvuku was leaving in a Daweoo Price
sedan his residence in Alvalade District together his wife when
two men 30 meters away opened fire from a car parked at the
roadside. One bullet hit the front part of Chivukuvuku's car and
the other two struck the right door, said the police.
</P>
<P>
Nobody could recognize the gunmen since they sped away
immediately after opening fire. And it is unclear who was behind
the attack.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan police were investigating the case and the United
Nations observer mission also sent a team to the scene.
</P>
<P>
Chivukuvuku fell out of favor with the Angolan government last
month over his refusal to join a UNITA splinter group, the UNITA
Renovation Committee on September 25, which is trying to oust
veteran guerrilla Jonas Savimbi as the leader of the movement.
</P>
<P>
He has also run afoul of Savimbi because he called on the
UNITA leadership to take decisive steps in a bid to salvage the
faltering peace process in Angola.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the Standing Committee of the People's
Assembly decided to dismiss from their position 15 UNITA MPs
including Chivukuvuku who had refused to break away with Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Chivukuvuku as leader of UNITA parliamentary caucus was
replaced by Engenio Manuvakola, one of the leaders of the UNITA
Renovation Committee and a former UNITA General Secretary.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1994 Lusaka Peace Protocol, the UNITA can
have 70 seats in Angolan People's Assembly. As the vast majority
of UNITA's 70 MPs have refused to join the Renovation Committee
which is backed by the Angolan government, its credibility is
seriously affected.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Rate Moves Higher in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. unemployment rate
picked up to 4.6 percent and job growth slumped to its lowest
level in nearly three years in September, the Labor Department
reported here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted rate, up from 4.5 percent during the
three previous months, was the highest in six months, according to
the department. It had hit a 28-year low of 4.3 percent in April
and May.
</P>
<P>
Employers added only 69,000 jobs to their payrolls last month,
down from 309,000 in August and the weakest figure since January
1996.
</P>
<P>
"The relatively weak September growth reflects an unusually
small increase in services and job losses in manufacturing and
construction," said Katharine G. Abraham, commissioner of the
Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers cut payrolls by 16,000 jobs in September, the
fifth decline in six months. During the period, factory employment
increased only in August, showing a rebound following the General
Motors nearly-two-month-long strikes. Over the past six months,
the sector has lost 152,000 jobs. Construction payrolls fell by
20,000 jobs, despite the fact the lowest interest rates in 30
years are supporting building. Much of the loss came in heavy
construction.
</P>
<P>
Jobs in the computer industry, engineering and health care
rose, but temporary help firms shed 44,000 positions. Retailers
added 37,000 jobs, about average.
</P>
<P>
Overall, services added just 24,000 jobs, about a fifth of the
average monthly gain recently, suggesting the impact of the global
slump in the United States may be starting to show up outside
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
In another sign of weakness, the average work week fell to 34.4
hours from 34.6 hours in August.
</P>
<P>
Average hourly earnings rose only 1 cent, to 12.86 dollars, but
that followed a strong 6-cent gain the month before and wages are
up 4
</P>
<P>
However, despite the deterioration, labor markets still are
strong by historical standards. The number of first-time claims
for unemployment benefits fell to a five-month low of 289,000 last
week.
</P>
<P>
The number of people working part time, who would prefer to
work full time, stood at 3.4 million in September, down by 563,000
over the past year, the Labor Department official said.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report today, the Commerce Department said orders
to factories rose 0.9 percent in August, reflecting recent rebound
in autos and a surge in aircraft. Excluding transportation, orders
fell 1.2 percent, the worst showing in three months.

<HEADLINE> UK to Put Four More Planes on Alert for Kosovo Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain announced Friday that it
was putting four more strike planes on alert for possible air
strikes against Serbian forces in Kosovo following two recent
massacres in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The British Ministry of Defense said that it was sending four
Harrier group attack planes to join four others already based with
NATO in southern Italy to "ensure that British aircraft are in
position to take part in military actions if required."
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, attending Labor Party
conference in Blackpool, called for immediate and strong
international response to the worsening Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
"For heaven's sake, let us get our act together now and give
him (Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic) the message that he
needs to be given."
</P>
<P>
"What is happening in Kosovo is entirely unacceptable and the
only way of stopping it is if President Milosevic knows that if he
continues with these polices of barbarism towards the ethnic
community there he will get a punishment from the international
community," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
Blair noted that the world could not simply walk away from the
crisis by saying: "Quite apart from the humanitarian side of it.
There is the risk of conflict spreading and of huge and endemic
instability in the region."
</P>
<P>
Early Friday, British Defense Secretary George Robertson said
that NATO forces are in the final stages of planning and are
willing to do something about Yugoslavia's non-copliance with UN
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
However, British Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose, who
commanded U.N.troops in Bosnia in 1994 took a cautious position,
saying: "Air strikes by themselves are an emotional response, they
don't constitute a credible strategy."

KAMPALA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Second Deputy Prime
Minister Moses Ali said Friday that the Ugandan government has no
ill feeling against the Muslim community.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when attending Juma prayers at Nakasero
Mosque as part of his campaign to explain to Muslims about the
situation in the country, Radio Uganda reported.
</P>
<P>
It is not the government's policy to arrest or detain
law-abiding Muslims but will not spare any who act against the
law, he said.
</P>
<P>
Also the Minister of Tourism, Trade and Industry, Moses Ali
advised communities of all religions to engage in development
activities.
</P>
<P>
When explaining Uganda's military presence in eastern Congo
(K), he described it as for preventive purposes.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Sulaiman Kakeeto, head of Tabliq sect, appealed to the
government not to make a blanket accusation that Muslims are
involved in the terrorist activities in the country. He also
called on all Muslims to work for maintaining peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
Many recent arrests in Uganda are related to Muslims, setting
afloat a rumor that Muslims are linked with the bombings and
other terrorist acts.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Russia Whips Up Pressure Against NATO Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Friday stepped up calls
for political settlement to the Kosovo crisis, with most branches
of power joining the chorus of objection to NATO airstrikes
against Serbia.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin, in a telephone conversation with
Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari, stressed that the Kosovo
problem must be solved with diplomatic methods and negotiations
between the Yugoslav authorities and the Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also instructed Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov to keep
him informed of the efforts aimed at a political settlement of the
Kosovo crisis, his spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who was Russia's foreign
minister three weeks ago, also reiterated Moscow's opposition to
the use of force over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
During a telephone conversation with his Italian counterpart,
Romano Prodi, Primakov said there was no way to solve the Kosovo
problem by force while any additional measures need a new decision
from the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Seleznyov, speaker of the State Duma, or lower house of
parliament, was one of the most fierce attacker of NATO's threat
of air strikes against Yugoslavian forces in Kosovo, where
increased violence has aroused worldwide attention.
</P>
<P>
"If a single bomb or rocket is dropped in Serbia, the
Yugoslavian army will provide a worthy retaliation and this can
trigger a full-scale war," Seleznyov warned.
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible for NATO to make a decision on bombings," he
said. "The problem of Kosovo must be resolved by the Yugoslavs
themselves."
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, the State Duma passed a resolution Kosovo,
stressing that any military strikes by NATO in circumvention of
the U.N. Security Council would be regarded as a "non-legal,
aggressive act."
</P>
<P>
In the latest flurry of efforts to avert military strikes
against Yugoslavia, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
telephoned his U.S., French and Italian counterparts on the
situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov "reaffirmed Russia's position with regard to the
unacceptability and counterproductiveness of any attempts to use
force in resolving the Kosovo problem," Foreign Ministry spokesman
Vladimir Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
"Implementation of NATO plans to this effect would have most
negative consequences and not only for the situation in the
Balkans," the Interfax quoted Ivanov as saying.
</P>
<P>
Both Belgrade and Pristina should take seriously the demands of
the international community for halting the confrontation
immediately, preventing a humanitarian crisis and beginning
political dialogue, he said.
</P>
<P>
"A peaceful life in Kosovo can be restored by this way alone,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov urged his counterparts to maintain unity in the U.N.
Security Council and in the Contact Group for continuing the
coordinated efforts towards a political settlement in Kosovo,
Rakhmanin said.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Response to Ethio-Eritrean Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Vice-Foreign
Minister Tekeda Alemu said Friday that "for a variety of reasons
the international response to the Ethio-Eritrean conflict has
been very unhelpful."
</P>
<P>
It had not been "conducive to the creation of conditions for
avoiding the deterioration of the situation," he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a panel discussion entitled "the Ethio-Eritrean
conflict and the international response" here, Tekeda said, "The
international community has not risen up to the challenge posed
by the Eritrean aggression against Ethiopia."
</P>
<P>
"It is now indisputable that the crisis between Ethiopia and
Eritrea is not the result of a dispute, but rather of an
aggression -- an aggression carried out by the Eritrean
authorities on Ethiopia on 12 May, 1998," he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, the vice-foreign minister said the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) has discharged its responsibilities honorably
under very difficult conditions.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the international community to put more pressure on
Eritrea to give peace a chance.
</P>
<P>
Teketa disclosed that an OAU Summit on Ethio-Eritrean conflict
would be held on October 15.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Ethiopian Vice-Justice Minister Mesfin Girma
said only those Eritreans who threaten national security were
expelled from Ethiopia. However, he added, Ethiopians in Eritrea
are subject to numerous sufferings.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats and representatives of international organizations
attended the panel discussion organized by the Press and
Information Department of the Ministry of Information and
Culture.

<HEADLINE> Greek FM Stresses Importance of Cyprus' EU Course </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos warned on Friday that any attempt to derail Cyprus from
joining the European Union (EU) would mean a re-examination of the
organization's entire enlargement process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a cabinet meeting, Pangalos criticized the
attempt by some EU partners to re-establish a link between the
course of Turkey's relations with the EU with Cyprus' course
towards EU membership.
</P>
<P>
This attempt was equivalent to backing out on the commitment to
expansion, he said, adding that if some wanted to revise
agreed-upon policies, they would have to bring everything to the
table.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in
the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The EU decided last year that Cyprus be included in its list of
countries waiting to join the group. Nicosia and Athens welcomed
the EU decision because they believed that this would help speed
up the settlement of the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, along with the Turkish Cypriots in northern Cyprus,
opposed the EU decision, saying that if Cyprus became a member of
the EU, it would annex northern Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Compliance Urged Over Three Indictees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council on
Friday called upon the Government of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (FRY) to cooperate with the International Criminal
Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia and implement relevant U.N.
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were contained in a statement read to the press by
Jeremy Greenstock, British Ambassador who is the president of the
Security Council for the month of October, following a Security
Council meeting over the Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that "members of the council deplored the
continuing non-compliance by the Belgrade authorities," which
refused to execute arrest warrants for the three indictees, who
are now reportedly living in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The obligation of the FRY under international law to enforce
the relevant Security Council resolutions and to cooperate with
the Tribunal was not open to question," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Friday, Judge Gabrielle Kirk Mcdonald, president of
the International Criminal Tribunal, briefed the Security Council
on the work of the Tribunal, including the refusal of the FRY
Government to execute arrest warrants for the three indictees.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Security Council, Mcdonald said, "I am
here today to request the Security Council to adopt effective
measures to ensure there is immediate compliance by the FRY with
its obligations under international law."
</P>
<P>
The 15 Security Council members "expressed their full support
for Judge Mcdonald and for the work of the Tribunal in
implementing its mandate," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council reaffirmed the authority and jurisdiction
of the International Tribunal over the matters within its
competence throughout the territory of the former Yugoslavia,"
the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after her briefing at the Security Council, Judge
Mcdonald told the press here that "I want to remind leaders of the
FRY that their obligation is long overdue."
</P>
<P>
Judge Mcdonald, a native of the United States, was elected by
the United Nations General Assembly as a judge of the
International Tribunal in September 1993 and re-elected in May
1997 for a second four-year term.
</P>
<P>
In resolution 827, which stipulates the creation of the
International Tribunal, the Security Council directed all
countries to take any measures necessary under their domestic
law to implement the provisions of the resolution and the
Statute of the Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the Dayton Agreement requires all signatories to
cooperate with the Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
"However, the FRY stands alone as the only signatory to the
Dayton Agreement which has failed to adopt legislation to
facilitate cooperation," Mcdonald said.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho to Hold New Elections Within 18 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho, which was in
turmoil for the past two months because of allegations of fraud
in May 23 elections, will hold a new general election within
15-18 months, South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
In a special televised speech, Mbeki said the new poll was
agreed on by the Sesotho government and opposition party alliance
in the mountain kingdom during peace talks brokered by Southern
African Development Community (SADC) mediators in Maseru,
Lesotho, earlier on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy led by Prime
Minister Pakalitha Mosisili would govern until the elections were
held, and Lesotho's independent electoral commission would be
reconstituted and strengthened, Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations would continue on other measures that might be
necessary to ensure the forthcoming elections to be free and
fair, and that all political parties participating in the poll
had a level playing field.
</P>
<P>
He said the SADC would maintain a security presence in Lesotho
until it was determined that the Sesotho security forces were
able to discharge their legal and constitutional roles
effectively.
</P>
<P>
"All (Lesotho) parties in the dispute, including the
opposition parties, will cooperate with the SADC in this regard,"
Mbeki said, noting the agreement laid a firm basis for Lesotho's
return to normality.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said the South African government was pleased with the
outcome of Friday's multi-party talks in Maseru.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to congratulate all participants at this
meeting for the constructive manner in which they approached the
challenge of speedily resolving the problem facing the people of
Lesotho," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The decision by the
European Union (EU) to begin membership talks with the Greek
Cypriot government undermined the political settlement to the
divided Cyprus, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash said here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Denktash said "EU entry for
Cyprus is illegal until a political solution has been reached. The
world would have to recognize that the Greek Cypriot government
did not represent or rule the whole of Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
"They have no right to be the government of Turkish Cypriots or
to colonize Turkish Cypriots," he said.
</P>
<P>
Denktash said he refused to discuss a political solution for
Cyprus until his government was recognized as the legitimate
representative of the Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
EU has agreed to open membership talks with 10 East European
nations and Cyprus with a view to bringing them into EU over the
next decade.
</P>

Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south
and a Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's National Fund
Soliciting Committee announced Friday that over 100 million
Birr (14 million U.S. Dollars) is needed to assist war-displaced
Ethiopians and Ethiopians expelled from Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Simon Mechale, chairman of the committee, said the committee
has so far received 72 million Birr (10.1 million Dollars) of the
total sum pledged by Ethiopians from home and abroad, the
Ethiopian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Over 213,000 Ethiopians displaced by the Ethi-Eritrean war and
expelled from Eritrea are sheltered in eight regions, said Simon,
adding that 50,000 more are expected to return home from Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
He commended the support extended so far and called on
Ethiopians and the international community to continue with the
assistance.
</P>
<P>
Some 24,970 Ethiopians were expelled from Eritrea and 188,690

<HEADLINE> Clinton Hopes Belgrade Gets Message on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Friday he hoped Yugoslavia got the message that the West
is prepared for military strikes unless he stops violence against
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We have to be very, very strong here," Clinton told reporters
at a news conference on U.S. and world economy. "We need to stop
the violence, get a negotiated settlement, and work our way
through this."
</P>
<P>
"We don't want thousands upon thousands of people to be caught
up in a war or to starve or freeze this winter because they have
been displaced. And we are working very, very hard on it," Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
Washington is pushing for a diplomatic solution but has made
clear that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is ready
to act if no negotiated settlement is reached.
</P>
<P>
"We have been working for months and months -- I have
personally been working for months -- first of all, to get NATO
and then to get the U.N. to send a message to Mr. Milosevic to
stop the violence," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton indicated he believed there would be a consensus among
NATO's 16 members on the use of force, however, to stop the crisis
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that our allies in Europe are with us and I think
that we all understand and we hope he (Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic) got the message," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council last week adopted a resolution
calling for an immediate ceasefire. U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan has been asked to speed completion of a report on
Milosevic's compliance with U.N. demands on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
NATO wants the report before it makes a decision on further
action, possibly next Wednesday, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the threat of force may be what it takes to get
Milosevic to rein in his forces, saying the same was needed in the
Bosnian conflict.
</P>
<P>
"We saw in Bosnia what works in dealing with Mr. Milosevic," he
said. "We cannot allow this conflict to spread again and risk
what we stopped in Bosnia starting again in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that situation in Kosovo is different from
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"The Kosovo situation is somewhat different, in that Kosovo is
actually a part of Serbia, although by law it's supposed to be
autonomous," Clinton said.

TIRANA, October 2 (Xinhua) - Albanian Prime Minister Pandeli
Majko presented Friday before reporters the new cabinet and the
priorities of its program.
</P>
<P>
In a brief news conference PM Majko said that "after
relatively long negotiations with the government coalition
parties, today the President decreed the composition of the new
government," and he read the names of the members of the
executive, who are 17, two of whom are Ermelinda Meksi, Minister
of Foreign Economic Cooperation (SP) and Ingrid Shuli, Minister of
Public Works and Transport (SDP.)
</P>
<P>
Then PM Pandeli Majko declared that after the oath ceremony
before President Meidani is made, today the new government will
start immediately its work to implement the already declared
priorities to bring normality, public order and tranquillity to
the country, to start the process of dialogue with the opposition
and to cooperate in the process for the approval of the
constitution along with the joint efforts with the International
Community for the solution of the question of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Determining the priorities of the new cabinet, PM Majko said
that "stability of the country will be one of the main tasks of
the government which will overcome any obstacle in order to bring
peace to the people." Referring to the issue of Kosovo, PM Majko
said that "our approach for this problem, also in close
cooperation with international partners, will be very soon an
immediate response towards Serb massacres against the Albanians of
Kosovo."

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Panel Releases More Scandal Material </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The Judiciary Committee of
the the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee on
Friday released another batch of evidence in the White House
sex-and-perjury scandal.
</P>
<P>
Some 4,600 pages of grand jury testimony, FBI interviews and
transcripts of Linda Tripp's secretly recorded talks with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky about Lewinsky's affair with
U.S. President Bill Clinton were made public.
</P>
<P>
It was the last large batch of evidence to be made public in
the case, after last week's release of Clinton's videotaped grand
jury testimony and the earlier release of independent counsel
Kenneth Starr's 445-page report alleging 11 impeachable offenses
by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The White House was quick to criticize the release. Press
Secretary Joe Lockhart called the disclosures "the clearest
indication that this is a partisan process designed for partisan
gain rather than a solid constitutional process designed to do the
work that framers of the Constitution envisioned."
</P>
<P>
Tripp's tape recordings of Lewinsky's tales of an affair with
the president triggered Starr's investigation into the White House
sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
Both sides had said there were no new bombshells in the
material. Tripp's conversations were expected to show her
manipulating the younger Lewinsky and egging her on in her affair
with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The committee will meet on Monday to consider launching the
first formal impeachment inquiry against a president since the
1974 investigation of President Richard Nixon's Watergate scandal,
and only the third in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, a Republican, has proposed a
resolution of inquiry that closely follows the Watergate model,
allowing a broad open-ended investigation but giving Democrats
power to subpoena witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Republicans said they should be free to pursue other possible
areas of inquiry, including campaign finance abuses or the
Whitewater, FBI file and White House travel office controversies
investigated by Starr but not included in his referral to Congress
last month.
</P>
<P>
But Democrats on Friday proposed restricting the investigation
to the Lewinsky matter and setting a time limit of November 25 to
complete the inquiry and any subsequent House action.
</P>
<P>
Under the Democrats' proposal, the committee would determine a
constitutional standard for impeachment before deciding if any of
the allegations against Clinton met that standard.
</P>
<P>
By October 26, the committee would begin any formal inquiry and
conclude it within a month. Representative John Conyers, ranking
Democrat on the committee, said an open-ended inquiry would be a
"politicized fishing expedition of enormous expense."
</P>
<P>
But Republicans said putting a time limit on the inquiry was an
invitation to delays and stalling.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans, who control the committee, are certain to push
through their resolution, but a Democratic alternative would give
nervous Democrats a way to oppose a formal inquiry without facing
election-year attacks they ignored evidence of possible
impeachable offenses.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- An estimated 155,000 gallons
of oil leaked from an American exploration underwater pipeline in
the Gulf of Mexico, the Associated Press reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The leak, at BP Exploration's Mississippi Canyon 109 platform,
left a slick about 50 kilometers from the mouth of the Mississippi
River. The pipeline shut off automatically, the company said.
</P>
<P>
The leak was discovered late Thursday. The size of the slick
and the potential damage for environment were not immediately
determined.
</P>
<P>
The company was to fly a plane over the spill and has
dispatched a remotely operated underwater vessel to examine the
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
A ship designed to recover spilled oil was en route by the
Marine Spill Response Corp. The ship is capable of recovering
10,000 barrels of oil a day.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, a spill was found in the Pacific off San
Francisco. The spill near a national marine sanctuary caused birds
deaths.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho's Opposition Denies Agreement Reached in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho opposition party
alliance denied South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's
announcement Friday night that rival parties in the mountain
kingdom had reached an agreement that would normalize the
country.
</P>
<P>
Mamelo Morrison, spokeswoman for the Lesotho opposition
alliance, claimed in an interview with the South African Press
Association (SAPA) that Mbeki had deceived the world.
</P>
<P>
"What your deputy president said was a lie... We have not come
anywhere near agreement. This has just put the whole negotiation
into chaos," SAPA quoted Morrison as saying.
</P>
<P>
Morrison said there was "tentative agreement" on some issue,
including the holding of elections within 18 months, and that the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) would maintain
security presence in Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
However, all of this hinged on a major issue -- the
administrative mechanism necessary to ensure that elections could
take place, which had yet to be agreed to in the multi-party
talks started Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The first face-to-face talks between the Sesotho government
and opposition parties since August was chaired by South African
Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi.
</P>
<P>
Morrison said opposition party leaders were conferring among
themselves on the way forward and wheth to continue with
negotiations. A statement would be made to public on the matter,
she added.

<HEADLINE> Primitive Fish Coelacanth found in Sulawesi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. biologist reported in
British science journal Nature recently that the so-called "living
fossil" fish known as coelacanth was found in July in waters of
northern Sulawesi, Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that this rare and primitive fish was
found since the first discovery made in 1938 in waters around the
Comoro Islands off the coast of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mark Erdmann, a biologist with the University of California at
Berkeley, wrote that in July fishmen in Sulawesi waters caught the
coelacanth and brought it to his home. Before the finding, Erdmann
fist discovered a dead coelacanth a year ago at the local fish
market.
</P>
<P>
Coelacanth, generally about five feet long with paddlelike tails
and weighing more than 60 pounds, are thought to be originated to
the dinosaur era and endangered long ago. Although Sulawesi is
6,250 miles away from the Comoro Islands, some experts say the
fish seems to be the same species found on the opposite side of the
Indian Ocean in the Comoro Islands, but the final conclusion can
only be made until they compared their DNA.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Declares Election Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard claimed Saturday night that his coalition would have a
working majority in the new parliament although the final result
in terms of seats has not been declared yet.
</P>
<P>
"Although the final result in terms of seats will not be
determined for some days yet, it is clear the coalition will have
a working majority in the new parliament," Howard told his
jubilant supporters in Sydney Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the coalition has won 70 seats, five short of the
minimum 75 majority to win the election while the opposition Labor
Party got 64 seats, with 13 undecided.
</P>
<P>
"I want, first and foremost, to thank the Australian people for
the returning of the government," Howard said in a televised
speech on an Australian Broadcasting Corporation program.
</P>
<P>
"I want to thank the Australian people for embracing a bold
economic reform (plan his coalition proposed just before the
election), but is in the long-term interest of the Australian
community."
</P>
<P>
"I regard it as a privilege beyond belief to have been twice
elected as prime minister of Australia," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
Howard lost no chance to attack his arch-rival Kim Beazley over
Beazley's remarks earlier Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
According to initial election results, Beazley's Australian
Labor Party almost ousted Howard's government in this federal
election,
</P>
<P>
About half an hour before Howard's speech, Beazley publicly
admitted it was difficult to win the election.
</P>
<P>
"While I don't want to formally concede defeat tonight I do
have to tell you it would be difficult for us to reach a majority
position from that position (the number of seats the party has won
so far)," Beazley told his applauding supporters.
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest (number of) seats won by the first term
opposition party in this country ever. This is the biggest swing
to the first time opposition party since World War II," he added,
referring to the large number of seats the Labor Party won back.
</P>
<P>
Howard took a swipe at Beazley over his speech.
</P>
<P>
"Some declarations about political precedents have been made
tonight. Let me make a declaration about political precedents:
This is probably the first time in the recent experience of
Western political parties that a party has successfully won an
election championing such a major reform which so readily lent
itself to a dishonest campaign," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
The Howard government released its sweeping tax reform plan two
weeks before the election campaign in a bid to transform the
nation's 60-year-old tax system into business-friendly one. But
the Labor Party has run a fear campaign against the proposed tax
reform plan saying it would push up the inflation rate and living
costs.
</P>
<P>
"We have weathered the ferocious fear campaign and we have won
the mandate from the Australian people."
</P>
<P>
"I am immensely proud of the fact that the coalition stuck to
its guns. We stared down that fear campaign and the Australian
people came with us."
</P>
<P>
Howard said he had always seen himself in public life as the
servant of the Australian people.
</P>
<P>
He promised to govern for all Australians into the next
century.
</P>
<P>
"The government you have elected tonight will lead this country
into the 21st century," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a conciliatory gesture to the nation's 300,000 Aborigines,
Howard recommitted himself to reconciliation with Australia's
Aboriginal people by the centenary of federation, January 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
"We may differ in debate about the best way of achieving
reconciliation but I think all Australians are united today in a
determination to achieve it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Howard has been criticized for his handling of issues
concerning the Aboriginal people before and during the election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Before Saturday's election, the coalition held 91 lower house
seats, while the number of low house seats held by the opposition
Labor Party was 49.

<HEADLINE> Mongolian President Holds Meeting over Assassination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian President Nachagyn
Bagabandy on Saturday summoned the National Security Council for
an emergency meeting following the assassination of Minister of
Infrastructure and Telecommunications Sanjaasuregijn Zorig.
</P>
<P>
The Montsame News Agency reported that the president has
instructed Acting Prime Minister Tsakhya Elbegdorj to take
measures to capture the killers and bring them to justice soon.
</P>
<P>
Zorig was assassinated at home Friday night and died after two
outlaws, a man and a woman, stabbed him 18 times with daggers, a
TV report quoted the police as saying.
</P>
<P>
The two attackers fled the scene with more than 300
U.S. dollars, 15,000 Tughriks (about 19.11 dollars) and a gold
ring, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The assassination occurred as the political situation remained
deadlocked with President Bagabandy rejecting all nominations for
premiership since the dissolution of the Mongolian government on
July 24.
</P>
<P>
The political crisis in the country dates back in May when the
government decided to merge the state-owned Renovation Bank with
the private Golomt Bank, deemed illegal by the main opposition
Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP).
</P>
<P>
The then Prime Minister Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj resigned with his
entire cabinet on July 24 after an eight-week boycott of
parliament by MPRP.
</P>
<P>
Zorig, 36, had been a member of the General Committee of the
Mongolian National Democratic Party since 1992. From 1992 to 1996,
he served as a member of the Great Hural (parliament). In July
1996, he was re-elected member of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Zorig was a potential candidate for prime minister and the
killing was believed to be politically motivated, said an official
source.

<HEADLINE> Coal Miners to Lift Picket of Government House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Coal miners decided Saturday to
end a round-the-clock picket of more than three months near the
House of the Russian Government.
</P>
<P>
The decision, reached by the Executive Committee of the Coal
Miners' Independent Trade Union, was to allow Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov's Cabinet to implement the reached agreements and
rectify the situation in the country, said Alexander Sergeyev,
chairman of the trade union.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, the former foreign minister, was subsequently
nominated premier and cleared the State Duma rather easily, ending
a government crisis that paralyzed the country amid an economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Executive Committee of the Coal Miners'
Independent Trade Union demands that Primakov "fight corruption."
</P>
<P>
It described Primakov as "probably the only person capable of
achieving it."
</P>
<P>
"A chance to pull Russia out of the crisis will appear when the
unpunished robbery of the country is stopped," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The government must "do everything possible to prevent
uncontrolable social shocks. The personal role of every top
official and oligarch in the economic collapse must be determined.
The part of the population which has lost the means for existence
must be protected," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Communities Urged to Cooperate in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. has urged the rival
Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus to cooperate in the
U.N.-proposed dialogs to help solve the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Telling a news conference here Saturday, U.N. Resident
Representative in Cyprus, Dame Ann Hercus was explaining
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's recent initiative to "develop
a process for on-island contacts with both parties," which she
interpreted as making "shuttle talks."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunify the divided
island through a bi-communal formula, but peace talks collapsed as
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash walked out of the peace talks
last year.
</P>
<P>
Hercus said she intends to invite some countries, particularly
the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, to play a role
in the process.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official refrained from disclosing anything concerning
the agenda, stating simply that "any lasting settlement for Cyprus
would address all the issues that matter."
</P>
<P>
She stressed, however, that she has no comment on what might be
decided and that there is no intention "at this early stage of the
process to give consideration to how and when there might be joint
meetings."
</P>
<P>
"My view, which I hold very strongly," she said, is that "the
process ought to be done well, not fast."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Turkish Cypriot-controlled north
and Greek Cypriot-dominated south since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a breakaway state
in north in 1983, which is recognized only by Turkey.

NEW DELHI, October 3 (Xinhua) -- More than 9,000 commercial

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Enjoys High Degree of Autonomy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 3 (Xinhua) -- "The Central People's
Government has granted us a high degree of autonomy -- a situation
that is unparalleled anywhere in the world," Tung Chee Hwa, chief
executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)
says.
</P>
<P>
July 1, 1997 saw Hong Kong's smooth return to
China. Developments since its return fully demonstrate that the
central government has strictly adhered to its policies on Hong
Kong -- "one country, two systems", "Hong Kong people
administering Hong Kong" and a high degree of autonomy for Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Since the HKSAR was established a year ago, not a single
official has been sent by the central government to the SAR
government, which was formed in accordance with relevant
stipulations of the Basic Law, a mini-constitution of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The legal system previously in force in Hong Kong has continued
after the handover to ensure the rule of law and the independence
of the judiciary, a cornerstone of Hong Kong's success. The
ultimate appeal court, the Court of Final Appeal, was established
in Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, and since then has heard its first
cases.
</P>
<P>
The media continues to question and criticize government
decisions with as much vigor and openness as before the handover;
political protests remain alive, with an average of 140 a week
during the HKSAR's first ten months; and people still enjoy
freedom of speech, of association, of religious belief and of
movement in and out of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the public can be assured that Hong Kong continues
to be one of the safest and most stable cities in the world," says
Lau Yuk-kuen, senior assistant commissioner of police.
</P>
<P>
On law and order, the overall crime situation in Hong Kong has
remained largely stable with fewer offenses being recorded in the
12 months following Hong Kong's return. Compared with pre-handover
12 months, the total number of crimes recorded in the
post-handover 12 months dropped by 7.6 percent to 66,908 cases,
with violent crimes falling by 4.4 percent.

<P>
Hong Kong's economy has been hit by fallout from the Asian
financial crisis. But with its economic strengths, it will ride
out the storm.
</P>
<P>
In this time of economic difficulty, Hong Kong's GDP has
shrunk, unemployment risen, stocks tumbled, property prices
plunged, and tourism declined.
</P>
<P>
Tung and his administration have taken bold initiatives to
relieve people's hardship and revive its economy. The SAR's first
budget of 1998 proposed tax cuts for 99 percent of taxpayers and
incentives for individuals and businesses.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government also announced a multi-billion HK dollar
package aimed at stimulating the economy by easing credit,
stabilizing property prices, reducing cost burdens, and restoring
public confidence.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, the government will invest more than 30
million U.S. dollars on a number of massive infrastructure
projects to strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong in the
long run, and create more job opportunities in the short run.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the biggest overseas investor in the Chinese
mainland, and the mainland is the second largest trading partner of
Hong Kong. Today, one out of four tourists arriving in Hong Kong
comes from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong and neighboring Guangdong Province in south China
have set up a high-powered cooperative conference to co-ordinate
policy and action on a range of issues including trade,
infrastructure development, transport links and passenger flows.
</P>
<P>
Many believe that Hong Kong has the strengths to ride out the
economic storm in southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong continues to be a most attractive place for the
European business community as it remains a haven of stability in
a region in turmoil and plays a invaluable role as a regional hub
and a bridge to the mainland." says Etienne Reuter, head of
office, the European Commission.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Spend Million Drs on Corridor Disease  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
staked two billion Kwacha (about one million U.S. Dollars) to
president Frederick Chiluba has announced.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Saturday quoted the president as saying Friday
in Choma, capital of the province, that the funds will be handled
through a Southern province disease control revolving fund to
fight this special disease on cattle in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He told a gathering that out of the funds 1.5 billion Kwacha
(about 750,000 Dollars) will be spent on infrastructure
rehabilitation, sinking bor-holes and construction of dip
tanks, and procurement of dipping chemicals and drugs.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 500 million Kwacha will be used to produce a
corridor disease vaccine and soft loans to farmers, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called for proper use of the money, saying, "people in
Eastern, Central, Northern, Western and Luapula provinces, all
want the same assistance. But you can only spend money at a time.
But if you don't use the money properly, I will never give you
any more."
</P>
<P>
He said that of the 1.1 million head of cattle living in the
province in 1996, only 700,000 remain because of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The loss of cattle by many small scale farmers has rendered
most of them incapable to prepare their fields for planting, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba urged those with tractors to assist in tilling the
land free of charge and promised to reward all those who will do
the service.

<HEADLINE> Primakov Calls for Foreign Investment in Production Sectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov on Saturday urged foreign companies to invest in
Russia's real production sectors to help it stave off an economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with senior representatives of major Western
companies investing in the country's production sectors, Primakov
reassured them that the government will reduce rather than
increase the tax burden on producers, Economy Minister Andrei
Shapovalyants told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied with the discussion, and we hope the
investors have received the new information about the government's
plan of action to bring the country out of the crisis," the
Interfax news agency quoted Shapovalyants as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government sees such meetings as very important
because they are concerned about long-term investments in the real
production sector rather than short-term investments, he said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov and the businessmen also discussed the need for
transparency in Russian companies' audits and accounting
statements and other major terms for the operation of companies in
the country, Shapovalyants said.
</P>
<P>
Task forces will be created within the Consultative Council on
Foreign Investments in Russia to prepare proposals on Russia's
legislation and protection of investments, Shapovalyants said.
</P>
<P>
earnest and Young Chief Executive Director Michael Henning told
reporters after the meeting that the foreign businessmen did not
receive any new information at the meeting,
</P>
<P>
Russia, with its rich human and natural resources, needs to
make radical changes to its tax, banking and other laws to
facilitate the influx of more foreign investment, Henning said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said that foreign investors were "the force" that will
allow Russia to minimize its losses from the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We are very much interested in foreign investments," he
said. "We need a continuous dialogue with foreign investors,
without whom it will be hard for us to overcome the current
difficulties."
</P>
<P>
He complained that "foreign capital has been coming to the
country via short-term operations" for a long time but "not to our
liking or to yours."
</P>
<P>
Primakov called for long-term rather than speculative
investments in Russia, noting that long-run investment can ensure
real returns.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Primakov reiterated the government's denial
over reported plans to ban the free circulation of U.S. dollars in
the country and curtail privatization, describing such allegations
as "delirium."
</P>
<P>
The inflow of dollars into Russia will not be restricted, but
the government will control the outflow of foreign exchange, he
said.

CANBERRA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard said Saturday night that his coalition would have a working
majority in the new parliament although the final election result
in terms of seats would not be determined for some days yet.
</P>
<P>
"I want, first and foremost, to thank the Australian people for
the returning of the government," he told applauding supporters in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Howard's first post-election speech was broadcast live on the

So far, the coalition has won 70 seats, five short of the
minimum 75 majority to win the election while the opposition Labor

<HEADLINE> China Forms Modern Enterprise System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Significant success has been
achieved in the extremely difficult and complicated reform of
state-owned industrial enterprises, according to the State
Statistics Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
A recent SSB report indicates that state-owned enterprises will
continue to play a dominant role in China's industrial sector and
to grow in spite of the decline in their proportion
of the nation's total output value. The report shows the
proportion related enterprises contributed to total national
output fell from 77.6 percent in the late 1970s to 26.5 percent in
1997.
</P>
<P>
State-owned enterprises play a decisive role and account for
some 70 percent of enterprises in the crucial sectors of the
national economy such as in the coal, petroleum, power and water
supply industries.
</P>
<P>
The SSB report indicates that China will maintain a 1998
economic growth rate well above seven percent. The report also
indicates that further reform measures will promote the transition
to a modern enterprise system.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a new enterprise system, the most crucial
aspect of reform, was implemented in 1994 when the State Council
introduced a modern enterprise system based on 100 medium- to
large-sized enterprises. Smaller enterprises were also granted
decision-making powers to facilitate their entry into the
market.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,600 state-owned enterprises had participated in the
establishment of modern enterprise system by the end of 1997,
including 1,562 medium- to large-sized industrial enterprises
with some 33 percent of total assets in the state-owned
sector.
</P>
<P>
The central government has also encouraged large state-owned
enterprises to form conglomerates in order to strengthen their
competitiveness, with some 120 enterprises selected to participate
in the effort.
</P>
<P>
The SSB report notes that China's state-owned enterprises
continue to should irrationally heavy economic and social
burdens. However, the report projects future success as both
management and staff adapt to reforms.

diplomatic sources disclosed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government on Tuesday first ordered a senior
diplomat at the Pakistani High Commission in New Delhi to leave

sources said.
</P>
<P>
The name of the Pakistani official however was not given.

In a usual tit-for-tat response, Pakistan ordered an Indian

<P>
According to a report by the News Network International, the
Pakistani Foreign 0ffice spokesman, Tariq Altaf, did not deny the

The sources further said both countries had agreed not to
disclose the incident before the forthcoming foreign secretary
level talks scheduled to resume in Islamabad on October 15.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Hold Maneuvers Directed at Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Defense Minister Ismet
Sezgin said on Saturday that Turkey will hold military maneuvers
in the Mediterranean near Syria as tension is mounting between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We have warned Syria not to allow terrorism to become state
policy. It is unacceptable within the framework of friendly
relations and principles of democracy," Turkey's semi-official
Anatolia News Agency quoted Sezgin as saying while announcing the
news.
</P>
<P>
Turkey accuses Syria of harboring militants of its outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party, which has been fighting since 1984 for an
independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey. Syria has denied
the charge.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear for every one that Syria does not give up her
stubborn manner (in supporting the Kurdish rebels). Patience (of
Turkey) has a limit," Sezgin said.
</P>
<P>
While offering to solve the problems through diplomacy, he said
"the diplomacy is over at one point. In that case we will do what
is necessary."
</P>
<P>
On the military flights over the border region with Syria,
Sezgin said that "some units of the Turkish Armed Forces hold
training activities in that region."
</P>
<P>
A Turkish informed source speaking on condition of anonymity
confirmed on Saturday that Turkey has massed troops backed by
tanks and heavy artillery to the border areas.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said on Thursday that
despite Turkey's repeated warnings and peaceful initiatives, Syria
is trying to provoke the Arab world against Ankara by using
Turkey's close ties with Israel as a pretext.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a friendly attitude. I declare to the world that
our patience is running out and we retain the right to retaliate
against Syria," Demirel said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey enjoys close ties with Israel by carrying out a number
of agreements on military training and defense.
</P>
<P>
Syria said the Turkish-Israeli alliance is targeted against the
Arab world, especially itself, accusing Turkey of betraying the
interests of the Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Syria has disputes with Israel over the future of the Golan
Heights captured by the Israel in the 1967 Mideast War.

<P>
CANBERRA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard's coalition is almost certain to win Saturday's federal
election, as its arch-rival Kim Beazley publicly admitted it was
difficult to win the election.
</P>
<P>
"While I don't want to formally concede defeat tonight I do
have to tell you it would be difficult for us to reach a majority
position from that position (the number of seats the party has won
so far)," a smiling Beazley told applauding supporters.
</P>
<P>
He was shown on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)
saying the Labor Party appeared to win at least 70 seats Saturday
night with 12 seats undecided.
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest (number of) seats won by the first term
opposition party in this country ever," Beazley said.
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest swing to the first time opposition party
since World War II," he added.
</P>
<P>
Before Saturday's election, the coalition held 91 lower house
seats while the number of low house seats held by the opposition
Labor Party was 49.

<HEADLINE> China's Long March into Space Gains Pace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- March 26, 1998 was hailed as
a milestone event in Chinese aerospace technology when a Long
March 2C/SD rocket blasted off its launch pad at the Taiyuan
satellite center and carried two iridium satellites owned by
Motorola into accurate orbit. It was the 50th launch of a Long
March series rocket.
</P>
<P>
The 50 launches have taken place over a 28-year-long period
during which occasional setbacks have been overcome to record an
88 percent success rate for Long March launches.
</P>
<P>
China's aerospace technology developed from the mid 1950s on
the back of missile ballistics research. On April 24, 1970 LM-1
sent the Dongfanghong No.1 satellite into orbit, marking
tentative first steps in China's long march to develop its own
space technology.
</P>
<P>
On November 26, 1975, China successfully launched its LM-2
rocket and sent the country's first retrievable satellite into
space. This made China the third nation in the world capable of
retrievals and remote-sensing technology.
</P>
<P>
China's ascent to maturity in carrier-rocket technology was
completed in the early 1990s with the successful launch of 11
recoverable satellites into space by LM-2C rockets, an improved
model on the LM-2 rocket.
</P>
<P>
Collectively, the 11 satellites obtained a wealth of
high-resolution images from which valuable and varied information
was gleaned by specialists in many disciplines including petroleum
geology, land surveying, civil engineering, seismology and
archaeology.
</P>
<P>
China has also launched a series of communications satellites,
meteorological satellites and various scientific experimental
satellites into space. With these successes the country
effectively leapfrogged several intermediate stages of sector
development to provide advanced telecom, data and image transmission
and TV broadcasting relays.
</P>
<P>
At present, China has put eight of its nine types of rocket
into international commercial service. They are capable of
launching satellites into low-earth orbits, solar-synchronous and
geo-synchronous transfer orbits.
</P>
<P>
By the end of May this year China had made 19 commercial
launches for overseas customers and provided piggyback services on
five occasions. By providing these services, the country has not
only strengthened its position technologically, but also given the
world's communications industry an alternative service for
satellite launches.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Confirms Withdrawal of Iran's Embassy Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan confirmed on Saturday
that Iran had sent home some of its non-essential embassy staff
and their families for a temporary period for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to show our understanding and respect for their
decision," Foreign Office spokesman Tariq Altaf told a weekly
press briefing here.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the Pakistani Embassy in Tehran including the
Embassy School are functioning normally.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question, Altaf made it clear that Pakistan
would not withdraw its embassy staff from Iran and expressed the
hope that Iran would ensure their security "in line with their
duties."
</P>
<P>
The Frontier Post, an English daily, reported Friday that Iran
had pulled more than 60 functionaries out of its embassy in
Islamabad, including nine senior diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmud Mohammadi said in
Tehran Thursday that the staff had been withdrawn due to "certain
problems," which he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian spokesman insisted that there was no
change in the state of relations between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> China's Long March into Space Gains Pace (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the course of launching satellites from around the world,
China has constantly improved its carrier-rocket technology and
continuously raised the load-bearing capacity of its
vehicles. Adapting itself to the needs of the international
market, China has developed a series of key technologies, such as
cluster technology, hydrogen-oxygen motor technology and a
technology to launch several satellites with one rocket.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, solid fuel motors used for changing orbits at
near earth point and satellite distributors for launching iridium
satellites have been successfully developed.
</P>
<P>
Three main rocket models have been developed in the course of
executing commercial launches, in line with special customer
requirements. They include the powerful LM-3B rocket with four
liquid boosters and the LM2C/SD rocket for launching low-earth
orbit satellites.
</P>
<P>
The availability of China's commercial carrier rocket service
has been welcomed by foreign clients in the industry, despite some
setbacks.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, China has established business links or
aerospace-technology exchanges with 70 countries and regions,
including the United States, France, Germany and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The low- and medium-orbit satellite network is a growing
market. Over the next eight years, from 1998 to 2006, it is
estimated that some 236 geo-synchronous satellites and more than
730 medium- and low-orbit satellites will need to be launched.
</P>
<P>
In line with a contract signed with Motorola in April 1993,
China will continue to use Long March 2C rockets to launch 16
iridium satellites for the US telecom giant. More will be launched
later this year.
</P>
<P>
Recently, China has joined several Asian nations in developing
a satellite system to provide mobile telecom services for as many
as 1.3 billion people. Total investment in the Asian-Pacific
Mobile Telecommunications Satellite System is expected to be 650
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Despite these various successes, China's carrier rocket
technology still lags behind some countries in terms of
launch-success ratio.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jiyuan, president of China Aerospace Corporation
(CAC), said,"We'll keep on improving the carrying capacity and
reliability of the Long March series rockets, focus on developing
communications satellites, meteorological satellites and resource
satellites and execute our manned space program."
</P>
<P>
By 2000 China hopes to have launched 30 more satellites for
overseas users, improving the success rate of its launches to an
impressive 95 percent.

<HEADLINE> Possibly Mislabeled Vaccines Behind Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Possibly mislabeled vaccines may
have caused the hospitalization of hundreds of Jordanian students
early this week, the Jordan Times daily reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A member of a committee seeing into the incident was quoted by
the paper as saying the vaccines have possibly been mislabeled in
Hungary where they were produced as anti-diphtheria and -tetanus
(D&AMP;T) vaccines while they are vaccines against D&AMP;T and a third
disease.
</P>
<P>
Vaccines against three diseases instead of only D&AMP;T are too
powerful for school children, producing side effects, the expert,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 boys and girls were hospitalized early this week
for suffering dizziness, nausea and headache after they were given
tetanus shots in an immunization campaign across Jordan for 25,744
primary and high school students.
</P>
<P>
Other causes of the students' symptoms have been excluded,
which include improper refrigeration, expiration of validity,
contamination of the vaccines, unsafe inoculation procedures and
use of dirty syringes, Jordanian Health Minister Na'el Ajlouni
said.
</P>
<P>
The causes will be clear next week, Ajlouni added.
</P>
<P>
The vaccines used on the students were donated by the United
Nations Children's Fund last year to Jordan's Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF Representative in Jordan Mislak Elias said early this
week that the vaccines met the international and national
standards at the time of their delivery to the Jordanian
ministry.

<HEADLINE> Pak Expects No Quick Fixes From Talks With India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Saturday expressed
welcome to the resumption of bilateral talks with neighboring
India but said it does not expect any quick fixes.
</P>
<P>
"This in our view is a significant development. However, as the
foreign secretary cautioned in New York last week this is only a
process that has been initiated," Foreign Office spokesman Tariq
Altaf said.
</P>
<P>
He told a weekly press briefing here that the bilateral
dialogue between Pakistan and India in the past has not yielded
positive results. "We expect no quick fixes this time either."
</P>
<P>
"This being so, our aim nevertheless is to sincerely attempt to
find a just settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"Whenever that becomes a reality the way will be paved for the
realization of unlimited possibilities of cooperation and normal
good neighborly relations between the two countries," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Pakistan and India will resume their official
bilateral talks here on matters of peace and security, Jammu and
Kashmir from October 15 to 18.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman expressed his appreciation for the efforts of the
international community in putting sufficient pressure on India to
come back to the table.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Pakistan and India are resuming negotiations
on the basis of the agreement reached by the two countries on June
23, 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The credit, I dare say, goes to our foreign policy for
remaining steadfast to our principled position that the Jammu and
Kashmir dispute being the core issue between Pakistan and India
should be addressed specifically and substantively," he said.

<HEADLINE> Mumbai Under Threat of Moth Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Mumbai, India's largest
commercial city on the western coast, is now under the threat from
a swarm of moths which has devastated mangrove forests along the
coast.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Express daily reported Saturday that the moth swarm
was moving up toward eastern and western sides of the city and
might swamp residential and industrial areas.
</P>
<P>
Wildlife scientists said the devastation was significant as
ecologically-sensitive mangroves play an important role in
maintaining bio-diversity along the coast of Mumbai, or Bombay as
it was formerly called.
</P>
<P>
Serving as a breeding and spawning ground for fish and other
marine life, mangrove forests also protect the shore from sea
erosion.
</P>
<P>
According to Sanjay Deshmukh, a leading scientist of the Bombay
Natural History Society, the moths, identified as Hyblaea Purea,
might be attracted to the lights of residential and industrial
areas along the coast.
</P>
<P>
The moths, whose origin is still a mystery, do not survive long
on land and they perish within three weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It has been observed since 1996 that the moths become active
during the Navratri festival (late September and early October),
when the mangroves are in full bloom and there is enough food for
the larvae to feed upon," said Deshmukh, an expert on mangroves.
</P>
<P>
Once they run out of food, the moths get attracted to lights
and swamp human habitations, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Express said residents of the eastern and western
suburbs of the city have complained that moths have been invading
their houses after dusk.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Petroleum Corporation to Be Restructured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 3 (Xinhua) -- A major structure reform of
the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) is to take place in six
month, KPC Chief Executive Officer Nader Sultan has announced.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the Arabic daily Arab Times
published Saturday, Sultan said the proposed KPC restructuring is
aimed at making the state-run oil conglomerate more efficient and
able to meet the challenges of the new millennium, as well as
helping stimulate domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
Sultan, who is also KPC's Vice Chairman, said that the KPC is
considering to convert Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) and Kuwait
National Petroleum Company (KNPC), two KPC affiliates, into
divisions and determine the full or partial privatization of
another two subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
Another major objective of the reform is to create more job
opportunities for Kuwaitis, Sultan said, adding that the
corporation is concentrating on putting more emphasis on projects
in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the KPC is considering the construction of
the country's fourth oil refinery to meet the growing energy
demand both at home and abroad. The present three refineries
in Kuwait have a total capacity of nearly 900,000 barrels
per day, 90 percent of which goes to exports.
</P>
<P>
He added that on the chemicals side, "we are also seeking
for joint ventures in Kuwait with foreign companies." Foreign
companies will be allowed to participate in the country's
upstream operations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the structural changes to be carried out, Sultan said,
the KPC is not planning to change its financial investment
policy.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Urges Peaceful Solution to Afghan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan earnestly hopes that
a peaceful solution to the long-running Afghan problem "will be
reached through diplomatic means, political contacts and
dialogue," a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman told a weekly press briefing that the United
Nations Secretary General's Special Envoy on Afghanistan, Lakhdar
Brahimi, will pay a visit to Iran and Pakistan starting October 3
for discussions on the Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, however, said that "we believe his mission will
remain incomplete if he does not visit Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan will extend every possible cooperation to Brahimi, he
said, adding that "our purpose is to be helpful to the U.N. and
the OIC (Organization of the Islamic Conference) so that his
mission is successful."
</P>
<P>
Brahimi is coming to visit Iran and Pakistan with a broad
agenda and his discussions with the officials in Tehran and
Islamabad were not expected to be confined to just a few subjects,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Wisdom and sagacity demand that all of us work together to
ensure continued peace and stability in the interest of the
region, because the future of the peoples is at stake," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand a deterioration in the situation will not
help anybody. It will only destabilize the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
At his last press briefing, the spokesman said the discussions
during Brahimi's visit would focus on the Afghan issue with
special reference to the role of Iran and Pakistan in bringing
about a durable peace in the war-ravaged Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the spokesman also urged the Afghan Taliban
militia to "expeditiously complete investigations in the killing
of Iranian personnel" in the northern Afghan town of
Mazar-i-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Investigations into reported massacres in the north of
Afghanistan last year also need to be expedited, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to media reports of the violation of the Afghan
territory by Iranian helicopters and jet fighters, the spokesman
said: "We urge both the brotherly countries to continue to
exercise restraint and display a high sense of responsibility."
</P>
<P>
"Any precipitate action would result in serious and perhaps
even unforeseen difficulties in the region," he said, adding: "It
is our earnest desire that such a situation is avoided."
</P>
<P>
He noted that Pakistan remained in constant touch with Iran and
the Taliban to promote better understanding and rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that our concerted efforts will help stabilize the
situation," said the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects Claims of Violating Afghan Airspace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran Saturday rejected claims by
the Afghan Taliban group that its air force has violated the
airspace of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for Iran's Zoulfaqar-2 military exercises in the
border areas Hassan Barati termed Taliban's claim as "mere lie,"
the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
A Taliban spokesman said on Friday that several Iranian jet
fighters intruded into the Afghan airspace that day and broke
sound barrier.
</P>
<P>
Barati said the Iranian air force is observing the
19.31-kilometer-wide fly zone along the border with Afghanistan,
which was previously determined.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's "futile allegations" are aimed at justifying its
"inhuman actions," the Iranian officer said.
</P>
<P>
Iran's relations with the Taliban strained after the Afghan
Islamic group acknowledged that its militia killed Iranian
diplomats in August in northern Afghanistan.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Spokesman on Non-Proliferation Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan expressed concern
Saturday that in spite of its positive and cooperative attitude
toward non-proliferation matters, "we get a sense of the goal post
being moved which creates avoidable complications."
</P>
<P>
"We would like to promote an atmosphere of positive
cooperation," Foreign Ministry spokesman Tariq Altaf told
reporters at a weekly press briefing.
</P>
<P>
He said Islamabad would like to get a sense of understanding
for its concerns both in the economic and security areas.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to see a continuation of the positive effort to
realize a just solution to the Jammu and Kashmir dispute." he
added.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question, the spokesman said the issues
relating to nuclear and conventional restraint and stabilization
would come up for discussion in the upcoming talks between the
foreign secretaries of Pakistan and India in Islamabad later this
month.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the U.S. call for a moratorium on fissile
material production by Pakistan and India during the talks for
concluding the Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty, he said,
"Moratorium is a complex matter."
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to agree to it straightaway," he added.
</P>
<P>
Elaborating on his point, the spokesman said the proposed
moratorium involves several important questions that need to be
addressed.
</P>
<P>
"These are not easy questions, you can't make straightaway
demands and expect straightaway reply," said the spokesman.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 3, (Xinhua) -- A U.N Secretary General
special envoy urged Taliban militia to exert efforts to ease
tension on the Afghanistan-Iran borders.
</P>
<P>
Lakhdar Ibrahimi, the U.N. envoy on Afghanistan, now visiting
the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was quoted by Al Itihad newspaper
Saturday as saying that the Taliban militia should meet the
demands of respecting human rights, stop excesses during fighting
and help easing tension on the borders with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahimi also called on Taliban to observe the internationally
acceptable principles to be integrated with the world community
and to remove the wrong concepts on women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
The international envoy affirmed the U.N. role was mainly
designed to help the Afghan people to live in peace and
stability, boost reconstruction efforts, maintain security and
end the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahimi said he would head for Iran Sunday to continue his
mission in the region. Welcoming the role of the Organization of
Islamic Conference (OIC), Ibrahimi welcomed the OIC joining his
efforts to settle the Afghan crisis. He added that an Islamic
delegation will attend his talks with the Iranian officials.
</P>
<P>
On his mission, Ibrahimi said it was designed to activate the
efforts for ending tensions along Iran-Afghanistan borders.
</P>
<P>
Hoping that the neighboring states will give a hand in settling
the crisis, the U.N. envoy affirmed the Afghan people have the
right to choose their government and way of life.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahimi arrived in Abu Dhabi last Wednesday for a visit during
which he had talks with UAE president Sheikh Zayed Ben Sultan Al
Nahyan on the situation in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, which recently asked Taliban diplomatic envoy
to leave Riyadh, the UAE and Pakistan are the only three states
recognizing Taliban militia government.

AMMAN, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The state prosecution has

including Iraqi Charge d' affaires to Jordan Hikmat Hajou, local
paper said Saturday.

<P>
State Prosecutor Mahmoud Obeidat has finished preparing the

four other Iraqis and two Egyptians.

<HEADLINE> SriLanka May Face Acute Water Shortage by 2003 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka could face an acute
water shortage by the year 2003, due to the incessant waste of
pipe borne water, the National Water Supply Board warned Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The board said the combined processing capacity from the Kelani
Ganga and Kalu Ganga rivers, at current consumption levels, would
not be adequate to meet the needs of an expanding population.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's population has more than doubled to over 18 million
in the past 50 years. Studies predict a net population increase of
over 11 million in 2003 compared with 1948 when the island country
gained independence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the net per capita domestic consumption of water is
likely to rise to 250,807 cubic meters in a few years, without
taking wastage into account.
</P>
<P>
The board said the figure represented a huge increase in
consumption especially if the dry season is taken into
consideration. Water must be re-cycled and domestic consumers
should be encouraged to construct domestic wells, it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has denied reports
that it would hold bilateral talks with Iraq on the issue of
prisoners of war, the Kuwait News Agency reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The reports that Kuwait and Iraq will hold meetings sponsored
by the Arab League on the POWs "are baseless because the issue has
been tackled within known frameworks," Kuwaiti Deputy Prime
Minister and Defense Minister Sheikh Salem Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah
said.
</P>
<P>
Salem stressed that any discussions on the POW issue must be
held within the framework of a tripartite commission sponsored by
the International Committee of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
Reports have said that there is a plan to hold discussions in
Saudi Arabia between Kuwait and Iraq on accusations of the Gulf
sheikdom that Iraq detains its nationals.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has accused Iraq of still jailing more than 600 of its
citizens abducted during Iraq's occupation of the Gulf state from
August 1990 to February 1991.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has acknowledged kidnaping Kuwaiti nationals during
the occupation period. But it claimed that the Kuwaiti prisoners
disappeared during a popular uprising in southern Iraq after the
1991 Gulf War driving Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Salem said that Kuwait views the POW issue as a humanitarian
one but Iraq tries to turn it into a political question.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Police Arrest Hundreds of Guest Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of foreign workers,
mainly Asians, have been arrested in a bid to return job chances
to unemployed Jordanians, local paper said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The aim of this campaign is to put an end to those who are
working illegally in the country" and it is also part of the
government's drive to combat the problem of unemployment of the
Jordanians, Minister of Interior Nayef Al Qadi late Friday told
the semi-official Jordan Times.
</P>
<P>
Through this campaign, the government can check the working
status of these workers and ensure that the relevant laws are not
violated, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the laws, any foreign worker must hold work
permits issued by the government annually, if he wants to be
employed in the kingdom. Foreigners working in the country
without such permits will be prosecuted. About 300,000 to 500,000
guest workers now live in Jordan, of whom only 40 percent hold
valid work permits, official figures said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Jordan Times quoted another government official
as saying on condition of anonymity that the current campaign
targeted the illegal workers from Asian countries, but "at a
later stage we will start pursuing illegal Arab workers."
</P>
<P>
"We did not want to start with them now to avoid unnecessary
problems with Arab states," he said, adding that the bulk of the
Arab workers in Jordan are from Egypt, Syria and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
With the arrest of the Asian workers, the government wants
to give a warning signal to the illegal Arab workers, who
are expected to approach police stations soon to correct their
status, the official added.
</P>
<P>
Both Qadi and the official refused to give the exact number of
the arrested foreign workers, but the Jordan Times quoted Filipino
Ambassador to Jordan Ruperto Dizon as saying that 170 foreign
workers were rounded up on Wednesday, 105 of them were Filipinos,
and 76 of the total were released on Thursday. The arrests on
other days are not declared yet.
</P>
<P>
The sweeping campaign in the past three days followed Jordanian
Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh's declaration on Wednesday that the
government will impose strict regulations on employment of guest
workers.
</P>
<P>
Under the regulations, the government will set up a system to
record the living and working places of the non-Jordanian workers
in the kingdom, activate a special public security unit to apply
the employment law, impose heavy penalties on those violating the
law, prosecute the foreign workers who enter Jordan illegally, ask
the unemployed guest workers to leave Jordan, and stop to give
visas to non-Jordanian laborers except within the framework of the
agreements reached between Jordan and other Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The non-Jordanian workers are widely believed to have grabbed
some job opportunities from the Jordanian ones. Jordanian
employers like to hire guest workers for they can pay them less
and do not have to undertake their insurance. Guest workers also
usually give better performances at their posts than the
Jordanians ones.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate in Jordan was officially estimated at 15
percent, but independent sources placed it at 27 percent.

<HEADLINE> Italian Parliament Takes Steps to Ease Tensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- In a step to ease tensions with
Turkey, an Italian parliament leader has invited his Turkish
counterpart to visit Rome for talks on bilateral ties, Turkey's
Daily News reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Italian President of the Chamber of Deputies Luciano Violante
sent the invitation Friday to Speaker of the Turkish Grand
National Assembly Hikmet Cetin. The invitation came as the ties
between the two countries strained after Turkey's outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) held a meeting recently in Italy.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to reaffirm that we want to preserve our friendly
relations and we hope that this incident will not affect the ties
between our (two) countries," Violante said in his invitation.
</P>
<P>
"Let me take this opportunity to extend an official invitation
to you to visit the (Italian) Chamber of Deputies. On that
occasion, I shall be pleased to discuss with you the ways and
means for closer cooperation between our assemblies, both at the
multilateral and bilateral levels," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Cetin was quoted by the newspaper as saying that "our
ambassador to Italy Inal Batu is coming (back to Turkey) on
Monday. We will listen to him. It is too early to give an answer
to the invitation to visit Rome."
</P>
<P>
The "Kurdish Parliament in Exile," a political wing of the PKK,
was allowed to hold a two-day meeting last Tuesday in the Italian
parliament building.
</P>
<P>
Angered by Italy's refusal to stop the Kurdish meeting, Turkey
has recalled its ambassador to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting since 1984 for an independent state
in the southeast of Turkey.

(Australian Eastern Standard Time)(08:00 GMT), with counting to
begin in the west a little later.
</P>
<P>
But the AEC has warned that the final result in many seats, and
perhaps for the whole election, may not be known tonight if the
outcome is as tight as polls and parties are predicting.
</P>
<P>
Australia's opposition Labor Party will need an overall swing
of four percent of the vote and will have to gain 27 more seats
than the 48 seats it held to win the election.
</P>
<P>
Analysts fear it could depend on preferences and counting of
postal votes with a larger than usual number of Australia's over
12 million voters choosing to vote before the election date
because of the long weekend and school holidays.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Countries Agree To Cut Tariffs on Farm Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 3 (Xinhua) -- After years of negotiation,
ASEAN member countries have agreed to cut tariffs on unprocessed
agricultural goods to 0-5 percent, starting in 2003 and finishing
in 2010, a Thai government official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A pact to this effect will be signed next week when the ASEAN
Free Trade Area (AFTA) Council convenes in Manila, the
Philippines, said the official who has followed the negotiations
on tariff cuts.
</P>
<P>
Member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) kicked off a campaign in 1995 to set up the AFTA, which
calls for tariffs to be reduced to 0-5 percent by 2003 for member
countries.
</P>
<P>
But some member countries want to delay tariff cuts on certain
unprocessed agricultural goods in two categories -- sensitive and
highly sensitive.
</P>
<P>
The countries used the sensitive lists to protect their
domestic industries from foreign competition. With the exception
of Singapore, ASEAN members have placed 379 items on the lists.
</P>
<P>
But after years of negotiation, ASEAN members have agreed to
cut tariffs on sensitive items to 0-5 percent by 2010, while those
on the highly sensitive list will carry tariffs higher than 5
percent, said the official who refused to be named.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN trade ministers are expected to continue negotiations in
two areas -- the final tariff rate for unprocessed agricultural
goods on the highly sensitive list, and the number of items on the
sensitive list.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has the most items on the sensitive list with 104,
including chicken wings, milk and cream and shrimps. Thailand has
the fewest items with just seven, including potatoes, coffee,
dried coconut and flowers.
</P>
<P>
Brunei has 14 items on the sensitive list, Indonesia 12, Laos
96, Myanmar 42, the Philippines 58 and Vietnam 23.
</P>
<P>
The highly sensitive list includes rice and sugar, posted by
Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia. The Philippines and
Indonesia have called for final tariffs on the highly sensitive
list to remain at 100 percent, while Malaysia has proposed a
figure of 20 percent.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Check Drug Abuse by Youngsters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Health Minister Halil
Ibrahim Ozsoy has stated that the government will take measures to
check drug abuse among youngsters in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The minister was quoted by local Daily News Saturday as saying
that the ministry's research showed about 3.5 percent of secondary
school students use drugs at least once.
</P>
<P>
Ozsoy said that the increasing number of these drug abusers
shows the importance of taking precaution measures as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Ozsoy said that in order to counter this trend, the ministry
has begun a program to educate primary school students about
drugs.
</P>
<P>
To prevent drug use and addiction, students need to be
fully educated, said the minister, adding that "If we educate
primary school students better we will be more successful in
our struggle".
</P>
<P>
Ozsoy gave a framework for a plan to educate students, saying
that in Turkey's largest three cities, especially in Istanbul,
the ministry will educate one teacher from every school about
anti-drug education, and in turn, those teachers will train their
fellow teachers.
</P>
<P>
"We will protect secondary school students and we will not let
youth be lost in the dark", he stated.

<HEADLINE> Australia Goes to Polls on Fine, Warm Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- About 12 million Australian
voters went to polling booths across the nation on a fine, warm
Saturday, with queues forming in some electorates at the start of
an election which polls predict will be a cliffhanger.
</P>
<P>
In a polling place near Canberra's suburb of Dickson, one of
the 9,000 polling booths around the nation, many voters cast their
ballots as early as 08:30 am.
</P>
<P>
Jenny Kapp, a project manager, said she voted the Opposition
Labor Party, although she thought Prime Minister John Howard's
Liberal Party and National Party coalition could win.
</P>
<P>
The coalition had 95 of the 148 lower house seats before the
election, 20 more than the minimum majority required to win the
election. If Labor won, it will be the first opposition to defeat
the government in an election after only one term since 1932,
which many voters and commentators said is less likely.
</P>
<P>
"Because they (the coalition) have got such a large margins and
it is very hard for Labor to win all those seats back," said Kapp.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party suffered a crushing defeat in the 1996
election, losing 31 seats mainly to the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Kapp said she cast a protest vote against the 10 percent goods
and services tax (GST) proposed by the coalition as central piece
of its tax reform plan to improve the nation's 60 year-old tax
system.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard has pinned his hope of re-election
on voters' acceptance of his business-friendly tax reform plan,
which was released two weeks before he called the election on
August 30.
</P>
<P>
"The GST is too bad," Kapp, who voted for the Labor Party
candidate for the lower house and the Democrats Party candidate
for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The Howard government might be surprised to find that some
small business owners who are supposed to be their supporters
voted against them.
</P>
<P>
A bespectacled small business owner in his 40s, who declined to
give his name, said he voted against the coalition as he would
have to pay 2,400 U.S. dollars more if the GST comes in.
</P>
<P>
If the GST comes in, phone calls, advertisements, which are
currently tax-free, will be taxed, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Howard government, however, has repeatedly said its tax
reform plan would reduce business costs by about 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Paul Sutherland, a real estate agent, said he voted for the
Labor Party, accusing the Howard government of treating the nation
"very poorly."
</P>
<P>
Sutherland said the government had not supported some of the
social causes, including the anti-racism efforts.
</P>
<P>
The Howard government's well-planned publicity of the tax
reform plan has won many votes.
</P>
<P>
Stuart MacPherson, an economic student at the Australian
National University, said both he and his girl friend voted for
the Liberal Party candidate.
</P>
<P>
MacPherson, who voted for the Democrats (Party candidate) in
the 1996 election, said the Liberal Party's tax reform plan was
good for Australia.
</P>
<P>
An old voter, who called himself James, said he voted for the
Liberal Party candidate.
</P>
<P>
"I think the country needs the tax reform plan (proposed by the
coalition)."
</P>
<P>
"I don't know whether I'll be better off or not if the GST
comes in. (But) in the long term certainly I think we'll be better
off," James said.
</P>
<P>
A nurse carrying two babies with her, who gave her name as
Hewett, said she voted for the Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
"I think we need to have a GST," she said, adding the tax plan
was visionary. "I think we should stick with John Howard's vision
keep going from there."
</P>
<P>
"(Opposition Leader) Kim Beazley already had a chance in many
positions when Labor was in Power (during 1983-1996)," she added.
</P>
<P>
Among the voters who were anti-GST, was a middle-aged public
servant, who gave her name as Maggie.
</P>
<P>
Maggie, who works for the Australian Taxation Bureau, voted for
the Labor Party candidate, saying the tax reform plan was not fair
and the tax reform policies should not have been developed in an
adverse situation, referring to the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
"They should have developed a tax policy in a much consultative
way," she said.
</P>
<P>
Among the voters supporting Labor was a teacher called Loris,
who said she voted for the Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
"I've always voted for Labor no matter what. I think they are
the lesser of the two evils."
</P>
<P>
"I think the problem with the GST is so damn confusing. I'm an
educated person. I have a lot of trouble understanding (it)...
Generally people are confused about it, and afraid to go with the
devil they don't know, better with the devil you know," she said.
</P>
<P>
Asked which party is going to win, she said it was hard to say.
</P>
<P>
"I've never felt so sort of unsure of myself. Generally you got
a good idea. This year I've got no idea whatsoever."
</P>
<P>
Many voter said they gave their support to he Democrats Party,
the third largest political force after the coalition and the
Labor Party. The Democrats held 7 Senate seats and secured no seat
in the lower house before the election, holding the balance of
power in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
During the election campaign, the Democrats Party called on
voters to vote for them to "keep the bastards honest," meaning
keeping the two major parties honest in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
An old lady, apparently dissatisfied with the two major
parties, said she voted for the Democrats Party's Senate candidate
to help "keep the bastards honest."
</P>
<P>
But she voted the Labor Party's low house candidate Bob
McMullan, saying: "I voted for the man, not the party."
</P>
<P>
Small parties like the Democrats Party and the Greens get some
support from cynical Australians.
</P>
<P>
Three jobless young voters said they voted for the small
parties, saying that the big parties were "bullshit."
</P>
<P>
Vote counting will begin as soon as polls close at 6 p.m. on
Saturday, and the outcome may not be known for some time.
</P>
<P>
In many marginal electorates, the final outcome is expected to
come down to preferences and postal votes, and the final result of
postal votes will not be known for another two weeks.

<HEADLINE> Mother Faints as "Dead" Daughter Returns Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 3 (Xinhua) -- When Dassy Tselapedi
walked into her mother's home last weekend, her family almost
died of shock, because they thought they had buried her months
earlier, Saturday Star reported.
</P>
<P>
The shy 34-year-old Dassy shivered herself when she was taken
into the cemetery and shown where her "body" lay at rest in a
simple grave.
</P>
<P>
Dassy's mother, Annah, said this week that she had collapsed
when she first saw her daughter.
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe my eyes. I thought I was dreaming and I
could not bear to look at her again. The next thing I found
myself lying flat on the ground and I can't remember how that
happened," she said.
</P>
<P>
Dassy said she was shocked to hear that her family had buried
someone they thought was her.
</P>
<P>
"That has caused me a great deal of pain. People, except my
family, can't accept me back into the community. When I came
back here on Saturday afternoon, people ran away from me.
</P>
<P>
"On Sunday I went to the local cafe and everyone who knew me
started running away. It was really embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
"People said I was a ghost. I tried to stop them to explain,
but only a few would listen to me. Some wanted to touch me to
feel if I was a real human being," said Dassy.
</P>
<P>
She regrets the pain her disappearance caused her family,
saying she left with her boyfriend for Heidelberg -- a town near
Johannesburg -- on the night of May 17 after a family quarrel
with her sister.
</P>
<P>
She decided not to tell anyone where they were.
</P>
<P>
Now, back at home, she can go out only at night, for fear of
being labeled a ghost or a zombie.
</P>
<P>
However, she is optimistic that her predicament won't last
long and that, in time, people will once again accept her as a
fellow human being.
</P>
<P>
Dassy's "resurrection" was a happy ending to a sad tale which
began in May when Dassy's mother reported her daughter missing at
the local police station.
</P>
<P>
Annah was told by police that her daughter's description
possibly matched that of a body found in a shallow grave near
Roodepoort.
</P>
<P>
Annah subsequently identified her daughter's "body" at the
local mortuary by a scar on the chest, because the face had been
mutilated by a bullet.
</P>
<P>
The body was buried by the Tselapedi family as that of their
beloved daughter Dassy.
</P>
<P>
But the happy ending to the family's agony does not explain
whose body lies buried in Dassy's grave.
</P>
<P>
The twist in the tale came when police revealed that the
location of the shallow grave containing the murdered corpse of a
woman had been pointed out to them by a local lawyer, who said a
client of his had told him about it.
</P>
<P>
Police tried in vain to get the attorney-general and court
officials to persuade the lawyer to reveal the client's name,
because he was suspected of murdering the woman found in the
grave.
</P>
<P>
Now police say that fingerprints show the woman buried in
Dassy's place could be Elizabeth April of Upington, Northern
Cape, but inquiries have so far drawn a blank. The body cannot
be exhumed until April's family can be located.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer still refuses to release the name of the client and
police are still trying to locate April's family in Upington.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Annah believes that the state should compensate her
for the costs incurred in burying the wrong body.

<HEADLINE> 57 Nigerians Perish in Boat Mishap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-seven people were killed in
a boat mishap on River Kaduna in Munya local government area of
Niger State with 20 others surviving, The Post Express reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hajiya Fati Kure, Chairperson of the Caretaker Committee of
Munya local government area, about 400 kilometers north of Lagos,
was quoted as confirming the incident, saying that 56 bodies out
of the 57 dead persons had been recovered.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred at about 4 p.m. on Tuesday when the
victims mostly nursing mothers and pregnant women were coming
back from Sarikin Pawa market aboard the local engine boat, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The boat which has a 100-passenger capacity had 77 persons
aboard at the time of the incident, an eye-witness said, adding
that 20 of them were rescued by fishermen along the bank of the
river.
</P>
<P>
The eye-witness noted that an attempt to rescue the remaining
victims came a little too late as they got drowned too soon after
the boat capsized.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that the cause of the mishap could be connected
with the decrepit condition of the local engine boat, which made
it vulnerable to strong waves and tides.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Petroleum Corporation to Be Restructed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 3 (Xinhua) -- A major structure reform of
the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) is to take place in six
month, KPC Chief Executive Officer Nader Sultan has announced.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the Arabic daily Arab Times
published Saturday, Sultan said the proposed KPC restructuring is
aimed at making the state-run oil conglomerate more efficient and
able to meet the challenges of the new millennium, as well as
helping stimulate domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
Sultan, who is also KPC's Vice Chairman, said that the KPC is
considering to convert Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) and Kuwait
National Petroleum Company (KNPC), two KPC affiliates, into
divisions and determine the full or partial privatization of
another two subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
Another major objective of the reform is to create more job
opportunities for Kuwaitis, Sultan said, adding that the
corporation is concentrating on putting more emphasis on projects
in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the KPC is considering the construction of
the country's fourth oil refinery to meet the growing energy
demand both at home and abroad. The present three refineries
in Kuwait have a total capacity of nearly 900,000 barrels
per day, 90 percent of which goes to exports.
</P>
<P>
He added that on the chemicals side, "we are also seeking
for joint ventures in Kuwait with foreign companies." Foreign
companies will be allowed to participate in the country's
upstream operations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the structural changes to be carried out, Sultan said,
the KPC is not planning to change its financial investment
policy.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Consumption in Ethiopia up by 19% </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Fuel consumption in
Ethiopia has increased by 19 percent since the Ethio-Eritrean
border conflict erupted in May, this year.
</P>
<P>
Haile Asegide, Minister of Urban Works and Development and
National Fuel Committee Chairman, is quoted by a media report
here Saturday as saying that before the border conflict, Ethiopia
used to import 86 million liters of fuel every month -- a figure
raised to 103 million liters at present.
</P>
<P>
Haile also predicts that there will be a 12 percent annual
increase in demand for fuel in the country.
</P>
<P>
Land-locked Ethiopia imports fuel through port of Djibouti
after the border conflict took place last May.
</P>
<P>
The minister notes that there are only 938 fuel transporting
trucks in Ethiopia and efforts are being made to assist private
entrepreneurs to import high capacity vehicles.
</P>
<P>
He also discloses that access to the market will be given to
additional foreign petroleum companies, adding that there have
only been four oil companies operating in Ethiopia until now.

<HEADLINE> Efforts Made in Tibet to Save Cultural Relics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Greater efforts have been made
during the past five months to protect historical ruins and
cultural relics in Ngari Prefecture in the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Some 140 archeologists recently restored 334 square meters of
ancient buildings, cleared three tombs and repaired 58 cultural
relics.
</P>
<P>
While clearing the ruins of a temple they discovered some early
wall paintings and Buddhist scriptures which will be a valuable
addition for the study of Tibetan history.
</P>
<P>
Emphasis has also been placed on protecting ancient
buildings. Archeologists restored some nearly collapsed walls and
cave dwellings, repaired broken structural components and
installed pipes to reduce erosion from rain water.
</P>
<P>
Both still and video cameras were used in this excavation and
renovation process, and more than 5,000 drawings of frescos, ruins
and unearthed relics were made, which are now in a local archive
center.
</P>
<P>
According to the Tibet regional cultural relics bureau, Tibet
will spend three to five years rescuing cultural relics in Ngari
Prefecture. This has also been put on the priority list of the
State Cultural Relics Bureau.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 3 (Xinhua)-- World champion 500cc motorcycle
champion Mick Doohan raced to the top spot for Australian Grand
Prix race in Phillip Island, Australia on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Doohan's time of 1 minute, 33.16 seconds secured him the pole
position, half a second ahead of his major rival Biaggi.
</P>
<P>
It was fractionally slower than Doohan's pole-setting time
last year, when he fell while leading the race, but almost a full
second under his own lap record for the track.
</P>
<P>
American John Kocinski will start from third place on the grid
with New Zealander Simon Crafar fourth.
</P>
<P>
Biaggi suffered a setback while he slid off on turn nine,
following the tumbling Honda into a tire barrier.
</P>
<P>
But the Italian was unhurt in the fall and maintained his
front row position based on Friday's quick time which he managed
in the final lap of the session.
</P>
<P>
Defending Australian champion Alex Criville of Spain will
start from the second row of the grid in seventh spot.

JOHANNESBURG, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading South African Newspapers Saturday:
</P>
<P>
The Citizen:
</P>
<P>
-- South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki had deceived the
world, the South African public and the Basotho nation with a
premature announcement that rival parties in Lesotho had reached
an agreement that would normalize the kingdom, Lesotho opposition
parties said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
-- The Johannesburg Stock Exchange gold stocks roared to a
fresh year peak Friday, invigorated by a strong bullion price as
investors poured money into a sector seen as a safe haven in
slumping equity markets.
</P>
<P>
Saturday Star:
</P>
<P>
-- Rival Lesotho political parties agreed that fresh elections
would be held within 15 to 18 months, but were yet to agree on
whether or not Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili's government
should remain in power until then, South Africa's Safety and
Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi said Friday night.

<P>
LIMA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian Foreign Minister Eduardo
Ferrero resigned Friday in the middle of the Peru-Ecuador
talks on border disputes.
</P>
<P>
Ferrero, who took over the foreign ministry last year
and has been in charge of border negotiations, refused to explain
the reason of his resignation, saying only that his decision was
irrevocable.
</P>
<P>
The Peru-Ecuador talks on border disputes were nearing a
negotiated settlement of a disputed border area, for which the two
countries had fought two wars.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers said that President Alberto Fujimori decided
recently to take charge of the talks himself, which might have
made Ferrero feel marginalized.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Alberto Pandolfi, to whom Ferrero submitted his
resignation, told a news conference Friday that the ministerial
talks on border disputes were over and the presidents of the two
countries already began talks on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Pandolfi referred to a constitutional clause that the authority
of formulating foreign policies belongs to the president.
</P>
<P>
President Fujimori is expected to meet Ecuadorian President
Jamil Mahuad in the United States on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori had said that 80 percent of the problems involved in
the talks had been settled and an agreement was expected within
the year.

SHENZHEN, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Taxes paid by overseas-funded
enterprises in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone amounted to 889
million yuan (107 million U.S. dollars) between January and
August, a year-on-year rise of 44.29 percent.
</P>
<P>
The tax revenues from overseas-funded enterprises accounted for
11.36 percent of the total local tax revenues in the period.
</P>
<P>
Flexible operations have allowed overseas-backed enterprises in
Shenzhen to avoid the ill effects of the Asian financial crisis
and to maintain growth in sales and profit, market analysts say.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months, exports of these enterprises were
valued at 9.539 billion U.S. dollars, a year-on-year rise of 10.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
The increase in tax revenues is partly because a number of
overseas-funded enterprises began paying taxes this year after
enjoying tax exemptions or reductions for a certain number of
years. And, more effective measures against tax evasion have
helped.
</P>
<P>
With its improved investment environment, Shenzhen attracted
1.105 billion U.S. dollars worth of foreign investment in the
first eight months, a year-on-year rise of 11.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Exports Less Wood, Earns More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's wood products export
dropped by 3.3 percent in the first eight months of 1998 but its
income from wood export rose by 3.8 percent compared to that of
the same period of last year, a report from Accra said.
</P>
<P>
Ghana's Forest Products Inspection Bureau said in its August
report that the country earned 110.2 million U.S. Dollars from
wood products export from January to August, compared with 106.2
million dollars in the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The six major destinations of Ghana's wood products are the
United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Others are the Netherlands, Belgium, Australia, Spain, Hong
Kong, Cyprus, Saudi Arabia, Japan and Greece.
</P>
<P>
The products include air dried lumber, kiln dried lumber,
overland lumber, veneers and plywood.
</P>
<P>
The report said the increase in value and the decrease in
volume is consistent with the government's policy to export low
volume of wood products at higher value.

<HEADLINE> Taiwanese Donates Bone Marrow to Leukemic Boy in Mainland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, October 3 (Xinhua) -- A boy stricken with leukemia in
Haikou, capital of south China's Hainan Province, recently
underwent a bone marrow transplant thanks to the donation of a
Taiwan teacher.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Guangfu, a sixth-grade pupil at the Haikou Huaxing School,
has been suffering from leukemia for two years.
</P>
<P>
As no suitable marrow donor was found among his relatives, he
awaited surgery at Hainan People's Hospital until a teacher in his
forties with suitable marrow was found among the 300,000
volunteers at a marrow-donation bank in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The surgeon who performed the transplant said the operation was
successful and the boy's condition is now quite stable.
</P>
<P>
There have been only four cases of non-blood-relationship
marrow transplants in the mainland and two of them were
successful.

<P>
ZAGREB, October 2 (Xinhua)-- The Provisional Election
Commission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation
(OSCE) mission to Bosnia-Herzegovina on Friday confirmed the
final results of the September 12 and 13 general elections.
</P>
<P>
According to the results, the Moslem member Alija Izetbegovic
won 511,541 votes, the new Croat member Ante Jelavic won 189,438
votes while the new Serb member Zivko Radisic won 359,937 votes.
</P>
<P>
Nikola Poplasen beat Biljana Plavsic in the race for the
Republika Srpska presidency by 322,684 against 286,606.
</P>
<P>
OSCE mission head Robert Barry said Friday that the elections
were successful in all aspects because they strengthened forces
supporting the Dayton peace agreement, and showed that those
wishing to block the peace process were gradually losing the
voters' confidence.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnia-Herzegovina constitution clearly states that the
state parliament should be constituted within a 30-day period from
the technical confirmation of election results, while entity
parliaments should be formed in 20 days and canton assemblies 10
days.
</P>
<P>
There are still no precise deadlines for the constitution of
the state presidency and the transfer of authority will be
performed in line with a decision by High Representative Carlos
Westendorp.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Introduce Early Warning System on Natural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will
introduce "early warning system" to forewarn farmers of natural
hazards to enable them to save their crops and investment from the
fury of nature, according to a high government official.
</P>
<P>
A proposal in this regard has been incorporated in the national
crop policy which is awaiting approval of the government, The
Financial Express Saturday quoted the official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Through the system, the farmers will be informed of impending
drought, heavy rain, precipitation, fog and moisture, etc. in
advance.
</P>
<P>
Along with the forewarning of the atmospheric condition, the
farmers will also be advised on what they are to do in the
situation.
</P>
<P>
The machinery of the agriculture extension department,
agriculture information service and the local governments will be
extensively used to reach the forecast on the behavior of nature
along with advice to farmers.
</P>
<P>
The early warning system for the farmers might be introduced by
the middle of next year, the official indicated.
</P>
<P>
Now, weather forecast and advice on agricultural practice are
aired through Bangladesh Betar (radio).
</P>
<P>
Though the radio plays an important role, the marginal and
small farmers can not afford to have individual radio sets because
of their economic condition, and because of its limitation, it
cannot broadcast forecast and advice continuously, he said.
</P>
<P>
A supplementary work on broadcast is needed to make the
information reach the farmers, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
This supplementary work can be effectively done by the field
workers of the agriculture extension department, he added.
</P>
<P>
Natural calamities like drought, flood, cyclone, etc. strike
Bangladesh every year and it has been observed that loss to the
crop or agriculture investment is more than human life in any such
calamity.

<HEADLINE> Canada, U.S. Settle Truck Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Canada and the United States
reached an agreement on Friday settling a truck dispute in which
several northern U.S. states blocked Canadian truckers carrying
cattle, hogs and grain south of the border.
</P>
<P>
For the past two weeks, South Dakota has been blocking Canadian
trucks carrying livestock and grain. Other U.S. states, including
North Dakota, Idaho, Minnesota, Montana and Wyoming, increased
inspections of Canadian trucks.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Canada asked for consultations under the World Trade
Organization (WTO) and the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) over the U.S. actions. The consultations are an interim
step to a full complaint under either trade pact.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Friday night, the Canadian government
welcomed the agreement by the governors of the U.S. states to end
the blocking of Canadian truckers.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased that the U.S. federal government has intervened
to stop the harassment," said Canada's International Trade
Minister Sergio Marchi.
</P>
<P>
As a result of this, the Canadian government has suspended its
request for consultations under NAFTA and WTO dispute settlement
process, Marchi said.
</P>
<P>
"However, Canada has advised the U.S. that it will reactivate
the consultations immediately if any U.S. state again restricts or
obstructs access of Canadian agro-food products," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Friday's agreement "opens the way for the two federal
governments to resume the discussions we have been having to
address issues the industry has identified as trade irritants or
potential irritants," said Canada's Agriculture and Agro-Food
Minister Lyle Vanclief.

<HEADLINE> Australians Go to Polls in Tight Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Australian voters went to
polling booths Saturday across the nation, with queues forming in
some electorates at the start of an election which polls predict
will be a cliffhanger.
</P>
<P>
Many voters were out very early.
</P>
<P>
In Queensland state, one of the three key states, some voters
in the Ipswich area queued up as early as 6 a.m. to cast their
votes when polls opened at 8 a.m. (Australian Eastern Standard
Time).
</P>
<P>
Ipswich City Councilor Paul Tully said such an early turnout
has traditionally meant a strong swing against the government.
</P>
<P>
But Prime Minister John Howard was still hopeful of a win as he
cast his vote in his Sydney electorate of Bennelong in New South
Wales state, despite a last minute polling which has his Liberal
Party and National Party coalition and the opposition Labor Party
neck and neck.
</P>
<P>
"I am hopeful, but it will be tight," said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Labor Party needs 27 more seats than it held
before the election campaign a month ago to have the 75 seat
minimum majority required, to form a new government.
</P>
<P>
The ruling coalition had 95 of the 148 lower house seats before
the election, 20 more than the minimum majority required to win
the election.
</P>
<P>
If Labor wins, it will be the first opposition to defeat the
government in an election after only one term since 1932, which
many voters and commentators said it is less likely.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Australian Electoral Commission in Canberra
said polling booths were reporting a busy start to the day but
there had been no problems experienced so far.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of voters in the state of Victoria, the nation's
manufacturing and business center, also headed out early to cast
their votes, according to the Victorian office of the Australian
Electoral Commission.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Steven Kennedy said voters had arrived in their
droves at 8 a.m. as part of the traditional early-morning rush to
the polling booths.
</P>
<P>
While vote counting will begin as soon as polls close at 6
p.m., the outcome may not be known for some time.
</P>
<P>
In many marginal electorates the final outcome is expected to
come down to preferences and postal votes, and the final result of
postal votes will not be known for another two weeks.
</P>
<P>
About 9,000 polling places are open across the nation Saturday.
</P>
<P>
To enable everyone to vote, the Australian Electoral Commission
has arranged over 500 mobile polling teams, visiting 2,100
hospitals and nursing homes and 120 remote locations.
</P>
<P>
The voters are required to select 148 members of the House of
Representatives from 1,106 candidates, and 40 members of the
Federal Senate from 329 candidates.
</P>
<P>
Under the nation's constitution, to win the election, a party
or a coalition must win at least 75 of the 148 seats of the lower
house, or an absolute majority.
</P>
<P>
Under the nation's preferential voting system, voters are
required to rank candidates in order of preference on the ballot
papers. To be elected, a candidate must achieve an absolute
majority, that is, at least 50 percent plus one vote, either on
first preference or following distribution of preference votes.
</P>
<P>
If no candidate has more than half of the votes, the candidate
with the fewest votes is excluded. The excluded candidate's votes
are transferred to the other candidates according to the second
preferences shown by voters on the ballot papers.
</P>
<P>
This process of excluding candidates one by one, continues
until one candidate has more than half the total votes and is
declared elected.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Strengthen Vocational, Technical Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
planned to strengthen the vocational and technical centers in the
country under a 120 million taka (2.55 million U.S. dollars)
project to fight the worsening problem of unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, now under review of the Planning Commission,
a number of new trade courses are to be introduced in such
institutions to meet the growing needs of skilled manpower in
industries, The Financial Express Saturday quoted official sources
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The matter of manpower export is also considered while
designing the project, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Proposal for the project, initiated by the Labor and Manpower
Ministry, is expected to be placed at a meeting of the Executive
Committee of the National Economic Council shortly for approval.
</P>
<P>
New courses will be designed taking into consideration the
technological changes taking place in the world and the need for
manpower in domestic enterprises as well as major manpower
importing countries, they said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the students of the country's 11 technical training
centers are being trained in 18 trade courses, quite inadequate to
meet even the local needs for skilled manpower, they observed.
</P>
<P>
No updated figure of unemployment in Bangladesh is available,
but an earlier estimate put the number of adults without jobs at
21 million, in addition to millions more under-employed people.

<HEADLINE> China Strives to Ease Job-Hunting Woes (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The growing number of laid-offs from State-owned enterprises
(SOEs) is caused by the relatively swift action taken against a
protracted problem -- gross inefficiency in SOEs -- that has
dragged on unsolved for years. Now, as reform deepens and the
construction of a market economy gains momentum, certain "growing
pains" have to be endured.
</P>
<P>
The advent of mass underemployment and unemployment in China
worsens in the absence of a complete social security system. But
the government knows that it must guarantee basic living standards
for unemployed and laid-offs from SOEs, and help those without
work find new jobs if stability is to be maintained.
</P>
<P>
"It is not only an economic issue, but also a political one
which is closely related to economic development, social stability
and the long-term prosperity and security of the Chinese nation,"
said Chinese President Jiang Zemin during his keynote speech at a
national conference on ways to provide basic living standards for
the unemployment last May.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will tighten its macro control to ensure
that state enterprises lay off their employees in a planned and
gradual way to avoid placing too much employment or re-employment
pressure on society and maintain social stability.
</P>
<P>
The government will also work to maintain eight-percent
economic growth this year to create a favorable environment
for employment. It will further give banking, taxation, financial
and administrative assistance to laid-off workers who seek
employment with self initiative.
</P>
<P>
SOEs are also urged to do more for their former employees,
instead of leaving them alone in the care of government and
society. They are required to set up re-employment centers, grant
allowances for basic living expenses, pay pensions and other
social security fees and provide professional training to help
those laid off get new jobs.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, a total of 300,000 laid-offs had registered at
seven re-employment centers set up by the city's textile,
metallurgical and other industrial sectors since July 1996. Some
218,000 of them had found new jobs by the end of 1997. Similar
schemes have been introduced to 111 cities across the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, laid-offs are urged to break away from their
outdated employment ideology -- believing that one is only
employed in a real sense if engaged in a permanent job in an SOE
or collective -- and rely more on themselves than the state. They
are encouraged to engage in service sector work, which has been
dominated by migrants from rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that to promote re-employment work and relieve
the burden on both the state and enterprises, China must speed up
its construction of a complete social security system including
pensions, medical care and housing insurance.
</P>
<P>
Only with joint efforts from government, enterprises, social
sectors and redundant workers themselves can re-employment work
succeed and a dozen millions of laid-offs like Wang Zhaolan pursue
a better life. And her case shows that the real power to solve
one's problems lies with oneself.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Trade, Economic Ties With China Developing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The trade and economic ties
between  Vietnam and China have been developing smoothly over the
past few years, according to the latest issue of the weekly
Vietnam Investment Review.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade volume between Vietnam and China rose sharply
over the past few years, increasing from 37 million U.S. dollars
in 1991 to 1.44 billion dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months of this year, two-way trade value
reached 613 million dollars, of which Vietnam's exports to China
posted 271 million dollars, said the weekly.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade turnover now accounts for seven percent of
Vietnam's total export-import value.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's exports to China cover a wide range and include
rubber, coffee, crude oil, coal, rice and seafood plus fruits and
vegetables. Imports from China are fertilizers, steel, building
materials, vegetable  oil, textile products, fruits and
children's toys.
</P>
<P>
The weekly also said Chinese-invested projects in Vietnam are
proving effective despite the investments in most small and
medium-sized projects proceeding slowly.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics showed that China had 56 projects licensed
to operate in Vietnam with a total capital investment of 114
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
These projects extend over broad areas of industry,
agro-forestry, seafood, construction and services and encompass 20
cities and provinces.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 41 projects are operating effectively with a
total investment of 102 million dollars. The projects have posted
a turnover of 27.6 million dollars and employed 1,550 workers.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese weekly said experts believe that with the return
of Hong Kong to China, Chinese direct investments in Vietnam will
diversify and become quite effective.

<HEADLINE> Canadian PM Expresses Sadness at News of Helicopter Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien expressed sadness on behalf of the Canadian people at the
news of the crash of a military helicopter that killed six people
in Quebec's Gaspe region on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The search-and-rescue Labrador helicopter was returning from a
medical evacuation in Quebec when it crashed about 400 kilometers
northeast of Quebec city.
</P>
<P>
All six people on board were killed in the crash, which ignited
a forest fire, reports said.
</P>
<P>
There has been no immediate word about what caused the accident.
</P>
<P>
"This accident is a tragic and terrible reminder to us all of
the risks that our courageous search and rescue teams expose
themselves to on a daily basis," Chretien said in a statement,
offering his deepest sympathy to the grieving families and friends.
</P>
<P>
Investigators from Canada's Transportation Safety Board are
reported to be heading to the scene.
</P>
<P>
The Labrador helicopters, which Canada acquired in the 1960s,
use outdated technology and have a lengthy record of engine and
engine system failures.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the Canadian government announced that the
Labrador fleet would be replaced by new Cormorant helicopters
beginning in 2001.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Civilian Plane Shot Down by Tamil Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 3 (Xinhua) -- A Sri Lankan civilian flight
that went missing three days ago was shot down by rebels of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), reports reaching here
from the north of the country Saturday said.
</P>
<P>
The debris of the plane and the bodies of several passengers
have been washed ashore in the sea off the Mannar coast in Sri
Lanka's northwest.
</P>
<P>
It is clear that the LTTE shot down the plane because the Tamil
civilians and the airline authorities did not heed to the orders
of the LTTE which has been waging a 15-year war for a separate
state in the country.
</P>
<P>
Three highly decomposed bodies of a woman and two males were
found floating in the sea off the Mannar coast Thursday evening in
search operations for the Lionair flight which went missing last
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Additionally a national identity card and a life jacket with
Russian lettering has confirmed suspicions that the flight had
crashed into the sea.
</P>
<P>
The civilian flight carrying 48 passengers, a four-member
Russian cockpit crew and a two-member Sri Lankan cabin crew
disappeared off the radar screen about 20 minutes after take-off
at 1.45 p.m. from the Palaly airport in the Jaffna Peninsula last
Tuesday.

<P>
HANOI, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's rice exports in the
whole year of 1998 would reach 3.6 million tons, an official
report said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government has released an official letter
covering new management regulations on the export of rice in the
last three months of 1998 and early 1999.
</P>
<P>
The government said that the management of rice exports in the
remaining months of 1998 and the first months of 1999 must ensure
the purchase of all commodity rice from farmers as well as
national food security.
</P>
<P>
The quota for the export of rice in the fourth quarter of the
year is set at 500,000 tons so that the country's rice exports in
the whole 1998 will reach 3.6 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Lawyers Criticize House Judiciary Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton's
lawyers on Friday said the Judiciary Committee of the House of
Representatives was rushing toward a "dangerous, standardless
inquiry" on impeachment before defining what constitutes an
impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
Republicans want to "damage the president, distract government
from its proper business and waste enormous time and resources
with absolutely no offsetting benefit to the people," the
president's lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
The attorneys argued their case in a 30-page memo on standards
for impeachment. The memo was prepared for the Republican and
Democratic leaders of the Judiciary Committee by David Kendall,
Clinton's private lawyer, and White House Counsel Charles F.C.
Ruff.
</P>
<P>
The committee will vote next week on whether to recommend to
the House to open the first impeachment inquiry since the
Watergate hearings against Richard M. Nixon 24 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The lawyers said the committee would vote against impeachment
proceedings if it followed the intent of the framers of the
Constitution, clear historical precedents and the standards
applied during the Nixon proceedings.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing in the Starr referral is remotely sufficient to
warrant an impeachment inquiry," they said. "The Judiciary
Committee is poised to vote on a resolution calling for the formal
commencement of impeachment proceedings without having offered any
benchmark -- or indeed any approximation -- for impeachable
offenses."
</P>
<P>
"That failure portends a dangerous, standardless inquiry, a
kind of roving commission by the majority to inflict partisan
injury on the minority," the lawyers said. "Even assuming that
every allegation in the one-sided referral were true, there is
simply nothing there that approaches any great offense against the
Constitution."
</P>
<P>
The lawyers said the committee's process was "politically
irresponsible."

PARIS, October 2 (Xinhua)-- Top four seeds all advanced into
the semi-finals as top-seeded Briton Greg Rusedski and
second-seeded Dutchman Jan Siemerink scored victories in straight
sets in the quarter-finals of the 400,000 U.S. dollars ATP Tour
event at Toulouse, France on Friday.
</P>

Earlier third-seed Thomas Johansson of Sweden held off
Frenchman Stephane Huet 3-6, 6-4, 7-5 and fourth-seed Nicolas

Big-serving Rusedski, 14th in the latest ATP Tour rankings,
brushed aside the challenge from 20-year-old Frenchman Arnaud
Clement 6-4, 6-1, taking just 56 minutes to advance.
</P>
<P>
Siemerink, 20th in the rankings, struggled in the first set
against 17-year-old Swiss player Roger Federer before prevailing
7-6 (7-5), 6-2.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide PC Server Market Sluggish in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide PC server
shipments in the second quarter this year dropped to just over
487,800 units, representing a negative 1-percent sequential
growth, a U.S. market analysis firm reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Leveled out at 17 percent, this was the lowest year-over-year
growth on record in the last three years, said International Data
Corporation (IDC) in a report.
</P>
<P>
According to IDC analysis, turmoil in Japan played a major role
in the worldwide PC server shipment decline. The overall downturn
is also due to a number of other factors, including increased
inventory in the United States, modest growth in Europe and a
slowdown in high-end PC server sales, the IDC said.
</P>
<P>
A computer in a network shared by multiple users, server may
refer to both the hardware and the software, or the software that
performs the service. The PC servers in the IDC analysis refer to
hardware only.
</P>
<P>
The IDC said the worldwide server market in the second quarter
was divided mainly by U.S. PC makers Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, IBM
and Dell, whose combined share came to 66.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
While Japan rides out its economic crisis, the IDC predicted
that vendors selling in Asia would continue to perform poorly
until mid next year.
</P>
<P>
However, the IDC remained optimistic about PC server demand in
markets such as the U.S., Western Europe and Latin America.

<HEADLINE> China Strives to Ease Job-Hunting Woes (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Life has just begun, this time
at 40, for Wang Zhaolan; she has lost two jobs in six years and
then so decided to put herself in control and open a business of
her own -- a teahouse in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"It's early days yet, but my ambition is build up Fortune
House into a chain of tea houses throughout the city," says the
woman who was first made redundant more than six years ago.
</P>
<P>
Wang got one of the earliest tastes of "xia gang", or getting
laid off work, in 1992, when the term was hardly heard at all in
everyday Chinese conversation. Now "xia gang " is shaking society,
and even national television commercials are aired to show people
that being out of work is no social stigma.
</P>
<P>
As for Wang, she lost her "iron rice bowl" job at the Beijing
Trademark Ribbon Factory because of the unit's poor
performance. Then she got a job as a toilet cleaner in a Beijing
hotel, where she learned English in her spare time. Next she
became a waitress in a private tea house, where she learned how to
make tea and operate a business. And now, with cash borrowed from
her relatives and friends she has her own tea house.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that a total of 11.5 million employees
had been laid off in China by September, 1997, eight percent of
the country's total employed population. Most used to work in the
textile, machinery and electronics sectors.
</P>
<P>
Of all those laid-off, 4.62 million have been re-employed but
another 4.32 million are job hunting. Of them, the vast majority
-- 4.11 million -- have fallen into poverty since becoming laid
off.
</P>
<P>
Some are doing work they would have turned their noses at just
a few years ago. One Beijing woman, a clerk in an inefficient
enterprise, nipped in and got herself a job as a nanny to a
toddler after the family's previous nanny was called back to her
countryside home. Many city residents may have to do the same --
do service and menial work that was previously thought the domain
of migrant workers.
</P>
<P>
Never has China been faced with unemployment and
underemployment as it is today. And it seems going to get worse
before it turns for the better. It is estimated that four million
workers will be laid off in each of the next three years, and 3.2
million of them need to be re-employed. With the existing 6.25
million fully unemployed people, China's unemployment and
underemployment will grow up to a total of 19.2 million by the end
of 2000.

<P>
BEIJING, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Ping, an elderly editor
with the China Higher Education Press, and her retired husband
live in downtown Beijing and depend on kindhearted neighbors to
heavy household chores.
</P>
<P>
The couple's dependence on others centers on the fact they both
suffer from heart problems and their only son is working in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"I hope we can move to a senior citizen's home once I retire so
we will have someone to care for us in times of need," said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that elderly people who have children
studying or working in other cities or foreign countries account
for over 20 percent the total number of Beijing families with
elderly members.
</P>
<P>
The number of so-called "empty nest" families in some colleges
and institutes, accounts for between 30-40 percent of the total,
with Beijing University alone having over 1,500 families in the
category.
</P>
<P>
The reform and open polices, combined with the blossoming
market economy, have prompted an increasing number of young people
to leave their parents in search of better opportunities in other
cities or foreign countries. This has in turn led to the
increasing number of "empty nests", according to Zhang Wenfan,
president of the Chinese Association on Aging.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that more that 100,000 elderly parents will be
left on their own in Guangzhou, capital of south China's
Guangdong Province, by the year 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
While elderly parents need the daily care and attention of
younger people, they nonetheless want to maintain independent
styles of life, said Zhang, adding that senior citizens homes
which offer improved healthcare and entertainment facilities
provide a viable option.
</P>
<P>
The homes enable the elderly to enjoy a private family life,
while at the same time enable them to enjoy the benefits of maid
service, laundry and shopping facilities, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The first apartment house specially designed for senior
citizens opened in east China's Anhui Province in 1986 and more
than such 600 senior citizens homes across China currently provide
elderly people with access to independent living.
</P>
<P>
"We can trade our current apartment for quarters in a senior
citizens home in suburban Beijing when I retire," said Zhang
Ping. "My son has already promised to provide financial support."
</P>
<P>
A recent survey of Beijingers between the ages of 50-59
revealed great demand for future occupancy in senior citizens
homes. Some 4.7 percent of respondents expressed an immediate
willingness to move to senior homes, with 14 percent indicating
their intention to do so later in life.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wenfan noted that a number of senior citizens homes have
been built in Beijing, and numerous other facilities are being
designed for individuals with varying financial capabilities.
</P>
<P>
"We are exploring ways to care for elderly Chinese, especially
those living on their own," said Zhang, adding that the senior
citizens homes must be built in accordance with the nation's
social and economic conditions.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
revised rattan and sawn timber exports in an attempt to conserve
natural resources, preserve global environmental quality and
facilitate control and boost the export of the commodities.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Ministry of Industry and Trade said that
the rattan and woodworking industry provided wide job
opportunities, especially for low-income people, and it was
therefore necessary to preserve regular supply of rattan and wood
to this industry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has issued decrees on rattan exports and sawn
timber exports, the spokesman was quoted by Antara News Agency
Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The volume of rattan which can be exported each year is set by
the Ministry of Forestry and Plantations in accordance with the
existing supplies so as not to affect the conservation of forest
resources and the environment.
</P>
<P>
Rattan exports are allowed only by payment of a sight L/C
through a government-owned foreign exchange bank opened by an
overseas importer and must not be lower than the export reference
price which prevailed at the time the L/C was opened.
</P>
<P>
The two decrees went into effect on September 25, 1998, the
spokesman added.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Friday
launched a major new initiative to provide emergency funding for
countries affected by global financial turmoil to help them
overcome their difficulties.
</P>
<P>
A day before finance ministers and central bankers from the
world's major economies were due to meet to discuss ways to save
the world economy, U.S. President Bill Clinton said his nation
would work with its partners to forge a "new mechanism" to provide
fresh money for cash-strapped nations around the world.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told reporters at the White House that the aim of such
a new facility, to be anchored in the International Monetary Fund,
would be "to provide contingent finance to help countries ward off
global financial contagion."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan would explore the possibility with
their counterparts from the major industrial Group of Seven (G-7)
nations.
</P>
<P>
He also said he was asking international financial leaders "to
lend quickly so as to help other countries reform their financial
sectors while also helping the most vulnerable citizens."
</P>
<P>
He called on multilateral lenders "to use loan guarantees and
other innovative means to leverage private-sector lending to
emerging markets, and to expand their own lending as much as
possible within their guidelines to countries affected by the
crisis who desperately need an infusion of new cash."
</P>
<P>
The president said Washington had held "constructive" early
discussions with its G-7 partners about the proposal and the G-7
financial leaders will discuss over the weekend about exactly how
that would work.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said on Friday that Saturday's G-7 meeting would stress
the need for global growth, Japan's economic revival, and the
crisis in emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
"I suspect the focus will be very largely on Japan and the
urgent importance of Japan implementing effective measures to lead
a sustained domestic demand-led growth which is critical not only
for the Japanese people, but for the people of Asia and indeed for
recovery in the rest of the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged Europe to focus on growth as its contribution to
diffusing the world financial problems.

<HEADLINE> Moon Cakes Become Popular Moon Festival Gift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Sending moon cakes to friends
and family members on the Moon Festival, a festival which falls on
October 5 this year, has gained increasing popularity in major
Chinese cities, according to a recent survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the Horizon Market Survey and Analysis
Company, was carried out in 11 cities, including Beijing, Shanghai
and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
A mere six percent of 5,673 respondents aged 18 and above
indicated they did not eat a single moon cake on last year's Moon
Festival. However, 5,310 respondents did eat moon cakes, with 49.1
percent of the total indicating they received the treats as gifts
from their companies, friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
Local residents in Shanghai, Xiamen, and Guangzhou mainly buy
moon cakes as gifts, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
In terms of quality, only 24 percent of those surveyed
expressed satisfaction with the taste, with 1,293 persons
expressing varying degrees of dissatisfaction.
</P>
<P>
Some 40.3 percent respondents said moon cakes are over priced
and 49.3 percent noted the cakes are most often overly sweet and
lack a pleasing taste. Various other respondents pointed to the
lack of nutritional values and poor packaging.
</P>
<P>
Chinese families traditionally gather on the Moon Festival to
eat moon cakes to ensure that all family members will remain
together.

<HEADLINE> Media Partners Suing UEFA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 2 (Xinhua)-- Media Partners, a Milan-based
media sales group who is promoting a breakaway European Super
League, said on Friday it had lodged a suit with the European
Commission against European soccer's governing body UEFA and its
members for their alleged infringement upon the EU competition
rules.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Media Partners believes the football
authorities have infringed EU competition rules by abusing their
dominant position and by preventing new bodies to organise and
market football competitions in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after UEFA unveiled in Geneva its
response to the threatened breakaway league -- plans for a 24- or
32-member European Champions' League with total prize money of
between 446-594 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The media sales group is promoting a 36-team pan-European
League and a new knockout competition called the ProCup
comprising 96 clubs.
</P>
<P>
The company's president, Rodolfo Hecht, said the company had
filed the complaint with the European Union's executive arm to
protect clubs from the threat of sanctions from established
football authorities.
</P>
<P>
"As the reform of competitions continues apace, the clubs
should be free to talk to whoever they wish, in order to achieve
the best format for their supporters and for the game as a
whole," he said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
World ruling soccer body FIFA last week threatened national
associations, clubs and players with suspension if they linked up
with the proposed Super League.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Parliament Deliberates Political Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian House of
Representatives (DPR) Friday began the reading of three political
bills, concerning political parties, general elections and the
position/lineup of the DPR, the provincial legislative assemblies
(DPRD) and the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR).
</P>
<P>
The bills were introduced by Minister of Home Affairs Syarwan
Hamid in a plenary session led by Deputy House Speaker Hari
Sabarno, the Jakarta Post reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hari said a special committee of 87 legislators had been
assigned to deliberate the bills together with the government.
</P>
<P>
Syarwan hoped the deliberations would be completed before the
end of December. If the legislature endorsed the bills, "the
government believes the 1999 election will take the nation into a
new era of Indonesian democracy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Once the bills are passed into laws, the people will be
familiarized to enable them to make better preparations for the
general election scheduled for May 1999, Syarwan added.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the present law on political parties which allows only
three parties to contest elections, the proposed new law would
adhere to multiparty precepts, Syarwan said.
</P>
<P>
Every citizen aged above 21 can set up a political party of his
or her own and those aged above 17 -- or less if married -- can
become party members. But all the parties must name the state
ideology Pancasila as their organizational canon.
</P>
<P>
Pancasila is the five basic principles of the Republic of
Indonesia: the belief in the one and only god, just and civilized
humanity, the unity of Indonesia, democracy guided by the inner
wisdom in the unanimity arising out of deliberations amongst
representatives, and social justice for the whole of the people
of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"However, parties are allowed to have their unique
characteristics which are shown and implemented through concrete
party programs," Syarwan said.
</P>
<P>
The bill on political parties also stipulates that members of
the civil servants corps and the Armed Forces are now allowed to
become political party members.
</P>
<P>
To curb the possibility of "money politics", political parties'
financing affairs would also be regulated under the new law.
Foreign donations to parties are banned under the proposed new
law.
</P>
<P>
On qualifications to contest the elections, the existing
political parties -- close to 100 to date -- will be regulated in
the proposed law on the general election.
</P>
<P>
The second bill says a political party needs to have 13
provincial branches and that it must have subbranches in at least
half of the regencies in any province.
</P>
<P>
If a party fails to meet the above requirements, it must have
at least one million signatures from its prospective constituents,
complete with their names and addresses and copies of their
identification cards.
</P>
<P>
On the proposed new law on the MPR/DPR/DPRD structure and
functions, members of the MPR will number 700, compared to the
1,000 at present.
</P>
<P>
The number of DPR members to be elected in the 1999 general
election will be 550, of whom 495 will be elected in the general
election using a district-proportion system and the remaining 55
represent the Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
The DPR at present has 500 members, of whom 425 were elected in
the 1997 general election and 75 represent the Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
The 700 MPR members will consist of the 550 DPR members, 81
indirectly elected regional representatives (three from each of
the 27 provinces) and 69 representatives of religious, racial and
occupational groups.

<HEADLINE> Voter Support for Australia's Opposition Surges in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Australia's key opinion poll,
Newspoll, published Saturday suggest an 11th-hour swing back to
the opposition Labor Party that the opposition could win the
election, the national's leading newspaper The Australian reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Labor's support grew from 42 to 44 percent between last weekend
and midweek at the expense of the ruling coalition, which fell
three points to 40 percent, the newspaper owned by media baron
Rupert Murdoch reported.
</P>
<P>
Newspoll's Sol Lebovic said if his telephone poll is translated
into votes, Labor would have a small majority or the election
result may not be known for days.
</P>
<P>
According to Newspoll, conducted exclusively for The
Australian, on a two-party preferred base, Labor had an
election-winning lead midweek of 53 percent to the coalition's 47
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Newspoll, one of the key opinion polls in the nation, has a
good record of predicting the 1996 election results.
</P>
<P>
In the New South Wales Labor seat Newcastle, 77,000 voters will
not be able to vote for their Lower House representation although
they are still expected to vote for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The death of Democrats candidate Kaye Westbury Friday forced a
postponement of the House of Representatives poll in Newcastle.
</P>
<P>
Wildcards include the level of support for Pauline Hanson's One
Nation Party, contesting its first federal election, and the flow
of its preferences in key marginal seats.
</P>
<P>
Another is the large number of undecided voters, with polls
suggesting up to 10 percent of voters will make up their minds
when they enter the polling booth.
</P>
<P>
If the election is as close as the polls predict, the outcome
may not be known for several days because of the high number of
postal and absentee votes due to the long weekend and school
holidays across the country.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu Focuses on Eliminating Yangtze River Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Jiangsu Province recently issued
a decree ordering 408 serious polluters in the Yangtze River
Valley to meet the discharge control requirements prior to July
1999.
</P>
<P>
The 425-km section of the river in Jiangsu Province is one of
the most heavily populated industrial areas in east China,
according to experts.
</P>
<P>
Local environmental protection departments indicate that the
area is home to well over 20,000 enterprises creating
pollution. Related enterprises discharge vast volumes of
wastewater into the Yangtze each year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the 408 enterprises discharge some 317
million tons of wastewater, 132,300 tons of chemical compounds,
56,700 tons of suspended particles and 2,145 tons of oil-based
residues into the river annually.
</P>
<P>
Pollution levels in the river would fall by some 80 percent if
all the 408 enterprises in the region operate in accordance with
the national ceiling for pollutant discharges, according to
experts.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has ordered enterprises submit
monthly discharge reports and has organized six supervisory groups
to ensure fulfillment of related targets.
</P>
<P>
Some 76 enterprises, or 19 percent of the total, reached
government targets by the end of August, according to local
officials.

<HEADLINE> Voting Begins in Australia's Federal Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Australians began to cast their
ballots Saturday in a federal election to choose a leader guiding
them into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
About 9,000 polling places are open across the nation from
08:00 (22:00 Friday GMT) to 18:00 (08:00 Saturday GMT) for over 12
million voters aged 18 and above.
</P>
<P>
To enable everyone to vote, the Australian Electoral Commission
(AEC) has arranged over 500 mobile polling teams visiting 2,100
hospitals and nursing homes and 120 remote locations.
</P>
<P>
While all ordinary ballot papers, about 88 percent of the total
votes, will be counted Saturday evening, and the initial results
will start appearing at the National Tally Room in Canberra at
about 18:30 (08:30 GMT). But it will take about 13 days for the
AEC to be able to announce the final results as it must wait for
postal votes to arrive from remote areas and overseas.
</P>
<P>
The voters are required to select 148 members of the House of
Representatives from 1,106 candidates, and 40 members of the
Federal Senate from 329 candidates.
</P>
<P>
Under the nation's constitution, to win the election, a party
or a coalition must win at least 75 of the 148 seats of the lower
house, or an absolute majority.
</P>
<P>
The major rivals in the election are the Liberal Party and
National Party coalition led by Prime Minister John Howard and the
Australian Labor Party under the leadership of Kim Beazley.
</P>
<P>
The two contestants for the prime ministership is Howard and
Beazley. The coalition held 95 of the 148 lower house seats before
the election, 20 more than the minimum majority required, while
the Labor Party had only 48 seats.
</P>
<P>
In other words, a loss of at least 21 seats or more in
Saturday's election from the coalition would lead to the defeat of
the coalition, while an extra 27 seats are needed for the Labor
Party to win the election with an overall swing of about 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts and even the Labor Party said last week that it was
highly likely for the Labor to capture that amount of seats.
</P>
<P>
Conventional wisdom tells that since 1932 no opposition could
defeat the government in Australia after only one-term.
</P>
<P>
But Australia's key opinion poll, Newspoll, published Saturday,
suggests an 11th-hour swing back to the opposition Labor Party
indicates that Labor could win the election.
</P>
<P>
Labor's support grew from 42 to 44 percent between last weekend
and midweek at the expense of the ruling coalition, which fell
three points to 40 percent, the newspaper owned by media baron
Rupert Murdoch reported.
</P>
<P>
On a two-party preferred base, Labor had an election-winning
lead midweek of 53 percent to the coalition's 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
While another election-eve opinion poll, published Saturday by
The Sydney Morning Herald and the Melbourne-based newspaper The
Age, has found the coalition maintained its slender two-point
primary vote lead over Labor, but split the two-party preferred
vote 50-50.
</P>
<P>
The tight opinion results indicate the second preference votes
are vital for the final results as every vote counts.
</P>
<P>
Both the coalition and the opposition appealed to the
supporters of the One Nation Party in the past week for their
second preference votes.
</P>
<P>
Under the nation's preferential voting system, voters are
required to rank candidates in order of preference on the ballot
papers. To be elected, a candidate must achieve an absolute
majority, that is, at least 50 percent plus one vote, either on
first preference or following distribution of preference votes.
</P>
<P>
If no candidate has more than half of the votes, the candidate
with the fewest votes is excluded. The excluded candidate's votes
are transferred to the other candidates according to the second
preferences shown by voters on the ballot papers.
</P>
<P>
This process of excluding candidates one by one, continues
until one candidate has more than half the total votes and is
declared elected.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Put Out of Grand Slam Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 2 (Xinhua)-- Top-ranked Swiss sensation Martina
Hingis was stopped by Patty Schnyder in an all-Swiss semi-final
of the Grand Slam Cup tennis tournament in Munich as she retired
with injury at the deciding set on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Schnyder will face American Venus Williams in the final who
outpowered Wimbledon finalist Nathalie Tauziat of France.
</P>
<P>
After 5-7, 7-5 in the first two sets, Hingis did not show sign
of frustration after she pulled out with cramp at 5-5 in the
deciding set.
</P>
<P>
"There was not much point in going on and risking an injury,"
said Hingis, in danger of losing her number one spot to American
Lindsay Davenport next week in Filderstadt, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Williams, who had lost to Tauziat in both their previous
encounters, was in a class of her own this time, cracking down
five aces and committing few unforced errors on her way to a
comfortable 6-4, 6-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
Andre Agassi extended his impressive run in the men's
competition by beating Australian Open champion Petr Korda in
Friday's quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, who had whitewashed Frenchman Cedric Pioline in his
opening match, relied on blistering returns and powerful
groundstrokes to tame Czech Korda 4-6, 6-0, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
The former world number one, who received a wild card for the
Munich indoor event, will now meet Karol Kucera for a place in
Sunday's final.
</P>
<P>
Slovakia's Kucera, who beat Agassi in five sets in the fourth
round of this year's U.S. Open, won a gripping battle with
Croatian Goran Ivanisevic 5-7, 6-4, 8-6.
</P>
<P>
The other men's semi-final will be an intriguing clash of
styles between Chilean baseliner Marcelo Rios, the world number
three, and hard-hitting Australian Mark Philippoussis, the U.S.
Open runner-up.

<HEADLINE> New Study Shows Vitamin E Good for Heart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 2 (Xinhua) -- A team of U.S. researchers
have found in new studies on mice that vitamin E gives "potent
protection" from heart disease.
</P>
<P>
In a report published in the October issue of Nature Medicine,
a scientific and medical journal, the team of scientists from the
University of Pennsylvania reported that they fed mice vitamin E
for four months and found that the animals had 40 percent less
damage to cardiovascular tissues than untreated specimens.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the increased oxidative stress in the
mouse is of functional importance in the evolution of
atherosclerosis and that can be suppressed by oral administration
of vitamin E.
</P>
<P>
The study offers "powerful evidence" that vitamin E works
effectively as an antioxidant against atherosclerosis, a form of
arteriosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries, said the
researchers.
</P>
<P>
It also demonstrates the role of harmful free radicals in heart
disease. Free radicals are molecules that can destabilize other
molecules in the body, contributing to a number of diseases and
illnesses, they said.
</P>
<P>
Vitamin E has been the subject of a growing number of studies
in the United States that show it has a positive effect against a
broad range of health problems. Vitamin E in its natural form is
made from soybeans.

<HEADLINE> Facts &AMP; Figures (3): Political Parties of Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The following is a brief
introduction to the major political parties of Australia:
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Party of Australia (LP):
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Party of Australia was founded in 1944, uniting the
many different political organizations. The LP has become
Australia's most successful post-war party. It fought its first
election in 1946 with some success and in 1947, the LP won state
elections in the states of Western Australia, South Australia and
Victoria.
</P>
<P>
The LP ruled the country in coalition with the National Party
for 23 years from 1949 to 1972 and for another term of more than
seven years from 1975 to 1983. In 1996, Australians elected the
Liberal Party, in coalition with the National Party of Australia,
to govern Australia.
</P>
<P>
The LP advocates private enterprise, conservative financial
policies, social justice, individual liberty and initiative, and
is committed to national development, prosperity and security, and
cooperation with the United States and the British Commonwealth.
Its leader is John Howard.
</P>
<P>
The National Party of Australia - NPA:
</P>
<P>
The National Party of Australia was founded in 1916 as the
Country Party of Australia, changed its name to the National
Country Party in 1974 and adopted the present name in 1982.
Members of the NPA have swelled to 80,000.
</P>
<P>
The NPA is a conservative, private enterprise organization and
represents Australian country. It provides a vital balance in
conservative politics, ensuring the interests of people living
beyond the big capital cities are taken into full account in all
policies. It advocates balanced national development within a
system of free enterprise to address rural and farming issues.
</P>
<P>
The NPA ruled the country in coalition with the Liberal Party
for 23 years from 1949 to 1972, and in 1996 again re-elected by
the Australian people to govern Australia in coalition with the
Liberal Party. Its leader is Tim Fischer.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Labor Party (ALP):
</P>
<P>
The Australian Labor Party was founded in 1891 by the trade
union movement and remains one of the few parties in the world to
retain a formal affiliation with trade unions. The ALP, the
largest and the first modern political party in Australia, was a
ruling party on 11 occasions since 1904, including one from 1983
to 1996.
</P>
<P>
The ALP was formed as a laborist party to represent the working
class and the labor movement in parliament. It advocates an
independent foreign policy, racial and gender equality, and
increased rights for the nation's Aboriginal population. Kim
Beazley is leader of the ALP.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Democrats Party:
</P>
<P>
The Australian Democrats Party is a modern socialist group
formed in 1977 by a reformist Liberal cabinet minister. The
Australian Democrats Party comprises former Liberal Movement and
the Australia Party. The party, which holds seven seats in the
76-member federal Senate, focuses on contemporary issues rather
than a set agenda. Its leader is Meg Lees, replacing former
leader Cheryl Kernot, who defected to the Labor Party in October
1997.
</P>
<P>
The One Nation Party:
</P>
<P>
The One Nation Party was launched in Ipswich, Queensland state,
on April 11, 1997 by federal MP Pauline Hanson, who advocates cuts
in intake of Asian immigrants and in government welfare funding to
disadvantaged Aborigines.

<HEADLINE> Facts &AMP; Figures (4): Brief History of Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The following is a brief
history of Australia:
</P>
<P>
The British made their first appearance in Australia in 1688.
British navigator James Cook sighted and made a visit to the
southern shore of the Australian mainland in 1770.
</P>
<P>
In 1786 the British government decided to colonize the
continent, which led to a great immigration. The first group of
immigrants, numbering 1,030 (including 736 convicts in exile),
under Captain Arthur Phillip, reached the east coast near Sydney
and established the first colony there.
</P>
<P>
The continent was named Australia in 1817. By the end of the
19th century, six colonies had been set up in Australia.
</P>
<P>
The British Parliament adopted The Constitution of the
Commonwealth of Australia in 1900. In the next year, the six
colonies became states and were federated as a self-rule
territory, under the name of the Commonwealth of Australia. On May
9 in the same year, the first session of the Australian Parliament
was convened in Melbourne. The capital was moved to Canberra in
1927.
</P>
<P>
Under the Westminster Bill passed by the British Parliament in
1931, Australia gained the right to act independently in the
domestic and foreign areas, and was claimed an independent state
in the Commonwealth.

<HEADLINE> 7th World Economic Development Congress Concludes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,200 ministers and
senior executives from 80 countries concluded their three-day here
Friday after a series of discussions focusing on the promotion and
implementation of infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
During the 7th World Economic Development Congress, which
opened on September 30, five industrial summits were also held,
which included the Private Power Summit, the Global Gas &AMP; LNG
Summit, the Global Telecommunications Summit, the Transportation
Infrastructure Summit and the Water Supply &AMP; Wastewater Summit.
</P>
<P>
The discussions and consultations were held to rethink
development strategies and developing closer cooperation between
the investment financers and project developers for infrastructure
construction in developing nations in the aftermath of the Asian
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Three special briefings for infrastructure in China, India and
Brazil, the three world's largest developing countries, were
convened during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote speech at the special session about China's
infrastructure, Xiang Huaicheng, the Chinese finance minister,

<HEADLINE> U.S., DPRK End Talks on Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The two-day missile talks
between the Unite States and the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) ended here Friday with both sides disagreeing on
major points.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by State Department spokesman James Rubin
said the U.S. delegation stressed that it regarded "as highly
destabilizing the DPRK's attempt on August 31 to use a Taepo Dong
1 missile to orbit a small satellite."
</P>
<P>
"We told the North that we fully shared Japan's deep concern
about the flight test, which overflew Japanese territory without
prior notification," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The United States also voiced its strong opposition to the
DPRK's missile exports to other countries," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Such exports, including the sale of medium-range ballistic
missile equipment and technology, have heightened tensions in
already-unstable regions of the world," it added.
</P>
<P>
"The United States made clear to the DPRK that further launches
of long-range missiles or further exports of such missiles or
their related technology would have very negative consequences for
efforts to improve U.S.-North Korean relations," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
The statement claimed that the U.S. reiterated its
determination "to safeguard the security of U.S. friends and
allies and U.S. forces in Northeast Asia."
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, the U.S. delegation emphasized that if the
DPRK is prepared to cease its missile activities of concern, there
could be a commensurate improvement in its relations with the
United States," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the head of the DPRK delegation told reporters that
"even though there was sincere dialogue, there was no agreement
between the two parties." He added that the U.S. side was "against
almost all subjects (raised by the DPRK) during the talks."
</P>
<P>
"The DPRK raised the issue of the right to launch of satellite
which was recognized internationally," said Hang Chang On,
director of the Department of U.S. Affairs of the DPRK Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"We told them that the launch of satellite is the natural right
for a country to explore space peacefully," Hang said in Korean.
</P>
<P>
"We told them openly we will continue to launch satellite in
the future for the purpose of peaceful exploration of space," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation was led by Robert Einhorn, deputy assistant
secretary of state for political-military affairs.
</P>
<P>
This was the third round of missile talks between the two
countries. Previous rounds were held in April 1996 and June 1997.
</P>
<P>
This week's meetings were the result of an agreement reached
during high-level talks in New York between August 21 and
September 5.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that they will hold another round of
missile talks "at the earliest practical date," Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Says Strike May Happen in Kosovo Within 2 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen Friday said Belgrade should stop fighting in Kosovo
immediately, otherwise it will face military strikes from the West
within less than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a closed meeting with some of the
House members, Cohen said Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
must call a cease-fire and pull Serb forces out of the areas of
fighting against the separatists.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the NATO allies have been dealing with Milosevic for
some time now and recognize that he always tries to simply pull
back at the last moment only to have the capacity to engage in...
atrocious behavior" again, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any of the NATO allies are going to be satisfied
if he simply stops the killing momentarily," he added.
</P>
<P>
"This is not an ad hoc approach he can take and pick and choose
a la carte," Cohen said. "He must accept the entire set of
demands. Otherwise, he will face the use of force."
</P>
<P>
Cohen said he is tentatively planning to attend a NATO meeting
in Brussels, Belgium, Wednesday when a decision is expected on
whether to approve force. If he attends, it could turn into a full
ministerial meeting instead of permanent representatives.
</P>
<P>
Cohen noted that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
may take military actions in Kosovo within two weeks if Serbia
does not fulfill its promise.
</P>
<P>
"I believe action, if it's required, will take place before
that time -- that there will not be a two-week hiatus between now
and the time that would be necessary to provide relief for the
people who are currently suffering," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Russian President Boris Yeltsin Friday voiced his
strong opposition to the use of force by NATO in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, President Bill Clinton said he hoped
Yugoslavia got the message that the West is prepared for military
strikes unless he stops violence against ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We have to be very, very strong here," Clinton told reporters
at a news conference on the U.S. and world economy. "We need to
stop the violence, get a negotiated settlement, and work our way
through this."
</P>
<P>
"We don't want thousands upon thousands of people to be caught
up in a war or to starve or freeze this winter because they have
been displaced. And we are working very, very hard on it," Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
Washington is pushing for a diplomatic solution but has made
clear that NATO is ready to act if no negotiated settlement is
reached.
</P>
<P>
"We have been working for months and months -- I have
personally been working for months -- first of all, to get NATO
and then to get the U.N. to send a message to Mr. Milosevic to
stop the violence," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton indicated he believed there would be a consensus among
NATO's 16 members on the use of force, however, to stop the crisis
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that our allies in Europe are with us and I think
that we all understand and we hope he (Milosevic) got the
message," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council last week adopted a resolution
calling for an immediate cease-fire. U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan has been asked to speed completion of a report on
Milosevic's compliance with U.N. demands on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
NATO wants the report before it makes a decision on further
action, possibly next Wednesday, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the threat of force may be what it takes to get
Milosevic to rein in his forces, saying the same was needed in the
Bosnian conflict.
</P>
<P>
"We saw in Bosnia what works in dealing with Mr. Milosevic," he
said. "We cannot allow this conflict to spread again and risk what
we stopped in Bosnia starting again in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that the situation in Kosovo is different
from Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"The Kosovo situation is somewhat different, in that Kosovo is
actually a part of Serbia, although by law it's supposed to be
autonomous," Clinton said.

William Cohen said Belgrade should not be given any maneuvering
room, and he urged the Yugoslav authorities to stop fighting in
Kosovo immediately.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a closed meeting with some of the
House members, Cohen said Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
must call a cease-fire and pull Serb forces out of the areas of
fighting against the separatists.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the NATO allies have been dealing with Milosevic for
some time now and recognize that he always tries to simply pull
back at the last moment only to have the capacity to engage in...
atrocious behavior" again, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any of the NATO allies are going to be satisfied
if he simply stops the killing momentarily," he added.
</P>
<P>
"This is not an ad hoc approach he can take and pick and choose
a la carte," Cohen said. "He must accept the entire set of
demands. Otherwise, he will face the use of force."
</P>
<P>
Cohen said he is tentatively planning to attend a NATO meeting
in Brussels, Belgium, Wednesday when a decision is expected on
whether to approve force. If he attends, it could turn into a full
ministerial meeting instead of permanent representatives.
</P>
<P>
"I believe action, if it's required, will take place before
that time -- that there will not be a two-week hiatus between now
and the time that would be necessary to provide relief for the
people who are currently suffering," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, President Bill Clinton said he hoped
Yugoslavia got the message that the West is prepared for military
strikes unless he stops violence against ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We have to be very, very strong here," Clinton told reporters
at a news conference on the U.S. and world economy. "We need to
stop the violence, get a negotiated settlement, and work our way
through this."
</P>
<P>
"We don't want thousands upon thousands of people to be caught
up in a war or to starve or freeze this winter because they have
been displaced. And we are working very, very hard on it," Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
Washington is pushing for a diplomatic solution but has made
clear that NATO is ready to act if no negotiated settlement is
reached.
</P>
<P>
"We have been working for months and months -- I have
personally been working for months -- first of all, to get NATO
and then to get the U.N. to send a message to Mr. Milosevic to
stop the violence," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton indicated he believed there would be a consensus among
NATO's 16 members on the use of force, however, to stop the crisis
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that our allies in Europe are with us and I think
that we all understand and we hope he (Milosevic) got the
message," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council last week adopted a resolution
calling for an immediate cease-fire. U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan has been asked to speed completion of a report on
Milosevic's compliance with U.N. demands on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
NATO wants the report before it makes a decision on further
action, possibly next Wednesday, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the threat of force may be what it takes to get
Milosevic to rein in his forces, saying the same was needed in the
Bosnian conflict.
</P>
<P>
"We saw in Bosnia what works in dealing with Mr. Milosevic," he
said. "We cannot allow this conflict to spread again and risk what
we stopped in Bosnia starting again in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that the situation in Kosovo is different
from Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"The Kosovo situation is somewhat different, in that Kosovo is
actually a part of Serbia, although by law it's supposed to be
autonomous," Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Albright Expresses Concern at Situation in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Friday expressed her concern at the situation
in Russia, saying Washington is not yet reassured that Russia's
new government has a cogent economic plan for the country.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the U.S.-Russia Business Council in Chicago,
Albright said that he believes the crisis there will not soon
abate.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot yet say we are reassured... So we cannot say with
confidence that Russia will emerge from its difficulties anytime
soon," she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright said she is "deeply concerned about what is happening
in Russia" and "will not downplay Russia's present crisis or
suggest Russian reformers have made all the right choices. It is a
troubling fact that many Russians have come to equate reform with
theft."
</P>
<P>
She said "the best way to help Russia now is not necessarily to
send more money."
</P>
<P>
"More big bailouts are not by themselves going to restore
investor confidence in Russia... In the long run, the gap between
Russia's needs and its resources must be met not by foreign
bailouts but by foreign investment," she said.
</P>
<P>
"We have heard a lot of talk in recent days about printing new
money, indexing wages, imposing price and capital controls and
restoring state management of parts of the economy," she added.
</P>
<P>
Albright said, "We can only wonder if some members of (new
Prime Minister Yevgeny) Primakov's team understand the basic
arithmetic of the global economy."
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Russian President Boris Yeltsin warned the Russian
government on Friday he would step in to defend economic freedoms
if ministers tried to bring down a new "Iron Curtain" of control
in their efforts to halt a financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's press secretary Dmitry Yakushkin said Yeltsin would
protect the Russian people if an anti-crisis plan which Yevgeny
Primakov's government is working on violated their rights.
</P>
<P>
"If there is a threat that citizens' rights, including economic
ones, might be violated, then in this case, his reaction would be
very tough," Yakushkin said.
</P>
<P>
"If we take actions like banning dollars, the president
understands perfectly what this ban would mean -- it would mean
the violation of many of our rights...a return to the Iron
Curtain."

<HEADLINE> Albania Calls for NATO Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Foreign Minister
Paskal Milo Friday called for NATO intervention in Kosovo and said
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic should be held responsible
for genocide and investigating for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 53rd General Assembly session, Milo said that
immediate NATO action is necessary "because of the failure of the
peaceful means applied by the international community so far."
</P>
<P>
"It is high time for the U.N. and other international
organizations to urgently intervene for the restoration of peace,
otherwise we risk to have another wider conflict," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Albanian foreign minister accused Milosevic of
ordering "the implementation of his ethnic cleansing policy
against Albanians under the pretext of combating the so-called
Albanian terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Kosovo Albanians have fled to Albania and
thousands more were wandering Kosovo's forests and mountains,
creating an acute humanitarian crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic told a
press conference here that Albania has provided arms, finance and
training for the terrorists in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council Thursday condemned recent
massacres of civilians in Kosovo, Serbian's province of mainly
ethnic Albanians, but the council did not assign blame and added
no new legal backing for any NATO action.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Milo accused Serbian propaganda of trying to
justify indiscriminate attacks and the massacre of ethnic
Albanians -- just as it did in Bosnia -- by making false
accusations of terrorist activity.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister told a press conference that he is "not
satisfied with" the latest U.N. resolution. "I want it to be much
stronger," he added.
</P>
<P>
"It is just the right time for the international community to
send a stronger message to President Milosevic" that the world
will no longer tolerate his mass shooting of civilians, he said.
However, Belgrade has said that it has nothing to do with the
alleged massacre.
</P>
<P>
Milo insists that his government wants a peaceful end to the
Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
"We are in favor of an immediate end of the conflict and the
initiation of the negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina, with
an international involvement as a third party," he said. "This
would guarantee their success. The negotiations should define the
future status of Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government believes a solution "should take into
consideration the request of the will of the Albanians to
self-determination and respect for the international conventions
which reject the violent changing of borders," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population of 2
million, and they have been seeking independence by fighting Serbs
in the southernmost province of Serbia, the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets End Week with Volatility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Fears of a global recession, a
weak U.S. dollar and talk of further hedge fund collapses all
contributed to keeping the pressure on European markets, which
ended the week with a generally volatile session.
</P>
<P>
Banking shares fell across Europe, with UBS in Zurich and ING
in Amsterdam leading the collapse. UBS shares have lost 60 percent
of their value this year.
</P>
<P>
The shares rallied a little after a morning plunge, but Wall
Street losses weighed on the minor rebounds, driving shares
sharply lower in the last minutes of trade.
</P>
<P>
The London blue chip shares plunged to their worst levels of
the year as the relentless selling continued unabated throughout
the session. The FTSE 100 finished 157.8 lower at 4750.4, the
lowest closing level of 1998, falling more than 300 points in the
past two days.
</P>
<P>
The index had been down as low at 4724.2 earlier today, which
was its weakest intra-day level all year.
</P>
<P>
The market was gripped by fears that the depression in Japan
and renewed signs of weakness in Russia and Latin American could
spill over into a world recession next year.
</P>
<P>
Despite relatively steady Asian markets overnight, dealers took
initial bearish cues from another slide on Wall Street and reports
of the latest hedge fund casualty in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Dutch banking giant ABN Amro, meanwhile, today became the
latest high profile European company to warn on profits.
</P>
<P>
"The trouble is that confidence has been shot to pieces and
people are really shellshocked," said Richard Grossman, a
stockbroker at Redmayne Bentley.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, Germany's stock exchange continued its meltdown,
dropping 75.31 points closing at 4019.31. The Xetra Dax had pushed
under its previous year low of 4053.89 points, to 3855, during the
day.
</P>
<P>
In the last few months the Dax has lost 35 percent of its
value. A litany of bad news going back to mid-August has
contributed to undermine investor confidence, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian financial crisis and its fallout in the German
banking sector, Japan's failure to reform its financial house are
all playing their part in the global financial meltdown.
</P>
<P>
The recent bail-outs of hedge funds, and the International
Monetary Fund's refusal this week to rule out a coming global
slump are also negative factors.
</P>
<P>
The world's economic woes are magnified on the Frankfurt stock
exchange, where investors show a "disproportional reaction to
events compared with the U.S. and Japan," according to a European
equities analyst at Trinkaus Capital in Dusseldorf.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the French Cac 40 index rebounded from heavy losses
to finish at a point up at 3,039, little changed from its opening
level.
</P>
<P>
But France's benchmark stock index is now below where it opened
trading at the beginning of the year. Paris traders say the index
could drop at least another 200 points because investors are
lacking confidence.
</P>
<P>
Banking shares continued their slide, led by Paribas followed
by Societe Generale.

<HEADLINE> Contact Group Urges Belgrade to Comply with UN Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The Contact Group on former
Yugoslavia Friday called on the Yugoslav government to comply with
a U.N. resolution demanding the pullout of Serbian forces from
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after a one-day talks in London,
diplomats from the United States, Britain, Germany, France, Italy
and Russia said that time was running out for Belgrade and agreed
that more measures would have to be taken.
</P>
<P>
Russia, a traditional ally of Serbia, has objected to the
threat of NATO airstrikes against Serbia but an official of
British Foreign Office said Moscow's representative at Friday's
talks "made no complaint at all".
</P>
<P>
The British official told reporters that if anyone thought that
(Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic was edging towards
compliance with the U.N. by withdrawing some troops from Kosovo
they were deluding themselves.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group also made clear that it was united in
condemning recent massacres in Kosovo and had endorsed a revised
paper drawn up by U.S. mediator Christopher Hill that will be put
to the Serbs and Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leadership as the
blueprint for a political settlement to the conflict.

<HEADLINE> Hundreds of Egyptian Couples Wed Lock Near Pyramids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Having fun and saving money, 250
young couples tied the knots Friday night near the Great Pyramids
of Giza at a grandiose mass wedding party hosted by the Egyptian
government.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony, which was heralded in by a parade by the young
couples on the boulevard leading to the Pyramids, is part of a
host of festivities marking the Silver Jubilee of Egypt's victory
against Israel in the 1973 October 6 War.
</P>
<P>
The climax came when the couples, brides dressed in white
wedding gownsand and bridegrooms in dark suits, hailed by their
relatives and friends, swung into the dance floor, dancing to
disco and later folk music, wafting in the Sphinx Club, against
the glittering sound and light show in front of the reclining
half-man-half-lion giant stone statue.
</P>
<P>
Hosni Ghazi, deputy director of the Sports and Youth Authority
in Giza, told reporters at a press conference early this week that
the aim was to help young people struggling to cope with the high
cost of getting married.
</P>
<P>
"Our intention is to help those who can not afford the
celebrations of the night of their life," Ghazi said.
</P>
<P>
"But we have been getting requests from well-off couples who
just want to join the experience of the night," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to officials in charge of the Pyramids, the event is
part of the celebrations of the 1973 war, the year in which many
of the couples were born. A bride who was born on October 6 has
been chosen to cut the eight-tiered cake.
</P>
<P>
Up to 7,000 guests attended the ceremony at which singers
performed without a fee and couples received gifts donated by
sponsors.
</P>
<P>
One businessman is offering 500 television sets. Another is
giving refrigerators and washing machines.
</P>
<P>
The government has been organizing mass weddings around Egypt
since 1992.

JERUSALEM -- The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) imposed another
total closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip for fear of possible
terrorist attacks, it was officially announced here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The closure started at 2:00 p.m. local time (1200 GMT) Friday
and will last till next Tuesday, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
The IDF made this decision based on the reports that during the
Israel's Succot holidays (celebrating harvest), the Palestinian
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) would carry out attacks
against targets in Israel, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli defense establishment discussed security situation
in the territories and decided to get prepared for eventualities.
Whether the total closure would continue after next Tuesday will
be decided by IDF, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
Total closure means closing all checkpoints, passes and
crossing points between Israel and the Palestinian territories,
banning Palestinians from entering Israel and shutting down all
business including trade and transportations between the two
sides. (BC-Israel-Closure)

BEIRUT -- Representatives of Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei are on a secret visit to Lebanon to improve relations
with Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual leader of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
A source close to Hezbollah, or Party of God, told Xinhua
Friday that the Iranian delegation, led by Hojateslam Hijazi, also
aims to improve Fadlallah's ties with Hezbollah's leadership.
</P>
<P>
The cleric's relation with Iran started to sour especially
after the death of one of the grand religious leaders of the
Shiite Muslims, Al-Sayed Abu Al-Kasem Al-Khoui, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Fadlallah's assertion of his authority as spiritual leader of
the Shiites and his unconventional teaching methods were not
welcomed by some religious and political figures in Tehran.
