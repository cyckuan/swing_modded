<HEADLINE> New "Mad Cow" Case Found in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The French Agriculture Ministry said
today that it has identified a new case of "mad cow" disease,
formally known as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), in
central France.
</P>
<P>
The case, the ninth this year and the 22nd since 1990, was
found in a herd of 155 cows of a diary farm in the Cantal region
south of Clermont Ferrand, and the herd in question has been
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Scientists found that BSE, which reached epidemic proportions
in the late 1980s, was caused by feeding cattle the remains of
sheeps that had been infected with scrapie, their own version of
the disease.
</P>
<P>
The disease reportedly continues to infect British herds
despite a government ban on using feed containing animal protein
</P>
<P>
After a possible link was discovered between BSE and the human
brain-wasting disease Creutzfeldt-Jacobs Disease, the European
Union adopted an overall ban on March 27 this year against
Britain's beef exports.

<HEADLINE> Large-scale AIDS Vaccine Tests on Humans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Though an AIDS vaccine is possible,
it is too early to begin large-scale tests on humans, an expert
told the 11th International AIDS Conference in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
"HIV is simply too complex and wily an opponent" to be beaten
by the simple types of vaccines that controlled polio and
smallpox, said Dr. John Moore of the U.S. Aaron Diamond AIDS
Research Center.
</P>
<P>
"While recent studies show vaccinations can protect chimpanzees
and tests are indicating humans can be immunized safely, many
fundamental questions need to be answered," he was quoted as
saying by a local press report today.
</P>
<P>
There has been reports that the first large trial of AIDS
inoculation is scheduled to begin next year in northern Thailand.
</P>
<P>
But Dr. Edward Mbidde of the Uganda Cancer Institute argued
that AIDS is such a threat to the developing world that "we need
anything that would make a dent in the epidemic."
</P>
<P>
"Even a vaccine with low efficacy will help," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that over 10,000 people, 90 percent of them in
developing world, are infected with AIDS virus each day.

<HEADLINE> "Mad Cow" Crisis to Cost EU 2.1 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The beef industry crisis, stirred
up by the British "mad cow" fears which plagued eventually the
whole world, will cost the European Union (EU) some 2.1 billion
U.S. dollars, EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler said
today.
</P>
<P>
Fischler blamed beef traders for their failure to pass on the
sharp fall in beef prices to consumers, an act which could have
helped bring consumption back to pre-crisis levels and make up the
huge losses EU suffered.
</P>
<P>
Though the European Commission has so far taken 120,000 metric
tons of beef off the market under its intervention procedures and
even 600,000 tons by the end of the year, the market, the key
solution to the crisis, should never be neglected, he added.
</P>
<P>
The EU no longer has the option of offloading beef stocks onto
world markets because of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT) rules restricting on export subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Fischler said the EU commission is urgently examining ways of
cutting production and boosting consumption, adding that without
additional radical and immediate action to cut beef production and
boost consumption, "the situation can only deteriorate further."
</P>
<P>
Beef consumption in the EU has fallen by 11 percent since the
British government's announcement in March of a possible link
between bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and a fatal human
brain disease, which kicked off a "mad cow" crisis worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The wholesale beef prices fell by 7 to 14 percent which
influenced the retail prices in most European countries.

<HEADLINE> Germany Extends Ban on British Beef Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Germany has reiterated its strong
stance on the "mad cow" issue today by extending indefinitely a
total ban against imports of beef and beef products from Britain
and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
For fear of the possible human version of "mad cow" disease,
the German government adopted an emergency measure on March 28 to
ban Britain's beef exports.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Ministry said in a statement today that Germany
had decided that the measure which will be expired on September 29
will be ratified by the Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament,
to be an indefinite one.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) agreed last month to ease its overall
ban against British beef on condition that London carrys out a
program to eradicate "mad cow" disease, formally known as bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
</P>
<P>
However, five of the EU's 15 member nations, including Germany,
the main force against lifting the ban, voted against the decision
and refused to carry it out.
</P>
<P>
A panel of experts from the European Commission, or the EU's
executive arm, and EU member states are to visit Britain on July
22 to inspect implementation of Britain's eradication program.

ROME, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Sicilian police said today they
had arrested 41 suspects on Mafia charges in their latest
operation against a ring allegedly responsible for numerous

<HEADLINE> U.S., Japan Start Photo Film Talks in Geneva </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators from the United States
and Japan started on Wednesday an initial round of bilateral talks
under the auspices of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to sort
out a photo film trade dispute between them.
</P>
<P>
The talks, sought by the United States as the first step to set
in motion the dispute settlement procedure of the WTO, will be
held in Geneva, where the WTO based, for two days, trade officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Washington filed a complaint with the WTO on June 13, accusing
the Japanese government of "unreasonable practices" that lock out
foreign products from the Japanese consumer photo film and paper
market.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth complaint filed by the U.S. against Japan
since establishment of the WTO in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
"The essence of the U.S. complaint is that the government of
Japan intentionally created a set of interlocking barriers (to
foreign film products) to counteract its commitments under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and other
international agreements," said U.S. chief negotiator James
Southwick Wednesday at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
"Those barrier continue to be in place and continue to restrict
market access," added Southwick, who is also U.S. Deputy Assistant
Trade Representative for Japan.
</P>
<P>
Washington took the case to the WTO after an 11-month
investigation into U.S. Film maker Eastman Kodak Co's petition
charging that Japan's Fuji Photo Film Co. and the Japanese
government have been collaborating to block access to the Japanese
market.
</P>
<P>
Specificly, Washington complained that Japan's Premiums and
Misrepresentation Law restricts the use of sales incentives by
foreign companies trying to break into Japanese market.
</P>
<P>
It also argued that the Large-Scale Retail Store Law of Japan,
which regulates the size and operating hours of department stores
and other large retailers, constitutes a serious barrier for Kodak
and other foreign companies, violating WTO's General Agreement on
Trade in Services.
</P>
<P>
Accord to Southwick, the consultations will start with the
second issue Wednesday afternoon and will tackle the first issue
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese officials expect to prove that there is no
discrimination against foreign products in the Japanese market.
They will also try to show that the retail store law doesn't
violate the services agreement and has nothing to do with a
decline in Kodak's Japanese market share, trade sources here said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. also demands bilateral talks with Japan outside of WTO
dispute settlement proceedings to discuss what it considers to be
restrictive private-sector business practices in Japan.
</P>
<P>
However, according to Southwick, the two sides were unable to
schedule this consultation in this round and he hoped that they
could enter into consultations on this issue in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. negotiator declined to speculate on what kind of
outcome could be expected from this round of talks. "We'll try to
explaining our views and address questions from the other side.
Beyond that it is difficult to predict," he said.
</P>
<P>
If the bilateral talks can not reach an agreement within 60
days, The U.S. can ask the WTO to set up a panel to rule over the
dispute.

<P>
CHENGDU, Sichuan Province, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Sichuan Quanxing
repeated its Sunday's 3-2 win over the Chinese Army in the second
leg competition at the second round of Chinese Soccer Association
Cup here on Wednesday, advancing to the quarter-finals with an
aggregate 6-4 victory.
</P>
<P>
Quanxing, a fifth placer in the national league which laid off
after its first round robin competition, placed emphasis on
defence with a first leg win in hands while the Chinese Army also
played a very cautious game.
</P>
<P>
The deadlock was not broken until the 42nd minute when Zou
Yougen opened the scoring for Quanxing with a header.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's Andre added the second one minute later after a
brilliant combination with teammate Penxiaofang to give Quanxing a
2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Army struggled to score its first goal by Zhao
Jialin just before the break.
</P>
<P>
National player Hao Haidong managed to equal the score on an
error of Quanxing only seconds into the second half.
</P>
<P>
Quanxing's win came in the 65th minute when another Brasilian
Marmelo headed home a cross from his teammate.
</P>
<P>
The referee showed a total of four red cards and nine yellow
cards throughout the match, which was interrupted for about 10
minutes by the rows in field between the two sides.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Says Food Distribution Plan Ready for UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council's
sanctions committee has completed the final draft of procedures of
Iraq's limited oil exports and imports of humanitarian supplies in
accordance with the Iraqi-U.N. oil-for-food deal, the Iraqi News
Agency (INA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The INA quoted German Ambassador Antonius Eitel, head of the
U.N. sanctions committee, as expressing his belief that approvals
of the committee member-states will reach the United Nations
within two days for final endorsement Friday.
</P>
<P>
Following Iraq's presentation of its food distribution plan to
the U.N., the United States which takes a tough stance on Iraq has
opposed the plan. It accused Iraq of trying to translate the plan
into other purposes. Iraq has blamed the U.S. for impeding the
immediate implementation of the Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
The German ambassador attributed the delay in the formulation
of the draft plan to the sensitive issues related to the respect of
Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity, the INA said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's chief negotiator to the Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food talks
stressed that both Iraq and the U.N. are keen to ensure the quick
implementation of the memorandum of understanding reached by Iraq
and the U.N. on May 20.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the memorandum of understanding, Iraq is
permitted to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil over six
months to but its desperately needed food, medicine and other
humanitarian materials. Iraq must obtain the Security Council's
approval of its food distribution plan before the oil-for-food
deal goes into effect.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Military Not Welcome in Okinawa: Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Okinawan governor Masahide Ota told
Japan's Supreme Court here today that the Okinawan people now are
tired of the U.S. military presence on the island.
</P>
<P>
Ota appeared before the court's all 15 judges to defend his
refusal to cooperate with the Japanese government over its drive
to renew leases to the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
He said that his decision resulted from his responsibility to
protect the Okinawa's islanders.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa has long borne an unfair share of the U.S. military
presence in Japan, said he, adding that Tokyo should stop the
policy that forces the islanders to lease their land.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa hosts some 75 percent of the 47,000 U.S. troops in
Japan, and the U.S. bases amount to 20 percent of its area.
</P>
<P>
The people of Okinawa have long complained about the heavy
concentration of the U.S. bases on the island, but it was the rape
of an Okinawan schoolgirl by three U.S. servicemen last year that
sparked the landowners' protests against the continued U.S.
military presence on the island, 1,600 kilometers southwest of
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Under the growing pressure from Okinawa, the United States has
agreed with Japan in April to reduce about 20 percent of the land
it currently uses in Okinawa in the coming five years.

He also expressed concern over the Islamist party's rise to
power in Turkey, a country which wants to have closer relations
with Europe.
</P>
<P>
"This is something which concerns Cyprus, Europe and the
United States," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Turkey sent troops and took control of the northern third of
Cyprus in 1974 following a short-lived coup by Greek Cypriots
seeking union with Greece. The island has been divided since
then.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 50,000 residents and
tourists on the barrier islands in North Carolina began to
evacuate Wednesday, expecting Hurricane Bertha to land the eastern
coastal area soon.
</P>
<P>
Emergency officials in South Carolina also urged residents to
leave coastal Beaufort County, fearing that storm surges could
wash out bridges and low-lying areas, the Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
The evacuation came as the entire Carolinas' coast and part of
Georgia were under a hurricane watch, expecting Bertha, packing
105 mph winds, to come close to the area within 36 hours.
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service also issued a tropical storm
warning for Florida as the hurricane was moving toward northwest
from the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
Forecasters earlier had predicted that Bertha would stay clear
of the United States but they changed the forecast Tuesday. At 8
a.m. EDT Wednesday, Bertha was about 55 miles east of Eleuthera
Island in the middle of the 700-island Bahamas archipelago, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
There were about 40,000 residents and summer visitors on the
Hatteras Island and about 10,000 people, mostly tourists, were on
Ocracoke Island before the evacuation, emergency management
officials said.

CAIRO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Children's mortality in South Asia

</P>
<P>
The report on the conditions of children worldwide, which was

<HEADLINE> France Says It Follows Situation in Niger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- France said today that it is
following with "a lot of attention" the situation in Niger after
General Ibrahim Bare Mainassara, head of the country's military
junta, dissolved the Independent National Electorate Commission
(CENI).
</P>
<P>
Yves Doutriaux, vice-spokesman of the French Foreign Ministry,
said that "things which happened in the past 48 hours, notably the
dissolution of the CENI (on Monday) during counting of the votes,
have raised questions."
</P>
<P>
He said that "the French government has always hoped that the
voting go on in transparency so that the outcomes would be
incontestable and undisputed."
</P>
<P>
General Ibrahim Bare Mainassara was elected in the first round
of election on Sunday and Monday with 52.22 percent of votes,
according to the National Commission of Elections which has
replaced the CENI.
</P>
<P>
Mainassar has been in power since January after ejecting
President Mahamane Ousmane. Ousmane also ran in the election.
</P>
<P>
The United States Monday criticized the dissolution of CENI,
saying this had jeopardized the credibility of the elections and
would throw a doubt on outcomes of the voting.

<HEADLINE> French Army to Cut 38 Regiments in 3 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The French Army will cut 38
regiments from a total of 180 in the next three years and the Air
Force will close five bases next year, said the French daily Le
Monde today.
</P>
<P>
The French Defense Minister Charles Million is to announce next
Wednesday a package of "measures for adaptation" to reform the
country's defense system as was announced by President Jacques
Chirac earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Le Monde said in its Friday edition that among the regiments to
be cut are the military academy regiments, the instruction school
of armoured ground force and the cavalry at Saumur.
</P>
<P>
The report said that in the 2000-2002 period, the commanding
structures and support systems of the French armed forces will
also put under restructuring programs.
</P>
<P>
The reduction will decrease France's army deployment in Germany
from 20,000 to 3,000, and throw doubts over the future of the
Eurocorps, said Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
The report said that in 1997, the air force will close five of
its 44 bases, including those in Chartres of Eure-et-Loir, Cenon
in Gironde. Toul in Meurthe-et-Moselle, Limoges in Haute-Vienne
and the plateau of Albion in Vaucluse which shelters strategic
nuclear missiles now.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the French Navy will also be reorganized along with
the restructuring of its arsenals, said the report.
</P>
<P>
According to a law on military programing, the country's
defense system will cut 24 percent of its forces. That will bring
about a 35 percent reduction of the ground force, a 24 percent cut
of the air force and a 20 percent cut of the navy.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Unveils Internet Regulation Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore Government
unveiled today a scheme to regulate the Internet, the master
network of the global computer networks, which now has over 40
million subscribers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
In announcing the Class License Scheme for regulating the
Internet at a press conference today, the Singapore Broadcasting
Authority (SBA) reiterated its commitment to "safeguard the
interest of the Internet community while promoting the healthy
development of the industry."
</P>
<P>
The scheme, which takes effect next Monday, aims to encourage
responsible use of the Internet while facilitating its healthy
development in Singapore, the SBA said.
</P>
<P>
"It encourages minimum standards in cyberspace and seeks to
protect Net users, particularly the young, against the broadcast
of unlawful or objectionable materials," it explained.
</P>
<P>
The automatic licensing scheme will cover Internet Service
Providers and Internet Content Providers. Under the conditions of
the license, these providers are obligated to assist the SBA with
any relevant information on persons who violated the rules. It
will focus on groups which provide content pages on an organized
basis.
</P>
<P>
"SBA will focus on content which may undermine public morals,
political stability and religious harmony of Singapore. However,
SBA recognizes that it is impossible to regulate the Internet
fully," the SBA said.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that the success of Internet regulation will depend
very much on industry self-regulation and community action.
"Singaporeans can help SBA in the identification of objectionable
sites in order to keep cyberspace clean," it said.

<HEADLINE> CSA Spokesman Lashes at ABC Doping Accusation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua/OANA) -- A spokesman of the Chinese
Swimming Association (CSA) Thursday lashed at the American
Broadcasting Company (ABC) for its accusation against Chinese
swimmers of systematic doping.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the program, which was shown on
July 10, shortly before the opening of the centennial Olympic
Games, had an ulterior motive.
</P>
<P>
Anti-doping is a tough, complicated and worldwide issue for the
world sports and requires long-term and continuous efforts of all
the international sports federations, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Though the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and
international sports federations had taken serious measures to
cope with the issue, the spokesman said, doping cases were
discovered in many countries, including in those world's sports
powerhouses.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the CSA had been a firm supporter of
the FINA rules and regulations against the use of drugs, and
strictly followed the anti-doping policy of "strict prohibition,
strict testing and severe punishment" set up by the Chinese
Olympic Committee (COC). As to those tested positive, the CSA has
never hesitated in imposing severe punishments on the offenders
and their coaches, and the punishment had been even more severe
than those set up by the international federations.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, the spokesman said, some foreign associations
had failed to take a firm stand against doping issues and even let
their drug offenders take part in Olympic trials. Under such
circumstances, people had to ask why the ABC deliberately
neglected those facts and, instead, broadcast such a program.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the centennial Olympic Games would be a
showpiece of unity of the Olympic family, and the ABC program
broadcast at such a time would harm the healthy atmosphere of the
Games and brutally trample the Olympic Spirit.

<HEADLINE> US Official to Visit Cyprus Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. permanent representative to
the U.N. Madeleine Albright will visit Cyprus to follow up the
discussions on the Cyprus issue between Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides and U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington last month,
a U.S. diplomat said here today.
</P>
<P>
The new U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus, Kenneth Brill, was speaking
after his first meeting with Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides,
soon after presenting his credentials to President Glafcos
Clerides.
</P>
<P>
Brill, who arrived here Tuesday, and Michaelides discussed
Albright's tour of Nicosia, Athens and Ankara between July 16-19,
accompanied by U.S. presidential emissary for Cyprus Richard
Beattie.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on press reports that Albright will be
bringing some ideas on the Cyprus problem, Brill said, "She is
coming here to help advance the process that was discussed in
Washington."
</P>
<P>
He added that she will be "following up those discussions and
see how we can move the process further ahead."
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus News Agency (CNA) today quoted U.S. State Department
spokesman Nicholas Burns as saying that Albright brings with her
some American ideas about the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
She will try to "inject into the Cyprus situation some ideas
to try to resolve the more than 20 years old diplomatic problem,"
Burns told CNA.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Albright's trip as "very significant," Brill
noted that the focus of this trip will be Cyprus but she "has
other responsibilities as well so she will also be discussing
other issues."
</P>
<P>
The new American ambassador reiterated President Clinton's
personal commitment to helping the efforts for solving the
protracted Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, presenting his credentials to President Clerides
today, the new U.S. ambassador assured Cyprus that his country
will continue "to work closely with the United Nations and others,
to help the Cypriot people achieve an acceptable solution to the
Cyprus problem, based on a bizonal, bicommunal federation."
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated the determination of the Clinton
Administration "to help, in any way it can, promote a just and
lasting settlement to the Cyprus problem."

<HEADLINE> Australian Experts Find New Method to Treat AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Australian experts have found a
new method to treat HIV/AIDS affected people by both boosting
their immune system and combating the HIV virus in a successful
clinical trial, a report said today.
</P>
<P>
Sean Emery, senior lecturer in the Faculty of Medicine at the
University of New South Wales, said that it was the largest trial
of the drug IL-2 ever undertaken in anti-HIV medicine, the
Australian Associated Press reported from Brisbane, a port city in
the east coast.
</P>
<P>
The drug belongs to a group called immunomodulators, which
stimulate the immune system, and is still experimental for HIV
treatment.
</P>
<P>
The study of 115 patients in six Australian hospitals showed
that those who received IL-2 as well as antiretroviral therapy --
the current standard prescribed drug treatment -- almost doubled
their T-cell immunity count in 12 months.
</P>
<P>
"Antiretrovirals stop the virus replicating but IL-2 will
preserve or hopefully rebuild what has already been damaged in the
immune system," Emery said.
</P>
<P>
Emery said an important result from the trial was that IL-2,
which can produce severely debilitating side effects, could be
given safely and was not rejected by participants.

ATLANTA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Atlanta cab drivers said Wednesday
that the 4 dollars flat-rate fare increase for the Olympics won't
help much but they will willy-nilly accept it.
</P>
<P>
"This little flat rate isn't going to cover anything," said a
47-year-old cab driver.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Bill Campbell signed legislation just before midnight
Tuesday that enacted the increase, in effect until August 30.
</P>
<P>
The mayor had vetoed a more costly increase passed by the City
Council.
</P>
<P>
The flat rate for one passenger from the airport to the
downtown, for example, went from 18 dollars to 22.
</P>
<P>
The higher fares are hardly enough compensate for big traffic
jams, cabbies say. "It's going to take people longer to go
places," said Nathan Whatley, a superviser for Georgia Cab Co.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Parliament Approves New Election Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's
half-Moslem-half-Christian parliament approved today a new
election bill, paving the way for those desiring a place in the
128-seat house to prepare themselves for running for the election
next month.
</P>
<P>
After three days of hot debates, the Lebanese unicameral
parliament ratified the bill by an overwhelming majority without
introducing a major amendment.
</P>
<P>
The election bill divides the country into four constituencies
tantamount to the governorates of Beirut, the North, the South and
Bekaa, excepting the fifth governorate of Mount Lebanon where
elections will be held on the basis of the six districts it
consists of.
</P>
<P>
Oppositions to the division mainly came from Christians
arguing that it was designed to ensure the election of Walid
Jumblat, leader of the Shouf mountain-based small Druze
community, who is a political ally of Prime Minister Rafik
al-Hariri and an intimate friend of the Syrian leaders.
</P>
<P>
However, the parliament approved the controversial bill despite
prevalent fears that the Lebanese powerful Christian community
would be disencouraged to participate in the election since the
guaranteed election of Jumblat and his friends would reduce
chances of independent Christians who might otherwise be elected
to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Most Christians and some Moslems boycotted the 1992
parliamentary election on the grounds that there could be no just
elections in this country with a presence of foreign forces
(referring to the Syrian military existence) on the lands.
</P>
<P>
In his debate during the parliament's general session, Selim
Hoss, the former prime minister, said that the bill was in breach
of the 1989 Taif accord for national reconciliation which ended
the 1975-90 civil war and which stated that all electoral
districts should be based on Lebanon's five governorates.
</P>
<P>
Before becoming a law, the election bill still needs a
signature of President Elias Hrawi. After the approval in the
parliament, the bill is expected to be immediately handed over to
the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
The election activities are scheduled to begin on August 18 and
will go through the next four weeks. The formal schedule will be
officially announced soon by Interior Minister Michel Al-Murr.
</P>
<P>
Even before a green light given by the government, some
impatient candidates have hung out their pictures in the
capital's streets since a week ago.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Christian mainstream Phalange Party announced
13 candidates to run for election throughout the country. Six
others had been formally declared earlier by the Lebanese
Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
According to the Lebanese constitution, the president must
always be a Maronite Catholic, the house speaker a Moslem Shiite
and the prime minister a Moslem Sunni. And the seats of the
parliament are distributed among the 17 religious or sectarian
communities roughly in accordance with their population
proportions.

Hurricane Bertha skirted the coast of Florida, stubbornly chugging
toward the Carolinas with sustained winds of 105 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinians reacted Wednesday with anger and disappointment

Washington by Israel's new right-wing prime minister, Binyamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:

<HEADLINE> Lockheed-Martin to Hand Over A Satellite to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- American-owned Lockheed-Martin
International is to hand over a telecommunications satellite to a
Chinese company in September next year. It will be launched later
by a Chinese Long March B rocket at the Xichang Satellite Launch
Center.
</P>
<P>
The satellite, "Zhongwei I", is to be made for the China
Orient Telecom Satellite Company, which is an affiliate of the
state Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The satellite is equipped with 48 36-MHZ transmitters, equal to
the total number of satellite transmitters that China has at
present. And the satellite will cover the whole of China, and most
parts of Asia.
</P>
<P>
Thomas J. Dwyer, vice-president for business development at
Lockheed Martin, said that the recent lifting of the ban that US
President Bill Clinton announced on the American companies' export
of telecommunications satellites to China, will make it easier for
the company to expand its business in China.
</P>
<P>
However, Dwyer also confessed that his company is facing strong
competition from European counterparts.
</P>
<P>
China has the most powerful and competent carrier rockets in
the world, and is also the biggest potential market for commercial
satellite launching, Dwyer said, adding that he hoped to expand
his company's business in China.
</P>
<P>
Lockheed-Martin's export of the satellite will be the first
ever commercial satellite-launch cooperation between China and the
U.S., and will benefit both countries, Dwyer said.
</P>
<P>
The satellite to be launched will be able to meet China's
growing demand for more telecommunications satellites, and also
pave the way for China to realize the goal of linking every
Chinese village with the telephone system.

<HEADLINE> Panel Meeting for Celebrating HK's Return Held in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- A panel set up to arrange
celebrations to mark Hong Kong's return to China next year ended
its third meeting in Beijing today. The panel, established under
the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR), met for two days in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong members of the Preparatory Committee gave an account
of the preparations for the establishment of a committee for
celebrating Hong Kong's return to the motherland by all walks of
life in Hong Kong, and plans for celebrations submitted by all
circles of the Hong Kong society.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee members held that the work of the
panel should be given an appropriate readjustment according to the
present-day actual situation, and a decision made at a directors
meeting of the Preparatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
The main task of the panel is to support and coordinate
non-governmental celebrations to be held in Hong Kong, as well as
relevant matters.
</P>
<P>
The committee for celebrating Hong Kong's return, which was
sponsored by the Hong Kong members of the Celebrating Activities
Panel according to the arrangement of the Preparatory Committee,
is a non-governmental organization composed of local Hong Kong
people.
</P>
<P>
It will be responsible for organizing and coordinating the
non-governmental and mass celebrations in the whole of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR held
that the preparatory commission for the Celebration Activities
Committee has achieved a great deal.
</P>
<P>
They gave support to the four activities proposed by the
commission: a large-scale performance on the '97 return of Hong
Kong to the motherland, beginning on the evening of June 30, 1997;
a decorative vehicle parade to be held on July 1 and 2; a firework
display; and a cultural evening, as well as relevant plans for
celebration activities submitted by all circles of Hong Kong
society.
</P>
<P>
They expressed the hope that the committee for celebrating Hong
Kong's return should pay attention to coordinating the
corresponding celebrations to be sponsored by the government of
the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee members predicted that in holding
celebrations for Hong Kong's return, the regional flag and
regional emblem of the Hong Kong SAR would be used widely.
</P>
<P>
In order to meet the needs of every activity and satisfy the
demands of Hong Kong people from all walks of life, the members of
the Preparatory Committee of Hong Kong SAR suggested that before
enacting laws by the Hong Kong SAR, the Preparatory Committee
should first issue a document to give guidance on how to use the
regional flag and regional emblem.

<P>
ATLANTA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Soldiers, police and hidden
cameras have been employed to monitor reservoirs, water towers and
underground storage tanks to ensure that no one tampers with metro
Atlanta's water supply during the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Fences with barbed wire have also been constructed around water
treatment areas and intake facilities that bring water from the
Chattahoochee River and other rivers and streams into the drinking
water system.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Atlanta area water authorities are
disclosing very litte about the high-tech security measures being
taken to deter terroists and pranksters.
</P>
<P>
Water authorities apparently have two worries: threats to water
purity, and threats to the delivery of the water itself. Hot
weather and drought already have many of metro Atlanta's 15
systems operating at the edge of capacity.
</P>
<P>
"We are removing our ladders from tanks and bolting down any
trapdoors," said Marcellus Pitts, a manager of water
infrastructure here. "We have to be proactive or somebody could
drop something in the water."
</P>
<P>
The city of Atlanta is taking the most drastic measures. A
security force of 53 soldiers and police will patrol the
facilities 24 hours a day. The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will be
conducting toxicity tests around the clock.

decided to go on with administration cooperation.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the European Commission (EC), the executive arm

"This is a first step in setting up a mechanism for promoting
cooperation between the two organizations," he noted, adding that
the two sides have a strong willingness to improve and enlarge
their relations.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC is a regional body founded in 1985 which groups
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri
Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Political dialogue between the EU and SAARC was officially
opened in September 1994, when the foreign ministers of the

<HEADLINE> King Hussein Supports Government's Efforts to Lift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan expressed
here today his full support for the government's efforts to lift
subsidies on bread.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here today by Prime Minister Abdul
Karim Kabariti on floating the price of bread, King Hussein
praised the prime minister's courage to take the bold move.
</P>
<P>
In the midst of the press conference, King Hussein appeared
suddenly and attended part of it.
</P>
<P>
His presence was seen as a strong support to the government
and his great attention to the thorny issue.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for all citizens to make sacrifice in
order to achieve self-reliance and strongly accused the
opposition parties of harming national interests by opposing the
government's move.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to go on building the homeland, every citizen should
reconsider his views, believes and stands and should put them on
the right track, said King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
He recalled the situation in 1989, when riots occurred in
several Jordanian cities after the government had imposed price
rises of between 15 percent and 50 percent on basic goods and
services.
</P>
<P>
He warned against the resurgence of the grave situation.
</P>
<P>
The king said Jordan was the first country in the world to
shoulder its responsibilities when it received waves of
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
He added the country has centered on education, health,
communications and other important fields to give the Jordanian
citizens a chance to be more productive.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kabariti said the government will fix all the
issues relating to the price increase of bread and announce the
decision "in a couple of days."
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that the move will not be implemented
until after setting all necessary mechanism and arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti reiterated that the Jordanian citizens will be
compensated for the increase in the price of bread.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that he believed people will support the
government's move once the "misunderstanding and
misinterpretation" were solved.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Information Minister Marwan Muasher Wednesday
announced the government's detailed plans to lift subsidies on
bread, saying that the price hike will not affect citizens'
standard of life.

<HEADLINE> Iran Faces Population Explosion (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian authorities today
sounded the alarm for a danger of population explosion as 25
million youngsters under 17 are approaching the age of marriage.
</P>
<P>
Ali Reza Marandi, Minister of Health and Medical Care, said
"We will have another phase of high population growth in the
future and we are very much concerned about the situation."
</P>
<P>
"There are a large number of children under 16 or 17 and they
are reaching gradually the age of marriage. In other words, 25
million youngsters mean 12.5 million couples in the future. If
each couple have two children, still they will add 25 million to
the population," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is my concern. But we are doing our best to educate our
people through mass media in order to decrease the growth rate,"
said the minister in an exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Today is the World Population Day. Some 1,000 people,
specialists and government officials gathered here to explore ways
of birth control in the Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
The past 20 years witnessed a fast growth of population which
has been doubled from 34 million in 1976 to 64 million in
Iran. However, the oil export income decreased twice for the
country. The population growth has posed a grave threat to the
development of the national economy and other social development.
</P>
<P>
Specialists warned that the population would be doubled again
in 20 or 25 years, thus naturally aggravating the conditions and
pressure upon the decision-makers.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Vice-President Hamid Mirzadeh said at today's seminar
"our large population is consuming 75 percent of our resources
while only 20-25 percent goes to long-term development."
</P>
<P>
Xu Shuyun, representative of the United Nations Population Fund
in Tehran, said at the meeting that the United Nations supports
Iran's population and family planning program. "UNFPA will
continue, as in the past, its fruitful cooperation with Iran's
relevant ministries and organizations in order to achieve our
common goals in the field of population and development."
</P>
<P>
Mohaqiq Damad, a leading clergyman and head of Iran's General
Accounting Office, said, "The population growth rate is not a
religious issue in Iran," arguing that the notion that Islam
encourages population growth is an utter misconception and a "pure
lie."
</P>
<P>
Actually, the family planning was a taboo in the Islamic
Republic about eight years ago. Some doctors were even executed
for carrying out abortion operations for women.

<HEADLINE> Iran Faces Population Explosion (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some political analysts noted that it is too late for the
Islamic regime to realize the importance of birth control across
the country, because the population is now too large to control.
</P>
<P>
The problem of the swelling population has seriously affected
the society in various fields ranging from economy, employment,
education to welfare and medical care.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Marandi told Xinhua, "We are developing country
and we should be able to develop our country faster than the
developed countries. We need to have population under control."
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran used to have a very high population growth
rate of 3.9 percent. It started family planning in 1989. "We have
been able to bring the growth rate from 3.9 percent to 1.56
percent in the past six or seven years."
</P>
<P>
Judging from the past success, the Iranian minister was
optimistic about the family planning policy in his country,
saying that he had some doubts about the doubling of the
population in the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
He argued, "If things go well it should not double before 40
years. We are gradually improving our situation."
</P>
<P>
Marandi said that the Iranian government will continue to
implement the family policy. "Our hope is that people would
decide on two children."
</P>
<P>
However, he added, "We have not restricted below the line. We
even allow three children for each family."
</P>
<P>
"If a family has more than three children, they will lose some
of their benefits such as subsidy on their health insurance, and
subsidies that they are getting for other things would be taken
away from them," he said.
</P>
<P>
So, he continued, three children is still acceptable. "But we
are hoping that they would have two."
</P>
<P>
"If they would prefer one for each family, we would like that
also. And if they would decide not to have any children at all, we
don't mind that either. We are after a lower population growth for
the entire country," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Keep Prices Stable: People's Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- In a commentary to be published
tomorrow, the People's Daily is calling for redoubled efforts be
made to stabilize prices and tighten supervision over and
management of market prices.
</P>
<P>
The paper, the leading newspaper in China, says in the
commentary: "China scored marked successes in curbing
inflation in the first half of this year."
</P>
<P>
Urban and rural markets are now prosperous and stable, and the
price increase range has continued to fall, it adds.
</P>
<P>
The country's general commodity retail price index rose 7.1
percent during the January-June period from the same period a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
Except for a few provinces, the range of the increase in
commodity retail prices has fallen within the range of ten percent.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said the success in curbing inflation is due
primary to the improvement of the macro-economic environment, and
the near balance between total supply and total demand.
</P>
<P>
"Another factor is the implementation of various measures to
strengthen the farming sector, a good summer grain harvest, and
sufficient supplies of grain, cotton, edible oil, meat and other
major farm and sideline products," it says.
</P>
<P>
It asks governments at all levels to do their utmost to combat
natural disasters, make a success of the restructuring of
state-owned enterprises, and halt the decrease in the economic
returns of enterprises.
</P>
<P>
It also stresses the importance of continuing to implement the
relatively tight monetary policy, and retain a near balance between
total supply and total demand.

<HEADLINE> E-Mail Roommates In Court Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- China's first case of suspected
E-mail abuse has been heard by the Haidian District People's Court
of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The case, the first of its kind in China, was launched after a
Chinese student missed a chance-in-a-lifetime opportunity to study
in the USA.
</P>
<P>
Michigan University, which had offered an 18,000 US dollar
scholarship to Xue Yange, gave the place to somebody else after
receiving an e-mail message on the world Internet.
</P>
<P>
The allegation is that Xue's roommate, Zhang Nan, sent the
e-mail declining the university place.
</P>
<P>
The two young women are classmates in the Psychology Department
of the famous Beijing University. Both of them are due to graduate
this summer with master's degrees.
</P>
<P>
In early April Xue received an e-mail message from Michigan
University, telling her she had been granted a scholarship of
18,000 U.S. dollars for further training.
</P>
<P>
While waiting for a formal notice, Xue was told April 27 that
an e-mail in her name had been sent to the American university,
informing them that she had chosen other university, and declining
the scholarship. Michigan University then decided to consider
other candidates for the scholarship.
</P>
<P>
Xue said that Michigan University was the only American
university that had promised to give her scholarship.
</P>
<P>
She suspected Zhang of writing the electronic-letter, and filed
a case which was accepted for hearing by the Haidian District
People's Court. She cited violation of her name.
</P>
<P>
Zhang admitted that she did send three e-mails from the
university laboratory on April 12. One of them was sent to a
friend in the United States, four minutes before the e-mail to
Michigan University was sent out. But Zhang denied that the
message to the university was written or sent by her.
</P>
<P>
Xue and Zhang shared the same e-mail address, which belonged to
Zhang's tutor.
</P>
<P>
Zhang told the court that six or seven American universities
had informed her that they would grant her scholarships. She chose
one and refused the rest.
</P>
<P>
Zhang read one of the letters to the court, to show that there
was no similarity in the grammar of her letter, and the one sent
to Michigan University. Xue had claimed that the grammar of the
letter to Michigan University accorded with the grammatical style
of Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The plaintiff is also claiming 15,000 yuan (about 1,807
U.S. dollars) in compensation for spiritual loss and suffering.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that she will file a cross-charge against the
plaintiff for defaming her reputation by making the allegations.
</P>
<P>
The court decided after debate to postpone the announcement
of the verdict.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese learned about the Internet in December 1993 when
Zhu Ling, a student from Beijing-based Qinghua University, was
found seriously poisoned by a mystery substance. While Zhu was in
hospital some of her classmates went to the Internet for help. The
information received from various parts of the world provided help
to enable medics to make an accurate diagnosis, and then
administer life-saving treatment.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- HIV/AIDS and reproductive health
were the themes of an education campaign held in Beijing to mark
World Population Day today.
</P>
<P>
The event was sponsored by the State Family Planning Committee
and other family planning organizations.
</P>
<P>
State Councillor Peng Peiyun said that the Chinese government
attaches great importance to the health care of mothers and
babies, and that a healthcare law for mothers and infants was
launched in 1994 to strengthen services for reproductive health.
</P>
<P>
Peng said that since the International Conference on Population
and Development and the 4th International Conference on Women,
China has taken various measures to improve reproductive health
services, which are conducive to the family planning policy.
</P>
<P>
She said that the infection rate of the HIV/AIDS virus is still
low in China, but HIV/AIDS cases are increasing in the country.
</P>
<P>
People can be infected by the HIV/AIDS virus through blood
transfusion or sexual intercourse -- the leading causes of the
disease in China, Peng said. An HIV-infected mother can pass the
disease on to her baby, she said.
</P>
<P>
She urged that the illegal collection of blood for clinical use
must be prohibited, that a blood donation system be established,
and that prostitution, drug abuse and drug trafficking be banned.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Nafis Sadik, Executive Director of the United Nations
Population Fund, said that the AIDS pandemic poses a severe threat
to the world community: every minute, about five people contract
the HIV virus which eventually leads to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Women are biologically and socially more vulnerable to HIV than
men, she said, and empowering women and educating both sexes about
HIV/AIDS prevention provide the intervention needed to reduce
women's risk for infection.
</P>
<P>
About 21.8 million people in the world have HIV/AIDS, and 5.5
million AIDS patients have died since the discovery of the disease
in 1981, according to a report released by the World Health
Organization.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sadik called on the people all over the world to take the
responsibility for preventing and controlling HIV/AIDS.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine defense sector got
the biggest share in the proposed 476.2 billion peso (18.3 billion
US dollar) 1997 national budget.
</P>
<P>
According to local media reports, the defense allocation for
1997 was placed at 37.2 billion pesos (1.4 billion US dollars)
from 30.9 billion pesos (1.2 billion US dollars) in 1996, a growth
of 20.4 percent which is even higher than the percentage growth of
the allocation for social services.
</P>
<P>
In a recent memorandum to President Fidel Ramos, Budget and
Management Secretary Salvador Enriquez, jr. said the increase in
the defense budget resulted from the "substantial increases in
personal services arising from salary adjustments for defense
personnel."
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the defense sector accounted for 7.2 percent of the
total budget, and in the 1997 budget proposal, the defense slice
will grow to 7.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> WWII Japanese-style Caps Confiscated in Xiamen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Caps modeled on Japanese soldiers'
headgear during World War II have been confiscated from markets in
Xiamen, southeast China's port city, and wearing of them is
banned, according to the "Yangcheng Evening News".
</P>
<P>
The city government had confiscated 28,751 of the caps sold in
street stalls and shops by the end of June. Some residents have
handed over caps they bought, voluntarily, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
The army caps have been available throughout the city, since
early summer. Many of those seen wearing the caps, mainly
youngsters, said they just did it without thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
The caps aroused the strong resentment of local officials and
residents, many of whom said they thought they were an insult to
the nation's feelings.
</P>
<P>
"We should never lose national self-esteem and integrity no
matter how times changes," a citizen told the newspaper,
explaining his feelings.
</P>
<P>
Like other parts of China, Xiamen was invaded by Japanese
troops during WW II. Some 35 million Chinese were killed or
wounded during the eight-year war of resistance against Japan
(1937-1945), according to an official document of the late 1940s.
</P>
<P>
The paper did not say whether the cap producer, Yongguan Cap
Company of Xiamen, has been warned, but it said that city
officials have ordered departments to "strictly investigate the
matter".
</P>
<P>
In north China's Tianjin City, the Japanese Tianjin Koei
Company has been closed because it produced a computer game
featuring battles between Japan and Allied troops during WWII,
according to a "China Daily" report today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese officials in charge of investigation said that the
Japanese firm, whose software contained images of war-era planes,
ships, and war criminal Hideki Tojo, violates China's Provision on
Electronics Publication.

<P>
FREETOWN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Defense officials in the east of
Sierra Leone today reported increased "rebel harassment of
civilians and commercial vehicles" traveling along the highway
linking Kenema and Kailahun districts.
</P>
<P>
A senior military officer in Kenema confirmed in a telephone
interview that five commercial vehicles were "ransacked" by
rebels within the past four days.
</P>
<P>
Media reports from the area said passengers were "stripped
naked and told to go home without their belongings."
</P>
<P>
According to one Lebanese businessman whose goods were among
those looted, a total of 80 bags of rice, 15 bags of onions,10
boxes of tomatoes were looted.
</P>
<P>
The four incidents have "created a great fear in the business
community in the area," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to one journalist, Ndonbah Junction between Hangha
village and Mano Junction is the main point of rebel attacks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Information Minister Goerge Banda Thomas speaking
at a press conference late Wednesday denied media accusations
that the South African mercenary group, Executive Outcomes was
involved in diamond mining in Kono, in the east of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Outcomes has a security contract with the Sierra
Leone government and is fighting alongside government troops in
the rebel war.
</P>
<P>
"It is the responsibility of the government to protect the
state and it was the EO that helped ward off the rebels when they
were within range of the capital last year," Banda Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
Director of Mines Andrew Belewa also denied issuing any
license to the EO to mine diamonds, he said about two members of
the EO have resigned their jobs with the group, left the country
and have come back with a number of investors but the government
has not yet given clearance to them to undertake mining.

<P>
LONDON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Football Association of Wales
(FAW) Thursday said that they were hoping to talk to their English
counterparts about the possibility of playing a role in the bid
for the 2006 World Cup, according to reports from Cardiff.
</P>
<P>
FAW president Brian Fear said: "Wales could never hope to stage
a World Cup on our own, we just haven't got the grounds. But we
would love to be involved in one and I'm sure the Scots would
too."
</P>
<P>
"With Japan and Korea staging the 2002 World Cup jointly it
has set a precedent and I would have thought it would be a great
idea to get the whole of the United Kingdom involved," Fear
added.
</P>
<P>
The English launched their bid after the highly succesful Euro
96 competition in June and received immediate support from the
government.
</P>
<P>
However, the government's Heritage Department has also granted
46 million pounds (71.48 million U.S. dollars) towards the
modernisation of the National Stadium in Cardiff.
</P>
<P>
A Heritage Department spokesman said: "We wouldn't want to
pre-empt the F.A. on how they formulate their bid, but we would
acknowledge that there are top quality facilities in all parts
of the UK and believe it would be possible to put together a
four-country bid."

<HEADLINE> New Head of Sydney Olympian Organiser Appointed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 11 (Xinhua/OANA) -- The Sydney Organising
Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) appointed its new chief
operating officer today.
</P>
<P>
SOCOG Chief Executive Mal Hemmerling announced in Sydney today
that Gerry Moriarty, a top-ranking telecommunications executive,
would be SOCOG's second in command.
</P>
<P>
The position of chief operating officer in SOCOG was newly
created. Moriarty will be the first person assuming the position
in September.
</P>
<P>
He will be responsible for logistical services, technology,
games services and facilities.
</P>
<P>
Moriarty is presently the chief executive officer of Telstra
Multimedia under the government-owned telecommunications company
Telstra.
</P>
<P>
He joined Telstra in July 1993 as managing director of Network
Products before being appointed chief executive officer of Telstra
Multimedia in 1995.
</P>
<P>
He spent 26 years in the radio, television and
telecommunications industries. Before he joined Telstra, he used
to worked with the Broadcasting Corporation of New Zealand and the
Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) Television New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Hemmerling said that Moriarty was selected from a "strong field
of applicants."
</P>
<P>
"We are delighted that Telstra agreed to release someone of
the calibre of Mr Moriarty for the term of the project (September
1996-2001)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Former SOCOG President Gary Pemberton resigned from the
position because of business reasons in March.
</P>
<P>
John Iliffe, Chairman of the retail giant Woolworths, succeeded
Pemberton as the President.
</P>
<P>
Since SOCOG was established on November 12, 1993, six of the 13
members of its board have been replaced. Among those who quitted
is Kerry Packer, the richest man in Australia.
</P>
<P>
One of the major issues faced by SOCOG is the budget
blowout. In the latest development, the Australian Olympic
Committee (AOC) announced Wednesday that its agreement with the
New South Wales state government on the distribution of the Games
revenue was in jeopardy temporarily. The two parties disagreed on
several clauses of the final version of the agreement, which have
to be handed to the International Olympic Committee on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> High Tuition Collecting on Pretext of Having Foreign Experts Banned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- China will forbid schools and
other educational organizations from collecting high tuitions on
the pretext of having foreign experts or teachers, sources in
Beijing said here today.
</P>
<P>
China has employed an increasing number of foreign experts
since 1979, when the reform and opening-up was initiated. In 1995,
more than 14,000 foreigners from 54 countries worked in the
country's cultural and educational sectors.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, more than 600 units in the cultural
fields hired foreign experts; 96 percent of them were public
institutions of higher learning.
</P>
<P>
Xu Zhenyuan, deputy director of the State Bureau of Foreign
Experts Affairs (SBFEA), said here today that the foreigners have
contributed much to the development of China's culture, education,
technology and economic construction.
</P>
<P>
However, the lack of standard employment regulations has
produced disorder in some places that hire foreign professionals,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The SBFEA and the State Education Commission have jointly
published a regulation governing the hiring of foreign experts by
schools and universities.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulation, they are forbidden to seek
excessive profits by asking for high tuition fees because they
employ foreign experts.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, schools and universities must be certified by the
SBFEA before they can engage foreign experts. Those responsible
for illegal hiring practices will be punished by the public
security department, in accordance to the relevant regulations.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dream Team Downs Chinese Olympians by 61 Points </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHOENIX, July 10 (Xinhua/OANA) -- The U.S. Dream Team proved
that it is getting better and better since their gathering a
couple of weeks ago as the Olympic favorite trounced the Chinese
Team 119-58 in a warm-up game here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dunkings, steals and fast breaks, the Dream Team showed a real
NBA basketball before a crowd of 20,000-seat fans at American West
Arena, with Reggie Miller leading the hosts with 16 points.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team, which got a narrow win over the American
under-22 Selected Team by only six points and big victory over
Brazil by 41 points last sunday, never trailed during the game
after Charles Barkley, who just became free agent from the Phoenix
Suns, scored the first points on his two free throws and first six
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
"We won the game thanks to our good and aggressive defense,
which made things happen," said Lenny Wilkens, coach of the Dream
Team.
</P>
<P>
The Americans built a 13-3 lead only less two minutes into the
game and scored 62 points in the first half, enough for winning
the exhibition, while China got 38 points.
</P>
<P>
The second half was more worse for the visitors, who will play
the Dream Team in the group A during the Olympic Games opening on
July 19, when the U.S. counterparts played almost without
challenge by 13 of 22 slam dunkings and 10 of 21 steals.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect we could lost more than 60 points. I thought
40 or 50 was possible," the Chinese Team coach Gong Luming said.
</P>
<P>
"We played well in the first half, compared to the second half
where We were under our normal level," he added.
</P>
<P>
China scored all eight three-pointers in the first half with
two each by Zheng Wu and Hu Weidong.
</P>
<P>
"Too many turnovers and poor reboundings were the main reason
to be beaten by such a big margin. They played very good fast
break which made us more difficult to match up," the Chinese Team
captain Wu Qinglong said.
</P>
<P>
China committed 27 tourovers, 16 in the first half, and was
outrebouned by the Dream Team 20-42.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't care what points we should win over China before the
game," Shaquille O'neal said, "We just scored and played the game,
do our best."
</P>
<P>
Grant Hill scored 14 points for the Dream Team, and Scottie
Pippen added 12 and Charles Barkley 11.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhizhi, 19-year-old center, led the Chinese Team with 12
points from his 23 minutes play. He was followed by Zheng Wu with
10 and Hu Weidong eight.
</P>
<P>
The Dream Team will play against Australia in Salt Lake City on
Friday, the fourth of its five warm-up games for the Olympics
which opens July 19.

<HEADLINE> Five Millions Books Ready to Reach Children in Poor Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Five million books were printed
and its first batch sent today from Beijing to children in China's
relatively poverty-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Donated by the Hope Project, the books are are part of an
effort to help poor children make productive use of their summer
vacation, which in China begins in mid-July and lasts about six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Hope Project, which helps young dropouts return
to school, established storage "stack rooms" for books designated
for poor children. More than 150 publishing houses across the
country recommended over 2,500 books for selection by stack room
editors.
</P>
<P>
Publishing houses also turned over the books' copyrights to the
Hope Project, and over 700 writers whose works had been selected
by the stack room editors also donated their copyrights.
</P>
<P>
"Bing Xin" Stack Room, named for a well-known Chinese
children's writer, was donated to Laiyuan Hope Primary School in
north China's Hebei Province, the first beneficiary of the Hope
Project.
</P>
<P>
The Hope Project, sponsored by the Communist Youth League of
China (CYLC), was initiated in 1989, and had collected donations
worth nearly 700 million yuan by the end of last year. The project
has funded the establishment of 2,074 Hope primary schools and
enabled more than 1.25 million dropouts to return to the
classroom.

<HEADLINE> More Women from Rural Areas Form Families in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Many marriages between rural
women and men from urban Shanghai are doomed to failure, experts
in China have warned.
</P>
<P>
The women laborers flocking to China's biggest city have
becomes wives of Shanghai men, but sociologists said the situation
has potential problems.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that in districts linking urban areas
and the city's outskirts, over ten percent of the marriages have
been formed between urban male residents and female laborers from
outside Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
In Luwan District, 988 couples registered their marriage during
the first five months of the year, and 188 couples, about 19
percent of the total, were formed by husbands from Shanghai and
wives from other places.
</P>
<P>
Government officials in the district said such marriages
appeared in the early 1990s, and the number soared around 1994,
when the municipality quickened its urban construction.
</P>
<P>
The females, most of whom came from rural areas in Anhui,
Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, ventured to the China metropolis
to find work as housemaids or factory workers.
</P>
<P>
Their long stay in the city gave a life style resembling that
of urban women, and many even speak fluent Shanghai dialect.
</P>
<P>
Their husbands had found it hard to find wives in the city
because of poor family backgrounds, poor schooling, disease or
physical defects. But the hard-working rural women show much
respect for the old -- answering the marriage dreams of many
men 'left on the shelf'.
</P>
<P>
The rural women appear to have been accepted and cared by many
urban residents. Some districts even opened classes to help
improve their work prospects.
</P>
<P>
However, sociologists think that many of these marriages will
face a series of social problems.
</P>
<P>
Some rural women married in a rush in order to seek a home and
shelter in a city foreign to them. As a result, their marriages
lack solid bases, and many may end in divorce in the future.
</P>
<P>
It is a conventional practice in China that the residences of
children follow their mothers, but the disparity between urban and
rural life remains large.
</P>
<P>
Government sources said that the children of such marriages are
very young, but they will still face difficulties when the are old
enough to attend nurseries or schools.

<HEADLINE> Former Israeli Minister Accuses Netanyahu of Adopting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Former Israeli Minister of Science
and Education Sholamit Aloni has condemned what she called
arrogant colonial policies adopted by Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with Egypt's English-language
newspaper Al-Ahram Weekly, Aloni warned that the colonial policies
are a threat to the existence of the state of Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Israel is the only country left in the world that insists on
remaining a colonial state -- one that has usurped the land and
rights of another people and continues to subject them to
oppression, " said Aloni, who was also the former leader of the
Meretz Party.
</P>
<P>
In the interview carried by the paper published today, she said
the colonial policies must end, otherwise Netanyahu will isolate
Israel once again within the international community and alienate
it from the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Aloni has pressed upon Netanyahu with a need for Israel to
return the Golan Heights to Syria.
</P>
<P>
"The quicker we give the Golan Heights back to Syria, the
sooner our political and moral losses in Israel will be
alleviated," said the minister in the former Israeli government
led by Shimon Peres, Netanyahu's predecessor.
</P>
<P>
"Netanyahu has to choose between his arrogance and building
healthy relations with the Arabs -- and the first step toward this
is to restore their usurped rights to them," she said.
</P>
<P>
She urged U.S. President Bill Clinton to use strong persuasive
measures on Netanyahu and encourage him to continue the peace
process on the basis of the "land-for-peace" formula.
</P>
<P>
"The only remaining hope is that world powers will bring
pressure to bear on Netanyahu and that he will feel the sting of
economic pressures," she said.

<HEADLINE> South Koreans Demand Compensation From U.S. Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Villagers living near a
U.S. military base in South Korea plan to file a suit against the
state demanding compensation for the damage they have sustained
from the noise coming from the firing range of the base.
</P>
<P>
Involved in the move are about 3,500 people from 730 households
located near the firing range of the 7th United States Air Force
in Hwasong County of Kyonggi province.
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for demanding 12,500 dollars per person in
compensation for a total of 43.8 million dollars for mental and
physical damage they claim have sustained from the noise caused by
bombing and shooting exercises at the firing range since it was
established in 1968.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first time for villagers to ask for
compensation from the state in connection with the "military
noise" in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
"In the initial stage, we plan to file a 1.25
million-U.S.-dollar compensation suit before the end of this month
and another suit asking for the rest of the expected compensation
will be filed later after we evaluate developments," said Chon
Man-kyu, chairman of the committee pushing for compensation.
</P>
<P>
The villagers also plan to submit a petition to the National
Assembly urging compensation for the noise damage and seek the
formation of a consultative body on the matter with the Defense
Ministry, American forces and villagers represented.
</P>
<P>
Some 37,000 American troops are currently stationed in South
Korea.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Lift Subsidies on Bread </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has disclosed a detailed plan
to lift subsidies on bread on grounds that that the price hike
will not affect citizens' standard of living.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Information Marwan Muasher said citizens will
receive annual payments to offset the increase in the price of
bread, according to today's English-language daily Jordan
Times.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will put a mechanism to distribute
subsidies to citizens, who will be divided into three categories.
</P>
<P>
The first group includes Jordanians with National Aid Fund
coupons, whose number totals 200 to 250 persons. This group
will be given bread for free, he said.
</P>
<P>
The second group comprises Jordanians working in public and
army sectors, who have Ministry of Supply coupons and who will
be given 15 dinars (21 U.S. dollars) annually to help them buy
bread at the expected new price of 250 fils (35 U.S. cents)
per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
The third group, which includes Jordanians with high
income who are not entitled to Ministry of Supply coupons,
will also be re-funded for the extra cost they pay for
bread.
</P>
<P>
"Every Jordanian will receive 25.26 dinars (about 35
dollars) every year to offset differences between the current
and new prices of bread to ensure that none will be affected," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
"By providing the annual subsidy to Jordanians, the government
will be paying a total of 64 million dinars (about 89.6
million dollars) from the treasury," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the move will save the country 53 million dollars
annually.
</P>
<P>
Recent press reports said that the government has been
subsidizing bread by 112 million dollars; fodder by 112 million
dollars; sugar, powdered milk and rice by 56 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the government is expected to
announce the decision of lifting subsidies on bread soon,
despite severe criticism from the opposition parties and the
public who had threatened to overthrow the government if the
subsidies are lifted.
</P>
<P>
Lifting of the subsidies on bread is the most important step
in the reform program the government launched in 1991 with the
cooperation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
It is also a major step the government has yet to take
so as to reduce the government's budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
The minister told reporters that maintaining subsidy will mean
a budget deficit which the IMF has warned the Kingdom of
developing.
</P>
<P>
The last price increase of bread in 1989 under the request
of the IMF triggered riots throughout the country.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand Faces Trade Deficit with NAFTA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Thailand faces a trade deficit
with the three North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
countries for the first time this year.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months this year, Thailand recorded a trade
deficit totaling 5.75 billion baht (230 million US dollars) with
the NAFTA countries, which are the US, Canada and Mexico, a
Business Economics Department source said today.
</P>
<P>
Of the total loss, 4.277 billion baht (171.1 million dollars),
or 74.4 percent, went to the US, 17.1 percent to Canada, and 8.5
percent to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The source said Thailand is likely to face a trade deficit with
the three countries for the first time this year since NAFTA came
into being in 1992.
</P>
<P>
In the said four months, two-way trade between Thailand and the
three countries grew 11.5 percent, with Thai exports increasing
only 1 percent and imports growing 23.6 percent over the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
The United States represents the biggest market for Thailand
with a 93.4 percent share among the NAFTA countries. The Canadian
market share was 5.4 percent, while the Mexican share was 1.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Thai share in the US market dropped to 1.53
percent from the 1.55 percent recorded in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The source attributed this year's loss to four main factors --
declining Thai domestic input, especially in frozen shrimp
production, fierce competition in markets for jewelry and shoes,
a lack of raw materials such as those needed for the canned
seafood category, and the protectionist measures against canned
tuna and frozen shrimp.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months this year, a sharp drop in export
value was registered for jewelry, frozen shrimp, shoes, rubber,
radios, television sets and parts, canned fruit, video players,
raw coffee and stereos and parts.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President: No Worry over US Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani said here today that Iran should not have the
slightest worry over the U.S. sanctions on the country because
these sanctions will prove to be a total failure.
</P>
<P>
The 61-year-old president declared that Iran is not in need
of the United States and is not dependent on America.
Therefore, the nation need not to be concerned with the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani made the statement while addressing telecommunications
ministers and representatives from 40 member states of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) at the inaugural
ceremony of a major center for long distance and international
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The United States imposed economic sanctions on the Islamic
Republic since June 1995, banning all U.S. companies from trading
and investing in Iran, particularly in oil and gas sector.
</P>
<P>
Now, Washington is going to impose secondary sanctions against
any foreign companies investing 40 million U.S. dollars or more
in Iranian oil and gas industries in a single year.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian authorities criticized the United States for
violation of free trade under the framework of the international
laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani stressed that the appropriate road to attain power
and independence should be taken through construction and Iran
has gone through a major part of this path.

<HEADLINE> Telecom Business Deregulation Called For </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The head of Japan's Economic
Planning Agency (EPA) has called for implementing a drastic
deregulation of the nation's telecommunications industry where
would-be entrants are currently placed under severe official
curbs, Kyodo News Service reported.
</P>
<P>
Japan should allow a greater number of other (telecom business)
carriers to enter or get out of the telecommunications sector,
said Shusei Tanaka, the agency's director general, at a breakfast
meeting with the leaders of the Federation of Economic
Organizations (Keidanren).
</P>
<P>
Tanaka said deregulation should be given priority as it would
lead to helping secure a self-sustained recovery of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Keidanren Chairman Shoichiro Toyoda agreed with Tanaka on the
need to avoid giving further strains to the nation's already
overburdened finances.

<HEADLINE> China's Nuclear Power Output Increases Nearly Half in Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- China's nuclear power plants
generated a total of 5.58 billion kilowatt hours in the first half
of this year, up 47 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures released by the China National Nuclear
Corporation (CNNC) indicate that from January to June, the Daya
Bay Nuclear Power Plant, near Hong Kong, generated a combined
output of about 4.68 billion kilowatt hours, soaring 64 percent.
</P>
<P>
About 59 percent of Daya Bay plant's power output was exported
to Hong Kong in this period, CNNC officials said.
</P>
<P>
Another functioning nuclear power plant, Qinshan, in east
China's Zhejiang Province, generated an output of 909 million
kilowatt hours, down four percent. Officials attributed the slight
decrease to the refueling and maintenance of equipment in the
plant during the period. But in June, the plant produced 220
million kilowatt hours, surpassing its average monthly output.
</P>
<P>
At present, China's nuclear power installed capacity amounts to
2.1 million kilowatts, less than one percent of the country's
total.
</P>
<P>
China plans to build a new nuclear power plant with eight
generating units in the Ninth Five-Year Plan Period (1996-2000) to
ease the shortage of power in the country, especially in the
coastal area.

<HEADLINE> Iran: Egypt Puts Pre-condition on Resuming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati has said that Cairo has put pre-conditions for
normalization of ties with Tehran, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Velayati's statement was carried on the front page of the
English-language daily Iran News. However, the report gave no
details about the pre-conditions for resumption of the diplomatic
relations between the two countries, which was broken after the
signing of the Camp David Accord in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government has expressed regret over the statement
by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who rejected Syrian mediation
between Tehran and Cairo, on grounds that Tehran is still trying
to undermine the Egyptian government.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Mohammadi, spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry,
claimed that "Iran will only resume diplomatic ties with Egypt if
it distances itself from the Zionist regime."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spokesman termed the Egyptian official approach on
the Syrian diplomacy as a "regrettable effort," which is aimed at
crippling the Syrian trouble-shooting shuttle diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
Appreciating the Syrian efforts, he said that Iran has always
been on the Syria's side from the very onset after the Islamic
revolution and will continue to stand by the people and
government of Syria, particularly in their quest to liberate
their occupied lands.

<HEADLINE> Lake's China Visit Makes Positive, Useful Contribution: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- China said here today that the
recent visit of Anthony Lake, assistant to the US president for
national security affairs, has made "a positive and useful
contribution to the further improvement and development of Sino-US
relations."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Cui Tiankai told a weekly press
conference that the visit "has served to enhance the mutual trust
and understanding between China and the US and improved the
climate of bilateral relations."
</P>
<P>
Cui made the remarks when asked to comment on the outcome of
Lake's visit.
</P>
<P>
On the high-level visits between China and the US, Cui said
both sides "showed a positive attitude towards the issue at the
talks."
</P>
<P>
Both sides believed that Sino-US high-level visits are
"indispensable for the development of normal, healthy relations
between the two countries" and they expressed the intention to
keep in touch on this subject, Cui said.
</P>
<P>
"We have also taken notice that recently US leaders, including
President Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher, made
a series of speeches on Sino-US relations, and they have indicated
the attention and importance attached to Sino-US relations," Cui
commented.
</P>
<P>
"We attach importance to their positive signs," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We believe we can be optimistic about the future of Sino-US
relations so long as both sides make continued efforts in
improving such relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li
Peng, Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, and State
Councillor and Defense Minister Chi Haotian met with Lake in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Liu Huaqiu, director of the Foreign Affairs Office under the
Chinese State Council, held talks with Lake, and had an exchange
of views with him in an extensive and in-depth manner on Sino-US
relations and other issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Lake's China visit was cut short by one day when he canceled
his trip to Shanghai, Cui noted, attributing this completely to
the restrictions of bad weather in Shanghai.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has been using the
Russian-made Mi-17 helicopters for transportation and medical
evacuations in operations against the outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK) in the southeast of the country, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Daily News said the helicopters are being used as transport
and hospital carriers in support of the massive state operations
aimed to wipe out the PKK rebels.
</P>
<P>
However, it reported quoted a Turkish military official as
saying that the 65-million-dollar purchase of 19 Mi-17s in 1995
was criticized by defense experts and the media in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Critics said that lack of spare parts and maintenance
support for the helicopters were the main problems, adding that
the helicopters stood idle here for months until sufficient spare
parts were flown in and the helicopters could be put into service
in the southeast of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 12-year guerrilla war for
self-rule in southeastern Turkey since August 1984.
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 people, including PKK rebels, civilians and
soldiers of the Turkish security forces, have been killed in
the armed clashes between the PKK and the security forces.
</P>
<P>
The 65-million-dollar agreement signed by Turkey and Russia in
1995 for the purchase of 19 Mi-17 helicopters was the result of a Russian
proposal to cover its nearly 200-million-dollar debt to Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Visits Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
arrived here this morning for a one-day working visit to Turkey
at the invitation of his Turkish counterpart Suleyman Demirel.
</P>
<P>
Demirel met Mubarak at the airport and the two presidents
flew to the presidential palace in Ankara by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
Demirel will soon hold a welcoming ceremony for Mubarak in
the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak is paying the working visit for a day of fence mending
with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Turkey and Egypt suffered when Egyptian
officials blasted Ankara's military accord with Israel and
actively campaigned against it in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
The agreement allows the Israeli jets to train in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing protests from the alarmed neighbors, Turkish
officials have defended the accord, saying it enables the
Turkish pilots to get electronic warfare training in Israel in
return for the favor granted to the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's suspicions center on fears that a new grouping is
emerging in the Middle East between Turkey, Jordan and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Egypt warned that the real intention of the Turco-Israeli
military accord was unclear.
</P>
<P>
In March, Demirel met with Mubarak in Aswan, Egypt, and
today's reciprocal visit is expected to focus on similar issues:
the Mideast Peace Process and Arab concerns over the
Turco-Israeli military agreement.

<P>
SHANGHAI, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Stock Exchange has
denied rumors that it will list state and legal person shares.
</P>
<P>
"The Shanghai Stock Exchange has never considered the matter of
listing state and legal person shares," an exchange official told
a meeting of senior executives of major securities brokerages here.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government and leaders attach great importance to
the well-being and development of Shanghai's securities market,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
"To rejuvenate state-owned enterprises we must do a good job to
develop the securities market and issue more stocks," he pointed
out. "This is management's consensus."
</P>
<P>
Ever-changing macro-economic developments and increasing
foreign exchange reserves and tax revenues, as well as other
factors, have combined to drive up the stock market, the official
said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Denies Japanese Statement on Newly-Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has denied that Japanese
scientists have found evidence pointing to the existence of an
unearthed pyramid in Sakkara, 15 kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Zahi Hawas, head of Egypt's Giza Plateau Antiquities
Directorate, said that the Japanese researchers' announcement is
groundless, Egypt's only English-language daily The Egyptian
Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the researchers claimed that they had
based their assumption on photos taken by a satellite, saying that
they were able to observe the foundation walls of the pyramid in
Sakkara.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the paper said, preliminary excavations by a
Japanese team revealed the remains of one wall.
</P>
<P>
But Hawas said that the Japanese mission is based in Dahshur,
35 kilometers south of Cairo, instead of Sakkara.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Halim Nureddin, Secretary General of the Egypt's Supreme
Council for Antiquities, also said that a report submitted by the
Japanese mission excavating in Dahshur is void of any reference to
the claimed discovery of the pyramid.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that none of the foreign or national excavating
teams in Egypt has the right to make announcements about new finds
until the Supreme Council for Antiquities has been officially
notified.
</P>
<P>
Hawas said that what the Japanese have found might be a tomb
rather than a pyramid.
</P>
<P>
He stated that an aerial survey had been previously conducted
in Sakkara revealing walls made of sun-dried bricks pertaining to
tombs rather than pyramids.
</P>
<P>
A total of 97 pyramids have been found in Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Real Estate Prices in Hanoi Falling Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 11 (Xinhua)-- The real estate prices in Hanoi, the
capital of Vietnam, have been tumbling, especially since last
February, according to Vietnamese press.
</P>
<P>
The falling prices have focused on apartments and simple
one-storey government-owned houses which can be rebuilt into
bigger and higher houses.
</P>
<P>
With the land and house prices as a premium, many lucky people
became man of wealth overnight.
</P>
<P>
During the 1994-1995 period, an apartment on the third or
fourth floor in Li Duc street of Hanoi's Hai Ba Trung precinct was
sold at one tael of gold per square meter.
</P>
<P>
However, now they are sold at only about half that price, and
even so it's difficult to find buyers.
</P>
<P>
In Ngoc Khanh and Thanh Cong residences of the city, houses
have been sold at only 10 to 20 percent of the prices asked.
</P>
<P>
The glut of mini-hotels and restaurants has played a big part
in the slump. Most mini-hotels do not operate to their capacity
and many have closed.
</P>
<P>
Land and housing prices are coming down not only in Hanoi but
also in other cities of the country.

<HEADLINE> Most of Chinese Workers Care About Income, Advanced Studies, Health: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese workers are paying more
attention to earning more income, receiving more education, and
maintaining their health, according to results of a national
survey.
</P>
<P>
The No. 1 desire of more than 65 percent of 1,153 workers
questioned at state-owned, collectively-owned and township
enterprises, and also in foreign-funded joint ventures throughout
the country, was to make more income.
</P>
<P>
About 35 percent of them said that they were more concerned
about pursuing advanced studies and upgrading knowledge, and 31
percent cared more about personal health and individual medical
care.
</P>
<P>
"The results reflected the change of Chinese workers' thoughts
and demands in the current market-economy period," said Liu
Xiayang, the survey organizer, and deputy director of the Public
Opinion Research Institute of the People's University in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"More Chinese people have come to understand the principle of
`survival of the fittest,' since social competition is getting
fierce," explained Liu. "And they are beginning to pay closer
attention to the need for self existence and development."
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China has been promoting reforms in the
state-owned enterprises, including the reform of the
"cradle-to-grave" welfare system.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, the burdens of improving incomes, housing, medical care
and in-service training have gradually transferred from the
shoulder of governments and enterprises to that of workers
themselves," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
"That is why so many surveyed workers showed solicitude for
those matters," he said.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed workers also were concerned about housing,
their children's education, and the protection of their personal
rights and interest, and to some extent, interpersonal
relationships with their colleagues.
</P>
<P>
It found that workers at the state-owned and collectively-owned
enterprises paid more attention to income, housing and medical
care than those employed by township enterprises and joint
ventures.
</P>
<P>
Township enterprise workers named on-the-job training as the
most important thing they wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
The survey also indicated that workers from various age groups
responded differently to many of the survey questions.
</P>
<P>
The first life choice for workers under 25 was education, while
workers older than 56 first considered health and medical care.
</P>
<P>
Those in the 26-55 age group cared more about income, housing,
education of children and mental health, the survey showed.

MANILA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Ministers from 18 members of the
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) today agreed to encourage
new approaches like monetary charges for the use of environment to
promote sustainable development in the region.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Environment Secretary Victor Ramos, who chairs the
two-day APEC ministerial meeting on sustainable development, told
reporters that the ministers have expressed support for the
proposal submitted by the APEC senior officials' meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministers agreed to encourage new approaches to
sustainable development. Among these new approaches are the use of
market-based instruments like monetary charges for the use of the
environment, information sharing and the application of
participatory management and capacity building.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of sustainable cities, the ministers also
indicated support for the promotion of exchanges of scientific and
technical knowledge, the sharing of experiences and technologies
between and among economies.
</P>
<P>
The delegates also backed the promotion of dialogue among
public and private sectors and non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the ministers have emphasized the need to integrate
environmental rehabilitation with economic development. For this
purpose, promotion of clean production and clean technology within
the region is a major item on the agenda of the two-day meeting
which will try to adopt the "APEC cleaner production strategy".

<HEADLINE> Offshore Oil Contract Debut In Taiwan Straits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- China National Offshore Oil Corp
(CNOOC) and the CPC oil company from Taiwan region today signed
the first oil cooperation contract, in Taipei, for offshore oil
exploration in the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
According to a CNOOC source, the contract area
covers the Tainan Basin and a depression in the offshore areas
of Chaoshan lying 150 km south of Guangdong province's Shantou
City, and 250 km west of Taiwan's Kaohsiung City, totalling
15,400 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The joint effort signals a major breakthrough in economic
cooperation between both sides of the Taiwan Straits and moves
cooperation to a higher level. It is significant that it
cooperates in meeting energy needs of both sides.
</P>
<P>
The two sides' representatives will blast a total of 1,500
kilometers of seismic lines and examine the seismic data for
possible oil exploitation in a 3,000-km stretch.
</P>
<P>
Total investment in undertaking the seismic survey is expected
to be one million US dollars, which will be handled on a
fifty-fifty basis, with each side holding a 50-percent stake in
the venture.
</P>
<P>
The source said that CNOOC and CPC will set up a joint
administrative group for carrying out the agreement, and all
decisions will be reached through friendly consultations.
</P>
<P>
If evidence of oil-bearing structures is found, the two sides
will reach a consensus before deciding on areas of exploration.
</P>
<P>
Oil specialists say that the contract area has good prospects
since seven oilfields with an expected combined annual production
of 10 million tons of crude have already been discovered in the
Zhujiang (Pearl) River Basin to the north and west of the Chaoshan
Basin.
</P>
<P>
In addition, CPC has drilled numerous wells in the Tainan Basin
which have rich natural gas resources.
</P>
<P>
Geologists with CNOOC and CPC have high hopes for the
exploratory work in the contract area. According to experts, the
Taiwan Straits, the East China Sea, and the South China Sea are
very rich in oil and gas resources. The continental shelves along
the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and South China Sea are
expected to have an aggregate oil and gas resources of 24.6
billion tons and 8 trillion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
To date, proven oil and gas reserves along the continental
shelves stand at 670 million tons and 109.5 billion cubic meters,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that potential for cooperation is extremely good
between the two sides and they are showing increasing interest in
joint oil development.
</P>
<P>
The source noted that CNOOC and CPC are both oil giants, and
the former has over 110 oil contracts with more than 60 oil
companies from 16 countries and regions, with annual oil
output of more than 13 million tons, while the latter is the
largest and only oil company in Taiwan region.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan region is extremely short of energy resources and CPC
imports more than 10 million tons of crude from the Middle East
and Australia yearly, as well as 2.2 million tons of liquified
natural gas from Indonesia and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Authorities here stress the fact that offshore oil cooperation
between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits will prove to be the
most effective and economical way to supply each other's energy
needs.

<HEADLINE> Foreigners to Observe Nigerian T.U. Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming delegates's
conference of the Nigeria Labor Congress (NLC) will be witnessed
by foreign observers to show that the government has no hidden
agenda on the democratization of trade unions.
</P>
<P>
The arrangements are being finalized to ensure that notable
foreign labor leaders should attend the conference, r. j. a.
Hobobo, NLC National Secretary, said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to him, it was initially decided to invite
organizations such as the International Labor Organization (ILC),
the Organization of African Trade Union Unity and perhaps the
International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
</P>
<P>
''However, at the ILC conference which ended in Geneva on June
20, many African countries, especially the French-speaking ones
indicated interest to attend,'' Hobobo said.
</P>
<P>
Hobobo said that the exact date of the conference would soon
be announced and the secretariat was fully prepared to carry it
out successfully.
</P>
<P>
The executive of NLC was dissolved in August 1994 following a
strike action. Consequently, a sole administrator, Ason Bur, was
appointed by the government but later replaced by Alhaji Ahmed
Gusau, who has restructured the 41 industrial unions to 29.
</P>
<P>
A delegates' conference earlier fixed for May 28 to 31 in the
capital of Abuja was aborted because of disagreement among labor
leaders arising from decree 4 of 1996 that banned general
secretaries and other employees of industrial unions from
contesting elections.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of industrial unions who have now mended fences have
asked the Head of State General Sani Abacha to amend the decree
to enable all trade unionists, whether elected or employed, to
contest election, but is not yet clear if this request will be
met.

its economic development picks up pace.
</P>
<P>
By building trial ecological villages, pollution was
successfully controlled and resources more fully utilized in rural
areas, according to the local government.
</P>
<P>
The local government began the trials in the mid-1980s, with
rebuilding forests as the key.
</P>

</P>
<P>
In the process of protecting the ecological environment, the
local government has given its priority to the improvement of the
living environment. A number of fruit bases have been set up, and
rural energy and pesticide projects carried out.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, efforts have been made in the control of fertilizer
pollution and pollution by township enterprises.
</P>

<HEADLINE> US Computer Company Introduces New Technology to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Hewlett-Packard, the United
States' third largest computer manufacturer, has introduced a
series of Pentium Pro products to China to stay abreast the
Pentium technology trend.
</P>
<P>
The HP products, ranging from personal computers, servers, and
work stations to networks, are the company's latest technical
breakthroughs. They made their Chinese debut on June 25.
</P>
<P>
The move will cause stiffer competitions among Pentium
Pro-based computer products in China, an area which has several
big names, in IBM, AST, and Compaq, say local industry experts.
</P>
<P>
The Pentium Pro, regarded as the likely candidate for the next
generation of computer processors after the arrival of the Pentium
chip, was first brought to China by Intel Company in the fourth
quarter of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Dennis Mark Weng Leong, marketing manager of HP's personal
information products group of the Asian-Pacific Region, says that
the company's Pentium Pro products were displayed in five Chinese
cities in a road-show this spring. Their major clients are big
enterprises and commercial and financial agencies.

<HEADLINE> There's Monkey Business During Class at Chinese School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- If there's monkey business during
the lessons at a school in China it's hardly surprising.
</P>
<P>
Lazy students at Zhoushuizi Primary School in Dalian are
suddenly attentive. And there are feathers flying in the
schoolyard.
</P>
<P>
It is all because the school has opened its very own
zoo. Pupils can share their lessons with monkeys, sheep, hedgehogs
and a variety of birds.
</P>
<P>
The school, in Ganjingzi District of Dalian City in northeast
China's Liaoning Province, has so far 'enrolled' more than 300
small animals and birds. The idea is to give the pupils easier
access to wildlife.
</P>
<P>
Each class at the school take turns feeding the animals and
birds, and cleaning their mini-zoo.
</P>
<P>
"A few students who used to be particularly lazy are now
interested in their work," said a teacher of the school.
</P>
<P>
"Contacts with animals will not only benefit pupils' physical
and psychological health, but also improve their sense of
environmental protection."
</P>
<P>
Soon the school is to bring in 200 pigeons to fly around the
school playground.
</P>
<P>
Lessons in nature and wildlife have taken on a new meaning for
the pupils at Zhoushuizi school, who have welcomed their
new 'classmates' with open arms.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientists Discover New Genetic Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Scientists of Tel Aviv
University have discovered a rare new genetic disease and
identified the defective gene that causes it, the Jerusalem Post
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Named TA-24 in honor of the university, the disease --
which makes patients extremely sensitive to sunlight -- has been
recognized by the scientific community.
</P>
<P>
Professor Hanoch Slor of the Sackler School of Medicine's
human genetics department, headed a team that discovered the
disorder, which involves faulty ability to repair the DNA in
the genes (or transcription-coupled DNA repair).
</P>
<P>
For several years, Slor's team conducted research on a
related disease, xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), in which patients are
extremely sensitive to ultraviolet light. It causes the
irreversible appearance of pigments in the skin and skin
growths.
</P>
<P>
Discovered in 1968, XP involves the inability of the body to
repair damage to the DNA in all the cell's genes. It can be
detected during the early stages of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
Since most chemotherapy drugs used for treating cancer work
by linkage with the DNA and preventing the cell from
dividing, XP patients are 1,000 times as sensitive to UV
rays and to chemotherapy drugs. Chemotherapy can cause them
serious harm and even kill them.
</P>
<P>
Since XP patients suffer from tumors, doctors must be very
careful not to give them chemotherapy drugs that act like UV
light on their DNA.
</P>
<P>
For the past 14 years, Slor and his colleagues have been
treating a youngster who is hypersensitive to UV light. He was
suspected of being a member of one of the 30 Israeli families
suffering XP. A few minutes of exposure during midday caused
serious him burns -- but very little pigmentation characteristic
of XP was produced.
</P>
<P>
Using a technique developed in England to test DNA repair,
they found that his general DNA repair was normal, but that
only specific ("active") genes were unable to repair their DNA.
The body's parents -- cousins of Iranian origin -- show no
sensitivity to the sun.
</P>
<P>
Since XP causes permanent pigmentation of the skin, and the
little pigmentation that the youngster developed quickly faded
away, Slor concluded that he was suffering from a different,
previously unidentified disease.
</P>
<P>
It is not known how many people in the world suffer
from TA-24, but the importance of the discovery, says Slor, is
the characterization of the process responsible for DNA repair
in active genes.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Population Amounts to 20 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's population at present is
approximately 20 million, reported the local daily "the New
Vision" today.
</P>
<P>
Dan Sentamu, Director of the National Curriculum Development
Center was quoted as saying that Uganda's population has been in
recent decades growing at an average of 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
"This figure," he said, "is quite high as we can note from
some of the existing census figures."
</P>
<P>
For example in 1948, he said, the population of Uganda was 4.9
million while in 1991 it had grown to 16.7 million in a space of
43 years.
</P>
<P>
He lamented that the problem resulted from rapid population
growth in relation to limited resources and the poor quality of
life for the majority of people in the country.
</P>
<P>
Today, he said, most schools are crowded because of the
increasing numbers of school going children without a
corresponding increase in the number of schools.
</P>
<P>
another example related to the above mentioned issue is that
many children cannot go to school because their parents do not
have enough money to send them to, he said, adding that the
female child in the family is always the victim.

<HEADLINE> China Readjusts Building Materials Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- China has mapped out an ambitious
program to readjust its fledging building materials industry by
focusing on new building materials and products that will bring in
high economic returns.
</P>
<P>
The country's building materials industry has expanded rapidly,
showing a yearly growth rate of more than ten percent in cement,
glass and sanitary ceramics production, said Qiao Longde,
vice-chairman of the State Administration of Building Materials
Industry.
</P>
<P>
Qiao recently spoke at a press conference for China Building
Materials '96, which will be held at the China World Trade Center
un November.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the country's building materials industry brought in
260 billion yuan in output value, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the vice chairman, China invested 17 billion yuan
in the construction of 41 large and medium-sized projects; 25 have
been put into production.
</P>
<P>
The effort led to an increase of more than 10 million tons of
high-quality cement, 3.6 million cases of float glass and 20,000
tons of high-quality refractory materials. Three production bases
that produce building materials and sanitary ceramics products --
Tangshan, Boshan and Foshan -- have been established.
</P>
<P>
He said 2.5 billion US dollars of overseas capital was
channeled into the building materials industry, an amount five
times the total used in the past ten years. More than 100 joint
ventures were set up using 100 million US dollars in overseas
capital in Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The official said the building materials sector made 2.2
billion US dollars from exports in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Although China's building materials industry claims a fairly
large output for its number of enterprises, Qiao pointed out the
sector has also been plagued by high energy consumption, low
productivity, poor economic returns, enormous waste in resources
and serious pollution.
</P>
<P>
As a result, China will implement its readjustment program in
three steps: First, in the next five years, China will concentrate
on improving the quality of building materials products and new
materials using extensive technological innovation and eliminating
outdated procedures.
</P>
<P>
Second, between 2000 and 2010, China will focus on the
modernization of production of items such as plate glass and
sanitary ceramics, mostly in coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
Finally, China will promote the development of new building
materials, non-metallic minerals, and inorganic non-metalic new
materials in order to build a modern, internationally competitive
building materials industry.

<HEADLINE> Thai Woman Accused of Abusing Laotian Child Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 11 (Xinhua) -- A Thai woman employer has been
arrested here on charges of committing brutal acts against two
Laotian teenage girls, including branding one of them with a hot
iron, the Bangkok Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Wipaporn Tangtraporn, 39, owner of a glove factory in Bangkok,
was charged with assault and inflicting injury to others and
employing child labors.
</P>
<P>
The two girls, 14-year-old Suay and 11-year-old Noy, said their
employer used a hot iron and boiling water to keep them awake and
made them swallow insecticide when they tried to escape.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Post today carried a picture showing two large burn
marks on Suay's back just under the shoulder blades. One of the
marks is a triangular scar about 15 centimeters (six inches) long.
</P>
<P>
Police said Suay told them that her employer placed the hot
iron on her back to punish her for forgetting to unplug it.
</P>
<P>
Noy, who also suffered skin burns, said her employer poured
boiling water over her to prevent her from falling asleep in work,
which often last for 22 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
The two girls said they were never paid in their four months
working at the factory although they had been promised a monthly
salary of 1,000 baht and 800 baht (40 and 32 US dollars)
respectively.
</P>
<P>
They are now in hospital after being rescued by police in a
raid on the glove factory earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The factory owner is also facing a charge of employing foreign
labor without authorization, which carries a maximum penalty of
three years in jail and/or a fine of 60,000 baht (2,400 US
dollars), the report said.

MOSCOW, July 11 (Xinhua) -- At least five people were injured
by a bomb blast in a trolley-bus in the center of Moscow Thursday
morning, said the Itar-Tass news agency here today.
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred at about 9 a.m. (local time) when the
trolley-bus was nearing the city's Pushkin Square, which is about
one kilometer form the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
There were few people on the bus at the time.
</P>
<P>
The driver's cabin and the front of the bus was seriously
damaged as the explosives were put under the front door, the
Interior Ministry was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the accident is still under investigation. But
some investigators said the preliminary evidence showed that it
was "a terrorist act."
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred when the Russian troops were blocking
and bombing the Chechen leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev's
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
It was the second blast on Moscow's transportation system in a
month. Four people were killed in a bomb explosion on June 11 in
the Moscow subway, which the authorities called "an act of
terrorism."
</P>
<P>
The blast accidents had been obviously decreased since an
agreement was reached between the Russian government and Chechen
rebels on May 27.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu Farmers Say Good-Bye to Old Villages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Modern towns and centrally-located
villages are springing up in east China's Jiangsu province as
older villages vanish with the changing patterns of life.
</P>
<P>
According to the local government, natural villages, with their
irrational layout and lack of facilities, can no longer meet the
demands of farmers and rural economic development.
</P>
<P>
To improve farmers' standard of living, the local government
came up with a plan by the end of June to speed up construction of
towns and central villages, whereby 40 percent of the farmers will
move to rationally designed, functional towns and central villages
by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for the construction of 1,986 new towns in the
province.
</P>
<P>
Jiangdu City, in the center of the province is one example,
with its 4,627 natural villages that will merged into 288 central
villages by 2010.
</P>
<P>
With improved infrastructure facilities, the towns and the
central villages will make life more convenient for farmers, while
helping protect soil resources and poor farmers by merging rich
villages and poor ones.

<P>
TEHRAN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government today
refuted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's allegation
that Iran is acquiring atomic bombs.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Hussein Sheikholeslam said
"Iran's doors are open to international inspectors and there are
no restrictions as our nuclear facilities are for peaceful
endeavors."
</P>
<P>
In a report carried in today's English-language daily
Tehran Times, he said that international inspectors from the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) visited Iran several
times and confirmed that Iran plans to use atomic energy for
peaceful purposes only.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official also denounced Netanyahu for his recent
hardline statements, saying that "he violated all international
laws and norms. Netanyahu is the one who reneged on all
commitments made by his predecessor."
</P>
<P>
"Look at his cabinet ... it's cabinet of warriors and
criminals such as Ariel Sharon, who was responsible for the
massacre of the Palestinians in Sabra and Shatila," he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "members of the Netanyahu cabinet believe in a
greater Israel and they are expansionists."
</P>
<P>
On U.S.-Israeli collaboration, Sheikholeslam said, "they both
dance to the same tune and hail each other."

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Shaoguan, a tourist resort area
in south China's Guangdong Province, is striving to come up with
at least 800 million yuan in overseas investment for
infrastructure, industry, agriculture, and tourist facilities.
</P>
<P>
According to Tang Weidong, acting mayor of the city, the money
is to be used on 80 projects, 29 of them in industry, 16 in
agriculture, eight for technology exports, 13 in transfer of
shares, and six for tourist projects.
</P>
<P>
As a tourist attraction, the city will concentrate on building
tourist facilities, using tourist resources, and building tourist
parks.
</P>
<P>
As a stop-over between coastal cities and inland areas,
Shaoguan last year attracted 3.4 times as much foreign investment
as it did in 1990, and its export volume doubled.
</P>
<P>
Domestic and foreign investment have helped improve a number of
state-owned enterprises such as a local brewery, a pharmaceutical
plant, and a gear works.
</P>
<P>
Tang said the city is planning to improve 1,900 industries by
turning them into joint ventures, or leasing and selling
them. Moreover, the city's high quality rice, bamboo, maize,
gingkos and pulpwood have also been listed as key areas for
overseas investment.  Endtiem

HAIKOU, July 11 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 foreign-funded
enterprises on south China's Hainan Island have bought
unemployment insurance for more than 5,200 employees.
</P>
<P>
The southern province developed a detailed set of rules on
unemployment among urban residents in 1994, requiring all

insurance policies that amount to more than 50,000 yuan in total.
</P>
<P>
The official pointed out, however, that some foreign-funded

western China over the next 10 or 15 years.
</P>
<P>
It wants to regain some of its former glory when it enjoyed the
status as imperial capital of China and starting point of the
Great Silk Road.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to cater to the country's overall plan to shift its
emphasis on economic expansion to the west.
</P>
<P>
The country's reform and opening-up drive, which was initiated
in 1979, brought an economic boom in some of its coastal
areas. However, many of China's hinterlands are still economically
less-advantaged.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an's city authorities say that they will not miss the
opportunity to regain Xi'an's status as a commercial and trade hub
in history.
</P>
<P>
The city, once called Chang'an in ancient times, was China's
old capital over 12 dynasties. It was known as a trade center of
China, even of the world, during those glory days of old.
</P>
<P>
It aroused great concern that in Han Dynasty (206 b.c - 220
a.d.), China opened the Silk Road, linking up with central and
west Asia, India and the European continent, with Chang'an as the
starting point of the road.
</P>
<P>
History only tells the past. Though Xi'an today has become a
world-renowned tourist attraction for its typical ancient Chinese
culture, it shows no signs at all of being a flourishing trade
center.
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Chinese President Jiang Zemin wrote an
inscription for the city, which reads, "To build Xi'an into a
socialist open city, depending on science, technology, tourism,
commerce, and trade."
</P>
<P>
As part of the effort to achieve this goal, Xi'an city is
projected to build five to ten large enterprises in charge of
commodity distribution, which are expected to have a very sharp
competitive edge in both overseas and domestic markets, and nearly
70,000 commercial and trade services over the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
By doing so, the city's total retail volume is expected to
reach 40 billion yuan by the year 2000, and 130 billion yuan by
2010, growing by 20 percent a year.

<HEADLINE> APEC Ministerial Meeting on Sustainable Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Environment ministers from 18
member economies of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
began here today to discuss how to harmonize the sustainable
development of economy and the preservation of environment.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting will exam draft guidelines worked out by
APEC senior officials at a meeting held here on July 9-10. These
guidelines include how to promote sustainable development in mega
cities, recommendations for clean technology and clean production,
exchange of technology and information and the private-public
partnership in the sustainable development in the region.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony this morning, Philippine President
Fidel Ramos called on APEC members to lay equal emphasis on the
sustainability of economic development and the protection of
environment.
</P>
<P>
"Economic growth should not come at the expense of the
environment or put it another way, that the environment should not
be sacrificed on the express train of economic growth", he said.
</P>
<P>
The president listed some elements that are threatening the
sustainable development in the region. The elements, according to
Ramos, include persistent poverty and inequity in income
distribution, high cost of social reform and persistent market
access problems for developing members.
</P>
<P>
He said that the developed members should continue to undertake
market opening measures for the products of developing members.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to both developed and developing members to
cooperate closely in the issues being discussed.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the meeting, the delegates will try to adopt an
action plan on sustainable development and a ministerial
declaration on sustainable development at APEC.

<P>
"After years of development, Xi'an city now has many advantages
to boost commerce and trade," said Cui Lintao, secretary of the
city CPC committee.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995), the city's retail
sales rose by an annual average of 21.43 percent, reaching 18
billion yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
The city's 1995 retail volume ranked first among seven
provincial capitals -- Xi'an, Lanzhou, Urumqi, Yinchuan, Xining,
Taiyuan, and Zhengzhou, in central and western parts of China.
</P>
<P>
Last year Xi'an built 82,000 commercial service networks at a
total cost of 1.03 billion yuan. About 430,000 people were
reportedly involved in commercial business.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an now operates nearly 50 air routes, ranking third in China
and first in central and western China.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an has a telephone switchboard of 300,000 lines. Three
national optic fiber cables have been built, and another three are
under construction.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an ranks in third place in terms of comprehensive scientific
and technological strengths in China, only after Beijing and
Shanghai, with 345,000 experts in various fields. The number of
college students, out of every 10,000 head of population in the
city is the highest in China.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an boasts approximately 600 laboratories for different
research purposes, including 24 state key labs. It takes a lead in
China in developing and making research on aeronautics,
astronautics, machinery, power equipment, optic instruments and
meters.
</P>
<P>
And Xi'an is a foreign exchange and securities hub in northwest
China, with more than 1,800 banks and other financial
institutions. Xi'an's residents are reported to have a total of 30
billion yuan in cash and deposits.
</P>
<P>
"The key is to turn the resources into economic advantages."
Cui said.

<HEADLINE> APEC to Apply Environment-Friendly Standard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum will seek the use of the International
Standard Order (ISO) 14000 for a cleaner environment for
sustainable development, environment ministers of the 18 APEC
members agreed at a meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
The ISO 14000, a system grading and evaluating industries on
the basis of their environmental activities or their capability to
integrate environment protection with the production process, is
expected to be approved within the APEC by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Philippine Environment Undersecretary Delfin
Ganapin, the ISO 14000 is different from "green labeling," which
some reports said that APEC was pushing for.
</P>
<P>
He said the ISO 14000 focuses on the production system while
"green labeling" pays attention only to the product itself.
</P>
<P>
Ganapin noted that the promotion of the ISO 14000 will be to
the advantage of the developing economies of the APEC forum in the
long run.
</P>
<P>
"We promote the ISO 14000 but at the same time, parallel to it,
we promote technology transfer and transfer of expertise so that
the industries in the developing economies will be easily able to
meet the requirements of the ISO 14000," he said.

<HEADLINE> Tumen River Development in Different Stages (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts have come up
with a theory explaining the development of the Tumen River
region, which includes parts of China, Russia, and the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea, using different spaces and stages.
</P>
<P>
Chen Cai and Yuan Shuren, both are doctoral advisors at the
Research Center on Northeast Asia at Northeast China Normal
University, have been doing research on "Local Characteristics of
the Tumen River Zone and its Time and Space Development Modes."
</P>
<P>
The research is part of China's major social science programs,
and took Chen, Yuan and colleagues three years to complete.
</P>
<P>
They say that in the region's development, there are three
geological zones described as concentric circles. The inner one
includes China, Russia, and the DPRK. The second circle includes
Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Mongolia, countries that have
direct relations with the development. The outer circle includes
the United States, UN organizations, and several districts that
can help and can benefit from development of the region.
</P>
<P>
Chen and other scholars predict that, because the region lacks
a strong economic foundation and because the transformation from
cold-war confrontation to all-round co-operation will take time,
development will be divided into three stages:
</P>
<P>
From 1996 to 2000, China, Russia, and the DPRK will develop the
region separately, while co-operating tentatively. They will
intensify construction work on highways, railways,
telecommunications, ports, and other infrastructure in their own
territory to build a foundation for future co-operation.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The earthquake that hit
Tangshan City in north China's Hebei Province on July 28, 1976
left 240,000 people dead, more than 164,000 people seriously
injured, over 360,000 slightly wounded, and 3,817 people
paraplegics.
</P>
<P>
There were 7,218 families completely wiped out, more than
15,000 people who lost their spouses, and 4,204 children left as
orphans.
</P>
<P>
In addition to that, some 12,100 people who were in Tangshan
for short-term work, study, or visiting relatives, were killed.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake was 7.8 on the Richter Scale, a rare seismic
disaster in Chinese history, almost completely destroying a
100-year old city with a population of more than one million.
</P>
<P>
It destroyed 14 million square meters of public buildings and
5.3 million dwellings. Economic losses were calculated at 30
billion yuan (about 3.8 billion US dollars), at 1976 prices.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake's tremors seriously affected Beijing and Tianjin
and its destruction could be seen in a 30,000-square-kilometers
area, and felt in China's 14 provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions with a combined area accounting for one-third
of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Seismological Bureau, this was the first
such earthquake in China.
</P>
<P>
Although there had been forecasts, no short-term ones had been
made and no estimation of its magnitude. It occurred when most of
Tangshan's citizens were fast asleep, and 80 percent of them were
buried under rubbles before they had time to respond.
</P>
<P>
Alongside railways running through the city's urban area, some
47 square kilometers, damage was most catastrophic. It destroyed
all buildings there, and an eight-kilometer long crack in the
ground ran in a northeasterly direction, the largest horizontal
separation being 2.3 meters, with a vertical separation of more
than 70 cm.

<P>
On reasons for the boom, the report said it is, among others,
the prevailing peace and stability across the country since 1986
that attracts tourists to visit Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Eco-tourism, a different style of tourism in the country is
another reason for Uganda to attract tourists, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Each of the three east African countries have something unique
to themselves. Tanzania is the best for wildlife, Kenya has the
best beaches, and Uganda's forests are the best south of Sahara.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's position is particularly well-placed, because all its
new 10 national parks are forest oriented, the report said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, it said, Uganda-based tourism operators are now a
threat to the Kenya-based ones. Even the Tanzanians are, it
added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Families Becoming More Democratic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey has shown that
China's families are becoming more democratic as the relations
between husbands and wives, parents and children become more equal.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the males and more than half of the females
surveyed expressed disagreement with the idea that "men should pay
more attention to society while women pay more to the family".
</P>
<P>
In Shenzhen, in south China's Guangdong Province, a life of
young couples managing their own properties is now in vogue, and
love as a factor young people consider when setting up a family is
common.
</P>
<P>
In a survey of 1,441 families of farmers in northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province, 64.5 percent said that "love plays the most
important part in family life."
</P>
<P>
Those couples who think that love no longer exists are now more
likely to divorce rather than endure a loveless marriage.
</P>
<P>
The family democracy is also mirrored in the relationship
between parents and children, the survey showed. Parents are no
longer the domineering authority and the views of children are
given more attention, the survey showed.

<HEADLINE> China Stresses Prosperity of Developing APEC Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The prosperity of the developing
members of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum is
critical to the region's sustainable development, a Chinese
delegate said at the APEC Ministerial Meeting on Sustainable
Development that opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Ye Ruqiu, deputy administrator of China's National
Environmental Protection Agency, called for full consideration of
giving priorities to the growth of the developing members.
</P>
<P>
Describing economy disparities as a major obstacle to
sustainable development, Ye said that the only solution is to
boost economic prosperity and eliminate poverty in the developing
APEC members.
</P>
<P>
"As they grow stronger, their capability of implementing
sustainable development can be improved," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the creation of favorable external
conditions for the sustainable development of these APEC members.
</P>
<P>
China is "strongly against transferring pollution and dumping
wastes to the developing members and using environmental issues to
create new trade protectionism," Ye said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that sustainable development should be given priority
in economic and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government always regards sustainable development
as a necessity and an important strategy for future development
and has taken practical measures for its implementation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ye urged all members of the region to participate in the
efforts to promote the coordination and cooperation in environment
and sustainable development.

<HEADLINE> Bedouin Tribe in Jerusalem Faces Eviction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 11 (Xinhua) -- A Bedouin tribe on the
outskirts of Jerusalem is caught between Israel and the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA), according to a Jerusalem
Post report today.
</P>
<P>
Earth movers this week began working three meters from one
of six Jahalin Bedouin encampments in the path of Ma'aleh
Adomim, northeast of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli High Court imposed an August 28 deadline on
the tribe to move to another site allocated to it, but
members of the tribe said they are torn between the Israeli
order and PNA orders.
</P>
<P>
The new site is closer to Abu Dis, an area which had
already been handed over to the PNA, and PNA officials said
the land to which the tribe is being relocated is private
land belonging to residents of the town.
</P>
<P>
Although some 100 Jahalin families already live there, they
have no permanent right of residence, while the 49 others
(about 400 people) ordered to move refused to do so.
</P>
<P>
They said that they fear they will be victimized by the
PNA as collaborators if they move with an Israeli assurance
that their relocation is permanent, and they would not move
if it only means they can be shifted again.
</P>
<P>
The Jahalin fled the Negev in southern Israel in 1950 and
settled in the Judean desert under Jordanian rule. It is situated
on way to Jericho and safe from the encroachment of Israel's
developing society on the Negev Bedouin.
</P>
<P>
In 1967, they found themselves under Israeli rule again,
and in the most rapidly developing settlement area of all,
furthermore, the land where they lived was declared state land
in 1981.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the civil administration began talking to them and in
1993, the year that witnessed the signing of the Oslo accord
between Israel and the Palestinians, they were offered alternative
sites.
</P>
<P>
They then chose Abu Dis-Kedar, to which water and power
line as well as a road were extended, but now the Jahalin
also have to contend with the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Radio reported after a meeting between Jahalin
representatives and PNA President Yasser Arafat that Arafat
rejected "attempts at occupation" by the Israeli authorities.
</P>
<P>
Abu Dis is also the home of Palestinian Council Chairman
Ahmed Qeria, apparently one of those with land claims in the
area.
</P>
<P>
The council appointed a seven-member committee to help the
Jahalin stand fast against settlement expansion, arguing it is
their land, they are Palestinians, and they may not be
forcibly moved under international law.
</P>
<P>
While 45 years of relative quiet came to an end this
week with bulldozers, trucks, and earth movers encircling camps,
sheep pens, and even individual tents and huts, the Jahalin
said they are not nomads.
</P>
<P>
Israel is offering them the right to build homes in the
new site, if they can find the money, but the PNA will
not tolerate that.

NANJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- A type of learning that used to be

popular once again in many Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
With the development of the economy and improving standards of

</P>
<P>
In big Chinese cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing,
Guangzhou and Zhengzhou, part-time training courses on family
health care, nutrition, education of children, the family, and
clothing design are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
At Jinling Women's College of Nanjing Normal University, the

eight training courses that have been attended by over 800 people.
</P>
<P>
The university has also been authorized to train teachers of
home economics for high schools, vocational schools, and secondary
schools.

in spite of its having been split into three separate companies.
</P>
<P>
Art Kobler, president of Communication Service Group of AT&AMP;T
(China), said that the newly-established company, which retains
the AT&AMP;T name, will handle all telecommunications services started
by the old AT&AMP;T over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The largest foreign telecom business in China, AT&AMP;T opened a
dozen international telecommunications bisinesses ranging from
direct dial, optical digital transmission, software defined
network, and the Internet to satellite digital communications.
</P>
<P>
The company's restructuring, announced last September, will be
complete by the beginning of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Kobler said the company's Chinese business will increase with
the rapid growth in the country's telecommunications industry and
the increase in multinationals here.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications
show that, by the end of last June, China's telephone density
reached 5.47 per cent, and the number of e-mail and Internet
subscribers hit 8,855 and 12,000, respectively.
</P>
<P>
He said that owing to its huge population and economic
potential, a 30 percent-odd growth in telecommunications industry
in China can be maintained through the next century. So the
company's development in China will be among the top priorities of
its Asian and Pacific business.
</P>
<P>
The new AT&AMP;T has yearly sales of 51 billion US dollars, keeping
it among the leading telecom carriers in the world.

<HEADLINE> Shanxi's Mt. Wutai International Tourism Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Mt. Wutai, the highest peak in
north China and home of one of China's greatest Buddhist shrines,
will be the site of the 7th Mt. Wutai International Tourism Month,
from July 25 to August 25.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 40 temples and ancient buildings on the
3,058-meter-high mountain, which has been venerated by Buddhists
as a sacred site since 58 A.D., and with Emei Mountain in Sichuan,
Jiuhua Mountain in Anhui, and Putuo Mountain in Zhejiang, is one
of Buddhism's most important sites.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wangcheng, a Wutai County official, said that tourists
can visit temples, ancient buildings, forest parks and watch
performances of Buddhist rites.
</P>
<P>
A trade fair will also be held during tourism month, with over
100 new products of electronics, light industry, building
materials, chemical, food, and clothing to be shown.
</P>
<P>
Mt. Wutai was listed in 1982 among China's highest group of
state-level scenic spots and historical sites. Wutai County has
put some 200 million yuan (24 million U.S. dollars) into building
the tourist area since then.
</P>
<P>
About 400,000 Chinese and overseas tourists visit Mt. Wutai
each year.

<HEADLINE> New-type Oasis Agriculture Road Could Mean Wealth For West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- A new type of agriculture may
become the royal road to prosperity for arid, desert regions in
western China, and help narrow the economic gap between eastern
and western parts of the country, according to a senior scientist.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture is doing especially well in the Hexi Corridor
in Gansu Province, Vice-Chairman of the China Association for
Science and Technology Liu Shu said at a symposium on investment
in middle and western regions.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, the "new-type" agriculture means that, under
vulnerable, arid, and water-short conditions, new artificial
control measures are used, with a "more light, less water
consumption, new technology and high output" model.
</P>
<P>
Liu, who is a researcher in prevention and treatment of desert
disasters, says the model includes use of plastic film mulching
technology in large areas, the use of greenhouses to increase
production, and drip irrigation and other water-saving irrigation
measures.
</P>
<P>
The new-type oasis agriculture was pioneered by a prominent
scientist, Qian Xuesen, a decade ago, and will markedly improve
natural resource use, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Liu cited the example of Israel, which has per capita fresh
water resources of less than 300 cubic m, but five percent of the
gross national product and 6.56 percent of the national foreign
currency earnings come from only 3.5 percent of the national labor
resources.
</P>
<P>
Israeli technology is not mysterious, and what they have
achieved can also be achieved in west China, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
He proposed making the new-type oasis agriculture a popular
mode of agriculture in the region and called on governments at all
levels in the region to perfect the green house technique, mainly
by improving the durability and intake of light, accelerating the
use of value-added plants and animals fit for cultivation in green
houses, and improving management to avoid possible mold diseases
and "white pollution" caused by waste plastic.

<HEADLINE> East Coastal People Urged to Flee Hurricane in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Nearly one million coastal
residents and tourists have been urged to evacuate as Hurricane
Bertha churns on towards the east coast of the United States with
165 kph winds.
</P>
<P>
About 500,000 people were ordered to evacuate six Florida
counties on Wednesday. Another 50,000 were urged to get off
Hatteras and Ocracoke islands on North Carolina's Outer Banks.
</P>
<P>
Officials also urged the evacuation of parts of two South
Carolina counties with 380,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
In Georgia, more than 1,000 Olympic officials were being
evacuated from the yachting venue on the coast and were moving
competition yachts inland. They also took down tents and removed
technology, computers and data bases from the site.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA) moved its Florida space shuttle Atlantis off its launch pad
to the shelter of a hangar. And the Navy ordered ships out to sea
to avoid being battered against the docks.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton cancelled a flight to Florida on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bertha, growing in the Caribbean, arrived in the Bahamas on
Tuesday. The winds increased to 180 kph early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. National Weather Service has issued a hurricane watch
for the coast of Carolina and parts of Georgia and Virginia,
fearing that Bertha would approach the region on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At 8 p.m. eastern standard time on Wednesday, the hurricane was
centered about 120 kilometers northeast of Great Abaco in the
Bahamas, and about 320 kilometers east of the Florida coast. It
was moving northwest at about 24 kph, the Associated Press said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, meteorologists had predicted the storm would take a
gradual right turn during the day and its strongest wind and rain
would move on a course parallel to the U.S Atlantic Coast. But it
has been moving northwesterly toward Florida.
</P>
<P>
The Hurricane brushed by Puerto Rico on Monday, then the Turks
and Caicos Islands on Tuesday. Three people were killed in
storm-related accidents in Puerto Rico and one in the Virgin
Islands.
</P>
<P>
Also in Puerto Rico on Monday, the Coast Guard reported that a
boat with as many as 42 people aboard was crippled.

<HEADLINE> Steel Prices Expected to Rise in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Steel prices in India are
expected to go up by 10 percent to offset the enhanced
transportation, energy and production costs following the recent
fuel price hike, the Times of India said today.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government has recently announced massive price
hikes between 15 percent and 30 percent in petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting for the railway and general budgets to know how
much will be the exact additional burden," Steel Authority of
India Limited (SAIL) Chairman R.R. Nair was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The increase in steel prices could be in the 8-10 percent
range, Nair said.
</P>
<P>
SAIL is the largest steel maker in India.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Chernomyrdin to Head New Russian Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Just days after Russian President
Boris Yeltsin's re-election, the question of the possible division
of portfolios in the new government has taken over the entire
post-election agenda.
</P>
<P>
As Yeltsin stated on Wednesday, Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin will stay on and is ordered to prepare the list of
the new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Although Yeltsin said that he does not oppose including
representatives of different political parties in the new
government, Communist Party leaders are unlikely to get any
key posts in the new cabinet, analysts here believe.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no room for (Communist Party leader Gennady)
Zyuganov in the new cabinet," Vyacheslav Nikonov, former deputy
chief of Yeltsin's election campaign team, told the Moscow Tribune
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The idea of a coalition cabinet, advocated by the Communists,
will not work in Russia, which is a presidential, not
parliamentary, republic," Nikonov said.
</P>
<P>
Economics Minister Yevgeny Yasin, who is likely to keep his
post in the new cabinet, on Monday echoed Chernomyrdin's remarks
as he also rejected the Communists' participation in the new
government.
</P>
<P>
Yasin said that the new team -- which will not be announced
until the inauguration of Yeltsin next month for his second term
-- would be selected by Chernomyrdin and Alexander Lebed, the new
secretary of the powerful Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, drawn into the Kremlin inner circle ahead of last week's
runoff, has used his promotion to sound off on a variety of
issues, some of which fall directly under the prime minister's
remit.
</P>
<P>
Despite Lebed's demands for greater power, Yasin said the
retired general's rise would have a positive effect on the new
administration.
</P>
<P>
"We need a man of decisions," Yasin said, adding that Lebed
would play "a decisive role" in the fight against crime.
</P>
<P>
But Alexander Livshits, Yeltsin's chief economic adviser, said
that Lebed would not get the broad economic powers he has been
seeking. The full responsibility for economic policy would remain
with Chernomyrdin, he added.
</P>
<P>
In response, Lebed, who reiterated his earlier demands for a
key role in economic affairs, said he was looking for a deputy for
economic policy. "By the end of the summer or early fall an
economic and financial crisis is expected," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chernomyrdin met Yabloko's leader Grogory Yavlinsky
on Tuesday for consultations over possible new candidates for key
economic posts in the new government.
</P>
<P>
Though unlikely to enter the government himself, Yavlinsky has
been promoting Yabloko's Mikhail Zadornov -- who currently heads
the State Duma (lower house of parliament) Budget Committee -- to
get a high economic post in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky told reporters after his meeting with Chernomyrdin
that he plans to continue negotiations with the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
As for Russia's so-called power agencies -- which even
Chernomyrdin agrees to be Lebed's departments -- further
reshuffles among their leadership are unlikely, with only the
future of the Defense Ministry's top brass still unclear.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Yeltsin passed a decree making career KGB officer
Nikolai Kovalyov the fully-fledged director of the Federal
Security Service.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, Yeltsin's top aide
Viktor Ilyushin noted that changes would also be made to the
president's entourage. He explained that the president would need
a new staff capable of working efficiently under the emerging
conditions.
</P>
<P>
In this context, Ilyushin said Yeltsin had met a group of his
aides on Monday on possible personnel changes.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Posts Lowest Price Rise in Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's consumer prices rose by
3.3 percent in the first half of this year, the lowest growth rate
in five years, official statistics show.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the prices rose by 11.4 percent, according to a report
from the General Statistics Department (GSD).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vietnam also recorded the lowest inflation rate of
4.6 percent in years. And GSD analysts predict the 1996 inflation
rate will remain in single digital for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said the government should try to keep the
inflation rate in pace with the economic growth rate and remain
between 9 to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
They also said the government need to regulate money supply and
relax credit tightening.
</P>
<P>
In turn, the exchange rate between the Vietnamese Dong and hard
currencies should also be readjusted, the analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Life Allowance Granted for Veteran Mt. Everest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has
decided to grant a veteran Mount Everest climber, who has
conquered the world's highest peak for 10 times, a life-long
allowance of 5,000 rupees (90 US dollars) every month, according
to Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat.
</P>
<P>
While addressing the parliament Wednesday on the government's
budget plan for the new fiscal year from July 16, Mahat said he
had proposed the pension scheme for Ang Rita Sherpa as a sign of
respect to his skill and courage during his mountaineering career.
</P>
<P>
The 48-year-old Sherpa, nicknamed 'snow leopard', is known for
his unmatched climbing skills in local and international
mountaineering circles.
</P>
<P>
He rewrote a mountaineering record two months ago by reaching
the 8,848-meter-high summit of Mt. Everest for the 10th time
without using oxygen.
</P>
<P>
Sherpa will be the first climber in Nepal to receive government
pension in Nepal which has become a center of mountaineering
activities in the world with eight above-8,000-meter peaks and
more than 2,000 other peaks over 7,000 meters in its northern
Himalayan region.

WASHINGTON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Export-Import Bank
today approved the financing of 321 million U.S. dollars worth
sales of U.S. equipment and services for China's two power
projects.
</P>
<P>
The bank authorized the financing of the 58 million dollars
sale of six hydraulic turbines, accessories and services by Voith
Hydro Inc. of York for use in the Xiaolangdi multi-purpose dam
project on the Yellow River in Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
Voith won the bid after beating competition from France, Japan,
Norway, Switzerland, German and Canada. The U.S. bank will provide
a 55.8 million dollar direct loan for the project through the
Development Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
The bank also approved a financing to support the 263 million
sale of power plant equipment to China by a consortium of General
Electric Co. and other companies.
</P>
<P>
The consortium will provide equipment and services to Huaneng
Power International to build two 350-megawatt coal-fired
generating units for the phase II of the Nantong Power Plant
project in Jiangsu Province.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nepal Prepares Implementation of VAT Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government is to
implement a new value added tax (NAT) from mid-April 1997 in order
to simplify the country's tax system and increase national revenue
collection.
</P>
<P>
It was revealed Wednesday by Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat
in his budget report for the 1996-97 fiscal year to the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the existing sales tax and Excise Department
would be restructured into the Department of Value Added Tax in
the coming fiscal year starting from July 16.
</P>
<P>
However, the department will perform its current functions
relating to sales tax and excise until the VAT system is imposed,
according to Mahat.
</P>
<P>
Arrangements had been made to levy a single VAT rate of 15
percent to replace the prevailing two types of rates at present,
he said in the budget report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has decided to make some small
changes in the existing tax system by waiving sales tax for the
industries using domestic raw materials in their production and
raising excise duty on luxurious items like liquor and cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that the country would mobilize an additional
revenue of 1.8 billion rupees (30 million US dollars) through
these tax system improvements in the 1996-97 fiscal year.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Ross Perot said Wednesday he
will run again for president on the Reform Party ticket if
nominated.
</P>
<P>
"If the people want me to, certainly," he told CNN's "Larry
King Live."
</P>
<P>
Perot's remark came just a day after former Colorado Governor
Richard Lamm announced his candidacy for the Reform Party
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
Knowing that activists across the country were gathering
signatures to put his name in nomination, Perot said he was the
best person for the job.
</P>
<P>
As Perot built the Reform Party in the wake of his 1992
presidential run, he has repeatedly said that the party and its
principles are bigger than he is.
</P>
<P>
"This is not about me," he said when asked previously if he
would run.
</P>
<P>
But Perot said, as he did in 1992, he will respond if his
supporters want him on the ballot, although he did not say whether
he would campaign for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
Perot got 19 percent of the popular votes in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Reform Party is mailing a write-in survey to its members to
determine who will be listed on a nomination ballot at the party's
August 11 convention.
</P>
<P>
The survey is expected to reach close to 1 million of the 1.3
million people who have signed petitions to get the Reform Party
on state ballots this November.
</P>
<P>
So far, organizers have succeeded in getting the Reform Party
or a designated candidate certified for 21 state ballots.

<HEADLINE> Canada Calls U.S. Sanctions Ridiculous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian Government minister
today described as ridiculous United States action in launching
sanctions against a Canadian company doing business in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Canada's Sheritt International Corp. has been singled out by
the U.S. government as the first foreign company to be punished
under its Helms-Burton law.
</P>
<P>
Nine Sheritt executives and shareholders as well as their
spouses and children will be barred from the U.S. starting August
23, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) Television
reported tonight.
</P>
<P>
The Toronto-based mining company was being punished because it
had a nickel mine in Cuba, the CBC said.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Minister of International Trade, Art Eggleton,
said:"It is absolutely ridiculous for the United States to be
denying entry to people, particularly talking about children.
</P>
<P>
"Denying a couple of kids the opportunity to go to Disneyland
is not in any way related to their national security."
</P>
<P>
Despite the U.S. measure, Sheritt said today it had done
nothing illegal and it would continue to do business in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Sheritt vice-president Patrice Best said:"It will not deter
people from doing business there. There are a great deal of
opportunities."
</P>
<P>
The American Helms-Burton law is aimed at curbing foreign

in the Caribbean island country.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, senior executives and shareholders of companies
doing business with Cuba, can be denied entry to the United
States. U.S. citizens and companies can sue in U.S. courts
companies using properties confiscated by the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
Canada, along with Mexico and the European Union, has heavily
criticized the legislation.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, Canada has decided to amend its own
legislation, which would allow Canadians to counter-sue in
Canadian courts to recover damages awarded by U.S. courts under
the Helms-Burton law.
</P>
<P>
Canada also vowed to fight the U.S. law under the North

<HEADLINE> Teenager Crimes Shoot up in The Czech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Teenager Crimes have shot up in the
Czech Republic since 1993 reaching nearly 140,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
A senior police officer told a press conference today that they
constituted 32.4 percent of all crimes -- meaning that one in
every three criminals was under the age of 18.
</P>
<P>
Shoplifting and thieving of car parts topped juvenile
law-breaking in the central European country, followed by homicide
and rape.
</P>
<P>
The officer blamed the mass inflow of western violence and blue
movie-videos and similar books into the Republic since 1989 as a major
factor causing the sharp increase of teenager crime.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic had forbidden all TV stations around the
country to broadcast violent and blue movie-videos before 10
p.m. Recently a station which violated the rule was fined 1.3
million Czech korunas (about 48,000 U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Croatia, Poland to Boost Economic, Trade Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Croatia and Poland agreed today to
revitalize as soon as possible their trade ties which were
battered by the prolonged war in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during talks between Polish Prime
Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz and his visiting Croatian
counterpart, Zlatko Matesa, who arrived here on Tuesday on his
first visit.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that great efforts should be made by both sides to
restore the trade volume between the two countries to the level of
1989, two years before Croatia's declaration of independence from
the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
They both emphasized the importance of signing an accord on
free trade between the two countries as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the two countries had great potential in
maintaining broad cooperation in the economy, particularly in the
shipbuilding and power industries.
</P>
<P>
Matesa, whose two-day visit ended today, thanked Poland for its
efforts in resolving the nearly-four-years-long ethnic conflict in
the former Yugoslavia, including its dispatch of peacekeepers to
the area.
</P>
<P>
Cimoszewicz said Poland would support Croatia's bid to join the
Central European Free Trade Zone and would help in the country's
reconstruction work.
</P>
<P>
A bitter conflict broke out in Croatia in late 1991 when its
Serb minority revolted against the country's independence from the
former Yugoslavia. The war was stopped in early 1992 after the
United Nations stepped in and sent thousands of peacekeepers to
separate the warring sides.
</P>
<P>
But it erupted again in 1995 as Croatian troops staged a
massive offensive to recover territory held by the rebel
Serbs. Croatia retook most of the Serb-held land during the
offensive and the war officially ended last November when the
Dayton peace accord was signed.
</P>
<P>
The peace accord provides for a peaceful reintegration of the
last rebel Serb enclave into Croatia.

<HEADLINE> Thai Exports Up 7.1 Percent in First Five Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports in the first
five months rose only 7.1 percent over the same period of last
year, much lower than the 18 percent target set for the year,
according to Commerce Minister Chucheep Harnsawat.
</P>
<P>
Based on Customs Department information, imports during the
said five months were worth 778.3 billion baht (31.13 billion US
dollars), up 12.16 percent from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
With exports worth 586.8 billion baht (23.47 billion dollars),
the country's trade deficit for the five months was 191.5 billion
baht (7.66 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The figures released by the commerce minister are at variance
with those published by the Central Bank, which reported an 11
percent export growth in the first five months this year.
</P>
<P>
Items with a higher export value this year included computers
and parts, integrated circuits, television sets and parts, air
conditioners, gems and jewelry, furniture, leather products,
canned seafood, rubber, sugar, rice, and tapioca pellet.
</P>
<P>
Among poor export earners were garments, shoes and parts,
plastic products and video recorders.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the less-than-expected export growth during the
first five months, the government has readjusted the export growth
target from 18 percent to 14 percent for this year.

Banharn urged the private sector to help push economic progress

Although over the past 30 years Thailand's economic growth has
been impressive, development has been centralized in Bangkok and
nearby provinces, resulting in an influx of migrant labor to the
capital, traffic congestion and other social problems, while
remote rural provinces remaining underdeveloped and impoverished.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Australia's unemployment rate
dropped to 8.3 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis in June from
8.5 percent in May, according to figures released here today by
the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).
</P>
<P>
The country's total employment figure rose by 8,700, or 0.1
percent, to 8.33 million in June from 8.32 million in May, the ABS
said.
</P>
<P>
The figures boosted the local financial market immediately
after their release this morning. The Australian dollar
strengthened to 79.75 US cents from 79.70 US cents and the futures
market in Sydney also went higher.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate in June fell back to the level of one year ago
while a less proportion of the population remained in the labor
force than in June last year.
</P>
<P>
The participation rate, or the proportion of working-age people
who either have or are seeking a job, remained basically unchanged
from the previous month at 63.4 percent in June. But it was lower
than the 63.8 percent one year ago.
</P>
<P>
The ABS figures were in accordance with the Treasury's latest
economy forecast, which predicted that the unemployment rate would
fall further in the latter half of the year but that the inflation
rate would be capped.
</P>
<P>
However, the ABS figures ran contradictory to the statistics
released today by the Australian Department of Social Security,
which showed that 2,500 more people joined the jobless group
receiving government doles in June.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that in the general picture, Australia's
labor market showed signs of a steady recovery. According to ABS
figures, the country's employment improved by 3,300 in trend terms
in June over May, while the unemployment rate stabilized at 8.6
percent.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Withdraws Open Shipping Market Offers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has decided to withdraw
offers to open up its shipping markets to foreign companies under
the World Trade Organization (WTO), a business economics
department source said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai decision was made following the deadlock of WTO
negotiations on the liberalization of maritime transport.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of the offers would not mean a freeze on future
foreign access to Thai shipping markets, which include both
on-shore handling and sea transport, Bangkok Post today quotes the
source as saying.
</P>
<P>
Neither does it mean that Thailand is no longer prepared to
convert its liberalization measures into commitment under the WTO.
</P>
<P>
It means that basic WTO principles, such as the absence of
discrimination between countries, would not have to be applied to
the shipping sector, the Post said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai offers would have committed Thailand to allow foreign
companies access to international passenger and goods services,
international towing, and various support services including
freight forwarding, but with some exceptions.
</P>
<P>
A last-ditch attempt to rescue the world shipping talks failed
last month when the U.S. refused to submit an offer even though 24
of the 42 countries and regions participating in the talks had
improved their liberalization offers.
</P>
<P>
It was decided in late June in Geneva that new negotiations
would not be held until the year 2000, meaning that a shipping
agreement might not be reached before 2005.

Myanmar's port handling capacity in face of the growing demand,
the official New Light of Myanmar reported today.

about 12,000 tons of cargo a month, is expected to generate some
20,000 tons a month in the future, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The MPA has been carrying out development projects at Thilawa
to supplement the capacity of Yangon port since June 1995 in

<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Some transportation cooperatives
in Nicaragua today joined in the general strike launched by the
transportation operators on Tuesday demanding an indefinite tax
exemption.
</P>
<P>
They accused the government of being intransigent because Labor
Minister Francisco Rosales had rebuked as "electoral rhetoric as
well as absurd" a draft legislation which proposed an indefinite
tax exemption for transportation cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
The minister insisted that the cooperatives be granted tax
exemptions for short periods only but never on an indefinite basis.
</P>
<P>
The strike, being staged by freight and passenger
transportation operators, was later joined by urban and
inter-urban mass transportation cooperatives from Masaya, Granada,
Matagalpa, Carazo and other places.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly was sieged on Wednesday by dozens of
transportation vehicles including minivans that came to reinforce
the sit-in taxi operators there.
</P>
<P>
The freight and mass transportation cooperatives in Managua had
asked the government to extend the present seven-year tax
exemption to an indefinite period. They vowed to continue the
strike until their demand is met.
</P>
<P>
This is the fifth national transportation strike since
President Violeta Chamorro took office in April, 1990. Several
deaths and huge property damage were reported during the previous
labor unrests.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The press in China's leading
financial center and biggest industrial city have turned out to be
sound investment advisors for the citizens of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
With the increase in individual incomes, the city's residents
have begun to take an interest in 'investing', something that has
become a household word in the city.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that the stock market attracted some 7
million Shanghai citizens by the end of last year, and Shanghai
Securities, China's first securities newspaper, is one of the most
widely read in the city.
</P>
<P>
Even local newspapers, such as The Liberation Daily and Xinmin
Evening News are carrying daily stock quotations, while local
television stations feature financial and economic news, with
stock indexes and prices, on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
Not to be outdone, radio stations give stock quotations every
other hour and invite financial experts to provide daily analyses
for traders after the closing of the market.
</P>
<P>
While all this is going on, collecting commemorative gold and
silver coins, works of art, and stamps, which can be an
investment, are also quite popular among Shanghai's citizens.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's Business News runs a weekly column "Today's Stamp
Market", not only describing new stamps, but also offering
information on collecting art and other investment items, such as
a new variety of magnetic telephone card, or commemorative gold or
silver coins issued in limited amounts.
</P>
<P>
Ma Dongcheng, an office employee, bought two paper fans with
inscriptions by famous calligraphers for several thousand yuan,
two years ago, at an auction fair. The price of these treasures
has gone up by about 70 percent. He had learned from newspapers
previously that works of art can be a kind of low-risk investment.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that for people who do not have much money
and much time to play the stock exchange, collecting works of art
can be one of the best ways to make an investment.

<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- A young Party official, seriously
wounded by gunshot while fighting a gang of thieves in north
China's Shanxi province, has been hailed as a local hero.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of local residents in Yuncheng City have flocked to
32-year-old Feng Yanghe's home to praise him for his courage. Feng
is a cadre working in the Communist Party Disciplinary Inspection
Committee of Yuncheng Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
He was also named provincial "model of daring to fight for
justice."
</P>
<P>
He was returning to his office from a business outing on May 22
when he heard people on his bus shouting "stop thieves, help!" and
he saw four people smashing the bus door and fleeing.
</P>
<P>
Feng quickly followed the four and intercepted them. One
gangster drew a dagger and attempted to stab him. Feng kicked the
hand of the gangster, making the attacker lose the grasp of the
knife, and hit him a severe blow, knocking him sprawling on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
The other three all attacked Feng, and during a ten minute
fierce fight one took out a home-made shotgun and fired at Feng's
head. The gang of thieves ran away by robbing a car, leaving Feng
lying in a pool of blood.
</P>
<P>
Feng was later rescued by passengers from the bus which rushed
him to a hospital. Local authorities sent representatives to
visit Feng immediately and demanded no efforts to be spared to
save him. They ordered public security departments to deploy
forces quickly in pursuit of the criminals.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Rare Relics Survive in Robbed Tomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The largest Tang dynasty stone
coffin ever found in China has been discovered in a secret burial
chamber here in Xi'an, the ancient capital of several Chinese
dynasties.
</P>
<P>
Two other chambers had been looted over centuries by grave
robbers - but they missed the hidden tomb, according local
archaeologists.
</P>
<P>
More than 140 exquisite tri-colored pottery figurines, and the
large carved stone coffin from the Tang Dynasty (618-907) have
been found intact in the robbed tomb.
</P>
<P>
The tomb is located in Gaoling county, 20 km north of Xi'an,
capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province. It belonged to Li
Hui, minister of justice of the Tang Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Close to the Weihe River, way leading to the tomb and wall
paintings had been washed away by water. The front and back
chambers of the tomb, and a passage connecting the chambers were
empty because of repeated robberies over the past few centuries.
</P>
<P>
To the surprise of archaeologists who went to the tomb
recently, a hidden chamber was found close to the the front and
back chambers.
</P>
<P>
A passage, 11.6 meters to the west from the pass and turning
north for another 20 meters, led to the mystery chamber.
</P>
<P>
A four-meter long, three-meter wide and two-meter high outer
coffin was found in the chamber. Designs of ladies, officials, and
flowers were carved on the stone coffin.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the stone coffin is the largest Tang Dynasty
(618-907) coffin ever found in the country.
</P>
<P>
Beside the coffin were some 160 burial articles, including 139
tri-color pottery figurines.
</P>
<P>
From the gravestone,the archaeologists established that the
tomb belonged to Li Hui, Minister of Justice of the Tang Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
According to historical documents, the emperor of Tang once
said that he, and the people around him, would be unhappy if they
could not see Li Hui for one day.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that perhaps that is why the tomb structure of Li's
tomb is so special, and some of the burial articles were able to
survive attacks by grave robbers.

<HEADLINE> EU to Give Bulgaria Big Aid to Boost Nuclear Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) agreed today
to give Bulgaria 7 million ECU (9 million U.S. dollars) in loan to
help boost the safety at the country's nuclear power plant.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to finance the work of Bulgaria's
Committee on Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy and cooperation between
the Bulgarian Kozlodui nuclear power station and its counterparts
in west European countries.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum was signed here by Atanas Paparizov, Bulgaria's
minister in charge of trade and foreign economic cooperation, and
O'Salivan, EU ambassador to Sofia.
</P>
<P>
O'Salivan told reporters that the new loan approved for
Bulgaria was part of the so-called Phare Program, under which
Bulgaria has received nearly 1 billion dollars in loans from the
EU over the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Kozlodui, which was built in northwestern Bulgaria 22 years ago
with the help of the former Soviet Union, is the country's sole
nuclear power plant but has the largest annual generating capacity
in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Western countries have expressed deep concern over the safety
at the ageing Kozlodui and other nuclear power plants in eastern
Europe and the former Soviet republics, most of which were built
with Soviet technology now widely considered outdated by current
international standards.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria has shut down some of the generating sets in Kozlodui
for safety tests in recent months with the help of the EU.

RIO DE JANEIRO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian government is
worried about the the rapidly aging population of the country
which has swollen by 700 percent in 26 years.
</P>
<P>
There are now seven million elders in the country.
</P>
<P>
At the 48th annual meeting of the Brazilian Society for
Progress and Science, in Sao Paulo, the government sounded alarm
that the aged, Brazilians over 65 years old, will number 9 million
at the end of the century and 16 million by the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
The largest number will be women, who number 100 to every 83
men.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was told that Brazil, with the world's sixth
largest population of 153 million, would approach same ratio of
aged as in developed European countries by the year 2025.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that the increasing aged population was
occuring despite a slowing-down in the overall population growth rate
which fell from 3 percent a year between 1940-60 to 1.9 percent in
1991.

<HEADLINE> Nicaraguan Presidential Candidates Likely to Face </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The key presidential candidates in
Nicaragua will have to face a run-off after they fail to net
enough votes in the October 20 general elections, says a poll.
</P>
<P>
According to the electoral law, a second round of votes will be
held on November 24 or December 1 if none of the candidates obtain
at least 45 percent of the valid votes during the first round.
</P>
<P>
The Cid-Gallup poll, carried out between June 26-July 2 and
published on Wednesday by the "La Tribuna" newspaper, showed that
if the elections were held today, Liberal Alliance presidential
candidate Arnoldo Aleman, the former mayor of Managua, would rank
first with only 36 percent of the votes in the electoral
preference.
</P>
<P>
Former Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega of the Sandinista
National Liberation Front (FSLN in Spanish) would come second with
26 percent.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the former survey, Aleman advanced 3 percentage
points in the electoral preference while Ortega gained 5
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said that the increase in the votes for the
two strongest candidates was due to the failure of several parties
to form an alliance as a third force.
</P>
<P>
Last week the Supreme Electoral Council disqualified
presidential candidates Antonio Lacayo of the National Project,
Eden Pastora of the Democratic Action Party and Alvaro Robelo of
the Nicaraguan Alliance which was dissolved at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Analysts pointed out that Aleman and Ortega would not see any
further improvement in voters preference since the former was seen
as a continuation of the Somocista government and the latter as a
return to the former Sandinista regime.

WUHAN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei Province has
enjoyed a 47.35 percent increase in output of its township
enterprises, amounting to 63.7 billion yuan in the first five
months of the year.
</P>
<P>
The province will find ways, over the next five years, of
spurring growth in the enterprises, which play a key role in
farmers' incomes.
</P>
<P>
Total output value of township enterprises in the province is
expected to hit 670 billion yuan during the 1996-2000 period,
according to provincial authorities.
</P>
<P>
The methods to be taken include increasing bank lending,
concentrating funds in high-tech projects, increasing exportable
products, supporting firms that have a good track record, and
encouraging enterprise groups.
</P>
<P>
Those enterprises processing agricultural by-products will get
government support for both project approval and for funding,
while those offering services for agricultural production will be
exempt from income tax.
</P>
<P>
The province is one of China's major automobile producers, and
township industries there have grown rapidly in the 1990s, and had

BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- China has ordered 15 unqualified
education centers across the country to stop issuing doctorate
degrees, China Education Daily reports. The units were also
ordered to halt recruiting and enrolling of new students.
</P>
<P>
A team of experts have spent nearly half a year carrying out
inspections and assessing the work of 259 units covering the
fields of maths, chemistry, mechanics, electrotechnics and
computer sciences.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that 244 units, or 94.2 percent, are qualified
in teaching, management and scientific research.
</P>
<P>
According to the inspection, major factors existing in the
unqualified units include the laxity in subject construction and
scientific research, shortage of experienced tutors, and few
technological fruits.
</P>
<P>
A complete academic system has been formed in China within the
past 15 years, an official with the Academic Degrees Committee
under the State Council said. He added that a group of units are
authorized to award academic degrees.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the emphasis in the future should be

The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- The prime minister's plans for the national gun control
legislation were thrown into doubt Wednesday when the governments
of Queensland and Northern Territory challenged his decision.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- The Audit Commission warned that the Howard government's

middle-class welfare boom which Australia cannot afford without
increased taxation.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>

The Australian Financial Review

<P>
-- The Australian Council of Trade Unions has warned that there

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Borders Could Be Reopen Under Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu indicated today that he would like to reopen Israel's
West Bank and Gaza borders to let Palestinians resume work in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
But he told the ABC television program "Good Morning America"
in an interview that the reopening can take place only when he is
satisfied that Palestinian leaders are doing all they can do to
prevent attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
The border closure was implemented most recently earlier this
year by the Israeli Labor government after a spate of guerrilla
bombings, which has prevented thousands of Palestinians from
going to Israel to work.
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe in unnecessary hardships for the Palestinian
population.... What I would do is, if the Palestinian Authority
keeps its commitments on a permanent basis, on a serious basis,
to prevent terrorist attacks against us from their domains, then
I will certainly ease up on the closure," he said.
</P>
<P>
He told the ABC program that he would like to undergird the
peace process with economic prosperity for the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"My policy toward the Palestinians would be one of economic
cooperation," he added.

<P>
LONDON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- This year's Wimbledon tennis
championships attracted the highest number of spectators for
three years, according to the tournament officials.
</P>
<P>
The total attendance of 385,042 was an increase of 160 on 1995
but the figure was significantly boosted by the spillover day on
Monday when the rain-delayed closing rounds of the doubles were
played and 13,518 people were let in free.
</P>
<P>
Christopher Gorringe, chief executive of the All-England Club,
said: "Considering we were badly affected by the weather on no
fewer than five days, suffered three Tube (underground) strikes,
had to contend with Euro 96 and lost a good few of our star
players in the early stages, I am more than pleased with the final
crowd figures."

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Move Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Share prices at the New York
Stock Exchange managed to move higher today at the prompt of more
buyers which made blue chips to finish higher.
</P>
<P>
But weak technology shares and uncertainty about the future of
the economy kept the broader market mixed.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been down nearly 50
points, turned around in the last hour of trading.
</P>
<P>
The Dow closed 21.79 points higher at 5,603.65, but declining
issues still outnumbered advancers on the New York Stock Exchange
by a margin of 4-to-3. The total volume increased to 421.31
million shares from 379.19 million Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index gained 0.18 to 351.75. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.31 to 656.06.
</P>
<P>
But, the technology-rich Nasdaq composite index lost 15.44
points to 1,138.15 while the American Stock Exchange market value
index fell 4.86 to 561.81.
</P>
<P>
Today's early declines were triggered by Motorola, the big
semiconductor and telecommunications company, which reported
Tuesday evening that its second-quarter profits were far short of
analyst estimates, falling 32 percent. Motorola partly blamed
slack demand for semiconductors.
</P>
<P>
The earnings shortfall erased any optimism generated by the
semiconductor industry's monthly book-to-bill report for June,
which showed the third straight increase in the ratio between new
orders and previous orders that were billed.

<HEADLINE> Mitterrand Angered by "Rainbow Warrior" Bombing: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Late French President Francois
Mitterrand once described the sinking of Rainbow Warrior by
French secret agents in July 1985 as "an intolerable crime" and
"an unforgivable stupidity."
</P>
<P>
According to a previously unknown interview he gave to a
journalist in August 1995, French secret agents sank on July 10,
1985 Rainbow Warrior, a vessel of the Green Peace movement,
outside the port of Auckland, New Zealand, to silence its protest
against French nuclear tests in the South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The interview Mitterrand had with journalist Patrick Amory at
his private residence in Latche, Landes, five months before his
death was published by the Paris-Match periodical in its Thursday
edition.
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand told Amory, "I have made two definite points, which
are the continuation of nuclear tests... and a request asking our
military not to intervene against our policy in the Pacific."
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, the military act like idiot.... In some countries,
the supreme head of state knows every detail of the activities of
the secret services in their countries. I never love to enter such
details. Between being guilty and being imbecile, I have chosen
(the latter)," said Mitterrand.
</P>
<P>
"I have never ordered the sinking of this boat or another....
The operation messed up things completely.... I will never take
any responsibility for what I think to be an intolerable crime and
an unforgivable stupidity at the same time," he said.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Show Some Conciliation to Quell Fears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu today assured the U.S. Congress of the conciliatory side
of his foreign policies in an attempt to quell American fears that
his Likud government might slow the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Still, he made no specific proposals towards the final
settlement of the Middle East peace process in his 35-minute
Congress speech.
</P>
<P>
He told the members of Congress and diplomatic guests that
Israel's hand "is stretched out in peace for all who would grasp
in."
</P>
<P>
"Israel is ready to resume negotiations with the Palestinian
Authority on the implementation of our interim agreement.... We
are ready to engage Syria and Lebanon on meaningful negotiations.
We want a peace that will last," he said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, however, returned to his old theme that peace would
have to be based on "security for all," indicating the governing
Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Gaza should prevent
attacks against Israel or peace could be halted and curbed.
</P>
<P>
"Peace means the absence of violence.... Peace without personal
safety is a contradiction in term," he said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu outlined three "pillars" that were necessary for
peace negotiations to proceed, which include "security" for Israel
against terrorist attack; "reciprocity" in which all disputes are
peacefully negotiated; and "democracy and human rights" in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Arab officials, responding to some of Netanyahu's comments,
said that peace will not be achieved without Israel returning all
occupied land. The secretary general of the Arab League and Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa both urged Netanyahu to back
away from his tough policy pronouncements.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Athletes Evacuate Hurricane-Threaterned Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 Olympic
athletes and staff members were being evacuated from the yachting
venue off the Georgia coast Wednesday as Hurricane Bertha was
heading for the southeastern coast of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Olympic officials said the athletes and staff members were
voluntarily leaving the marina at Wilmington Island, while other
residents of Georgia's barrier islands were poised for mandatory
evacuation.
</P>
<P>
About 35 sailboats, two keel boat classes and one catamaran
class, were being shipped to the main Olympic Marina site in
Savannah, The United Press International said, quoting Olympic
Games spokesman Marcus Hutchinson. About 165 smaller boats would
be left at the marina.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic athletes and staff members would hole up at the
Olympic Village and other accomodations in Savannah.
</P>
<P>
Hutchinson said that tents were being taken down and all
technology, computers, data bases are being removed from the site.
</P>
<P>
Hurricane Bertha, growing up in the Caribbean region, arrived
Bahamas Tuesday. The winds increased to 115 mph early Wednesday,
making it a Category 3 storm capable of extensive damage.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. National Weather Service has issued a hurricane watch
for the coast of Carolina and part of Georgia, fearing that Bertha
would approch the region on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
More than 50,000 residents and tourists on the barrier islands
in North Carolina began to evacuate Wednesday and emergency
officials in South Carolina also urged residents to leave coastal
Beaufort County.
</P>
<P>
The Hurricane brushed by Puerto Rico on Monday, then the Turks
and Caicos Tuesday. Three people were killed in storm-related
accidents in Puerto Rico and one in the Virgin Islands. Also in
Pueerto Rico, Coast Guard reported that a boat with as many as 42
people aboard was crippled Monday and passengers were jumping into
the water.

mujahidin force in Western Europe, said Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper reported in a leading story in its
Thursday's edition that through investigations on the
assassination of Sheikh Sahraoui on July 11, 1995, French police
have been able to put into light several international Islamists'
networks in France and other Western European countries.
</P>
<P>
The report said that French police have in the past year
dismantled several terrorist networks in the Paris area and in
Lille, and have put some of its members in jail.
</P>
<P>
Through questioning the Islamic militants, French security
forces have found one common background of these militants: all of
them have undergone trainings in camps in Pakistan and
Afghanistan, and many of them have fought alongside their Muslim
brothers in Bosnia, said the Le Monde report written by Erich
Inciyan.
</P>
<P>
For instance, Rachid Ramda, one of the leaders of Algeria's
extremist Islamic Army Group (GIA) who is being extradited to
France for terrorist activities from England, is one of the
pioneers in organizing a guerilla training camp in Peshawar at the
Pakistani-Afghan border.
</P>
<P>
He has also helped organize military training of Bosnian
Muslims in Bosnia, said the report, which said that "an Islamic
international" might already have come into existence.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic terrorists made a series of bombing attacks against
French targets, including the Lyon-Paris TGV bullet train in
August 1995, the Paris Metro subway train in October and the RER
long-distance train in Paris in July.
</P>
<P>
French police believe the attack was made by the militants to
revenge themselves on the killing of some hijackers by French
troops in December 1994 at the Marseille-Marignane international
airport, and the GIA is believed to be masterminding the attack.
</P>
<P>
"Today,the main channels of violent and radical Islamists
capable of threatening Western Europe pass through Pakistan and
Peshawar," Le Monde quoted a French magistrate specialized in
anti-terrorist affairs as saying.
</P>
<P>
Since December 1995, Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere has been
heading an anti-terrorist organ called "Territory Watch" which is
responsible for investigating Islamic youths who return to France
from Pakistan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
According to the result of some preliminary investigations made
by Bruguiere, some militants are now fighting in Afghanistan,
Algeria and Bosnia, but some of them have returned to Western
Europe and are waiting for "effective mobilization," said the
report.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Increasingly Being Appreciated in World, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Prime Minister Radoje
Kontic said today his country is increasingly being appreciated in
Europe and the world for its contribution to the reaching and
application of the peace agreement for Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Kontic positively assessed the attending
of a Yugoslav delegation he headed of the recent summit of central
and eastern European countries in Salzburg, Austria.
</P>
<P>
"The summit often said Yugoslavia was the guarantor of security
in the territory of southeastern Europe," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia is one of the three signatories of the Dayton
agreement which was signed in December last year to end the bloody
Bosnia civil war.
</P>
<P>
The summit also expressed expectations that in the coming
period Yugoslavia would play a key role in strengthening peace and
stability in the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that at the summit, attended by more
than 10 heads of state and government, many participants agreed
that it was important for them to support Yugoslavia's return into
international political and financial institutions and its
participation in sub-regional and regional cooperation in Europe,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia has successfully resumed diplomatic relations with
many European countries, but it has not been readmitted into the
United Nations and many other international financial institutions
as the issue of rump Yugoslavia's status in the U.N. has not been
solved.
</P>
<P>
Kontic said the summit agreed that the sanctions should fully
be lifted, especially their "outer wall" since this could prevent
Yugoslavia from being a factor of peace and stability in the
Balkans, as the international community expects.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council suspended the
three-and-half-year-long sanctions against Yugoslavia in December
1995, but the total lift of the sanctions would not be realized
until elections in Bosnia were held in September as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
According to Kontic, businessmen from central and eastern
European countries, as well as those from the West, have shown
great interest in cooperation with Yugoslavia in the economic
field.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia is much interested in normalizing relations with the
European Union "in a positive and pragmatic manner," he said.

<HEADLINE> China-Hong Kong: Bridging Transition Seminar Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Commissioner to London
Sir David Ford said here today that Hong Kong will keep its
prosperity and development after Hong Kong's reversion from
Britain to China on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Sir Ford made the remarks at a seminar entitled "China-Hong
Kong: Bridging The Transition" co-sponsored by the London Chamber
of Commerce and Industry and the Hong Kong Trade Development
Council.
</P>
<P>
Sir Ford said to keep Hong Kong's prosperity and continuous
development is the common desire of Britain and China. Having
dissolved the fear and misunderstanding about Hong Kong's
reversion from British to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997, Hong Kong
is attracting more and more people and investment from all over
the world, especially from America, Japan and European countries,
he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said that by the time of Hong Kong's sovereignty
reversion from Britain to China, 75 billion U.S. dollars of
foreign reserves would be left there.
</P>
<P>
Sir Peter Cazalet, president of the China-Britain Trade Group,
also made a speech at the seminar. He stressed the great impact of
China's Ninth Five Year Plan on business, saying, "It will provide
enormous opportunities for the British investors."
</P>
<P>
Sino-British relations have turned friendly since Deputy Prime
Minister Heseltine visited China last May. Sir Cazalet believed
that "the momentum of the good relations between Britain and China
would exceed 1997."
</P>
<P>
More than 100 representatives from British government finance
and business circles attended the seminar.

<HEADLINE> Passengers, Cargo Decline on Lake Victoria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Marine transportation on Lake
Victoria including passengers and cargo has declined since May
this year when a Tanzanian vessel capsized in the lake, killing
about 500 people.
</P>
<P>
Sources from Port Bell Pier near Kampala disclosed here today
that passenger and cargo traffic at the ports of Bell and Mwanza,
Tanzania, has drastically gone down.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the sources said, the number of passengers going
through Port Bell to Mwanza has dropped to zero.
</P>
<P>
The data from Port Bell Pier booking office indicate that
loose cargo including bicycles and spare parts, cotton seed cakes
and others from Mwanza to Port Bell averaged 50 tons per month
from the beginning of last year to May this year.
</P>
<P>
Loose cargo from Port Bell to Mwanza averaged 10 tons a month
during the same period, the data said, adding that the goods
included polythene bags, water melons, curry powder, passion
fruits, etc.
</P>
<P>
By June 20, the sources said, the last cargo to leave Port
Bell for Mwanza weighed an average of 18 tons.
</P>
<P>
From then on, there has been no more recording, due to the
catastrophe that hit marine transportation by the capsizing of
the Tanzanian vessel, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The numbers of passengers by marine transport on Lake Victoria
from Mwanza to Port Bell were 14,591 in l995 and the first five
months of l996 while those from Port Bell to Mwanza were 7,450 in
the same period, the sources said, adding the figure has now
dropped to zero.

<HEADLINE> Mostar Croats Threaten to Reject Elections Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A leader of the Bosnian Croats in
Mostar said today that Croats may reject results of the local
elections to protest against what they called "irregularities."
</P>
<P>
Mile Puljic, president of the Mostar branch of the Croatian
Democratic Union (HDZ) in Bosnia-Herzegovina, made the comment
following a request by the head of the city's election committee
to te EU administration to release the election results by degree.
</P>
<P>
Rauf Zaimovic, president of the election committee, asked the
EU administration to do so because releasing the results by the
committee itself has been blocked by its Croat members.
</P>
<P>
Croats have complained that there were "irregularities" in
oversea polling stations, where the majority of votes have gone to
the HDZ' main opponent, the Muslim-led Party of Democratic Action.
</P>
<P>
Puljic said, "The Croat side in Mostar would not accept results
of the local elections, should the EU administration in Mostar
publicize them by decree."
</P>
<P>
He claimed that such a move by the EU administration would lead
it into "the abyss of lawlessness" and increase "legal insecurity
in historic Bosnian elections scheduled for September."

<HEADLINE> Arkansas Banker Denies Whitewater Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- An Arkansas banker today denied
charges by Whitewater prosecutors that he diverted money from his
bank into Bill Clinton's campaign coffers.
</P>
<P>
Herby Branscum Jr. told a federal court jury in Arkansas that
he had been a longtime Clinton supporter and had held numerous
state government positions. But he denied any quid pro quo, The
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Branscum said he was "absolutely not" guilty of any of the
charges contained in the indictment against him, in response to a
question by his lawyer, Dan Guthrie.
</P>
<P>
Branscum and Robert M. Hill, co-owners of Perry County Bank of
Perryville, Ark., are charged with conspiring to use their bank's
money to reimburse contributions by themselves and others to
Clinton and other Arkansas politicians.
</P>
<P>
They also are charged with concealing from the Internal Revenue
Service 52,500 dollars in cash withdrawals by the Clinton
campaign in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution presented evidence that Branscum was appointed
state highway commissioner in January 1991, five weeks after Hill
personally delivered some 15,000 dollars in campaign contributions
to Clinton. The prosecution has made no allegation that the
appointment was illegal.
</P>
<P>
Branscum said he had served in numerous state government
positions beginning with a 1974 appointment to the Arkansas Claims
Commission, which resolves claims against the state government.
</P>
<P>
Branscum became Arkansas Democratic chairman in 1976 and four
years later, Clinton appointed him to a second term on the
commission. In 1982, Clinton offered him the chairmanship of the
influential Arkansas Public Service Commission, which regulates
utilities, the banker testified. But he said he turned down the job
because he didn't want to give up his law practice.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's videotaped testimony for the trial was taken Sunday
at the White House, but Guthrie said he did not expect to play the
tape for the jury. Instead, jurors likely will see an edited
version of Clinton's taping, his second in a Whitewater-related
trial.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Debt, Food Security Addressed by OAU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 6 (Xinhua) -- African leaders today agreed to
take common stance on the issues of foreign debt and food
security in the two economic resolutions adopted by the 32nd
Summit of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
The resolution on foreign debt announced the establishment of
an OAU contact group to coordinate among the member states over
the debt issue.
</P>
<P>
Africa's outstanding foreign debt rose by 18 billion US
Dollars to the historical high of 320 billion Dollars at the end
of 1995, accounting for 80 percent of Africa's total Gross
Domestic Product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
That means if the debt burden is now shared equally among the
continent's estimated 680 million people, each African would have
to pay some 470 dollars, an amount which outstrips the average
per-capita annual income in the continent.
</P>
<P>
And during the recent years, 30 percent of Africa's foreign
currency income was used to service its foreign debt annually.
</P>
<P>
"It will continue to be the most serious single bottleneck of
Africa's economic breakthrough until there is a lasting solution
to the problem of Africa's debt," said OAU Secretary General
Salim A. Salim.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also highlighted the need for an effective
coordination, consultation and exchange of information and
experience among the African countries.
</P>
<P>
The resolution on food security said African leaders will take
a common stance in the forthcoming world food summit to protect
themselves from being further exploited by the unfair
international trade system.
</P>
<P>
In a world where 800 million people do not have adequate
access to food including 200 million children below the age of
five, Africa is the continent with the most serious problems.
</P>
<P>
"It is the only continent where agricultural production per
capita has been declining over the past 20 years," said the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
Africa is faced this year with an additional 1.2 billion US
dollar bill for cereal imports, with its cereal stocks having
gone down to four percent below the security threshold, leading
to price increases of 40 to 50 percent, according to a report
released by the World Food Program. enditem

<HEADLINE> TV Set Can Be Linked to Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Families who now do not own
personal computers may soon use their TV to surf the Internet.
</P>
<P>
A new company in California has created a low-cost device to
enable TV sets to browse the Internet's World Wide Web, an idea
computer industry veterans have talked for months but not
realized.
</P>
<P>
WebTV Networks Inc., a Silicon Valley startup firm, planned to
demonstrate its device publicly for the first time today and
announce two powerful partners.
</P>
<P>
The potential market is huge: 100 million U.S. households have
TVs. Two-thirds of those don't have PCs and many of those can't
afford them, said a press report here today.
</P>
<P>
Sony Electronics Inc. and Philips Consumer Electronics Co. will
produce and sell machines based on WebTV's technology in
September, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Nearly a dozen companies, including large ones like Oracle
Corp. and IBM, have talked about lower-cost Internet access
devices in recent months.
</P>
<P>
WebTV Networks kept quiet, working with Sony and Philips for
months and building their trust by adhering to design deadlines.
</P>
<P>
WebTV's machine uses a phone line and universal remote control
to navigate the worldwide computer network. Logging on is as
simple as pushing a green button marked "Web" on the remote. A
wireless keyboard is optional.
</P>
<P>
Through clever programming, the company has overcome a major
hurdle by making Web pages look good on a TV screen, which portrays
images with less resolution than most computer monitors.

<HEADLINE> Britain Offers South Africa $93-Million Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
told visiting South African President Nelson Mandela here today
that the British government is to grant South Africa 60 million
pounds (93 million U.S. dollars) of aid.
</P>
<P>
Major, who made the pledge during a meeting with President
Mandela earlier today at the Downing Street, said that the aid was
targeted particularly at improving standards of education in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
"This pledge maintains the British government's support for the
political and economic transition of South Africa," Major said in
an official statement.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the aid will be used to promote development
in priority sectors agreed by the two governments: education, good
governance, health, rural development and the development of small
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"This new pledge of aid will continue work in the focus sectors
with particular emphasis on education," Major said.
</P>
<P>
"This is an area in which President Mandela takes a
particularly close interest and where he is determined to shift
the balance of resources to previously disadvantaged communities,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, President Mandela, who arrived here Tuesday for
his first state visit to Britain, received eight honorary degrees
at a presentation ceremony at the Buckingham Palace.
</P>
<P>
During the four-day visit, President Mandela is expected to
address a joint session of the British parliament and hold talks
with officials of the Bank of England and the Confederation of
British Industry to discuss further investment in South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Envoy on Helicopter Attack Incident in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A visiting Turkish envoy today said
he would try his best to persuade the Turkish government that a
technical commission should be formed to probe the recent Turkish
helicopter attack incident in an Iranian border area.
</P>
<P>
Erol Caker, Turkish deputy interior minister, said at a press
conference here following his three-day talks with Iranian
officials that Turkey has the Kurdish problem and there was an
exchange of fire between Turkish forces and rebels from the
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in the area along the Turkish-Iranian
border line.
</P>
<P>
The border incident killed six Iranians and wounded 15 others
in West Azarbaijan on June 26.
</P>
<P>
He said there was nothing wrong in the relations between
Turkey and Iran. The two neighbors enjoy stability in the common
border regions.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said at a meeting
with the Turkish official that the Turkish government should tell
its border officials to be more cautious and pay enough attention
to the Iranian border areas so as to prevent any incident which
might create doubts and suspicions.
</P>
<P>
He said such incidents are not in the interests of Turkey and
that preserving border security needs a mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said that it was part of Iran's decisive policies to
defend the security of the Islamic homeland and the safety of its
citizens.
</P>
<P>
But, Caker replied that his country follows the policy of
non-intervention in the internal affairs of other countries, and
voiced the willingness of his government in preserving good
neighborly relations with Iran and with other regional Moslem
countries.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Ankara-Tehran ties, he said that his country had
no intention to violate the Iranian airspace and if such incidents
had taken place they were outside the will and intention of the
Turkish government.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Retains Chernomyrdin as PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia's re-elected President Boris
Yeltsin said today that he would retain Viktor Chernomyrdin as his
prime minister and promised to continue reforms during his new
term of four years in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a nationally televised address one day after he was
officially proclaimed re-elected, Yeltsin said he needs a strong
government to implement his program of actions up to the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that Viktor Chernomyrdin must head the government,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin, 58, has been a loyal Yeltsin ally since becoming
prime minister in December 1992.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said he had already commissioned Chernomyrdin to
prepare proposals on a new composition and structure of the
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet, he went on to say, must be made up of
professionals and "competent and fresh people."
</P>
<P>
He also noted that he does not oppose the admission of
representatives of different political forces, including the
Communist Party, into the government.
</P>
<P>
"I do not oppose if representatives of these or those parties
would be in the government. There is only one provision: they
must forget about their political affiliation," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
He then promised to continue carrying out reforms, but added
that the nation's economic policy needs serious adjustment.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary "to revive production, to provide enterprises
with orders and people with work, to force growth of living
standards of each Russian family," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Yeltsin said he has already carried out a program of
actions against crime.
</P>
<P>
"The struggle against corruption in all echelons of power will
be the most important direction of my work," he said.
</P>
<P>
He promised his countrymen that during the next four years he
will do everything to make the country maintain stability and calm.
</P>
<P>
Having thanked the Russians for the trust they showed at the
presidential elections on June 16 and July 3, Yeltsin recognized
that elections have become "an important lesson" for him because
he was able to see his own drawbacks and mistakes in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
The Central Electoral Commission officially declared on Tuesday
Yeltsin's re-election as Russian president.
</P>
<P>
The commission said a total of 74.81 million people, or 68.89
percent of registered voters, took part in the second round of the
voting.
</P>
<P>
Of them, 40.2 million, or 53.82 percent, cast their ballots for
Yeltsin, and 30.21 million, or 40.31 percent, voted for his
communist challenger Gennady Zyuganov and 5.87 percent voted
against both of them.

<HEADLINE> Labor Party Criticizes Netanyahu For Hardline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 10 (Xinhua) -- In its reaction to Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hardline remarks in Washington, the
opposition Labor Party has charged that he has in fact closed
peace options.
</P>
<P>
Moshe Shahal, Member of Knesset (MK) and former minister of
public security, said, "what Mr. Netanyahu did in Washington has
proved that he is more connected with his slogans before
elections than to be a prime minister trying to find a way to
solve problems."
</P>
<P>
He noted that Netanyahu has come into what he called "a
collision course" with the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
"I am very afraid that new activities of terrorism are going to
take place. I am very concerned about what is going to happen
between Israel and Syria, specially if there is disharmony between
Israel and the United States of America."
</P>
<P>
Labor MK Haggai Merom said that nobody can hide the
differences in the point of views between Netanyahu and President
Clinton at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
"Until November there will be no clashes. But after the
elections, no doubt, Clinton, if elected, will put pressure on
Israel and Mr. Netanyahu to follow agreements and implement every
word of the agreements that have been signed. And let's not forget
that the U.S. has signed the agreements as a partner."
</P>
<P>
"We don't like American pressure here and we insist in
Israeli independence and that its government should take any
decisions needed here," he said. "But let's not forget the
U.S. is an international superpower. It cannot look at the
situation here to allow it to collapse, or withdraw in the
peace process, keeping silence."
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel gets three billion a year of foreign aid
for the U.S.. "There is no doubt in a way that something is at
stake for whom to give the aid," he added.

It then reaffirmed the historic importance of the election of
an African as Secretary-General of the United Nations, "thus
enabling Africa to significantly contribute to the attainment of
the principles enshrined in the U.N. Charter and promote
multilateralism."
</P>
<P>
The African countries therefore "recommends that the necessary
steps be taken with all the partners, members of the U.N., to give
Africa a second mandate, for the next five years, and recommends
the candidature of Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali for a second term as
Secretary-General of the U.N."
</P>
<P>
The United States has threatened to veto the reappointment of
the 73-year-old Egyptian for a second five-year term, saying that
Boutros-Ghali has become an obstacle towards U.N. reform.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton Administration was not happy with his hesitation to
approve the nomination of Joseph Cornnor, an American professor,
to head the U.N. management department, to establish an internal
oversight office on waste and abuse of power and to approve the
1996-1997 zero growth budget.

<HEADLINE> EU to Integrate Small- and Middle-sized Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) urged its
member countries today to join effort to help integrate the small
and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to boost the economic
competitiveness of the organization.
</P>
<P>
In the Integrated Program adopted by the European Commission
(EC), the regional alliance's executive arm, the EU called for an
integrated approach by member states to favor the SMEs, an action
that is also a major source of job creation in EU nations.
</P>
<P>
The Integrated Program is to ensure a closer partnership
between all parties concerned with the development of SMEs at
community, national and regional level with a view to enhancing
the convergence and effectiveness of the measures taken.
</P>
<P>
The EC stressed that this program is not intended to replace
the various measures being taken at national or community level,
nor to interfere in the decision-making processes relating to
these measures.
</P>
<P>
Upon adoption of the program, EC Commissioner for Enterprise
Policy Christos Papoutsis said: "Our priority and strong political
will is to help our small and medium-sized enterprises to unlock
their potential, to preserve and also create employment."
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, many of the initiatives and measures
already taken by the community and the member states "are
unfortunately narrowly targeted and too disparate".
</P>
<P>
"So, they are not easily accessible, they are not visible," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In the Integrated Program, a set of objectives for actions are
listed:
</P>
<P>
-- Simplify and improve the administrative and regulatory
environment;
</P>
<P>
-- Improve the financial and fiscal environment for enterprises;
</P>
<P>
-- Help SMEs to Europeanize and internationalize their
strategies, in particular through better information services;
</P>
<P>
-- Enhance SMEs competitiveness and improve their access to
research, innovation, information technologies and training.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- France will send two satellites, the
Arabsat-2A and Turksat-1C, this evening at the Kourou space center
in French Guyana with the 89th European Ariane rocket, the French
National Center of Space Study CNES said today.
</P>
<P>
The two satellites, both made by the Aerospatiale company of
France, will be dropped by Ariane at two permanent geostationary
positions of 26 degrees east above Zaire and 31.3 degrees east
above Uganda, said a CNES communique.
</P>
<P>
The Turksat, to be orbiting the earth on 26 degrees for the
Turk Telecom, will be followed by intermediary stations in
Australia, Canada, Britain and Turkey. The Arabsat will be
followed by ground stations in Australia, China, the United
States, Germany, Italy and Saudi Arbia, said CNES.
</P>
<P>
The space center in Toulouse, southern France, will coordinate
the ground stations in satellite control and calculation of
satellite operations.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Lawmakers Ask Japan to Compensate Comfort Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korean lawmakers today asked
the Japanese government to compensate the women who were forced
into sex slaves by the Japanese army during World War II.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Japanese Embassy here, 270 members of South
Korea's National Assembly, namely parliament, said that Tokyo
should no longer evade its responsibility over the women victims,
but instead admit the crime of its aggresive war.
</P>
<P>
They noted that it is government compensation, not civilian
funds, that should be given to the victims.
</P>
<P>
A total of 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were reportedly
recruited as comfort women for the Japanese army as it invaded
East and Southeast Asia in the 1930s and 1940s.
</P>
<P>
Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony from 1910 until
Tokyo's World War II defeat in 1945.

<HEADLINE> South African President Mandela Starts Visit to Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela started his first state visit to Britain earlier today in
a bid to encourage British businessmen to make further investment
in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Speaking shortly after his arrival in London, Mandela is quoted
as saying, "I am among friends, I hope that this visit will help
all around relations -- political, economic and others."
</P>
<P>
The-78-year-old President stressed that he would use the visit
to thank the British government for the "massive support they have
given our government."
</P>
<P>
"It must not be forgotten that the masses of the people in this
country and elsewhere, were in the forefront of the anti-apartheid
struggle," he said.
</P>
<P>
This afternoon, Queen Elizabeth, accompanied by British Prime
Minister John Major and other senior government officials, staged
a grand welcoming ceremony in honor of President Mandela at the
Horse Guards Parade.
</P>
<P>
During the four-day-visit, Mandela, who spent 27 years in
prison in South Africa before becoming the country's president, is
expected to address a joint session of the British parliament.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, accompanied by a delegation of more than one hundred
businessmen, is due to hold talks with officials of the Bank of
England and the Confederation of British Industry to discuss
further British investment in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, eight British universities would award
President Mandela honorary degrees at a joint ceremony to be held
at the Buckingham Palace.

<HEADLINE> UK Tube Strike Sets to Escalate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 10 (Xinhu) -- Drivers of the London Underground
(LU) are to stage a further nine 24-hour strikes over the next two
months in their dispute over a shorter working week, their union,
Aslef, announced Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The union's executive agreed to cancel a strike called for next
Tuesday and to enter talks with London Transport at the Advisory
Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas), but set nine more
dates for 24-hour walkouts: July 18, 25 and 29; August 7, 13, 23
and 27; and September 5 and 9.
</P>
<P>
Tony West, assistant general secretary of the union said he
hoped the "serious escalation" of the industrial action would not
take place and the union regretted disruption caused by its three
one-day strikes so far over the last fortnight, but blamed LU for
reneging on a deal to cut the working week by one hour.
</P>
<P>
Ann Burfutt, London Transport's director of human resources,
said: "We are saddened that Aslef have notified us of further
dates for industrial action which could be linked to potential
action by the RMT (Rail, Maritime and Transport union). We do,
however, welcome the opportunity to get round the table at Acas."

<HEADLINE> UK Deserves to Be Semiconductor Capital of Europe, Lang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The UK electronics sector has earned
a world-wide reputation as a centre for excellence based on
innovation and quality.
</P>
<P>
Britain is now widely as the semiconductor capital of Europe
with more fabrication plants than any other country.
</P>
<P>
The success of the industry was highlighted today by the
publication of the Invest in Britain Bureau (IBB) Annual Review of
Operations 1996. The review shows that the UK is now home to
manufacturing plants for 11 of the world's 20 leading electronics
companies.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the electronics section of the review, President
of the Board of Trade, Ian Lang said: "The semiconductor capital
of Europe is an impressive title and, with over half of the
world's leading electronics companies based here and an
electronics industry worth an estimated 22 billion pounds (33
billion US dollars), it is one that the UK well deserves."
</P>
<P>
"In the past year we have seen electronics investment projects
coming to the UK from North America, Asia and continental Europe
bringing with them many thousands of skilled jobs," the president
said.
</P>
<P>
The electronics sector is vital to many other industries, such
as car manufacturing and telecommunications, where it has
benefited and contributed to their increased productivity.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Lang said, these supply chains would create real
opportunities for large numbers of British firms.

<HEADLINE> OAU Summit Ends With African Unity Strengthened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Guo Ming
</P>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The 32nd summit meeting of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), which closed here today amid
the solemn OAU anthem, adopted the Yaounde Declaration to prepare
the continent for entering the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The closing ceremony, attended by heads of state, government
chiefs and delegates from 53 OAU member countries as well as
hundreds of international observers, was presided over by hosting
Cameroonian President Paul Biya.
</P>
<P>
"Political stability and economic development are closely
knitted together. The continent could not enjoy peace and
development until war and conflict are resolved in every African
country," said President Biya who is also the current OAU
chairman.
</P>
<P>
After hours of hot debate, the three-day summit
meeting did not adopt any specific resolution on the continent's
"hot spots" including Rwanda, Burundi, Liberia, Somalia and
Sierra Leone, merely calling for all conflicting parties to
resort to peaceful means in acquiring national reconciliation and
regional stability.
</P>
<P>
In an upbeat touch, however, eight out of 11 countries in the
conflict-strife sub-region of central Africa signed a
non-aggression pact, strengthening the conflict prevention
mechanism in the area.
</P>
<P>
Economic issues were highlighted by the summit meeting during
which a total of 11 resolutions were adopted.
</P>
<P>
A decision was made by the summit to convene the Economic and
Social Committee (ECOSOC) by the end of October this year in a
bid to step up the process of economic integration and prepare
for the final establishment of the African Economic Community
(AEC).
</P>
<P>
Two economic resolutions were also adopted for the
African countries to take a common stance on relieving Africa's
unbearable external debt and ensuring food security in the
continent.
</P>
<P>
Checking the spreading of HIV/AIDS, protecting the
environment, and enhancing education, medical care and women's
rights, etc., are among the social issues on which the OAU summit
has adopted resolutions.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to show the African unity, the OAU summit also passed
a collected decision on supporting Boutros Boutros-Ghali's
African candidature for a second term of office as the Secretary
General of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The OAU summit also declared its "unwaiving support" to the
Palestinian struggle for peace and development, stressing the
importance of Afro-Arab friendship and cooperation, and urging
the continuation of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe was announced the next OAU
chairman, and the 33nd OAU summit will be held in the Zimbabwean
capital of Harare.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in US Reaches 54.4 Bln Dlrs in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investments in
the United States totaled 54.4 billion dollars last year, marking
the continuous growth for the third straight year in this country.
</P>
<P>
In its recently released annual report on foreign investment,
the U.S. Commerce Department said direct spending by foreigners to
acquire or establish U.S. businesses shot up 19.2 percent from a
revised 1994 level of 45.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, in spite of the fact that the overall investment
marked the third straight annual increase, in percentage terms it
was far below the great jumps of 74 percent in 1994 and 71 percent
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Still, the advance pushed total investment for the year to the
highest level since 1990, when foreigners spent 65.9 billion
dollars acquiring U.S. business operations. The all-time high for
foreign investment in the U.S. was 72.7 billion dollars, set in
1988.
</P>
<P>
German companies recorded more than a fourfold increase last
year, pushing that country's total to 14.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
For 1995, Japanese investment totaled 3.8 billion dollars, only
one-fifth of the country's 1990 peak of 19.9 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Britain was in second place last year with direct investment in
the United States totaling 9.7 billion dollars, a drop of 44
percent from its 1994 total.
</P>
<P>
Canada was ranked the third with new direct investment of 6.5
billion dollars, a 57 percent jump from 1994.
</P>
<P>
The government report attributed last year's overall increase
in part to a falling dollar. The dollar dropped to record lows
against both the Japanese yen and German mark in the early part of
the year. It also attributed part of the jump in foreign spending
last year to record-high levels for corporate profits, which
attracted overseas investors.

<HEADLINE> Portugal's Population Aging Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lisbon, July 9 (xinhua) -- Portugal's population is aging
rapidly due to a falling birth rate and longer life expectancy,
said a report issued today by the National Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The result of the 1995 population census by the statistics
bureau showed that the total population of Portugal in 1995 was
9.92 million, of which, 14.7 percent were over 65, 17.6 percent
were under 14, and 67.7 percent were between 15 to 49.
</P>
<P>
The birth rate has fallen 36 percent since 1981, from an
average of 2.2 children per woman of child bearing age to 1.41
last year. And Portuguese women are waiting until they are older
before having children, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The average life expectancy of Portuguese men and women has
risen slightly since 1993. In 1994-95 men's life expectancy was
71.5 years, against 71.2 in 1993-94, while women's life expectancy
is 78.6 years against 78.2 in 1993-94, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Portugal has the lowest birth rate among European countries.
The birth rate needs to rise to 2.1 children before population
growth returns to normal, the report said.

<P>
PYONGYANG, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) supported the neutrality maintained by Sweden,
Austria and Finland and their refusal to join the NATO, the
official newspaper Rodong Simon said today.
</P>
<P>
Without mentioning their names, the paper said some countries
alleged Austria, Sweden and Finland would join the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) after their entry into the European
Union (EU) in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the three countries had made clear their refusal
to participate in both the NATO and the Western European Union,
the EU's military arm and a link between the NATO and the EU.
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang favors the three countries' neutrality which it
believes is helpful to their self-determination and European
security and peace, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the DPRK and the three European countries,
which were established "on the basis of self-determination and
inter-dependence", are developing smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Like Sweden, Austria and Finland, the paper said, the DPRK also
highly values its right to self-determination.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Africa Step up Economic Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Guo Ming
</P>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 10 (Xinhua) -- African leaders today moved to
step up economic integration in the continent by agreeing to
inaugurate an Economic and Social Committee (ECOSOC), the engine
to implement the African Economic Community (AEC) treaty.
</P>
<P>
"We have no more time to lose. The ECOSOC ministerial meeting
should be convened by October, 1996," said a resolution adopted
by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) 32nd heads of state
and government summit meeting which closed here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Abuja Treaty which came into effect on May
12, 1994, the community would be finally established by 2025,
five years after the creation of the African Common Market.
</P>
<P>
The ECOSOC meeting at expert level was convened on June 6-7 as
scheduled. But the ministerial meeting, being the inaugural
session of the ECOSOC, was postponed indefinitely, largely owing
to the lack of financial resources for the budget year in many
African countries ended in June.
</P>
<P>
As a result, important decisions and recommendations could not
be adopted as had been expected.
</P>
<P>
"But now, this unfavorable situation has changed," said Vijay
Makhan, OAU Deputy Secretary General in charge of economic affairs
and a devoted advocator of the economic integration in Africa, in
an interview with Xinhua today during the break of the OAU
summit.
</P>
<P>
"The decision is very important to step up the implementation
of the Abuja Treaty which decided to establish the AEC," said
Makhan, a 48-year-old Mauritius who is often soluted as "Mr. AEC"
(African Economic Community) for his long, devoted effort on
promoting Africans' AEC ideal.
</P>
<P>
"The political will is already there because the resolution
was adopted unanimously. Now, the question is, how to mobilize
all the necessary resources to support the integration process,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked what is the biggest challenge faced by Africa's AEC
endeavor, he said: "The unbearable burden of foreign debt."
</P>
<P>
Africa's foreign debt rose to a historical record of 320
billion US Dollars at the end of 1995, an increase of 18 billion
US Dollars compared to that of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
This debt constitutes 80 percent of the total gross domestic
product (GDP) in the continent, which has to pay up their annual
debt servicing duty with nearly 30 percent of their hard-to-earn
foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
"The foreign debt burden has greatly limited our ability to
mobilize the resources, and as a result, has prevented us from
carrying out many necessary tasks," he shrugged.
</P>
<P>
The OAU deputy secretary general criticized the western donors
as "doing too little" in solving Africa's foreign debt problem
and "trying to impose too many conditionalities" on African
countries in rescheduling their foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on the debt issue at the just-concluded summit
meeting of the group of seven industrialized countries, "did not
make any substantial progress," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the OAU resolution adopted today by the summit
meeting, African leaders have also agreed to take a common stance
in solving the foreign debt problem facing the continent.
</P>
<P>
"That is the reality we have to face," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the present circumstances, the top priority is to
strengthen the sub-regional economic blocs which, according to
Makhan, is "the pillars of the AEC under construction."
</P>
<P>
The Mr. AEC also highlighted the urgent need to create a
regional information network to help promote the intra-Africa
trade which, during 1995, accounted for only 6 percent of the
total foreign trade volume of the African countries.
</P>
<P>
"This is something that I want to do most, at present time,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Makhan emphasized on the importance of attracting
foreign investment to Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said Africa, with its investment return rate of 30 percent
which is the highest in the world, should improve its environment
of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
And the OAU is now lobbying all over the world for foreign
investment, especially from the small-and-medium-sized foreign
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"There is also a need to publicize a good deal more about the
AEC so as to let more people understand, and lobby for more
support, for our cause," said Makhan.
</P>
<P>
"Year 2025. The blueprint of the AEC is there. Now comes the
hard part: to implement it, under all circumstances," said the
Mr. AEC.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Gold Output Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Gold output in Zimbabwe rose four
percent to reach 12.17 tonnes worth 150 million US Dollars during
the first six months of this year, the Chamber of Mines of
Zimbabwe said today.
</P>
<P>
This compares with production during the first six months of
1995 which totalled 11.66 tonnes, then worth 120 million US
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The chamber, which has already projected annual gold output
might, for the first time, surpass 25 tonnes this year, was
disappointed that June's production of 1,862.53 kg had fallen
eight percent from the previous month.
</P>
<P>
"We don't really know what caused production to fall, but if
the trend continues, we might reach 25 tonnes," an official of
the chamber said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean gold mines were expected to sustain production on
the back of rising world demand.
</P>
<P>
Gold is currently the most lucrative investment sector of the
mining industry, which is the world's fifth largest industry
(including oil, gas and coal) in terms of capital deployed,
according to the World Gold Council.

<HEADLINE> Okinawa Governor Rejects Hashimoto's Base Request </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Masahide Ota, Governor of Japan's
southernmost island prefecture Okinawa, today in a letter rejected
a request by Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto that he renew a
lease of land in a U.S. military base, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Tokyo, Ota said that he could not meet
the request before a final ruling of the Supreme Court over his
appeal against a lower court decision ordering him to sign
documents needed for continued rental of land owned by Okinawa
residents for use by the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the content of an interim report by a
Japan-U.S. governmental panel on how to reduce U.S. bases in
Okinawa is not satisfactory to people in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
Ota is now in Tokyo for a Supreme Court hearing over the appeal.
</P>
<P>
The central government is pushing for procedures necessary to
use land at 12 U.S. facilities, whose leases expire in May, and
for the Sobe communications installation, whose lease has already
expired.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the prefecture and the U.S. have been
strained since the rape of an Okinawan schoolgirl by three
U.S. servicemen last year.
</P>
<P>
The incident sparked angry protest against the U.S. military
presence on the island and Ota has spearheaded a drive to cut down
on the American presence.

<HEADLINE> UK Commercial Vehicle Sales Stagnate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Growth in the commercial vehicle
market in Britain came to a virtual halt in the first half of this
year, leaving manufacturers of heavy truck worried about their
prospects for 1996 as a whole, according to the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).
</P>
<P>
Figures from the SMMT show that three of the four biggest
market sectors, panel vans, trucks over 3.5 tons and heavy
trucks over 15 tons, fell in June, leaving total new commercial
vehicle sales for the first half of this year just 0.9 percent
higher than a year ago, at 130,907 units.
</P>
<P>
Only an upsurge in sales of small vans last month prevented the
total market in the first half of this year slipping below last
year's level.
</P>
<P>
Most badly-hit last month was the heavy trucks sector, where
sales declined to 2,215 from the previous June's 2,642. This left
the sector more than nine percent down for the year's first six
months.
</P>
<P>
Light van sales in June rose to 5,842 from 4,961 the previous
June; those of panel vans fell to 8,355 from 8,528 and those of
trucks over 3.5 tonnes to 4,050 from 4,521.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Says It Holds Remains of Two Missing Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior officer of the Lebanese
pro-Iranian Hezbbllah, or Party of God, announced here today that
his party was holding the remains of two missing Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
But he denied that he knew the fate of Ron Arad, the Israeli
air force navigator who missed in southern Lebanon after his
plane was shot down in the area on October 16, 1986.
</P>
<P>
In a report on missing Israeli servicemen in southern Lebanon,
Israel said that it had convincing informations that two soldiers,
Yossi Fink and Rahamin Alsheikh, died after their capture by
Hezbollah guerrillas in an ambush in southern Lebanon on February
17, 1986.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in a Beirut office of the Shiite
 fundamentalist party this afternoon, Sheikh Naim Kassem, deputy
secretary general of Hezbollah, said that there were bodies of
two Israeli soldiers in his party's hand.
</P>
<P>
But he did not specify whether the two Israeli soldiers were
Yossi Fink and Rahamin Alsheikh.
</P>
<P>
Israel claimed that the pilot might be alive and held by a
contingent of the Iranian revolutionary guards based in Beqaa
Valley in eastern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The three Israeli soldiers are among six missing in southern
Lebanon. The three others are Zachary Baumel, Zvi Feldman and
Yehuda Katz who disappeared on June 11, 1982 during a tank battle
with Syrian troops in the area and they reportedly were paraded
later in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Israel has lost over 1,000 soldiers in southern Lebanon since
1982, including 19 died in the year.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference especially held to inaugurate
activities marking the Prisoners' Day, which falls on July 14,
the Hezbollah deputy secretary general repeated his party's
proposal of exchanging prisoners with Israel and the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia.
</P>
<P>
As a gesture to underline its sincerity, Hezbollah released
today two SLA militiamen.
</P>
<P>
Kassem reiterated the proposal of exchanging the dozens of
militiamen captured by Hezbollah with those Lebanese detained in
a Israeli-controlled jail at Khiam in the Israeli occupied
"security zone" in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 prisoners are locked by Israel and its
client militia in the hilltop jail at Khiam under accusation
of collaborating with anti-Israeli guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> EC Presents Preliminary Guidelines for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's next
multiannual "framework" research program should focus on six
priority areas and draw up simpler procedures for getting projects
off the ground, the European Commission(EC) said in a Communication
today.
</P>
<P>
The Communication which was adopted by the EC was intended to
open the debate on the fifth research and technological development
framework program which in 1999 will take over from the fourth
framework program now in progress.
</P>
<P>
EC's Research Commissioner Edith Cresson, who presented
preliminary guidelines for the Fifth Framework Program, told a
news conference that it was critical for the EU to narrow the
technological gap with the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
"Europe is lagging behind and the gap is getting worse," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The EC's guideline propose that the Fifth Framework Program
concentrate on the following areas:
</P>
<P>
-- Unlocking the resources of living world and the ecosystem,
covering for example disease prevention and the use of technology to
protect the environment;
</P>
<P>
-- Creating a user-friendly information society;
</P>
<P>
-- Promoting competitive and sustainable growth, covering issues
such as product design, energy and transport efficiency and rural
development;
</P>
<P>
-- Improving human potential, or boosting the training and
mobility of scientists;
</P>
<P>
-- Innovation and participation of small and medium-sized
enterprises;
</P>
<P>
-- Confirming the international role of European research.
</P>
<P>
In implementing these priorities, substantial improvements need
to be made in the management of the research programs, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
Mr Cresson also said that the EC first of all intended ensuring
greater flexibility in the work and the decision-making process,
entailing a streamlining of procedures.
</P>
<P>
For example, at the Intergovernmental Conference the EC will
advocate a simplified decision-making procedure with qualified
majority voting for the framework program and the specific
programs.

ADDIS ABABA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The use of contraceptives,
which stood at 4 percent when the National Population Policy
(NPP) was launched three years ago, has now grown to 8 percent
through efforts made to implement the policy in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian National Population Office announced this in a
statement to mark the third anniversary celebration of the
launching of the NPP on July 12.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's population office head Negussie Tefera said population
offices opened in seven regional states are contributing much in

</P>
<P>
The implementation of the population policy has faced no
resistance from mainstream religious, Negussie said, adding that
he had even witnessed the faithful receiving contraceptives while
returning from church attendance on Sabbath Day.
</P>
<P>
He said the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has
increased its 19 million Dollars five-year assistance to
Ethiopia's population program to 29.3 million Dollars following a
review it has carried out on population policy implementation in
the regions.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has a population of 56 million. The national
population policy of the country was officially launched on July
12, 1993 to coincide with the World Population Day.

MOSCOW, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A re-elected Boris Yeltsin will be
inaugurated on August 9 as the Russian president at the Kremlin's
Cathedral Square.
</P>
<P>
The swearing-in ceremony, presidential spokesman Sergei
Medvedev said today, will be participated by the leaders of the
other former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin became the first Russian president on July 10, 1991,
when he was sworn in before then Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
and the Supreme Soviet, or parliament.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's second inauguration, Medvedev said, will be followed
by receptions in the ornate St. George's Hall and the 505-year-old
Hall of Facets.
</P>
<P>
Russia's recent presidential elections were carried out in two
rounds on June 16 and July 3.
</P>
<P>
During the first round, none of the 10 candidates got over 50
percent of votes, and the top two runners, Yeltsin and Zyuganov,
had to race in a run-off.
</P>
<P>
According to Russia's Central Electoral Commission on Tuesday,
a total of 74.81 million people, or 68.89 percent of registered
voters, took part in the second round of the voting.
</P>
<P>
Of them, 40.2 million, or 53.82 percent, cast their ballots for
Yeltsin, and 30.21 million, or 40.31 percent, voted for his
communist challenger Gennady Zyuganov. The remaining 5.87 percent

<HEADLINE> OAU Summit Fails to Adopt Resolution on Africa's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The 32nd summit meeting of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) today failed to adopt a
resolution on any of Africa's hot spots torn apart by years of
civil wars.
</P>
<P>
OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim told a press
conference following the conclusion of the summit that Burundi,
Rwanda, Liberia, Somalia and Sierra Leone, among other
conflict-ridden African countries remained the focal points under
discussion.
</P>
<P>
According the final communique made available to Xinhua after
the summit, a total of 11 resolutions had been adopted by the OAU
summit, but most of them were concerning the economic and social
issues.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Burundi, which occupied the largest share of
debate at closed-door talks, Salim said considerable progress has
been made in improving the situation there, adding the OAU summit
has voiced its continuous support to the mediation effort between
the Tutsi minority government and the majority Hutus by former
Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere and former United State
president Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
"We are still very concerned over the deterioting situation in
Burundi on which we will take necessary steps to ensure that
there is no repetition of the Rwandan tragedy," said Salim,
referring to the 1994 ethnic cleansing in Kigali.
</P>
<P>
The summit decided to continue the OAU observers mission in
Burundi, after ruling out military intervention into the central
African country which is on the verge of escalation of ethnic
conflict between the Tutsis and the Hutus, according to Salim.
</P>
<P>
He said there is nothing new about OAU's resolve over the
situation in Liberia where, despite the return to peace process
following the signing of the Abuja peace accord last August, a
new round of factional fighting occurred during April and May
this year.
</P>
<P>
The OAU summit also stressed the need to strengthen west
Africa's peacekeeping force in Liberia, known as the ECOMOG, and
called for the mobilization of necessary resources to support the
ECOMOG mission.
</P>
<P>
The summit promised "not to abandon Somalia" and was
"encouraged to see that peace seems to be returning in the
grassroot of the war-torn country," Salim said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Somali delegation was, for the second time since
last year's OAU gathering, absent throughout the Council of
Ministers meeting and the summit, having been rejected by the
organisers beforehand.
</P>
<P>
Salim said the OAU summit was "kind of upbeat" about the
improved situation in Sierra Leone where two rounds of peaceful
general elections were held in February and March.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged the newly elected civil government to narrow its
differences in disarmament and budget-sharing with the rebels,
the remaining two areas after agreement had been reached in
another 26 areas under negotiation.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the press conference, Salim said although there
is not a single resolution on them, "there is still a need to
strengthen the OAU mechanism for conflict prevention, management
and resolution" which was established in 1993.
</P>
<P>
He urged for more contributions to the OAU peace fund by donors
in and outside Africa in a bid to enhance OAU's ability to resolve
conflicts in the region.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Extend 120-Million-Dollar Loan to Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Japan will extend to Lebanon 120
million U.S. dollars in soft loan for 25 years with a 2.5 percent
interest rate in addition to a seven-year grace period, according
to a protocol signed here today by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The protocol was signed by Fuad Sinyoura, Lebanese Minister of
State of Financial Affairs and Yasuji Ishigaki, Japan's ambassador
to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference following the signing ceremony, the
Lebanese minister announced that the soft loan will be used "to
update the sectors of water, health and environment in Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
"The agreement signed today comes within a series of steps
which our two governments have taken in order to consolidate the
bilateral relations," Sinyoura added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that since the reopening of the Japanese Embassy in
Beirut one and half years ago, the two countries had exerted
efforts to consolidate the bilateral relations, including a visit
by the minister to Japan in April and a visit by Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri to Tokyo in June.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that there are a lot of fields where Lebanon can
obtain additional and soft loans from Japan," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Japanese ambassador said that the loan is the
first one the Japanese government provided to Lebanon since the
establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries in
the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
He said that the loan would be used to treat the maritime
pollution along the Lebanese coast and to build networks of water
distribution in Kesrwan province in northern Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> UN Appoints New Head of its Mission to Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali appointed Norbert Heinrich Holl (Germany) as
the new Head of the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan,
a U.N. spokeswoman announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Sylvana Foa said that Holl succeeded Mahmoud
Mestiri, who resigned last May due to health reasons.
</P>
<P>
Until his new appointment, Holl, a German national, was the
Director for South Asia of the Federal Foreign Office in Bonn
since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan, a landlocked country, was invaded by the former
Soviet Union in 1979 at the invitation of the government to put
down the widespread popular revolts. The Soviet troops were
withdrawn in early 1989. But, the fighting has continued since. In
the lasting civil war, 1.7 million people or 10 percent of the
population lost their lives and more were displaced.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution on
December 21, 1993, which requested the Secretary-General to
dispatch to Afghanistan a U.N. special mission to canvass a broad
spectrum of the leaders of Afghanistan, soliciting their views on
how the U.N. can best assist Afghanistan in facilitating the
national rapprochement and reconstruction. The U.N. special mission
headed by Mestiri began its work in Afghanistan in March 1994.

<HEADLINE> OAU Summit Silent on Inter-state Conflicts in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The closed-door summit meeting of
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) kept silence on the
inter-state conflicts in Africa, OAU Secretary General Salim
Ahmed Salim said here today.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference following the closing of the three-day
summit, Salim said the land dispute of the Bakassi peninsula
between Cameroon and Nigeria, and the refugee dispute between
Rwanda and Zaire, "were neither on the OAU summit agenda nor
being neglected."
</P>
<P>
"On the question of inter-state conflict, the less noise made,
the more helpful," said Salim.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief criticized some media for exaggerating the
conflicts, leading to the worsening of the situation.
</P>
<P>
The OAU hoped that the related countries could solve their own
problems without "interference or intervention" by the regional
body, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Bakassi issue, Salim said the dispute had already been
submitted to the United Nations international court of justice in
the Hague, "so there is no sense in fussing about it any more" at
the OAU forum.
</P>
<P>
Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema, entrusted by the OAU,
is continuing to play his mediation role between Nigeria and
Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian head of state General Sani Abacha, who did not attend
the OAU summit meeting held in the Cameroonian capital of
Yaounde, said earlier that he was not willing to discuss the
Bakassi issue at the OAU forum, as insisted by the Cameroonian
government.
</P>
<P>
On the Rwanda-Zaire dispute on refugees, Salim said at the
present stage, it would be better that the issue be resolved by
the relative parties themselves.
</P>
<P>
There was quite a bit of fingerpointing at each other between
the two delegations to the OAU summit.
</P>
<P>
The Zairese delegates threathened the use of force against the
Rwandan refugees in its territory while the Rwandan delegates
retorted "nonsense", saying the Tutsi-dominated Kigali government
is ready to receive the Hutu refugees without any problem.
</P>
<P>
After much hot debate during the closed-door session, the OAU
summit chose to keep silence on the issue without adopting any
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to watch closely over the situations there,"
said Salim, the OAU chief.

<P>
JERUSALEM, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of Palestinians took to
the street today to protest against Israel's delay of redeployment
in the West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
A pipebomb was thrown at an Israeli roadblock in the police
square this morning. Bomb experts rushed to the scene to detonate
the device in a controlled explosion.
</P>
<P>
Protesters then gathered hurling stones and bottles at the
Israeli soldiers, who chased the stone-throwers, trying to catch
them, but failed.
</P>
<P>
The protesters dispersed themselves. There were no reports of
injuries or damages.
</P>
<P>
The army sealed off the area, shutting down shops in the market
area and imposed a curfew.
</P>
<P>
Many Hebron residents thought that Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu would announce redeployment from Hebron as a
peace gesture during his current visit to Washington, but they
have been disappointed thus far.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Speaker Censures Netanyahu's Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority's (PA)
Legislative Council Speaker Abu Ala lashed out this evening at
the remarks made by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in
the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in
East Jerusalem, Abu Ala said that Netanyahu's remarks were
disappointing.
</P>
<P>
"Netanyahu gave indications that he will continue with
settlements, and did not give a timetable for redeployment in
Hebron or for the negotiations on the final phase," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I see Netanyahu's position was dangerous. He is giving a new
concept of peace: security for peace. But the concept of the
current peace process is based on land for peace," Abu Ala pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
The speaker noted: "Settlements are a cancer that can kill the
peace process, an aggression on the Palestinians, and are
illegitimate."
</P>
<P>
He called on the U.S. to take a more resolute and decisive
position regarding settlements.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian Council member Abbas Zaki said that as
Netanyahu was simply ignoring the Palestinian concerns, the PA
would not be able to control the anger of the people.
</P>
<P>
Zaki, also a member of the Fatah Revolutionary Council, warned
of possible outbreak of renewed Intifada (Palestinian uprising in
the late 1980s) in the Palestinian land.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Netanyahu's Hardline Statements in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Party, Israel's
opposition party, today charged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
had in fact closed peace options in the Middle East during his
current visit to the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Moshe Shahal, a Labor Party's member of the Knesset (Israel's
parliament), said that Netanyahu has approved that he is more
connected with his slogans during the elections than to be a
premier trying to solve problems.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who held talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton in
Washington Tuesday, reportedly made no concessions neither on
the Palestinian-related issues, nor on the negotiations with the
Syrians.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the U.S. congress today, the Israeli prime minister
repeated his hardline positions toward the peace process, and
made no mention of any compromises in the peace talks with
Israel's Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Shahal, internal minister in the previous Labor government,
said relations between Israel and its Arab neighbors are in
danger, adding that new terrorist activities may go to take place
in the region.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his concerns about "what is going to happen
between Israel and Syria, specially if there will be a disharmony
between Israel and the U.S. administration."
</P>
<P>
Hagai Meirom, another Labor Knesset member, indicated that the
Israeli-U.S. relations would also meet obstacles as the
U.S. would pressure Israel if there is no progress in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Syrian and Egyptian newspapers today have blasted
Netanyahu for what they termed as his uncompromising positions in
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian official newspaper Tishreen said that Netanyahu
presented nothing new in his discussions with Clinton, and even
did not demonstrate intention regarding of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The paper accused the Israeli prime minister of addressing
Arab with arrogance, and with some languages used by Adolf Hitler
during the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian newspaper Al-Akhbar warned of the limits of Arab
patience, saying that Netanyahu's recent remarks are provocative,
and that "he is wrong if he thinks he can scare Arabs to
capitulate to Israel's control."

<HEADLINE> Formation of Unified Army in Angola Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The work to integrate Angola's
former UNITA rebels into a unified army was suspended today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced by General Joao De Matos, the Chief
of General Staff of the Angolan armed forces here today.
</P>
<P>
Joao De Matos said the Angolan government has also decided to
withdraw its technical personnel who are working in the assembly
points of the UNITA troops.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made because the UNITA "is not earnest in
solving a problem of vital importance to the state," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, the peace process in Angola is irreversible and
the suspension of the formation of the unified army is a
setback only, not a breakdown.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the unified army started on July 1.
Under an initial plan, 26,000 of the 52,000 UNITA soldiers in
the assembly points should be integrated in the unified army.

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops Bombed Chechen Rebel Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian troops were shelling and
bombing two villages in Chechnya today, including the one
presumably sheltering the rebel headquarters.
</P>
<P>
According to Itar-Tass news agency and Interfax news agency
reports, air and artillery forces were used in the escalated
fighting to deliver strikes to the villages of Makhety and Gekhi.
</P>
<P>
Makhety, 35 kilometers south of the Chechen regional capital of
Grozny, is believed to be the site of the headquarters of
separatist leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev.
</P>
<P>
And Gekhi, in southwestern Chechnya, is a strongly
pro-separatist village.
</P>
<P>
The renewed fighting, beginning Tuesday, took place six weeks
after the warring parties signed a peace pact in the Kremlin and a
week after President Boris Yeltsin's re-election.
</P>
<P>
Major Igor Melnikov, a Russian military spokesman in Chechnya,
was quoted as denying that civilians were being targeted in the
offensives by federal troops.
</P>
<P>
However, local officials said that at least 20 civilians were
killed and many others wounded in Mahkety today.
</P>
<P>
Earlier government reports said that eight Russian soldiers
were killed and about 20 more injuried in Gekhi on Tuesday, in
addition to more than 10 deaths on the rebel side.
</P>
<P>
None of the casualties could be independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 people had been killed in the 19-month-old
conflict in the breakaway republic before Yeltsin and Yandarbiyev
arranged a truce and agreed to exchange prisoners.
</P>
<P>
In his explanation today, Melnikov said the attack on Makhety
was not a violation of the May 27 agreement but merely a response
to violations from the rebel side.

<P>
In the Gaza strip, Palestinian National Authority (PNA)'s
Local Government Minister Saeb Erekat said today that the peace
process is beginning "to slip through our fingers."
</P>
<P>
Erekat said that while Netanyahu was speaking peace in
English, but when it comes to implementing the agreement, he
gives entirely different instructions in Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
Abbas Zaki, a member of the Palestinian Council, said that
Netanyahu was ignoring Palestinian concerns, and that the PNA
will not be able to control the anger of the people.
</P>
<P>
He also warned of a possible upgrade of renewal of the
Intifada (Palestinian uprising in the late 1980s).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, dozens of Palestinian residents of Hebron clashed
with Israeli troops this morning to protest the delay of Israel's
redeployment in the disputed West Bank town.
</P>
<P>
A pipebomb was thrown at an Israeli roadblock in the police
square in the center of Hebron, Israeli bomb explosive experts
rushed to the scene and detonated the device in a controlled
explosion.
</P>
<P>
The clash reportedly lasted for an hour, as Palestinian youths
threw stones and bottles at the Israeli soldiers before they were
finally dispersed by the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The army then sealed off the area, shutting down shops in the
market areas, and imposing a curfew.
</P>
<P>
No injury or damage was reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo 2 accord signed between Israel and the
Palestinians, the Israeli army was supposed to pullback from about
85 percent of Hebron by March 28. However, the redeployment was
delayed following a series of suicide bombing attacks against
Israelis in late February and early March, which killed 62 people.
</P>
<P>
In May, the former Israeli government led by Shimon Peres
announced that the army's withdrawal from Hebron would be carried
out after the May 29 general elections, due to security reasons.
</P>
<P>
However, Peres, defeated by Netanyahu, said after the
elections that he would leave the decision of the redeployment to
the new prime minister and his government.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, some 30 kilometers southwest of Jerusalem, is a place
of pilgrimage for Christians, Jews and Moslems alike, and
tradition has it that patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their
wives are all buried in the Machpelah Cave (Haram al-Khalil).
</P>
<P>
There are some 400 Jewish settlers now living in the center of
Hebron, who moved back to the city's old Jewish neighborhood after
the 1967 Middle East War, during which Israel took over the town
from the Jordanian authority.
</P>
<P>
Surrounding the Jewish community, there are more than 200,000
Palestinian residents living in most other parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
During his election campaign, Netanyahu had said that he would
like Hebron to be part of the final status arrangements with the
Palestinians, but, at the same time, he also said he would stand
by the international agreements.
</P>
<P>
So far, Netanyahu repeatedly said he has been studying the
issue of the redeployment in Hebron, but giving no date when he
would make the final decision.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio today quoted American sources as saying that the
Israeli premier Tuesday told Clinton at their private meeting
that he would seek a way to implement the redeployment in
Hebron.

CAIRO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdul-Meguid today criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu for his remarks at a joint press conference with
U.S. President Bill Clinton Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference here with Henry Siegman,
Director of the U.S./Middle East Project at the New York-based
Council on Foreign Relations, Abdul-Meguid said that the press
conference at the White House was "not encouraging."
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel must withdraw from all occupied Arab land
before a just and comprehensive peace can be reached. This would
include Syria's Golan Heights, the West Bank and Gaza Strip, south
Lebanon and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"Netanyahu is playing with fire and he will burn himself first
before anyone else," the Arab League chief said.
</P>
<P>
The Arabs are committed to U.N. Security Council resolutions as
well as the land-for-peace principle, he said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, at the White House news conference, challenged the
land-for-peace formula as the only basis for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel has a different view of U.N. Security
Council resolution 242, which urged Israel to return land seized
in the 1967 Mideast war in exchange for peace. He maintained
Israel has made "substantial concessions on all fronts."
</P>

Abdul-Meguid co-chaired with Siegman, a Middle East specialist,
a two-day seminar on Arab-U.S. relations which ended here Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's First Kurdish TV Starts Broadcasting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A privately-owned television
channel, CAN TV, started today regular broadcasting in Kurdish,
becoming the first of its kind in the history of the highly
Kurdish populated southeast of Turkey, the semi-official Anatolia
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Nevzat Bingol, owner of the CAN TV based in
southeastern Diyarbakir, as saying that their broadcasting was
limited to only several hours a day. But he added that they wanted
to expand the broadcasting to 24 hours a day in the future.
</P>
<P>
"For the time being we only have music programs in
Kurdish. Music is universal. And, I don't suppose that anyone can
claim that we are propagating separatism because we let people
listen to music in Kurdish. Music has no language," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the current Turkish legislation regarding the use
of Kurdish, Bingol said that Kurdish was not actually illegal.
</P>
<P>
"We want to have a law which will make it clear what
is illegal and what is legal. We are definitely ready to act in
line with it later on," he noted.

JOHANNESBURG, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Namibia's agriculture

international assistance, the South African Press Association
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said Namibian Finance Minister Helmut Angula has
invited the Namibian Agruculture Union (NAU) to an urgent meeting
to discuss the situation.

According to the report, the number of the beef cattle in
Namibia has declined by 56 percent from the previous 2 million
head to the present 870,000. Small stock has seen a decrease from

<HEADLINE> Clinton Praises Legislation Against Church Arson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today praised a new law to prevent church arson, saying a
significant number of recent fires at places of worship were
racially motivated.
</P>
<P>
At a Rose Garden ceremony heralding the Church Arson Prevention
Act he signed last week, Clinton said, "We have to continue our
struggle against racism and religious bigotry."
</P>
<P>
The new law makes the destruction of places of worship a
federal crime.
</P>
<P>
Calling the burning of churches an "outrage," Clinton said that
since January of 1995, more than 190 incidents of fire or
desecration of houses of places of worship have been reported in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said while many have been targeted at black churches in the
South, there have also been attacks on synagogues, mosques, and
white churches in all parts of this country.
</P>
<P>
More arrests are being made and in the last three weeks, there
have been arrests in connection with fires in North Carolina,
South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, Washington and Missouri, he said.
</P>
<P>
The new law doubles the maximum penalty for the crimes that
cause injury to people and increases the statute of limitations
from five to seven years.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said several government agencies have been mobilized to
prosecute arsonists, prevent burnings, and help communities
rebuild.

<HEADLINE> Two   Million Children Suffer From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- An estimated two million children
in Nigeria, aged between five and 14, are infected with
schistosomiasis, Minister of Health Ihechukwu Madubuike said here
today.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar on ''schistosomiasis control'', the minister said
the disease is prevalent in the northernmost part of the country
and affecting the rural and urban communities with poor sanitary
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The use of earth dams for irrigation and domestic purposes
predisposes the people to the disease usually carried by snails
which are everywhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
The impact of the disease on children, according to the
minister, is felt on reduced growth and development as well as
malnutrition. It could result in hypertension, infertility and
cancer of the bladder.
</P>
<P>
The government started a national schistosomiasis control
program as early as in 1988 to bring the disease under control,
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Children's Fund and Global 2000 are
initiating efforts to support the program, he said, adding that
the World Health Organisation is providing technical support.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, there is a bright future for the coordinated
efforts to control the disease, he said.  enditem

<P>
The body of the tourist, Gerd-Ulrich Ladwig, was Tuesday found

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Says Jerusalem Not to Be Redivided </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu declared today that Israel will not allow Jerusalem to
be redivided between Arabs and Jews.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the U.S. Congress, Netanyahu said, "There have
been efforts to redivide this city by those who claim that peace
can come through division, that it can be secured through multiple
sovereignties, multiple laws and multiple police forces."
</P>
<P>
"This is a groundless and dangerous assumption, and it impels
me to declare today there will never be such a redivision of
Jerusalem," he pounded the lectern in the House of Representatives
for emphasis.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem has been a holy city to Arabs, Jews and Christians
alike and its eastern part, the Arabs' residential quarter, was
occupies by Israeli forces in the 1967 war with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Israeli authorities have ever since declared Jerusalem as
Israel's capital, but the United States and most other nations do
not recognize it as such.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat quickly
reacted in Gaza to Netanyahy's statement by accusing him of
"lying" about the Palestinian position on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"It's a pity that Mr Netanyahu begs the sympathy of the
Congress by lying on the Palestinian position on Jerusalem," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the allegation Netanyahu made in the Congress that
the Palestinians intend to erect within Jerusalem "a Berlin
Wall," the spokesman said, "President Arafat and the Palestinian
Authority do not want to divide the city, do not want to build a
wall, do not want to put up barbed wires."
</P>
<P>
"They want a unified city, the capital for two peoples and
this is the time that the president (Arafat) feels that he would
stress the right of the Palestinians in Jerusalem, the city and
the capital of the coming Palestinian State," he said.

<HEADLINE> Citroen to Transfer Know-How Program to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Automobile Citroen, one of France's
two leading auto producers, today announced a plan to transfer its
technological know-how training programs for China from the home
base to that country.
</P>
<P>
Gerard Billon, head of the Quality and Management Department at
the Training Center of Institute Citroen in Saint-Ouen, northwest
Paris, said that Citroen will build in September a training center
in Wuhan by copying the one here in Paris, for the joint venture
Dong Feng Citroen Automobile Company (DCAC) in Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of DCAC in 1992, which produces
Citroen's ZX cars that are named "Fu Kang" in China, all training
programs have been made in Paris.
</P>
<P>
About 500 Chinese trainees have since 1993 joined the programs
on integrating the terminal factory in Wuhan with the mechanical
factory in Xiangfan, which are 1,000 kilometers away from each
other in Hubei, said Citroen officials.
</P>
<P>
"The aim is that the two factories will be completely
automonous from 1997," said Billon, adding that "from production
to sale, all aspects of training will be put under one roof" in
the planned training center in Wuhan with 500,000 training hours
expected for the first two years.
</P>
<P>
He also said Citroen will send 50 cadres to China to make sure
of the success of the Wuhan center and Citroen plans to expand its
factory in Wuhan to the size of that in Aulnay-sous-Bois in
Seine-Saint-Denis in Paris with about 8,000 personnel.
</P>
<P>
Citroen will invest 7.5 billion francs (1.5 billion U.S.
dollars) in the first phase of the construction of DCAC, said
Billion, adding that the factory should produce 150,000 vehicles
in 1997 and 300,000 in the following year.
</P>
<P>
Calling the previous plan "an action of foundation," Philippe
Roch, head of Human Resources of China Program of Citroen, said
that the corporation does not expect much profit in the first 10
years from DCAC.
</P>
<P>
"The two keys to success are a transfer of tested technology
and a good integration of the two local factories," he said.

<HEADLINE> Ghali Assured Africa of "UN Special Initiative" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 10 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali today assured Africa of the UN special
initiative which he said they can depend on.
</P>
<P>
Ghali was nominated as the African candidate for the second
term of his office at the just-concluded 32nd summit meeting of
the organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
"You can depend on the whole system of the United Nations. And
you can depend on me," Ghali, who gave full attendance to the
three-day OAU summit meeting which closed here today, told a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief arrived in Yaounde last Saturday to attend the
OAU summit meeting as a special guest. He is also here seeking
support for his second term as UN Secretary General.
</P>
<P>
On March 15, Ghali and World Bank President James Wolfensohn
co-unveiled the UN "special initiative on Africa", a 10-year
investment plan for the continent worth 25 billion US Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the wide-ranged plan includes strengthening OAU's
capacity in the mechanism for conflict prevention, management and
resolution, reducing Africa's external debt, boosting foreign
investment in Africa and enhancing Africa's export capabilities.
</P>
<P>
It also deals with food security and drought management by
improving soil quality, and promoting control of land degradation
and desertification.
</P>
<P>
"The program involves all the u.n. agencies, together with the
World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the International
Agricultural Development fund, etc.," said Ghali.
</P>
<P>
"And we are expecting full participation of all the OAU member
countries to ensure success of the program," said the UN chief.
</P>
<P>
A diplomat said, "Ghali promised his full consideration of and
support for the interest of the African continent, and the OAU
members owe their trust in him."
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, United States Assistant Secretary of State
George Moose arrived in Yaounde in a bid to persuade some of the
African leaders into voting against Ghali's candidature.
</P>
<P>
"Moose's lobby mission totally failed," said another diplomat.

WASHINGTON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu pleased the U.S. Congress today by fiercely attacking
Iran and Iraq, calling them as "despotic regimes."
</P>
<P>
He strongly backed the U.S. initiative to isolate the two
states and slammed European and Asian countries for maintaining
relations with them.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the U.S. Congress on his second day of the America
tour, the hardline Likud leader said that if the two neighboring
states acquired nuclear weapons, there could be "catastrophic
consequences" for the world.
</P>
<P>
He called on the United States to lead an international effort
to isolate the two states and bragged that only the United States
and Israel have been at the forefront of the efforts to prevent
their acquisition of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
He lectured the European and Asian countries not to be
short-sighted for some material gain.
</P>
<P>
"Europe and the countries of Asia must be made to understand
that it is folly... to pursue short-term material gain while
creating a long-term existential danger for all of us," he said.
</P>
<P>
He won a long ovation in the Congress as the House of
Representatives had approved legislation that would impose
stringent new sanctions on Iran, and the Senate is expected to
consider the measure later this year.

<HEADLINE> Refugees in Yugoslavia Face Serious Humanitarian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The humanitarian situation of
refugees and their host families in Yugoslavia is very serious due
to lack of international aid, Yugoslav refugee officials said
today.
</P>
<P>
The 700,000 refugees living in this country is now having the
toughest situation over all the past five years, Serbian
Commissioner for Refugees Bratislava Morina said.
</P>
<P>
Morina made the remarks at a joint meeting in Belgrade with
Serbian Red Cross President Slobodanka Gruden and Yugoslav Red
Cross General Secretary Rade Dubajic to discuss the serious
situation of the refugees, according to the Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, they all agreed that it was necessary to warn
both the domestic society and the international community about
the huge problems in providing aid to the 700,000 refugees, of
whom the majority have found shelter with relatives and friends in
Yugoslavia, which consists of Serbia and Montenegro, Tanjug
reported.
</P>
<P>
Gruden and Dubajic said their primary task was to find a way to
secure food and personal hygiene packages, because the European
Union's Humanitarian Office has this month stopped sending aid for
refugees in private accommodations.
</P>
<P>
They warned that the situation in collective accommodation
centers was also alarming since there were no means for maintaining
these facilities.
</P>
<P>
A recent census held in Yugoslavia showed that there are
700,000 refugees from former Yugoslav republics now living in
Serbia, which has imposed a heavy economic and social burden on
the country which has suffered greatly from three-and-half-year
international sanctions that were suspended in December last year.
