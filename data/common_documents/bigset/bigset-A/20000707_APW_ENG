criminal contempt and ordered to stand trial next week in a case involving news
leaks during the Monica Lewinsky investigation. Charles Bakaly is being
prosecuted by the government before U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson,

High Temps Sear Southeastern Europe
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- A heat wave baking southeastern Europe sent
temperatures rocketing to 113 degrees in some places Thursday, killing 25
people, melting roads in Turkey and driving hundreds to seek medical help.
Firefighters battled hundreds of blazes sparked by arid conditions in Bulgaria,
Croatia, Greece, Italy and Romania. In Turkey, the heat killed 5,200 chickens
and led camel drivers to wet down their animals to cool them down. In Athens,
sweltering residents snapped up air conditioners and set a record for electric
consumption.

   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- British authorities on Thursday banned a
second Protestant parade from passing through Catholic territory, as the
province suffered through a fifth straight night of tension between the rival
factions. There were concerns that the verdict could further fuel widespread
demonstrations and rioting, and later Thursday Catholic and Protestant groups
skirmished in two parts of Belfast. However, the level of violence was
significantly lower than on previous evenings.

US Cites AIDS Risk to Peacekeepers
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Declaring AIDS ''a truly global risk'' to military
forces, the United States introduced a Security Council resolution Thursday
urging all countries to provide education and voluntary testing for their
troops. The resolution is aimed primarily at nations providing U.N.
peacekeepers, but notes that all uniformed military forces are at risk of both
contracting and spreading HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. It calls for national
education programs for civilians and military personnel to prevent the spread of
the disease and voluntary and confidential AIDS counseling and testing for
members of military forces.

   MIDDLETOWN, R.I. (AP) -- Environmentalists said Thursday they were worried
about the effects of a large oil spill that has killed several birds and led to
a ban on fishing in one of the most fertile areas of Narragansett Bay. The Coast
Guard said 14,000 gallons of oil has spilled out of a barge that collided with a
tug on Wednesday. Five swans died and 50 Canada geese were found blackened with
oil. The 460-foot-long barge was carrying 3.8 million gallons of oil.

ground crews decried passengers whose misbehavior ranges from being noisy to
becoming downright violent. The Transport Workers Federation, an umbrella
organization for the unions, said air rage incidents increased from 1,132 in
1994 to 5,416 in 1997.

By MARTA W. ALDRICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- At 96, ministerial student Ed Schreiber
acknowledges the irony in choosing as his favorite Biblical figure
the prophet Samuel, who was just a boy when he heard God call him
to service.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hear God now,'' said Schreiber, who began his seminary
studies at age 92, ''and I believe I'm being called to be a more
credible witness for Jesus Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, he will become the oldest person ever to graduate
from Memphis Theological Seminary, training he completed through a
condensed program for those with financial, family or other
limitations.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has worked very hard,'' said the Rev. John Leggett,
Schreiber's pastor at Brookhaven Cumberland Presbyterian Church in
Nashville. Schreiber was ordained a pastor in the Cumberland
Presbyterian denomination last month.
</P>
<P>
   His ''post-midlife career change'' -- which came more than two
decades after his careers as schoolteacher and municipal planner --
has inspired his classmates and professors.
</P>
<P>
   Schreiber completed the special seminary program largely through
correspondence, but during summer sessions at Bethel College in
McKenzie, Tenn., he would get up at 5 a.m., finish his homework,
participate in a long study day ''and have more energy than
anybody,'' Leggett said.
</P>
<P>
   A regular challenge was getting to classes on the third floor of
a Bethel building without an elevator. Fellow students would carry
him in a chair up three flights of stairs. Once in the classroom,
Schreiber needed little help.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess there's hope for me at 96,'' said classmate Kirk
Smith, who at 65 was surprised that he wasn't the program's oldest
student.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ed wouldn't say a lot in class. But, when he did, I was amazed
by his words and wit.''
</P>
<P>
   Schreiber's course work included Christian doctrine, church
history, world religions, evangelism and the art of preaching. Last
summer he delivered his first sermon, titled ''Communication,'' to
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   His assessment of his ability?
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not a naturally good speaker,'' he says, ''but I'm
learning to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Thomas Campbell, who directs the seminary program, said
Schreiber is an example to other candidates who worry about being
too old.
</P>
<P>
   ''When people talk that way, I just can't resist. I have to be
anecdotal and tell them about Mr. Schreiber,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Moyers, 30, who has served with Schreiber on several
committees in his home church, said Schreiber shows how ''God's
call can be unpredictable.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a real inspiration how not to get into a rut. It makes me
think that what I'm doing now may not be what I'll do 10 to 20
years from now,'' Moyers said.
</P>
<P>
   With his new credentials, Schreiber doesn't plan to pastor a
church. But he hopes to be a chaplain to his own church's senior
citizens ministry and to fill in when area ministers are absent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can baptize people, conduct weddings and funerals -- all the
privileges of ministry without any of the salary,'' he said with a
smile.
</P>
<P>
   Schreiber has been active in church life since his childhood in
Augusta, Ga., where his father was a Baptist Sunday school
superintendent. He says he became a Cumberland Presbyterian ''by
metamorphosis.''
</P>
<P>
   His unorthodox path into the ministry mirrors an unorthodox
outlook on aging. He doesn't think of himself as old, he said --
just ''chronologically gifted'' -- and attributes his longevity to
good genes. Both parents lived to be 90, and an older brother
reached 92.
</P>
<P>
   Though he stopped driving in 1994, he still lives at home by
himself and goes for short walks. For fun, he travels to annual
national meetings for municipal planners in cities such as Boston,
Seattle and New York. His 27-year-old grandson acts as chaperone.
</P>
<P>
   Schreiber stayed active and positive to get through the pain of
his wife's death in 1991 at age 91. ''Think of all the people -- the
men especially when their wives die -- they don't know how to cook,
how to do much of anything. I've gone eight years as a single
person. When my wife died, I grieved. ... But I didn't let that
stop me.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for mild arthritis in his hands and a scary bout with
pneumonia four years ago, he has stayed healthy and says he feels
''like a 55-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I just have fun living. I have a good sense of humor and
common sense, too,'' he said. ''I take exercise. I study and have a
purpose. I want to be a good influence.''
</P>
<P>
   He also credits church members who help him with errands and
call on him daily ''to make sure I'm OK.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Their presence at the back door brings the joy of anticipation
and a few minutes of conversation that are so beneficial to the
aged person,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A walk through Schreiber's small brick home, less than a mile
from his church, reveals a man of wide interests.
</P>
<P>
   Reading material abounds (he takes about a dozen magazines),
tapes are stacked beside a cassette player and in the living room
is an electric keyboard where he plays hymns, patriotic tunes and
bugle calls.
</P>
<P>
   A prolific writer, he corresponds with family and friends around
the country and writes letters to newspapers and other
publications, mostly about environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   But it is his pursuit of a seminary degree that Schreiber
credits for keeping his spirit and mind engaged in recent years.
''I wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for this course work,'' he said.
''I wouldn't have anything to live for.''

<HEADLINE> Man Gets 6 Months For Oscar Theft  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The trucker accused of stealing 55 Oscar
statuettes just weeks before the Academy Awards pleaded no contest
to a count of grand theft Thursday and was sentenced to six months
in jail and five years probation, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence E. Ledent also must pay $50,000 restitution to
Ohio-based Roadway Express, which fired him after the Oscars
disappeared from a warehouse near Los Angeles in early March.
</P>
<P>
   That amount compensates the company for the reward money it paid
salvage man Willie Fulgear, who found all but three of the
statuettes in a trash bin a week before the Academy Awards show on
March 26.
</P>
<P>
   Ledent also must pay the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts &AMP;
Sciences $1,050 -- $350 for each gold-plated statuette still
missing.
</P>
<P>
   Ledent, 38, has been free on bail. He will begin serving his
sentence Aug. 8, according to the district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   A warehouse loading dock worker also was linked to the theft,
but prosecutors declined to file charges, citing insufficient
evidence.

<HEADLINE> M.L. King III, Sharpton say promoters in IBF scandal should be charged </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Boxing promoters who testified they paid
bribes for favors from the IBF should also face trial, according to
two civil rights leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Luther King III and the Rev. Al Sharpton spoke Thursday
outside the federal courthouse where IBF founder Robert W. Lee has
been on trial on racketeering charges since mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   They have not attended the trial and did not take a position on
Lee's guilt or innocence, or whether Lee is being prosecuted
because he is black, as his defense lawyer suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know enough about the trial to comment about it,''
said Sharpton, president of the New York-based National Action
Network.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged they were concerned about statements made by two
major promoters, Bob Arum and Cedric Kushner, who testified last
month about their roles in $100,000 payoffs to the IBF.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other key witnesses, they testified without immunity.
Arum said he did not seek it; Kushner said prosecutors refused his
request.
</P>
<P>
   King, son of Martin Luther King Jr. and president of the
Atlanta-based Southern Christian Leadership Conference, said,
''There seems to be a double standard that must be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The ones who have admitted to crimes are not being
prosecuted,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   The lead prosecutor against Lee, Jose P. Sierra, said, ''We
can't comment on what charging decisions, if any, will be made.''
He expects to rest his case Friday.
</P>
<P>
   King and Sharpton also said their groups and the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People would have
hearings in the fall to explore whether black and Latino boxers are
losing opportunities because of bribery.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to criminal charges, Arum, who operates Top Rank of
Las Vegas; Kushner, of New York's Cedric Kushner Productions; and
other promoters in the IBF case could lose their licenses to put on
boxing matches.
</P>
<P>
   Their testimony is under scrutiny by officials in New Jersey and
Nevada - the most lucrative states for boxing because of their
casinos - as well as California, which has the most boxing matches
of any state, and New York.
</P>
<P>
   State boxing commissions are also looking at testimony regarding
the sport's biggest promoter, Don King, of Deerfield Beach, Fla.,
and the Duva family of Main Events Inc., of Totowa, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors identify Don King as an unindicted
coconspirator in the Lee case, supported by testimony that he was
the prime beneficiary of Lee's manipulations of the IBF rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton has long been friendly with Don King, but said that
would not matter: ''In our hearings, whether friend or foe, it
doesn't matter. We want to get to the bottom of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton's name surfaced during Kushner's testimony, when he
described a 1991 incident in which Don King and Lee were not
getting along.
</P>
<P>
   The IBF, at its annual convention in New Orleans, was
considering whether to give its approval to championship fights in
South Africa as its apartheid system began to crumble.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner, a native South African and naturalized U.S. citizen,
said he told Lee he favored the change.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner testified he believed that Don King arranged for
Sharpton to bring demonstrators against making the change.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said Thursday he went because he opposed apartheid, not
at the behest of Don King.
</P>
<P>
   Don King spokesman Greg Fritz has said he also opposed
apartheid, but could not say whether he had a role in the Sharpton
protest.
</P>
<P>
   Lee and other IBF officials are accused of taking $338,000 in a
span of more than a decade in exchange for favors and rigged
rankings. No promoters are on trial.
</P>
<P>
   As one of three major sanctioning bodies for boxing in the
world, the rankings and decisions of the East Orange-based IBF play
a large role in the purses earned by boxers, of which managers and
promoters get a cut.

<HEADLINE> Hoboken cop sues football players over beating  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Penn State quarterback Rashard Casey,
Syracuse safety Keeon Walker and a former teammate of theirs at
Hoboken High School are being sued by a police officer who says
they beat him unconscious outside a Hoboken bar in May.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Patrick D. Fitzsimmons does not know when he will return
to work and suffers from headaches, nausea and nightmares from the
beating, said his lawyer, Anthony J. Pope Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzsimmons, 34, of Hoboken, seeks an unspecified amount of
money as compensation for ''severe and painful injuries'' that have
brought ''significant loss in the quality and enjoyment of his
life,'' according to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Casey and the third man, Desmond Miller, have pleaded innocent
to charges of aggravated assault.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Walker tried to stop the attack and was not charged.
</P>
<P>
   The three were sued based on interviews conducted with
witnesses, including an off-duty Jersey City officer, Pope said.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzsimmons appeared with Pope at a news conference Thursday,
but Pope did not permit him to speak.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed June 29 in state Superior Court for Hudson
County in Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
   It accuses all three men of ''maliciously striking and kicking
plaintiff Fitzsimmons repeatedly about the head, face and body.''
</P>
<P>
   Police have said the attack may have been racially motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzsimmons, who is white, was at the Cadillac Bar in Hoboken,
where he met a friend, Elsa Ballantine, of East Orange, who is
black, Pope said.
</P>
<P>
   They left about 2:30 a.m. on May 14, and were confronted on the
street by the defendants, who are black, Pope said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoboken Police Chief Carmen LaBruno has said Casey and Miller
spoke to the woman at the bar. He did not return a call seeking
comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''What are you doing with him? You should be with us. You're one
of us,'' they said, according to the chief, which squared with
Pope's account.
</P>
<P>
   ''She responded to the extent, 'I don't want to be with you, I
want to be with him,''' Pope said.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody mentioned that Fitzsimmons was an officer, which
Fitzsimmons acknowledged before he was assaulted, Pope said. He was
not armed, Pope said.
</P>
<P>
   According to LaBruno, Casey punched Fitzsimmons, and Casey and
Miller kicked the officer in the head once he had fallen, and
continued to kick him after he lost consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Walker told Casey and Miller to stop because Fitzsimmons was a
police officer, LaBruno has said.
</P>
<P>
   Casey, 22, a senior this fall, remains on the team pending the
outcome of an investigation by a Penn State judicial review
committee, school spokesman William M. Mahon said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State football coach Joe Paterno has said he expects Casey
''will be exonerated when all of the facts are examined.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey's lawyer, Dennis D. McAlevy, said, ''Mr. Casey, as far as
I know, was just walking down the street, and got arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My investigation has disclosed that off-duty Police Officer
Fitzsimmons was visibly intoxicated and embracing and kissing and
rubbing his body against a woman other than his wife in the middle
of Newark Street just prior to the alleged assault,'' McAlevy said
Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ''What relevance does that have?'' Pope responded. ''What
matters is without any provocation my client was attacked.''
Fitzsimmons is married, but was not out with his wife that night.
They have no children, Pope said.
</P>
<P>
   No listing could be found for Ballantine.
</P>
<P>
   Casey, who led Penn State to a victory in the Alamo Bowl last
year, graduated from Hoboken in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, 20, of Hoboken, a redshirt sophomore this fall, told his
coach, Paul Pasqualoni, that he tried to break up the fight, said
Sue Edson, a Syracuse sports spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Walker remains on the team and was moved in spring practice from
running back to strong safety, Edson said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 22, of Jersey City, could not be reached for comment. No
listing could be found.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzsimmons is a five-year veteran who teaches tolerance
training in the community policing division.

<HEADLINE> Man Pleades Guilty To Smuggling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- A man pleaded guilty Thursday to smuggling Thai
women into Texas and forcing them to work as prostitutes to pay off
their transportation debts.
</P>
<P>
   Phiet The Mai, 27, admitted participating for two years in an
international smuggling ring based in Bangkok, Thailand, that
brought Thai and Chinese nationals into the United States. Members
of the group have claimed they could smuggle as many as 100 Chinese
immigrants per month.
</P>
<P>
   Mai pleaded guilty to charges that included conspiracy,
falsifying immigration papers, smuggling the women for the purpose
of prostitution and transporting illegal aliens. He faces five
years in prison and fines up to $250,000 at his sentencing Oct. 16.
He also could be deported.
</P>
<P>
   Mai paid his bosses in Bangkok about $15,000 for each woman
brought from Thailand to be employed in Houston ''modeling
studios,'' according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney's office
in Houston. They were forced to work as prostitutes until they paid
a $40,000 smuggling fee.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has said the women,
most of whom are in their 20s, will be asked to leave the country
voluntarily or will be deported.
</P>
<P>
   Six other people who were indicted on similar charges are
scheduled for trial July 17.

<HEADLINE> Lincoln's Summer Home To Be Monument  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Lincoln's summer retreat, a hilltop
cottage on the outskirts of Washington where he drafted the
Emancipation Proclamation, becomes one of America's official
national monuments on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a visit to the cottage, President Clinton is to sign a
proclamation designating the 157-year-old landmark as President
Lincoln and Soldiers' Home National Monument, a White House
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The president also will announce new program grants by Save
America's Treasures, including a $750,000 award for the cottage, to
preserve historic sites nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Each summer from 1862 to 1864, Lincoln and his wife escaped the
heat and humidity of the White House by taking up residence at the
cottage, about three miles from the White House. The 14-room home,
built in an early gothic revival architectural style, remains much
as it was in Lincoln's day. He commuted there by horseback or
carriage and often read and relaxed beneath a copper beech tree
that still stands beside the house.
</P>
<P>
   ''On a clear day, you look down and you can see the Capitol and
many of the monuments of Washington,'' a White House official said.
</P>
<P>
   The house is located on the grounds of what used to be called
Soldiers' Home, the first home for disabled veterans of the U.S.
Army. Part of the home now is being used as office space for the
Armed Forces Retirement Home, which manages the U.S. Soldiers' and
Airmen's Home.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln drafted the Emancipation Proclamation at the cottage in
September 1862 and last visited the home the day before his
assassination. The cottage also served as a summer retreat for
Presidents Buchanan, Hayes and Arthur.
</P>
<P>
   The grants are being awarded by Save America's Treasures, a
partnership of the White House Millennium Council, the National
Park Service and the National Trust or Historic Preservation.

football games, declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court
last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although we, along with most of the people across the nation
are disappointed with the ruling, in keeping with the district's
pattern, we will comply with the ruling,'' school board president
Denise Cowart said after Thursday night's vote, the Galveston
County Daily News reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The policy had allowed students to deliver ''a brief invocation
and/or message'' over a speaker before football games.
</P>
<P>
   The case originated in Santa Fe in 1995 and resulted in a 6-3
Supreme Court ruling last month that bars students from leading
stadium crowds in meditation but could go much further to restrict
prayer in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that a school that gives students the public
forum for prayer is effectively sponsoring the message.

<HEADLINE> Family members say they hope mother's death sends message on domestic violence </HEADLINE>
By SUZANNE GAMBOA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) - Family, supporters and prosecutors say they
hope the slaying of Sheila Bellush and the guilty verdict against
her ex-husband send a message about the horrors of domestic
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Blackthorne, 45, who became rich from inventing a muscle
stimulator, is facing life in prison without parole after a federal
jury convicted him Thursday of arranging the murder of Bellush, his
ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
   The jury convicted him on charges of interstate conspiracy to
commit murder-for-hire and a charge of interstate domestic
violence. He faces sentencing Nov. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ''This case is about domestic violence,'' U.S. Attorney Bill
Blagg said in January when indictments against Blackthorne were
unsealed. ''We don't live in caves any more. Women aren't
possessions. They have rights. They are human beings. In this case,
we are talking about brutality, violence and death.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellush's husband, Jamie, who now lives in Sussex County, N.J.,
recalled that statement after the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no doubt about it,'' he said. ''The federal government
took a stand ... and said this kind of treatment will not be
tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Bellush, 35, was slain in Sarasota, Fla., in 1997. She
had been shot in the cheek, and her throat had been slit.
</P>
<P>
   Her body was discovered by her 13-year-old daughter, Stevie,
from her marriage to Blackthorne. Her quadruplets from her second
marriage were crawling in her blood. They were unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   ''My mother is dead,'' a sobbing Stevie Bellush was heard saying
on a 911 tape played during the three-week trial.
</P>
<P>
   To win a conviction, prosecutors portrayed Blackthorne as a man
who hated his ex-wife and who, after a string of custody battles,
turned the hatred into a scheme to have her killed. Attorneys said
Blackthorne offered $54,000 for the murder, with a bonus if he
regained custody of their two daughters, who had been adopted by
Bellush's second husband.
</P>
<P>
   Although they were not allowed to use it at trial, Blagg said
that when Blackthorne was arrested on the murder-for-hire charge,
the detention order included a Bexar County conviction for assault
and bodily injury of Bellush and a California conviction on
battery, both in September 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe there's a very strong message that (domestic
violence is) going to get acted on,'' Blagg said. ''Even against
someone who is wealthy and has resources like Allen Blackthorne,
it's going to get pursued vigorously.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackthorne retired after making a fortune selling medical
devices. His firm, International Rehabilitative Sciences, sells
muscle stimulators under the name RS Medical. It is based in
Vancouver, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   His lead defense attorney, Richard Lubin, with Blackthorne's
wife Maureen at his side, said in a news conference following the
verdict that he will appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt that there was more than reasonable doubt. A great
injustice has been done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Blackthorne's conviction Thursday came only a few hours after
Jose Luis Del Toro Jr. pleaded guilty in Sarasota to fatally
shooting and stabbing Bellush. After entering the plea, Del Toro
sang a song in court asking for forgiveness. A Florida judge
sentenced him to life in prison with no parole. He was given a
second consecutive life term for armed burglary of her home.
</P>
<P>
   The man convicted of hiring him, his cousin Sammy Gonzales, has
been sentenced to 19 years in prison. Daniel Rocha, Blackthorne's
golfing buddy and the man who asked Gonzales to find someone to
kill or harm Bellush, is serving life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Bellush and Blackthorne divorced in 1989. The two went through a
bitter divorce and hostile custody disputes involving their
daughters. Prosecutors said each time Bellush won increased child
support payments or restrictions on Blackthorne's visitation
rights, he became more enraged and determined to get revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Bellush tried to rid herself of him by moving to Florida, but
Blackthorne hunted her down, prosecutors said. Six weeks after she
moved, Bellush was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tragic story for everyone involved,'' Jamie Bellush
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bellush's stepfather, Don Smith, hoped the slaying of his
stepdaughter would send a message to women in domestic violence
situations.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you live with a man that does those kinds of things, get
rid of him as soon as you can,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 2 Kids Die in Nicaragua Earthquake  </HEADLINE>
By FILADELFO ALEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   VALLE LA LAGUNA, Nicaragua (AP) -- An earthquake shook Nicaragua
on Thursday, killing two children, injuring dozens and damaging
homes in several poor villages east of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 5.9, was
centered in Laguna de Apoyo, about 30 miles east of the capital
Managua, the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies said.
</P>
<P>
   An 11-year-old girl and a 4-year-old boy died when a house wall
fell on them, Nicaraguan Vice President Enrique Bolanos said.
</P>
<P>
   The earthquake was felt across the country, but deaths and
injuries apparently were limited to Valle La Laguna, a small hamlet
25 miles east of the capital of Managua.
</P>
<P>
   ''Never before had I felt an earthquake like this,'' said
90-year-old Elvira Gallegos.
</P>
<P>
   Army helicopters evacuated five of the 31 injured, while
firefighters and the Red Cross rescued 26 others after clearing
rock and trees away from a blocked highway leading into the town.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of houses, mostly unstable cement and adobe structures,
were damaged and some were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   In San Juan de Oriente, a town of about 5,000, residents ran
into the streets, clutching their belongings and bracing for
aftershocks, which came shortly after the first tremors.
</P>
<P>
   The town's church and some houses suffered minor damage. Roof
tiles were shaken off and statues fell in the cemetery.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Battle in Nevada  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN RILEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) -- Last week, two guards from an armored
car company delivered $100,000 to Ed Bernstein outside a Reno drug
company. He promptly dumped the cash on a table, saying it equaled
the amount his opponent in Nevada's U.S. Senate race has taken from
the pharmaceutical industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let me show you how much $100,000 is,'' declared Bernstein, a
Democrat from Las Vegas. ''This drug industry money stands against
working families, against seniors, against Americans getting
affordable prescription drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Theater? Definitely. Will it help Bernstein in his battle
against Republican John Ensign? Even top Democrats are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats trail Republicans 55-45 in the Senate. Democrats hope
to post wins in several states this fall, including New York, New
Jersey, Nebraska and Florida. But Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., has expressed doubts about a Bernstein victory in
Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein, 50, a millionaire personal injury attorney, has been
trailing in the polls. The most recent shows Ensign, 42, a wealthy
veterinarian and former two-term congressman, up by 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates, who are seeking the Senate the seat held by
retiring Democrat Richard Bryan, are starkly different.
</P>
<P>
   Ensign is an evangelical Christian who opposes abortion and
efforts to legalize gay marriages. He has participated in events
held by Promise Keepers, a men-only Christian group, and had a 100
percent approval rating from the Christian Coalition while in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He said his conservative stands on key issues play well with
Nevada voters. His proposals to rein in bureaucracy include cutting
federal involvement in states' education programs.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein is Jewish and studies Eastern religions. He's pushing
for health care reform and supports abortion rights, including what
opponents call the ''partial birth'' procedure if necessary for the
health of the mother.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein has tried to make the cost of prescription drugs a
major issue. He recently led an entourage of senior citizens to
Tijuana, Mexico to buy prescription drugs for a fraction of what
they cost in the United States. He followed up with the
money-dumping stunt at Merck &AMP; Co., using his own cash.
</P>
<P>
   Ensign accused Bernstein of ''an ugly personal attack that has
no place in politics.'' He has also cited his 1996 vote against a
$10.5 billion tax credit for pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein and other Democrats like to point to comments Ensign
has made, including one to a partisan crowd in Elko that ''most of
what the United States government does is unconstitutional.'' The
remark prompted the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to
call him a ''lunatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have their own fodder. Bernstein described himself
as a cross between Madonna and the Dalai Lama, later explaining
they're two people who grow and search for new ways to improve.
That hasn't stopped the GOP hooting.
</P>
<P>
   If Ensign and Bernstein agree on anything, it's strong
opposition to federal efforts to put a nuclear waste dump in
Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein can point to President Clinton's vetoes and threats to
veto dump-related measures. Vice President Al Gore has said he's in
step with Clinton on the issue, a big one in this tourist-dependent
state.
</P>
<P>
   The Ensign camp hasn't been able to produce a clear anti-dump
statement from GOP presidential hopeful George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Jelen, head of the political science department at the
University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said Bernstein is a long shot
because of his late start in the campaign. Jelen said there is an
''aura of inevitability'' around Ensign, who challenged Sen. Harry
Reid, D-Nev., in 1998 and lost by just 428 votes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Something has to happen relatively quickly,'' Jelen said.
''It's really unusual to see someone make up a lot of ground in
October.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein remains confident even though he's the underdog. He
said Daschle's view of the Nevada race is based on probable results
if an election was held now, not November.
</P>
<P>
   Ensign, the son of a prominent gambling industry executive,
isn't gloating about his lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't relax,'' he said. ''We're running like we're 10
points down. In politics, no lead is safe.''

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Set For Missile Test  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is counting down to a rocket
launch Friday night that could change the course of U.S. defense
policy and present the next president with one of the most
contentious international arms control debates in decades.
</P>
<P>
   Although much is riding on the outcome the test of a national
missile defense, Defense Secretary William Cohen is trying to tamp
down expectations by saying it is not a make-or-break event.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, some missile defense critics agree. Regardless of
the outcome, they believe President Clinton will move forward with
building a nationwide shield against missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen stressed that the test, the last before Clinton makes his
decision, is only one in a series of more than a dozen that will
ultimately determine the feasibility of defending all 50 states
against a limited attack of ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying to take it step by step because it's very, very
difficult technology we are trying,'' Cohen told reporters Thursday
in Tampa, Fla., where he presided over a change of command ceremony
at U.S. Central Command.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the missile defense system is to destroy a hostile
warhead in space by ramming it head-on with an interceptor missile.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying to hit a bullet with a bullet,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics believe the technology is not feasible and that the
Pentagon's testing methods are fatally flawed. Other critics say
that even if it worked the weapon would not be worth the
international outcry against it -- most notably Russia's threat to
unravel other arms control treaties.
</P>
<P>
   ''Recent statements by Defense Secretary William Cohen indicate
that the Clinton administration is on a path toward approval
regardless of allied skepticism,'' the British American Security
Information Council said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario for Friday's test is similar to that of the last,
unsuccessful test in January: a target missile -- a Minuteman
intercontinental ballistic missile with a dummy warhead -- launches
from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. Twenty minutes later, the
interceptor rocket takes off from Kwajalein Atoll in the remote
Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean. If it works as designed, a
''kill vehicle'' will detach from the interceptor rocket and guide
itself into the path of the dummy warhead, destroying it by force
of impact 144 miles above the earth.
</P>
<P>
   The test, scheduled for as early as 10 p.m. EDT, depending on
weather, has drawn unusually close attention around the world
because it could set the stage for Clinton to give the go-ahead for
building a full-scale missile defense. The one being tested uses
prototype interceptors and radars.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he will await Cohen's recommendation, several
weeks after the test, based on the Pentagon's assessment of the
technical feasibility and cost of the project. The Pentagon has
said a system using 100 interceptor missiles would cost about $36
billion, but a more robust system with multiple intercept bases and
additional missile detection capabilities would run tens of
billions more.
</P>
<P>
   An independent panel of retired military officers and weapons
experts told the Pentagon in a report last month that it believes
missile defense is technologically feasible, but that the Pentagon
may not be able to have a reliable system in place by 2005, the
target date. The date is significant because the CIA has said it
believes North Korea could have a long-range missile capable of
reaching U.S. soil within five years.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential
nominee, favors Clinton's go-slow approach to missile defense,
whereas his Republican challenger, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, says
he would push for the earliest possible deployment of an even
broader missile defense system, even if it meant abandoning the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, which prohibits national
missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   In Tampa, Cohen said he plans to discuss the U.S. plan with
China's leaders when he travels to Beijing next week. China and
Russia are outspoken opponents of the project. Both argue that
deploying a U.S. missile defense would trigger a renewed arms race
and undermine global stability.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said Clinton will take China's views into account when he
makes his decision this summer or fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ultimately I think any president has to look at this situation
and say, 'Can I afford to let the American people go undefended?'''
Cohen said. The United States now has no way of stopping a
long-range missile in flight.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Cold War, the United States assumed that the
Soviet Union would not launch a missile attack because it knew the
United States would retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the concern is that a smaller state like communist North
Korea might launch a small number of missiles at the United States.
The administration fears that North Korea -- and possibly Iraq and
Iran at some point -- would be less rational than Soviet leaders
were in considering the likelihood of U.S. retaliation.

<HEADLINE> Starr Spokesman Charged for Leaks  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN SOLOMON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kenneth Starr's former spokesman faces trial
next week in a battle over news leaks during the Monica Lewinsky
investigation that until now was fought mostly in secret.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal contempt trial of Charles Bakaly, who is being
prosecuted by the government, is to begin Thursday, according to
documents unsealed at the U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents show that Bakaly requested that the trial be
held in public and that the case be unsealed. That request was
granted last week by U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson,
who as the chief judge of the federal court in Washington oversees
matters involving grand jury secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly faces trial over statements he made concerning
investigations into alleged leaks from the special prosecutor's
office during President Clinton's impeachment ordeal, according to
the documents.
</P>
<P>
   The documents made public so far don't specify the exact reason
why Bakaly was charged with contempt. But officials have said, and
court documents show, that Bakaly was accused by his own office of
having a role in a January 1999 news leak during Clinton's
impeachment trial. He denied being the source of the leak.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who presided over most of the legal cases during the
Lewinsky impeachment drama, solicited the views of Clinton's
lawyers and Starr's successor, Robert Ray, as to whether sealed
documents in the case should be made public at Bakaly's trial.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly was unavailable for comment, his wife said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is the latest twist in a case spurred by Clinton's
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   During the height of the impeachment investigation, the
president's attorneys launched a legal assault accusing Starr and
his staff of illegally leaking to the news media information
covered by federal grand jury secrecy rules about the Lewinsky
case.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's office denied any illegal leaks, but his staff was
forced to undergo an intense investigation directed by the court.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of that investigation, Bakaly abruptly resigned in
March 1999 as Starr's spokesman after his former boss referred him
to the Justice Department in connection with a press leak two
months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times, citing unidentified sources, reported on
Jan. 31, 1999, that Starr had concluded the president could legally
be indicted while still in office.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly went on national television the day after the article
appeared and said the ''information did not come from our office.
... We did not leak this information. ... We do not leak grand jury
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr made the referral to the Justice Department after his
office conducted its own inquiry and concluded Bakaly may have been
involved in the leak, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents last fall showed Starr's office took
administrative action against Bakaly and informed the court it was
withdrawing its earlier denial that the prosecutor's office was the
source of the January 1999 leak. Instead, it argued the information
in the story was not covered by grand jury rules.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson ultimately concluded there was evidence that Starr's
office may have been behind as many as two dozen improper leaks.
Starr appealed, and won a key ruling from an appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the appeals court sided with Starr in
concluding the information in the Times article was not covered by
grand jury secrecy and thus was not an improper leak.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly, however, was forced to face the criminal contempt
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly, a bespectacled lawyer, defended Starr against an
onslaught of criticism as spokesman for the independent counsel's
office during the Lewinsky drama.
</P>
<P>
   He was the official who announced from the steps of the Capitol
that Starr had sent a referral to Congress alleging that Clinton
may have committed impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining Starr's office, Bakaly acted as spokesman for
Independent Counsel Donald Smaltz's investigation of former
Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy.
</P>
<P>
   He is the second major figure in the impeachment drama to face
contempt charges.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was accused of civil contempt by a federal judge for
false statements in the Paula Jones case and ordered to pay a fine.
The Arkansas Supreme Court's lawyers committee is trying to strip
the president of his law license.

becomes one of America's official national monuments on Friday. In a visit to
the cottage, President Clinton is to sign a proclamation designating the
157-year-old landmark as President Lincoln and Soldiers' Home National Monument.
Each summer from 1862 to 1864, Lincoln and his wife escaped the heat and
humidity of the White House by taking up residence at the cottage, about three
miles from the White House. The 14-room home, built in an early gothic revival

close at 10,481.47. The Nasdaq was up 97.07 at 3,960.17.

<HEADLINE> Move OK'd To Prolong Milosevic Rule  </HEADLINE>
By MISHA SAVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Montenegro issued a thinly veiled
threat to secede from the Yugoslav federation after the Yugoslav
parliament changed its constitution to strengthen President
Slobodan Milosevic's hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   By changing the constitution, the parliament -- dominated by
president's allies -- paved the way for Milosevic's re-election when
his term expires next year.
</P>
<P>
   The amendments passed Thursday call for the Yugoslav president
to be elected by popular vote, allowing Milosevic to run for a
second term, and for direct election of representatives to the
upper house of the Yugoslav parliament.
</P>
<P>
   After the votes, Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic warned
that Milosevic's regime had destroyed the federal constitutional
system.
</P>
<P>
   ''Therefore, Montenegro will have to find mechanisms to protect
itself from such constitutional and legal violence, through its
parliament and with the support from its citizens,'' a statement
from Djukanovic's office said.
</P>
<P>
   The Parliament of Montenegro, Serbia's much smaller partner in
the Yugoslav federation, was to meet Friday to discuss the
constitutional changes designed to perpetuate the Balkan
strongman's hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   While Djukanovic did not call for outright independence, other
senior Montenegrin officials speaking before him indicated that the
amendments enacted in Belgrade could quicken the pace.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tomorrow Montenegro's parliament will declare a moratorium on
today's decisions, which will not be valid in Montenegro,'' Miodrag
Vukovic, a senior adviser to Djukanovic, said of the parliament's
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since this amounts to the constitution of a new country,
Montenegro is now forced into making inevitable moves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro's reformist leadership has thus far refrained from
declaring full independence, fearing a possible armed conflict with
Milosevic's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the upper house includes 20 deputies from Serbia and
20 from Montenegro, all chosen by both republics' parliaments. If
the deputies are directly elected, Montenegrin candidates would
stand little chance of winning -- their republic has only 600,000
people, compared with Serbia's 10 million.
</P>
<P>
   The other amendment approved Thursday calls for the Yugoslav
president to be elected by popular vote, rather than by assembly
members, as was the case when Milosevic was appointed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The lower chamber passed the changes 95-7, while the vote in the
upper chamber was 27-0.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's allies argued that direct election would confer
''the greatest possible democratic legitimacy'' to the institution
of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is in the interest of the citizens of Serbia and
Montenegro and our joint state,'' Milutin Stojkovic, a deputy from
the president's ruling Socialist Party, said during the
parliamentary debate.
</P>
<P>
   But an opposition deputy, Vladeta Jankovic, told parliament that
''instead of us all respecting the constitution, we are having the
whole constitution adjusted to serve the interests of one man.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Milosevic's popularity is believed to have plummeted
since last year's NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, he is still in full
control of the media and state institutions, diminishing opposition
chances for a fair election race.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has been indicted by an international war crimes
tribunal for atrocities committed during his crackdown in Serbia's
Kosovo province, which triggered last year's 78-day NATO bombing
campaign. Staying in power would be Milosevic's best guarantee
against prosecution.

<HEADLINE> Many Voters Still Undecided  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Who's undecided about the presidential
election? Whether it's one in 20 or one in three depends on the
poll and how much people were pushed to make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   No matter the percentages, Marilyn Epperson isn't crazy about
either of the top candidates, Vice President Al Gore, the Democrat,
and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not leaning for Al Gore because of all the Clinton things,
and the other one is just dull to me,'' said the 56-year-old
retired school board member from Louisville, Ky., who considers
herself independent. ''It's up to me to listen more so I can make
up my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Some pollsters say nudging voters toward a decision often yields
more reliable results.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a high correlation between actual voting behavior and
what they tell you when you force the undecideds,'' said Frank
Newport, executive editor of the Gallup Poll. ''The behavior you're
trying to learn is the behavior of a voter who is forced to pull a
lever.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gallup poll shows about one in 20 undecided when it offers
four candidates -- Gore, Bush, Reform Party contender Pat Buchanan
and Green Party candidate Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for the People
and the Press, agreed that pushing people to make a decision can
provide more meaningful results.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you don't push, you find a lot of people who won't make up
their minds even close to the election,'' he said. ''And exit polls
show that most people make up their minds earlier than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some political analysts say the level of uncertainty is really
higher than reflected in many polls.
</P>
<P>
   ''The other polls present a picture of an electorate that is
misleading in that almost everyone out there has a pretty clear
preference,'' said Thomas Patterson, a Harvard researcher who is
measuring public interest in the campaign during his yearlong
''Vanishing Voter'' project.
</P>
<P>
   ''They get a 'top-of-mind' response. We're not saying that
response is invalid, but it greatly overestimates the number of
people who have a true preference,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his surveys, Patterson, a professor of government and the
press, phrases the presidential preference question differently,
asking: ''Which presidential candidate do you support at this time,
or haven't you picked a candidate yet?''
</P>
<P>
   When asked with the stated option of undecided, more than half
in the latest Vanishing Voter poll said they haven't made a choice,
about a fifth said they're for Bush and another fifth said Gore.
When asked how they leaned, the undecided number dropped to a
third.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Stuart Rothenberg said pollsters have to press
for a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think you have 33 percent of the public that doesn't
have an inkling,'' he said. ''There's a balance. You nudge them,
but you don't force them to make an artificial choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson's belief is that many people are far from decided and
that the upcoming political conventions will go a long way toward
clarifying the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the point where many will make a choice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Patterson's poll of 1,000 adults taken June 28 through July
2, Democrats were more likely than Republicans to be undecided -- 35
percent to 22 percent. Among independents, 41 percent were
undecided. The error margin is plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Jenkins, an independent from Reston, La., said it's too
early to decide.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only time I have to pay attention to such things is when I
don't have my kids,'' said the 38-year-old mother of two, who only
hears about the candidates ''when other people talk about them.''
</P>
<P>
   While generally satisfied with the choices, Jenkins said she
won't start thinking seriously about the election until the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Bissonette, of Biddeford, Maine, says he is a Democrat who
is unimpressed by either candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The 39-year-old pipefitter said he doesn't like Republicans
''because they're more for the rich, and I'm a middle-class kind of
guy.'' He also isn't impressed by Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm getting weird vibes about both of them,'' Bissonette said.
''They just say what they think people want to hear them say to get
elected.''

<HEADLINE> Protestant March Nixed in N. Ireland  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Protestant militants rallied
across Northern Ireland for a fifth straight night in frustration
at being denied the right to parade through the main Catholic
section of Portadown.
</P>
<P>
   Following heavy criticism from many quarters over the week's
violent clashes in the British province, road blocades and other
protests remained largely peaceful Friday -- a shift attributed in
part to the imminent funeral of a revered Protestant sports star.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50,000 mourners were expected to attend services
Friday afternoon for Joey Dunlop, the Ulster-born motorcycling
daredevil who won five world racing championships before suffering
a fatal crash last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   His death and legacy have competed for local headlines all week
alongside the riots. His grieving family and Orange Order leaders
appealed Thursday for a halt to the violence before his funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ''I make this genuine plea to everyone: Let's remember the great
ambassador for Northern Ireland, Joey Dunlop. Let's have a quiet
day,'' said Robert Saulters, grand master of the Orange Order,
Northern Ireland's major Protestant fraternal group, whose
summertime marches always raise sectarian passions.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of this week's violence-prone Orange protests --
triggered when British authorities told Orangemen they could not
parade this Sunday past hostile Catholics on Portadown's Garvaghy
Road -- hoped Saulters' appeal represented a newfound determination
to deter troublemakers. They responded to the Orange Order's call
last weekend for mass protests by attacking police and soldiers
with bricks, firecrackers and gasoline bombs.
</P>
<P>
   But many fear that Friday could be the lull before another storm
of street confrontations. Saulters and other Orange leaders remain
set on defying Sunday's parade restrictions in Portadown, where
police and soldiers since 1998 have blocked their annual march from
reaching Garvaghy Road.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just getting rested up for the weekend,'' quipped Johnny
McCullough, a Protestant teen-ager who said he'd taken part in
Belfast riots for three nights straight.
</P>
<P>
   Early Friday he was sipping alcoholic cider with friends on a
tattered old sofa left on a sidewalk by rioters. Two units of
police sat nearby eating sandwiches in the backs of their armored
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier that night in a nearby house, police had seized crates
of bottles and a tin of gasoline -- the building blocks for
potentially lethal Molotov cocktails.
</P>
<P>
   ''But there's plenty more bottles than peelers (police) in
Belfast,'' McCullough said, predicting, ''The weekend's going to be
wild.''
</P>
<P>
   And the climax of Orange marching plans won't come until
Wednesday, the so-called Twelfth holiday. Tens of thousands of
Protestants are expected to parade throughout Northern Ireland to
commemorate the 1690 defeat of Catholic King James II at the hands
of Protestant William of Orange.
</P>
<P>
   British authorities on Thursday ordered one Belfast parade
rerouted away from a hostile Catholic district, but two other
disputed Twelfth parades opposed by Catholics were given approval.
That compromise set the stage for possible protests by hard-liners
from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Thursday they had arrested 43 Protestant rioters
during 109 attacks on police and army units this week. Thirty-two
police officers and one soldier were wounded. At least 37 houses,
mostly Catholic-owned, had been attacked, while 34 vehicles were
hijacked and burned.

<HEADLINE> Angels 5, Mariners 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Mo Vaughn and Tim Salmon homered and
Jarrod Washburn pitched five shutout innings to lead the Anaheim
Angels to a 5-1 victory over the Seattle Mariners on Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn (5-2) held the team with the fewest hits in the AL to
three singles and a double to ruin the Mariners' bid to win 10
consecutive series.
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander, who took a no-hitter into the seventh against
Oakland in his previous start, struck out five and walked three and
allowed fewer than three runs for the fifth time in six outings.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, who haven't been shutout since opening day against
Boston, did not get a runner to third base until the eighth when
one-out singles by Edgar Martinez off Mike Fyhrie and John Olerud
off Mike Holtz put runners at the corners. Jay Buhner lined Mark
Petkovsek's first pitch to left field to drive in Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   After preventing the Mariners from scoring in the first inning
for the first time in their four-game split, the Angels took the
lead against Paul Abbott (5-3) in the bottom of the first on
Vaughn's two-out solo homer to center field. It was his 22nd of the
season and his team-high 64th RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad drew a leadoff walk in the third and scored on
Salmon's two-out homer to center for a 3-0 lead. Salmon's 18 homers
are one more than he hit in 98 games last season, when he missed 2&AMP;frac12;
months because of a sprained left wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Spiezio, starting at third base because of first-time
All-Star Troy Glaus' 1-for-29 drought, increased the lead to 5-0 in
the sixth with a bases-loaded two-run single that chased Abbott.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander was charged with five runs, five hits and five
walks in 5 1-3 innings, after going 4-0 with a 2.13 ERA in his
previous six starts.
</P>
<P>
   The loss reduced Seattle's lead in the AL West to three games
over Oakland. It also marked the first time the Mariners failed to
win a series since May 29-31, when they lost two of three to
Chicago at Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Rickey Henderson drew his 2,019th career walk in the fifth
inning to tie Ted Williams for the second-most walks in major
league history. Babe Ruth tops the list with 2,062. ... Angels LHP
Kent Mercker, hospitalized for 12 days after a cerebral hemorrhage
forced him out of his May 11 start, passed a stress test on
Wednesday after last week's angiogram came back negative. ''I'm
planning on pitching in July,'' said Mercker, who returned to the
Angels' clubhouse last Friday for the first time. ''In my mind, I'm
done being monitored. I've been going crazy sitting around and not
being able to do anything.'' ... Glaus batted for Orlando Palmeiro
in the seventh and walked. ... Mariners CF Mike Cameron was a late
scratch because of stiffness in his right knee. ... Angels RHP Tim
Belcher was placed on the 15-day DL because of a strained right
flexor muscle in his elbow -- the same injury that forced him to
undergo surgery last December.

<HEADLINE> Trade Talks Won't Divide Democrats  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE FARROW
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Reaching an agreement on trade language won't
be easy, but Democrats working on party policy for the next four
years insist it's possible.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin said at a hearing Thursday to draft
the party's platform that the issue continues to divide Democrats.
But he also said he was certain that the committee would be able to
reach some consensus when it meets Friday to draft the document on
issues, goals and policies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won't gloss over it, there will be some differences,'' said
Durbin, who co-chairs the platform committee.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Blinder, an adviser to Vice President Al Gore and a former
Federal Reserve vice chairman, urged the drafting committee to
embrace open trade.
</P>
<P>
   ''America gets cheaper, better and more preferred goods and that
raises the standard of living,'' said Blinder, now a professor of
economics at Princeton University.
</P>
<P>
   He was among some 50 witnesses who addressed the committee
Thursday at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. Members will use
those comments when they draft the platform that will be discussed
later this month in Cleveland. The document will then go before the
national convention in Los Angeles, which begins Aug. 14, for
approval.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's simply not true -- and history speaks clearly to this --
that open trade causes unemployment,'' Blinder said. ''Imports have
soared in America over the last four years, growing at an
annualized real growth rate in excess of 12 percent. Yet during
this exact period unemployment has fallen and we have created 15
million new jobs in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Durbin said Democrats would work with unions to
ensure any policy on trade includes safeguards to protect American
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt, who chairs the drafting committee,
suggested there would be no platform surprises for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''My sense is that much of this is what he has already had to
say and what he has already proposed,'' Hunt said. ''I think this
is a platform he can run on and he can win on.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, committee members heard from Mary Leigh Blek,
president of the Million Mom March, who urged them to stand strong
on gun control. There was no discussion of the death penalty, which
has become an issue nationwide and which Gore supports. Durbin said
the committee had discussed the death penalty on its own before the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Blek, a Republican, told the committee she has been disappointed
by the GOP's efforts to block gun control measures in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   She wants gun owners to take safety classes and be held
accountable if their guns are used for harm.
</P>
<P>
   Durbin said he was pleased by Blek's appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm thrilled to have a lady come forward who started the
Million Mom March, and tell us she's a registered Republican but
when it comes to gun safety she knows this is the party that takes
it seriously,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Maury, president of the Business Roundtable, an association
of corporate chief executives, advised the committee on what to do
with one result of the economic prosperity -- the sizable federal
budget surplus. He suggested using some of it to give business
owners a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion, however, raised the ire of Hunt and committee
member Christopher Edley Jr., a professor at Harvard Law School.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm disappointed you focused on using the surplus to cut
taxes,'' Edley told Maury. ''I'd urge the Business Round-table not
to be attached to tax cuts, but to make investments in education.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the witnesses present Thursday, the platform
drafting committee received comments from 1,600 people who
submitted them to the Web site SpeakOut.com.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt said it was the first time a major political party had
allowed citizens to electronically submit their ideas and
suggestions for a platform.

<HEADLINE> Feds Propose Mining Rules  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ZUCKERBROD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government would assume more
responsibility at underground coal mines under proposed new rules
aimed at reducing black-lung disease.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for overhauling the system for sampling,
detecting and controlling dust in mines. It was made public
Thursday and comes after the United Mine Workers of America filed a
lawsuit seeking changes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Underground coal miners must have confidence that the system
being used to test the air they breath is producing accurate
results,'' Labor Secretary Alexis M. Herman said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, mine operators are responsible for sampling dust
levels. They submit the samples to the Labor Department's Mine
Safety Health Administration, which determines whether miners are
overexposed to the kind of dust that can cause black lung and other
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   For years, miners and their advocates have charged that
companies failed to accurately measure dust or doctored their
samples to meet government standards.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new proposal, the federal government will be
responsible for taking samples. About 100 federal inspectors are
expected to be hired to help with that task.
</P>
<P>
   ''This gets away from the fox guarding the hen house problem,''
said Davitt McAteer, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety
and health.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 86,000 U.S. coal miners working primarily in
Wyoming, West Virginia and Kentucky. The government estimates about
1,400 current or former miners die each year of black-lung disease.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Watzman, vice president of safety and health for the
National Mining Association, said the companies are ready to rid
themselves of sampling duties.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really a no-win proposition for the operators today,''
Watzman said, noting that companies are suspected of cheating
whenever the findings meet government regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed changes, to be published Friday in the Federal
Register, adopt recommendations by an advisory committee that
included mining industry and labor representatives. Under the plan:
</P>
<P>
   --The Mine Safety Health Administration would verify the
effectiveness of mine operators' dust-control measures. No
verification now is required.
</P>
<P>
   --Dust samples, collected six times per year, will be taken
during entire shifts. Now, the samples generally are collected over
eight-hour periods, although miners often work 10 and 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   --Inspectors will analyze dust levels in each area where miners
work. Currently, sample results from different parts of a mine are
averaged and do not take into account working in a specific area
breathing extremely dusty air.
</P>
<P>
   --Miners' representatives may observe the sampling.
</P>
<P>
   The United Mine Workers reacted cautiously to the proposed
changes. Joe Main, health and safety administrator for the union,
said he wanted to review them before commenting.
</P>
<P>
   Main said the lawsuit, which is still pending, prompted the
latest government action.
</P>
<P>
   But McAteer denied that, saying the proposal has been in the
works for five years.
</P>
<P>
   A public comment period on the proposal is expected to last
until Aug. 24, after which the rules will be finalized.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Settlement Loan Unsettled  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY DUNPHY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- World Bank directors try again Friday to
decide whether to approve a $40 million loan that would move poor
Chinese farmers to traditionally Tibetan lands after failing to
reach agreement in 6&AMP;frac12; hours of talks.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's board of directors spent much of Thursday reviewing
the project, which is opposed by the United States and pro-Tibetan
forces. But they were unable to reach a decision and will resume
talks Friday, bank officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Bank managers have proposed another 15 to 18 months of social
and environmental studies in an effort to get a green light for the
project from the 24-member board, said the officials, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, the bank's major shareholder, along with
other governments that oppose the loan, want these studies to be
made public. And Bank President James Wolfensohn had recommended a
delay while the studies are carried out.
</P>
<P>
   But China and other borrowing governments are resisting, said
one person familiar with the talks.
</P>
<P>
   China is reluctant to see teams of international consultants
making repeated visits to the remote area in western Qinghai
province where the farmers would be resettled. China has a seat on
the 24-member bank board that will make the final decision on the
project.
</P>
<P>
   Under bank procedure, such project studies usually are released
after a loan is approved. The United States also wants another vote
on the project taken after the studies are completed.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-Tibetan opponents of the loan said the fact the directors
were unable to agree is a good sign.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a reflection of the divisiveness of the project,''
said John Acklerly of the International Campaign for Tibet. ''Such
disagreements are rare at the World Bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the loan would be used to resettle 58,000
impoverished Chinese and Hui Muslim farmers in lands that are the
traditional homeland for 4,000 Tibetan and Mongol herders.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-Tibetan groups contend resettlement would aid China's effort
to dilute its minority Tibetan population. Tibet's exiled spiritual
leader, the Dalai Lama, said last month after a meeting with
President Clinton that the bank initiative ''would be a source of
more problems'' and should not proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Several protesters from the Campaign for Tibet camped out in
front of bank headquarters for the fourth day Thursday, calling for
cancellation of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups object to the part of the plan that would
underwrite construction of dams and irrigation canals in the
resettlement area.
</P>
<P>
   China insisted last week the project is supported by those who
would be relocated and by the Tibetans living in the province. The
Beijing government said the initiative would also raise living
standards and would strictly adhered to Chinese and World Bank
requirements.

<HEADLINE> Educators Key Backers in Election  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Curtis Rock, an elementary school teacher in
Foley, Minn., wants to help elect Al Gore president but concedes it
won't be easy, even if a majority of some 3&AMP;frac12; million teachers
follow up on their union leaders' embrace of the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ''Making an endorsement isn't enough,'' said Rock, a Democrat
who will spend the summer telling others in his small town how the
vice president's education platform is more important than the
Clinton administration scandals that Republicans are trying to tar
him with. ''We have to provide reasons to back it up.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, the nation's two major teachers' unions officially
threw their weight -- and potentially hundreds of thousands of
political activists -- behind Gore. The larger group, the National
Education Association, has 2.5 million members, or nearly 1 in 100
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The NEA and the American Federation of Teachers, with about 1
million members, are political forces in states with hot
congressional races, ballot initiatives and the potential to turn
the presidential contest. Michigan, with a school voucher
initiative and competitive Senate race on its ballot, has 183,000
union teachers who could be stumping for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is no longer a year where you can sit back and say 'Oh
well,''' said Regina Finch, who has taught 26 years in Harford
County, Md. ''Teachers had better get involved in this election
because anything that affects the country affects the educational
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Rock, she's spending the summer ''answering questions from
fellow teachers about why I support Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Teachers take the time to get involved,'' Rock said,
acknowledging that being off for three months as most of them are
makes it easier. ''It's a perfect time that leads us into the fall
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Rock lives in a community of 2,000, where he says educators'
opinions are still respected by other residents because ''teachers
will do the research.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers supporting Texas Gov. George W. Bush are speaking up,
too. A minority among the delegations this week at the NEA's
convention here and at the AFT gathering in Philadelphia, spoke out
against Gore's anointment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he's choosing topics to gain favor of educators
because we have such a big union,'' Judy Bruns, a middle school
teacher from Coldwater, Ohio, said of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the expected Republican presidential nominee, is not only
strong on education, she said, but he also is the candidate for
Republican teachers or those who base their vote on socially
conservative issues like abortion, religion and gun owners' rights.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Nowak, a retired teacher from Buffalo, N.Y., said
despite the overwhelming exuberation for Gore at the NEA meeting, a
growing minority of teachers this summer will swim against the
tide.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will not tear Bush down because he was not endorsed by the
NEA,'' said Nowak, who taught 34 years in Buffalo and is active in
Republican politics there.
</P>
<P>
   NEA President Bob Chase has said his union is endorsing more GOP
candidates this year in races for governor and seats in Congress.
But he said a GOP presidential candidate has never completed the
union's questionnaire and interview process required for
endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   NEA members voted this week to increase their union dues $5 a
year to help fight voter initiatives in Michigan and California and
efforts in state legislatures elsewhere on behalf of the government
providing vouchers to children to attend private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Rock, who's taught in public schools for 15 years and in private
schools for five, believes the voucher issue has mobilized many
educators in this election.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really believe if a private education is wanted, private
funds should take care of it,'' Rock said. ''Having been in both
worlds, I can say that pretty strongly.''

<HEADLINE> Mexico's Fox Promises More Openess  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- More interaction, less presidentialism and
greater honesty. That's what Vicente Fox says he'll use to change
the aloof style of the Mexican presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Never one to shun a microphone, President-elect Fox said in a
televised interview Thursday that ''we are going to have a couple
of conferences a week,'' as well as ''interviews everyday.''
</P>
<P>
   Outgoing President Ernesto Zedillo held only a few news
conferences during his six-year term. He promised regular briefings
when he first took office, then quickly dropped the idea.
</P>
<P>
   In the first three days after his victory, Fox seems to have
been everywhere, giving dozens of interviews. At times, both
national television networks were broadcasting separate interviews
with him at the same time -- one live, one taped.
</P>
<P>
   Fox even has appeared on the top two prime-time comedy shows of
the national Televisa network. He called to jokingly threaten
comedian Adal Ramones on Tuesday after a satirical piece on Fox. A
day later, Fox was on television ''interviewing'' Armando Hoyos -- a
comic intellectual played by Eugenio Derbez.
</P>
<P>
   Fox ''is his own chief of public relations,'' adviser Jorge
Castaneda told the Radio Red network Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While Zedillo tends to appear in stiff and scripted television
addresses, Fox is far more relaxed, often gesticulating with his
hands and absent-mindedly massaging his cowboy boots.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo, however, had been a relatively reserved economist --
never a politician -- before running for the presidency and seemed
uncomfortable when faced with tough or silly questions.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, naturally garrulous, has been running campaigns almost
constantly since 1990 as an opposition candidate. More often than
not, he has dealt with pro-government news media opposed to him.
</P>
<P>
   That may have fed his desire to grab whatever space he could get
in the press or on the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   When he was elected governor of Guanajuato state in 1995, Fox
spoke to reporters -- local, national and foreign -- for hours in a
hotel in the state capital of Leon.
</P>
<P>
   Some reporters left to report other stories and returned several
hours later to find Fox still sitting and talking. Even then, he
made little secret he was seeking the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's constant appearances on television and on the radio also
have a clear purpose: to ease the fears and confusion of Mexicans
who have never before experienced a leader who was not from the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   He also has promised to tour the country to listen to local
concerns and assure former foes that he will not take revenge.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate who referred to PRI as a haven of ''scorpions,''
''black snakes'' and ''toads'' has dramatically softened his tone.
</P>
<P>
   He promised Thursday that federal workers -- most of them PRI
members -- will be retained so long as they accept changes in
culture that include greater honesty and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anybody who adapts to that will be there for six years,'' the
length of the presidential term, he said in the Televisa interview.
</P>
<P>
   He also repeated his vow to keep a distance from his National
Action Party, or PAN. The outgoing party historically existed to
serve the presidents it put in power.
</P>
<P>
   He also vowed to be a less-dominant leader in a country
accustomed to presidents who were near-dictators.
</P>
<P>
   ''Presidentialism ended with me. It has radically ended,'' Fox
said in a long interview published Thursday by the left-leaning
newspaper La Jornada -- which generally had been hostile to his
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am going to be a president who serves.''

<HEADLINE> Barak To Offer Concessions At Summit  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak will arrive
at the U.S.-sponsored Mideast summit next week prepared to offer
the Palestinians an expanded presence in a reshaped Jerusalem along
with admission of thousands of refugees whose families already live
in Israel, according to two well-placed Israeli officials.
</P>
<P>
   Stressing the concessions must be matched by conciliatory
Palestinian moves, the officials said Thursday the future of
Jerusalem was the toughest issue on the table and may be excluded
from a settlement between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Less progress has been made on Jerusalem than any other issue in
the negotiations leading up to the summit President Clinton will
stage beginning Tuesday at Camp David, Md. By contrast, the two
sides have made considerable headway on the question of how much
land Israel will turn over to Yasser Arafat for a state, said the
officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, for instance, may not insist on retaining the strategic
Jordan Valley, provided Israel can maintain a security presence
there at least for some time, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual disclosure of Barak's likely stance on core issues
at the summit appeared to be part of an effort to project him as a
reasonable Israeli leader and to coax matching concessions from
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, at least, the Palestinian leader is demanding transfer
of virtually all of the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem -- more
land than Barak is prepared to relinquish. And Barak intends to
keep Jerusalem united and Israel's capital, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak is prepared to consider expanding areas of the city
already under day-to-day Arab control in exchange for incorporating
nearby Jewish settlements into the predominantly Jewish area of the
city, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On refugees, Barak is willing to consider permitting tens of
thousands of Palestinians to settle in Israel if they have family
members there, but he will not accept the idea they have a legal
right to return, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The precedent is Israel's acceptance of 60,000 to 70,000
Palestinian Arabs in a program of reuniting families that was in
force between Israel's founding in 1948 and the Mideast war of
1967, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of today's refugees would be absorbed in the
Palestinian state, while others would receive assistance under a
worldwide funding campaign.
</P>
<P>
   East Jerusalem was occupied by Jordan before it was captured by
Israeli troops in the 1967 Mideast war and reunited with the
predominantly Jewish Western part of the ancient city.
</P>
<P>
   In Arab neighborhoods, Palestinians already run their day-to-day
affairs. This area can be expanded beyond Jerusalem's current
boundaries to incorporate predominantly Arab areas, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   But they stressed that was contingent on Israel absorbing into
the city some of the nearby suburbs now on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything about Jerusalem is on the table, everything is
discussable,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   Concern about Barak's possible concessions led two Israeli
political parties to announce this week they were quitting his
government.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright continued her
campaign to rally Arab and Jewish support for the summit,
</P>
<P>
   She met with Foreign Minister Habib ben Yahia of Tunisia and
spoke on the telephone with King Mohammed of Morocco, the State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said. Also, Albright met with
a coalition of American Arab groups and, separately, with members
of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish
Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he hopes the summit could conclude in a few
days. Palestinian officials said Thursday a two-stage summit was
under consideration, with the second round in August.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli officials said that approach had been discussed with
the Palestinians and the U.S. hosts. But a U.S. official, speaking
on condition of anonymity, denied that and said Washington wants to
reach an accord in one stage.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are due in Washington this
weekend for pre-summit talks on Sunday and Monday, and Albright
plans to meet with them, Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Boucher assured Tokyo that Albright was skipping
a high-level conference next week in Japan only because of the
urgency of Mideast talks.
</P>
<P>
   Albright explained to Foreign Minister Yohei Kono in a half-hour
telephone call why she would not attend the foreign ministers
meeting and he ''expressed his understanding of the critical timing
of the Middle East peace talks,'' Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign ministers of Britain, Canada, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan and Russia are due to meet at Miyazaki on July 12-13
to prepare for a Group of Eight summit meeting on Okinawa July
21-23.

<HEADLINE> Advice Offered For Bull Running  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL WOOLLS
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAMPLONA, Spain (AP) -- Safety tip No. 1 for running with
1,500-pound bulls bred to be quick, ornery and relentless: don't
yell at them.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, don't do anything that has even the slightest chance of
distracting the hulking beasts which are the star attraction of
Spain's most internationally known summer event, the San Fermin
Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans of the half-mile course, which winds through narrow
streets in Pamplona's old quarter, say that despite all the
drinking and merriment that goes on almost nonstop for eight days,
they take their running very seriously.
</P>
<P>
   After all, 13 people have died at San Fermin since
record-keeping started in 1924.
</P>
<P>
   ''This not a game,'' said Cesar Garro, a 29-year-old auto
factory worker who has run in the last six festivals. ''The streets
belong to the bull.''
</P>
<P>
   They rule the streets for two or three minutes, if all goes
well, starting at 8 a.m. sharp each morning for a week, as six
fighting bulls are freed from a corral and rumble down a fenced
route to a bullring where they will face matadors and certain death
by afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the runners sport the traditional festival garb of white
shirt, white pants, red bandanna and red sash around the waist.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all carry rolled up newspapers. One idea is that if a
friend falls and a bull attacks, you throw the paper to the ground
so it will unfurl and distract the bull. In fact, some foolhardy
runners use the paper to tap bulls on the rump.
</P>
<P>
   During the run, the animals are accompanied by steers which are
supposed to serve as guides, keeping the bulls more or less in a
cluster.
</P>
<P>
   But many things can and do go wrong. Hoofs provide poor traction
on cobblestone, so sometimes the bulls slip and fall, particularly
at one rather sharp turn about midway through the run.
</P>
<P>
   A fallen bull is even more dangerous. Separated from the herd,
he gets up confused and may run in the wrong direction. Seeing
nothing but people instead of fellow bulls, the toro can get
nervous and charge.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting bulls are amazingly agile for their size. In bullfights
they sometimes leap over a 5-foot-tall wooden fence that surrounds
the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Making things worse, human thrill-seekers also fall at San
Fermin. The festival has become so popular and the runs so crowded
that, veterans say, half the trick is to be aware of who or what is
nearby as you sprint, trying to see in all directions at once.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of many novices among the estimated 2,000 people
who take part in each run poses another risk. ''I've seen people
running with backpacks, or running while shooting video cameras,''
said Garro.
</P>
<P>
   He and other veterans insist that another important rule of San
Fermin is that if you fall, don't get up. Curl up, cover your head
with your arms and just hope you don't get trampled or gored, they
say.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you get up, there's a 90 percent chance something will go
wrong,'' said Inigo Etxeberria, 28.
</P>
<P>
   He said the last person gored to death at San Fermin, Matthew
Tassio, 22, of Glen Ellyn, Ill., made the mistake of getting up
after he went down in front of the Pamplona town hall in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bull never even changed direction. It just barreled right
into him,'' Etxeeberria said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they remain on their feet, runners can keep up with the
bulls for only five or six seconds because the animals are so fast.
Veterans compare the experience to merging into fast-moving traffic
on a highway, then trying to get off quickly.
</P>
<P>
   If you do it right, for a few Adrenalin-fueled seconds you're
close enough to the bull to smell it, to hear its raspy pant. ''It
sounds like a locomotive engine,'' Etxeberria said.
</P>
<P>
   Runners choose different stretches of the route for their brief
run. All are considered dangerous, although for different reasons.
Many daredevil veterans prefer the opening 200 yards or so, a steep
hill leading up and away from the corral.
</P>
<P>
   It's risky because the street is particularly narrow, the bulls
are fresh and they are running their fastest -- bulls move better
uphill than downhill because their front legs are shorter than
their hind legs.

<HEADLINE> Kodak: Air emissions down at Rochester facility  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Eastman Kodak Co.'s annual report to the
U-S Environmental Protection Agency claimed the photographic giant
has continued to reduce the amount of chemicals released into the
air.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures released by the company, there has been a
16 percent decline in chemical emissions last year at Kodak Park in
Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 percent drop in toxic emissions in 1999 marks the 11th
straight annual drop in the figure, which companies nationwide must
file with government regulators by July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak's releases into the Rochester area's air, water and land
totaled 5.2 million pounds last year. The total has fallen 75
percent since 1987, the first year for which reports were required.
</P>
<P>
   The company has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on
environmental protection and cleanup here since the late 1980s, and
has paid several million dollars in fines to federal and state
regulators for various infractions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the marked reductions in its toxic releases, Kodak Park
in Rochester has been ranked the state's largest polluter and is a
frequent target of environmental critics.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported Thursday that air releases of the chemical
that critics focus on most often - methylene chloride, a solvent
used in film-base manufacture - dropped 17.6 percent last year
compared with the year before. Releases of the possible human
carcinogen totaled 1.4 million pounds.

Gore Campaign To Focus on Women
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Capping an effort to energize core Democrats, Vice
President Al Gore says he'll fight for ''every woman in the land'' by pushing
his agenda for health care reform. In making the case, the presumptive
Democratic presidential nominee notes that women pay more for prescription
drugs, live longer and earn less than men, and have higher overall health costs,
making them the biggest winner under his proposal to bolster Medicare. Gore is
wrapping up the fourth -- and final -- week of his ''prosperity and progress
tour'' where he's sought to claim credit for the nation's robust economy while
also seeking to reshape the campaign debate into a discussion of how to spend
the projected budget surplus.

decades. Although much is riding on the outcome the test of a national missile
defense, Defense Secretary William Cohen is trying to tamp down expectations by
saying it is not a make-or-break event. Cohen stressed that the test, the last
before Clinton makes his decision, is only one in a series of more than a dozen
that will ultimately determine the feasibility of defending all 50 states
against a limited attack of ballistic missiles.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Tries New Drug Eradication  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Colombia has agreed to work with the U.N. Drug
Control Agency on field testing a fungicide that some experts
believe has great potential for eradicating narcotics plants.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Thursday the
fungicide is expected be tested over a two-year period and then
''it will be up to the government of Colombia to evaluate the
results and determine the next steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombian Environmental Minister Juan Mayr said the tests will
be conducted outside of Colombia ''because any agent foreign to the
native ecosystems of our country could present grave risks to the
environment and human health.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement, issued by his office in Bogota, was in a letter
to The New York Times, which first reported the planned tests on
Thursday. Mayr claimed his remarks had been misinterpreted.
</P>
<P>
   Mayr was quoted by the Times as saying in an interview: ''What
we want is a program of research -- and only research -- on the use
of biological controls against these crops.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates say the fungicide, known as fusarium oxysporum, could
be the answer in the long search for a means of reversing what has
been a steady growth in the production of coca leaf and opium poppy
in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian drug cartels have been able to offset extensive
chemical spraying by opening up new areas for cultivating narcotics
plants.
</P>
<P>
   The proponents say a big advantage of the fungus is that it
grows naturally, is safe for the environment, and that decades must
pass before a treated area is suitable again for growing narcotics
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Department tests have shown that the fungus will
kill narcotics plants without harming other plants or animal life,
advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   ''These micro-organisms have the potential to cripple drug crops
before they are even harvested,'' one proponent, Republican Sen.
Mike DeWine of Ohio, has said.
</P>
<P>
   DeWine was unavailable for comment on Thursday, but an aide said
the Colombia decision was ''a positive step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said there will be other hurdles to clear if the tests show the
product is feasible.
</P>
<P>
   The next problem would be to find a way to produce the fungicide
in quantities that will yield the desired results. In addition, a
delivery mechanism has to be found, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have become increasingly alarmed about
the repeated failure of an extensive eradication program to reverse
what they call an ''explosion'' in coca production in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   A CIA estimate in January showed a substantial increase in coca
cultivation, and there is no reason to believe the next estimate,
due in January 2001, will not show another increase, the State
Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress recently approved legislation to provide $1.3 billion
to Colombia to fight narcotraffickers and the insurgents who
protect the drug trade.

<HEADLINE> Korean Arms Broker Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A court on Friday convicted a
Korean-American of bribing officials for classified information
about a military contract and sentenced her to a year in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Kim, 47-year-old consultant for E-Systems Inc. of Plano,
Texas, was arrested immediately after the court ruling and sent to
serve the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Kim was found guilty of illegally lobbying former defense
officials in order to win the military's $210 million project to
buy surveillance gear. Seoul awarded part of the project to
E-Systems in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A former two-star general, Kwon Ki-dae, who was in charge of the
project was found guilty of taking $10,000 in bribes from the
broker and sentenced to a suspended 10-month jail term.
</P>
<P>
   Since the government opened an investigation in 1998, three arms
dealers and four colonels have been convicted of illegally handing
over classified information to the broker relating to the project.
</P>
<P>
   All of them were given suspended prison terms and released.
</P>
<P>
   The broker voluntarily returned to South Korea to face
questioning in March.

<HEADLINE> Body of Erving's Son May Be Found  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE SCHNEIDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANFORD, Fla. (AP) -- The car of Cory Erving was pulled out of a
pond Thursday and authorities said a body found inside appears to
be that of the troubled 19-year-old son of basketball great Julius
''Dr. J'' Erving.
</P>
<P>
   ''The body does fit the description of Cory Erving, including
clothing,'' Sheriff Don Eslinger said. An autopsy will be performed
Friday, but no foul play was suspected.
</P>
<P>
   ''The family has been notified,'' Eslinger said. ''They're
devastated.''
</P>
<P>
   The pond is not far from the Erving home and investigators
believe the car has been in the water since Erving disappeared
Memorial Day weekend. The pond is at the end of a dirt path near
the Erving family's gated community in suburban Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   The car was found 20 yards from shore in about 8 feet of water.
The car's windows were up and the interior was filled with water.
The driver's side seat belt was not fastened, Eslinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Cory Erving disappeared May 28 on what was supposed to be a
20-minute shopping trip to buy bread for a family picnic.
</P>
<P>
   His father went public June 13, asking for help in finding his
son, who had a history of drug and alcohol abuse as well as run-ins
with the law. Julius Erving said one of Cory's friends claimed Cory
had been using marijuana and ''roofies'' -- a slang term for the
illegal sedative Rohypnol -- the night before he disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   A $50,000 reward was offered for his safe return. But despite
more than three weeks of national media exposure, there was no sign
of Cory or his black 1999 Volkswagen Passat until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Cory had been working at a sandwich shop and taking courses
geared toward getting a high school equivalency diploma. Despite
his past troubles, Cory's family believed he had turned his life
around.
</P>
<P>
   Cory was last seen at a mall in Lake Mary, about 20 miles north
of downtown Orlando. Authorities said he had little money and they
considered him ''endangered.''
</P>
<P>
   Erving, at news conferences pleading for help, said Cory was
born with a learning disability that he described as a mild form of
dyslexia and attention deficit disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Erving, a Hall of Famer and former NBA MVP with the Philadelphia
76ers, revolutionized basketball with his high-flying slam dunks
and was one of the sport's biggest stars. His 16-year career ended
in 1987. He is the executive vice president of the Orlando Magic.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our prayers are with Julius and the family at this time,''
Magic spokesman Joel Glass said. 'He's a member of our family and
we're all grieving at the news.''
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, fans who followed Erving's career were stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you see public figures like that, you always think their
lives are perfect,'' said Shawn Bury, 30, a security guard. ''You
saw how he got on the air and asked people for help.... Suddenly,
he became an average person.''
</P>
<P>
   Another fan recalled the 1997 slaying of Ennis Cosby, which
devastated Germantown, Pa., native Bill Cosby.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bill Cosby was always the fatherly figure, and Dr. J. just did
his business on the court -- he wasn't a troublemaker,'' said Ross
Wayman, 45, of Wilkes-Barre, Pa., who was visiting Philadelphia on
business. ''It just makes it that much harder to believe it could
happen.''

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Considers China Visit  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- If the government allows Mayor Frank Hseih
to go to China next week, the head of Taiwan's second-largest city
will become one of the most prominent politicians to visit the
mainland since the two territories split amid civil war 51 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hseih, mayor of Kaosiung, Taiwan's biggest port, said Friday
that the laws restricting top leaders from freely traveling to
China should not apply to him. The government was expected to
decide later in the day whether Hsieh could go.
</P>
<P>
   Although hundreds of Taiwanese tourists and investors visit
China daily, the island's laws do not allow officials in sensitive
positions -- including ministers and vice ministers in the Cabinet --
to freely travel to China.
</P>
<P>
   However, the law is not clear about whether the mayors of
Taiwan's two largest cities, Taipei and Kaohsiung, need government
permission to go to China.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Hsieh, a former attorney, argued that the law could
not prevent him from traveling to China and that his trip would
merely be a city-to-city exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ''Talking directly is better than talking indirectly,'' he told
reporters in Kaohsiung. ''Understanding is better than
misunderstanding. Goodwill is better than war.''
</P>
<P>
   Hsieh's proposed trip would come at a sensitive time.
China-Taiwan relations have been especially tense since Taiwanese
President Chen Shui-bian's March election upset ended more than
five decades of Nationalist Party rule on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the significance of the mayor's proposed visit, Hsieh
was recently elected chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party,
whose members include the president.
</P>
<P>
   Hsieh announced this week that Xiamen Mayor Zhu Yayan had sent
him an informal letter inviting him to visit. Hsieh said he
immediately accepted the invitation and wanted to travel to China
on July 10-13 before he takes over as the DPP's chairman on July
22.
</P>
<P>
   Kaohsiung is across the Taiwan Strait from Xiamen, which is a
key outlet for exported goods made by Taiwanese-owned mainland
factories.
</P>
<P>
   Premier Tang Fei and the Mainland Affairs Council, which handles
Taiwan's China policy, on Friday were determining whether Hsieh's
proposed trip to the southern city of Xiamen would be legal, said
Lin Chong-pin, the council's vice chairman.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Stock Market Opens July 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- Vietnam will launch its long-awaited stock
market in Ho Chi Minh City on July 20 but so far only two companies
are listed, State Securities Commission Chairman Nguyen Duc Quang
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The government has been planning a stock exchange for several
years, but had postponed the launch because of a lack of companies
willing to list and concerns the market will expose Vietnam's
financial system to unnecessary risk.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Ho Chi Minh City-based Refrigeration Electrical
Engineering and the Cables and Telecommunications Materials
joint-stock company in neighboring Dong Nai province have been
licensed to list their shares.
</P>
<P>
   But the government says the main source of commodities for the
exchange floor will be government bonds, bank bonds and project
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Quang told Dow Jones Newswires Friday he hopes several more
companies will be approved before the market's launch.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 400 of some 5,900 state-owned enterprises have been
privatized under a government program launched seven years ago in
hopes of mobilizing public savings, believed to total billions of
dollars. That has become increasingly important with a slowdown in
foreign investment.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Set For Missile Test  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is counting down to a rocket
launch Friday night that could change the course of U.S. defense
policy and present the next president with one of the most
contentious international arms control debates in decades.
</P>
<P>
   Although much is riding on the outcome the test of a national
missile defense, Defense Secretary William Cohen is trying to tamp
down expectations by saying it is not a make-or-break event.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, some missile defense critics agree. Regardless of
the outcome, they believe President Clinton will move forward with
building a nationwide shield against missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen stressed that the test, the last before Clinton makes his
decision, is only one in a series of more than a dozen that will
ultimately determine the feasibility of defending all 50 states
against a limited attack of ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying to take it step by step because it's very, very
difficult technology we are trying,'' Cohen told reporters Thursday
in Tampa, Fla., where he presided over a change of command ceremony
at U.S. Central Command.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the missile defense system is to destroy a hostile
warhead in space by ramming it head-on with an interceptor missile.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying to hit a bullet with a bullet,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics believe the technology is not feasible and that the
Pentagon's testing methods are fatally flawed. Other critics say
that even if it worked the weapon would not be worth the
international outcry against it -- most notably Russia's threat to
unravel other arms control treaties.
</P>
<P>
   ''Recent statements by Defense Secretary William Cohen indicate
that the Clinton administration is on a path toward approval
regardless of allied skepticism,'' the British American Security
Information Council said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario for Friday's test is similar to that of the last,
unsuccessful test in January: a target missile -- a Minuteman
intercontinental ballistic missile with a dummy warhead -- launches
from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. Twenty minutes later, the
interceptor rocket takes off from Kwajalein Atoll in the remote
Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean. If it works as designed, a
''kill vehicle'' will detach from the interceptor rocket and guide
itself into the path of the dummy warhead, destroying it by force
of impact 144 miles above the earth.
</P>
<P>
   The test, scheduled for as early as 10 p.m. EDT, depending on
weather, has drawn unusually close attention around the world
because it could set the stage for Clinton to give the go-ahead for
building a full-scale missile defense. The one being tested uses
prototype interceptors and radars.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he will await Cohen's recommendation, several
weeks after the test, based on the Pentagon's assessment of the
technical feasibility and cost of the project. The Pentagon has
said a system using 100 interceptor missiles would cost about $36
billion, but a more robust system with multiple intercept bases and
additional missile detection capabilities would run tens of
billions more.
</P>
<P>
   An independent panel of retired military officers and weapons
experts told the Pentagon in a report last month that it believes
missile defense is technologically feasible, but that the Pentagon
may not be able to have a reliable system in place by 2005, the
target date. The date is significant because the CIA has said it
believes North Korea could have a long-range missile capable of
reaching U.S. soil within five years.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential
nominee, favors Clinton's go-slow approach to missile defense,
whereas his Republican challenger, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, says
he would push for the earliest possible deployment of an even
broader missile defense system, even if it meant abandoning the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, which prohibits national
missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   In Tampa, Cohen said he plans to discuss the U.S. plan with
China's leaders when he travels to Beijing next week. China and
Russia are outspoken opponents of the project. Both argue that
deploying a U.S. missile defense would trigger a renewed arms race
and undermine global stability.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Yakovlev, the head of Russia's Strategic Rocket Forces,
was quoted by the Interfax news agency Friday as saying the tests
''are the first step toward global nuclear instability.''
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. missile defense system, he said, would ''lead directly to
nuclear anarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said Clinton will take China's views into account when he
makes his decision this summer or fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ultimately I think any president has to look at this situation
and say, 'Can I afford to let the American people go undefended?'''
Cohen said. The United States now has no way of stopping a
long-range missile in flight.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Cold War, the United States assumed that the
Soviet Union would not launch a missile attack because it knew the
United States would retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the concern is that a smaller state like communist North
Korea might launch a small number of missiles at the United States.
The administration fears that North Korea -- and possibly Iraq and
Iran at some point -- would be less rational than Soviet leaders
were in considering the likelihood of U.S. retaliation.

<HEADLINE> Singer Bobby Brown Released  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   POMPANO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Singer Bobby Brown was released from
jail early Friday after getting 10 days' credit for good behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 33, had been sentenced to 75 days behind bars after
repeatedly violating his parole on a 1996 drunk driving conviction.
He attended a drug rehabilitation program while in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was picked up outside the North Broward Detention Center
by his wife, pop star Whitney Houston, in a long, white limo. She
jumped into his arms while comedian Chris Rock led a group of
supporters in a mock vigil for a bit on his HBO show.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's beautiful out here,'' Brown yelled as he embraced Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just want to be with my family and my friends,'' Brown said.
''I'm going home to spend the summer with my kids and work on my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown was first arrested in 1996 after he crashed his wife's
black Porsche 911 into a signpost on Ocean Drive in Hollywood. His
blood-alcohol level was nearly three times the legal limit.
</P>
<P>
   Brown spent five days in jail in 1998 and was placed on
probation for one year. A warrant for Brown was issued last June
after his probation officer said the singer tested positive for
cocaine, and he was arrested two months ago at the airport in
Newark, N.J.

<HEADLINE> Activists Try To Stop Missile Test  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) -- Anti-nuclear activists
were hoping to halt Friday evening's test of a national missile
defense system by positioning a ship in an area of the Pacific
where a rocket stage is expected to splash down.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace planned to station a vessel about 110 miles offshore
from Vandenberg Air Force Base, said Steve Shallhorn, campaign
director for Greenpeace USA.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has asked pilots and mariners to avoid the area
during the test or risk damage or injury but said the test could
continue even with a ship in the zone.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think Star Wars is a step in the wrong direction. It's
going to make the world a more unstable place,'' Shallhorn said.
''We're sending a message to President Clinton asking him to take a
finger off the Star Wars button and cancel the program.''
</P>
<P>
   The $100 million test called for a Minuteman II missile to be
launched at 7:01 p.m. PDT and be destroyed over the ocean about 20
minutes later by an interceptor launched from the South Pacific.
One previous test succeeded and the other failed.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the technology is not advanced enough to work and
could lead to another arms race. Supporters argue the system, if
deployed, could protect all 50 states from long-range nuclear
missiles launched by rogue nations such as North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has yet to make a decision on whether to deploy the
system.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three people from more than a dozen nations were aboard
Greenpeace's 164-foot Arctic Sunrise, the ship being stationed in
the hazard zone in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Master Sgt. Tyler Foster, a Vandenberg spokesman, said
the test could continue even with the vessel there.
</P>
<P>
   ''Quite frankly, our launch commander can make the determination
to launch even if there is a boat in the zone,'' Foster said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace activists also set up camp outside Vandenberg's main
gate, about 180 miles northwest of Los Angeles. And a group of
protesters not affiliated with Greenpeace threatened to delay the
launch by breaking into the base.

about 180 miles northwest of Los Angeles. And a group of protesters
not affiliated with Greenpeace threatened to delay the launch by
breaking into the base
</P>
<P>
   The scenario for Friday's test is similar to that of the last,
unsuccessful test in January: a target missile -- a Minuteman
intercontinental ballistic missile with a dummy warhead -- launches
from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. Twenty minutes later, the
interceptor rocket takes off from Kwajalein Atoll in the remote
Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean. If it works as designed, a
''kill vehicle'' will detach from the interceptor rocket and guide
itself into the path of the dummy warhead, destroying it by force
of impact 144 miles above the earth.
</P>
<P>
   The test, scheduled for as early as 10 p.m. EDT, depending on
weather, has drawn unusually close attention around the world
because it could set the stage for Clinton to give the go-ahead for
building a full-scale missile defense. The one being tested uses
prototype interceptors and radars.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he will await Cohen's recommendation, several
weeks after the test, based on the Pentagon's assessment of the
technical feasibility and cost of the project. The Pentagon has
said a system using 100 interceptor missiles would cost about $36
billion, but a more robust system with multiple intercept bases and
additional missile detection capabilities would run tens of
billions more.
</P>
<P>
   An independent panel of retired military officers and weapons
experts told the Pentagon in a report last month that it believes
missile defense is technologically feasible, but that the Pentagon
may not be able to have a reliable system in place by 2005, the
target date. The date is significant because the CIA has said it
believes North Korea could have a long-range missile capable of
reaching U.S. soil within five years.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential
nominee, favors Clinton's go-slow approach to missile defense,
whereas his Republican challenger, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, says
he would push for the earliest possible deployment of an even
broader missile defense system, even if it meant abandoning the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, which prohibits national
missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   In Tampa, Cohen said he plans to discuss the U.S. plan with
China's leaders when he travels to Beijing next week. China and
Russia are outspoken opponents of the project. Both argue that
deploying a U.S. missile defense would trigger a renewed arms race
and undermine global stability.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Yakovlev, the head of Russia's Strategic Rocket Forces,
was quoted by the Interfax news agency Friday as saying the tests
''are the first step toward global nuclear instability.''
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. missile defense system, he said, would ''lead directly to
nuclear anarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said Clinton will take China's views into account when he
makes his decision this summer or fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ultimately I think any president has to look at this situation
and say, 'Can I afford to let the American people go undefended?'''
Cohen said. The United States now has no way of stopping a
long-range missile in flight.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Cold War, the United States assumed that the
Soviet Union would not launch a missile attack because it knew the
United States would retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the concern is that a smaller state like communist North
Korea might launch a small number of missiles at the United States.
The administration fears that North Korea -- and possibly Iraq and
Iran at some point -- would be less rational than Soviet leaders
were in considering the likelihood of U.S. retaliation.

<HEADLINE> Book for Teens Wins Literary Prize  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A straight-talking book for teen-agers dealing
with adultery, euthanasia, and homosexuality bested publishing
phenomenon Harry Potter on Friday for a literary prize.
</P>
<P>
   ''Postcards From No Man's Land'' took the Carnegie Medal for its
65-year-old author Aidan Chambers, a former monk whose work is
aimed at those age 14 and up.
</P>
<P>
   ''At 15 people can handle the same language as me, they're just
as complicated as me and are very interested in thinking about
important questions for the first time,'' Chambers said.
</P>
<P>
   J.K. Rowling's ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' was
on the short list for the prize, but failed to win even a
commendation from the judges.
</P>
<P>
   Postcards is the fifth in a series of six books. It weaves
together the story of a 17-year-old youth's experiences in modern
Amsterdam and that of a dying Dutch woman who loved a married
English soldier during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers, who lives near Stroud in western England, was
surprised to win. ''The short list is so strong and my book is long
and complex,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people call it difficult, but I refuse to sell young
people short by compromising on language or subject matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Judges for the award, presented by the Library Association, said
the book ''poses crucial questions, and doesn't patronize by giving
easy answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Established in 1936, the Carnegie Medal has been awarded to some
of the great names in children's literature, including Arthur
Ransome and C.S. Lewis.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average is up 22 points
in today's early going. Advancing issues on the New York Stock
Exchange hold about a 3-2 lead over decliners.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index is ahead eleven points and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index is up three points.
</P>
<P>
   The financial markets can breathe a little easier now that the
government's June employment report has been released.
</P>
<P>
   The report did show a decline in the nation's jobless rate of
one-tenth of a percent.
</P>
<P>
   But it also pointed to more moderate economic growth, which may
help convince the Federal Reserve that it doesn't need any more
interest rate hikes.
</P>
<P>
   And that sort of scenario would be just fine with Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices are higher on today's economic data. But stocks have
failed to gain much momentum in European trading.

   Shortly after Wall Street's opening bell, the Dow Jones

</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department reported early Friday that total employment
rose by only 11,000 in June, the smallest increase in four years.
It was another sign that the economy has been cooling in response
to a series of interest rate increases from the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been hoping that the Fed may be nearly done with
its current campaign to fight back inflationary pressures and may
be ready to leave rates alone for the next several months.

<HEADLINE> Medical Firm Made Up Inmates' Tests  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Thousands of inmates were put at risk when
a medical lab faked results of tests for diseases like AIDS and
hepatitis, and there is little evidence the prisoners were retested
after the fraud was discovered, the San Francisco Chronicle
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   B.C.L. Clinical Labs tested inmates from at least seven
California prisons before health inspectors shut it down in 1997
after a surprise visit.
</P>
<P>
   The inspection found that the lab, in the Los Angeles suburb of
Santa Fe Springs, was filled with idle, shoddy equipment, and that
workers simply made up test results and typed them into a computer,
according to federal and state documents obtained by the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how many inmates may have falsely been found to be
free of AIDS or other diseases. Without retesting, the inmates
could have been released without knowing they had a serious or
potentially contagious condition.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they've got hepatitis or TB, they are spewing them around.
They are out in the mall,'' said Geoff Long, chief of staff for the
state Assembly's Appropriations Committee, who has worked on
corrections issues for 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Department of Health and Human Services revoked
B.C.L.'s license and fined the lab $20,000. Investigators believe
the company's owner and manager, Pareena Ahkter and her brother
Ayazur Rahman, fled the country shortly after the inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators notified seven state prisons in March 1997
that the lab problems could mean patients were in ''immediate
jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet since last March, when the Chronicle first inquired into the
matter, the state Department of Corrections has been unable to
produce records of new testing.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Donna Wilson of the Department's Health Care Services
division said she believes the state did retest. Medical officials
from one prison say they sent some test samples to be reprocessed
at local hospitals, though they could not provide documentation.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Corey Weinstein, a San Francisco physician who consults with
advocacy groups on prison medical issues, said it's unlikely that
every prison retested.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's not in the charts, it didn't happen,'' Weinstein said.
''Medical professionals are taught: You write everything down.''

<HEADLINE> Heart Surgeon Settles Bias Claim  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- A pioneer heart surgeon who sued the University
of Washington for sex discrimination has accepted a $750,000
settlement and resigned from the transplant program she founded.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement, Dr. Margaret Allen, 51, is also
barred from leading research tied to the medical school or its
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the sum we're paying, we're buying a complete divorce.
We're not having any shared custody,'' university attorney Michael
Madden said.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, one of the first female heart transplant surgeons, had
been at the university 15 years and called the settlement, reached
a week ago through binding arbitration, ''incredibly
discouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   She had complained that a supervisor, Dr. Edward Verrier, chief
of cardiac surgery, harangued her about her performance and removed
her as heart transplant director without explanation in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   She also conteneded the surgery department's acting director,
Dr. David Ashbaugh, told her she would never be promoted to full
professor because the department was like an ''old boys' club.''
Ashbaugh denies saying that and said he did all he could to help
Allen get promoted.
</P>
<P>
   Madden wrote in mediation documents that Allen alienated
anesthesiologists and others in the operating room, was too slow
and often changed direction and surgical schedules at the last
minute, forcing the staff to wait hours for her to begin surgery.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement, Verrier wished Allen well in her future
research.
</P>
<P>
   Allen is a past president of the United Network for Organ
Sharing, which is responsible for nationwide organ distribution.

<HEADLINE> Lincoln Summer Home To Be Monument  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Lincoln's summer retreat, a hilltop
cottage on the outskirts of Washington where he drafted the
Emancipation Proclamation, became one of America's national
monuments on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a visit to the cottage, President Clinton signed a
proclamation designating the 157-year-old landmark as President
Lincoln and Soldiers' Home National Monument.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is fragile, vital history in this house,'' Clinton said.
''Today, we come to reclaim it, to preserve it and to make it live
again -- not simply to honor those who came before and not only for
ourselves, but for generations yet to come who need to know how
those who lived here, lived and made the decisions they made at a
profoundly fateful time in our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also announced $15 million in grants by Save
America's Treasures -- including a $750,000 award for the cottage --
to preserve historic sites nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Each summer from 1862 to 1864, Lincoln and his wife escaped the
heat and humidity of the White House by taking up residence at the
cottage, about three miles from the White House. The 14-room home,
built in an early gothic revival style, remains much as it was in
Lincoln's day. He commuted there by horseback or carriage and often
read and relaxed beneath a copper beech tree that still stands
beside the house.
</P>
<P>
   The house is located on the grounds of what used to be called
Soldiers' Home, the first home for disabled veterans of the U.S.
Army. Part of the home now is being used as office space for the
Armed Forces Retirement Home, which manages the U.S. Soldiers' and
Airmen's Home.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln drafted the Emancipation Proclamation at the cottage in
September 1862 and last visited the home the day before his
assassination. The cottage also served as a summer retreat for
Presidents Buchanan, Hayes and Arthur.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was here where President Lincoln completed a draft of the
Emancipation Proclamation, which abolished slavery in the seceding
states,'' Clinton said. ''When he signed it, Lincoln said 'My whole
soul is in it.' You can still feel that spirit strongly in the room
in this cottage where he worked.''
</P>
<P>
   The grants are being awarded by Save America's Treasures, a
partnership of the White House Millennium Council, the National
Park Service and the National Trust or Historic Preservation.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavs Boiling Mad at Heat Wave  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- With temperatures in Kosovo and the
Balkans reaching record levels, shopkeeper Emin Bajraktari is
boiling mad.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is it hot -- there's no electricity and water supplies
are chancy at best.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of the lack of electricity, I can't operate my
refrigerator,'' the 38-year-old grocer fumed. ''I've had to throw
away meat because it spoiled. I'm losing hundreds of dollars every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   The record-setting Balkan heat wave has sent temperatures
soaring above 104 degrees in Kosovo, compounding already critical
problems of electricity and water supplies more than a year after
NATO and the United Nations took over the province from the Serbs
following a 78-day bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble started Tuesday when a 400-kilowatt line tripped,
forcing a shutdown of the 17-year-old, coal-fired power plant at
Obilic, just outside the capital Pristina. Workers couldn't restart
the faulty generator because one motor and the auxiliary
transformer failed.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Lindmeier, the spokesman for the European Union, which
oversees the plant, could not say Friday when repairs could be
made. In the worst case, he added, repairs could take months if the
transformer has to be sent to its manufacturer in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the prospect of a lengthy shutdown, workers tried to
start another generator at Obilic. That didn't work, because the
water container used to produce steam was leaking so badly. Crews
fired up yet another, but a pump failed and the whole system
collapsed at 3:25 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, the U.N. administration could import emergency power
from neighboring countries on the same Balkan regional grid. But
the heat wave has stretched supplies in Albania, Romania and
Bulgaria to the limit.
</P>
<P>
   Lindmeier said some additional power might be available from
Bulgaria next week. In order to power hospitals and other
high-priority locations, Kosovo is importing some electricity from
-- of all places -- Serbia. But its not enough to power homes and
offices.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the general collapse of infrastructure means there's
little people can do to beat the heat. Outdoor cafes cannot serve
coffee because the machines need power. The city's swimming pool
has closed to conserve water.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Ghedini, the spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency, said
people are being urged to drink more water. That's not so simple,
however, since the electricity shortage means pumps cannot get
water to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Most people in Pristina cannot count on running water for more
than a couple of hours each day.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions are even worse for the thousands of people who don't
even have a proper roof over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   On a hill in the village of Vukovc, about 20 miles west of the
capital, Hida Bogicici and 10 members of her family live in a tent
on the grounds of their home, which was destroyed in last year's
Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian militants.
</P>
<P>
   ''During the winter, we couldn't stay inside because rainwater
was always leaking into the tent,'' she said. ''Now, it's too hot
and with 11 people in one tent, it's too cramped. Mostly we stay
outside in the shade.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the European Union awarded a $40 million contract to
overhaul the Obilic unit, which failed Tuesday. But that doesn't
solve the immediate problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''Due to neglect of 10 or more years, if the whole system breaks
down, it takes a while to repair them,'' Lindmeier said.
</P>
<P>
   That is small comfort to the people of Kosovo, who -- right or
wrong -- expected everything to work once the United Nations and
NATO took over.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, when heat, electricity and water failed,
international agencies assured the public that things would get
better in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are all frustrated,'' said U.N. spokeswoman Nadia Younes.
''We're having a difficult time. It was a very cold winter,
unfortunately it is a very hot period in the summer.''

<HEADLINE> Putin Power Play Gets Mixed Results  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW KRAMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin won a battle in the lower
house of parliament and lost one in the upper house Friday in his
ambitious bid to strengthen his powers over Russia's regional
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The lower house, called the State Duma, voted 335 to 27 to
approve a law allowing Putin to fire local officials and mayors.
Three lawmakers abstained.
</P>
<P>
   The upper house, meanwhile, vetoed a bill that would let the
president dismiss governors who violate laws. The upper house,
called the Federation Council, is composed of regional governors
whose powers are threatened by Putin's plan. The vote was 83 to 16
against the bill, with nine abstentions.
</P>
<P>
   The measures were two of three draft laws Putin has proposed to
rein in the powers of provincial governors, who in recent years
have assumed wide authority -- in some cases nearly total -- in their
remote regions of the vast country. Wealthier regions are reluctant
to share revenues with the federal government, and some regional
leaders have suppressed dissent and independent media.
</P>
<P>
   The president describes his package of bills as a bid to force
regional bosses to comply with the country's 1993 constitution, but
critics say he is eliminating checks and balances on the
president's power.
</P>
<P>
   The Federation Council last week rejected the third measure,
which would have replaced governors in the upper chamber with
appointed senators. On Friday the upper house agreed to form a
joint commission with the Duma to work out a compromise on that
bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma voted Friday to accept this offer. If the compromise
fails the Duma can attempt to override the Federation Council's
veto with a two-thirds majority vote.
</P>
<P>
   The bills have driven a wedge between the two houses of
parliament. Their rocky road through the legislature has been the
first serious political blow to Putin, who was elected March 26 and
has vowed to bring order to Russia's unwieldy state machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Putin says that up to one-fifth of local laws contradict the
federal constitution. He says tightening control over the regions
is essential to dealing with Russia's economic problems and keeping
the country from falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   The law passed by the Duma on Friday lets Putin fire mayors and
district chiefs who, according to court rulings, have violated
federal laws. He could also dismiss local legislatures, but only
after a two-thirds vote by the Duma.
</P>
<P>
   Putin offered a consolation in the bill to the regional
governors whose powers he is trying to trim: The law gives
governors the right to dismiss mayors and local officials if courts
find they have violated the law.
</P>
<P>
   The bill now goes to the Federation Council, which is unlikely
to look favorably on these measures either, analysts have said.

<HEADLINE> Winds Cool Heat Wave in Europe  </HEADLINE>
By ELENA BECATOROS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Strong winds and a brief dip in
temperatures Friday brought some relief from a heat wave that has
scorched southeastern Europe and resulted in at least 38 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   But the dry winds also fanned hundreds of fires, and
meteorologists predicted weekend temperatures above 103 degrees in
places, with a second wave of hot air heading north from the Sahara
desert.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people around the region have sought medical
attention over the past week for respiratory conditions, heatstroke
and heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures, which for days reached as high as 113 across the
region, dropped by several degrees in most areas Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But there was little change in Turkey, where temperatures
continued to hover at around 109 in parts of the country. Seven
people, including a German tourist on a yacht in the Mediterranean
port town of Kas, reportedly died of heart attacks triggered by the
heat Friday, local media said.
</P>
<P>
   To the north in Romania, the country's nuclear power plant was
shut down after the heat inside the building rose to 158 and set
off sprinklers, a plant statement said Friday. Nobody was injured
and the plant was not damaged, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures in Romania have reached 111 over the last week,
leading to 14 deaths and touching off hundreds of fires. The heat
receded to 100, but was expected to rise steadily again over the
weekend to 104.
</P>
<P>
   In Greece, temperatures fell by nearly 13 degrees to settle at
100, but were expected to reach 106 by the end of the weekend.
Despite the drop in temperature, strong, dry winds fueled more than
100 forest and brush fires around the country beginning Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The largest fire consumed an estimated 4,000 acres of forest on
the Aegean island of Samos. The island's airport was shut after
flames reached the facility and burned dried grass in the area.
Eight firefighting aircraft and two helicopters were battling the
blaze despite gale-force winds.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of aircraft and hundreds of firefighters, soldiers and
civilian volunteers also battled large blazes on the nearby island
of Chios.
</P>
<P>
   Fires also burned in Italy, where a 57-year-old farmer died
after being engulfed by flames while trying to extinguish a blaze
in a field near his home near L'Aquila, 70 miles northeast of Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures hovered at around 93 in Italy but were expected to
increase Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions were significantly cooler in the Croatian capital of
Zagreb, at 82 in the late morning. Meteorologists forecast rain and
even lower temperatures over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Croatian counties had proclaimed a state of natural
disaster because of drought, saying their crops will be 40 to 70
percent lower than last year.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 20 blazes that burned in Croatia over the past days
were extinguished. But two fires broke out Friday in the hinterland
of the southern Croatian coast. Firefighters were unable to
approach the region as flames spread through areas that were mined
during the 1991 war.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Mourn Teens in Spain  </HEADLINE>
By KERNAN TURNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SORIA, Spain (AP) -- The Queen of Spain joined thousands of
mourners on a soccer field Friday in a funeral Mass for victims
killed when a livestock truck barreled into a bus carrying
teen-agers to summer camp, leaving 28 people dead.
</P>
<P>
   Golf carts and hearses delivered the polished wood caskets of 20
teen-agers and four adults to a red carpet on the artificial turf
of the Pajaritos municipal sports complex in this farming city.
</P>
<P>
   With black-banded flags of Spain and the regions of Castile and
Leon and Catalonia fluttering overhead, social workers led weeping
parents to chairs in front of the coffins. Queen Sophia shook hands
with some mourners, then sat with Spanish officials nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The bus had been carrying boys and girls aged 15-18 from two
religious schools outside Barcelona to a summer camp near the
central town of Aranda de Duero when the collision occurred
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The truck, loaded with live pigs, strayed out of its lane into
oncoming traffic and collided with the bus head-on, shearing along
its side and flipping it over into a deep ditch.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-seven people were killed on impact: 17 boys and three
girls, as well as the two drivers, four school monitors and the
mother of a teacher. A 13-year-old girl died Friday of severe brain
injuries suffered in the crash, hospital officials said. Twelve
others, including nine teens, were injured.
</P>
<P>
   ''The truck hit the side of the bus like a guillotine and killed
everybody that was traveling on that side,'' said Juan Jose Lucas,
president of the regional government of Castile and Leon, where
Soria is located, 125 miles northeast of Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a day of tremendous pain, specially when it deals with
young people who were going on holidays,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the dead school monitors were not among those
memorialized Friday. Two were Polish citizens and will have a
separate ceremony, Soria officials said. The third was reportedly
Portuguese. Services for the girl who died Friday will be held
later.
</P>
<P>
   After news of the accident, parents and relatives of the
students rushed from the Barcelona area, unsure if their children
were among the victims. Most arrived after midnight in Soria and
during the night, they looked through the bodies in a makeshift
morgue set up in another stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've taken my daughter from me. My God!'' one woman wailed
after finding her child among the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists and clergy, including Bishop Francisco Perez of
Soria, tried to comfort the parents as they identified the bodies.
Pope John Paul II sent a condolence message Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the victims were to be buried in the Barcelona area. The
two schools, Modolell de Viladecans and Sant Esteve, are located
just outside the city, located on Spain's eastern coast.

<HEADLINE> 'Potter' Hysteria Reaches England  </HEADLINE>
By AUDREY WOODS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- While truckloads of the top-secret ''Harry Potter
and the Goblet of Fire'' sped along Britain's highways Friday to
shops around the land, bookstores invited youngsters to bring
sleeping bags and await the first official sale -- at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before Harry Potter's new adventure burst upon a waiting
world, it was hard to tell who was more excited -- the book industry
or the throngs of youngsters whose genuine eagerness to read it
created a marketer's dream.
</P>
<P>
   But with the hefty new tome firmly in their grasp, the kids will
have the edge.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're really, REALLY looking forward to it,'' 11-year-old
friends Natasha Cook and Eva Arevuo said almost in unison Friday
afternoon at a Books Etc. branch in north London.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not so realistic that they're boring,'' Natasha said,
trying to explain the Potter books' appeal. The adventures of the
orphaned wizard, Harry, at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
Wizardry are filled with humor, suspense, monsters, ghosts and
magical characters.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's always got lots of surprises in it,'' Eva said.
</P>
<P>
   While waiting for the new book -- fourth in the series -- to go on
sale, children at Waterstone's bookshop in Piccadilly Circus were
given an ''I waited for Harry'' T-shirt and entertained by a
magician. Waterstone's shops in Glasgow, Scotland, and Birmingham
and Leeds, England, arranged sleepovers, too.
</P>
<P>
   Publicity-shy kids could pick up their books at another of the
chain's London shops, in South Kensington, which scheduled a
midnight-to-1 a.m. opening without so much hoopla. A stand-in for
Harry's owl Hedwig was promised.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Amazon.co.uk Internet site promised customers their
pre-ordered copies would go in the mail Friday, with the goal of
getting them delivered by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Staff at the company's Milton Keynes distribution center in
southern England worked through the night to ensure that about
65,000 copies were ready to ship.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon expects to send 53 tons, or 41.6 million pages worth, of
the book to British readers.
</P>
<P>
   Although it may not have the old-fashioned music of cash
registers ringing in its ears, the U.S. Amazon.com site had totted
up more than 300,000 sales -- more than six times the prepublication
record set in March by John Grisham's latest novel, ''The
Brethren.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' occupied the top spot on
the best seller lists of both sites.
</P>
<P>
   The first print run by the book's British and U.S. publishers
totaled 5.3 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   Author J.K. Rowling was too busy last year writing this book to
do much publicity for ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,''
the third book in the series.
</P>
<P>
   This time, she's doing book signings on a promotional tour that
sets off on a Hogwarts Express train from ''Platform 9 3/4'' at
King's Cross station, where the boy wizard and his friends embark
each year on their way to adventures.
</P>
<P>
   At 640 pages in Britain and 752 pages in the U.S. edition, the
new book is double the size of ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of
Azkaban,'' which was greeted with similar excitement when it was
released. It sold 64,000 copies in hardback in its first 2&AMP;frac12; days.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the U.S. bookstore chain Barnes and Noble said it
already had 360,000 pre-orders and expected to break records for
first-day and first-week sales for any book in the company's
history.
</P>
<P>
   Together, its retail stores and Web site already have received
more than 360,000 pre-orders, more than 10 times the number of
pre-orders for any previous book.
</P>
<P>
   Like Waterstone's in Britain, many Barnes and Noble stores are
staying open past midnight to accommodate fans, and planning
special parties with costumes and refreshments.

<HEADLINE> Mossad Spy Gets Suspended Sentence  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- A Swiss court handed a suspended
one-year sentence to an Israeli agent Friday, closing the book on a
bungled Mossad spy operation that embarrassed Israel and strained
relations with Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   The judgment allowed the agent, identified by the pseudonym
Issac Bental, to return immediately to Israel without serving any
more time in a Swiss prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''He violated the sovereignty of Switzerland in an unrestrained
and intolerable manner,'' chief judge Hans Wipraechtiger said.
</P>
<P>
   A tough verdict would likely have antagonized Israel. But
Wipraechtiger said the mild sentence was in line with decisions in
other espionage cases and appropriate for a first offense.
</P>
<P>
   ''We took pains to bring in no political aspects, although we
know of course that every verdict -- especially in this context --
cannot be free from politics,'' Wipraechtiger told The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   He said the five-judge panel of the Federal Criminal Court
''tried to look strictly at Mr. Bental'' and maintain Swiss
neutrality toward all affected countries. ''That is our
obligation.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak issued a statement in
Jerusalem expressing ''satisfaction'' that the agent would now be
allowed to return home.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are rather happy with the verdict,'' Bental's chief lawyer
Ralph Zloczower told the AP. ''We will not appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual gesture, Bental shook hands with each judge. But
the soft-spoken agent, whose testimony in Hebrew was translated
into German for the court, made no comment before leaving from a
side door.
</P>
<P>
   Although the short, stocky agent with a dark crew cut was
visible from the public gallery all week, no photographs of him
were allowed for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Mossad agents in Israel reportedly were angry that the Barak
government sent one of their own back to Switzerland for the
high-profile trial.
</P>
<P>
   Bental conceded from the beginning that each of the three
charges against him was true -- that he acted illegally for a
foreign country, conducted political espionage and repeatedly used
false foreign identity documents. He was found guilty on all three
counts.
</P>
<P>
   He and four other agents were caught in 1998 as they tried to
install equipment to eavesdrop on telephone conversations of a
Swiss-Lebanese living in a quiet suburb of the capital, Bern.
</P>
<P>
   The other agents -- two men and two women -- were released by
local police after questioning, but Bental was handed over to the
federal police because he had a diplomatic bag containing the tools
used to install the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Bental's lawyers said that the target of the wiretap,
Lebanese-born Abdallah el-Zein, was ''known to the Israeli secret
service as an adherent and member of Hezbollah.'' They had asked
that Bental be acquitted on grounds that he was trying to prevent
terrorist attacks on Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss prosecutors said there was no evidence of an immediate
threat to Israel and they demanded Bental be imprisoned for 15
months, with a reduction for the 65 days already served in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The court said the sentence would be suspended for two years --
meaning he would be sent to prison for one year if he committed an
offense in Switzerland in the next two years. It barred Bental from
setting foot on Swiss soil for five years.

<HEADLINE> Chagall Exhibit Opens in Belarus  </HEADLINE>
By MARINA BABKINA
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINSK, Belarus (AP) -- An exhibit of artist Marc Chagall's
sketches went on display Friday in Belarus, offering viewers a rare
glimpse of their native son's vast work as an artist in exile.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Belarusian landscape and provincial traditions
inspired Chagall throughout his life, none of the former Soviet
republic's museums display work by the world-renowned artist.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit in the capital Minsk, marking the 113th anniversary
of Chagall's birth Friday, is only the second time his works have
come to Belarus since he emigrated to France in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Soviet authorities frowned on Chagall for having fled the
country, but many people in Belarus now mention him as one of the
country's most illustrious natives.
</P>
<P>
   The works on display at Minsk's National Art Museum included 20
sketches for a job he took in 1964 decorating the ceiling of the
Paris Opera house and 10 lithographs with scenes from that city in
the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The pastels, gouaches and ink drawings on display through August
at the National Art Museum are being shown for their first time in
Belarus.
</P>
<P>
   Chagall's granddaughters and a great-granddaughter unveiled the
works. Exhibit organizers included the French Foreign Ministry and
the Belarusian Culture Ministry. The last time Chagall's works
showed in Belarus was in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Chagall left the Soviet Union in 1922 after briefly embracing
the Communist ideals of the Bolshevik revolution, and spent the
rest of his life in exile in Paris and then the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Scenes from his hometown of Vitebsk northeast of Minsk served as
a recurring theme in Chagall's art until his death in 1985.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose strongly Friday as investors
welcomed the latest indication that the U.S. economy is slowing
enough to forestall more interest rate hikes. The brightening mood
particularly helped banks and retailers.
</P>
<P>
   In midafternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 129.76 at 10,611.23.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 21.91 at 1,478.58, and the Nasdaq composite index
rose 71.19 to 4,031.76.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department reported Friday that total employment rose
by only 11,000 in June, the smallest increase in four years. It was
the latest sign that the economy has been cooling in response to a
series of interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve in the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been hoping that the Fed may be nearly done with
its current campaign to fight back inflationary pressures and may
be ready to leave rates alone for the next several months.
</P>
<P>
   An improving outlook for interest rates put a glow on financial
companies, which benefit from steady or declining interest rates.
Chase Manhattan rose $1.375 to $49.375, Bank One rose $1.25 to
$30.063 and BankAmerica rose $1.50 to $47.50.
</P>
<P>
   Big retailers also gained with the expectation that steadier
interest rates will fuel consumer buying. Those included Home
Depot, up $3.50 at $54.75, and Wal-Mart, up $3.625 to $60.625.
</P>
<P>
   The positive jobs report helped calm the market, which has been
jittery over the past week ahead of second-quarter earnings
announcements.
</P>
<P>
   Gainers on the stock market Friday included Texas Instruments,
up $2.938 at $70.063; and Gateway, up $5.125 at $62.875.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm bucked the upward trend, slipping $4.563 to $57.125 on
a report that Korean wireless operators would not use technology
from the telecom company. Yahoo also slipped $6.688 to $115 as a
brokerage house downgraded the stock, citing concerns about revenue
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by a 3-to-2 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 632.54 million
shares, up from Thursday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 3.99 to 527.31.

<HEADLINE> Penguins Rescued in South Africa  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- The penguins just keep coming.
</P>
<P>
   For two weeks -- ever since an oil spill off South Africa's coast
began threatening tens of thousands of African penguins -- the
largest bird-rescue operation ever undertaken has churned along.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10,000 untainted penguins have been evacuated from
their island home off Cape Town's coast, driven eight hours east
and released into the ocean for the long swim home. Authorities
hope the trip will take them at least 10 days -- long enough to
break up the spill from a tanker that sank off Cape Town on June
23.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, oil-soaked penguins have arrived by the truckload at
a warehouse-turned-bird refugee center. By Friday, more than 18,000
traumatized birds had been brought to the warehouse and 4,000 more
were being housed in other rehabilitation centers in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are expected to climb.
</P>
<P>
   ''To see the birds in this state is absolutely shocking,'' said
volunteer Craig Viljoen. ''The birds are suffering and time is
starting to take its toll on them.''
</P>
<P>
   The warehouse is abuzz with activity. Volunteers of all ages don
bright yellow oilskins and pitch in to care for the birds, which
must be watched over for up to two months until their coats have
regained the waterproofing destroyed by the oil.
</P>
<P>
   ''The response has been incredible. We've had people from all
around the world coming to help,'' said Robin Thompson, a youth
hostel owner who is recruiting backpackers to volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 blue plastic pools serve as the penguins' homes
until their release. For 14 hours a day, volunteers move from pool
to pool, coaxing small fish down the throats of the birds, which
have no scruples about biting the hand that feeds them. Other
workers thaw the several tons of fish the birds consume daily.
</P>
<P>
   An enclosure serves as a nursery for 400 fluffy chicks. Though
not tainted by the oil, they were separated from their parents and
need to be fed for about a month until they are ready to go to sea.
</P>
<P>
   A separate room houses washing stations, where volunteers scrub
wriggling penguins clean -- an exhausting process that takes up to
an hour for each bird.
</P>
<P>
   Viljoen has been constructing an artificial beach and dam
outside the warehouse where the penguins will be able to swim for
brief periods. Without their waterproof coats, they can't swim for
too long without suffering hypothermia.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we started out it was chaos, but controls have
systematically been put in place,'' Viljoen said.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 1 percent of the captured birds have died, and
veterinarians say the rehabilitated birds have a good chance of
survival.
</P>
<P>
   ''This operation is incredible. It's fantastic. We're running
smoothly,'' said Steve Sarrow, the curator of birds at Baltimore
Zoo, who was helping look after the chicks.
</P>
<P>
   The penguin centers are being run by the Southern African
National Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds. A team
of more than 40 international experts flown in by the International
Fund for Animal Welfare manages the centers.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the penguins were captured from Robben Island, home
to the world's third-largest penguin colony, which was badly hit by
the spill. The island once housed a prison that held political
prisoners, including former President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand more oil-coated penguins were hauled from their
burrows on Dassen Island, a nature reserve 40 miles northwest of
Cape Town, where an estimated 55,000 birds lived -- the world's
largest colony of African penguins.
</P>
<P>
   Treasure, the tanker that caused the spill, was carrying 1,300
tons of thick, sticky bunker oil, some of which is still trapped in
its tanks.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the South African Maritime Authority said the slick
was shrinking and dispersing naturally, although large patches of
oil were still visible in the bay. A salvage company has managed to
pump about 40 tons of oil off the wrecked ship.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the efforts, the penguins' future is less than rosy.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Williams, South Africa's top penguin expert, estimates it
will take at least five years before the population recovers,
assuming it is not struck by other major disasters.
</P>
<P>
   African penguins, which are listed as vulnerable to extinction,
are only found off the coast of southern Africa. The population is
estimated at between 150,000 and 180,000 -- 10 percent of what it
was thought to be 100 years ago, according to the World Wildlife
Fund.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Conference To Meet in Africa  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- With the AIDS pandemic
sweeping across Africa, thousands of the world's top experts on the
disease are gathering for the 13th International AIDS Conference --
the first time the meeting has been held on the continent most
ravaged by the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy percent of the 34 million people infected with the virus
that causes AIDS live in sub-Saharan Africa. Nearly all the world's
11 million AIDS orphans live here as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''The world is finally recognizing that this is where the center
of the epidemic now is,'' said Karen Bennett, spokeswoman for the
conference, which begins Sunday in Durban.
</P>
<P>
   The conference delegates ''are the guys who develop the drugs
and vaccines. I think it will be great if they can look around and
see who they are developing them for,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   They will not have far to look in Durban, the capital of
KwaZulu-Natal province, where nearly one-third of pregnant women
are HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
   That rate, though the highest in South Africa, is not
extraordinary among many African countries, where the disease has
raged out of control.
</P>
<P>
   In Botswana, nearly 36 percent of adults are infected with AIDS
or HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, according to U.N. estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Coffin sales are booming in Zimbabwe, where 25 percent of adults
are infected.
</P>
<P>
   Many countries in East Africa have double-digit adult infection
rates.
</P>
<P>
   West Africa is not yet as badly affected, but one in 20 adults
in Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation with more than 100
million people, are HIV positive. Every minute, another Nigerian
becomes infected.
</P>
<P>
   On a continent where many countries spend just $5 a year per
capita on health care, few of those infected have any chance of
getting access to the drug cocktails that have helped many of those
infected continue to live healthy, productive lives in Western
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The disease threatens to severely damage many economies on what
is already the poorest continent in the world. Medical costs and
the number of AIDS orphans are expected to explode. Life
expectancies already have plunged.
</P>
<P>
   ''All gains in development, in quality of life, in economic
growth, would at the very least cease and could be reversed,'' said
Alan Whiteside, head of the Health Economics and HIV/AIDS Research
Division at the University of Natal in Durban.
</P>
<P>
   The virus' spread is not unstoppable, however.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda, once plagued by an HIV rate of nearly 14 percent, now
presents a picture of hope for Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidance of President Yoweri Museveni, Uganda launched
an intensive public-awareness campaign in partnership with civic
and religious groups. Billboards throughout the country warn of
''Ukimwi,'' the Swahili term for AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The HIV rate has now plunged to 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''In terms of prevention, the absolutely crucial thing is to
have leadership at every level, and I mean every level, from the
president right down to the village elders and everybody in
between,'' Whiteside said. ''Uganda is a superb example of a
tremendous response at the leadership level.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia, with an estimated 3 million people infected, has begun
following Uganda's lead.
</P>
<P>
   State, party and private newspapers run daily announcements on
their front pages urging condom use, television news airs AIDS
announcements every night and state television has begun running
heart-rending public information spots showing young children
mourning their AIDS-riddled parents.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are now openly discussing how the killer disease is
transmitted and the precautions to be taken. There has been a
marked change in the perception of people, of the virus,'' said
Tesfu Mengesha, president of the Dawn of Hope Association,
established by AIDS victims to fight the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Many other countries, though, have yet to tackle AIDS so
aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   And with testing nonexistent in rural areas and the stigma
associated with the disease so intense, many prevention efforts
that do exist have fallen flat.
</P>
<P>
   Some peer educators trained to teach their neighbors about safe
sex are themselves refusing to wear condoms.
</P>
<P>
   Even businesses in urban areas, where people tend to be more
educated, are finding their workers resistant to prevention
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   One South African paint factory began an intensive AIDS
education effort for its 400 workers, with videos in indigenous
languages and small-group discussions with peer educators, said Dr.
Lorraine Becker, the factory's medical officer.
</P>
<P>
   Only four of those workers take the free condoms the company
gives out, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite all these awareness programs and all the things we
were doing, it wasn't actually touching base,'' Becker said. ''It
was like peddling a bicycle uphill without a chain on.''
</P>
<P>
   The 12,000 delegates and journalists at the AIDS conference,
which has adopted the theme ''Break the Silence,'' might help
dispel the stigma and inspire serious discussions about the disease
across the continent, said Bennett, the conference spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're hoping that this conference will actually take the
disease to the people, so that they realize it is right on their
doorstep, it is their problem too,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Accused General Will Retire  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The two-star general accused of sexually
harassing the Army's highest-ranking woman has asked to retire,
officials said Friday. The move apparently closes a case that drew
widespread attention and already cost Maj. Gen. Larry Smith an
appointment to be the Army's deputy inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was given a written reprimand for conduct unbecoming an
officer and for sexually harassing an officer. He has submitted his
request to retire Sept. 1, Army spokesman Col. Edwin Veiga said.
Officials said it was likely the request would be approved.
</P>
<P>
   The general denied any wrongdoing in a brief statement issued by
the Army on his behalf, his first public comment on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, for the good of my family and the Army, we have
elected to put it behind us and move on with our lives,'' he said,
making no explicit mention of the alleged offense nor his intention
to retire.
</P>
<P>
   His accuser, Lt. Gen. Claudia Kennedy, said: ''I am satisfied
with the Army's action in this case. As far as I am concerned, this
matter is closed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army's announcement marked the first time it publicly
acknowledged that Kennedy made an accusation and that Smith was the
accused officer. Kennedy, a three-star general, outranked Smith. In
May, officials privately acknowledged that Army inspector general
Lt. Gen. Michael Ackerman had substantiated Kennedy's allegation,
but no details were offered.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a Freedom of Information Act request, the Army
released a sanitized copy of the inspector general's report Friday.
It said it had substantiated two allegations: that Smith
''improperly displayed disrespect toward a commissioned officer ...
by holding her and kissing her against her will,'' and that he had
''improperly sexually harassed'' Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   There were no witnesses to the incident, which was said to have
occurred in Kennedy's Pentagon office in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The report said Smith and Kennedy were in ''total disagreement''
about what happened in her office that day.
</P>
<P>
   Smith told investigators he had hugged Kennedy and possibly
given her a ''cheek kiss.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He denied anything beyond that happened,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy told investigators he grabbed her, held her against her
will and kissed her.
</P>
<P>
   Smith provided 52 character witnesses in his defense, seven of
whom were interviewed by the inspector general's office. Six others
who had served with Smith also were interviewed. None said they
knew of any prior misconduct by Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general concluded Smith was a ''highly respected
officer and gentleman with an unblemished career.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it found that Kennedy's credibility was a decisive
factor. She had no motive for making a false allegation against
Smith, the report said, and the two generals were not in
competition for the same job.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who is married, began his Army career in 1966 as a second
lieutenant and served three tours of duty in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement announcing the outcome, the Army said Smith had
been given an ''administrative memorandum of reprimand'' on
Wednesday by Gen. John Keane, the vice chief of staff who reviewed
the inspector general's finding.
</P>
<P>
   The Army saw no basis for a criminal proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, the Army announced that Smith was to become deputy
inspector general, a move that spurred Kennedy two months later to
tell superiors about the alleged incident.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's job changed was suspended in November and quietly
rescinded in May. Since November, he has worked as a special
assistant to the Army Materiel Command's commanding general.
</P>
<P>
   At a retirement ceremony June 2 -- 31 years to the day after she
entered the Army -- Kennedy said the institution she grew up with
has made ''measured and steady'' progress toward fairer treatment
of female soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our Army is filled with women and men who care and who are in
a position to change and improve the conditions under which we
serve,'' Kennedy said then. ''Today, more than ever, women are a
powerful force'' in the U.S. military, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said she had more than fulfilled the aspirations she
held when she was commissioned a second lieutenant on June 2, 1969
-- at a time when women served in a separate Women's Army Corps.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've risen further than I ever dared to hope,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy had served since May 1997 as the Army's deputy chief of
staff for intelligence. With her departure, the Army has no
three-star female generals.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that since she entered the Army, thousands of
positions once held exclusively by men have been opened to women,
and she said of the Army's male-dominated culture: ''It is
responsive, it is changing, and it is highly accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The change has been measured and steady,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although she has left her Pentagon post, Kennedy's official
retirement date is Aug. 1. Her departure plans were set before her
sexual harassment case became public in March.

<HEADLINE> Iran Students Mark Dormitory Raid  </HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Students said Friday they will hand out
flowers in Tehran's streets and light candles to commemorate last
year's bloody raid on a university dormitory -- a peaceful plan
praised by a key hard-line politician.
</P>
<P>
   ''I appreciate that the student groups have decided to
commemorate the anniversary in this way, which does not create any
controversy,'' former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani said
during a Friday prayer sermon at Tehran University.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's planned vigil comes a year after one student was
killed and scores were injured in a July 9, 1999, pre-dawn raid on
a Tehran University dormitory.
</P>
<P>
   The raid by hard-line security forces and vigilantes came hours
after students rallied against the banning of a liberal newspaper.
It triggered six days of nationwide protests by tens of thousands
of students -- the worst unrest in Iran since the 1979 Islamic
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   During a subsequent trial for a police chief and 19
subordinates, students testified they were beaten until hallways
became slippery with blood. The defendants are still awaiting
verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   Two large Iranian student groups, the Office for Fostering Unity
and the Islamic Students Association, are among those leading
Saturday's memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will hand out flowers to show our hatred for violence and
to seek to promote tolerance and peaceful dialogue in our
society,'' Akbar Atri, a leader of the Office for Fostering Unity,
said Friday. Islamic Students Association members have called on
students to light candles on campuses and in dormitories to
commemorate the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Students have been at the forefront of President Mohammad
Khatami's reform movement. But government hard-liners, who control
the police, judiciary and broadcast media, believe broadening
social and political freedoms conflicts with the country's Islamic
ideals and have been trying to stem the push for reform.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three months, the conservative judiciary has closed
19 newspapers, most of them pro-reform, and has ordered the
detention of several journalists and political activists.

<HEADLINE> Lawsuits multiply over price of prison inmate calls  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN SKILES LUKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - Inmates in seven states, including New York,
are suing over the high cost of making phone calls from prison.
</P>
<P>
   They are challenging the deals under which a state or county
government gets as much as 60 cents on the dollar from a telephone
company that is given exclusive rights to handle all calls from
behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Corp. spokesman Tom Hopkins said that the highinmate rates
- in Indiana, $3.95 for the initial long-distance hookup, plus 69
cents a minute - are necessary to pay for the accompanying security
measures.
</P>
<P>
   But critics consider the leasing commissions legalized kickbacks
and point to Nebraska, where inmates' long-distance collect calls
cost just 19 cents a minute while being subject to similar security
controls.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's gouging and profiteering,'' said Stephen Seliger, a
Chicago lawyer involved in class-action lawsuits against three
states and Corrections Corp. of America, a company that runs 70
prisons nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville-based CCA declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Class-action lawsuits have been filed in Illinois, Indiana,
Ohio, New Mexico, New York, New Hampshire and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The contracts have become a significant source of revenue for
states. Indiana took in $6.3 million last year from all state pay
phones, most of them in prisons. New York made $25 million;
California $24 million; and Illinois $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   While some states, including Oregon, Florida and New York,
require that at least some of the state's profits pay for
inmate-related programs, others do not. The 53 percent cut of
revenue that Indiana gets under its contract with AT&AMP;T goes into
the state's general fund to pay for everything from renovations to
the Statehouse to Y2K computer compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska has never accepted commissions. It has a contract with
Sprint that allows for the same security measures common in other
states - including prisoner ID numbers, pre-approved call lists and
monitoring of the calls, all of which must be collect.
</P>
<P>
   ''We decided that we didn't want to make money at the expense of
the inmates,'' said Steve King, a Nebraska Corrections Department
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, 38-year-old Selena Kingsley racked up $7,000 in
phone bills during the four years her husband was imprisoned on
drug charges. She said she still owes the phone company, and the
costs ruined her financially.
</P>
<P>
   ''They espouse this theory of wanting to keep families together,
and the only way we had to keep in contact was the telephone,'' she
said. ''The phone companies have got you. They know you'll accept
the calls.''

<HEADLINE> 3 East German Leaders Cleared  </HEADLINE>
By THOMAS SCHMOLL
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Three aging men who once helped run communist East
Germany were cleared Friday of manslaughter charges in the deaths
of citizens trying to breach the Berlin Wall, a surprise verdict
that outraged former democracy activists.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they would appeal, keeping open what is likely
to be the last case against former East German leaders. It was the
first acquittal of former senior officials on trial for the
shoot-to-kill border policy, imposed to keep East Germans from
fleeing to the West during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The defense had argued for acquittal because the defendants had
broken no laws under the then-communist government.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors argued that Siegfried Lorenz, Hans-Joachim Boehme
and Herbert Haeber bore responsibility for deaths between 1984 and
1989 because they were in a position to prevent them as members of
the ruling communist Politburo.
</P>
<P>
   But presiding judge Hans Luther ruled that their positions were
not enough to convict them in the Berlin state court. ''They were
simply passive, no more and no less,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling contrasted with convictions last November in similar
cases involving Egon Krenz, the last communist East German leader
and the man in charge when the Wall opened on Nov. 9, 1989, as well
as two other former Politburo members. All three were convicted of
manslaughter for deaths at the Wall and are serving prison terms of
up to 6&AMP;frac12; years.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the court ruled that the three former leaders had
actively contributed to the deaths by drafting or endorsing
Politburo decisions on border policy.
</P>
<P>
   A group of former East German democracy activists, known as the
Citizens' Bureau, condemned Friday's verdict as ''scandalous.'' In
a statement, they said it failed to provide justice for victims of
''murderous decisions'' by the communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Modrow, East Germany's last Stalinist premier and still
active in the successor party to the former East German Communist
Party, hailed the ruling. ''It would have been the peak of
absurdity had the three been convicted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had asked the court to sentence Lorenz, 69, and
Boehme, 70, to two years and nine months in prison on three charges
of manslaughter for deaths at the Wall.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths include that of Chris Gueffroy, 20, the last person
to die trying to flee -- seven months before communist authorities
opened the Wall under pressure from the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had sought two years in jail on four manslaughter
counts for Haeber, 69, who had testified that he had proposed to
the Politburo in 1984 to open the Wall so East Germans could
travel.
</P>
<P>
   Boehme and Lorenz joined the Politburo in 1986, after most
decisions how to fortify the East German border had been made.
Haeber participated in a 1985 meeting that discussed border
security, but claims he was kicked out of the Politburo after just
14 months because he argued for opening the Wall.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton wants small business tax credit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CORNING, N.Y. (AP) - U.S. Senate candidate Hillary Rodham
Clinton said Friday that if she is elected she will press for
legislation to offer a special job-creating tax credit for small
businesses in struggling cities, including many across upstate New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ''Between 1992 and 1997 more than 170,000 people between the
ages of 20 and 29 left upstate New York,'' the first lady told more
than 200 people attending a Rotary Club-sponsored luncheon in
Corning.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm worried about jobs leaving upstate New York and want to
turn creating small business jobs into big business for upstate,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Clinton proposal, a tax credit worth up to $3,000 per
employee would be available for small businesses that locate in
communities that are losing population, have low job growth rates
and high poverty rates. Clinton said the plan would cost about $1
billion annually and would subsidize about 8,000 jobs in each
eligible community. That could support, she said, 160,000 jobs in
20 upstate New York cities.
</P>
<P>
   Upstate cities that could qualify under her plan, according to
aides, include Niagara Falls, Buffalo, North Tonawanda, Lackawanna,
Lockport, Jamestown, Rochester, Elmira, Auburn, Ithaca, Syracuse,
Rome, Utica, Binghamton, Amsterdam, Schenectady, Troy, Plattsburgh,
Kingston and Poughkeepsie.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Russian Spy Files Posted  </HEADLINE>
By NICK WADHAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- An online news tabloid has posted thousands of
pages of alleged intelligence on Russian politicians, businessmen
and ordinary people, saying it shows how widespread eavesdropping
still is in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence, gathered by government and independent
security services, also demonstrates that spying is no longer the
domain of the government alone, according to the tabloid.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's the government, there are private agencies -- it's a
large, collective work,'' said Sergei Pluzhnikov, an editor with
the Free-lance Bureau, which says it so far has published only
about a third of the intelligence it has. ''Everyone is under the
microscope, everyone can be watched now.''
</P>
<P>
   The published information includes files on about 150 people,
including tycoon Boris Berezovsky and the leader of Russia's
Orthodox Church, Patriarch Alexy II. Several bankers, actors,
businessmen and journalists -- including an American -- are also
included.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbing the list ''Russian-gate,'' the Free-lance Bureau said
the information points to the weakness of privacy protections in
Russia eight years after the demise of the Soviet Union, when the
government eavesdropped on whomever it wanted. Privacy laws are on
the books, but are poorly enforced.
</P>
<P>
   The Free-lance Bureau did not say where it got the information,
only that it was surveillance gathered by various groups and had
been for sale since about 1998. Pluzhnikov said the Free-lance
Bureau bought the files two months ago, but wouldn't say how much
they cost.
</P>
<P>
   Some texts allege shady dealings by top officials and
businessmen, but lack sourcing. For example, one file claims that
former President Boris Yeltsin's security staff was involved in
illegal gold mining and had ties to Moscow's notorious Solntsevo
criminal gang.
</P>
<P>
   Still others are downright mundane, including transcripts of
personal phone calls or background information about a subject's
family members.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the texts had been released before, and tabloid
newspapers like ''Top Secret'' -- where Pluzhnikov once worked --
frequently publish stories allegedly based on leaked intelligence
about prominent Russians.
</P>
<P>
   But the massive amount of text, much of it allegedly gathered by
companies seeking blackmail material or background about
competitors and clients, was cause for alarm, the Free-lance Bureau
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, ski-masked, gun-toting police raided the offices of
the media company Media-Most, saying they were investigating the
company on suspicion of illegal eavesdropping. Pluzhnikov said some
of the information on his Web site came from Media-Most
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   The Free-lance Bureau's decision to publish the information has
itself drawn fire, with human rights advocates and people included
in the list saying it too was breaking privacy laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fighting for people's civil rights isn't possible if you're
going to ignore their rights in the process,'' said Oleg Panfilov,
director of the Center for Journalism in Extreme Situations, a
Moscow-based rights group.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Agafonov, a reporter with the Novye Izvestia newspaper,
said the information about him, which included details about a trip
he took to Japan and his family, was correct and deeply unnerved
him.
</P>
<P>
   Agafonov said the material had little public interest and may
have been posted to intimidate him and others who might cross the
government or the small group of influential Russian businessmen
known as the oligarchs.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing journalistic about it,'' Agafonov said. ''I
don't rule out that it was published by the secret services to give
people a warning that they ought to correct their behavior.''

<HEADLINE> Pope's Prison Visit Raising Hopes  </HEADLINE>
By ALESSANDRA RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- With tensions rising in Italy's overcrowded prisons
and politicians debating what to do about it, Pope John Paul II's
planned visit to a prison in Rome is raising some prisoners'
expectations of a long-awaited amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul will celebrate Mass on Sunday inside Regina Coeli, a
prison in a 17th-century building that once housed a monastery.
Nine inmates will serve as altar boys and 14 others will make up
the choir.
</P>
<P>
   The scheduled two-hour visit is part of the pontiff's Holy Year
activities. It follows his recent call for governments worldwide to
make a ''gesture of clemency'' to inmates.
</P>
<P>
   In his June 30 message, the pope urged a ''reduction, even a
modest one, of the term of punishment'' as a ''clear sign of
sensitivity to their condition.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I ask His Holiness to let a bit of hope and faith enter
through these walls,'' said Domenico Franceschetti, a Regina Coeli
inmate, in a letter published Friday in the newspaper Il
Messaggero.
</P>
<P>
   Regina Coeli houses 900 inmates. While prison officials would
not provide any figures on capacity, they acknowledged the facility
is overcrowded, as are the rest of Italy's 217 prisons.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 54,000 people behind bars across the country --
14,000 more than the prisons were built to hold.
</P>
<P>
   Many inmates have been staging peaceful protests recently,
asking for better living conditions. Those in Regina Coeli pounded
on their cell bars last month, while in other places prisoners set
sheets on fire or went on hunger strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Italian politicians have been debating whether to grant some
sort of amnesty to ease the overcrowding, but have failed to reach
any agreement. Such measures require a two-thirds majority to pass
in parliament, making an accord between the center-left governing
bloc and the right-wing opposition necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The government did issue a decree Friday to spend $1.2 billion
to build more prisons and add personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The decree also lets authorities immediately expel illegal
immigrants who have committed crimes punishable with up to three
years in prison if the immigrants are caught in the act and judges
uphold the arrests. That measure aims to reduce the prison
population in Italy, where many prisoners are immigrants.

<HEADLINE> Crisis Over Orange Order March  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Last-minute efforts to defuse
the violent confrontation over Protestant marches in Northern
Ireland crashed into a wall of harsh words and suspicions on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Portadown leader of the Orange Order brotherhood, Harold
Gracey, insisted he would not enter negotiations at all unless his
followers first are permitted to parade Sunday through the town's
main Catholic neighborhood, Garvaghy Road.
</P>
<P>
   His blunt demand -- combined with his repeated refusals to
condemn the week's violence -- undercut a new compromise-minded plan
that had been presented hours earlier in Gracey's own name, though
written by advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Breandan MacCionnaith, the former Irish Republican Army prisoner
who since 1995 has led anti-Orange protesters on Garvaghy Road,
dismissed his opponents' initiative as ''a tired old proposal from
tired old men who can't face up to the reality of what is happening
around them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orange document, presented to a government-appointed Parades
Commission, offered the prospect of opening talks with MacCionnaith
-- something the conservative fraternal group has refused for years
to do -- if the ban on passing through Garvaghy Road is lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Though some observers saw hope in this approach, militant and
moderate Catholics alike said it was an unacceptably backward way
of resolving the problem. The Parades Commission agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem lies in the sequence they seek,'' said a two-page
response from the government-appointed commission. It reiterated
that negotiations involving Orange leaders and Garvaghy Road
residents should happen ''before and lead to a parade.''
</P>
<P>
   With no solution appearing likely, British soldiers charged with
keeping the hostile camps apart on Sunday erected extensive
barbed-wire defenses in pastures near the disputed turf.
</P>
<P>
   It gave the fields the look of a World War I battlefield -- the
very event that the Orangemen say they want to commemorate this
weekend. Thousands of Northern Irish men, Protestants and Catholics
alike, died in the Battle of the Somme in 1916, but Catholics say
the modern march is designed merely to annoy them.
</P>
<P>
   This year, police also have deployed massive Belgian water
cannons against the protesters who have massed each night near the
field barricades. The joint police-army positions appear
well-prepared to repel any Protestant attempt to outflank or break
through them.
</P>
<P>
   But elsewhere, Protestant hooligans have spent the week blocking
roads, hijacking and burning vehicles, threatening isolated
Catholic areas and pelting riot police with stones, firecrackers
and gasoline bombs.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest riot statistics Friday, police said 37 officers
and two soldiers had been wounded during the course of 145 attacks
on their forces, including a dozen gun attacks. They had no
statistics on injured civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they had seized 268 gasoline bombs and arrested 55
people.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's minister for Northern Ireland, Peter Mandelson,
defended the police efforts to contain the rioters, who were left
free to block many roads.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was right that riot police were containing the
violence, but often did not ''risk their lives unnecessarily by
rushing into a crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   But Catholics accused the predominantly Protestant police force,
which is supposed to be reformed as part of the peace accord, of
not doing enough either to arrest rioters or to keep them out of
vulnerable Catholic parts of Belfast. Forty-three houses and 27
businesses, most owned or occupied by Catholics, have been attacked
in the past week.

<HEADLINE> Peru Seeks To Stem Amazon Logging  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Reacting to what the government said was
unauthorized logging by a U.S. company, Peru's president has
deployed the military in an Amazon frontier region and declared
wide swaths of Peru's jungle protected zones.
</P>
<P>
   Peru's armed forces were dispatched this week to Inapari, near
the borders with Brazil and Bolivia, and President Alberto Fujimori
declared an ''environmental state of emergency'' on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The moves came after loggers working for a U.S. company
''irrationally and without authorization extracted mahogany valued
at between $37 million and $40 million,'' the government said in a
statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The exploitation of resources will take place under certain
conditions,'' Fujimori said. ''That is to say, in a sustainable
manner, which means that with time the resources will be renovated
and our forests will not be depleted.''
</P>
<P>
   But the president of a U.S. lumber company working in the region
said his company recently won a ruling in its favor from Peru's
Supreme Court and was about to restart production after the
government shut down the operation nine months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as I understand, everything was legal, and it went
through the court system,'' said Roy Newman, president of Newman
Lumber Company of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   He said the government wrongly accused his company of employing
local loggers who armed themselves and caused disturbances in
Inapari, a jungle village 500 miles east of the capital, Lima.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as I know, there is no civil disturbance in the area at
all,'' he said. ''We were invited in to work in the area and all
the people seemed happy with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's decree making parts of the jungle protected reserve
areas affects three Amazon regions.
</P>
<P>
   Two are located in the central jungle, covering a combined area
of 13.6 million acres. The other is a 2 million acre swath of
jungle in the far northeastern corner of the country near the
border with Colombia.

<HEADLINE> Report: Milan approved change in $215M city water contract without city, state OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - Without the knowledge of state or city
officials, Mayor Milton Milan's administration signed an agreement
with a water company, altering the largest contract in city
history, according to a published report.
</P>
<P>
   Under the original $215 million contract with Camden Water LLC
for privatization of the city's water and sewer system, Camden
would have received $20 million by the end of January 1999, when
the company took over operations. The money was to be used to
renovate the aging system and was to be repaid over 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   With the alteration, signed in December 1998 by Mayor Milan and
Preston Taylor, the city business administrator, the company was
allowed to pay once certain conditions were met, The Philadelphia
Inquirer reported in Friday's editions. Those conditions included
loans from third-party lenders. The city has not yet received the
payment.
</P>
<P>
   City Attorney John Misci said that, under the ordinance that
allowed the water contract, the administration was authorized to
make the change. The ordinance says the mayor can make
''nonmaterial'' changes to the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Misci said the alteration merely ''clarified'' the contract
language. He also said the change was needed because a lawsuit by a
group of residents could have threatened the deal. The lawsuit,
which sought to put the contract to a public vote, was dismissed
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The original contract with Camden Water LLC, a subsidiary of
Chicago-based U.S. Water, was approved by the city council in
September 1998 and by the state Financial Review Board in January
1999.
</P>
<P>
   City records show that the agreement was never sent to the city
clerk's office, where a copy of the contract is required to be
filed. State officials told the newspaper Thursday that they were
not aware of the change.
</P>
<P>
   The change was not included in a lawsuit filed by the city last
year against Camden Water LLC and U.S. Water demanding payment of
the $20 million. It was in response to the city's lawsuit that
Camden Water gave the court a copy of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   David A. Speziali, the lawyer representing Camden Water in the
lawsuit, said he did not know why the city did not include the
agreement in its lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I assumed that it was just an oversight,'' he told the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Speziali said he agreed with the city that the alteration did
not make material changes to the contract. He also said the company
and the city are still trying to work out how and when the $20
million would be paid.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Ali Sloan El, who opposed the privatization deal,
said members of Milan's administration ''need to be locked up, and
the key or the latch or the lock needs to be permanently sealed.
They deserve no sunlight,'' he told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said he did not remember signing the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't remember some of the stuff I signed last week, because
I sign so many documents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A call to Milan's office Friday was not immediately returned.

<HEADLINE> Croatian Court Acquits Five Serbs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- A court on Friday overturned war crimes
convictions against five Croation Serbs, saying no evidence at
their original trial linked them to attacks on Croatian cities in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   The five were first convicted in 1995 and that verdict was
upheld in 1999. They had received setnences ranging from eight to
15 years for the shelling of Croatia's eastern region during the
country's civil war. The men were held responsible for killing 10
people and wounding 30 others, state-run HINA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   But the verdict was annulled by the Supreme Court last year and
the case was sent back to the court in Osijek, 145 miles east of
Zagreb.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign observers, who have monitored the case since 1995, had
criticized both earlier verdicts, charging that the proceedings
might have been part of a campaign of vengeance against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the country's minority Serbs took up arms against
Croatia's secession from the former Yugoslavia. The Serbs then
seized a third of the country which Zagreb recaptured in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The five, who surrendered to Croatian authorities in 1998,
reiterated their innocence Friday and expressed regret for the
victims, state-run news agency HINA reported.
</P>
<P>
   Since a new, pro-Western government took power in January,
succeeding late President Franjo Tudjman's party, anti-Serb
sentiments have ebbed. The new government is eager to prove that
its courts are just and harbor no anti-Serb biases.

<HEADLINE> Dow Jumps 155; Nasdaq Climbs 81  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose strongly Friday as investors
welcomed the latest indication that the U.S. economy is slowing
enough to prevent more interest rate increases. The brightening
mood particularly helped banks and retailers.
</P>
<P>
   In late afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 155.21 at 10,636.68.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite
index rose 81.17 to 4,041.74 and The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 24.25 at 1,480.92.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department reported Friday that total employment rose
by only 11,000 in June, the smallest increase in four years. It was
the latest sign that the economy has been cooling in response to a
series of interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve in the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been hoping that the Fed may be nearly done with
its current campaign to fight back inflationary pressures and may
be ready to leave rates alone for the next several months.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a perception that the economy has slowed,'' Steven
Goldman, market strategist for Weeden &AMP; Co. of Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   An improving outlook for interest rates put a glow on financial
companies, which benefit from steady or declining interest rates.
Chase Manhattan rose $2.438 to $50, Bank One rose $1 to $30.125 and
BankAmerica rose $1.50 to $47.50.
</P>
<P>
   Big retailers also gained with the expectation that steadier
interest rates will fuel consumer buying. Those included Home
Depot, up $4 at $55.25, and Wal-Mart, up $4 to $61.25.
</P>
<P>
   The positive jobs report helped calm the market, which has been
jittery over the past week ahead of second-quarter earnings
announcements.
</P>
<P>
   Other big gainers on the stock market Friday included Texas
Instruments, up $2.813 at $70; and Gateway, up $5.375 at $63.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm bucked the upward trend, slipping $4.563 to $57.125 on
a report that Korean wireless operators would not use technology
from the telecom company. Yahoo also slipped $6.688 to $115 as a
brokerage house downgraded the stock, citing concerns about revenue
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by a 5-to-3 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 739.65 million
shares, down from Thursday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 4.76 to 528.08.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Granted Most U.S. Visas  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- The State Department, responding to a proposal
for a large increase in the number of U.S. immigrant visas for
Mexicans, said Friday the 75,000 granted to Mexicans in the last
fiscal year was the highest total worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was contained in a working paper obtained by the
Wall Street Journal from the campaign of President-elect Vicente
Fox, who will take office on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The document said a sharp increase in the number of U.S. visas
will be a foreign policy priority of Fox. A Fox policy adviser told
the Journal it would be good for Mexico if the U.S. permitted the
migration of 250,000 Mexicans a year.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher noted that U.S. law
bars any one country from receiving more than 7 percent of the
worldwide total of immigrant visas.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last fiscal year, the per-country limit was 27,083 visas for
one country, and Mexicans received all 27,083 visas that they were
allowed,'' Boucher said. When spouses and children were added, the
figure for Mexico on immigrant visas was 75,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any special provisions going beyond these normal rules and
calculations would require congressional action,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of illegal migrants entering the country is believed
to be about 300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said the administration agrees with Fox's statements
during the campaign that economic development in Mexico is a
long-range solution to the migration problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''We look forward to working with him on the migration issue
which is very important to both of us,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Rosie Perez refuses to visit estranged, dying mom  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Actress Rosie Perez, an outspoken AIDS activist,
has recently refused to visit her estranged mother, who is dying of
the disease, according to a report published Friday.
</P>
<P>
   However, Perez bristled at any suggestion that she had neglected
her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ''While it is accurate to say she is not the woman who raised me
and we are somewhat estranged, I have always wished for her the
best of health and continue to offer my support in that regard,''
Perez said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a strong AIDS activist, I have pleaded with my mother to
accept my assistance through whatever connections I may have within
the AIDS community; she has refused it,'' Perez said. ''I have also
offered her financial assistance, which was accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News reported that Lydia Perez has suffered from AIDS
for six years and is now near death.
</P>
<P>
   It quoted an unidentified nurse attending Lydia Perez as saying
that Rosie Perez last visited her mother on New Year's Day, when
she brought her a hamburger and fries from McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia Perez told News columnist Juan Gonzalez that her famous
daughter's last visit before that was ''a couple of years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Please tell her I'm dying and I just want to see her one more
time,'' the mother told Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, the star of movies including ''Do the Right Thing'' and
''White Men Can't Jump,'' has been active in the fight against
AIDS, raising money for AIDS research and counseling young people
to guard against HIV infection.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Johnson, associate executive director of the AIDS-service
group Gay Men's Health Crisis, released a statement saying that the
organization ''can confirm that Rosie Perez was personally involved
in seeking direct services for her mother at GMHC. It was our
understanding at the time that her mother declined to use our
services for personal reasons. Referrals to other agencies were
provided.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News story notes that Rosie Perez was one of 10
children born to Lydia Perez and that she spent several years in
group foster homes because her mother, who suffered from mental
illness, could not handle raising them.

<HEADLINE> Farms Crisis Deepens in Zimbabwe  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Illegal occupiers on white-owned farms
have stepped up threats and demands for owners to leave their homes
and properties, a farmers' organization said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling party militants said they were immediately taking over
land and homesteads in many areas, according to the Commercial
Farmers Union, which said farmers are near the breaking point after
five months of violent land occupations.
</P>
<P>
   The union advised farmers not to vacate their properties and
''not to back down to illegal demands'' despite only minimal
intervention from police, said Jerry Grant, its deputy director.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you get out of your house, you have lost it,'' Grant said,
acknowledging that the union's strategy could be dangerous. ''What
do you say when a widow tells you later it's your fault for giving
that advice?''
</P>
<P>
   The union cited various examples of the new threats.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, according to the union, a war veteran leader
demanded that a white farmer north of Harare pay rent to squatters
on the property. About 30 of that leader's violent followers warned
another farmer to move off his land. A third farmer was told by
ruling party militants that they will take over his building for a
pig and poultry project.
</P>
<P>
   Near Kwekwe, southwest of Harare, militants threatened Thursday
to evict a farm owner forcibly unless he reported to a nearby
office manned by veterans to sign over his land, the union
reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are getting more militant. Clearly, a directive has come
from the top. It is breaking out all over the country and it is not
spontaneous,'' Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   Militants of the National Liberation War Veterans Association
who have led the illegal occupations of more than 1,700 white-owned
farms have admitted receiving money and transport from President
Robert Mugabe's ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   The occupations began after Mugabe lost a constitutional
referendum in February that would have empowered him to seize
white-owned farms for the resettlement of landless blacks without
paying compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Militant supporters in the countryside, many of whom fought
under Mugabe's command in Zimbabwe's war of independence in 1980,
then took matters into their own hands, seizing land they say was
unlawfully taken by white settlers from its original black
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe has described the wave of seizures ''a minor trespass''
protesting unfair ownership of land by whites and ordered police
not to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Since the occupations began, political violence has claimed the
lives of 31 people, including five white farmers.

<HEADLINE> Blair's Teen-age Son Reprimanded  </HEADLINE>
By SUE LEEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife took their
son Euan to a London police station Friday, where the 16-year-old
received an official reprimand for a bout of public drunkenness.
</P>
<P>
   The reprimand was the least of three possible punishments for
Euan, who was arrested late Wednesday, drunk and vomiting in
Leicester Square after celebrating the end of his school exams.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager went with his parents to Kennington police station
in south London to learn his punishment -- avoiding the large media
crowd gathered at the central London station where he had been
expected to appear.
</P>
<P>
   A police reprimand can only be given to juveniles with no
previous convictions. If another offense follows a reprimand, the
juvenile receives a warning. If further offenses are committed,
prosecution usually will follow.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's 10 Downing St. office said that change of location for
the appearance was made for reasons of privacy and emphasized it
did not constitute special treatment for the prime minister, but a
choice available to others.
</P>
<P>
   The Blairs ''don't wish to turn this into a public event. There
is a legitimate line to be drawn in being candid and open in the
way we were yesterday ... and the legitimate desire for privacy for
the children,'' Blair's spokesman, Alastair Campbell, said earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't prevent newspapers from adding to Euan's
headache.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't know about you, Euan, but I could use a drink,'' joked
the caption beneath a file picture of father and son plastered
across the front page of the Sun tabloid Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Other tabloids, too, devoted Page 1 and ensuing chunks of space
to the news. Serious papers and TV stations also ran the story
prominently.
</P>
<P>
   But there was some sympathy for the Blairs' eldest child, who
had misjudged his capacity for alcohol -- and who already had
apologized via his father's office for causing offense.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cheer up Euan, we've all been there,'' counseled The Mirror's
headline, although it continued, mischievously, ''now get to the
cashpoint (cash machine) and pay your 100 pounds, there's a good
lad,'' a reference to Blair's unpopular proposal last week to issue
on-the-spot fines to violent drunks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Remember Euan, this is politics, and your dad won't be there
forever,'' added Carol Thatcher comfortingly a few pages on. And
she should know: She was 20 years old when her mother Margaret
became prime minister in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The incident came at a difficult time for Blair, with his
government facing opposition grousing over failing to deal with
football hooligans and internal divisions over whether Britain
should join the single European currency.
</P>
<P>
   Blair was visibly upset when he took part in a
question-and-answer session Thursday evening on the British
Broadcasting Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think if anyone breaks the law, they should suffer the
penalty of the law, whether they are my son or anyone else's son,''
he told questioners from the studio audience.
</P>
<P>
   To warm applause, the prime minister conceded, ''It's not been
the greatest day, let's put it like that, but my son is basically a
good kid and we will get through this.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair said he believed his son originally gave police a false
name and provided an old address and a false birthdate to indicate
he was of the legal drinking age because he wanted to spare his
parents embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   The Blairs have gone to great lengths to protect the privacy of
Euan, Nicky, 14, Kathryn, 12, and baby Leo, born May 20, all of
whom are shielded under Press Complaints Commission guidelines
governing minors.

<HEADLINE> Canada Conservatives Seek Leader  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- For the second time in two weeks, members of a
new conservative party vote Saturday for a leader in their effort
to unify Canada's political right and take on the governing Liberal
Party.
</P>
<P>
   The contest between former Alberta Treasurer Stockwell Day and
opposition leader Preston Manning will determine who becomes the
main challenger for the prime minister's office occupied since 1993
by Liberal leader Jean Chretien.
</P>
<P>
   Day won 44 percent in the first round of voting June 24 and
Manning got 36 percent. More than 200,000 members of the Canadian
Alliance are eligible to vote in Saturday's runoff.
</P>
<P>
   The party formed in March out of Manning's old Reform Party,
which had a base of support confined to Canada's western provinces.
Now the Alliance is the nation's largest party, based on
membership, but whether that growth can translate into nationwide
support in a federal election remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Chretien, who must call an election by the end of 2001, has
dismissed the Alliance as little more than a repackaged version of
the Reform Party, which failed to win a single seat in Parliament
east of Manitoba in the 1997 election.
</P>
<P>
   Manning, 58, who led the Reform Party's rise from a western
protest movement in 1987 into the official Parliament opposition,
engineered the creation of the Canadian Alliance to stop
vote-splitting on the right by attracting traditional supporters of
the Conservative Party.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between Manning and Day, 49, are more style than
substance. Both come from Alberta, both have been preachers, and
both espouse strongly conservative economic principles. In
addition, both men are considered social conservatives who oppose
abortion, want tougher penalties for criminals and more controls on
immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Day, however, has a reputation for bluntness on social issues
that Manning warns will harm the Alliance's chances of forming a
nationwide conservative movement in the same way divisions over
issues such as abortion have divided U.S. conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Party acknowledges the outcome of Saturday's vote
will affect its strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've become comfortable with Preston Manning, we know Preston
Manning and we know how to deal with Preston Manning,'' Liberal
Party president Stephen LeDrew said. ''Stockwell Day, there's no
question, is a new person. We're going to have to reassess his
program, his campaign and we're going to have to adjust.''

<HEADLINE> Accused Army Gen. Asks To Retire  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The two-star general accused of sexually
harassing the Army's highest-ranking woman has asked to retire,
officials said Friday. The move apparently closes a case that drew
widespread attention and already cost Maj. Gen. Larry Smith an
appointment to be the Army's deputy inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was given a written reprimand for conduct unbecoming an
officer and for sexually harassing an officer. He has submitted his
request to retire Sept. 1, Army spokesman Col. Edwin Veiga said.
Officials said it was likely the request would be approved.
</P>
<P>
   The general denied any wrongdoing in a brief statement issued by
the Army on his behalf, his first public comment on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, for the good of my family and the Army, we have
elected to put it behind us and move on with our lives,'' he said,
making no explicit mention of the alleged offense nor his intention
to retire.
</P>
<P>
   His accuser, Lt. Gen. Claudia Kennedy, said: ''I am satisfied
with the Army's action in this case. As far as I am concerned, this
matter is closed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army's announcement marked the first time it publicly
acknowledged that Kennedy made an accusation and that Smith was the
accused officer. Kennedy, a three-star general, outranked Smith. In
May, officials privately acknowledged that Army inspector general
Lt. Gen. Michael Ackerman had substantiated Kennedy's allegation,
but no details were offered.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a Freedom of Information Act request, the Army
released a sanitized copy of the inspector general's report Friday.
It said it had substantiated two allegations: that Smith
''improperly displayed disrespect toward a commissioned officer ...
by holding her and kissing her against her will,'' and that he had
''improperly sexually harassed'' Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   There were no witnesses to the incident, which was said to have
occurred in Kennedy's Pentagon office in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The report said Smith and Kennedy were in ''total disagreement''
about what happened in her office that day.
</P>
<P>
   Smith told investigators he had hugged Kennedy and possibly
given her a ''cheek kiss.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He denied anything beyond that happened,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy told investigators he grabbed her, held her against her
will and kissed her.
</P>
<P>
   Smith provided 52 character witnesses in his defense, seven of
whom were interviewed by the inspector general's office. Six others
who had served with Smith also were interviewed. None said they
knew of any prior misconduct by Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general concluded Smith was a ''highly respected
officer and gentleman with an unblemished career.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it found that Kennedy's credibility was a decisive
factor. She had no motive for making a false allegation against
Smith, the report said, and the two generals were not in
competition for the same job.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., applauded the Army for its
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope her example will empower and encourage more women to be
brave enough to come forward if they have been sexually harassed or
assaulted,'' Maloney said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who is married, began his Army career in 1966 as a second
lieutenant and served three tours of duty in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement announcing the outcome, the Army said Smith had
been given an ''administrative memorandum of reprimand'' on
Wednesday by Gen. John Keane, the vice chief of staff who reviewed
the inspector general's finding.
</P>
<P>
   The Army saw no basis for a criminal proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, the Army announced that Smith was to become deputy
inspector general, a move that spurred Kennedy two months later to
tell superiors about the alleged incident.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's job changed was suspended in November and quietly
rescinded in May. Since November, he has worked as a special
assistant to the Army Materiel Command's commanding general.
</P>
<P>
   At a retirement ceremony June 2 -- 31 years to the day after she
entered the Army -- Kennedy said the institution she grew up with
has made ''measured and steady'' progress toward fairer treatment
of female soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our Army is filled with women and men who care and who are in
a position to change and improve the conditions under which we
serve,'' Kennedy said then. ''Today, more than ever, women are a
powerful force'' in the U.S. military, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said she had more than fulfilled the aspirations she
held when she was commissioned a second lieutenant on June 2, 1969
-- at a time when women served in a separate Women's Army Corps.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've risen further than I ever dared to hope,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy had served since May 1997 as the Army's deputy chief of
staff for intelligence. With her departure, the Army has no
three-star female generals.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that since she entered the Army, thousands of
positions once held exclusively by men have been opened to women,
and she said of the Army's male-dominated culture: ''It is
responsive, it is changing, and it is highly accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The change has been measured and steady,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although she has left her Pentagon post, Kennedy's official
retirement date is Aug. 1. Her departure plans were set before her
sexual harassment case became public in March.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Missile Defense Test Ready  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon's rocket scientists stood ready
Friday to light the fuse on a $100 million missile defense test
which, if successful, could move the United States a step closer to
building a nationwide antimissile shield. Congress says it is
urgently needed; critics decry it as unworkable.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is the future of a multibillion dollar project that has
upset Russia and China and caused many of America's closest
European allies to wince at the prospect of a U.S.-only defense
against missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   Although President Clinton says he will decide soon whether to
keep the project moving toward an anticipated deployment in 2005,
it will be up to his successor to make the final steps to build and
deploy it. It is the fast-approaching decision deadline for Clinton
that gave Friday's test extra public attention.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was for an interceptor rocket to launch from an Army
missile range on Kwajalein Atoll in the central Pacific 20 minutes
after a target missile flies aloft from Vandenberg Air Force Base,
Calif. The intent was for a small, maneuverable ''kill vehicle''
carried into space by the Kwajalein rocket to guide itself into the
path of the target missile, pulverizing both in a collision at
16,000 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   If it works, Defense Secretary William Cohen is likely to
recommend to Clinton that he take the first steps in a phased
building plan that would have the missile defense system ready to
use by December 2005.
</P>
<P>
   If it fails, Cohen could still recommend going ahead, but it
would appear more likely that he would favor another option such as
stretching out the timetable to allow for more flight tests. The
Pentagon's independent advisers have said the 2005 timetable may be
overly ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bacon, Cohen's spokesman, said Friday before the test
that Cohen did not expect to make his recommendation for another
three or four weeks and he could not predict what it would be.
</P>
<P>
   This was the third in a series of missile intercept tests. The
first, last October, succeeded. The second, in January, failed.
Friday's test was delayed more than two months to fix the problem
that plagued January's test.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-nuclear activist group Greenpeace hoped to halt
Friday's test by placing a ship in the Pacific where a rocket stage
is expected to splash down about 110 miles offshore from
Vandenberg, said Steve Shallhorn, the group's campaign director.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has asked pilots and sailors to avoid the area
during the test or risk damage or injury but said the test could
continue even with a ship in the zone.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace also set up camp outside Vandenberg's main gate, and
a group of protesters not affiliated with Greenpeace threatened to
delay the launch by breaking into the base. Pentagon officials said
launch preparations were proceeding on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House before Friday's test, spokesman P.J. Crowley
said that even if the missile hit its target there would be weeks
of detailed analysis before the Pentagon could verify that
everything worked properly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would say a hit doesn't automatically suggest success, nor
does a failure automatically come with a miss tonight,'' Crowley
said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest backers of missile defense in Congress, Sen.
Thad Cochran, R-Miss., said in an interview Friday that he believes
America can afford a missile defense even though defense dollars
are tight.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without a doubt, Congress will approve the funding for a
missile defense system'' so long as U.S. military leaders feel
confident it is technologically ready for deployment, Cochran said.
Cost estimates range from the Pentagon's $36 billion to the General
Accounting Office's $60 billion.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the Pentagon must deploy a national missile defense as
soon as it is technologically feasible.
</P>
<P>
   Feasibility and cost are two of four factors Clinton has said he
will take into account in deciding whether to give the Pentagon the
go-ahead to begin preparing a construction site on Shemya Island in
the Aleutians. A high-powered ''X-band'' radar would be built there
to track a missile in flight toward the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The other two factors Clinton will consider are the urgency of
the missile threat against the United States and the implications
of building a missile defense for U.S. foreign relations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton needs to decide soon because construction on Shemya
cannot begin before next spring, leaving barely enough time to
complete the radar and get the rest of the project done by the 2005
target date.
</P>
<P>
   The 2005 date is significant because intelligence officials
believe North Korea will have the capability by then of fielding a
long-range missile that could reach U.S. territory. Recently,
however, North Korea has reaffirmed a pledge not to test any
longer-range ballistic missiles so long as it is engaged in
discussions with the United States about improving diplomatic
relations and reducing the risk of war on the Korean peninsula.

<HEADLINE> Brazilians Demand End to Violence  </HEADLINE>
By PETER MUELLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The faces of the dead stare out
from the Mural of Pain, stretching 500 feet in downtown Rio -- the
centerpiece of a nationwide protest against violence Friday that
brought thousands of demonstrators into the streets of cities
across Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Led by human rights groups, the protest called ''Basta! Eu Quero
Paz'' -- or ''Enough! I Want Peace'' in Portuguese -- featured a day
of marches, rallies and services. Organizers asked Brazilians to
wear white and to light a candle in a window at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Violence is nothing new in Brazil, but there is a sense that it
is getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   The murder rate in Sao Paulo, Brazil's biggest city, jumped 9
percent last year to a record 5,705 homicides, according to
government figures. Murder is now the No. 3 cause of death in Sao
Paulo, after heart attack and stroke.
</P>
<P>
   In Rio de Janeiro, there are 69 murders for every 100,000
residents, according to official figures -- an annual rate that is
among the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   On the mural in Rio's downtown Carioca Square, the victims of
violence smile from baby pictures and holiday snapshots, in
swimsuits and graduation gowns. Police officers killed on duty are
lined up, row after row. People paused Friday to examine the faces,
put up new ones or just quietly cry.
</P>
<P>
   ''This does not resolve the problem, of course,'' said Edilson
Matos, a designer of the mural. ''But if people are touched, it
could alleviate it just a little.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sao Paulo, grade school children painted panels and banners
with peace messages that were draped around downtown Se Plaza. A
multi-religious service was scheduled during the evening, and
organizers planned to distribute 10,000 candles and release
thousands of white balloons.
</P>
<P>
   Similar marches and demonstrations were held in a dozen other
state capitals.
</P>
<P>
   ''The response has been tremendous. We've already run out of
space on the mural,'' said Rubem Cesar Fernandes, head of the
rights group Viva Rio.
</P>
<P>
   A series of recent high-profile crimes shocked the country into
a consensus that something must be done.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Brazilians watched in horror as a live TV broadcast
showed a kidnapper seizing a Rio city bus and threatening to kill
passengers. When police botched a rescue attempt, the kidnapper
killed a young woman hostage, then was smothered to death in the
police paddy wagon after he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, the government proposed a $1.7 billion anti-crime
package that would sharply limit gun sales, hire 2,000 new federal
agents, better train and equip police and improve lighting in
neighborhoods across the country. While most measures must be
approved by Congress, gun sales were immediately suspended for six
months.
</P>
<P>
   ''Society is demanding from all of us a quicker response,''
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said in announcing the
measures. ''We could ask, who among us has not suffered because of
violence?''
</P>
<P>
   Isabel Cristina Carneiro still suffers from the loss of her
niece Soraya, stabbed to death by her husband in front of their
three children. Wearing a T-shirt stamped with Soraya's smiling
face, she looked at the mural Friday and talked about peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''I used to feel such anger, but I know I cannot raise her
children in an atmosphere of anger and hate,'' Carneiro said.
</P>
<P>
   She gestured at the panel of faces, noting they were only a
small percentage of the city's victims of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are not even 10 percent, but this helps us to spread the
word,'' she says. ''Peace is not for now, but for the future. We
are working for our children, maybe our grandchildren.''

<HEADLINE> Farm workers appear in court for co-worker's slaying  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAYS LANDING, N.J. (AP) - A migrant farm worker charged in the
slaying of a co-worker called the accusations ''lies'' Friday when
he went before a judge.
</P>
<P>
   ''What has been said, it's all lies,'' Ruperto Hernandez, 35,
told Superior Court Judge Manuel Greenberg. ''There's some mistake
about what the police are saying,'' he said, through interpreter
Carmen Sacco.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, 23-year-old Javier S. Vasquez and Martin A. Madera,
27, who live at Buena Vista Farms in Vineland, are each charged
with murder and conspiracy to commit murder.
</P>
<P>
   Vasquez also is charged with aggravated assault.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say Vasquez got into a fight with Gaspar Leon, 34,
in a bunkhouse at the farm and hit him over the head with a bottle.
The three then took Leon to a rural roadside, where Hernandez and
Madera held Leon down as Vasquez slit his throat, according to
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez allegedly held Leon's head up so Vasquez could slash
his throat; Madera used his foot to held Leon down, according to a
criminal complaint read in court Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The three, who are Mexican nationals, were being held on
$250,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic County Prosecutor Jeffrey Blitz said Vasquez slashed
Leon's throat with a parsley knife before abandoning the body in
woods off Jackson Road in Buena Vista Township, where a passing
motorist found it Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   No motive has been given for the killing. Assistant Atlantic
County Prosecutor Murray Talasnik would not comment on it Friday,
nor would he say what evidence led police to the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   No decision has been made about whether to seek the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   None of the suspects were represented by lawyers at their
appearances before Greenberg. Each asked for court-appointed
lawyers.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Appear Before Okinawans  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Japanese anger over criminal and unruly
behavior by U.S. soldiers could overshadow global economic issues
when President Clinton joins a summit of world leaders on Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   A Marine corporal stands accused of fondling a junior high
schoolgirl in the latest incident in years of trouble between local
residents and U.S. troops based in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said Friday that Clinton plans a speech to
residents at Okinawa's Peace Park upon his arrival for the July
20-23 summit as well as meetings with community leaders. It will be
the first visit of a U.S. President to the island where 26,000 U.S.
troops are stationed. In all, Japan hosts 47,000 U.S. military
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman P. J. Crowley said Clinton would be prepared to deal
with the issue of complaints against U.S. troops when he attends
the July 21-23 Group of Eight summit on Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something we view very seriously, and the military
command is working closely with local leaders'' on the
investigation of U.S. soldiers' conduct, Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps on Friday imposed a strict curfew and added a
ban on liquor and civilian dress for corps members. A broader U.S.
military curfew in effect since 1995 when three servicemen were
convicted of raping a 12-year-old Okinawa girl had been lifted only
last October.
</P>
<P>
   The new midnight-7:30 a.m. curfew, applying only to Marines,
followed arrest of a 19-year-old Marine lance corporal who was
charged by local police with ''indecency and unlawful entry.'' The
mother of a junior high school student told police she found the
soldier drunk and half-naked, on top of the girl, kissing and
fondling her as she screamed.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's ambassador to Washington, Shunji Yanai, said the
Japanese government is concerned over the incident and supports the
idea of Clinton having ''contact with the local people'' during the
July 21-23 G-8 summit with leaders of Japan, the United States,
Canada, Britain, Germany, Japan, Italy and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is really an unfortunate incident. And I hope that it will
not affect the environment of the G-8 summit,'' the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   He said the summit is intended to focus on greater global
prosperity, including the spread of information technology, social
development and debt relief for developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the concerns of local residents over the U.S. military
presence and a continuation of recent demonstrations that could
detract from the summit theme, Yanai said Clinton is expected to
get a good reception on Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be a wonderful occasion for the U.S. president to
address the local people, who host many U.S. military bases,''
Yanai said.
</P>
<P>
   Another U.S. action that has added to tension between Americans
and Okinawans before the summit is cancellation of plans for
Secretary of State Madeleine Alright to attend a July 12-13 foreign
ministers meeting ahead of the G-8 sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Miyazaki City, where she was to dedicate a 500-seat school
auditorium, reacted by reversing a decision to name the auditorium
for Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Yanai said, however, that Japanese leaders understand her need
to handle the Mideast peace summit beginning at Camp David, Md.,
next week.
</P>
<P>
   The White House stressed that Clinton, who is also participating
in the Mideast talks, would attend the Okinawa summit.

	   JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) - Authorities in Hudson County were
searching for three suspects Friday, one of whom fired shots at a
county sheriff's officer.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Bruce Miller, returned fire at the suspects, but no
one was struck. Miller suffered an ankle injury during a foot chase
after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson County Sheriff Joseph Cassidy said Miller was on patrol
in Lincoln Park when he saw three men acting suspiciously and went
to investigate. As the officer approached, one of the men pulled
out a handgun and fired at him.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects escaped on foot, prompting a prolonged search of
the area by sheriff's officers, Jersey City police using canine
units, and state police using a helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   No arrests had been made as of Friday evening.

   ROYAL OAK, Mich. (AP) -- Even when trading in the concert stage
for a courtroom, rap star Eminem showed Friday that he knows how to
command the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan native showed up at the 44th District Court to
waive a preliminary hearing on charges that he illegally possessed

   Eminem, whose real name is Marshall Bruce Mathers III, is
accused of displaying a semiautomatic pistol June 3 during an
argument with a fellow rapper. Hours later, Macomb County
prosecutors say, he allegedly assaulted a man in a nightclub lot
after seeing the man kiss his wife, Kimberly.

<HEADLINE> 'Jaws' Author Seeks To Help Sharks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- ''Jaws'' author Peter Benchley joined a
conservation group in calling for an end to industrial practices
that kill more than 100 million sharks and shark-like fish annually
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that we have the right to extinguish any
species,'' said Benchley, whose best-selling 1974 book was about a
man-eating shark.
</P>
<P>
   According to the San Francisco-based organization WildAid, 90
percent of some species have been killed by crews seeking only fins
and fishing techniques in which sharks are caught on multiple hooks
dangling from 50-mile lines.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, the group said an average of 12 people are killed
by sharks annually.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sharks are more often the victims than the villains,'' WildAid
director Peter Knights said.
</P>
<P>
   Benchley and Knights will take their campaign to Asia, where
there is demand for shark fin soup, considered a delicacy. The tour
coincides with the 25th anniversary of the Steven Spielberg film
based on Benchley's book.

property auction when to the surprise of organizers, they found the
owner.
</P>
<P>
   After trying to track down the owner for close to a year, Deputy
State Treasurer Charles Heatherly said Friday he located her.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Ann Prall of Charlotte also learned she now is the proud
owner of a baseball autographed by Hank Aaron, savings bonds and
some coins.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a happy ending to this story,'' Heatherly said.
</P>
<P>
   Prall did not return a call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Heatherly said the baseball and other items were in a safe
deposit box with an unpaid balance of $270. The bank sent it to the
state for its annual unclaimed property auction, scheduled July 15.
</P>
<P>
   The state sent the baseball to an expert, who verified it was
the real thing, Heatherly said. The baseball was estimated to be
worth between $3,200 to $7,500, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the state didn't receive bids near $7,500, it was going to
try auctioning it on eBay or sending it to Christie's or Sotheby's
in New York, Heatherly said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But, this is the whole purpose of the program, to find the
owners of unclaimed property,'' Heatherly said.
</P>
<P>
   Every year the state treasury department gets unclaimed property
in a myriad of forms, including savings accounts, stocks, safe
deposit box contents, jewelry and electronics. The goods are
collected from banks, hospitals and occasionally public places such
as malls and airports.
</P>
<P>
   The state tries to find the property's owners by publishing
advertisements in newspapers, making radio broadcasts and sending
lists to clerks of court statewide, said Regina Morgan, operations
manager for the state treasury department.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll have a booth set up so people at the auction can check
to see if they have any unclaimed property,'' Morgan said. If all
attempts fail at locating property owners, the items are put up for
auction.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the state collected $32.6 million worth of unclaimed
property, most in the form of savings accounts, stocks and bonds.
Only tangible property - items such as the baseballs - is
auctioned.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds from the auction, estimated at $30,000 for this year,
go to the North Carolina State Education Assistance Authority for
student loans to the state's public universities. Last year, 5,316
loans were made to students.
</P>
<P>
   The 263 items at this year's auction also include a signed
baseball from Jim ''Catfish'' Hunter, gold coins, U.S. and foreign
currency, jewelry and electronics. The auction at the State
Fairgrounds is expected to draw 500 people.

<HEADLINE> White House Mulls New EPA Guidelines  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite a congressional demand to delay
action, the Clinton administration is considering imposing new
pollution controls to clean up thousands of lakes and streams --
worrying Democrats about the potential political fallout.
</P>
<P>
   The regulation, close to being issued by the Environmental
Protection Agency would create new requirements for farmers,
businesses, industrial plants and utilities in areas where water
quality does not meet federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   As much as 20,000 impaired lakes and streams -- 40 percent of the
nation's waterways -- would be affected. Critics call it an
unprecedented and costly move by the federal government to deal
with farm and industrial runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Critics such as farm groups, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and
many governors have focused intense lobbying against the proposal.
They want the administration to abandon the idea, or at least
postpone it until its cost can be more closely examined. They say
the cost could go as high as $2 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   EPA Administrator Carol Browner has argued that the new rule
will cost less than $100 million annually. She said the regulation
is necessary to address some of the country's worst water pollution
problems, which have left many lakes and streams unsuitable for
fishing or swimming.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, opponents attached to a high-priority spending bill
a rider directing the EPA to delay a decision for a year. The bill
has not been signed by President Clinton and the administration has
not ruled out issuing the new regulation before the bill becomes
law.
</P>
<P>
   Recent days have seen intense discussions at the White House
about the issue, with Browner arguing for going ahead with the
rule, said one administration source, who spoke on condition of not
being identified.
</P>
<P>
   Another administration source said the possibility remains that
Clinton would push out the new rule before signing the spending
bill, despite the possibility of a political backlash on both
Capitol Hill and the presidential campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a stick in the eye to Congress,'' says Bill Kovacs,
director of environmental affairs at the Chamber of Commerce, which
lobbied aggressively against the EPA rule.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., accused the White House of
circumventing Congress, which he said made clear it doesn't want
the new regulation imposed this year. Farm-state Democrats joined
Republicans in denouncing the new rules at a hearing last month.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, some in administration officials are concerned the
rules' passing could cause fallout in key Midwest states for Vice
President Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee,
who also supports the regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Among those complaining to Clinton about the regulation's
''major financial burden'' was Iowa Gov. Thomas Vilsack, who has
been mentioned as a possible Gore running mate.
</P>
<P>
   The regulation, formally known as the Total Maximum Daily Load
(TMDL) program, would give states 15 years to develop plans to
clean up waterways that do not meet federal water quality
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Landowners involved in agriculture for the first time would have
to comply with pollution discharge permits if they contribute to
nearby water quality problems. Industrial plants, utilities and
factories, which already must comply with pollution permits, fear
they will be subject to even tighter discharge requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rules are going to force the states to set limits that are
not well thought out,'' said Paul Bailey, an official of the Edison
Electric Institute.
</P>
<P>
   But Ed Hopkins of the Sierra Club said new efforts to address
pollution into waterways is long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we're to continue to make progress we're going to have to
address runoff from agriculture and forests and construction sites
and those other sources of pollution,'' Hopkins said.

<HEADLINE> Cost of Missile Defense Debated  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Like nearly every other aspect of the proposed
national missile
defense, its cost is hotly debated.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Pentagon is still working on an estimate, but its most
recent estimate last spring put the tally at $36 billion for a
system with 100 missile interceptors at a single site, in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The figure covers the building and operating of the system for
its expected life of 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress,
estimates it will cost $60 billion if -- as many missile defense
proponents urge -- the system is expanded to two interceptor sites,
each with 100 interceptors.

<HEADLINE> Safe Haven bill signed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Mothers who otherwise might endanger or
kill their newborns now have a humane alternative: dropping them
off at a ''safe haven,'' no questions asked.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, acting as governor, signed the
bill into law Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the measure, it's unlikely that parents who safely deliver
an unwanted child to a hospital or police station would be
prosecuted. Instead, they could simply leave an infant younger than
30 days old and walk away.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, a parent could be charged with endangering the
welfare of a child, a second-degree offense that carries a penalty
of up to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The bill does not offer blanket immunity from prosecution,
however. Parents who harm a child could still be charged
criminally.
</P>
<P>
   The measure earmarks $500,000 for a 24-hour hot line where
callers could get information about the Safe Haven law and
adoption. It also calls for a public education campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, who signed the bill at St. Joseph's Hospital and
Medical Center in Paterson, said it is designed to save lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want individuals, who for whatever reasons feel they cannot
care for their newborn infants, to leave the babies at a safe haven
such as a hospital or police station where the children can receive
the medical attention and care they need to survive,'' he said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Collins served as acting governor because Gov. Christie Whitman
and Senate President Donald DiFrancesco, who is next in the line of
succession, were both out of state Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law, people dropping off infants can remain
anonymous and do not have to provide any background or medical
information about themselves or the child.
</P>
<P>
   The state, after ensuring the child does not require medical
care, will place the infant in foster care while officials
terminate parental rights.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, five babies have been abandoned in New Jersey.
One of them, a newborn boy found lying amid litter near Paterson
railroad tracks, later died.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best-known case of fatal child abandonment was the
infant who died in 1996 after North Jersey teen couple Amy
Grossberg and Brian Peterson threw him into a trash bin outside a
Delaware motel.

<HEADLINE> Report: Most US Kids Work by Age 15  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- At age 12, half of American kids hold informal
jobs like baby-sitting or yard work, and by age 15, nearly
two-thirds are employed, according to a new Labor Department
report.
</P>
<P>
   ''The American work ethic starts at an early age,'' said Labor
Secretary Alexis Herman of the findings about young Americans'
working habits, released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that a smaller percentage of the teen-age
population held jobs in the late 1990s than two decades earlier, in
the late 1970s, however.
</P>
<P>
   During the period from 1977 to 1979, an average 30 percent of
15- to 17-year-olds held jobs during the school year and 43 percent
did in the summer. By Comparison, from 1996 to 1998, an average of
25 percent in the same age group held jobs during the school year
and 34 percent in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The BLS study combined findings from annual government surveys
of American households with in depth interviews conducted in 1997
with 9,022 young men and women who were between the ages of 12 and
16 on Dec. 31, 1996. Findings were focused on kids 15 and younger.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 interviews revealed that about 50 percent of kids had
worked in informal jobs at age 12. By age 14, the share of kids
working rose to 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
   About 43 percent of 14-year-olds were still doing only odd jobs
like neighbors' yardwork or baby-sitting, while 24 percent had
formal, ongoing employment and some did both kinds of work.
</P>
<P>
   By age 15, 64 percent of teen-agers were working -- 38 percent in
formal, ongoing employment arrangements, and 31 percent in formal
jobs that included hours worked during the school year -- not just
summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
   The average weekly hours worked by employed 15- to 17-year olds
were 23 in the summer and 17 during the school year.
</P>
<P>
   White teen-agers are more likely than minorities to work, the
study also found.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two-thirds -- 64 percent -- of white teen-agers did some
type of formal or informal work by age 14, compared with 43 and 41
percent of black and Hispanic teen-agers respectively. Similar
disparities persisted among 15-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Girls were just as likely to be working by age 15 as boys, but
were apt to be doing different types of jobs. Girls were more
likely to hold informal jobs, like baby-sitting, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Among 15-year-old boys, about 42 percent were formally employed
while only 34 percent of girls were.
</P>
<P>
   For 15-year-old boys, the top three formal jobs were cook,
janitor or cleaner, and miscellaneous food preparation. Girls of
the same age were most likely to be cashiers, waitresses or general
office clerks.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. child labor laws allow 14 and 15 year olds to do some types
of work -- such as agricultural, retail and food service jobs -- but
limit the hours they can work. Children under age 14 may not be
formally employed but can perform informal jobs, such as
baby-sitting, on an occasional basis.
</P>
<P>
   The BLS study looked separately at agricultural work, finding
that teen-agers between 14 and 17 made up 7 percent of U.S. farm
workers between 1993 and 1998. About half of the estimated 126,000
minor farm workers live and work away from their parents.

<HEADLINE> Typhoons Kill 16 in Western Pacific  </HEADLINE>
By KOZO MIZOGUCHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Typhoons in the western Pacific unleashed deadly
floods, landslides and tornadoes in the Philippines on Friday, and
one threatened to strike Tokyo next.
</P>
<P>
   At least 16 people died and 10 were missing as a pair of
typhoons converged on the Philippines, bringing torrential rains
that forced 400,000 to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Schools and municipal buildings were overwhelmed by the
homeless, who are likely to need shelter for up to a week, said
James Sian, manager of national disaster relief in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   ''It isn't far-fetched to say that our supplies will run out,''
Sian said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the storms was moving northeast at 25 miles per hour,
away from the Philippines but directly toward the heavily populated
coastal areas around Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's Meteorological Agency forecast that Typhoon Kirogi, with
sustained winds of 78 miles per hour, will reach land by Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a typhoon scored a direct hit on the Japanese
capital was in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Waves up to 13 feet high could slap the coast, and up to 10
inches of rain could fall in the Tokyo area through Saturday,
causing flooding and landslides, forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   The typhoon's approach prompted Japan's three major airlines to
cancel at least 50 domestic flights in and out of Tokyo on
Saturday, Kyodo News agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   On the island of Kozushima southeast of Tokyo, which stands
directly in the storm's path, 788 residents fled to a school on
higher ground, said Yutaka Shimizu, a local government official.
</P>
<P>
   The other storm off the Philippines, Typhoon Kai-tak, was about
375 miles southeast of Hong Kong at 9 p.m. Friday local time and
expected to remain nearly stationary overnight, the Hong Kong
Observatory said.
</P>
<P>
   A third typhoon formed Friday in the South China Sea from a
tropical storm and was tracked heading for mainland China,
meteorologists said.

<HEADLINE> Harry Potter's magic working magic on magic  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Harry Potter is working magic on magicians,
who are thrilled to see little imaginations embracing the fictional
tyke's world of special powers.
</P>
<P>
   With television and the Web exposing tricks of the trade like
never before, the young orphan with magical skills is a reminder of
what makes magic so - magical, members of the International
Brotherhood of Magicians said at their annual convention Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''With all the exposure and everybody on the Internet wanting to
find out how things are done, so little is done to spark the
imagination and joy in children,'' said Abb Dickson, a past
president of the brotherhood. ''That's what the Harry Potter series
does. You can pretend once more and believe once more.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Harry Potter has done so much for magic,'' said Dickson,
president of the World Alliance of Magicians.
</P>
<P>
   The merchandising that is sure to follow from the astounding
success of J.K. Rowling's series will only further advance the
craft, dealers demonstrating their wares at the convention said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You'll see Harry Potter magic sets, Harry Potter magic books
and that will have a profound effect,'' said Richard Kaufman,
editor and publisher of Genii magazine. ''Anything that makes
little new magicians is good for magic.''
</P>
<P>
   The fourth book in the Harry Potter series, ''Harry Potter and
the Goblet of Fire,'' was being released at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Long before there was Harry Potter's goblet, there was Harry
Houdini's Chinese water torture cell. But even Houdini's niece
recognizes the appeal of the younger Harry. While Marie Blood's
taste in mysteries runs more toward Perry Mason, ''I am waiting to
see it,'' she said of the latest Harry Potter book while signing
autographs after regaling an audience with tales of her famous
uncle. The escape artist died in 1926, when she was 8 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Potter was not far from the thoughts of 7-year-old Ariel
Chaudhuri and her mother, Gretchen, at the convention. Ariel is on
her second adventure and looking forward to others.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw an act the other night, a magician who used bubbles,
and thought he would be a perfect Harry Potter character,''
Gretchen Chaudhuri said. ''He acted just like Harry Potter would.''

<HEADLINE> Teen-ager's death appears to be isolated case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The death of a 17-year-old from bacterial
meningitis last Saturday appears to be an isolated case, Gloucester
County health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Deptford Township High School student, whose name was not
released, first became ill last Friday night while visiting in Cape
May County.
</P>
<P>
   Friends took her to Burdette Tomlin Memorial Hospital in Cape
May Courthouse last Saturday. She was transferred to Children's
Hospital of Philadelphia, where she later died, according to Louis
Lamanna, Cape May County health officer and public health
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   While it's unknown how the girl contracted the disease, health
officials said no other cases were reported in the county or
surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
   The case was first reported in Cape May County, but Gloucester
County health officials are handling the investigation since that
is where the girl lived.
</P>
<P>
   Although she attended summer school at Deptford, it's unlikely
classmates were exposed to the bacteria because no classes were
scheduled during the Fourth of July holiday, Chad Bruner,
Gloucester County health department director, told the Philadelphia
Inquirer in Friday's editions. As a precaution, the teen-ager's
friends and family were treated with antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Bacterial meningitis strikes the brain and spinal membranes and
can be cured if treated early. Symptoms, which include high fever,
vomiting, severe headaches and stiff neck, may not appear for 10
days after exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Most people often don't realize they have been infected until
they are sick.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just sneaks up on you,'' Bruner said.
</P>
<P>
   Meningitis is spread through close contact with infected
individuals. Anyone who suspects they have been exposed to the
disease should seek medical assistance immediately.

<HEADLINE> NY Times To Debut Kids' Book List  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Times Book Review will start a
best-seller list for children's books on July 23.
</P>
<P>
   The list of 15 best sellers will include all categories of
children's hardcover books, including fiction and nonfiction,
picture books and ''chapter'' books, those that are longer and have
more text, the Times said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It joins the Book Review's best-seller lists for fiction,
nonfiction, ''advice, how-to and miscellaneous'' and separate lists
for paperbacks in those categories.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sales and popularity of children's books can rival and, in
the case of the Harry Potter books, even exceed those of adult
books,'' noted Charles McGrath, editor of the Book Review, which
appears each Sunday. ''With a separate children's list we can more
fully represent what people are reading, and we can clear more room
on the adult list for adult books.''
</P>
<P>
   One or more of the three books in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter
series have commanded spots on the adult fiction best-seller list
for 81 weeks to date.
</P>
<P>
   The children's list will be derived from the same sources as the
adult list, including a sample drawn from 4,000 bookstores and
wholesalers that sell to some 50,000 outlets. Sales from children's
bookstores will also soon be factored into the rankings.
</P>
<P>
   The Book Review's best-seller list pages will be redesigned,
putting the new children's list in the place of the ''advice and
how-to'' hardcover list below the adult hardcover list. ''Advice
and how-to'' will move to the paperback best-seller page.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> US Asks Haiti To Remedy Flawed Votes  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department on Friday renewed its
criticism of Haiti's May parliamentary elections and said it is not
too late for the country to take remedial action.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Richard Boucher said a runoff election in Haiti set
for Sunday is ''incomplete and inadequate'' because no Senate seats
will be at stake in the balloting. He declined to say whether
sanctions are being contemplated.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher indicated it may not be possible to take corrective
action by Sunday's runoff, but said such steps could be taken later
on.
</P>
<P>
   ''The failure of the Haitian government and the electoral
authorities to use the proper method in determining winners in the
Senate election certainly calls into question the credibility of
the entire Haitian election process,'' Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   He said a flawed counting method gave many Senate candidates an
undeserved victory in the first round. They were declared the
winners even though they fell short of the 50 percent legally
required for victory, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher noted that the U.N. Security Council president issued a
statement Thursday calling on the Haitian authorities to adhere to
their own electoral law.
</P>
<P>
   He also commended Haiti's Caribbean neighbors for pressing the
Haitian government to resolve the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties charge that the count from May 21 elections
was rigged to ensure a massive victory for the Lavalas Family party
of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. He is favored to win
November presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. aid program to Haiti involves $22 million worth of
humanitarian assistance for schools, feeding the hungry, and
planting trees.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
placed a hold on the entire aid program in April because he
objected to Haiti's confiscation of an American-owned rice company
in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   He recently decided to release his hold on the humanitarian
component because it isn't administered by the Haitian government.
But he kept a hold on $10 million in aid to support of the
electoral process.

	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - A letter carrier suffered a cut on
his head when an air conditioning unit fell from a second-story
window and landed on him, authorities said.

<HEADLINE> New York congressman uses clout to fight for extradition of fugitives </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - A New York congressman is flexing the nation's
financial muscle in hopes of forcing the Dominican Republic to
extradite two fugitives wanted for murder.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Benjamin Gilman, who heads the International Relations
Committee, is barring the transfer of a $3 million U.S. ship to the
impoverished Caribbean island over its refusal to hand over Pablo
Almonte, a man wanted for the 1988 slaying of a New York City cop.
The U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency was to transfer the
ship - a Balsam Class buoy tender - to Dominican officials this
month before Gilman put a halt to the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman, R-Middletown, had previously blocked millions
of dollars in humanitarian aid from reaching the Dominican Republic
because it has failed to extradite Carlos Grullon, charged with
killing his wife at the Tarrytown Hilton in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite promises from the Dominican Republic we haven't seen
any action,'' Gilman said in an interview Friday. ''As far as I'm
concerned we shouldn't be providing them with things like aid while
they harbor criminals wanted for the murder of constituents of
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilman said he only resorted to withholding aid after years of
fruitless diplomatic talks.
</P>
<P>
   While Congress routinely blocks aid, it is rare for a single
lawmaker to do so to get a criminal extradited, Gilman's spokesman
Lester Munson said.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman is one of only four U.S. lawmakers that have the power to
freeze foreign aid. The others are the chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee - Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina -
as well as the heads of the Senate and House subcommittees on
foreign aid appropriations.
</P>
<P>
   The Dominican Embassy had no immediate response Friday to
Gilman's actions.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Police Officer Michael Buczek, 24, was gunned down
in 1988 in the city's Washington Heights neighborhood after he and
his partner chased several people suspected of drug dealing from
the lobby of a building. After the shooting, Almonte - also known
as Pablo Almonte Lluberes - and another suspect, Daniel Mirambeaux,
fled to the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Mirambeaux was apprehended in Santo Domingo, the Dominican
capital, but leapt to his death before he could be extradited to
New York to face a first-degree murder charge, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Almonte has been indicted in absentia on a charge of
second-degree murder by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Almonte is the brother of a high-ranking Dominican police
official, Munson said. He has never been found.
</P>
<P>
   In the other case Gilman is pushing, Grullon was indicted by a
grand jury in Westchester County in December 1991 on charges he
killed his estranged wife, Yolina Camacaho. Police say Grullon shot
Camacho in front of several witnesses, including the couple's two
young children in the basement of the Hilton. Camacho worked there
as a housekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Grullon also fled to the Dominican Republic. He was arrested and
spent several months in jail there before being released on bail.
He hasn't been seen since.
</P>
<P>
   A Dominican court has tried and convicted Grullon in absentia
for the murder and his bail violation, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The roughly $6 million in aid money Gilman blocked is intended
for programs to further democracy and human rights. At the request
of the Dominican government, Gilman did allow $1.5 million for AIDS
prevention and the presidential election to go to the island.
</P>
<P>
   Donald McHenry, a professor at Georgetown University's School of
Foreign Service who specializes in developing countries, said the
practice of unilaterally blocking foreign aid is becoming more
common in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''The danger is you have 535 secretaries of state each making
decisions based on the individual needs of their constituents,''
McHenry said. ''It's not the best way to run foreign policy.''

<HEADLINE> OSHA cites construction company for accident that killed two  </HEADLINE>
dshofonssy
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILFORD, Conn. (AP) - The federal government Friday cited a
construction company in the collapse of a steel structure that
killed two workers and injured two others.
</P>
<P>
   The Occupational Health and Safety Administration said Black &AMP;
Veatch did not follow established procedures to erect the steel
structure. OSHA proposed a $7,000 fine against the company.
</P>
<P>
   The structure was meant to house a steam generator for a power
plant. It collapsed in February and took down a nearby crane,
killing boilermakers Kevin Winslow, 43, of Newington, and Wayne
Most, 38, of West Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Crane operator Robert Fitch, of North Branford, was trapped in
the rubble for eight hours and lost a leg. George Scrivner of East
Haddam also was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators found that a diagonal brace on the
structure was prematurely removed, leaving the structure vulnerable
to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ''If proper erection procedures had been adhered to, this
structure would not have collapsed,'' said Clifford Weston, OSHA's
area director.
</P>
<P>
   Black &AMP; Veatch officials have not yet received the full OSHA
report at their Kansas City, Mo. headquarters, but they were
briefed on the agency's findings Thursday, said company spokesman
John Allen.
</P>
<P>
   ''Til we've had an opportunity to review and fully evaluate the
written citation, it would really be inappropriate for us to offer
further comment,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   Site manager Brent Freeman refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Under OSHA rules, the company has 15 days to respond to the
investigation's findings.
</P>
<P>
   The citation was for a serious violation - the second-highest
level of citation OSHA issues. The maximum fine allowed by law for
a serious violation is $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   The company committed another serious violation in August 1999
for an injury to a worker at a power plant construction site in
Agawam, Mass. The company paid a $4,038 fine, OSHA said.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Fitch, whose husband was injured in the Milford accident,
said she is interested in reading the OSHA report.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors had to amputate part of Robert Fitch's right leg to just
above the knee, but they were able to save his left leg. He was
released from the hospital May 25 and still goes for physical
therapy to learn how to use his prothesis and get around.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as his recovery goes, it's very slow and painful,''
Joan Fitch said Friday. ''Mentally, he's still being very
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last month with the New Haven Register, Fitch,
62, said he still hopes to get back on the job someday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I derive the greatest pleasure from operating a crane, just
being in the cab and doing my own thing,'' he said. ''My focus is
to get the pain under control so I can get back to it.''

<HEADLINE> Two people robbed in separate Central Park robberies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Two people - one a tourist from Israel - were
robbed in broad daylight Friday near heavily traveled locations in
Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   There were no serious injuries, and police were searching for
the suspects. The robberies did not immediately appear to be
related, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The first robbery occurred at 6:40 a.m. at 62nd Street and East
Drive, near the Central Park Zoo area. James Jonest, 43, of
Manhattan, was approached by two men who punched him in the face
and stomach, taking $253 in cash and his black work jacket that
said ''Rockefeller Center'' on it. Jonest was taken to a nearby
hospital for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Police did not know Jonest's occupation; telephone calls to the
two public relations firms that represent Rockefeller Center were
not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   The second robbery occurred at 11:05 a.m. at 74th Street and
East Drive, near the Central Park Boathouse. Mae Benhur, 23,
visiting from Israel, told police she was approached by a man who
demanded her money. He said he had a gun but did not display one,
Benhur told police.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect took Benhur's CD player, $20 in cash, and a $100
American Express traveler's check, police said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Ethnic Albania Rebel Leader Hurt  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A former Kosovo Liberation Army
commander was wounded Friday in a shootout with supporters of an
ethnic Albanian political rival, witnesses and sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Ramush Haradinaj was traveling before dawn with a relative, Daut
Haradinaj, when the two were attacked in the Kosovo village of
Streoce, said sources in Haradinaj's political party, the Alliance
for the Future of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the gunbattle were in dispute, but the incident
raises concern about political violence within the ethnic Albanian
community.
</P>
<P>
   Ramush Haradinaj, a former KLA commander-turned-politician, was
taken to the U.S. military hospital at Camp Bondsteel following the
early morning incident, which occurred in the western village of
Streoce. NATO spokesman Maj. Scott Slaten said Haradinaj's
condition was stable.
</P>
<P>
   Daut Haradinaj, who was also injured, is a sector commander of
the Kosovo Protection Force, which was organized as a civil
emergency unit after the KLA was officially disbanded last year.
</P>
<P>
   When the protection corps was organized last year, NATO assured
both the Kosovo Serb community and international governments that
its officers would be placed under strict control and that the
organization would be involved exclusively in humanitarian work and
disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
   However, U.N. sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
disputed the version of the attack released by Ramush Haradinaj's
party. They refused to give their own account because the case is
under investigation by U.N. civilian police.
</P>
<P>
   In Streoce, however, Sadik Musa claimed the Haradinajs and some
of their followers attacked their home about 1 a.m. with automatic
weapons. Musa told Associated Press Television News that he and his
relatives returned fire, wounding the two Haradinajs.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke in front of his home, which was pocked with bullet
holes. Italian peacekeepers and U.N. police stood guard outside the
walled compound, where two bullet-riddled cars were parked and
bloodstains were visible on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Musa and his supporters said the attack was launched because
they support Haradinaj's rivals in the Democratic League of Kosovo,
led by Ibrahim Rugova. Musa said Ramush Haradinaj abducted his
brother last year because he was fighting in a rival ethnic
Albanian militia led by Bujar Bukoshi, who is a member of Rugova's
party.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wants to win the election in Kosovo by force, by killing
his rivals,'' another man in the compound, Beslim Balaj, said of
Haradinaj.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press telephoned Ramush Haradinaj's party for
comment on the allegations but was told no spokesman was available.
</P>
<P>
   Ramush Haradinaj was a leading commander in the ethnic Albanian
guerrilla army during the 18-month conflict with the Serbs that
prompted NATO military intervention last year.
</P>
<P>
   After the conflict ended and NATO-led peacekeepers replaced Serb
forces here, Haradinaj organized what is believed to be the
third-largest political party in the ethnic Albanian community.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Haradinaj scuffled with Russian peacekeepers and got a
black eye after they stopped him at a checkpoint. He was briefly
detained after two weapons were found in his car without proper
paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   NATO said he had attempted to flee and that peacekeepers and
military police ''subdued him.''

<HEADLINE> Yale study examines links between schizophrenia and smoking  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - A Yale School of Medicine study is
expanding upon what scientists know about the link between
schizophrenia and nicotine addiction.
</P>
<P>
   The study may help scientists develop drugs to treat
schizophrenia and to help people stop smoking, said Dr. Tony
George, the lead author of the study.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we can develop drugs that act like nicotine but don't have
associated problems, then we might be on to a new family of
antischizophrenia drugs,'' George said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have long noticed that almost all schizophrenics are
heavy smokers. They have tried to find out why so they might
understand what is going on in a schizophrenic's brain.
</P>
<P>
   In schizophrenics, cognitive functions in the higher part of the
brain are impaired, leading them to have trouble with memory,
concentration and reason.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the dopamine, or ''reward'' pathways in the
lower part of their brains, are operating on overtime, making them
susceptible to addictions and risky behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that too little dopamine activity is going on in
the front of the brain, where the cognitive functions lie. This
leads to too much dopamine activity in the lower part of the brain,
leading to paranoia, addictions and compulsions, George said.
</P>
<P>
   The study, using rats, showed how both dopamine pathways in the
brain are linked to other reward pathways called opioid pathways.
</P>
<P>
   Both kinds of pathways are receptive to nicotine. By smoking,
schizophrenics may be stimulating activity in those pathways and
improving their cognitive ability.
</P>
<P>
   When rats were injected with a substance that blocks opioid
systems, the nicotine's effects also were blocked.
</P>
<P>
   George said the finding shows the link between the two systems
and raises the possibility that drugs could be developed to exploit
it.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there's a common biological explanation to nicotine
addiction and schizophrenia, related to opiate pathways, maybe a
drug to block opiate pathways would be effective in treating
nicotine addiction and schizophrenia,'' George said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gregory Dalack, who also has studied the affects of smoking
on schizophrenics at the veterans hospital in Ann Arbor, Mich. and
the University of Michigan, said this study adds to the
understanding of the complicated interaction between nicotine and
the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a complicated system,'' Dalack said. ''A great deal of
this still needs to be understood. These animal models are helping
to tease out what is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was funded in part by the National Alliance for
Research on Schizophrenia and Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully, what comes out of this is there will be a chemical,
a treatment that will help them maintain a more comfortable
personality,'' said Constance Lieber, president of the group.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institute of Drug Abuse and the National Institute
of Mental Health also helped fund the study, which appears in this
month's issue of the journal Neuropsychopharmacology.

<HEADLINE> Federal government approves $15 million for mudslide repair  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BETHLEHEM, N.Y. (AP) - The Federal Highway Administration has
approved $15 million in emergency funds to help pay the costs
wrought by a May mudslide, Gov. George E. Pataki announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The funds will help restore a main road between this town and
the city of Albany, at least partially closed since the May 16
slide along the Normans Kill Creek. The money also will be used to
relocate the creek's channel to protect the road in the future,
refund costs incurred by emergency services and relocate Albany's
waterline crossing.
</P>
<P>
   A 300-foot chunk of earth slid north into the rain-swelled
Normans Kill. Three days later, a produce market tumbled off the
edge and other businesses and residents have been affected by the
slide.
</P>
<P>
   DOT engineers have been working since to completely reopen the
roadway.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said he is still pressing the Clinton administration to
release emergency funding to help businesses hurt by the landslide.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency rejected the initial
request for that funding but Pataki has appealed.

<HEADLINE> BC-NJ--Rabbis Wedding, 610  </HEADLINE>
By BRETT MARTEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) - It's a ''takeover by the rabbis,'' laughed
Rabbi David Goldstein, before, on a more sincere note, commenting
that he was about to take part in a rabbi's dream wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the domed sanctuary of historic Touro Synagogue on
Friday, Goldstein's son, Ari, who is also a rabbi, married Hanna
Yerushalmi, herself both a rabbi and a rabbi's daughter. Both the
bride and groom serve congregations in the Philadelphia area: She
is associate rabbi at Congregation Beth Or in Spring House, Pa.; he
works about 35 miles away, at Congregation M'Kor Shalom in Cherry
Hill, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   There were more than a dozen rabbis in the audience, including
the groom's uncle, Joshua Goldstein, who has a congregation in New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The rabbi fathers of the bride and groom jointly performed the
ceremony in the reform temple that dates back to 1909.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Zola, a Jewish history professor at Hebrew Union College in
Cincinnati, where the couple also met, said the wedding appeared to
be the first known marriage of two rabbis whose fathers also were
rabbis. Of course, Zola was able to eliminate more than 5,700 years
of Jewish history since women were not permitted to be ordained as
rabbis until about three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   For Hanna, 31, and Ari, 30, the wedding may have made history
but wasn't meant to attract much fanfare. They kept the guest list
down to about 35. Having their fathers preside over the ceremony
simply made the union more memorable, Yerushalmi said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ari and I perform weddings and know the routine and we needed
something to push it over the edge and make it more than routine
for us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The groom is from New Orleans, where his father is the rabbi at
Touro Synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   The uniqueness of the ceremony was evident in several instances,
such as when the couple's parents held the four corners of the
tallit, a ceremonial cloth, above the heads of the bride and groom.
It's a tradition in which officiating rabbis do not usually take
part, never mind two of them at once.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll have one hand up here and one over there,'' directing the
ceremony, said Rabbi Isaac Yerushalmi, who has another daughter
married to a rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Yerushalmi, who grew up in Istanbul, Turkey, and is
now a professor at Hebrew Union, incorporated rituals into the
ceremony associated with Sephardic, Middle Eastern Jews, while the
elder Goldstein presided over portions of the ceremony linked to
Ashkenazi, or European Jewish traditions.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the bride stood on a gold colored carpet while a
wedding song that originated in Greece was sung in Ladin
(pronounced la'DEEN), a folk language of Sephardic Jews, much as
Yiddish is for Ashkenazis.
</P>
<P>
   Isaac Yerushalmi also drew up the wedding contract in Aramaic, a
language commonly used by Jews throughout history, even more so
then Hebrew, the rabbi said. Yerushalmi wore traditional Sephardic
garb, including a white robe with lace running down the center from
the collar, and a larger yarmulke which stands more vertically with
a flat top. Goldstein wore the dome-shaped skull cap more commonly
worn by European and American rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   The groom acknowledged he was excited about participating in a
moment of Jewish history but hadn't really considered it until he
and his new bride began discussing wedding plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''At first we were joking about how many rabbis would show up
and then we thought, 'We better be careful about this. It could be
the first time this has ever happened,''' Ari Goldstein said. ''But
it's really about Hanna and how great she is, and when it comes
down to it, I'm just a groom and she's just a bride.''

<HEADLINE> 'Harry Potter' Hysteria in England  </HEADLINE>
By AUDREY WOODS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- While truckloads of the top-secret ''Harry Potter
and the Goblet of Fire'' sped along Britain's highways Friday to
shops around the land, bookstores invited youngsters to bring
sleeping bags and await the first official sale -- at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before Harry Potter's new adventure burst upon a waiting
world, it was hard to tell who was more excited -- the book industry
or the throngs of youngsters whose genuine eagerness to read it
created a marketer's dream.
</P>
<P>
   But with the hefty new tome firmly in their grasp, the kids will
have the edge.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're really, REALLY looking forward to it,'' 11-year-old
friends Natasha Cook and Eva Arevuo said almost in unison Friday
afternoon at a Books Etc. branch in north London.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not so realistic that they're boring,'' Natasha said,
trying to explain the Potter books' appeal. The adventures of the
orphaned wizard, Harry, at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
Wizardry are filled with humor, suspense, monsters, ghosts and
magical characters.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's always got lots of surprises in it,'' Eva said.
</P>
<P>
   While waiting for the new book -- fourth in the series -- to go on
sale, children at Waterstone's bookshop in Piccadilly Circus were
given an ''I waited for Harry'' T-shirt and entertained by a
magician. Waterstone's shops in Glasgow, Scotland, and Birmingham
and Leeds, England, arranged sleepovers, too.
</P>
<P>
   In Aberdeen, Scotland, staff at Ottakars bookshop was renamed
''Pottakars'' for a midnight opening, and staff were dressed up as
witches and wizards.
</P>
<P>
   At the Glasgow Waterstone's, events manager Kim Hardie called
the response to the new book ''absolutely mental'' and said,
''about 80 percent of my time in the last fortnight (two weeks) has
been spent dealing with Harry Potter queries.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Borders shop in Glasgow, Simon Biggam said children will
be offered a Saturday breakfast of Muggle muffins and fizzy
cocktails.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've never known anything like it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Amazon.co.uk Internet site promised customers their
pre-ordered copies would go in the mail Friday, with the goal of
getting them delivered by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Staff at the company's Milton Keynes distribution center in
southern England worked through the night to ensure that about
65,000 copies were ready to ship.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon expects to send 53 tons, or 41.6 million pages worth, of
the book to British readers.
</P>
<P>
   Although it may not have the old-fashioned music of cash
registers ringing in its ears, the U.S. Amazon.com site had totted
up more than 300,000 sales -- more than six times the prepublication
record set in March by John Grisham's latest novel, ''The
Brethren.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' occupied the top spot on
the best seller lists of both sites.
</P>
<P>
   The first print run by the book's British and U.S. publishers
totaled 5.3 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   Author J.K. Rowling was too busy last year writing this book to
do much publicity for ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,''
the third book in the series.
</P>
<P>
   This time, she's doing book signings on a promotional tour that
sets off on a Hogwarts Express train from ''Platform 9 3/4'' at
King's Cross station, where the boy wizard and his friends embark
each year on their way to adventures.
</P>
<P>
   At 640 pages in Britain and 752 pages in the U.S. edition, the
new book is double the size of ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of
Azkaban,'' which was greeted with similar excitement when it was
released. It sold 64,000 copies in hardback in its first 2&AMP;frac12; days.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the U.S. bookstore chain Barnes and Noble said it
already had 360,000 pre-orders and expected to break records for
first-day and first-week sales for any book in the company's
history.
</P>
<P>
   Together, its retail stores and Web site already have received
more than 360,000 pre-orders, more than 10 times the number of
pre-orders for any previous book.
</P>
<P>
   Like Waterstone's in Britain, many Barnes and Noble stores are
staying open past midnight to accommodate fans, and planning
special parties with costumes and refreshments.

<HEADLINE> Paroli gets 21 months  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - William Paroli Sr., the former
Dutchess County Republican chairman, was sentenced Friday to 21
months in federal prison for running an extortion scheme, part of
the web of scandal enveloping Poughkeepsie in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   ''You sold out the citizens of Poughkeepsie, whom you were
obliged to serve,'' Judge Barrington Parker told Paroli as the
court imposed a $5,000 fine and $19,300 in restitution.
</P>
<P>
   Parker also sentenced Paroli to two years of probation after his
prison term.
</P>
<P>
   Paroli, 72, was ordered to surrender Aug. 21. Parker said he
would recommend a prison near Paroli's home and Paroli thanked him
for his ''understanding and compassion.'' His voice breaking, he
also apologized ''to my family for the embarrassment I caused
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Paroli admitted in February that he conspired to extort payments
from companies doing business in the Town of Poughkeepsie.
According to the 19-count indictment against him, developers and
other businesses were shaken down by town officials working with
Paroli for payoffs that could tally $5,000 or $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal has also embroiled the town's former water
superintendent, who was sentenced to 33 months for conspiracy, and
is awaiting trial for allegedly murdering the town's personnel
director.
</P>
<P>
   The town assessor was also found dead as the extortion
investigation began. He apparently committed suicide, officials
have said.
</P>
<P>
   Paroli's attorney, Andrew Rubin, beseeched the judge to sentence
Paroli below federal guidelines, which called for 18 to 24 months.
He said Paroli had already been disgraced and had given up his job
as county elections commissioner. Paroli suffers from prostate
cancer, depression, ulcers, hearing loss, two knee replacements and
a shoulder injury caused by a fall from a tractor, the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge said he had already taken it all into
consideration. If not for Paroli's age and cancer, Parker said, ''I
would have dealt with you substantially more harshly.''
</P>
<P>
   Paroli's imprisonment, fine and restitution, Rubin argued, could
endanger his wife's ability to make ends meet. In response, the
judge said Paroli could put off payment of the restitution until
two years after his release.
</P>
<P>
   Paroli would not comment after the sentencing. Prosecutor Cari
Robinson also declined to comment.

<HEADLINE> Panel Issues Rwanda Genocide Report  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- In a scathing indictment of the failure to
halt the worst genocide since World War II, an international panel
on Friday blamed the U.N. Security Council, the United States,
France and the Catholic Church for failing to prevent the slaughter
of more than 500,000 Rwandans.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-member panel created by the Organization of African
Unity called for the international community -- especially those
countries that failed to prevent or help stop the 1994 genocide --
to pay reparations to Rwanda ''in the name of both justice and
accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   The 90-day genocide, orchestrated by a small group of Hutu
extremists against the Tutsi minority, followed a mysterious plane
crash that killed Rwanda's President Juvenal Habyarimana. More than
half a million Tutsis and thousands of moderate Hutus were killed
in the slaughter, which ended when Tutsi-led rebels defeated the
Hutu extremists in July 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The OAU report is harsh in assessing blame, repudiating France's
contention that it bears no responsibility for the genocide and
President Clinton's insistence that the United States failed to act
because of ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   ''A small number of major actors could directly have prevented,
halted, or reduced the slaughter. They include France in Rwanda
itself; the U.S. at the Security Council; Belgium, whose soldiers
knew they could save countless lives if they were allowed to remain
in the country; and Rwanda's church leaders,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference launching the 318-page report, former
Canadian ambassador and panel member Stephen Lewis said the United
States knew exactly what was going on -- but blocked the Security
Council from deploying an effective U.N. force because it had lost
18 U.S. soldiers in Somalia five months earlier and didn't want to
become embroiled in Africa again.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's simply beyond belief that because of Somalia hundreds of
thousands of Rwandans needlessly lost their lives,'' he said. ''I
don't know how Madeleine Albright lives with it.'' At the time, the
U.S. secretary of state was America's ambassador to the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher, when
asked about this comment, said Albright ''has talked about the
difficulty at the time she felt of being the U.S. representative at
the U.N. and her feeling that we should have done more.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also made quite clear during his 1998 trip to Rwanda
that ''the international community, together with the nations in
Africa, must bear a share of responsibility for the tragedy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
declined to comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan in a statement called the report
another important contribution to shedding more light on the Rwanda
genocide and to grappling ''with the complex challenges of
preventing genocide.''
</P>
<P>
   A French Foreign Ministry in Paris noted that two French panels
have already reported on Rwanda and said the government would study
the OAU report. ''We agree to look truth in the face and to draw
lessons from this genocide,'' in the field of conflict prevention,
for example, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican's U.N. observer mission said it had no comment on
the report.
</P>
<P>
   The panel concluded that France was closer than any other
government to the Habyarimana regime and knew what was happening,
but did nothing to stop the genocide before it began.
</P>
<P>
   Like the French government, the Catholic and Anglican
hierarchies were blamed by the panel for failing to use ''their
unique moral position among the overwhelmingly Christian population
to denounce ethnic hatred and human rights abuses.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations had a 2,500-strong peacekeeping mission in
Rwanda when the genocide began, but governments pulled out all but
a few hundred troops after 10 Belgian peacekeepers were killed.
</P>
<P>
   An independent report on the U.N. role in the genocide,
commissioned by Annan, concluded in December that the organization
and its members lacked the political will and resources to prevent
or stop the genocide.
</P>
<P>
   It cited the Security Council failures, but the OAU report is
far less diplomatic in blaming the key players.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda's U.N. Ambassador Joseph Mutaboba told reporters after
the press conference that ''for the first time we have heard what
we knew was true -- and it has been said in very crude terms.''
</P>
<P>
   The report traces the roots of the genocide back to Rwanda's
colonial rulers from Germany, and then Belgium, who along with
Catholic missionaries fueled ethnic divisions by fostering the
belief that the country's minority Tutsis were superior to its Hutu
majority.
</P>
<P>
   It then links the genocide to the current unrest in central
Africa, particularly the civil war in Congo, where the Security
Council has delayed deployment of a peacekeeping mission because of
continued violations of a 1999 cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   The panel called on Annan to establish a commission to determine
a formula for paying reparations to Rwanda and to identify which
countries have an obligation to pay them.
</P>
<P>
   The report notes that the United States, the United Nations,
Belgium and the Anglican church have apologized for their failures
in Rwanda -- but not France or the Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   The other panel members were Former Botswana President Ketumile
Masire, former Mali President Toumani Toure, former Liberian
minister Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, former Indian Supreme Court Chief
Justice P.N. Bhagwati, Algerian Senator Hocine Djoudi, and Lisbet
Palme, head of the Swedish Committee for UNICEF and widow of
assassinated Prime Minister Olof Palme.

<HEADLINE> Six Wounded in Haiti Vote Violence  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Supporters of a losing mayoral
candidate in Haiti went on a rampage in a remote provincial town,
wounding 12 people and setting houses ablaze, a radio report said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the violence Thursday in Anse-d'Hainault, a coastal town of
29,000 on the tip of Haiti's southern peninsula, backers of losing
mayor Georges Simon ransacked Radio Rebelle, a community radio
station, and the home of its owner, Orelien Joachim, Radio Vision
2000 reported.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds also set fire to the house of Mayor-elect Necuel
Belcombe and wounded 12 people, who were hospitalized. In all six
houses were set ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   Belcombe ran under the banner of the five-party opposition
coalition known as Space for Concord in the June 11 election, the
radio said.
</P>
<P>
   Simon, the runner-up and outgoing mayor, was from the
left-leaning Effort at Solidarity to Build a National Popular
Alternative, which was allied with former President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide's party.
</P>
<P>
   ''Simon's victory had already been proclaimed when Wednesday, on
the basis of falsified tally sheets, the district election bureau
declared he had lost,'' party leader Kely Bastien told The
Associated Press in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is what provoked the rage of his supporters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, partisans of an independent mayoral candidate clashed
with supporters of the winning candidate from Aristide's Lavalas
Family party on Ile-a-Vache, an island of 12,000 people off Haiti's
southern coast.
</P>
<P>
   Two Aristide party members were killed and three houses were
burned down.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti has nine electoral districts. Eight of them held their
local and legislative elections on May 21, and the district of
Grand'-Anse, which includes the town of Anse-d'Hainault, held its
elections June 11.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties charge that the counting in the parliament
and local elections was skewed to ensure a massive victory for
Aristide, who is favored to win the November presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   The international community, including the United Nations and
the United States, have backed allegations that the counting was
irregular.
</P>
<P>
   A second round of balloting is set for Sunday despite a boycott
by almost all opposition parties and protests by the international
community.
</P>
<P>
   Official results from the first round show Lavalas winning 18 of
l9 contested seats in the 27-seat Senate and 29 seats in the
83-member House of Deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Since Aristide's party is leading in most of the 54 races to be
held Sunday, it is expected to win control of both houses of
Parliament.

<HEADLINE> Italy Tightens No-Smoking Law  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- For four years Italians have largely puffed away in
defiance of a national no-smoking law.
</P>
<P>
   It was not uncommon to see bank tellers lighting up behind signs
asking customers not to smoke, or passengers indifferently drawing
from cigarettes in airport no smoking areas.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, the Cabinet approved temporary measures aimed at
forcing Italians to take its ''No Smoking'' signs seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Under the measures, Italians who defy the bans will risk fines
of up to $150. Restaurant owners or office managers who fail to
enforce smoking bans will face even stiffer fines, up to $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   The bans will also be extended to almost all enclosed spaces,
public and private, including indoor cafes and restaurants, where
smoking is now unrestricted. As in the United States, parts of
restaurants can still be designated as smoking areas.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet decree also includes a provision for businesses to
appoint a kind of ''minder'' to see that no smoking takes place.
</P>
<P>
   It is now up to the Parliament to decide whether to turn the
measures, which expire before the end of the year, into law.
Spearheading support for the law is Italy's new health minister,
Umberto Veronesi, a doctor who is one of the country's foremost
cancer experts.
</P>
<P>
   Business organizations have promised to lobby hard against the
law, contending it would raise costs too much for hoteliers, eatery
and bar owners to set up separate smoking and nonsmoking areas.

<HEADLINE> Brooklyn funeral director admits using casino worker to hide winnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - A Brooklyn funeral director admitted Friday
that a casino worker helped him in a bid to avoid reporting
$200,000 he won playing blackjack.
</P>
<P>
   The competition between two casinos for the patronage of Stanley
J. Nieberg played a role in the scheme, records show.
</P>
<P>
   The worker, Louis Freedman, was a marketing host at Trump Taj
Mahal Casino, a job that often involves catering to high-rollers.
</P>
<P>
   State regulators in 1999 revoked the casino licenses of Freedman
and a colleague at the casino, Ronald Citta, in connection with the
Nieberg matter.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Lewis A. Borinsky, who prosecuted
Nieberg, declined to comment on whether charges would be brought
against others.
</P>
<P>
   Nieberg, 47, said that the Taj Mahal and Caesars Atlantic City
Hotel and Casino both courted him by giving him free benefits,
known as ''comps.'' In court, he said he had been the owner of
Memorial Midwood Funeral Chapel for many years.
</P>
<P>
   He was gambling at Caesars in March 1996 and staying in a free
suite when he won the $200,000 and wanted to redeem his
$5,000-chips for cash, Nieberg told U.S. District Judge Stephen M.
Orlofsky.
</P>
<P>
   Casinos, as well as financial institutions, are required to file
currency transaction reports when dealing with more than $10,000 in
cash.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid that, Nieberg said he asked Freedman and others to help
structure the redemption of the chips.
</P>
<P>
   Nieberg said he gave Freedman four of the chips, and Freedman
gave two of the chips to a friend of his, to cash in such a way as
to avoid forcing Caesars to file a report. He did not name
Freedman's friend.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman and Citta lost their credentials because the Casino
Control Commission found they attempted to structure the
redemption, but it ultimately failed, and a report was filed, said
Katherine Lyons, a spokeswoman for the state Division of Gaming
Enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The commission found that Freedman redeemed the chips in a bid
to retain Nieberg as a Taj Mahal customer, commission spokesman Dan
Heneghan said.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman drove Citta over to Nieberg at Caesars, telling his
colleague, ''We've got a big fish on the hook,'' Heneghan said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission found that Freedman, licensed in May 1979, and
Citta, licensed in May 1981, knew the rules regarding cash
transactions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nieberg lawyer Kenneth F. Hense said his client thought he would
lose his comps because of the big win, and was afraid of being
robbed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the first time he ever won,'' Hense said. ''This was
just an aberrant type thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieberg, reached later, said he knew Freedman from prior
gambling trips. Nieberg said he is now an employee at the funeral
home.
</P>
<P>
   He was released on $100,000 bail pending sentencing Oct. 6,
where he faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on a
single charge of currency structuring. The actual penalties,
however, would be far less, based on federal sentencing guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The judge barred Nieberg from entering any gambling facility or
gambling on the Internet, Borinsky said.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Participants Seek Support  </HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Heading into a make-or-break U.S.-brokered
Mideast summit, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat campaigned to build support among their own
people Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's camp prepared to take to the streets for pro-peace
demonstrations, while Arafat made a bid for national consensus by
inviting 50 Palestinian leaders to accompany him to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   As the Tuesday start of the summit hosted by President Clinton
approaches, both leaders must contend with dwindling internal
support -- Barak from his increasingly fragile coalition, and Arafat
from ordinary Palestinians frustrated by long-stalled peace
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Despite threats from several of Barak's coalition partners to
bolt over concerns that he might make too-great concessions to the
Palestinians at the summit, the prime minister said he will not
sway from his mandate for peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the clear majority on the street,'' Barak said,
invoking his overwhelming electoral victory over hard-line former
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in May 1999. Barak insists he has
the support of the people even though recent polls have showed his
popularity slipping.
</P>
<P>
   At the presidential retreat of Camp David in rural Maryland,
Clinton hopes to forge a framework for a peace treaty. A final deal
is due Sept. 13 but the sides appear to be entrenched in widely
differing negotiating positions.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians demand a state in all the West Bank and Gaza
Strip with the Arab sector of Jerusalem as their capital, while
Israel says it is willing to cede most of the West Bank but wants
to keep the major Jewish settlement blocs under its control and
refuses to forfeit sovereignty over any part of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians say -- with qualifications -- that they plan to
declare independence on Sept. 13, unilaterally if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian Cabinet on Friday reiterated its determination
to ''establish an independent Palestinian state no matter how high
the price or steep the sacrifice,'' a Cabinet statement said.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting of the PLO Executive Committee later Friday evening
applauded Arafat for deciding to bring a delegation of 50 including
Palestinian leaders, lawyers, and technical staff to the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Among the delegates will be representatives from the Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a political faction that in
the past rejected peace efforts with Israel. Other factions from
the so-called Palestinian rejectionist camp declined Arafat's
invitation to accompany him to the summit.
</P>
<P>
   While only 12 members of the delegation will be permitted on the
grounds of Camp David, the others will be nearby for consultation,
Palestinian officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to Barak's coalition woes, the ultra-Orthodox Shas party
said Friday that unless the prime minister clarifies the parameters
in which he plans to negotiate in the upcoming summit, it too would
consider leaving the government.
</P>
<P>
   Two other parties in Barak's ruling coalition, the immigrants
party Israel B'Aliya and the National Religious Party have said
they would leave his government ahead of the summit.
</P>
<P>
   The potential departures of these parties could deprive Barak of
the broad consensus he says he needs to make peace.

<HEADLINE> Crow from New Rochelle tests positive for West Nile virus  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. (AP) - A crow found dead in New Rochelle last
month has tested positive for the West Nile virus, the first sign
of the disease in Westchester this season, the county Health
Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Other birds with the virus have been found in Rockland County
and in Bergen County, N.J., across the Hudson River from
Westchester, and Friday's finding ''is not totally unexpected,''
said Westchester Health Commissioner Joshua Lipsman.
</P>
<P>
   One of the seven New Yorkers killed by the virus last year was
from Westchester. The county, like most others in the region,
undertook a mosquito-killing campaign over the winter in hopes of
minimizing any outbreak this year.
</P>
<P>
   Health Department inspectors are studying whether the finding
means additional measures against mosquito larvae are needed,
Lipsman said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that despite the positive test on the crow - and a
''suspicious'' result on another dead bird - there is no indication
that more pesticide spraying is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer Westchester officials sprayed a pesticide from
helicopters in response to the disease, which was new to the
Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Lipsman noted that infected birds cannot transmit the virus to
people, who get it only from mosquitoes. The virus has yet to be
found in people this year but batches of mosquitoes are being
tested each week.
</P>
<P>
   West Nile virus can cause a range of symptoms. In the most
serious cases, infection can result in encephalitis, or swelling of
the brain, and can be deadly. The elderly and those with
compromised immune systems are most at risk.

<HEADLINE> Parents accused of tying up 3-year-old girl  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OLD BRIDGE, N.J. (AP) - The adoptive father of a 3-year-old girl
found tied up alone in an apartment Sunday is in the country
illegally, said police, who also are investigating the immigration
status of the child.
</P>
<P>
   The adoptive mother has an alien resident card, but Old Bridge
police are working with the National Center for Missing and
Exploited Children in Alexandria, Va., to investigate her claims
that Daniela Rojas was adopted three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're working with them to see if in fact it's true or not,''
said Old Bridge police Capt. Robert Bonfante. ''We have a lot of
leg work because (the parents) are not cooperating with us.''
</P>
<P>
   The adoptive father, Romero Simon Rojas, 29, has been charged
with endangering the welfare of a child. Police charged the girl's
adoptive mother, 34-year-old Aracelis Meregildo-Bostic, with child
endangering, criminal restraint and simple assault.
</P>
<P>
   Meregildo-Bostic and Rojas-Romero were released from the
Middlesex County jail Thursday after a bondsman posted $100,000
bail for each.
</P>
<P>
   The case began after a neighbor heard the child crying. An
officer responded to a call and saw Daniela Rojas on the parents'
apartment balcony with her ankles tied together by a nylon sock.
</P>
<P>
   The little girl suffered rope burns and bruises on her wrists
and ankles, police said. Authorities said she was under observation
at St. Peter's University Hospital in New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   She may be released to foster care with her three siblings as
early as this weekend, according to Laurie Facciarossa, a Division
of Youth and Family Services spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The couple are birth parents of three other children, a
3-year-old daughter, a 23-month-old son and a 3-month-old daughter.
DYFS took custody of those children after the parents were arrested
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Police said it looks like the girl was routinely tied up under
her crib by her parents before they went to work in the kitchen of
a nearby restaurant. It was unclear how she made her way onto the
balcony, police said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Postpones Aug. 5 Execution  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is postponing the first
federal execution since 1963 so the death row inmate can ask for
clemency under guidelines being updated by the government, the
White House said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given that nearly 40 years has passed since the last prisoner
was in this situation,'' the president ''wants new guidelines that
reflect the realities of today's judicial system and the realities
of today's federal capital cases,'' White House spokesman Jake
Siewert said.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Raul Garza is one of 21 people, including Oklahoma City
bomber Timothy McVeigh, on the federal death row at the U.S.
penitentiary in Terre Haute, Ind. The 43-year-old inmate is to be
executed by injection at 6 a.m. Aug. 5.
</P>
<P>
   He was convicted in August 1993 in Brownsville, Texas, for
killing three men between April 1990 and January 1991. A 10-count
indictment named him as the boss of a drug ring that imported tons
of marijuana into the United States between 1983 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president wants to make sure that Mr. Garza has a full
opportunity to submit a request for clemency, and that the
president, himself, has an opportunity to review that matter
completely,'' Siewert said, adding that the Justice Department
would complete the clemency guidelines in a week or so.
</P>
<P>
   The department also is studying whether racial minorities
unfairly get more federal death sentences than white offenders.
Two-thirds of the federal death row inmates are minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which is to be released this month, is expected to
reveal that more than three-quarters of the federal prosecutions
where the death penalty was sought have been against blacks,
Hispanics or other minorities, according to Sen. Russ Feingold,
D-Wis., who renewed his call on Friday to suspend all federal
executions.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold, along with Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D-Ill., and Sens.
Carl Levin, D-Mich., Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., and Tom Harkin,
D-Iowa, wrote a letter to Clinton on June 30 asking him to create a
national commission to review the fairness and accuracy of the
administration of the federal death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''It must ensure that the federal death penalty is applied in a
fair and just manner, sought against defendants free of even a hint
of racial bias,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Debate about the death penalty has been a touchstone in this
year's presidential campaign. Garza's imminent execution has swung
the spotlight on the issue to the Democrats after dogging Texas
Gov. George W. Bush last month.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Graham, who pleaded guilty to 10 aggravated robberies
during a crime spree in 1981, was executed in Texas late last month
after a series of unsuccessful appeals. Bush's state has put more
people to death in the past two decades than any other. This year,
23 inmates, including Graham, were executed. Executions, at the
rate of nearly one a week, will be held in Texas before Election
Day on Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said the governor believes the
death penalty deters crime, but Bush also ''understands the
complexity of each individual death penalty decision, and views
(the Garza) decision in that light.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Pennsylvania Friday, Vice President Al Gore, who
like Clinton supports the death penalty, said he supported efforts
to put clemency procedures in place. He said he shared Clinton's
concerns about the number of minorities receiving capital
punishment, but added: ''I have not yet seen evidence that would
justify a nationwide moratorium.''
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International USA, which staunchly opposes all
executions, also is calling for an immediate moratorium on federal
executions. The group praised Illinois Gov. George Ryan for his
decision in January to suspend executions in his state until a
state panel can determine whether the state is administering the
death penalty fairly and justly.	   ''We call on President Clinton to recognize
the inherent flaws
in the death penalty and to immediately institute a moratorium on
all federal executions,'' said William Schulz, executive director
of the group.

<HEADLINE> Assembly poised to consider school construction bill changes  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Two steps remain before New Jersey can
finally commence its long-awaited multibillion dollar school
construction program.
</P>
<P>
   But of those two steps, legislative final passage and the
governor's signature, only the last one is a slam dunk.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly, which is scheduled to meet Thursday, must agree
with changes made to the plan by Gov. Christie Whitman. Bill
supporters need 41 votes to send it back to her desk.
</P>
<P>
   But Assembly Democrats may not think the governor went far
enough to improve the original Assembly Republican version of the
bill, while Republicans may think she went too far and made it
worse.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is $6 billion for the state's so-called 30 special
needs school districts, and $2.6 billion for all the other schools.
The money is for replacing or renovating old, overcrowded school
buildings. The poor schools would receive full funding under a
state Supreme Court order; all other schools would get state grants
covering at least 40 percent of their costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate last week approved the governor's changes, which are
in the form of a conditional veto of the original Assembly bill.
The lower house last week postponed until July 13 voting to accept
or reject the changes.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Joseph Malone, R-Burlington, the sponsor of the
bill, said he has not spoken to his colleagues in recent days to
determine whether the new bill will attract the needed votes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll see what happens on Thursday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Assembly Democratic Leader Joseph V. Doria,
D-Hudson, said Friday he does not know how many members of his
party will support the bill. Only seven of the 35 Democrats voted
yes on the original version of the bill when it was before the
Assembly last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''Changes were made to the bill to make it more attractive to
some of our members. The question is, are there enough of them to
offset the loss of Republicans who are going to now come off the
bill,'' said Assembly Democratic spokesman Joe Donnelly.
</P>
<P>
   Doria earlier this week wrote a letter to Whitman warning her
not to take Democratic support for granted, as some claimed she did
in 1998 when she unsuccessfully pushed a gas tax hike to fund
highway and mass transit projects.
</P>
<P>
   Malone acknowledged that more of his Republican colleagues may
have concerns about the bill since the governor removed some
provisions popular with party members. For example, she stripped
the bill of legislative oversight of individual school projects in
the special needs districts.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he believes the bill will eventually pass.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it will pass. I think we have to do something,''
Malone said. ''We have to be responsible in fulfilling our
obligation. That does not mean the bill shouldn't be improved.''
</P>
<P>
   David Sciarra of the Education Law Center, which sued the state
on behalf of poor school children, is also confident the bill will
eventually pass.
</P>
<P>
   He said it does not bother him that lawmakers missed the state
Supreme Court's spring deadline to pass the bill to help the poor
schools.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Assembly postpones final passage further, ''then we
have a real serious problem,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Marines Issued Strict Rules  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL SMITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKINAWA CITY, Japan (AP) -- No liquor, a strict curfew, and
uniforms at all times: Those are the temporary rules laid down for
U.S. Marines on Okinawa after a serviceman was charged with
molesting a 14-year-old girl in her own bed.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of the Marine Corps announced the rules Friday,
saying they are meant to guarantee security during the Group of
Eight summit of industrial nations on Okinawa from July 21-23. He
said they were discussed before the 19-year-old U.S. Marine was
arrested Monday.
</P>
<P>
   However, the curfew and alcohol ban were not imposed on the Air
Force, Army or Navy units on this southern Japanese island, said
Eudith Rodney, chief spokeswoman for U.S. forces in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules come amid intense local anger over the molestation
case. Okinawans have held several small protests and rallies in
recent days, and the Marine commander, Lt. Gen. Earl B. Hailston,
has met with top elected officials in Okinawa and apologized.
</P>
<P>
   The case that started the uproar centers around a Marine lance
corporal based at Futenma Marine Corps Air Station.
</P>
<P>
   Police say the Marine is suspected of wandering into an unlocked
apartment in Okinawa City and creeping into the bed of the junior
high school student. The girl's mother, awakened by her screams,
says she found the drunk, half-naked Marine on top of the girl,
kissing and fondling her.
</P>
<P>
   The woman took her daughter from the room and called police, who
reporting finding the Marine asleep in the girl's bed. The
serviceman's name was withheld by police because people under age
20 are considered minors in Japan. The military has declined to
identify him.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, police charged the serviceman with indecency and
unlawful entry -- charges that carry up to seven years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Under a mutual security treaty between Japan and the United
States, about 47,000 U.S. military service people are stationed in
Japan, nearly two-thirds of them in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   Resentment of the U.S. presence on this island 1,000 miles
southwest of Tokyo is already substantial, with Okinawans
complaining about congestion, noise and crime. The trouble was
exacerbated by the 1995 rape of a 12-year-old girl by two Marines
and a Navy seaman. That crime sparked widespread demonstrations,
and the men were convicted.
</P>
<P>
   ''GIs get drunk on the cheap liquor in the military clubs and
they come off base and start problems, especially involving
women,'' 75-year-old shop owner Naoshi Katsuta said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's new Marine rules are meant to curtail problems, at
least during the G-8 summit. They are stricter than a 1 a.m. to 5
a.m. curfew the military leveled on its forces here after the 1995
rape and kept in place until last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, all Marines and sailors attached to the
eight U.S. Marine bases in Okinawa will be forbidden to drink
alcohol, on or off base, from July 20 to July 24. The service
members will also be required to wear uniforms wherever they are.
</P>
<P>
   From July 14-24, all Marines will be required to remain on their
bases, or in their off-base homes, in Okinawa after midnight. They
will only be able to leave after about 7:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton arrives at the G-8 summit, he is expected
to thank Okinawans for hosting the thousands of U.S. soldiers
stationed here. Nonetheless, the molestation case could increase
the intensity of demonstrations against the U.S. military presence.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said Friday that Clinton, in the first visit of
a U.S. president to the island, plans a speech to residents as well
as meetings with community leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman P. J. Crowley said Clinton would be prepared to deal
with the issue of complaints against U.S. troops when he attends
the summit.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something we view very seriously, and the military
command is working closely with local leaders'' on the
investigation of U.S. soldiers' conduct, Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a Tokyo-based feminist group, the Federation of
Japanese Women's Organizations, demanded a cut in U.S. military
bases on Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   ''The recurrence of such unforgivable crimes by U.S. soldiers is
extremely upsetting,'' the group's president, Fuki Kushida, said in
a statement. ''As long as U.S. bases exist there, our fear will
never end and violence against women will continue.''

<HEADLINE> American Bar Association talks diversity, Elian at annual meeting  </HEADLINE>
By DEEPTI HAJELA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The American Bar Association has taken some
steps to diversify the legal profession racially and ethnically,
but much more remains to be done, the organization's outgoing
president said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the group's annual meeting, President William G.
Paul pointed to an ABA scholarship program for minority law
students, which has raised $1.3 million since it was created last
year. Twenty students have been granted scholarships of $15,000,
$5,000 for each year of law school.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 percent of Americans are members of racial or ethnic
minorities, but the nation's lawyers are 92 percent white, Paul has
said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul also spoke of ABA programs that seek to steer minority law
school students to judicial clerkships. Groups such as the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People have complained
that minorities are less likely to be picked for such influential
positions.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we can place more people of diverse racial and ethnic
backgrounds, it will accelerate us toward our mission,'' Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   The annual meeting of the nation's largest lawyer's group runs
through Tuesday. Paul, of Oklahoma City, is being succeeded by
Martha Barnett, of Tallahassee, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting's panels touch on all aspects of law, including one
Friday that looked at how immigration law will deal with children
in the wake of the Elian Gonzalez case.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers included Gregory Craig, the attorney for Elian's
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez; and Jose Garcia-Pedrosa, who helped
represent the boy's Miami family.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing a question many have raised in the last several months,
the lawyers asked whether the immigration system set up to handle
asylum requests for adults could adequately deal with the needs of
children as young as 6-year-old Elian.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was found floating in an inner tube off the Florida
coast Thanksgiving Day and became the center of a custody battle
between the Miami relatives who cared for him when he landed in the
United States and his father from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives had sought asylum for the boy, but the INS
and U.S. courts rejected the request.

<HEADLINE> Clinton OKs 80,000 Refugees for 2001  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has authorized legal entry
into the United States for 80,000 refugees in fiscal 2001,
including some from the former Yugoslavia and Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo to the State Department on Friday, Clinton reduced the
entry levels for European refugees by 10,000 and increased levels
for African refugees by 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new authorization, 37,000 refugees would be allowed in
from Europe -- 20,000 from the former Yugoslavia and 17,000 from the
former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Another 6,000 are allowed entry from East Asia; 20,000 from
Africa; 10,000 from the Near East and South Asia; and 3,000 from
Latin America and the Caribbean. Another 4,000 slots were not
allocated.
</P>
<P>
   The 80,000 refugees to be allowed entry is 10,000 fewer than the
authorization for the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. In
fiscal 1999, the authorization was 78,000.
</P>
<P>
   Admissions are based on country-by-country allocations made each
year by the State Department. Applicants must prove valid fears of
persecution based on race, religion, membership in a particular
social group or political opinion.

Friday in the
proposed Democratic platform:
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
   --Knock down the barriers to fair trade. Enforce worker rights,
human rights and environmental protection in those agreements.
</P>
<P>
   --Work to repeal Republican Freedom to Farm Act that has resulted
in years of low prices and necessitated billion dollar bailouts.

   Education:
</P>
<P>
   --Have fully qualified, well-trained teachers in every classroom
-- and every teacher should pass a rigorous test to get there.
</P>
<P>
   --Every failing school in America should be turned around -- or
shut down and reopened under new leadership.
</P>
<P>
   --Ensure that no high school student graduates without mastering
the basics of reading and math.

<HEADLINE> Man Dies After Youth Hockey Game  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN McELHENNY
<TEXT>
<P>
   READING, Mass. (AP) -- It began as a fight about fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Two fathers, upset about rough play in their sons' youth hockey
game, came to blows, police say.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fathers was beaten into unconciousness -- in front of
some children -- and died a day later. And a man who faced a
misdemeanor charge of assault and battery for the fight now might
be charged with something much more serious.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Costin, a 40-year-old single father of four from
Lynnfield, was on the ice Wednesday afternoon at the Burbank Ice
Arena with a group of kids, including two of his own. Thomas Junta,
42, was in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   The hockey game was supposed to be non-contact, but Junta got
agitated when things got rough and some players began checking.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somebody may have struck or run into somebody on the ice,''
Lt. Detective Kevin Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Junta and Costin began arguing with one another, and a rink
manager threw Junta out because of the shouting, police said. But
by the time Costin took off his skates and left the ice, Junta was
back in the building.
</P>
<P>
   Junta, who police said is 6-foot-1 and weighs 275 pounds,
knocked Costin to the floor and with his fists pummeled Costin in
the head, police said. Another adult broke up the fight, but Costin
was unconscious. He died Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Junta had already faced charges of assault and battery.
</P>
<P>
   Middlesex district attorney Martha Coakley said it is possible
that new charges will be filed once investigators have received
results from an autopsy scheduled for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are now treating this death as a possible homicide,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Youth Alliance for Youth Sports, which teaches
parental ethics and monitors behavior at sporting events, said it
had never heard of a death resulting from a fight involving parents
at a youth sporting event.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Lapchick, director of the Center for the Study of Sports
and Society at Northeastern University, said he hears or reads at
least once a month about parents picking fights at their children's
games, either with referees, coaches or other parents.
</P>
<P>
   He said fighting has become more common over the past 5-10 years
as parents put increasing pressure on their children to succeed at
sports, particularly as a way of paving their way to college and
other achievements.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sadly does not come as a surprise that something like this
would happen,'' Lapchick said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think people are just horrified by it,'' said Town Manager
Peter Hechenbleikner. ''I always thought in Reading we didn't have
the typical Little League parent who goes screaming at the
umpire.''
</P>
<P>
   After the fight, the rink announced it was closing until July 8,
but since the death, the rink is closed indefinitely.

<HEADLINE> Vote Allows DC School Board Reform  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER ANDES
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A tally of absentee ballots Friday narrowly
pushed through a referendum in the nation's capital to switch from
an all-elected school board to one partially appointed by the
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment passed by 843 votes out of 40,662 ballots cast,
paving the way for Mayor Anthony A. Williams to appoint four of the
nine school board members. The referendum was held June 27, but the
absentee and special votes not counted till Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he's disappointed with the 12 percent voter
turnout but that the next step is for the city to pull together.
</P>
<P>
   ''To achieve our city's vision for a school system that works
for every student, we must garner the energy of the people who
spoke with their vote to energize the majority that did not,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents and opponents of the referendum have expressed
concern that the vote broke along racial and socio-economic lines.
Most voters in wards with heavy concentrations of black residents
opposed the referendum while voters in majority white wards
supported it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to see if the mayor holds true to his commitment to
reach out and provide healing for the district,'' said Larry Gray,
co-director of the Just Vote No committee.
</P>
<P>
   School Board Vice President William Lockridge called the
referendum, ''machine politics at its best.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all about the mayor wanting to control the whole city
from his office,'' Lockridge said.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum faces a final challenge in D.C. Superior Court. A
lawsuit argues the referendum should be thrown out, regardless of
the result, because the Council did not give the referendum two
readings.

<HEADLINE> Corruption Case Moving Toward Mayor  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL MELLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- A corruption scandal at City Hall has
moved closer than ever to Mayor Vincent ''Buddy'' Cianci Jr. with
the indictment of his former top aide on charges of arranging
bribes.
</P>
<P>
   So far, four city officials and two lawyers have been convicted
in the federal investigation, which became public 15 months ago.
Cianci has not been charged and has denied any knowledge of
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Frank E. Corrente became the highest-ranking city
official charged. He was accused of arranging bribes in connection
with city leases and contracts.
</P>
<P>
   More important: Corrente's indictment contains the first direct
allegations that tainted money went to Cianci.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cianci has always been seen as a hands-on mayor who knows
everything about what is going on in City Hall,'' said Darrell
West, a Brown University political science professor. ''Now his
defense is that he didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a federal judge rebuked Cianci during the sentencing
of two city tax officials who accepted bribes for tax reductions.
</P>
<P>
   The judge sentenced former tax board chairman Joseph Pannone to
five years in prison and former deputy tax assessor Rosemary Glancy
to two years and nine months, both for multiple counts of
conspiracy, attempted extortion and mail fraud. Pannone still faces
more charges related to the indictment of Corrente.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the mayor's two administrations, there has been more
corruption than in the history of the state,'' U.S. District Judge
Ronald Lagueux said at Pannone's sentencing. ''There is a feeling
in the city of Providence that corruption is tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Cianci countered: ''It was inappropriate, it was unfounded and
it was unfortunate that a sitting judge would level those charges
against me without any evidence or hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I deny any wrongdoing or any part in any of those situations
that he was sentencing defendants on today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cianci's second administration has witnessed Providence's
rebirth as a center for business, tourism and the arts, and
residents seem to believe in him. A Brown poll released last month
found that 67 percent thought Cianci was doing a good or excellent
job, versus 77 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Corrente resigned last July from his posts as supervisor of all
city departments and treasurer of the mayor's re-election
committee. He is accused of arranging bribes from a city
contractor, Anthony Freitas, who was working undercover for the
government.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, Freitas said he heard Pannone, the
former city tax board chairman, claim that Corrente and Cianci
received bribes from a property owner who was trying to win city
business.
</P>
<P>
   Corrente's lawyer, Howard Gutman, said in a statement: ''We
expect that a jury in Providence will find that Frank Corrente is a
good and honest man and will acquit him.''
</P>
<P>
   Cianci, 59, has been in office a total of 19 years. During his
first administration, in the 1980s, 30 city workers and contractors
were indicted on charges including extortion and fraud, and 22
eventually were convicted. Cianci denied knowing about the
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Cianci received a five-year suspended sentence for
assaulting a man he suspected of having an affair with his wife. He
was forced from office but was re-elected in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Corrente's indictment brings the investigation closer to the
mayor than many thought would happen, said City Council President
John Lombardi.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is in the mayor's office with this most recent
indictment,'' he said. ''Let the chips fall where they may.''

<HEADLINE> Pirates' Anderson Sent to Minors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh Pirates left-hander Jimmy Anderson,
who beat the Cubs on Wednesday for his first victory since April
15, was optioned Friday to Double-A Altoona.
</P>
<P>
   Taking Anderson's spot on the roster is outfielder Chad
Hermansen, who began the season as the starting center fielder but
was later demoted to Triple-A Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   The move is only temporary. The Pirates want to keep Anderson on
his regular throwing schedule during the All-Star break, especially
since right-hander Francisco Cordova will miss at least one start
with a sore elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Bronson Arroyo was optioned to Nashville last week
for the same reason. Anderson will return to the Pirates next
weekend in Cleveland and Arroyo may, too, especially if Cordova's
injury forces him to go on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson will start Monday for Altoona. He would have been sent
to Nashville, except the Sounds aren't scheduled that day.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very important that Jimmy be ready to pitch,'' general
manager Cam Bonifay said.
</P>
<P>
   Hermansen hit .243 with six home runs and 23 RBIs with
Nashville. With Adrian Brown (hamstring) likely to miss the entire
weekend series against Minnesota, the Pirates wanted another
outfielder on their roster.

<HEADLINE> GOP Helps Gore's Tenants Move Out  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN MILLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTHAGE, Tenn. (AP) -- The family renting a run-down home from
Vice President Al Gore is moving to Ohio -- with the help of the
Tennessee Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Seven GOP volunteers arrived Friday at the home 50 miles east of
Nashville to load two trucks with the household goods of Charles
and Tracy Mayberry and the six children who live at home. Two adult
sons and their families will continue to live in their Carthage
trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Mayberry called Gore a ''slumlord'' last month, saying she
wanted to get the vice president's attention for much-needed
repairs at the home, which is within view of the Gore family
farmhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the Democratic presidential contender, called and promised
to get repairs done, but she says she's tired of waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm tired with putting up with lies. I'm tired with putting up
with Al Gore,'' she said. ''He don't even need to be a mayor of a
small town. He ain't fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway said about $5,000 in repairs were
made, including a new kitchen floor, interior paint, gutters and
improved plumbing and wiring.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the work that she requested has been done, and then
some,'' Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayberry pointed to continuing problems, including a wet blue
towel wrapped around the base of a leaking toilet, urine-soaked
baseboards and an electrical outlet that shoots sparks when a TV is
plugged in.
</P>
<P>
   Gore planned to visit his mother Saturday in Carthage but had no
comment about the Mayberry move.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey and Charles Elrod, the Gore family friends who manage the
rental house, say the Mayberry family has not taken care of the
home and that the septic system was plugged with toys and debris.
</P>
<P>
   The family had been asked to leave the home by June 26, but Gore
reversed that decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, who alerted reporters to Friday's move, said
they were just there to help out.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the Volunteer State, and we do help our own,'' said
state Republican chairman Chip Saltsman, who was one of the group
wearing orange GOP shirts and moving furniture.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans will follow the Mayberry family to Lima, Ohio,
to help the family settle Saturday into a six-bedroom, $425-a-month
rental home near friends. The GOP is paying about $1,000 for the
two moving trucks, gas to Ohio and hotel rooms, Saltsman said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mayberry said the last straw was last week when her
14-year-old daughter was bitten by a spider and required medical
help.
</P>
<P>
   She's also weary of locals harassing her. She says her dog was
poisoned and her cat's throat was slit.
</P>
<P>
   But she got the parting shots.
</P>
<P>
   On the bathroom mirror, she left a bumper sticker that said
''Gore-Free Tennessee.''
</P>
<P>
   And shortly before the trucks drove away, she and her husband
posed for a photo on their front porch armed with two rifles. The
photo is for a movie their cousin is making about their saga.
</P>
<P>
   They joked that it showed them ''fightin' with the Gores.''

Clinton Puts Off Execution
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has postponed the first federal
execution since 1963 so the condemned inmate can seek clemency under guidelines
being updated by the government. Convicted killer Juan Raul Garza is one of 21
people, including Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, on the federal death
row. ''Given that nearly 40 years have passed since the last prisoner was in
this situation,'' the president ''wants new guidelines that reflect the

<HEADLINE> Gooden Returns to Shea as a Yankee  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD FENDRICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- For Dwight Gooden, it'll be just like old times
-- with a twist.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden gets another chance to straddle the mound at Shea
Stadium, where he won a Cy Young Award and a World Series ring with
the Mets, when he returns to the major leagues Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Only he'll be facing the Mets, pitching for the New York Yankees
in the opener of a day-night doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   For Mets outfielder Derek Bell, it'll be just like Little
League.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've known Doc since I was 9 years old. He'd watch us play and
tell you what you were doing wrong, tell you how to snap your
fingers for the curveball. He was like my older brother,'' Bell,
who grew up with Gooden in Tampa, Fla., said at Shea Stadium before
Friday night's opener of the Subway Series.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden was not at the ballpark for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''After our Little League games,'' said Bell, who asked -- and
received -- permission from Gooden to wear Doc's old No. 16 when the
outfielder joined the Mets from the Houston Astros for this season,
''we'd look through the fence and watch him play. He always
dominated. ...
</P>
<P>
   ''When I see him out there (Saturday), I'm just going to have to
realize I have a job to do. It's going to be emotional out there.''
</P>
<P>
   It probably will be for Gooden, who could be getting his last of
a string of chances in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   After 11 seasons with the Mets -- which saw him, at 20, become
the youngest Cy Young Award winner in 1985, and win a World Series
championship a year later -- Gooden missed the 1995 season because
of a drug suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ''He made sure his 'little brother' only followed in his
footsteps on the field,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   The man known as Dr. K for his ability strike out batters thanks
to a blazing fastball then joined the Yankees in 1996. In two
seasons with the club, Gooden went 20-12 with a 4.58 ERA and tossed
a no-hitter against Seattle on May 14, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But his stay ended after injuries and ineffectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden was 2-3 with a 6.86 ERA for Houston and Tampa Bay this
season, before being released by the Devil Rays in May. The Yankees
signed him to a minor league deal two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Now Gooden, 10 victories shy of 200 in the major, officially
rejoins the Yankees' roster Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're ever going to do it, what better time than here and
now, because of the scene,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm anxious to see Doc pitch,'' said Yankees right-hander
David Cone, a teammate of Gooden's with both New York clubs.
''It'll be one of those unique moments to see the crowd reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Mets manager Bobby Valentine, ''It's an event within an
event. It'll be interesting to see how it turns out. I remember the
vibrations felt in major league spring training and the impact he
made.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell remembers himself and Gooden having a hard time stifling
giggles when they faced off at this level in the past -- giddy at
the prospect of two childhood friends staring each other down in
the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ''We couldn't stop laughing at each other,'' Bell said. ''He had
to look the other way.
</P>
<P>
   ''For Mets fans to see him pitch here one more time is great.
The fans are still going to love him for being Doc and for what he
did here. He had a subway train behind his fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   With his 35-year-old right arm no longer able to generate that
kind of velocity, Gooden has added a split-fingered fastball to his
arsenal. In two minor league starts for the Yankees' Gulf Coast
League team in Florida, Gooden allowed four hits over eight shutout
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I faced him when he dominated this uniform and this stadium.
He might have some flashbacks to back when he was punching people
out with that fastball,'' said Mets outfielder Lenny Harris.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who knows? A lot of people are trying to close the book on
him. He's not ready to close it.''

<HEADLINE> Colombia Anti-Drug Donors Vow $621M  </HEADLINE>
By CIARAN GILES
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- International donors pledged $621 million
on Friday to help fund Colombia's multibillion-dollar project to
combat cocaine production and revitalize the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia is trying to gather $3.5 billion from foreign donors to
add to its own contribution of $4 billion to the project, which
includes plans to beef up military action against the drug trade,
protected by Colombia's powerful rebel movement.
</P>
<P>
   The pledges from the one-day conference, which gathered 27
nations and several international agencies in Madrid, ''forms the
first contribution from the international community to the peace
process'', said Enrique Iglesias, head of the Inter-American
Development Bank, which is presiding over the Colombia Plan.
</P>
<P>
   Spain offered $100 million, while Japan will donate $70 million
and Norway, $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations will provide $131 million, while the
Inter-American Development Bank and the Andean Corporation for
Development, will jointly contribute $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union said it would announce its contribution at
the next meeting of supporting nations, scheduled for September in
the Colombian capital, Bogota. Other countries said they would make
their donations over the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the U.S. delegation to the Madrid conference said
Washington is contributing $250 million to social development and
alternative crop development in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   That money comes from a $1.3 billion aid package already
approved by the U.S. Congress for the Colombia Plan, announced in
September by Colombian President Andres Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher welcomed Spain's
contribution to the anti-narcotics program, saying the
administration is ''especially grateful'' not only for the pledge
but also for Spain's role in hosting the conference.
</P>
<P>
   He praised other European countries for their positive responses
at the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''The conference has been a huge success,'' said Colombian
Foreign Minister Guillermo Fernandez de Soto. ''The presence of 26
countries and other institutions showed international solidarity
with our peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether most of the aid would go to bolstering the
Colombian military, he said at least half the funding was destined
to social and economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a plan for peace that looks to strengthen the state's
capability to combat narcotics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Ministry officials from the 15 European Union countries
as well nations such as Japan, Brazil and Canada attended the
meeting as did the Inter-American Development Bank, the
International Monetary Fund, the United Nations and the European
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombia Plan has raised fierce opposition from critics who
believe the aid, especially the U.S. package, will simply be used
to step up the war against Colombia's guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia is the world's biggest cocaine producer with thousands
of tons of the coca plant grown there each year. The crops are
protected by rebels and rival right-wing paramilitary groups who
benefit financially from the drug trade.

<HEADLINE> Williamson To Start for Reds  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Reliever Scott Williamson, the 1999 NL Rookie
of the Year, is making a big career change.
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Reds shook up their struggling rotation Friday by
moving Ron Villone to the bullpen and turned Williamson into a
starter.
</P>
<P>
   They also put starter Osvaldo Fernandez on the disabled list
with a sore elbow and recalled reliever Scott Winchester from
Triple-A Louisville. Reliever Elmer Dessens will move into the
rotation, taking Fernandez's spot.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds went into Friday night's game against Cleveland with a
41-43 mark, in large part because of their rotation, which doesn't
have a complete game and is averaging the fewest innings of any
staff in the NL.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson, 24, was a starter throughout his career until last
season, when he made the staff as a reliever and became a co-closer
with Danny Graves.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander has struggled this season, going 2-5 with a
3.65 ERA and six saves. He has walked 46 and thrown 13 wild
pitches, eclipsing his totals for last season in both categories.
</P>
<P>
   ''Williamson has been a starter before,'' manager Jack McKeon
said. ''This is what he really likes to do. So psychologically we
hope this can be a plus and get him back in the swing of things.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we use him a couple or three days in a row, he's stiff or
something is tight. I think he goes out trying to air out his 96-97
mph fastball and that's the result. This way he can start and have
four days of rest and he'll be better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds considered moving Williamson into the rotation during
spring training, when it became apparent they'd need help. They
resisted because he was so effective late in games.
</P>
<P>
   With Graves turning into a dependable closer and the rotation in
a shambles, they decided to give it a try.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson has said repeatedly that he doesn't care whether he
starts or relieves.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be exciting,'' he said Friday. ''When I go out
there, it's going to be natural for me. It's something I've done
all my life.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to running more to get in better shape, Williamson
is working on his changeup, a pitch he seldom used as a reliever.
He stuck to his fastball, split-finger fastball and slider late in
games.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a reliever, it's hard to come in in the eighth or ninth and
throw a changeup -- unless you're Trevor Hoffman,'' Williamson said.
</P>
<P>
   Villone was an important part of the Reds' 96-win season last
year. When Jason Bere and Steve Avery had problems in the first
half, Villone was moved into the rotation and went 8-7 in 22
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Villone is 7-6 with a 5.98 ERA in 17 starts this season.

<HEADLINE> State officials appeal to towns, cities for help with prison expansion </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Struggling to handle a rapidly growing
prison population, state officials are appealing to towns and
cities across the state to consider opening new prisons or expand
existing ones.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal comes as the state faces increasing scrutiny for its
most significant move to ease overcrowding - the transfer of nearly
500 inmates to a maximum-security Virginia prison. Two Connecticut
prisoners have died since being shipped to Wallens Ridge in Big
Stone Gap, Va., the most recent on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent Friday to every municipality in Connecticut,
Correction Commissioner John J. Armstrong emphasized the pressing
need for more prison space.
</P>
<P>
   ''The inmate population has grown dramatically in the last few
years and the long-term rate of growth shows no immediate sign of
slowing or reversal,'' Armstrong wrote. ''We ask that you give
serious consideration to submitting a proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   The state has more than 17,000 inmates in 20 prisons, a 22
percent increase from 5 years ago. The inmate population has nearly
doubled in the past decade due to tougher sentencing laws, and is
projected to grow to more than 21,000 prisoners in 2004, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   State officials face an uphill battle in trying to persuade
towns and cities to house a prison.
</P>
<P>
   Cheshire Mayor David Borowy said Friday he would oppose any
expansion to the prison in his town, which houses about 2,500
prisoners. The Cheshire Correctional Institution is near an
elementary school and convalescent home, he said, adding that the
town has had to cope with inmate escapes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're the home to more prisoners than any other town in the
state,'' Borowy said. ''I think we've more than done our share.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fairfield County town of Darien has no prison and is not
interested in opening one, said First Selectman Robert Harrel.
</P>
<P>
   ''The price of land in Darien is not conducive'' to a prison,
Harrel said. ''We're a community that is about 98 percent built
out. It's not something I'd welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Other moves to expand prison space have also met with
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to transfer inmates to Wallens Ridge last October
has sparked allegations of mistreatment and calls for the
prisoners' return in the wake of two deaths this year.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence James Frazier, 50, lapsed into a coma and died Tuesday
after being shocked repeatedly with a stun gun. In April,
20-year-old David Tracy, of Bridgeport, hung himself in his cell.
</P>
<P>
   While the contract with Virginia has been sharply criticized, a
plan to open a prison at the New Haven armory was squelched in the
Legislature. Local opposition to the project was stiff.
</P>
<P>
   One solution to Connecticut's overcrowded prisons may be to add
extra beds to the state's drug treatment and psychiatric units,
said State Rep. Michael Lawlor, D-East Haven. Lawlor, co-chair of
the Legislature's Judiciary committee, said towns and cities may be
interested in housing new prisons - especially low-security
dormitories for drunken drivers - because of the financial
incentives.
</P>
<P>
   If a town or city agrees to a new prison or an expansion, they
could be eligible for payments in lieu of taxes, jobs for local
residents and increased purchasing of goods and services locally.
</P>
<P>
   State officials also are promising local input in terms of the
size and security level of the prison population to be housed in a
municipality.
</P>
<P>
   An information session is scheduled for 10 a.m. July 26 at the
Maloney Center for Training and Staff Development in Cheshire.
Municipalities have until July 21 to send letters of interest and
until Sept. 1 to complete proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the families of the inmates who died at Wallens Ridge
plan a rally in Bridgeport Saturday to call for an end to the
transfers.

<HEADLINE> Dan Quayle's Father Dies at 79  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUN CITY WEST, Ariz. (AP) -- James C. Quayle, an Indiana
newspaper publisher and father of former Vice President Dan Quayle,
died Friday. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, who had been in failing health for several years, died
at a care center. He had most recently lived in Wickenburg, about
60 miles west of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle was chairman of Huntington Newspapers Inc. in Indiana. He
owned the Huntington Herald-Press with his wife, Corinne Pulliam
Quayle, since 1964.
</P>
<P>
   He was publisher of that newspaper from 1963 to 1990, except for
six years when he was publisher of The Muncie Star and Evening
Press beginning in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle's newspaper career began as an advertising salesman in
Lebanon, Ind., in 1945. He joined The Portsmouth Daily Times in
Ohio in 1947, also as an ad salesman. He moved to Huntington in
1948 as advertising manager.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle left Huntington in 1955 to go to Phoenix as public
relations and personnel director for The Arizona Republic and
Phoenix Gazette.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Huntington in 1963 as publisher and bought the
newspaper from Central Newspapers Inc. the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife and son, Quayle is survived by two other sons,
Christopher P. Quayle of Carefree, and Michael Quayle, publisher of
the Vincennes (Ind.) Sun-Commercial; and a daughter, Martha Quayle
Thomas of Monticello, Wis.

<HEADLINE> W.Va. Abortion Law Struck Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- West Virginia's law that restricts
certain late-term abortions is unconstitutional based on a recent
Supreme Court ruling that struck down a similar law in Nebraska, a
federal judge said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Joseph R. Goodwin issued a permanent
injunction that prohibits enforcement of West Virginia's law
banning what opponents call ''partial-birth'' abortion. Goodwin
earlier had stopped the law from going into effect pending the
court's ruling in the Nebraska case, which came June 29.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 West Virginia law said anyone who conducted the
procedure could be found guilty of a felony, imprisoned for two
years and fined up to $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin's order cited reasons similar to the Supreme Court's
arguments. The court said the Nebraska law was written too broadly
and could be interpreted to outlaw all abortions, placing an undue
burden on a woman seeking a legal abortion. It also did not include
an exception allowing the procedure to protect a woman's health.

<HEADLINE> Priest's status unclear after prison release  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GOSHEN, N.Y. (AP) - Victims of a priest who admitted sexually
abusing boys in his parish are angry the Archdiocese of New York
can't say for certain if he'll still be a priest when he leaves
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Edward A. Pipala has served seven years in a federal
penitentiary after pleading guilty to taking a minor across state
lines to New Jersey for illicit sex. Reports said he had sex with
as many as 50 boys. He is due to be released July 23 to an
undisclosed location in Yonkers, the Times Herald-Record of
Middletown reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Pipala was pastor at St. John the Evangelist Catholic Church
here and assistant pastor at Sacred Heart Catholic Church in
Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   Pipala will have to register as a sex offender with local police
but victims and their advocates are incensed the Archdiocese of New
York won't say if he is still a priest.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he still is a priest, he won't be assigned anywhere,''
archdiocese spokesman Joseph Zwilling told the newspaper Thursday.
He could not be reached for comment and did not return a page
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can there even be a question that he remains a priest?''
said one victim who was not identified. ''He should be in jail
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They've had this guy's paperwork for seven years and they
don't know his status?'' James O'Donnell, a former State Police
major and St. John's parishioner who investigated Pipala, told the
paper. ''He may have repaid his debt to society, but he can never
repay his debt to the victims.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a predator,'' said Orange County District Attorney
Francis D. Phillips, also a parishioner at St. John's. ''I'm not
that optimistic that his lengthy imprisonment has had any effect on
changing his behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of Pipala's victims filed more than $500 million in
lawsuits against the priest and the archdiocese. They received
payments estimated at a total of more than a million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   During the investigation, Pipala told police the archdiocese
knew of the allegations of pedophilia against him as early as 1977.
Still, he said, they sent him for treatment and then reassigned him
to at least two other parishes.

<HEADLINE> Grant Hill To Sign With Orlando  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- All-Star Grant Hill said Friday that
he will sign with the Orlando Magic.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is probably one of the hardest decisions I've had to
make,'' the former Detroit Pistons star told Detroit radio station
WDFN. ''In my heart, I wanted to stay, I really did, but I decided
this was the route that I wanted to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Magic offered the free agent $67.5 million for six years,
the most allowed under the collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was leaning there, and that's why I visited there, and
that's why I didn't visit anyplace else,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ultimately it's just a good fit, and it wasn't about going
down there and seeing Mickey Mouse. To me, I've always been
impressed with the team and that organization, and it's a place
where, if I was to leave Detroit, that's where I wanted to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision came amid a heightened courtship of Hill, in which
the New York Knicks flew their management team to Detroit to meet
with him and the Pistons urged him to re-sign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still heard out other teams, and I still heard what they had
to say,'' Hill said. ''But at the end of the day, this is the
decision I made and the decision I'm comfortable with.''
</P>
<P>
   Pistons executive Joe Dumars said he met with Hill on Thursday,
two days after the five-time All-Star returned from a house-hunting
trip to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a very good conversation,'' Dumars said. ''I wished him
well, and we both expressed some sorriness about the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill became a free agent last Saturday, but cannot sign a
contract until Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   He visited Orlando with San Antonio center-forward Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no guarantee first of all that Tim Duncan's going
there, and I understand that,'' Hill said. ''He's got a tough
decision to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill has spent his entire career with Detroit. He averaged 25.8
points last season, third-best in the NBA.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Cans Found at Davidian Compound  </HEADLINE>
By SHERRI CHUNN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas (AP) -- Four gas cans and a homemade torch were
recovered from what had been the dining room of the Branch Davidian
complex after fires consumed it in 1993, Texas Rangers testified
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Grubbs, one of the Rangers who helped gather evidence
including the fuel cans after the deadly fire, testified that Clive
Doyle, one of nine people who escaped, told him the blaze was
started with Coleman fuel that was distributed throughout the
compound.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he knew who started it, Doyle refused to answer
the question, Grubbs testified.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt he had information; he just wouldn't give it to us,''
Grubbs said.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 Branch Davidians and leader David Koresh died -- some
from fire, others from gunshots -- when their compound went up in
flames on April 19, 1993, at the end of their 51-day standoff with
federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   Fire investigators have said one of three blazes that day
started in the dining room area, and the government was using
Grubbs' testimony to support its contention that the Branch
Davidians were suicidal and started the fires themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Davidian survivors and relatives of those who were killed in the
standoff claim in their $675 million wrongful death lawsuit that
federal agents contributed to or caused at least some of the fires.
</P>
<P>
   A fire expert hired by the plaintiffs has testified that tanks
used in an FBI tear-gassing operation on the final day turned the
compound into kindling by punching holes in the walls, allowing
wind gusts to feed the flames.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs also say tanks could have contributed to or caused
the flames by knocking over lanterns used to illuminate the
compound during the standoff or by tumbling fuel cans used to fill
the lanterns. Grubbs said lantern parts were found near the cans.
</P>
<P>
   Grubbs said Rangers interviewed Doyle a day after the fire, as
he lay in a burn ward of a Dallas hospital. Doyle's mother, Edna
Doyle, who sat in the courtroom with her 59-year-old son, quietly
repeated the words ''You're a liar'' as Grubbs testified about the
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Doyle, a plaintiff in the lawsuit, testified last
week he could feel skin ''rolling off his hands'' as he jumped out
of the burning building through a hole made by government tanks.
</P>
<P>
   A government attorney presented Doyle with the melted remains of
a blue nylon jacket he wore on the final day of the standoff and
asked why the sleeves of the jacket were covered with ignitable
liquids.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could have come from constantly filling lanterns,'' Doyle
testified at the time. ''I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of lanterns were in use throughout the building after FBI
agents cut off the compound's electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Ranger Sgt. Lane Aiken also testified that while searching
the burned grounds of the compound the day after the siege ended, a
fellow Ranger found a damp torch in the mud near the rear of the
building.
</P>
<P>
   Lead plaintiffs' attorney Michael Caddell asked Aiken if he knew
it really was a torch.
</P>
<P>
   ''It certainly looks like a torch. I can't imagine it being used
for something else,'' he said. The torch later failed lab tests
that checked for flammable liquids.

<HEADLINE> 11 Arrested in $95M Investment Scam  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- Eleven people have been indicted for
allegedly running a scam that bilked $95 million from investors who
were promised their money would triple in a year.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment, announced Friday by U.S. Attorney P. Michael
Patterson, charged the defendants with running a pyramid scheme.
The money was laundered through corporations and banks for the
benefit of the defendants, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants live in Florida, Arizona, Tennessee, New York,
England and Canada. Eight of those indicted had been arrested as of
Friday, said Patterson's spokeswoman Gayle Kinsley.
</P>
<P>
   All 11 were charged with at least one count of conspiracy to
commit wire fraud and securities fraud and a second count of
conspiracy to launder money.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were told their money would buy U.S. Treasury
obligations that would in turn be leveraged in a secret trading
program with a return of 360 percent a year or more.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, each defendant faces a maximum prison sentence of
five years under the first count, 10 years for the second count and
up to 10 years for each money laundering count. Arraignment is set
for July 20.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Albert Belle made his mark on Yankee Stadium --
and now he'll have to pay for it.

   The New York Yankees have billed the Baltimore Orioles $300 for

   Belle's outburst came Wednesday night, shortly after he grounded
into a double play in the first inning of a 12-6 loss.

<HEADLINE> Gymnasts Prepare for Olympics  </HEADLINE>
By DANNY M. BOYD
<TEXT>
<P>
   TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- With the Sydney Olympics only two months
away, seven of the country's top gymnasts are beginning their
warm-up in the U.S. Classic this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But Shannon Miller, the most-decorated American gymnast ever,
won't be competing in Saturday's meet. Miller suffered a hairline
crack on her right tibia Thursday after an awkward landing off the
vault during training.
</P>
<P>
   Miller needs about 10 days of rest before she starts training
for the national championships, which begin July 26 in St. Louis,
said Steve Nunno, her longtime coach.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very minor injury,'' Nunno said. ''With Shannon's
determination, she will be fully ready by championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Dawes, another member of the Magnificent Seven,
withdrew to concentrate on training for the championships.
</P>
<P>
   While the U.S. Classic is a qualifier for nationals, Miller and
Dawes will still be able to compete at the national championships.
As former Olympians, they can petition for a spot at nationals,
said Kathy Kelly, senior director for the women's program for USA
Gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   The Classic will still feature three members of the Magnificent
Seven. Amy Chow, Dominique Moceanu and Jaycie Phelps will compete,
along with national team members Vanessa Atler, Kristen Maloney,
Jamie Dantzscher and Morgan White.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 39 gymnasts will compete in Tulsa, with the top 12
qualifying for nationals. Another qualifying meet was held earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their resumes, it's improbable that all five returning
members of the Magnificent Seven will make this year's squad, said
Bela Karolyi, the national team coordinator. That's because the
United States has developed other strong gymnasts the last four
years, like Elise Ray, the top U.S. finisher in the all-around at
last fall's world championships.
</P>
<P>
   Ray isn't competing this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to see 50-50: 50 percent former Olympians and 50
percent new members,'' Karolyi said. The Olympic team will consist
of six members and an alternate.
</P>
<P>
   Phelps, returning to competition after a three-year break, said
Friday she does not consider herself a shoo-in for the Olympic
team.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of new kids out there and there's a lot of new
competition, and I'm ready,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Annabeth Eberle, one of 20 members of the national team,
qualified for the championships at a meet in Reno, Nev., in
February but chose to compete in Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   Eberle said she feels good about her chances going into the
championships and tries not to think about some of her competitors
being former Olympians.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they are (like) other gymnasts out there competing,''
she said.

<HEADLINE> Henninger Leads Western Open  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEMONT, Ill. (AP) -- Brian Henninger knows he's not like Tiger
Woods. He doesn't have the booming drives or those awe-inspiring
shots that can humble everyone else on the course.
</P>
<P>
   But when he's relaxed, look out, because he can swing with the
best of them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't blow the course away. I can't hit it far enough to
bring it to its knees. I have to do everything right, like I did
today,'' he said after tying the Western Open record with a
9-under-par 63 and taking a one-stroke lead with an 11-under 133.
</P>
<P>
   Henninger was the third player to tie the record in the first
two rounds of this year's Western Open, sponsored by Advil. Stephen
Ames did it earlier Friday, and Nick Price did it Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Langham, who took a month off after tying for second in
the Kemper Open, was one stroke behind Henninger after shooting a
65. Ames, Price, Fred Couples, Stuart Appleby and Steve Flesch were
two strokes back at 9-under 135.
</P>
<P>
   ''I needed a break,'' Langham said of his layoff. ''I played six
weeks in a row up until then and I kind of ran out of gas. I feel
really good. I feel fresh and ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods said the same thing after taking two weeks off after his
amazing, 15-stroke victory in the U.S. Open, but he continued to
struggle with his putter. After missing more makable putts in one
day than he did the entire week at Pebble Beach, he's six strokes
back at 139 after rounds of 70 and 69.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just need to go out there and play a good solid weekend,''
Woods said before heading to the putting green. ''Hopefully I can
get myself back in this tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   With the cut at 1-under 143, among those sent home for the
weekend were Phil Mickelson (144), Masters champion Vijay Singh
(145) and Casey Martin (149).
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long ago that Henninger was hoping just to make the
cut. He missed four straight early in the season, and then missed
another four heading into the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after shooting a 77 in the opening round at Pebble
Beach, he decided he needed to make a change.
</P>
<P>
   ''Missing cuts by a shot every week was telling me something was
wrong,'' he said. ''It was all stress-related.''
</P>
<P>
   So Henninger sat down with Dr. Richard Coop, a sports
psychologist. They decided Henninger was just too tense, so worried
about hitting the ball he was holding his clubs in a death grip.
Relax, Coop said.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly an easy prescription, but Henninger tried it. He
still missed the cut in the U.S. Open, but he shot a 73. He played
better last weekend, tying for 48th in the Greater Hartford Open.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, this week, everything clicked.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yesterday, I really hit the ball well,'' he said. ''I knew if
I could get the putts to drop, and they started to drop today.''
</P>
<P>
   He hit 15 of 18 greens Friday, and made a couple of putts from
20-plus feet. But with so many players hovering at 9 under,
Henninger knew he needed something special to take the lead.
</P>
<P>
   So with 211 yards to go on the par-5 15th, he pulled out his
3-iron.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot hit a 3-iron usually that far,'' he said, smiling at
the memory. ''And I jacked this one big-time up in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   The ball landed about 6 feet from the pin and Henninger holed it
for an eagle to reach 10 under.
</P>
<P>
   He picked up another stroke and tied the course record with a
birdie on the par-4 16th. He knew he could get the record all to
himself with another birdie, but his 5-foot putt lipped out on 17
and his 25-foot putt rolled around the edge of the cup on 18.
</P>
<P>
   No big deal, Henninger said. Stay relaxed, remember?
</P>
<P>
   ''There's so much golf to go,'' he said. ''If I continue to hit
it good, I think I'll do pretty good. But there are some
world-class golfers out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Woods, for one.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's just incredible,'' Henninger said. ''He can throw a round
in like I did the next two days, and he's right there and he's
scaring the pants off everybody like he usually does.''
</P>
<P>
Divots: Starting off the back nine, Price's round fell apart on
the 16th with two straight bogeys. He missed a 3-foot par putt on
16 and a 10-footer stopped about a half-inch from the hole on 17.
... Attendance on Friday was 42,336 -- more than 4,000 people more
than last year. The number is even more impressive because the
Crosstown Series between the White Sox and Cubs began Friday
afternoon at Wrigley Field. ... The three 63s so far this year is a
record of its own. Only three players -- Jeff Sluman, John Adams and
Dudley Hart -- had shot 63 since the tournament moved to Cog Hill in
1991, and they did it in different years.

<HEADLINE> Russian: Chechens Plan New Attacks  </HEADLINE>
By RUSLAN MUSAYEV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Russia's defense minister conceded Friday
that the 10-month-old military offensive against rebels in Chechnya
could drag on through the winter and said the Chechens are planning
new coordinated attacks.
</P>
<P>
   While the military has been claiming for months that victory was
just days away, Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev's prognosis was much
more sober. The military has been smarting since a succession of
suicide truck bombings Sunday killed at least 33 soldiers, proof
the rebels remain tenacious and organized.
</P>
<P>
   ''The autumn-winter period will be a good time to complete the
operation in Chechnya,'' Sergeyev told members of Russia's upper
house of parliament who questioned him about the war Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite elimination of large rebel formations, the federal
forces have not yet established full and continuous control over
the entire territory of Chechnya,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Defense Ministry intelligence, he said rebels were
planning large-scale attacks in areas ostensibly under Russian
control, including parts of the capital Grozny and the Caucasus
foothills.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bandits consider it efficient to carry out a new series of
terrorist acts, using vehicles full of explosives,'' he said, in
remarks carried on Russian television.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev also claimed that the rebels had reshuffled their
command, appointing warlord Shamil Basayev as commander in chief in
place of Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov. A Maskhadov spokesman
reached by telephone denied any such change.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Mumadi Saidayev said a council of 20 guerrilla
commanders met overnight and decided to step up attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev also said the rebels were planning to assassinate the
head of Chechnya's pro-Moscow civilian administration, Muslim
leader Akhmad Kadyrov.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a rebel spokesman also said new offensives were on
the way.
</P>
<P>
   A council of 20 guerrilla commanders met overnight and decided
to step up attacks, Mumadi Saidayev, spokesman for Chechen
President Aslan Maskhadov, told The Associated Press by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ''Taking into account the favorable factors in the current
situation, the defense council decided to take measures on starting
large-scale military operations,'' Saidayev said.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov was elected president in 1997 but has little control
over several guerrilla leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces withdrew from Chechnya in humiliation after a
1994-96 war, and launched another military operation last September
to try to re-establish Moscow's control over the rebellious region.
The campaign came after Chechen-based rebels invaded neighboring
republic of Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   The streets of Chechnya's second largest city, Gudermes, were
quiet Friday as residents stayed inside amid speculation of an
impending rebel attack, Russia's ORT television reported.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo said Friday that Russian
investigators have detained two Chechens accused of loading
explosives into a truck used in one of Sunday's suicide bombings.
The two men reportedly confessed to preparing the attack in Argun,
where at least 26 servicemen died.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Interior Minister Vladimir Kozlov said altogether 80
people had been detained in connection with the bombings, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have blamed poor discipline among troops for
the attackers' ability to get past checkpoints and drive up to
Russian positions. Reporters have observed widespread bribe-taking
by troops guarding checkpoints.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton says she's still ''a baby campaigner''  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) - Celebrating her one year anniversary as a
political candidate, Hillary Rodham Clinton said Friday that she
still can't compete with her husband's campaign skills.
</P>
<P>
   She also launched yet another harsh attack on her Republican
rival for the U.S. Senate, Rep. Rick Lazio, accusing him of
engaging in ''typical political double talk, double speak'' and
saying she found it ''frankly disturbing'' that he has still not
released his income tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to a comparison between her and President Clinton
on the stump, the first lady said it was no contest.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a baby campaigner. I'm still in the toddler stage,'' she
told reporters traveling with her on a five-day trip across upstate
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady said her husband is the best campaigner she has
ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nobody that I know with those sets of skills and
capacity to relate to people in every different kind of setting,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on her one-year anniversary on the campaign trail,
Clinton said, ''I had to learn to be a candidate. Those of you who
were with me early on, I hope have seen a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton kicked off her Senate campaign exactly one year
ago Friday with a visit to the upstate farm of Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, the Democrat she hopes to replace in the Senate. Moynihan
is retiring at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took a page out of the Lazio campaign playbook Friday
when she climbed aboard a bus in Ithaca carrying the press corps
following her campaign. On Wednesday, Lazio held a more than
20-minute news conference aboard a bus carrying reporters covering
his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why she was now taking to the reporters' bus, Clinton said
''maybe I hadn't been invited before.'' Actually, her own aides
arranged the appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Describing her year on the campaign trail, Clinton said ''mostly
it's been a great experience for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was greeted by hundreds of supporters as she walked the
streets of Ithaca, and by a few who didn't support her candidacy.
Working a rope line to shake supporters' hands, the first lady came
across one man holding a sign that said: ''New Yorkers for Rick
Lazio. Carpetbaggers go home.'' The first lady spoke briefly to the
man.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thanked him for coming out to see me,'' she said. ''I'm glad
to see him. It shows he's interested in the political process.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what the man said to her, Clinton said ''he just muttered.
I've noticed that people who hold signs like that mutter a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The man holding the sign refused to give his name but verified
that the first lady thanked him for showing up.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the signs were even less welcoming. One protester held
aloft a sign reading: ''I wonder who he's raping now?'' Underneath
was the name Juanita Broaddrick, an Arkansas woman who accused Bill
Clinton of sexually assaulting her at a Little Rock hotel in 1978.
He was the state's attorney general at the time. The president has
denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just part of the background music of my life,'' the first
lady said when asked about such signs.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters after a speech to more than 250 people at
a park in Elmira, Clinton continued her two-day old assault on
Lazio for sending out fund-raising letters that told potential
donors that ''Hillary Clinton and her husband have embarrassed our
country and disgraced their powerful posts.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has said he didn't write the letter or really read it even
though it went out over his signature and his campaign has said
they sent it out.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have been following this dog-ate-my-homework kind of
response,'' Clinton said. ''He didn't write the letter. He didn't
read the letter.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got to take responsibility for his record and for his
campaign,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on Albany's WROW-AM radio Friday, Lazio said, ''I
stand behind that letter. I accept responsibility for everything
that comes out of this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has been under pressure to release his tax returns ever
since it came out that he had made a hefty profit trading in stock
options of a company that was owned by some of his major campaign
contributors. Campaign aides to the Long Island congressman have
said the income tax returns will be made public sometime this
summer. The Clintons annually make public their tax returns.

<HEADLINE> 12 Wounded in Haiti Vote Violence  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Supporters of a losing mayoral
candidate went on a rampage in a remote in Haiti town, injuring 12
people and setting houses ablaze, a radio report said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second eruption of violence in a week over Haiti's
disputed elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of American States said in a statement Friday
it will not send observers to the second round of elections Sunday
because it disputes the formula used to determine winners in the
first-round voting in May and it ''cannot consider (the results)
either accurate or fair.''
</P>
<P>
   In the violence Thursday in Anse-d'Hainault, a coastal town of
29,000 on the tip of Haiti's southern peninsula, backers of losing
mayor Georges Simon ransacked Radio Rebelle, a community radio
station, and the home of its owner, Orelien Joachim, Radio Vision
2000 reported.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds also set fire to the house of Mayor-elect Necuel
Belcombe and wounded 12 people, who were hospitalized. In all six
houses were set ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   Belcombe ran under the banner of the five-party opposition
coalition known as Space for Concord in the June 11 election, the
radio said.
</P>
<P>
   Simon, the runner-up and outgoing mayor, was from the
left-leaning Effort at Solidarity to Build a National Popular
Alternative, which was allied with former President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide's party.
</P>
<P>
   ''Simon's victory had already been proclaimed when Wednesday, on
the basis of falsified tally sheets, the district election bureau
declared he had lost,'' party leader Kely Bastien told The
Associated Press in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is what provoked the rage of his supporters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, partisans of an independent mayoral candidate clashed
with supporters of the winning candidate from Aristide's Lavalas
Family party on Ile-a-Vache, an island of 12,000 people off Haiti's
southern coast.
</P>
<P>
   Two Aristide party members were killed and three houses were
burned down.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti has nine electoral districts. Eight of them held their
local and legislative elections on May 21, and the district of
Grand'-Anse, which includes the town of Anse-d'Hainault, held its
elections June 11.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties charge that the counting in the parliament
and local elections was skewed to ensure a massive victory for
Aristide, who is favored to win the November presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   The international community, including the United Nations and
the United States, have backed allegations that the counting was
irregular.
</P>
<P>
   A second round of balloting is set for Sunday despite a boycott
by almost all opposition parties and protests by the international
community.
</P>
<P>
   Official results from the first round show Lavalas winning 18 of
l9 contested seats in the 27-seat Senate and 29 seats in the
83-member House of Deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Since Aristide's party is leading in most of the 54 races to be
held Sunday, it is expected to win control of both houses of
Parliament.

<HEADLINE> Boy accidentally shoots 12-year-old sister in leg  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALTONA, N.Y. (AP) A 12-year-old girl was injured when her
brother accidentally shot her in the leg with a .44-caliber black
powder pistol.
</P>
<P>
   Raelyn Ostrander was shot in the thigh Thursday morning as her
13-year-old brother handled the pistol in their home. The bullet
passed through her leg and out a window.
</P>
<P>
   She was treated and released from a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting comes at a time of increased national attention on
gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Federal statistics show guns are in about half of all U.S.
households. According to the Center for Disease Control and
Prevention, five children died every day in firearm-related
accidents and suicides from 1990 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The state Legislature this year passed tougher gun regulations
including requiring trigger locks on new guns sold and raising the
age of legal ownership from 18 to 21.
</P>
<P>
   Also, more than 100 cities around the nation have handed out
free locks to help reduce the chance of an accidental discharge.
</P>
<P>
   Altona is in Clinton County, 154 miles north of Albany and 10
miles south of the Canadian border.

<HEADLINE> Lazio wraps up five-day campaign swing across New York  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Republican Senate candidate Rick Lazio ended his
week's tour around New York state Friday with visits to a dairy
farm near the Canadian border, a manufacturing plant outside
Rochester and a hospital in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being dogged by reporters' questions for three days
about a fund-raising letter signed by Lazio that claimed Hillary
Rodham Clinton and her husband had ''embarrassed the country and
disgraced their powerful posts'', the Long Island congressman said
he was pleased with the tour.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it was a great success in terms of connecting with
people,'' he said. ''We got a chance to talk about some of the
issues that I've been working on in Washington - housing, in
particular senior housing, veterans issues, issues involving the
agricultural economy here in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the trip, which included stops in Yonkers,
Schenectady, Saratoga Springs, Lake Placid, Watertown, Syracuse,
Buffalo and Rochester, Lazio tried to focus on his legislative
record as an eight-term congressman.
</P>
<P>
   His attempts to dictate the debate on issues derailed somewhat
on Wednesday, however, when the four-page fund-raising letter came
to light. He maintained that there was a difference between what a
candidate says in a letter to potential donors and what he says on
the stump.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked again Friday about the scathing wording of the
letter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the letter speaks for itself in terms of some of the
things that have gone on,'' he said at Bronx Lebanon Hospital,
where he was greeted by a small band of protesters shouting:
''You're in the wrong neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time all week that Lazio had been jeered so
lustily.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a great, great week because people have been so
supportive and so kind,'' he said at an appearance with farmers in
Wheatfield, near Niagara Falls. ''They made me feel at home. I feel
like this whole state is my home county now.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, who was a little-known congressman until New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani dropped out of the Senate and essentially ceded
the Republican nomination to Lazio, also said he was happy with the
level of name recognition he found on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no doubt that we've had, you know, exponential growth
in name ID, name identification, both in the amount of people that
connect with me, support me, know what I stand for,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Iverson Wants To Remain a 76er  </HEADLINE>
By SONJA BARISIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMPTON, Va. (AP) -- Allen Iverson said Friday he wants to remain
with the Philadelphia 76ers, but that his contentious relationship
with coach Larry Brown will make it difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be hard. It will be extremely hard,'' Iverson said
during a brief session with reporters before a reception for the
Allen Iverson Celebrity Summer Classic charity event.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be crazy for me to say that everything is peaches and
cream, because it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown benched Iverson for the final 20 minutes of a loss at
Detroit last December, and Iverson then said he should be traded if
Brown was unhappy with his play.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Iverson was suspended for a game in Miami after
missing a shootaround because of a headache. The high-scoring
guard, who frequently has been late to practice, reportedly was
fined nearly 75 times for showing up late last season alone.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson's comments about Brown came on the same day 76ers
president Pat Croce gave North Carolina permission to speak with
the well-traveled coach about its vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson, who initially said during a news conference to promote
the charity event that he hopes Brown does ''whatever it takes to
make him happy,'' met with reporters again later and said he and
Brown don't have to be friends to work well together.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I have to play under coach Brown, I have no problem,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson also said speculation that he might be traded because of
his frequent clashes with Brown has been keeping him away from
Philadelphia, and that he was annoyed that no one from the team
contacted him to tell him his status with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ''They owed me that,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> URGENT  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Patting down suspects is all part of a
cop's job, so Gov. Christie Whitman said Friday she didn't think
twice before putting her hands on an unarmed Camden man and going
through the motions of a police search.
</P>
<P>
   But Whitman acknowledged that a photograph of the search four
years ago likely will inflame allegations that state officials were
insensitive to charges of racial profiling. And the governor said
she fears a public outcry over the photograph will overshadow her
efforts to improve Camden, the state's poorest city.
</P>
<P>
   ''That worries me and for that I am deeply sorry,'' Whitman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't help anybody,'' Whitman said of the photograph,
taken by a law enforcement officer and not previously published.
''It's not something you care to see.''
</P>
<P>
   During an interview with The Associated Press, Whitman
repeatedly defended her search of the unidentified man, saying she
felt a duty to experience exactly the work of police officers who
patrol Camden streets.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to go in and see and experience what I was asking
them to do,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This wasn't a photo opportunity. I wanted to experience
things. I did everything they did that night.''
</P>
<P>
   In a copy of the photograph obtained by AP, Whitman is seen
standing behind what appears to be a black male. His hands are
spread out, palms are pressed against a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman is wearing a white sweatshirt, jeans, sneakers and a
baseball cap. Black gloves cover her hands, both of which look to
be pressed against the man's torso.
</P>
<P>
   In the photograph, Whitman appears to be smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman steadfastly rejected any claim that the picture portrays
her or the State Police as biased.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was what it was. It had absolutely nothing to do with
racial profiling,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's absolutely nothing to do with that. He's not a black
suspect. Not a white suspect. It was a suspect. That night there,
it was about crime. It was about drugs,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor now says she would not search suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am definitely not going to do it again,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman joined Camden City police and state troopers for two
nights in early 1996, just after the governor ordered troopers
there to bolster the ranks of local police. Both sessions were not
open to the media, Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   During her shifts with the police, Whitman said she went on
several raids, visited crack houses and open air drug markets. Her
time there illustrated the needs for both Camden's residents and
police, Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   The man she searched was ''stopped for suspicious activity'' by
the officers and then offered to the governor, Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   He was searched at least once by police officers before he was
presented to the governor so she could search him herself, Whitman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They asked me if I wanted to do this and I said yes,'' Whitman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They made sure he didn't have any weapons,'' she said. ''It
was really just to see what was involved in that kind of a
search.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said she had no idea if she had any legal authority to
conduct a search and she did not ask the officers present if she
was allowed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ''It never occurred to me to ask that question,'' she said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The man never spoke during his brief encounter with the
governor, Whitman said. He never gave Whitman any indication he
knew it was the state's highest elected official who was searching
him.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also said she was unsure if it was legal to hold a
man, search him twice and then let him go.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know that there's anything wrong with that,'' Whitman
said.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a problem with the fact that Whitman searched a man
who was apparently never charged by police, said the Rev. Reginald
Jackson, executive director of the Black Ministers Council of New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not think there is any reasonable explanation as to why
the chief executive officer of the state would find it acceptable
for a photo opportunity to search a young man,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   The photo was turned over to the Attorney General's Office.
Copies of the photograph have been subpoenaed by the lawyer
representing about 30 minority troopers.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the lawsuits by minority troopers, Vincent Bellaran,
Emblez Longoria, Glynn Moore and Marc Stephens said they had been
victims of racial discrimination within the State Police and that
they had seen minority motorists poorly treated by white troopers.
</P>
<P>
   They filed their claim last year after the Attorney General's
Office acknowledged the existence of racial profiling, a practice
in which white troopers pulled over minority drivers based on their
race.
</P>
<P>
   Those same internal investigations said the State Police did not
respond to complaints filed against troopers and that the
department did not hire enough women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The reports were sparked by the April 1998 shooting by white
troopers of four minority men during a traffic stop on the New
Jersey Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   Since the reports were issued, Whitman has appointed a new State
Police superintendent who has begun reforms in hiring and
promotions practices.
</P>
<P>
   Former state police chief Carl Williams adamantly opposed
Whitman's tour of Camden, but was overruled, according to his
lawyer. Williams said it was a ''bad idea for civilians to be
running around pretending to be cops,'' lawyer Clifford Van Syoc
said in May.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman fired Williams in February 1999 after he made public
statements linking minorities to drug suspects.

<HEADLINE> Ore. Logging Protesters Dispersed  </HEADLINE>
By TARA BURGHART
<TEXT>
<P>
   ESTACADA, Ore. (AP) -- The Forest Service drove anti-logging
protesters from trees and roadblocks in the Mount Hood National
Forest on Friday, breaking up a four-year effort to block the
harvest of a timber sale.
</P>
<P>
   Three women and a 17-year-old girl were cited with failure to
obey a Forest Service closure order, a federal misdemeanor. At
least six hours after being ordered to leave, the activists had
stayed in cargo nets and makeshift tree platforms rigged to block
access to the timber stand, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Forest supervisor Gary Larsen said a dozen protesters complied
immediately when federal officers ordered them out about 4:30 a.m.
Two women left or were removed about six hours later and one about
1 p.m. The girl, who had rigged a noose that was attached to
supports for her cargo net, left about 2:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Some activists alleged that federal officials endangered their
lives in the way they conducted the raid.
</P>
<P>
   But Larsen said, ''I'm confident every last one of our law
enforcement officials performed in a highly respectable manner.''
</P>
<P>
   The activists argue the logging threatens Portland's water
supply, could harm rare plants and animals, and will destroy
centuries-old trees. The Forest Service counters that the harvest
complies with environmental and water standards and the stand would
benefit from thinning.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have tried to stop the harvest ever since the
timber was sold in 1996. The on-site protest started last summer
with activists living in trees and camping in the area. In May,
they began to rig the cargo nets and tree platforms over the road
and suspend themselves inside.

<HEADLINE> States Blasted on Unsafe Truckers  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Many states are allowing unsafe truckers to
continue to drive, according to a Transportation Department report.
</P>
<P>
   The audit found that six of nine states visited by the
department failed to suspend the licenses of drivers who were
convicted of major infractions in another state, such as
drunken-driving or leaving the scene of an accident.
</P>
<P>
   A 1986 law requires that persons holding a commercial driver's
license must allow their driving record to be exchanged among
states so that the driver is held accountable for an infraction in
any state.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department visited 9 states and the District
of Columbia, and requested data from 41 states. They found that
seven of nine states visited and the District of Columbia, as well
as 15 states responding to the request, allowed commercial drivers
to avoid disqualification through special permits or probationary
licenses.
</P>
<P>
   A truck driver involved in the March 1999 train crash in
Bourbonnais, Ill., that killed 11 people was operating under a
probationary license.
</P>
<P>
   The report also shows how the communications system between
states is not being used properly.
</P>
<P>
   In a sample, 17 percent of convictions were not transmitted to
other states within 90 days. Also, some states recorded violations
from other states, but did not use them to trigger a
disqualification.
</P>
<P>
   A driver in Maryland was convicted in another state of driving a
commercial vehicle under the influence of drugs, which should have
carried a minimum 1-year loss of license for a first offense.
Though Maryland's records did show the offense, the driver retained
his license.
</P>
<P>
   There are seven violations that can cause a driver to have his
license immediately suspended even on a first offense, including
drunken-driving, violating railroad crossing rules and using a
commercial vehicle to distribute drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Several other common moving violations, such as speeding or
reckless driving, can mean a 60-day suspension for a second
offense.
</P>
<P>
   The report was requested by the House Transportation Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The six states visited that did not suspend the licenses of
commercial drivers who were convicted of an infraction in another
state were Maryland, Ohio, Texas, Florida, New York and Tennessee.]
</P>
<P>
   The 22 jurisdictions allow drivers to avoid suspension by
offering special licenses or probationary permits are: Arkansas,
Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,
Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Oregon,
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas,
Wisconsin, Wyoming, and the District of Columbia

<HEADLINE> Typhoon Plows Into Japan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A typhoon that killed 12 people in the Philippines
plowed into Japan Saturday, sending earth loosened by a powerful
earthquake crashing down from cliffs to bury buildings and roads.
</P>
<P>
   The storm lashed the Izu island chain south of Tokyo early
Saturday before heading northeast to skirt the Pacific coast of
Japan's main island of Honshu.
</P>
<P>
   The festival hall of a shrine and three homes were demolished by
landslides overnight on Kozushima, where 788 residents had been
evacuated to a high school on higher ground, said local official
Chizuru Ishida.
</P>
<P>
   There were no injuries. But damage to buildings and roads was
extensive on the island in the Izu chain that was rocked by a
magnitude 6 tremor on July 1 that killed one person, Ishida said.
</P>
<P>
   As skies cleared, officials prepared to lift the typhoon
evacuation order for residents on the island, about 90 miles south
of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people were evacuated from their homes two weeks ago
when a volcano rumbled to life on Miyakejima Island near Kozushima,
setting off hundreds of earthquakes and tremors in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Typhoon Kirogi was located in the Pacific Ocean 70 miles east of
Mito, a city about 60 miles northeast of Tokyo, as of Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The storm, packing winds of 55 mph, was not expected to come
ashore. But it was close enough to send huge waves crashing against
docks and dump heavy rains over Honshu.
</P>
<P>
   News reports said Kirogi caused power outages in several parts
of central Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile a tropical storm in the South China Sea was upgraded
to a typhoon and headed for mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   In the Philippines, floods and rain from typhoons bracketing the
region drove 400,000 people from their homes, officials said
Friday. At least 16 people were dead and 10 missing.
</P>
<P>
   Kirogi caused no problems in Okinawa, southern Japan, when it
passed by hundreds of miles out to sea Thursday. But concerns
remain that the typhoon season could produce a strong storm during
a July 21-23 summit of leaders of the Group of Eight industrialized
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Typhoon Kai-tak was about 375 miles east-southeast of Hong Kong
at 9 p.m. and expected to remain nearly stationary overnight, the
Hong Kong Observatory said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Sharon Manning scored 13 points and Marlies Askamp
had eight rebounds as the Miami Sol beat the Cleveland Rockers
49-46 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Sol held off a late charge by the Rockers when Askamp's
basket with 2:57 remaining gave Miami a 44-43 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Katrina Colleton and Kristen Rasmussen both made two free to
extend the lead to 48-43 with 25 seconds left in the game.
Cleveland's Merlakia Jones hit a 3-pointer with 15.6 seconds left
to close the gap to 48-46.
</P>
<P>
   Milena Flores' free throw with 12 seconds remaining closed out
the scoring, as Miami (6-11) won at home for the first time since
beating Cleveland on June 17.
</P>
<P>
   Askamp and Colleton added nine points each for the Sol.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockers (8-8) struggled without starting forward Eva
Nemcova, out for the season after tearing her anterior cruciate
ligament at Los Angeles last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Mery Andrade led Cleveland with 10 points, and Chastity Melvin
and Jones added nine each.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockers led 27-22 with 4:05 left in the first half, but the
Sol went on a 9-0 run to take a four-point lead at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockers jumped out to a 7-0 lead to start the game, but the
Sol took its first lead five minutes into the half after Askamp
tied the game with a lay-up and sank a subsequent foul shot that
made the score 10-9.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   GOSHEN, N.Y. (AP) - The Roman Catholic Church has already begun
proceedings to defrock a priest convicted of sexually abusing boys,
a spokesman for the archdiocese said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Edward A. Pipala has served seven years in a federal
penitentiary after pleading guilty to a federal charge of taking a
minor across state lines to New Jersey for illicit sex. Reports
said he had sex with as many as 50 boys and local charges were
filed as well.
</P>
<P>
   He is due to be released July 23 to an undisclosed location in
Yonkers, the Times Herald-Record of Middletown reported Friday.
Pipala will have to register as a sex offender with local police.
</P>
<P>
   Pipala was pastor at St. John the Evangelist Catholic Church
here and assistant pastor at Sacred Heart Catholic Church in
Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the two-million member Archdiocese of New York
said late Friday that the church in Rome has begun the process of
laicization, in which a priest is officially returned to lay
status, no longer allowed to perform the duties of a clergyman.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is still a priest (as of Friday) but the process began a
couple of years ago in Rome,'' said Joseph Zwilling, archdiocese
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier published reports indicated the archdiocese didn't know
what would become of Pipala, leading victims and their advocates to
rail against the church.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can there even be a question that he remains a priest?''
said one victim who was not identified. ''He should be in jail
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They've had this guy's paperwork for seven years and they
don't know his status?'' James O'Donnell, a former State Police
major and St. John's parishioner who investigated Pipala, told the
paper. ''He may have repaid his debt to society, but he can never
repay his debt to the victims.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a predator,'' said Orange County District Attorney
Francis D. Phillips, also a parishioner at St. John's. ''I'm not
that optimistic that his lengthy imprisonment has had any effect on
changing his behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of Pipala's victims filed more than $500 million in
lawsuits against the priest and the archdiocese. They received
payments estimated at a total of more than a million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   During the investigation, Pipala told police the archdiocese
knew of the allegations of pedophilia against him as early as 1977.
Still, he said, they sent him for treatment and then reassigned him
to at least two other parishes.

<HEADLINE> Doherty To Talk to North Carolina  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Notre Dame basketball coach Matt Doherty
has received permission to talk to North Carolina officials about
the school's coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty, a former North Carolina player, was headed to North
Carolina on Friday after a visit to the Nike basketball camp in
Indianapolis, WSBT-TV reported.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia 76ers coach Larry Brown, another former North
Carolina player, also has been granted permission to speak to North
Carolina about the job. On Thursday, Kansas coach Roy Williams
turned down an offer to coach the Tar Heels.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty, 38, has four years remaining on his five-year contract.
In his first season at Notre Dame, he led the Irish to a 22-15
record -- their best record in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty was not speaking to the news media, a representative of
the Notre Dame basketball office told WSBT.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Guthridge retired as North Carolina's coach last week.

<HEADLINE> Episcopalians OK Lutheran Alliance  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH KOHLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The nation's Episcopal bishops approved an
alliance with the country's largest Lutheran denomination Friday
under which the two faiths would share clergy and recognize each
other's sacraments.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance still needs approval from the other chamber of the
Episcopal Church's bicameral Legislature, the House of Deputies,
which includes lay people and clergy. The deputies took no action
Friday but the plan was on Saturday's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The church's 300-member House of Bishops, meeting at the
Episcopal General Convention, gave overwhelming approval to the
plan for ''full communion'' with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in
America.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a big moment in terms of official church cooperation,''
said the Rev. Lowell Almen, secretary of the Evangelical Lutheran
Church of America.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Lauren Stanley, an Episcopal priest from Arlington,
Va., who has preached to Lutheran congregations, said: ''What it
finally recognized is that we are one in the body of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   The two churches, with a combined 7.5 million members, have
discussed an alliance for three decades. The 2.4 million-member
Episcopal Church approved a similar plan in 1997, and Lutherans
endorsed one last year.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal approved Friday includes a compromise involving the
Episcopal ordination of bishops.
</P>
<P>
   Episcopal bishops are installed by a laying-on of hands by three
predecessor bishops from a line believed to extend back to Christ's
apostles.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance proposal would allow Lutheran clergy to serve in an
Episcopal church without going through an Episcopal ordination.
</P>
<P>
   New Lutheran bishops, though, would have to be ordained the
traditional Episcopal way if they want to preach in an Episcopal
church.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, the convention's Committee on Church and Human
Sexuality discussed resolutions on the issue of blessing homosexual
relationships. One proposal would allow rites for heterosexual or
homosexual couples who live in monogamous, committed relationships.
Another would codify the church's unofficial policy of allowing
each diocese to decide whether to ordain homosexuals and bless gay
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   No action on the issue is expected until next week.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Fire Suspect Won't Be Charged  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) -- A man suspected of starting a
campfire that grew to engulf 10,600 acres near Rocky Mountain
National Park will not be charged due to a lack of evidence,
authorities said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The campfire, started June 12, destroyed 22 structures. At the
time, campfires were banned because of dry conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities sought to question Kenneth Winchester, 33, of
Loveland, because his vehicle was seen there the night before the
Bobcat Fire started, Larimer County sheriff's deputy Cindy Gordon
said. No one saw him lighting a fire.
</P>
<P>
   Winchester had declined to talk to authorities. His lawyer, Don
Johnson, did not return a telephone message late Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know the communities touched by this tragic fire will be
disappointed,'' Sheriff Jim Alderden said in a statement. ''But
this is one of those cases where the legal elements establishing
proof beyond a reasonable doubt just weren't there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said the department has no other suspects.

Missile Defense Test Delayed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A technical glitch has delayed a $100 million missile
defense test by at least two hours, Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said. He
said engineers were hoping to fix the problem in a short time, and the test was
still expected to start by midnight EDT. The glitch was related to the power
source for a telemetry device that emits electronic signals from inside the
missile to allow ground controllers to monitor its course of flight, Whitman
explained. The test, if successful, could move the United States a step closer
to building a nationwide anti-missile shield.

   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Armed rebels claiming to support Fijian coup leader George
Speight seized control of the police station in a town outside Suva on Saturday
and took up to 30 hostages, in another escalation of Fiji's government crisis. A
spokesman for the new hostage takers, Iferemi Tiko, told reporters he was a
cousin of Speight and that the latest hostage taking was in support of Speight's
aims to disenfranchise ethnic Indians. Nobody was reported injured and the
rebels said they did not want to see bloodshed.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Coup Supporters Seize Hostages  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL ALEXANDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Armed rebels claiming to support Fijian coup
leader George Speight seized up to 30 hostages on Saturday at a
police station near the capital, in the latest escalation of the
island nation's governmental crisis.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the new captors, Iferemi Tiko, told reporters he
was a cousin of Speight and that the latest hostage taking was in
support of Speight's aims to disenfranchise ethnic Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The captives included local soldiers, police and government
officials.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of injuries and the rebels said they did
not want to see bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, the U.S. Embassy in Suva said ambassador Osman
Siddique was being recalled to the United States for consultations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States continues to be deeply concerned about the
current situation in Fiji,'' the embassy said in a press release.
''We deplore both hostage taking and efforts to deny political
rights to citizens of Fiji.''
</P>
<P>
   About 100 rebels armed with tire irons, steel pipes and other
makeshift weapons took over a military checkpoint in Korovou, about
40 miles outside Suva, early Saturday before confiscating six M-16
rifles and storming the town's small police station.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels demanded the resignation of military head of state
Commodore Frank Bainimarama, echoing one of Speight's key demands.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will hold on here until he steps down. This takeover is
from the people,'' Tiko, his face covered by a ski helmet and
sunglasses, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Tiko said he and his supporters were ''very disappointed'' by
the military's recent tactics at Parliament, where Speight and a
gang of gunmen are holding 27 hostages including deposed Prime
Minister Mahendra Chaudhry.
</P>
<P>
   The army has given Speight and his supporters until midnight
Saturday to leave the area. They also shot and wounded five Speight
supporters in a 15-minute gunbattle Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tiko said he had asked Speight for ''military advice'' before
taking the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The town of Korovou, which is close to Speight's home village,
was generally calm and most stores remained open. The rebels set up
a roadblock outside town made up of a refrigerator, engine parts, a
wheelbarrow and two trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Tiko described the hostages as his ''guests'' and said they were
being treated well -- which is how Speight also describes his
hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, Speight supporters closed the main road between
Fijian capital Suva and Nadi, where the country's international
airport is located.
</P>
<P>
   The army could not immediately be reached for comment but
appealed for calm on national radio.
</P>
<P>
   Days of civil unrest across Fiji -- including local landowners
shutting down the largest island's main hydroelectric power station
-- have shown the depth of support for the rebels and prompted the
military to restart stalled peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Further negotiations were expected Saturday afternoon at the
main army barracks on the outskirts of Suva.
</P>
<P>
   Former insurance executive Speight, who stormed Parliament with
six other gunmen on May 19 and took the government hostage, is
demanding the resignation of a newly installed civilian government
and military commander and head of state Commodore Frank
Bainimarama before he releases his hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels and the military discussed the latest demands Friday in
talks described by both sides as positive.
</P>
<P>
   The military, which took power 10 days after Speight's coup,
recently named an all-ethnic Fijian civilian government to prepare
for elections. Bainimarama retained leadership of the country,
however.
</P>
<P>
   Although the military has met most of Speight's demands to
disenfranchise Fiji's ethnic Indian minority, including deposing
Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, the first Fijian of Indian
ancestry to lead the country, and scrapping the multiracial 1997
constitution, Speight is still refusing to release his hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-one percent of the people are indigenous Fijians and many
resent the clout of ethnic Indians who account for 44 percent and
dominated the ousted government.
</P>
<P>
   A 48-hour deadline for all Speight supporters to leave
Parliament due to expire at midnight on Friday was extended a
further 24 hours.

<HEADLINE> Nixon Watergate Attorney Dies at 72  </HEADLINE>
By SUZANNE GAMBOA
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Charles Alan Wright, an attorney who
represented President Nixon during the Watergate scandal and argued
against the release of the incriminating Oval Office audiotapes,
died Friday. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Wright had been hospitalized since mid-June and died of
complications from lung surgery, said his daughter, Henrietta
Wright of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Wright's arguments against releasing the Oval Office tapes
earned Wright national exposure as a constitutional authority and
accolades for his courtroom arguments.
</P>
<P>
   But they also brought the pressure of fighting an unpopular
battle, and Wright, who served as consultant to the counsel to the
president, was assailed with abusive mail and critical newspaper
articles.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot be happy -- nobody could be happy -- with diminishment
of a reputation as an independent legal scholar,'' Wright said in
1973. ''But if tarnishing my reputation is the price for saving the
presidency and this president, then so be it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not bitter. I have no second thoughts about my role in the
tapes case.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court in 1974 accepted the argument that executive
privilege was a valid concept but ruled 8-0 that Nixon was not
exempt from subpoenas for evidence needed in court cases.
</P>
<P>
   The court ordered Nixon to surrender the tapes, which contained
damaging evidence of White House involvement in covering up the
1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee offices at the
Watergate. Nixon resigned two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Wright was teaching at the University of Texas Law School when
he was first summoned by Nixon to the White House for legal
assistance on a busing issue, Henrietta Wright said. He continued
teaching while he later assisted Nixon on Watergate, though she
said he rarely discussed the case.
</P>
<P>
   Wright was president of the American Law Institute, the nation's
leading organization on legal reform, and held several positions
with the National Collegiate Athletic Association.
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote the 54-volume Federal Practice and Procedure, a
reference that University of Texas Law School Dean Mike Sharlot
said ''no federal courthouse is without.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharlot described Wright as ''the greatest legal scholar of my
lifetime and perhaps of our century.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright taught part-time at the university until his death, and
he had been assisting the university in its appeal of a federal
court ruling that effectively dismantled affirmative action at the
state's public universities.
</P>
<P>
   He also was helping the Episcopal Diocese examine the issues of
single-sex marriages and gays in the priesthood, his daughter said.
</P>
<P>
   Wright grew up in Philadelphia, graduated from Yale Law School,
and was recruited by the University of Texas Law School in 1955.

<HEADLINE> DNC Protesters' Approval Rescinded  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE DeARMOND
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles City Council on Friday
rescinded its earlier approval for demonstrators to use a downtown
square during the upcoming Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came just two weeks after the council members
approved a request to make Pershing Square available to the
protesters. One of the council members, Jackie Goldberg had refused
to support a request by convention organizers for $4 million unless
council members made the square available.
</P>
<P>
   But the council voted 12-1 -- with Goldberg casting the only
negative vote -- to reverse the decision after police and business
owners complained that businesses might be vulnerable if the
demonstrations turned violent.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators may still obtain permits and assemble at Pershing
square, but Goldberg had hoped a special designation would create
''a cooperative and not a confrontational'' atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters tied strips of cloth around their mouths as the City
Council debated the issue on Friday, although at another point the
meeting became raucous as some protesters shouted at council
members.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel its a free speech issue,'' said Brett Doran, a member
of the activist coalition Direct Action Network.
</P>
<P>
   Activists have said as many as 50,000 people may engaged in
protests during the Democrats' convention Aug 14-17. Some activists
already have complained about law enforcement authorities' decision
to establish a wide buffer zone around the convention site, keeping
protesters far from earshot of delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Activists also have criticized the designation of a parking lot
near the Staples Center, site of the convention, as the official
protest area, complaining that it is too far from the site and from
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Police have said protesters are free to demonstrate elsewhere,
outside the buffer zone, as long as they don't break any laws. A
coalition of activists sued the city and Police Department one week
ago for greater access to the event site.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks an injunction to prevent the city and police
from restricting protesters' movement. The suit argues that the
designated protest zones are in areas where convention delegates
will not see them.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Everett, a protester who attended Friday's meeting and
who works with the protesters coalition known as the D2K Network,
said the vote would not affect him.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will go on with our protest, and we'll march to Staples
Center,'' said Michael Everett, who works with a coalition known as
the D2K Network. ''Nothing's changed. We're going to be in Pershing
Square.''

<HEADLINE> Glitch Delays Missile Defense Test  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon's rocket scientists stood ready
Friday to light the fuse on a $100 million missile defense test
which, if successful, could move the United States a step closer to
building a nationwide anti-missile shield. Congress says it is
urgently needed; critics decry it as unworkable.
</P>
<P>
   But late Friday, a technical glitch in the target missile, to be
launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., set back the
launch by at least two hours, Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the problem was a weak battery that supplies power to
the missile's telemetry system, which is needed to help engineers
on the ground record the exact point of impact between the target --
actually a dummy warhead sent aloft by the missile-- and a ''kill
vehicle'' streaking toward it from the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   If the telemetry were not working the Pentagon would lose vital
data. Lt. Col. Rick Lehner, a Pentagon spokesman, said the battery
for the telemetry system was being recharged and all other systems
were functioning normally.
</P>
<P>
   Launch time for the target missile was reset to shortly after
midnight EDT, Lehner said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials had said the latest they would wait before scrapping
the test and rescheduling it for another date was 2 a.m. EDT
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is the future of a multibillion dollar project that has
upset Russia and China and caused many of America's closest
European allies to wince at the prospect of a U.S.-only defense
against missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   Although President Clinton says he will decide soon whether to
keep the project moving toward an anticipated deployment in 2005,
it will be up to his successor to make the final steps to build and
deploy it.
</P>
<P>
   This fast-approaching decision deadline for Clinton gave
Friday's test extra urgency and public attention.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was for an interceptor rocket to launch from an Army
missile range on Kwajalein Atoll in the central Pacific 20 minutes
after a target missile flies aloft from Vandenberg Air Force Base,
Calif. The intent was for a small, maneuverable ''kill vehicle''
carried into space by the Kwajalein rocket to guide itself into the
path of the target missile, pulverizing both in a collision at
16,000 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   If it works, Defense Secretary William Cohen is likely to
recommend to Clinton that he take the first steps in a phased
building plan that would have the missile defense system ready to
use by December 2005.
</P>
<P>
   If it fails, Cohen could still recommend going ahead, but it
would appear more likely that he would favor another option such as
stretching out the timetable to allow for more flight tests. The
Pentagon's independent advisers have said the 2005 timetable may be
overly ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bacon, Cohen's spokesman, said Friday before the test
that Cohen did not expect to make his recommendation for another
three or four weeks and he could not predict what it would be.
</P>
<P>
   This was the third in a series of missile intercept tests. The
first, last October, succeeded. The second, in January, failed.
Friday's test was delayed more than two months to fix the problem
that plagued January's test.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-nuclear activist group Greenpeace hoped to halt
Friday's test by placing a ship in the Pacific where a rocket stage
is expected to splash down about 110 miles offshore from
Vandenberg, said Steve Shallhorn, the group's campaign director.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has asked pilots and sailors to avoid the area
during the test or risk damage or injury but said the test could
continue even with a ship in the zone.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace also set up camp outside Vandenberg's main gate, and
a group of protesters not affiliated with Greenpeace threatened to
delay the launch by breaking into the base. Pentagon officials said
launch preparations were proceeding on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House before Friday's test, spokesman P.J. Crowley
said that even if the missile hit its target there would be weeks
of detailed analysis before the Pentagon could verify that
everything worked properly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would say a hit doesn't automatically suggest success, nor
does a failure automatically come with a miss tonight,'' Crowley
said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest backers of missile defense in Congress, Sen.
Thad Cochran, R-Miss., said in an interview Friday that he believes
America can afford a missile defense even though defense dollars
are tight.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without a doubt, Congress will approve the funding for a
missile defense system'' so long as U.S. military leaders feel
confident it is technologically ready for deployment, Cochran said.
Cost estimates range from the Pentagon's $36 billion to the General
Accounting Office's $60 billion.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the Pentagon must deploy a national missile defense as
soon as it is technologically feasible.
</P>
<P>
   Feasibility and cost are two of four factors Clinton has said he
will take into account in deciding whether to give the Pentagon the
go-ahead to begin preparing a construction site on Shemya Island in
the Aleutians. A high-powered ''X-band'' radar would be built there
to track a missile in flight toward the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The other two factors Clinton will consider are the urgency of
the missile threat against the United States and the implications
of building a missile defense for U.S. foreign relations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton needs to decide soon because construction on Shemya
cannot begin before next spring, leaving barely enough time to
complete the radar and get the rest of the project done by the 2005
target date.
</P>
<P>
   The 2005 date is significant because intelligence officials
believe North Korea will have the capability by then of fielding a
long-range missile that could reach U.S. territory. Recently,
however, North Korea has reaffirmed a pledge not to test any
longer-range ballistic missiles so long as it is engaged in
discussions with the United States about improving diplomatic
relations and reducing the risk of war on the Korean peninsula.

<HEADLINE> Yankees 2, Mets 1  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- For at least one night, the Yankees
re-established themselves as the best team in New York.
</P>
<P>
   With the Yankees' superiority in question for the first time in
years, Paul O'Neill made a home-run saving grab to back Orlando
Hernandez and preserve a 2-1 win over the Mets on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   After Melvin Mora tripled with one out in the eighth inning,
Derek Bell hit a towering drive to right field. O'Neill went back
to the wall and timed his jump perfectly, reaching about two feet
over the eight-foot wall to bring back a sure, game-tying home run.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez (8-6) pumped his fist on the mound and Bell rolled his
eyes in disbelief when O'Neill took the ball out of his glove to
show the umpire.
</P>
<P>
   It was by far the most dramatic moment in a tight Subway Series
opener dominated by Hernandez and Al Leiter (10-2) and witnessed by
54,132 fans -- the largest crowd at Shea in 28 years.
</P>
<P>
   With the Yankees pitching staff in disarray because of recent
injuries to Hernandez, Roger Clemens and Ramiro Mendoza and the
ineffectiveness of David Cone, the World Series champions had
fallen into second place in both the AL East and the city
standings.
</P>
<P>
   That put even added importance on the already over-hyped series
and Hernandez pitched just like it was the playoffs. El Duque, who
is 5-0 with a 1.02 ERA in the postseason, was just as stingy on a
warm July night against the Mets. He allowed one run and five hits
in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   The teams will be back at it early and often Saturday, playing a
1:20 p.m. game at Shea Stadium before trekking across the Triboro
Bridge for a night game at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudy Giuliani -- the highest-ranking Yankee fan in the city
-- watched the game in a box next to the Yankees dugout with GM
Brian Cashman and had to enjoy the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch led off with a walk, but was picked off first.
Leiter, who had beaten the Yankees three straight times, allowed
four straight singles to Derek Jeter, O'Neill, Bernie Williams and
Jorge Posada to fall behind 2-0. Williams has a 17-game hitting
streak.
</P>
<P>
   The All-Star left-hander then retired 19 of the next 20 batters
and wasn't threatened again. But the damage had been done.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was his normal fidgety self on the mound, tugging at
his shirt and hat and demonstratively shaking off signs from
Posada. But he was coolly efficient in his pitching, getting in
front of hitters and keeping the Mets off-balance with his wide
array of pitches and arm angles.
</P>
<P>
   He walked two and struck out four and didn't allow a runner to
reach third base until Mora's triple with one out in the eighth.
Mora scored on Bell's drive, but Hernandez turned over a 2-1 lead
to Mariano Rivera, who earned his 19th save in 22 chances.
</P>
<P>
   After Todd Zeile singled with two outs off Rivera, Jay Payton
lined a potential game-tying double about two feet foul down the
right-field line. Payton hit a routine fly ball to O'Neill to end
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez kept the crowd relatively subdued early in the game.
The slightly pro-Mets crowd perked up in the fifth when Hernandez
walked the first two hitters.
</P>
<P>
   El Duque then brought the Yankees' fans out of their seats when
he speared a line drive by Benny Agbayani, wheeled and threw to
second to double off Zeile. Jeter's relay for a possible triple
play was a shade late.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter, who had won five straight decisions, allowed two runs
and six hits in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Yankees lead the series with the Mets 9-6. ... The
crowd was the biggest at Shea since the Mets drew 54,198 against
Houston on June 10, 1972. ... The Yankees (43-37) have won five of
six games, but are six games behind last year's pace. ... Mora was
called out by home plate umpire Mark Carlson when he ran into the
ball on his bunt attempt in the third inning. ... O'Neill lined a
foul ball off the left shin of first base coach Lee Mazzilli in the
sixth inning. ... The Mets are 14-3 in games started by Leiter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Mike Mussina struck out 10 over eight
innings and outpitched Curt Schilling as the Baltimore Orioles
defeated the Philadelphia Phillies 2-1 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mussina (6-7) allowed one run, seven hits and walked three to
earn his first win since June 16.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling (4-5) pitched his second complete game, allowing two
runs and seven hits. He struck out eight and walked one.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Groom got one out and Mike Timlin recorded the final two
outs for his eighth save.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Belle gave Baltimore a 2-1 lead in the sixth with a
one-out single that scored Mike Bordick, who doubled to lead off
the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Mussina, who has received poor run support, pitched out of
trouble in the early innings. He struck out Mickey Morandini with
the bases loaded to end the first, then retired Morandini on a
liner with two runners on to end the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles have scored just 64 runs in Mussina's 19 starts, an
average of 3.4 a game, the fourth-lowest run support in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Mussina allowed just two earned runs combined in his previous
two starts, but did not record a decision. He has allowed three
runs or fewer in 13 starts, but is just 6-2 in those games.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lieberthal gave the Phillies a 1-0 lead with a RBI single
in the first, but Baltimore tied it in the second on Greg Myers'
RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. Surhoff led off the second with a bloop double to right
that fell between Morandini and right fielder Bobby Abreu. Surhoff
moved to third on a groundout and scored on Myers' liner to center.
</P>
<P>
   Several scouts attended the game to watch Schilling and Mussina,
both former All-Stars who have been the subject of trade rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling retired 11 of 12 at one point and had his fifth
straight strong outing after a tough start.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies stranded eight runners in scoring position. Pat
Burrell doubled with two outs in the eighth, but Morandini lined
out to third to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Phillies starter Robert Person, out with a strained
shoulder, threw from the mound Friday for the second time since
going on the disabled list June 19. He threw about 50 pitches and
said he felt good. He will face hitters Sunday. ... Morandini
stranded five runners in his first two at-bats and six total. ...
Phillies OF Doug Glanville has hit in eight straight games, batting
.385 (15-for-39) in that span. ... Bordick extended his hitting
streak to nine games, batting .405 (15-for-37) in that span.

<HEADLINE> Maine Hockey Coach Has Surgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORONO, Maine (AP) -- Shawn Walsh, who built Maine into a college
hockey power and coached the Black Bears to two national
championships, underwent surgery Friday at a Boston hospital to
remove a cancerous kidney.
</P>
<P>
   His surgeon at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute told WCSH-TV
that the surgery went well.
</P>
<P>
   Urologist Genero Carpinito told the station that Walsh's cancer
had spread to the lymph nodes under his breastbone.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, 45, was told Monday that the kidney was cancerous. He was
cutting back on his speaking engagements, administrative duties and
other tasks away from the team so that he could focus on his
recovery, the university said in a statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The world is full of people who have had to face challenges
like this one,'' Walsh said. ''It's a battle I have to take on and
I am prepared to do so, thankfully with the support of my family
and friends.''
</P>
<P>
   University officials would not discuss the surgery, but the
Portland Press Herald quoted family friends as saying he wanted the
kidney removed as part of an ''aggressive treatment'' designed to
halt the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Bangor Daily News quoted Walsh as saying he probably will
undergo an intensive 20-day immunal therapy program at UCLA's
Jonsson Cancer Center after he recovers from surgery.
</P>
<P>
   During his 16 years at Maine, Walsh compiled a record of
379-203-37 while winning national championships in 1993 and 1999
and taking the Black Bears on five other trips to the Frozen Four.

<P>
	   BETHLEHEM, N.Y. (AP) - Police are investigating the murder of a
state worker whose body was found Friday face down in a culvert,
covered with a blanket.
</P>
<P>
   The body of 47-year-old Cecil Nellenback was found by a town
highway crew at 1:50 p.m., clothed in shorts, short-sleeve shirt
and tennis shoes, police said. He died of severe head injuries,
according to the Albany City Police Department, which is conducting
a joint investigation with town of Bethlehem police.
</P>
<P>
   The body was in an advanced state of decomposition.
</P>
<P>
   Albany police spokesman Det. James Miller said it appeared
Nellenback was murdered somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ''More than likely he was dumped there,'' Miller said. ''It's
kind of an isolated road.''
</P>
<P>
   Bethlehem is five miles southwest of Albany.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Tom Glavine took another step in his turnaround
and Andres Galarraga homered in a five-run second inning as the
Atlanta Braves beat the Boston Red Sox 5-3 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine (9-5) allowed six singles, three by Jose Offerman, in 7
2-3 innings as he won his second straight start after going 0-4 in
his previous seven.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Schourek (2-8) didn't get out of the second inning as the
Braves kept hitting against left-handers and Schourek in
particular. They began the game with a major league best .325
batting average against lefties and went 7-for-11 against Schourek,
who is 2-9 with an 8.25 ERA against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Leading 5-0, the Braves survived a plague of wildness in the
eighth. Nomar Garciaparra drove in one run with a fielder's choice
groundout after Offerman and Jeff Frye singled. Glavine then loaded
the bases by walking Morgan Burkhart and hitting Bernard Gilkey
with a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker came in and walked Ed Sprague to force in a run.
Kerry Ligtenberg replaced Rocker and walked Brian Daubach to make
it 5-3. With the bases still loaded, Jason Varitek ended the threat
with a fly to center. Ligtenberg got four outs for his seventh save
in eight chances.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox returned home on a roll, outscoring Minnesota 44-27
in a four-game sweep. But the Twins have the second-worst record in
the AL, while the Braves lead the NL East despite losing three of
four games to Montreal this week.
</P>
<P>
   One big inning was all Atlanta needed with the way Glavine was
pitching. That came in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga led off with his 20th homer before Javy Lopez singled
and took third on Bobby Bonilla's double. Lopez scored on Reggie
Sanders' groundout. After Walt Weiss struck out, Quilvio Veras was
hit by a pitch. He and Bonilla moved up on the first of Schourek's
two wild pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones then singled in two runs, and Chipper Jones made it
5-0 with a double to center. Schourek, 0-5 in his last 10 starts,
was replaced by Hipolito Pichardo.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine allowed two hits through the first five innings, singles
by Offerman in the first and second. He retired the next 12 batters
before Burkhart singled with two outs in the sixth. Gilkey's fly to
center ended the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox wasted better opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman started the first with a single, but was erased on
Frye's double-play grounder. Boston then loaded the bases when Carl
Everett and Garciaparra walked and Burkhart was hit by a pitch. But
Gilkey looked at a third strike.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague opened the second with a walk and took second on
Offerman's two-out single, but Frye flied to left.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Several policemen stood near the first-base line as Rocker
took his warmup pitches. Others stood in front of the Braves dugout
as he went there after facing one batter. ... Atlanta 2B Veras left
the game with a bruised left forearm after being hit by a pitch in
the second. He scored but was replaced in the bottom of the inning
by Keith Lockhart. ... Glavine was 5-0 in his first seven starts,
2-5 in his next seven decisions. ... Boston is 3-7 in interleague
play. Atlanta is 5-5. ... Offerman extended his hitting streak to
12 games. ... The Braves are 17-2 when Galarraga homers and 6-1 in
their last seven games at Fenway Park.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Fred McGriff hit two solo home runs and the Tampa
Bay Devil Rays rallied against Ryan Dempster to beat the Florida
Marlins 8-3 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bubba Trammell drove in three runs as Tampa Bay improved to 6-4
in interleague play. The start of the game was delayed by rain for
33 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Dempster (9-5), the Marlins' representative in Tuesday's
All-Star game, struck out 11 in 6 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays scored three times with two outs in the sixth to
take a 5-3 lead. Trammell hit an RBI triple and Vinny Castilla and
Felix Martinez singled home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Trammell's double in the seventh drove in Greg Vaughn, who had
singled. Miguel Cairo hit an RBI single in the ninth and Trammell
drove in another run with a grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Albie Lopez (5-6) allowed three runs in 5 2-3 innings. Jim Mecir
pitched two innings for his first save.
</P>
<P>
   McGriff homered leading off the second, then hit his 17th home
run to start the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   McGriff has 406 career home runs, tying him with Duke Snider for
30th on the all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   Florida took a 3-2 lead in the fifth on Derrek Lee's two-run
homer. Mike Lowell singled and Lee connected for his 18th homer.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins scored once in the fourth. Luis Castillo singled,
stole second and advanced to third on catcher's John Flaherty's
throwing error, and scored on Mark Kotsay's sacrifice fly.
Notes: Dempster is the first Canadian pitcher to be selected to
the All-Star game since Ferguson Jenkins in 1972. ... The rain
delay was only the Marlins' second this season. At this point last
year, the Marlins had eight rain delays. ... Vaughn was activated
from the disabled list prior to the game. To make room, the Devil
Rays placed INF Bobby Smith on the 15-day disabled list after
injuring his right knee in a collision with Detroit first baseman
Robert Fick on Wednesday. ... National League opposition is far
from strange for most Devil Rays' players. The Devil Rays currently
have 19 players on the roster who have played in the NL.

<HEADLINE> Notes From Friday's Baseball Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressINTERLEAGUE:
White Sox-Cubs:
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE SOX: 3B Herbert Perry's strong arm should come as no
surprise. He's a former college quarterback at Florida. Perry made
a throw from his knees in the 11th inning Friday that saved the
game against the Cubs. He's made just four errors in 45 games with
the White Sox. ''I know I'm not a superstar and I'll never be
one,'' said Perry, who was claimed off waivers from Tampa Bay early
in the season. ''I've been given a chance to play third.'' ... The
White Sox have won 14 of their last 15 road games.
</P>
<P>
   CUBS: Manager Don Baylor credited the White Sox for sticking to
their plan to go with young players, a move that has finally panned
out. ''I remember not so long ago they had Albert Belle and they
moved him somewhere else,'' Baylor said. But would Baylor be
willing to wait for several years while the Cubs tried the same
approach? ''I think I've been pretty patient right now. I don't
want to wait three years,'' he said. ... Damon Buford already has
12 homers, a career high. He hit 10 with the Red Sox in 1998. ...
Sammy Sosa's 1-for-4 Friday left him 3-for-18 against his former
team, the White Sox, this season. ... Tim Worrell has worked three
scoreless innings in each of his two appearances against the White
Sox this season.
Braves-Red Sox:
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: When Tom Glavine pitches, Braves batters hit. They
averaged 5.5 runs a game in his previous 18 starts this season. And
after just two innings Friday, they already had five runs. ... If
Boston Pops conductor Keith Lockhart, who performed at the
traditional Fourth of July concert along the Charles River, ever
needs someone to pinch hit for him, he better not choose his
namesake. Atlanta infielder Keith Lockhart is 0-for-20 as a
pinch-hitter this season. He entered Friday's game at second base
in the bottom of the second, replacing Quilvio Veras, who had been
hit by a pitch. ... Veras was fourth in the NL with 24 stolen bases
but didn't run like it in the first inning. He got only a single on
a drive off the top of the left-field wall then was thrown out
trying to steal second.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: The revolving door kept turning as Boston made four more
roster moves. Outfielder Curtis Pride, who had been designated for
assignment, was outrighted to Triple-A Pawtucket, and minor league
pitcher Jason Sekany was claimed off waivers by Cincinnati. After
Thursday night's game in Minnesota, the Red Sox sent LHP Tim Young
to Pawtucket and called up first baseman Dernell Stenson from that
International League team. Boston's starting lineup had three
players who were not on the team two weeks ago -- Ed Sprague,
Bernard Gilkey and Morgan Burkhart. ... Jason Varitek had seven
RBIs in his last 11 games. But he was 0-for-12 in his career
against Glavine and didn't start. ... Jose Offerman extended his
hitting streak to 12 games with a first-inning single. He made it
to 11 with a ninth-inning single Thursday in his only at-bat.
Blue Jays-Expos:
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: The Blue Jays, who won two of three from Montreal June
9-11 at SkyDome, are 5-4 against NL opponents this season. ...
Toronto is 11-5 against the Expos, including a 4-1 mark at Olympic
Stadium. The Blue Jays won two of three in Montreal last season.
... SS Alex Gonzalez did not start after reinjuring his strained
right groin in Thursday's 9-6 win in Cleveland. Gonzalez, who is
day-to-day, missed nine straight games from June 25-July 4 due to
the injury.
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: The Expos are 20-9 against AL opponents at Olympic
Stadium since interleague play began in 1997, including 4-2 this
season. Montreal, 5-4 in interleague play this season, has a 31-27
record overall against AL teams. ... 1B Lee Stevens, who hasn't
homered since June 28 against Atlanta's Tom Glavine, remains one
homer short of 100 for his career. ... The Expos are 17-10 in the
first game of a series and 31-25 on artificial turf.
Devil Rays-Marlins:
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Pitcher Alex Fernandez, out since May 18 because of
rotator cuff and elbow problems, will begin a throwing and exercise
program, prescribed by Dr. James Andrews, of Birmingham, Ala. ...
Pitcher Ryan Dempster, the Marlins' representative in Tuesday's
All-Star Game, will pledge $10 for every strikeout he earns this
season to KIDS THAT CARE Pediatric and Cancer Fund. As a result of
Dempster's 109 strikeouts so far this season, he has already
donated $1,090.
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: OF Greg Vaughn was activated from the 15-day disabled
list. To make room for Vaughn, who had been out with a right
hamstring strain, the Devil Rays placed IF Bobby Smith on the
15-day disabled list. Smith suffered a sprain of the medial
collateral ligament in his right knee in a collision with Detroit
1B Robert Fick on Wednesday ... Friday's opener of the three-game
series against Florida will be the Devil Rays' first of 14
consecutive games against teams with .500 records or better.
Twins-Pirates:
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: A number of fans from State College, Pa., are
expected to make the three-hour drive to Pittsburgh to watch Eric
Milton pitch Saturday night. Milton grew up in State College, the
home of Penn State. ... The Twins recalled OF Chad Allen from
Triple-A Salt Lake and sent OF Butch Huskey there outright. Allen
hit .317 with 49 RBIs in 67 games for Salt Lake City. ...
Interleague note: No Twins pitcher has homered since Jim Kaat off
Cleveland's Vince Colbert on June 11, 1972. ... The Twins and
Pirates are playing in Pittsburgh for only the second time. The
Pirates took two of three in Three Rivers Stadium in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: The Pirates optioned LHP Jimmy Anderson to Double-A
Altoona so he can stay on this throwing schedule. He will start
Monday, his normal day to pitch. Anderson, who beat the Cubs on
Wednesday for his first victory since April 15, is scheduled to
rejoin the Pirates next weekend in Cleveland. OF Chad Hermansen was
called up from Nashville because OF Adrian Brown (hamstring) is
expected to miss the weekend series against Minnesota. ... With
Jason Kendall and Brian Giles headed to Atlanta, this is the first
time since 1993 the Pirates have two All-Stars. Kendall was picked
for the third time in five seasons and, if he hadn't gotten hurt
just prior to the All-Star selections last season, probably would
be going for the fourth time in five years. ... The Pirates will
honor their ''Team of the '70s'' before Saturday night's game. The
Pirates won two World Series and six division titles in their first
decade in Three Rivers Stadium. ... Kris Benson, who missed his
scheduled start Wednesday in Chicago because of the flu, will start
Saturday night.
Yankees-Mets:
</P>
<P>
   YANKEES: Reliever Jeff Nelson felt snubbed by manager Joe Torre
for not making the All-Star team. ''I'm sorry he felt that way,''
Torre said. ''Everyone who makes the All-Star team deserves it and
so do a lot of players who don't.'' ... Shane Spencer started in
left field after missing the last two games with a banged-up right
knee. ... C Jorge Posada appealed his one-game suspension for
fighting with Tampa Bay's Bobby Smith last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   METS: Manager Bobby Valentine found one difference with this
Subway Series than past ones. ''The Yankees aren't in first place.
That makes it a lot different, doesn't it?'' ... Valentine said he
hasn't decided yet whether to start Mike Hampton on three days'
rest Sunday or go with left-hander Bobby M. Jones. ... RHP Rick
Reed threw and did light running for the first time since going on
the DL with a broken left wrist and sore calf.
Orioles-Phillies:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: The Phillies won their sixth straight series,
taking three of four in Milwaukee. The last time the Phillies won
six or more consecutive series with no splits was May 2-June 1,
1995 when they won 10 straight. ... Chris Brock did not win any of
his five starts, but won five games in relief over the last month.
... The Phillies will honor 11 members of the pennant-winning 1950
team, the Whiz Kids, prior to Saturday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: 2B Delino DeShields returned to the starting lineup
Friday after missing four games with soreness in his neck and back.
... Jeff Conine started at first base after starting six straight
games at third base. Mark Lewis was at third. ... Mike Bordick
extended his hitting streak to nine games with a first-inning
single. He has hit safely in 33 of his last 40 games.
Indians-Reds:
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: Richie Sexson batted cleanup Friday for the first
time this season. 1B Jim Thome got a day off with left-hander Denny
Neagle starting for Cincinnati. ... Manager Charlie Manuel hopes
that outfielder Manny Ramirez will rejoin the club in a week.
Ramirez, sidelined since May 29 with a strained left hamstring,
began a rehab assignment with Triple-A Buffalo on Thursday. ... LHP
Chuck Finley was 0-for-18 career at the plate heading into Friday's
game.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: The Reds made it official Friday: Their new ballpark
will be named Great American Ballpark. The Great American Insurance
Co., owned by the Lindner family that also owns the Reds, will pay
$75 million for naming rights and marketing rights through 2032.
The ballpark is expected to open in 2003. ... Dante Bichette and
Aaron Boone were out of the lineup. Bichette, hit in the shin by a
pitch Thursday night, still had a severe limp. Boone was still
bothered by a twisted knee. ... The Reds will move Scott
Williamson, the 1999 NL Rookie of the Year, into the starting
rotation and demote Ron Villone to the bullpen. Both have struggled
this season, and manager Jack McKeon hopes a change in roles gets
them going.
Tigers-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: Manager Phil Garner returned to County Stadium Friday
for the first time since being fired by the Brewers last August.
Garner spent nearly eight seasons with Milwaukee and is both the
winningest and losingest manager in franchise history. ... Juan
Gonzalez missed Friday night's interleague game at Milwaukee. The
Tigers slugger has been bothered for weeks by tendinitis in his
left ankle, causing him to miss games periodically. Tony Clark, who
is day-to-day with back spasms, started on Friday. ... Hideo Nomo,
who resurrected his career by going 12-8 with the Brewers last
year, starts for Detroit on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: The Brewers, who left the AL in 1998, took a 97-98
County Stadium record against the Tigers into the weekend
interleague series. ... RHP Jeff D'Amico's ERA dropped to a
team-best 2.45 after allowing one run in 6 2-3 innings in a victory
over Philadelphia on Thursday night. D'Amico (4-4) missed all but
one inning of the last two seasons because of shoulder injuries.
... Luis Lopez, who has been Milwaukee's starting shortstop while
Mark Loretta rehabilitates his broken foot, entered Friday's game
hitting .389 in the Brewers' 10-game homestand. Manager Davey Lopes
has elevated him to the No. 2 spot in Milwaukee's lineup in recent
days.
Royals-Astros:
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: The Royals uniform hasn't been too prominent at the
All-Star game in recent years. For the first time since 1989, the
Royals have two players on the AL All-Star roster, outfielder
Jermaine Dye and first baseman Mike Sweeney. Dye was elected and
Sweeney was added as a reserve by New York Yankees manager Joe
Torre. Bo Jackson and Mark Gubicza represented the Royals in the
1989 All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: With Billy Wagner out the rest of the season following
elbow surgery, the Astros took Octavio Dotel from the starting
rotation and put him in the bull pen. Fine, says Dotel. ''If they
say to me because you throw hard and throw strikes you can help us
a lot as a closer, then I say OK,'' Dotel said. ''I just want to
help them. They told me when Billy comes back that I will be back
in the rotation. They just need me as a closer now. What can I
say?''
Padres-Rangers:
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: Padres closer Trevor Hoffman is trying to join Dennis
Eckersley and John Wetteland as the only pitchers with four seasons
of 40 or more saves. Hoffman is seeking his third consecutive
season with at least 40 saves and he started Friday night one short
of becoming the 17th pitcher in major league history with 250
saves. ... Adam Eaton, Saturday night's rookie starter, has only
one decision (a victory) in his first six starts. Eaton has six
consecutive no-decisions, but has yet to leave a game with the
Padres trailing.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: Reliever Francisco Cordero will miss the San Diego series
due to the death of his grandmother. Cordero returned to his native
Dominican Republic for the funeral. Cordero has been bothered
recently by a sore right shoulder. ... All-Star catcher Ivan
Rodriguez had 77 RBIs in his first 78 games this season. Last
season, he did not reach 77 RBIs until Aug. 8, his 97th game.
Diamondbacks-Athletics:
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: The Diamondbacks purchased the contract of OF Rob Ryan
from Triple-A Tucson of the PCL following Thursday night's 2-1
victory over the Houston Astros. Ryan, who was hitting .303 in 60
games for the Toros, was in the starting lineup. He appeared in 20
games for Arizona last year, batting .241. ... RHP Geraldo Guzman
was optioned to Double-A El Paso of the Texas League after winning
his major league debut Thursday night. Guzman is expected to make
one start in the minors and return in time to start for the
Diamondbacks on July 17. ... OF Steve Finley suffered a bruised
behind during Thursday night's victory over the Astros, was in the
lineup Friday as the DH, but was scratched after taking batting
practice. ''I'm sore down there,'' said Finley. ''There's a nice
little bruise, but other than that I'll live. Hopefully it won't
linger.'' ... First base coach Dwayne Murphy, who played for the
Oakland A's for 10 years, was back in uniform for the Diamondbacks
Friday after missing the past week because of his second knee
operation in a month.
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: RHP Omar Olivares remains on schedule to return to the
rotation on July 17, but had to curtail his throwing before
Friday's game. His goal was 100 pitches, but he made just 19 off
the bullpen mound before reporting pain in his strained shoulder.
''This was the worst day yet,'' said Olivares. A's head trainer
Larry Davis refused to call it a setback though and expects
Olivares to make a rehab start as scheduled on July 12. ''Some days
it will be sore,'' said Davis. ''If he feels OK tomorrow, he'll
throw again. We didn't expect him to throw a 100 pitches, we just
wanted to get him loosened up.'' ... A's manager Art Howe would
love to get RHP Tim Hudson back in the rotation as soon as possible
after the All-Star Game, but it all depends how Hudson is used in
the midsummer classic. His advice to AL manager Joe Torre? ''Don't
use him. Let him watch,'' said Howe, who also said he may save
Hudson to pitch at Coors Field when the A's go there on Sunday,
July 16. ... The three games against Arizona marks the A's shortest
homestand of the season.
Dodgers-Mariners:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: Manager Davey Johnson said he doesn't expect to use
All-Star RHP Kevin Brown in Seattle in the Dodgers' final series
before the All-Star break. Brown pitched eight innings in San Diego
Thursday night in a 9-3 victory over the Padres. He allowed four
hits and had a career-high 12 strikeouts in eight innings.
''Probably not,'' Johnson said when asked if he intended to use
Brown this weekend. ''Unless it's an extra-inning game.'' Johnson
said he thinks Brown might start for the NL in Tuesday night's
All-Star game in Atlanta because Greg Maddux of the Braves and
Randy Johnson of Arizona are scheduled to pitch Sunday. ''Every
manager doesn't even want their pitcher to even pitch,'' Johnson
said when asked if the Dodgers wanted to limit their star pitcher's
All-Star game appearance. ''But it's out of your control.''
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: The Mariners activated RHP Freddy Garcia from the DL so
he could start Friday night's game against the Dodgers. He was on
the DL since April 22 because of a fractured right leg. To make
room for Garcia on the roster, the team placed RHP Frankie
Rodriguez on the 15-day DL, retroactive to July 1, because of an
inflammation of his right shoulder. Rodriguez gave up seven earned
runs in one inning last Friday in Texas. In 19 relief appearances
for Seattle this season, Rodriguez has a 7.08 ERA. Opposing hitters
are hitting .331 against him. Asked about Rodriguez's injury,
manager Lou Piniella said, ''It could explain why he's struggled
some.''
Rockies-Angels:
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: The Rockies faced a pitcher named Ortiz for the second
consecutive game when they opened their series at Anaheim Stadium.
They went against Russ Ortiz on Thursday in San Francisco, a 6-5
Colorado loss, and faced the Angels' Ramon Ortiz on Friday. ...
Heading into the game against Anaheim, the Rockies had lost four
straight for the first time since dropping five in a row last Aug.
6-10.
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: Pitcher Tim Belcher was suspended for three games and
fined Friday for arguing with an umpire during a June 27 game in
Seattle. Belcher, who is 2-2 with a 9.69 ERA and is currently on
the disabled list, is appealing the suspension. ... Garret
Anderson, Troy Glaus and Mo Vaughn are the first Angels trio ever
to have 20 or more homers by the All-Star break. Anderson had 24
going into Friday's game against Colorado, Glaus had 23 and Vaughn
22. The last team to have three players with 20 homers by the break
were the Rockies in 1997, with Larry Walker at 25, Vinny Castilla
22 and Andres Galarraga 22.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Giants-Cardinals:
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: Friday was manager Dusty Baker's 1,153rd game
with the team, passing Roger Craig for the longest tenure since the
team moved to San Francisco. ... Jeff Kent entered the game with 82
RBIs, most before the All-Star break in franchise history. Kevin
Mitchell had 81 in 1989, his MVP year. ... Giants pitchers had a
1.33 ERA in six games during their just-completed series against
Colorado at Pac Bell Park, and had an 11.68 ERA in their seven
games at Coors Field. ... Sean Estes, who starts Saturday, is 7-2
with a 3.39 ERA his last 12 starts. He had no decision against the
Cardinals June 22, giving up five runs in four innings in an 11-10
loss. ... The Giants entered the series short in the outfield, with
Barry Bonds day-to-day with a hairline fracture in his left thumb
and Armando Rios with an injured shoulder suffered in a crash into
the outfield wall on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: RHP Garrett Stephenson is scheduled to start
Saturday, although Friday he said he still felt a bit weak after
two days of illness. Stephenson was supposed to have pitched Friday
but was replaced by Rick Ankiel. ''My attitude is give us what
you've got,'' manager Tony La Russa said. The Sunday starter likely
will be Pat Hentgen on three days' rest. Andy Benes could go on the
normal four days' rest, but the Cardinals want him to start the
first game after the All-Star break next Thursday because that sets
up the rotation better for the second half. Hentgen threw only 85
pitches in seven innings on Wednesday. ... Ray Lankford hit two
home runs Thursday, retying McGwire for the Busch Stadium career
homer lead at 105. He was 10-for-24 the last six games with three
homers, raising his average to .249. ''I'm feeling good at the
plate,'' Lankford said. ''Now, I've got an idea.''

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Support Montenegro Stand  </HEADLINE>
By ALEN MLATISUMA
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Lawmakers on Saturday backed the
Montenegrin government's decision to reject changes to the
constitution -- amendments aimed at concentrating power into the
hands of the Yugoslav president while reducing Montenegro's status.
</P>
<P>
   After a marathon session marked by insults between
pro-independence and pro-Yugoslav camps, 35 of the parliament's 53
representatives voted in favor of the resolution adopted Friday by
the Montenegrin government. The other deputies in the 78-member
legislature were not present or abstained.
</P>
<P>
   The parliament session, which lasted more than seven hours,
revealed the deep divisions between supporters of Montenegro's
pro-Western President Milo Djukanovic and those who stand behind
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   A proposed amendment to the government resolution calling for a
referendum on the republic's independence and proposed by the
Social Democrats was rejected by the lawmakers. The Social
Democrats are partners in Montenegro's ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives broke-off for an hour Friday, after Zarko
Rakcevic, a Djukanovic ally, accused the pro-Milosevic Socialist
People's Party of being ''ethnic cleansers who can only go to The
Hague,'' referring to the U.N. tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   Rakcevic refused to apologize for the remark, saying ''the man
you rally (Milosevic) is indicted and wanted by the tribunal.''
</P>
<P>
   The bickering in parliament reflects the overall political
situation in Montenegro, Serbia's junior partner in the Yugoslav
federation. While backers of Djukanovic support independence, the
pro-Milosevic camp see the Montenegrin president's ideas as
threatening Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Despite threats to begin steps toward independence, following
the decision in Belgrade Thursday to rewrite parts of the federal
constitution, Montenegrin officials declared the changes ''illegal,
illegitimate ... and unacceptable,'' but stopped short of making
moves toward breaking away.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the resolution appealed for ''the citizens of
Montenegro, Serbia's democratic public and the international
community to contribute to peace, and the members of the Yugoslav
army not to be misused against the citizens and the institutions of
Montenegro.''
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional amendments passed in Belgrade on Thursday
envisage that both the Yugoslav president and the parliament's
upper house be chosen in a popular vote, paving the way for
Milosevic's re-election, while downgrading Montenegro's position in
the federation.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro has only 600,000 people, compared to Serbia's 10
million. A direct election of the president and the legislators
cuts its influence in the federation and concentrates power in
Milosevic's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Although Milosevic's popularity is believed to have plummeted
since last year's NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, he retains full
control of the media and state institutions -- limiting the
opposition's chances for a fair election race.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was indicted by an international war crimes tribunal
for atrocities committed during his crackdown in Serbia's Kosovo
province, which triggered last year's 78-day NATO bombing campaign.
Staying in power would be Milosevic's best guarantee against
prosecution.

<HEADLINE> Randolph Wins NCAA Appeal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- High school basketball star Zach
Randolph won an appeal Friday that will allow him to play at
Michigan State next season despite low scores on an entrance exam.
</P>
<P>
   The university learned that the NCAA granted Randolph
full-qualifier status, spokesman John Lewandowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph, a 6-foot-9, 270-pound center from Marion, Ind., had
the necessary grade-point average required by the NCAA, but he was
20 points shy of the score he needed on the SAT.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA did not reveal the reason for its decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm thrilled for Zach Randolph,'' Michigan State coach Tom
Izzo said. ''He made academics a top priority, and all of his hard
work in the classroom has paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   Randolph, considered one of the top recruits in the country, was
tempted to jump straight to the NBA out of high school, but his
desire to attend Michigan State was stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph's high school coach, Moe Smedley, said his reluctance
to go pro probably made an impression with the NCAA. Randolph
hadn't been declared eligible by the NCAA when players had to
commit to the NBA draft, but he continued taking the college
entrance exam.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA requires that freshman athletes have at least a 2.0 GPA
in their core classes and a 900 on the SAT. The minimums are on a
sliding scale, which means the higher the GPA, the lower the SAT
can be.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph, who led Marion to a state title, finished high school
with a 2.7 GPA.
</P>
<P>
   He took the SAT at every opportunity in the past year. Randolph
also spent extra hours working with a high school counselor and was
tutored by a Marion student who received a perfect 1,600 on the
test.

<HEADLINE> Shark Attacks Girl Off Outer Banks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINE ISLAND, N.C. (AP) -- A girl vacationing with her family on
the Outer Banks was attacked by a shark in shallow water, leaving
her with a 9-inch crescent-shaped gash that required more than 300
stitches.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought that someone was grabbing me,'' 12-year-old Ashley
Walker of Chillicothe, Ohio, said Friday of the attack off
Currituck a day earlier. ''It didn't really hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashley had never seen the ocean until she arrived here July 1
with a group of 15 friends and relatives who rented a cottage on
the northern barrier island.
</P>
<P>
   She was playing in the surf at about 4:30 p.m. when she felt
something brush against her, and then a tug. Blood filled the
water, but she didn't realize how badly she'd been hurt until she
reached the shore and saw the gash on her right calf.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Cherry, Corolla fire chief and director of Corolla
Ocean Rescue, said no one saw the fish, but a doctor and emergency
personnel had little doubt it was a shark.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are assuming it's a tiger shark,'' Cherry said. He guessed
the shark had been following fish that came in with Gulf Stream
waters and got closer than usual to shore.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley sustained no torn muscles or ligaments and is expected to
make a complete recovery, said her mother, Wanda Walker. But Ashley
said once was enough for her.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going back in,'' she said.

Glitch Delays Missile Defense Test
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A technical glitch has delayed a $100 million missile
defense test by at least two hours, Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said. He
said engineers were hoping to fix the problem in a short time, and the test was
expected to start shortly after midnight EDT. He said the problem was a weak
battery that supplies power to the missile's telemetry system, which is needed
to help engineers on the ground record the exact point of impact between the
target -- actually a dummy warhead sent aloft by the missile-- and a ''kill
vehicle'' streaking toward it from the opposite direction. The test, if
successful, could move the United States a step closer to building a nationwide
anti-missile shield.

<HEADLINE> Astros 9, Royals 5  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Scott Elarton won his fourth straight decision
and the Houston Astros stopped their six-game home losing streak,
defeating the Kansas City Royals 9-5 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell, Craig Biggio and Mitch Meluskey homered as Houston
ended its longest home losing skid since a seven-game slide in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros have won only four of their last 17 games overall,
and Elarton (8-3) has been the winning pitcher in each of those
victories.
</P>
<P>
   Elarton gave up four hits in 7 1-3 innings and struck out eight.
He left in the eighth, when three Astros errors led to four
unearned runs, two of them coming on Mark Quinn's single.
</P>
<P>
   Elarton, 5-0 at home this season, didn't allow a hit until Jorge
Fabregas homered with one out in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio hit a two-run homer in the third off Blake Stein (0-1).
Stein's wild pitch made it 3-0 later in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell added a three-run homer, his 23rd, in the fifth.
Meluskey hit a solo homer in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 135 homers at Enron Field this season compared
to 118 for the entire season in the Astrodome last season.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio and Richard Hidalgo had RBI hits in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Stein made his appearance in the majors this season and pitched
five innings. He missed the first half of the season with a
fractured right forearm after being hit by a batted ball in a
simulated spring training game Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
   He won his last three minor league tune-up assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Stein retired the first eight batters of the game before Elarton
singled in the third. Julio Lugo hit an RBI double and Biggio
followed with his fifth homer.
Notes: Royals shortstop Rey Sanchez holds the team record for
consecutive errorless games at 59. ... The Astros lead the
interleague series 7-3. ... The Royals are 33-13 this year when
they score five or more runs. They are 5-32 when the score four or
fewer runs. ... The Astros have a 29-22 overall record in
interleague play. ... Elarton is 3-0 in seven starts against the
AL.

   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Tari Phillips had 26 points and 12 rebounds
as the New York Liberty beat the Minnesota Lynx 76-70 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, the WNBA player of the week, recorded her eighth
double-double of the season -- and fifth in seven games -- as she
equaled her career high in rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty (9-9), trailing 33-30 at halftime, opened the second
half with 8-for-9 shooting to take the lead for good at 49-43.
Phillips scored eight points during the run.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's Betty Lennox, a candidate for rookie of the year,
hit a 3-pointer to cut the deficit to 69-67 with 2:15 left.
However, Becky Hammon's layup with 1:27 remaining, and Teresa
Weatherspoon's free throw about a minute later restored the
Liberty's five-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's Katy Smith, the league's leading scorer with a
21.4-point average, scored 12 of her 16 points in the first half as
the Lynx lost their second straight at home.
</P>
<P>
   The Lynx (10-7) jumped off to a 9-0 lead, with Smith scoring
seven points. Lennox had her second double-double with 20 points,
and added a career-high 12 rebounds.

<HEADLINE> Second Earthquake Strikes Nicaragua  </HEADLINE>
By FILADELFO ALEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- The second strong earthquake in as
many days shook Nicaragua Friday, causing houses to collapse and
terrifying residents, radio reports said. There were reports of at
least two deaths and several injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The 5.2-magnitude quake hit at 6:10 p.m. and was centered in the
Laguna de Apoyo, a lake that also was the epicenter of a
5.9-magnitude quake Thursday that killed four children. The lake is
located about 25 miles east of the capital, Managua.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's quake was followed by more than 30 aftershocks with
magnitudes between 3.8 and 4, said the Nicaraguan Institute of
Territorial Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Radio Nicaragua reported that an 8-year-old child and a man were
killed Friday when the wall of a house fell on them. The radio
station did not say where the deaths had occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The head of civil defense, Lt. Col. Mario Perez Cassar, said in
Valle de la Laguna that 79 houses were destroyed and another 1,000
damaged in Thursday's quake, and that 1,762 people had been
evacuated from unsafe areas.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue efforts were complicated by land and rockslides on
the steep road leading into the village. The army sent helicopters
into the area to help take out the injured.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 23, 1972, a magnitude-7 earthquake shoot Nicaragua,
destroying its capital and killing more than 10,000 people.

during a pickup game with his sons at a YMCA. He was 62.
</P>
<P>
   Price was athletics director for Phillips University for 12
years. He was an assistant at Oklahoma and with the Phoenix Suns.

James C. Quayle:
</P>
<P>
   SUN CITY WEST, Ariz. (AP) -- James C. Quayle, an Indiana
newspaper publisher and father of former Vice President Dan Quayle,
died Friday. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle was chairman of Huntington Newspapers Inc. in Indiana. He
owned the Huntington Herald-Press with his wife, Corinne Pulliam
Quayle, since 1964.
</P>
<P>
   He was publisher of that newspaper from 1963 to 1990, except for
six years when he was publisher of The Muncie Star and Evening
Press beginning in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle's newspaper career began as an advertising salesman in
Lebanon, Ind., in 1945 and The Portsmouth Daily Times in Ohio in
1947. He moved to Huntington in 1948 as advertising manager.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle left Huntington in 1955 to go to Phoenix as public
relations and personnel director for The Arizona Republic and
Phoenix Gazette.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Huntington in 1963 as publisher and bought the

and a daughter.
Karl Sweetan:
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Karl Sweetan, who went from an 18th-round draft
choice to starting quarterback for the Detroit Lions in one year,
died Sunday of complications from vascular surgery. He was 57.
</P>
<P>
   Sweetan shares the NFL record for the longest touchdown pass
from scrimmage, a 99-yarder to Pat Studstill on Oct. 16, 1966, at
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions chose Sweetan from Wake Forest in 1966. By midseason,
he was Detroit's starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   In 10 games, he completed 157 of 309 passes for 1,809 yards and
four touchdowns, with 14 interceptions. The Lions went 4-9-1 that
season.
Charles Alan Wright:
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Charles Alan Wright, an attorney who
represented President Nixon during the Watergate scandal and argued
against the release of the incriminating Oval Office audiotapes,
died Friday of complications from lung surgery. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Wright's arguments against releasing the Oval Office tapes
earned him national exposure as a constitutional authority and
accolades for his courtroom arguments.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court in 1974 accepted the argument that executive
privilege was a valid concept but ruled 8-0 that Nixon was not
exempt from subpoenas for evidence needed in court cases.
</P>
<P>
   The court ordered Nixon to surrender the tapes, which contained
damaging evidence of White House involvement in covering up the
1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee offices at the
Watergate. Nixon resigned two weeks later.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ENID, Okla. (AP) -- Oklahoma Storm co-coach Denny Price, the
father of former NBA star Mark Price and the Vancouver Grizzlies'
Brent Price, died Friday of a heart attack after becoming ill
during a pickup game with his sons at a YMCA.
</P>
<P>
   Price, 62, was athletic director for Phillips University for 12
years, coaching the men's basketball team for seven years and the
women's team for more than two years. He was an assistant at
Oklahoma and with the Phoenix Suns.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the United States Basketball League's Storm earlier
this season as associate coach and became co-coach after Ron Ekker
quit a day before the team was to open play in April.
</P>
<P>
   Price watched his sons, Brent and Mark, play one series before
deciding to join them. He made a pass to Mark Price for a 3-pointer
and later to Brent Price for a jump shot, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He couldn't get his breath,'' said Ken Rapp, executive

and he fell on my shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   Rapp performed CPR until paramedics arrived. Price was

in Enid.
</P>
<P>

at Phillips but came back to coach later that season after bypass
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Price played college basketball for Georgia Tech and spent
nine of his 12 seasons in the NBA with the Cleveland Cavaliers.
Brent Price played at Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> 1 Dead in Japan Typhoon  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A typhoon that wreaked havoc and death in the
Philippines slammed into Japan on Saturday, losing power but
maintained enough force to spark landslides and flooding that
killed at least one person and injured two.
</P>
<P>
   TV footage showed residents of Mito, northeast of Tokyo,
trudging knee-deep through torrents of muddy water that raced down
streets and lapped storefronts.
</P>
<P>
   At least 13 homes were flooded in the Tokyo area, while dozens
of others were inundated throughout eastern Japan.
</P>
<P>
   An 81-year-old man drowned after plunging into a flooded canal,
and two people were injured when they were knocked down by the
winds, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   National broadcaster NHK said Kirogi had weakened to 56 mph. As
it approached Japan on Friday, the typhoon was packing winds of 80
mph.
</P>
<P>
   Several domestic flights were canceled and some bullet train
services were suspended, NHK said.
</P>
<P>
   In the early hours of Saturday, the storm lashed the Izu island
chain south of Tokyo before heading northeast to skirt the Pacific
coast of Japan's main island of Honshu.
</P>
<P>
   The festival hall of a shrine and three homes were demolished by
landslides overnight on Kozushima, where 788 residents had been
evacuated to a high school on higher ground, said local official
Chizuru Ishida.
</P>
<P>
   There were no injuries. But damage to buildings and roads was
extensive on the island in the Izu chain that was rocked by a
magnitude 6 tremor on July 1 that killed one person, Ishida said.
</P>
<P>
   As skies cleared, officials prepared to lift the typhoon
evacuation order for residents on the island, about 90 miles south
of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people were evacuated from their homes two weeks ago
when a volcano rumbled to life on Miyakejima Island near Kozushima,
setting off hundreds of earthquakes and tremors in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The typhoon killed 12 people when it moved through the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile a tropical storm in the South China Sea was upgraded
to a typhoon and headed for mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   In the Philippines, floods and rain from typhoons bracketing the
region drove 400,000 people from their homes, officials said
Friday. At least 16 people were dead and 10 missing.
</P>
<P>
   Kirogi caused no problems in Okinawa, southern Japan, when it
passed by hundreds of miles out to sea Thursday. But concerns
remain that the typhoon season could produce a strong storm during
a July 21-23 summit of leaders of the Group of Eight industrialized
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Typhoon Kai-tak was about 375 miles east-southeast of Hong Kong
at 9 p.m. and expected to remain nearly stationary overnight, the
Hong Kong Observatory said.
