<HEADLINE> Iraq to Celebrate OPEC Founding Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraq will hold celebrations next
month to mark the 40th anniversary of the founding of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the official
Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A source from the Iraqi oil ministry said that Iraq has been
preparing "magnificent" ceremony for the event. OPEC was
established in the Iraqi capital Baghdad on September 14, 1960.
</P>
<P>
The celebrations will start from September 11 and last for about
two weeks to greet the forthcoming OPEC summit meeting to be held
in the Venezuelan capital Caracas, the source said. Iraq will also
participate in the celebrations in Caracas for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
On that occasion, Iraq will present folklore and fashion shows,
music, an exhibition of antiques and books concerning Iraq's
religion and scenic spots.
</P>
<P>
A number of officials from the ministries of foreign affairs,
finance, cultural and information will be present at the Caracas
celebrations, said the source.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral relations between Iraq and Venezuela have
witnessed a big step forward after Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
visited the country on August 10, the first such visit by a head of
state since the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Chavez toured Iraq and other nine members of OPEC to invite all
OPEC members to attend the summit meeting in Caracas next month.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela and Iraq are both sponsor nations of OPEC. On
September 10, 1960, representatives from Iraq, Venezuela, Iran,
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait held a meeting in Baghdad to safeguard the
oil prices. Four days later, they announced the founding of the
world's biggest oil cartel.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Military Operation in Palestinian Village Condemned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official Sunday
denounced the Israeli military operation in a West Bank village
Saturday night as a "heinous act."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) condemned the operation
which took place at a time when negotiations were being held
between the Palestinians and Israel, said Speaker of the
Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) Ahmed Qurei (also known as
Abu Ala).
</P>
<P>
Three Israeli soldiers were killed in a shootout when hundreds
of Israeli soldiers stormed the Palestinian village of Assira
Ashamalieh near Nablus, which is believed to be one of the
strongholds of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement, or
Hamas.
</P>
<P>
During the clashes, Mahmoud Abu Hanoud, the number one fugitive
on Israel's most-wanted list, was also wounded. But he escaped from
the house besieged by the IDF in Nablus and gave himself up to the
Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli authorities said that the three soldiers "
were killed by friendly fire" and investigations are still
underway.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a statement by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
that the Israeli General Security Services might ask the PNA to
hand over Hanoud, West Bank Preventive Security Commander Gebril
al-Ragoub said the Palestinian side would never yield to Israel's
pressure.
</P>
<P>
He added that Israel had to coordinate with the Palestinian
security forces before carrying out its military operation in the
village, which is under Palestinian civilian administration but
under Israeli security control.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by three helicopters, the IDF besieged the village
at midnight in a bid to arrest Hanoud, who was accused of being
behind two anti-Israeli suicide bombings in Jerusalem in 1997,
killing and injuring 21 Israelis. The IDF early Sunday morning blew
up a house where the clash with Hamas militants took place.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Rejects Israeli Sovereignty over Jerusalem: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Ali Abu Ragheb said
here Sunday that Jordan firmly rejects any form of Israeli
sovereignty over Jerusalem, and the kingdom's interests must be
protected in the final status peace talks between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Ragheb told a press conference that Jordan has never presented
any different suggestions on the future status of Jerusalem, and it
is persistent in its support for the establishment of a Palestinian
state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war
and later annexed it, and declared Jerusalem as its eternal and
indivisible capital, which is not recognized internationally.
</P>
<P>
The future of the holy city is one of the thorniest issues in
the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks which also focused on the
return of Palestinian refugees, water, borders and security
arrangements between Israel and a future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Ragheb said Jordan is, and will continue to be, one of the basic
pillars of peace process in the region, but no peace solutions can
ignore Jordan's interests, particularly on the Palestinian refugees
issue.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is hosting some 1.5 million Palestinian refugees, most of
whom had been given Jordanian citizenship. But the government said
it does not mean they had given up their rights to return home or
stay in Jordan while asking for compensations from parties
concerned.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has direct interest in the ongoing final status
negotiations between the Palestinians and Israel, and has been
well-informed about what is going on concerning the refugee issue,
Ragheb said.
</P>
<P>
Israel, the Palestinians, and the United States had confirmed to
Jordan that it would be involved in the interpretation of the
status of Palestinian refugees, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said Jordan's position on the refugee issue is based on the
U.N. Security Council Resolution 194, which stipulates the right of
return and compensation, and the kingdom has relayed this position
in written forms to Palestinian and Israeli negotiators.
</P>
<P>
The U.N., the U.S. and the European Union have also been
informed of the Jordanian stand, he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the U.S. role as a major broker in the peace
process, Ragheb said "We have good relations with America
particularly on the political and economic levels, and we believe
that the U.S. is a partner to Jordan in all areas."
</P>
<P>
Washington takes Jordan, which signed a peace treaty with Israel
in 1994, as an ally in the Arab world, and provided some 300
million U.S. dollars in various economic and military aid packages
to the kingdom in 1999.

<P>
LAGOS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The West Side Boys, a rebel group
in Sierra Leone, has put forward a number of conditions for the
release of 11 British soldiers abducted by them, said a report
reaching here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A senior Sierra Leonean government official was quoted as
saying in the capital Freetown that the rebels had reportedly

safe release of the soldiers, who are reportedly "in good
condition".

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pledges Most Favorable Trade Treatment for Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- U. S. President Bill Clinton
Sunday pledged inflow of American investment and tariff cuts for
Nigerian products at a business forum during his second-day visit
to the West African country.
</P>
<P>
Some categories of products originated from Nigeria will enter
the U.S. market duty free, making the country enjoy the most
favorable trade treatment in the world except some South American
countries, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"The road has been laid by the two governments, but the cars
have to be made by the business sectors," he told the party
attended by VIPs from both Nigerian and American business sectors.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his pledge that the U.S. government would do its
part to help reduce Nigeria's debts, and urged Nigerian
businessmen to make sure that the benefit from the debt relief
will add to the country's economic recovery in the long-run.
</P>
<P>
He also urged Nigerians to take advantage of the information
technology and put more emphasis on education.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived here Saturday morning for a two-day official
visit to the most populous country in Africa.
</P>
<P>
It's the second official visit by an American president, after
Jimmy Carter's 20 years ago. It is also Clinton' s second trip to
Africa after his last one to Ghana and Botswana in 1998.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Clinton held talks with President Olusegun
Obasanjo several times and addressed a joint session of the
National Assembly, the country's top legislature, on Saturday.

Clinton visited a village in the suburbs of the capital Sunday
morning and attended a party on women's development at noon before
attending the business forum late afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vows to Support Nigeria's Fight Against HIV/AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton has pledged to provide 10 million U.S. dollars to Nigeria
this year in support of its fight against HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a forum on "United States and Nigeria: Jointing
Forces Against AIDS" in the capital Abuja on Sunday, Clinton said
the grant is three times bigger compared to what the United Sates
provided for the same purpose last year.
</P>
<P>
The United States would also provide 9 million dollars in
support of Nigeria's fight to eradicate polio and 2 million
dollars to help protect Nigerian children from Malaria through the
distribution of bed nets, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Parker Foundation of the United States would also
provide 35 million dollars in grants over the next five years to
improve reproductive health of Nigerian women.
</P>
<P>
The president further promised that the United States would
give Nigeria medicines, especially those that would prevent
transfer of AIDS from pregnant women to their babies. The
infectious diseases could drop in Nigeria and other African
countries just like it had done in America, he said.
</P>
<P>
It was unfortunate that 3 million Nigerians were already living
with AIDS, he said, calling for concerted actions to stop the
spread of the deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
"AIDS can rob a country of its future. I know you will not let
that happen to Nigeria," Clinton said, noting that the fight
against AIDS was not that of Nigeria alone but that of Africa,
America and the entire world.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived in Abuja on Saturday with a 1,000-strong
delegation for a two-day state visit to the most populous African
country.

ABUJA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton Sunday called on the Nigerian business community to
embrace economic reforms and privatization, describing them as the
key to development.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a business forum under the theme "Investing in
Nigeria's Future" in the capital Abuja, Clinton said Nigeria needs
to improve access to information technology in order to take
advantage of the benefits of the explosion in technology.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria needs to increase the number of its citizens having
access to the Internet to enable the country to take advantage of
the "collapse of time and distance" inherent in Internet
technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said one of the central themes of his visit to Nigeria is to
help the country reduce its foreign debt burden, which is
estimated at about 30 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Describing the United States and Nigeria as being in the same
boat, Clinton said "we are all in the same boat, so let us sail."

<HEADLINE> Fire Spreading at TV Tower in Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A fire that broke out Sunday
afternoon at the local Ostankino TV power is spreading to the
lower sections of the world's second tallest freestanding
structure amid reports of several people missing inside a jammed
elevator.
</P>
<P>
The fire, which broke out at a height of 475 meters, have
spread to the height of 280 meters and is moving to lower levels,
the Interfax news agency reported, quoting city fire brigade
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Almost all television programs and many radio broadcasts have
been knocked off the air. Mobile communications and paging
services were also affected.
</P>
<P>
To fill the information void created by the fire, the Itar-Tass
news agency started to provide what it described as open access to
all its information from its web site.
</P>
<P>
President Vladimir Putin summoned Minister of Communications
Leonid Reiman to the Kremlin and discussed the possibility of
using reserve channels to restore the TV broadcasting and secure
uninterrupted work of communication facilities, ambulance service,
the Interior Ministry and other services, the Kremlin press
service said.
</P>
<P>
The fire was allegedly caused by a short circuit at the
transmitter of a paging company, but the authorities have not
ruled out the possibility of sabotage.
</P>
<P>
After the outbreak of the fire, Moscow police received an
anonymous call that said a bomb had planted in the TV tower and
that it would explode shortly, Interfax reported, quoting a source
with law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers are continuing their efforts to free several people
trapped in a fallen elevator that was jammed somewhere in the
tower by emergency blocks.
</P>
<P>
The search team reached a height of 311 meters but could not
proceed further because of high concentration of smoke. The
elevator has not been located, and contact with those trapped
inside has been lost.
</P>
<P>
In addition to those stranded in the fallen elevator, three
people received medical attention because of the fire, Interfax
said.
</P>
<P>
A female TV crewmember was in a shock and two firemen were
slightly poisoned by monoxide fumes.
</P>
<P>
The Ostankino TV and BC center, inaugurated in November 1967,
is the second tallest freestanding building in the world, just
after the TV tower in Toronto, Canada.
</P>
<P>
Weighing more than 55,000 tons, the structure is 540 meters
tall. Visitors can reach the observation deck at 337 meters in 58
seconds by the elevator.
</P>
<P>
There are three dining rooms below the observation deck.
</P>
<P>
Konstantin Ernst, general director of the state ORT television
channel, said full restoration of the TV broadcasting to Moscow
and the Moscow region could take up to three months.

The market had more than 190 million consumers with a
cumulative gross domestic product of more than 180 billion U.S.
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Agricultural Output to Decline This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's agriculture sector is
expected to decline by 4.2 percent in real terms in 2000, compared
to a growth rate of 1.9 percent in 1999, Zimbabwe Financial
Holdings (Finhold), the country's main financial institution said
in a report released here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the production of crops such as wheat, cotton,
soybeans, coffee and horticulture was caused by heavy flooding
associated with Cyclone Eline, shortages of fuel and foreign
currency and the disruption to farming activities due to the
occupation of white-owned farms by the war veterans, Finhold said.
</P>
<P>
"The acquisition of some commercial farms by the government for
resettlement purposes in the maize growing belt is likely to
result in a reduction in areas under maize," said Finhold in a
review of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
During the 2000/2001 season production of flue-cured tobacco
was likely to decline by about 20 percent due to inadequate land
preparation, shortage of fuel and low tobacco prices, it said.
</P>
<P>
Horticultural exports were affected by the continued management
of the exchange rate in the greater part of the year, but growth
in exports were likely to improve now because of the devaluation
of the Zimbabwean dollar by 25 percent this month.

GAZA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Three Israeli soldiers were killed
Saturday night in a clash with the Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas) in north West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The clash erupted when hundreds of Israeli soliders stormed
Palestinian village of Assira al Shamaliyah, which is believed to
be the stronghold of Hamas and home to Mahmoud Abu Hanoud, who
topped Israel's most wanted list for conspiring bombings in Israel.

<HEADLINE> 3 Israeli Soldiers Killed in Clash With Hamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Three Israeli soldiers were killed
in a shootout with Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas)
Saturday night in northern West Bank, Israeli army confirmed
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The clash erupted at 10 p.m. (1900 GMT) Saturday night when
hundreds of Israeli soliders stormed the Palestinian village of
Assira Ashamalieh near Nablus, which is believed to be one of
Hamas' strongholds and home to Mahmoud Abu Hanoud, the No.1 on
Israeli most wanted list.
</P>
<P>
Abu Hanoud was believed to be the mastermind for two suicide
bombings in Jerusalem in 1997, in which 43 people, including five
militants, were killed. He is considered a leader of Hamas'
military wing, Izzedine al Qassam, which has carried out a serious
of suicide bombings.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian militant group Hamas opposes making peace with
Israel and favors armed struggle to retrieve lands occupied by
Israel. It has carried out a series of bombing attacks on Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses of the Palestinian village said they heard gunfire
when the Israeli troops surrounded the region and began a house-to-
house search.
</P>
<P>
They also said Israeli helicopters hovered overhead to
illuminate the village and at the beginning, Israeli side refused
to allow ambulances to enter the village that is jointly-controlled
by Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Radio of Israel said Sunday Abu Hanoud was injured in the clash
and is under Palestinian custody.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian security sources confirmed that Abu Hanoud is
treated for gunshot wounds at the heavily-guarded Evangelical
Hospital in the Palestinian-controlled Nablus and was in good
condition.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Israeli authorities said they had discovered a group
of militants in connection with Saudi Arabia-born militant Osama
Bin Laden in the Palestinian-controlled region.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Palestinian police discovered what they called
a explosives plant in totally-Palestinian-controlled Nablus and
arrested some Hamas members.

<HEADLINE> Rallies Turn Violent in Western Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Clashes broke out Saturday evening
in Iran's western city of Khorramabad in Lorestan province as
groups of people conflicted over a pro-reform conference.
</P>
<P>
A group of people rallied in support of the seventh annual
conference of the Office to Foster Unity (OFU), the most
influential student organization in Iran which supports President
Mohammad Khatami's reform programs.
</P>
<P>
But the rallies were hindered and disturbed by unidentified
assailants, which led to clashes, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported Sunday. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
The conference kicked off in Khorramabad on Wednesday with
President Khatami's message, but some groups had protested the
conference and the provincial security department had reportedly
demanded that the OFU member students end their meeting.
</P>
<P>
Some reformist figures were also blocked from entering the
conference site.
</P>
<P>
The clashes finally ended with the intervention of security
forces, but no injuries or arrests were reported.
</P>
<P>
Following the landslide victory of reformers in February's
parliamentary election, the conservatives, who still control the
system, have stepped up their efforts to undermine the reformist
campaign encouraged by President Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The conservative judiciary has thus far banned more than 20 pro-
reforms papers and journals and imprisoned a number of reformist
figures on charges of violating Islamic principles and advocating
American-style reforms.
</P>
<P>
The conservative authorities also directed their affiliated
groups, such as the Basij (voluntary forces formed by students) and
the hardline Ansar-e Hezbollah, to obstruct pro-reform rallies and
movements, which often led to violence.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Drafts Law to Fight Cyber Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus is drafting legislation to
fight computer crimes and Internet porn as part of its European
Union (EU) harmonization process, the Sunday Mail newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
The legislation is expected to be in force by the middle of next
year.
</P>
<P>
"We are drafting legislation on cyber crime generally," said
George Panayiotou, an official at Cyprus' police research
department, adding that a special committee within the Justice
Ministry is preparing the legislation.
</P>
<P>
Panayiotou said current legislation is adequate to cover
Internet crime such as fraud, but the new law will be more
specific.
</P>
<P>
So far, he said, no one in Cyprus has ever been arrested or
charged with any sort of cyber crime, and it is too early to say
where the legislation would draw the line as far as the invasion of
privacy is concerned.
</P>
<P>
Local media recently reported that Interpol had asked Cyprus
police to investigate the circulation of child pornography material
on the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian to Establish DNA Database for Police Investigations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian police are planning to
build up a nation-wide DNA database to help investigate criminal
cases, the semiofficial daily Jordan Times reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
DNA, the shorthand for deoxyribonucleic acid, carries the entire
genetic code of an individual, and the database will help police to
match genetic materials recovered from the scene of a crime with
records from the database.
</P>
<P>
The slightest specimen like hair, nail, blood, skin, semen and
so forth, contains the unique DNA of an individual which will help
police trace down the suspect of a crime.
</P>
<P>
The Public Security Department, the headquarters of the
Jordanian police, planned to establish the DNA database from the
beginning of next year, Jordan Times said.
</P>
<P>
The employment of DNA technique (sometimes called DNA
fingerprinting) is similar to the finger printing process, relying
on each person's unique genetic code to confirm his or her
identity.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the DNA database will be one of the efforts
by the Jordanian police to combat the rising crime rate of the
kingdom triggered by poverty and high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
One third of the kingdom's 4.7 million population live under the
poverty line, or less than 80 Jordanian dinars (112 U.S. dollars) a
month.
</P>
<P>
The official unemployment rate stands at over 14 percent if not
at 27 percent by independent estimates.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Paper Condemns U.S., Britain on No-Fly Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's official daily has chided
the U.S. and Britain for imposing no-fly zones on Iraq, saying the
two countries have been exploiting the restricted areas "for pure
aggressive and espionage purposes."
</P>
<P>
The Ath-Thawra newspaper said the U.S. and Britain capitalized
on the situation following the 1991 Gulf War and set up the no-fly
zones over northern and southern Iraq "in an overt interference in
Iraq's internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its Western allies clamped a no-fly zone in the
north on April 7, 1991 and the other one in the south on August 27,
1992, with a claimed aim of protecting a Kuridsh enclave and
Shi'ite Muslims from possible attacks of Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British planes based in Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait
have since enforced the no-fly zones, not recognized by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain has since used the no-fly zones as a
pretext to proceed with their aggressive policy against Iraq, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The unilateral decision by the U.S. and Britain to establish the
air exclusion zones has got no authorization from the United
Nations Security Council, the paper stressed.
</P>
<P>
The paper held the U.S.-British alliance "fully responsible" for
any consequences of their "illegitimate hostile acts," as Iraq
has "full right of self defense" according to the International
Law.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been challenging the U.S. and British warplanes
overflying the two zones since the U.S.-British air strikes in
December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Yassin Jasim, major general of the Iraqi Air Defense Command,
claimed that the Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery had shot down more
than 10 U.S. and British planes. "We have evidence to prove that,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The claim could not be confirmed by the U.S. and Britain.

<P>
JERUSALEM, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak would view a unilateral
declaration of statehood by the Palestinians as sufficient reason
to bring the right-wing opposition Likud into his coalition,
Barak's spokeswoman Merav Parsi-Zadok said Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
She said Barak would announce the guidelines he would like to
follow in forming a coalition within two or three weeks, adding it
depends on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- A heavy exchange of fire Saturday night was reported in the
north of the Palestinian West Bank city of Nablus. Palestinian
sources said Israeli forces, accompanied by four helicopters which
circled overhead, surrounded the village of Atzira al-Shimaliya in
Area B, where Palestinians hold civil control but security is in
Israeli hands. The village is the home to Mahmoud Abu-Hanoud, the
most wanted Hamas leader by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli police have arrested the serial arsonist responsible
for the recent spate of fires at sex shops and brothels in the Tel
Aviv area, including a blaze which killed four prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
Tel Aviv police ambushed Yari Baruchim, 34, early Saturday
morning as he was allegedly preparing to launch firebomb attacks on
other sites.
</P>
<P>
Baruchim, who is an pious Jew, said it was his mission to purify
the city since the police were not doing so.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- United States President Bill Clinton, currently on a three-
day visit to Africa, is to make a hastily arranged stopover in
Egypt on Tuesday for talks with President Hosni Mubarak in a bid to
study proposals Mubarak has made on Jerusalem and to press
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to be more flexible.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which receives some 2 billion dollars in U.S. military
aid annually, was criticized in the U.S. for not having pressured
Arafat to make concessions at last month's Camp David summit.

<HEADLINE> Committee Appointed to Probe Shootout With Hamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Shaul Mofaz, Chief of General
Staff of the Israel Defense Force (IDF), appointed a committee
Sunday to investigate a overnight shootout with Palestinian
militant group in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Three IDF soldiers were killed in the clash with "Palestinian
terrorists" near Nablus Saturday night and a fourth one was
injured, apparently by "friendly fire," the IDF spokesman's office
said Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
The IDF soldiers from an elite unit operating in the Nablus
region were ordered to "manhunt Palestinian terrorists" and the
most wanted Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) terrorist Mahmoud
Abu Hanoud, the office said.
</P>
<P>
Hamas opposes making peace with Israel and favors armed
struggles to retrieve lands occupied by Israel. The Palestinian
radical group has carried out a series of anti-Israeli attacks
since Israel and the Palestinians signed the Oslo peace accords in
1993.
</P>
<P>
Abu Hanoud was accused of masterminding two suicide bombings in
Jerusalem in 1997, in which dozes of people, including five
militants, were killed.
</P>
<P>
A heavy exchange of fire erupted around midnight in the village
of Atzria Shimaliya, north of Nablus, and later on IDF troops,
accompanied by four helicopters hovering overhead, surrounded the
village.
</P>
<P>
The IDF early Sunday morning blew up a house, where the clash
with "Palestinian terrorists" took place, the office said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian authorities were kept informed about the
manhunting and other IDF activities in the area and the Israeli
side has to look into the events and investigate the incident,
Mofaz said.
</P>
<P>
The village is in Area B, which is under Palestinian civilian
jurisdiction but under Israeli security control.
</P>
<P>
The IDF had recently carried out several manhunting of the "
Palestinian terrorists" in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
On August 16, they shot and killed a 73-year-old Palestinian
man, Mahmoud Abdullah, in the village of Surda, north of Ramallah.

CAIRO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- Syrian Industry Ministry and Italian Land Mark
Company inked a 5-year renewable contract on exporting a minimum of
150,000 Syrian-made shoes to European markets every year within the
trade activity of the Syrian-European Union Business Council.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish Airlines (THY) has planned to carry 12
million passengers by 2001.
</P>
<P>
THY Deputy President Gurol Yuksel said in Istanbul Saturday that
the number of passengers THY carried in July and August was the
highest in its history.
</P>
<P>
Yuksel said the total number of passengers the company carried
had reached 8.2 million by August 2000.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey's major private air company, Istanbul Airlines,
has suspended flights indefinitely due to severe financial
problems.
</P>
<P>
Istanbul Airlines, which was founded 16 years ago, had reduced
its fleet from 17 planes to two over the past several years. It was
sharply affected by last year's dramatic drop in tourism following
two devastating earthquakes and threats from Kurdish rebels to
attack tourists.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey is expected to export 600,000 tons of flour in
2000, compared with 500,000 tons in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General of the Turkish Flour Millers' Association,
Ilker Tanik, explained that there were poor wheat harvests in East
European and Middle East countries, which offer good opportunities
for Turkish exports.
</P>
<P>
But the government's Soil Products Office wants to export more
wheat in 2000-2001.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish state-run steelmaker Erdemir is expected
to export 500,000 tons of flat steel in 2000, bringing earnings of
150 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Erdemir's Deputy General Manager Kemal Ozden told reporters over
the weekend that his company was most likely to exceed its revised
2000 output target of 3.1 million tons, predicting that the revenue
would be higher than its target of 1 billion U.S. dollars.

ANKARA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said on Saturday that "
there are some uncertainties between authorities of the presidency
and the government. We will bring authorities of the presidency
onto agenda."
</P>
<P>
He said "it is too early to say something" about restricting
authorities of the president, but "if we cannot remove these
uncertainties, serious problems may occur."
</P>
<P>
The tension between President Ahmet Necdet Sezer and the
government emerged because of the president's rejection of a
governmental decree for the sacking of civil servants involved in
fundamentalist activities.
</P>
<P>
Yenibinyil:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkey submitted to Tehran once again the documents revealing
Iran's support to the radical Islamic terrorist group Hezbollah and
separatist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The report, conveyed to Iranian Deputy Prime Minister Mohsen
Aminzade who paid an official visit to Ankara last week, said that
members of the Hezbollah have received military and religious
training in Iran, leaving Iran in a difficult position.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet:
</P>
<P>
-- Ecevit has launched an investigation into the burglary of
eight paintings worth millions of U.S. dollars from the Prime
Ministry residence.
</P>
<P>
A recent counting of inventory stock revealed that eight
paintings were missing. The Prime Ministry Inspection Council has
taken actions to find the lost paintings upon directions of the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>

-- As a result of a research carried on 123 bridges and viaducts
in Istanbul, it was understood that most of them can collapse in a
possible earthquake.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that those bridges and viaducts should be
reinforced, adding that the reinforcement could cost 10 percent of
the construction cost of the bridge or viaduct.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Continue Fighting Terrorism: Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Israel will continue to fight
all kinds of terrorist activities despite the heavy prices it has
to pay, Prime Minister Ehud Barak said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In his condolences to the families of the three soldiers of the
Israel Defence Forces (IDF) killed overnight in clashes with
Palestinian militant group Hamas in the West Bank, Barak said the
loss of life of the IDF soldiers could not prevent Israel from
fighting terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Shaul Mofaz, chief of general staff of the IDF, appointed on
Sunday a committee to investigate the incident.
</P>
<P>
Mofaz was quoted by the Israel Radio as saying that he did not
rule out the possibility that the three IDF soldiers "were killed
by friendly fire."
</P>
<P>
The IDF spokesman's office said earlier that the three IDF
soldiers were killed in the clash with "Palestinian terrorists"
near Nablus during Saturday night and a fourth one was injured,
apparently by "friendly fire."
</P>
<P>
The IDF soldiers from an elite unit operating in the Nablus
region were ordered to "manhunt Palestinian terrorists" and the
most wanted Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) terrorist Mahmoud
Abu Hanoud, who was accused of being behind two anti-Israeli
suicide bombings in Jerusalem in 1997.
</P>
<P>
He is considered a leader of Hamas' military wing, Izzedine al
Qassam, which has carried out a serious of suicide bombings.
</P>
<P>
A heavy exchange of fire erupted around midnight in the village
of Atzria Shimaliya, north of Nablus, and later on IDF troops,
accompanied by four helicopters which circled overhead, surrounded
the village.
</P>
<P>
The IDF early Sunday morning blew up a house, where the clash
with "Palestinian terrorists" took place, the office said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian authorities were kept informed about the
manhunts and other IDF activities in the area and the Israeli side
has to look into the events and investigate the incident, Mofaz
said.
</P>
<P>
The village is in Area B, which is under Palestinian civilian
jurisdiction but under Israeli security control.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Sunday also ordered the
Palestinian security to investigate the event.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami on Sunday termed
the event a very serious one, but he did not ask the Palestinian
side to extradite Abu Hanoud for trial.
</P>
<P>
Abu Hanoud has turned himself in to the Palestinian security
earlier Sunday at a hospital in Nablus, where he was reportedly
treated for three gun shots on his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
The IDF had recently carried out several manhunts of the "
Palestinian terrorists" in the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Israeli PM Says Negotiation Ball Now in the Palestinians' Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said Sunday that in terms of the negotiations with the
Palestinians, the ball is now in Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's
court.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Sunday morning's weekly cabinet meeting, Barak
stressed that it should be the Palestinians who will decide whether
or not to move toward a peace deal, according to a statement issued
by his office.
</P>
<P>
If Arafat decides not to renew efforts, the statement added, he
must then "bear the responsibility for the deadlock which is liable
to be created."
</P>
<P>
The most recent peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians
at the Camp David of the U.S. last month failed to reach an
agreement over core final-status issues to pave the way for a
permanent peace deal by September 13.
</P>
<P>
Amid lower level talks between the two sides, Israeli and
Palestinian leaders launched an international campaign respectively
to explicate their stands on the talks.
</P>
<P>
Barak claimed Sunday that in such diplomatic contacts, most of
the world understands that the ball is in Arafat's court.
</P>
<P>
"This is a tangible sign of both Israel's diplomatic achievement
and the turnaround in our international position," Barak said.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes the coming few weeks will be crucial for the
peace process as Arafat makes a decision. The two leaders are all
scheduled to meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton at the United
Nations millennium summit in New York next month.
</P>
<P>
Barak accused the Palestinians of adopting an uncompromising
position regarding the talks, saying that "while only one side is
necessary to force a confrontation, an agreement requires both
sides."
</P>
<P>
The status of Jerusalem, housing holy sites to Jews, Muslims and
Christians, is the sticking point in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel, which seized the Arab East Jerusalem from Jordan in the
1967 Mideast war and annexed it later, declared the whole city as
its "undivided and eternal capital" while the Palestinians want the
east part as the capital of their future state.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Palestinian Legislative Council Speaker and chief
negotiator Ahmed Qurei (Abu Ala) told the Voice of Palestine radio
that no Israeli-Palestinian deal is possible unless Israel promises
a full withdrawal from East Jerusalem and all the occupied
territories.
</P>
<P>
On peace talks with Syria, Barak said Sunday that he had told
French President Jacques Chirac during a telephone contact Saturday
night that Israel had made a strategic choice for peace with Syria
and believes that an agreement must honor both sides' interests and
rights.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister added that from his point-of-view, the door
is still open to negotiations with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks had been in stalemate since January due
to the two sides failed to bridge their differences over the return
of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Parliamentary Elections Kick off EDS-Updates with more details on the Parliamentary voting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Voters in central and northern
Lebanon began to cast ballots Sunday in the first round of voting
on a new parliament.
</P>
<P>
This is the third parliamentary elections since the end of the
1975-1990 civil war.
</P>
<P>
Over 1.3 million eligible voters, aged above 21, in the
provinces of North Lebanon and Mount Lebanon, the Christian
heartland, will choose 63 legislators out of 286 candidates in
Sunday's voting. They will cast their ballots in more than 300
polling centers amid tight security.
</P>
<P>
The voting is expected to end at 6 p.m. (1500 GMT) and the
initial results would be announced as early as Monday.
</P>
<P>
The other 65 legislators of the 128-seat parliament will be
chosen from the areas of Beirut, the Bekaa Valley and the south
next Monday. South Lebanon, including a strip occupied by Israel
from 1978 till May, will see the first election in 22 years.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry says that 2.75 million Lebanese have
registered to vote in the elections.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese army, in charge of security for the poll, had
mobilized some 10,000 troops since Saturday evening. Some 7,000
paramilitary police patrol at polling stations. Interior Minister
Michel Al-Murr said on Sunday morning that all process of the
voting went in order and no violence incident was reported.
</P>
<P>
Three Christian parties have called for boycott to the polls to
protest against the Syrian presence. Many Lebanese believe that
Syria, which is regarded as the main power broker of Lebanon and
deploys 35,000 troops in the country, has ordained the result
through the influence on the government.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon is one of the few countries in the world whose elections
are run on sectarian lines, with the 128 seats divided equally
among Muslims and Christians and then further sub-divided between
each of the 18 recognized religious sects.
</P>
<P>
According to Lebanese law, the current government will resign
after the formation of the new parliament. The president will
nominate a prime minister who has to be approved by the parliament.
Then the prime minister will forge a new government in a month.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Coast Guards Recover 8 Bodies From Capsized Boat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkish coast guards have
recovered eight bodies from a capsized Turkish boat that sank
Saturday night in the Aegean Sea, Anatolia News Agency reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The boat, setting out from Turkish Bodrum township of Mugla
province in Aegean region to Greek Kos Island, was carrying 32
illegal immigrants as it sank off Bodrum shortly after midnight.
</P>
<P>
The coast guards had rescued six people including the Turkish
skipper, but the other 18 are missing.
</P>
<P>
Turkish and Greek coast guard assisted by a helicopter are still
continuing the search, but rescue efforts were made difficult by
strong winds and rough waters, the agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Bodrum township chief Cumhur Guven Tasbasi said there were 18
Iraqis, five Afghans, eight Iranians and a woman whose nationality
was unknown aboard the ill-fated boat.
</P>
<P>
Three of the six rescued people have been taken to the state
hospital of Bodrum township for treatment.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old skipper, Tevrat Yanik, confessed that he charged
1,000 U.S. dollars each for smuggling them to Kos Island.
</P>
<P>
He said a fighting sparked by a squabble among the illegal
immigrants aboard overturned the boat.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Turkish security forces intercepted 42 foreigners in
Bodrum as they were trying to proceed to Greece illegally. They
were taken into custody for violating Turkish borders and passport
law.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is a commercial and cultural bridge between Europe and
Asia because of its geographical position. Many illegal immigrants
attempt to enter European countries via Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Urges International Community to Do More on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
Sunday called on the international community to exert effective
influence in order to pave the way for substantive negotiations on
the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Clerides made the call at an inauguration ceremony, held in Kato
Pyrgos, in the southwestern Paphos district of the island, for a
bust of two fighters in the battle against British colonial rule in
the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
He said freedom, justice, peace and security must be restored in
Cyprus, which would contribute to regional stability, security and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Cyprus issue, Clerides stressed that the Greek
Cypriot side is determined to carry on working for a settlement on
the island.
</P>
<P>
He said a peaceful resolution of the Cyprus issue needs the
political will of the other side, but there is no indication that
the position of the Turkish Cypriot side is shifting.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island in the wake of an abortive coup
supporting union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Three rounds of U.N.-sponsored proximity talks on Cyprus over
the past 10 months have not produced any tangible results so far.
There was no substantive negotiation as the Turkish Cypriot side
insists on recognition of the breakaway state in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
So far the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides outlined and
clarified their positions to the U.N. during the proximity talks.
</P>
<P>
The fourth round of talks are scheduled to start on September 12
in New York.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said that this time the world community should exert
effective influence to open the way towards substantive
negotiations within the framework of U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the Greek government for its "invaluable
contribution" to efforts to solve the Cyprus issue, to help Cyprus
in its European Union accession bid and to enhance Cyprus defense
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Clerides will leave on September 1 for London and then New York,
to attend the U.N. Millennium Summit and participate in the fourth
round of Cyprus talks.

<HEADLINE> Iran Claims Dozens MKO Members Killed and Injured in Border Clash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran claimed on Sunday that its
army had killed and injured dozens of members of the Iraq-based
Iranian military opposition group Mujaheddin Khalq Organization
(MKO) in border clashes on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
No specific figures were given. The state television quoted a
military source as saying that government troops repelled MKO
attacks and forced the rebels flee, leaving behind two Katyusha
launchers and many armaments including grenades and guns.
</P>
<P>
The MKO members had been trying to cross into Iran near the city
of Meymeh in the western border province of Ilam, the unnamed
source said. On the government side, three soldiers were killed
after the rebels fired mortar shells.
</P>
<P>
The MKO, a famous political-military group which fought against
the former shah's regime, was outlawed in 1981 and fled into Iraq
following sharp differences with the clerics brought to power by
the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Labeled by Tehran as a "terrorist group," the group has launched
a slew of attacks inside Iran in recent years, including the
assassination of senior government officials.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Turkmenistan Stress Cooperation in Solving Caspian Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Turkmenistan stressed on
Sunday that littoral states of the Caspian Sea should cooperate to
find a multilateral arrangement for exploiting and using the
resources in the area.
</P>
<P>
Any decision regarding the Caspian issue should be comprehensive
and uniform, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi told Boris
Shikhmyradov, the special envoy of Turkmen president.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi stressed that the five littoral states must find a
legal regime regarding the Caspian resources through cooperation
and coordination and avoid any unilateral actions, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Shikhmyradov also rejected unilateral actions, saying any move
regarding the Caspian has to be multilateral, transparent,
equitable and decisive.
</P>
<P>
The five littoral states of the Caspian Sea are Iran, Russia,
Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. The five have long called
for a legal regime to govern the Caspian, which has high potentials
in oil and gas reserves, navigation and fishery.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1921 and 1940 agreements between Iran and the
former Soviet Union, the land-locked sea could be exploited
jointly. But after the Soviet Union broke up, newly independent
republics -- Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan -- are seeking
a new legal status on the sea.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Iran said it was ready to accept a complete
division of the Caspian among its five littoral states, with Iran
having a 20-percent share. But the five countries still need
further negotiations to reach a final consensus on the issue.
</P>
<P>
At Sunday's meeting, Kharrazi and Shikhmyradov also expressed
their common concern over the continuing conflict in Afghanistan,
calling for all necessary measures to end the bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
The Turkmen official arrived here Sunday. He is also to visit
Afghanistan and Pakistan, IRNA said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Population Reaches 65 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's population reached 65.205
million at the start of 2000, indicating a growth rate of 2.02
percent in 1999, according to census results announced on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
One baby was born every 24.4 seconds on average during the past
three years in the country, Director of Egypt's Central Agency of
Public Mobilization and Statistics Ihab Elawi told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
He said the growth rate in 1999 was lower than that in the
previous year, when it stood at 2.09 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government wants to lower the population growth rate to
below 2 percent, but efforts to control the birth rate were
neutralized by the fact that death rates were also falling.
</P>
<P>
The authorities' efforts have also been hindered by a widespread
belief that contraception is not accepted by the Muslim religion.
</P>
<P>
Elawi also said the census showed 1.9 million Egyptians, or 2.9
percent of the population, are working abroad, mainly in the Gulf
states.
</P>
<P>
It is forecast that the population could reach 123 million by
2029. More than half the population is concentrated in 5 percent of
the land space in this largely desert country.

CAIRO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- On the heels of the World Bank, the Japan Bank for
International Cooperation (JBIC) has also suspended a loan of
nearly 750 million U.S. dollars, which is to be extended to Turkey
on financial adjustment, reported Anatolia News Agency on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Sources said JBIC was waiting for the arrangement of
privatization in public banks before it would release the loan in
line with the policy of the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank announced earlier this month that it would
release the 750-million-dollar loan on financial sector adjustment
following the finalization of the privatization plan on public
banks. It wants the legal arrangements for privatizing public banks
to be presented as a package.
</P>
<P>
JBIC officials paid a fact-finding visit to Turkey in June and
got information on the country's financial sector.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran will build a steel plant for Kuwait in line with
its economic policy of cooperating with neighboring countries in
industrial projects, said Minister of Mines and Metals Eshaq
Jahangiri on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The steel project, with the cooperation of Kuwait, will be the
first Iranian-built industrial plant abroad, Jahangiri was quoted
by the Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He added that the steel complex will come on stream by the end
of the next Iranian year which starts March 21, 2001.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The exports value of fresh fruits and vegetables from
the Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP) region in the first seven
months of 2000 rose to 15 million U.S. dollars, up by 30.9 percent
from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
In the same period of last year, the region, which consists
eight provinces, exported 11 million dollars of fresh fruits and
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Southeastern Anatolia Exporters' Union told
reporters on Sunday that the majority of the goods had gone to the
Middle East and European Union countries.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran's National Petrochemical Company (NPC) is seeking
to increase its ethylene production to 5 million tons a year,
Deputy Oil Minister for Petrochemical Affairs Mohammad Reza
Nematzadeh said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that domestic ethylene production would reach
3.5 to 4 million tons a year by the end of the third five-year
economic development plan (2000-2005). The figure will finally
reach 5 million tons given the potential of the petrochemical
industry, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran's total petrochemical output would rise to 38
million tons by the end of the third plan in light of a three-
phased project, launched by the NPC since 1997 to develop the
country's petrochemical industry.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Not to Compromise Arab Identity in Working for Peace: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said on Sunday that Cairo will not compromise its Arab and
Islamic identity in working for peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the remark while speaking to reporters about the
coming visit to Egypt by U.S. President Bill Clinton on Tuesday. He
said Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Clinton would brief each
other on their ideas on how to narrow gaps between the Palestinians
and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Egypt would not lose sight of Arab and Islamic concerns, such as
the status of Jerusalem, the minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is an Arab and Islamic state and does not belong to any
other region, Moussa said, adding that it cannot detach itself from
the reality in which it lives.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has an important role to play for peace and stability and
security in the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
Moussa and Mubarak have repeatedly said Egypt will not pressure
the Palestinians to accept any proposals for peace with Israel that
do not meet the Palestinian people's demands.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Clinton's visit was "very important" because it will
decide, or help decide, a number of matters related to the Mideast
peace process.
</P>
<P>
He did not rule out the possibility that a Palestinian-Israeli
peace agreement could be reached before the end of the year. But he
underlined that this depends on the appreciation of all the
parties, especially Israel, for the benefits peace could bring in
terms of security, regional integration and end of conflict.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is due in Egypt early Tuesday for a brief stopover on
his way home from visits to Nigeria and Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Syrian FM Leaves for Paris to Revive Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk
Shareh left here on Sunday for Paris for talks with French
officials on the Middle East peace process in the wake of last
month's failed Camp David peace summit.
</P>
<P>
Shareh will deliver a message from Syrian President Bashar al-
Assad to his French counterpart Jacques Chirac on the situation in
the Middle East and the latest developments of the regional peace
process as well as the Syrian-French ties.
</P>
<P>
France is currently holding the rotating presidency of the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
Shareh will also hold talks with French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine on the peace talks on the Syrian and Palestinian tracks,
and ways of reviving the stalled Syrian-Israeli peace talks in the
light of recent contacts between U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, Shareh and some other Arab foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Administration has been making intensive contacts with
Syria to probe the possibility of settling the dispute over a strip
of the eastern shore of Sea of Galilee between Syria and Israel,
said diplomatic sources.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has proposed to internationalize the area, Syria
rejects a resumption of talks with Israel without an Israeli pledge
to withdraw to the borders before the 1967 Middle East war,
including the strip of shore of the lake.
</P>
<P>
During a recent contact with Shareh, Albright expressed interest
in resuming the Syrian-Israeli peace talks. There is a chance to
revive the talks during the coming two months, she said.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers agreed to meet on the sidelines of the
U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York next month.
</P>
<P>
Shareh is expected to leave for Morocco after the visit to
attend a meeting of the Jerusalem Committee of the Organization of
the Islamic Conference.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, to be held on Tuesday, will be chaired by Moroccan
King Mohammed VI with a view to adopting a unified Arab position on

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Celebrate OPEC Founding Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraq will hold celebrations next
month to mark the 40th anniversary of the founding of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the official
Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A source from the Iraqi oil ministry said that Iraq has been
preparing "magnificent" ceremony for the event. OPEC was
established in the Iraqi capital Baghdad on September 14, 1960.
</P>
<P>
The celebrations will start from September 11 and last for about
two weeks to greet the forthcoming OPEC summit meeting to be held
in the Venezuelan capital Caracas, the source said. Iraq will also
participate in the celebrations in Caracas for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
On that occasion, Iraq will present folklore and fashion shows,
music, an exhibition of antiques and books concerning Iraq's
religion and scenic spots.
</P>
<P>
A number of officials from the ministries of foreign affairs,
finance, cultural and information will be present at the Caracas
celebrations, said the source.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral relations between Iraq and Venezuela have
witnessed a big step forward after Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
visited the country on August 10, the first such visit by a head of
state since the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Chavez toured Iraq and other nine members of OPEC to invite all
OPEC members to attend the summit meeting in Caracas next month.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela and Iraq are both sponsor nations of OPEC. On
September 10, 1960, representatives from Iraq, Venezuela, Iran,
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait held a meeting in Baghdad to safeguard the
oil prices. Four days later, they announced the founding of the
world's biggest oil cartel.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Military Operation in Palestinian Village Condemned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official Sunday
denounced the Israeli military operation in a West Bank village
Saturday night as a "heinous act."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) condemned the operation
which took place at a time when negotiations were being held
between the Palestinians and Israel, said Speaker of the
Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) Ahmed Qurei (also known as
Abu Ala).
</P>
<P>
Three Israeli soldiers were killed in a shootout when hundreds
of Israeli soldiers stormed the Palestinian village of Assira
Ashamalieh near Nablus, which is believed to be one of the
strongholds of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement, or
Hamas.
</P>
<P>
During the clashes, Mahmoud Abu Hanoud, the number one fugitive
on Israel's most-wanted list, was also wounded. But he escaped from
the house besieged by the IDF in Nablus and gave himself up to the
Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli authorities said that the three soldiers "
were killed by friendly fire" and investigations are still
underway.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a statement by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
that the Israeli General Security Services might ask the PNA to
hand over Hanoud, West Bank Preventive Security Commander Gebril
al-Ragoub said the Palestinian side would never yield to Israel's
pressure.
</P>
<P>
He added that Israel had to coordinate with the Palestinian
security forces before carrying out its military operation in the
village, which is under Palestinian civilian administration but
under Israeli security control.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by three helicopters, the IDF besieged the village
at midnight in a bid to arrest Hanoud, who was accused of being
behind two anti-Israeli suicide bombings in Jerusalem in 1997,
killing and injuring 21 Israelis. The IDF early Sunday morning blew
up a house where the clash with Hamas militants took place.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Rejects Israeli Sovereignty over Jerusalem: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Ali Abu Ragheb said
here Sunday that Jordan firmly rejects any form of Israeli
sovereignty over Jerusalem, and the kingdom's interests must be
protected in the final status peace talks between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Ragheb told a press conference that Jordan has never presented
any different suggestions on the future status of Jerusalem, and it
is persistent in its support for the establishment of a Palestinian
state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war
and later annexed it, and declared Jerusalem as its eternal and
indivisible capital, which is not recognized internationally.
</P>
<P>
The future of the holy city is one of the thorniest issues in
the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks which also focused on the
return of Palestinian refugees, water, borders and security
arrangements between Israel and a future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Ragheb said Jordan is, and will continue to be, one of the basic
pillars of peace process in the region, but no peace solutions can
ignore Jordan's interests, particularly on the Palestinian refugees
issue.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is hosting some 1.5 million Palestinian refugees, most of
whom had been given Jordanian citizenship. But the government said
it does not mean they had given up their rights to return home or
stay in Jordan while asking for compensations from parties
concerned.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has direct interest in the ongoing final status
negotiations between the Palestinians and Israel, and has been
well-informed about what is going on concerning the refugee issue,
Ragheb said.
</P>
<P>
Israel, the Palestinians, and the United States had confirmed to
Jordan that it would be involved in the interpretation of the
status of Palestinian refugees, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said Jordan's position on the refugee issue is based on the
U.N. Security Council Resolution 194, which stipulates the right of
return and compensation, and the kingdom has relayed this position
in written forms to Palestinian and Israeli negotiators.
</P>
<P>
The U.N., the U.S. and the European Union have also been
informed of the Jordanian stand, he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the U.S. role as a major broker in the peace
process, Ragheb said "We have good relations with America
particularly on the political and economic levels, and we believe
that the U.S. is a partner to Jordan in all areas."
</P>
<P>
Washington takes Jordan, which signed a peace treaty with Israel
in 1994, as an ally in the Arab world, and provided some 300
million U.S. dollars in various economic and military aid packages
to the kingdom in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Records 6.9 Percent GDP Growth in First Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka recorded a 6.9 percent
growth rate in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) terms during the first
half of this year due to buoyant exports, according to provisional
estimates.
</P>
<P>
"The annual growth rate appears to be somewhat higher than the
original estimate of 5.5 percent of the Central Bank. It is now
estimated to be in the region of six percent," a highly placed
Central Bank source was quoted as saying by the Sunday Observer
here.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka experienced a 4.3 percent GDP growth rate in 1999.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of this year, overall export earnings
recorded 2,464 million dollars, an increase of 19.67 percent over
the corresponding period last year, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
It said earnings from garment exports increased by 24 percent
to 1.322 billion dollars, which was attributed to the robust
economic growth of the United States which is the main buyer of
Sri Lanka's garments.
</P>
<P>
As a result of a boom in oil prices, Sri Lanka's black tea
prices experienced an upward trend, due to increased demand from
the Russian and Middle Eastern markets. Earnings from tea exports
appreciated from 297 million dollars to 327 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, Sri Lanka's import bill for the first half of this
year increased by nearly 1 billion dollars compared with last year
to 3.603 billion dollars, contributing to a trade deficit of 1.139
billion dollars, as against 549 million dollars last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Abu Sayyaf Sunday afternoon
released five foreign hostages including four seized from Malaysia
and kept them captive for more than four months in its jungle lair
in the southern Philippine island of Jolo.
</P>
<P>
The freed four women and one man arrived by helicopter at the
Edwin Andrews air base in Zamboanga, a port city near Jolo, at
around 6 p.m., under the escort of Philippine government chief
negotiator Robert Aventajado and Libyan envoy Rajab Azzarouq, the
ABS-CBN TV station reported.
</P>
<P>
They were met at the air base by ambassadors or envoys of their
countries and their relatives who had been waiting there in
anxious anticipation of their arrival.
</P>
<P>
Expectations ran high earlier in the day that the Abu Sayyaf
would free six, or half of the 12 foreign hostages in its hands.
The sixth hostage expected to be released is a Finnish national.
</P>
<P>
The five released Sunday include one French woman, one Lebanese-
French woman, one South African woman and one German man who were
among the original group of 21 hostages kidnapped by the Abu
Sayyaf from Malaysia's resort island of Sipadan on April 23.
</P>
<P>
And the fifth is a French woman who was one of the three
members of a French TV crew seized in Jolo last month while
covering the hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
They will be brought to the central city of Cebu and a
chartered Libyan plane, which has been waiting there since
Saturday last week,will then fly them to the Libyan capital of
Tripoli, where they will be met by their relatives and
representatives of their countries.
</P>
<P>
It has been widely reported that Libya had agreed to pay 1
million U.S. dollars each for the 12 foreign hostages in addition
to an earlier offer of 25 million dollars in ransom to the Abu
Sayyaf for the release of its hostages. But both Tripoli and
Manila have denied that they paid any ransoms. Libya said its
funds were for livelihood projects for Muslim areas in Mindanao,
the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf is still holding the remaining six hostages of
the Sipadan group -- two Finns, one German, one French, one South
African and one Filipino.
</P>
<P>
It is also keeping captive two members of the French TV crew
and 12 local Christian evangelists who paid their way into the
rebel lair to pray for the hostages last month.

</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf reportedly promised Saturday to free six foreign
hostages Sunday after getting assurance from a government emissary
that two of its members who were arrested in Zamboanga Thursday
were released on bail.
</P>
<P>
The rebel group threatened Friday to kill two captives and not
to release any hostage unless police release the two men, who were
arrested when they were trying to exchange 240,000 U.S. dollars
worth of alleged ransom money into pesos at a bank in Zamboanga.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf had earlier released nine Malaysians, one German
woman and one Filipino woman of the Sipadan group and one German
and two Filipino journalists who were seized in Jolo.
</P>
<P>
The group has amassed at least 5.5 million dollars in ransoms
paid for the release of their captives, according to military
officials. But the governments of the Philippines and related
countries have repeatedly stated that they had paid no ransom for
the release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada expressed happiness over
the release of the five foreign hostages Sunday, and he hopes that
the remaining seven foreigners would be freed next week.
</P>
<P>
Estrada reiterated Friday that the safety of the hostages
remains his administration's top priority, saying that is why "it
is taking us a long time to work for their release."
</P>
<P>
He made the statement in response to a call by three European
leaders on the Philippine government not to use force to end the
hostage crisis, which has entered its fifth month.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Estrada dated August 22, which was made public
Friday, Finnish President Tarja Halonen, French President Jacques
Chirac and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said, "The safety
of the hostages may not be undermined by any use of force."
</P>
<P>
They also expressed concern over delays in the release of their
nationals held hostage by the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday last week, the rebels reneged on an agreement with
government negotiators to release all its hostages in one go,
alleging that the military was preparing an offensive against them.

About 100 people were working at the site when the roof fell in,
Deputy Commissioner of Police in Chittagong Aminul Islam told
Xinhua over phone.
</P>
<P>
"Eight bodies have been retrieved from the debris and 13
workers have been sent to hospital," he said, adding that more
people could be trapped under the debris.
</P>
<P>
It has become a familiar story that scores of Bangladeshi
garment workers, mainly female, die in fires annually and many
more are fatally injured.
</P>
<P>
There are around 2,500 garment factories in the country which
employ 1.4 million workers, 90 percent of whom are women.
</P>
<P>
Sources said safety provisions in almost all the factories are
absent and faulty. Fire incidents and machine and electrical
hazards are rampant in the garment units.
</P>
<P>
Most of the fired in garment factories occur due to short
circuits, fire brigade officials said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Singapore to Have More Interaction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 27 (Xinhua) -- There will be more
interaction especially between the younger leaders of Malaysia and
Singapore,Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said the ruling party UMNO (United Malays National
Organization)Youth leader Hishammuddin Hussein would lead a
delegation to meet Singapore's ruling party youth leaders soon.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian MPs will be going to Singapore and there will be a
lot of interaction and movements from both sides,he told reporters
after a golf session with his Singapore counterpart,S. Jayakumar,
here.
</P>
<P>
The visit by the Malaysian MPs to Singapore is a very positive
indication which augurs well for better ties between the two
neighbors after several years of strained relationships, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is a sense of openness and frankness and a very clear
intention and desire to develop our future relationship by not
looking at the past but to move forward," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said both countries should take advantage of the "mood"
created by the recent visit of Singapore's Senior Minister Lee
Kuan Yew who expressed the need for improved bilateral ties and
solving all outstanding issues such as a new water supply
agreement, development of Malayan railways land in Singapore and
the Malaysian customs checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
Agreeing to Syed Hamid's views, Jayakumar said improvement in
bilateral relations required more closer interaction not only at
the political level but also in other areas such as between civil
servants and the private sectors of the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Manila Softens Stance on Hostage Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada confirmed Sunday afternoon that he is softening the
government's "all or nothing" stance on the Sulu hostage crisis
following the release of five foreign hostages by the Abu Sayyaf
earlier on the day.
</P>
<P>
Estrada told reporters that appeals from European envoys to
ease the government position in dealing with the Abu Sayyaf rebels
prompted this decision.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf Sunday afternoon set free five foreign hostages,
including four women, from its jungle lair in the Jolo island in
the southern province of Sulu.
</P>
<P>
The five comprise four of the original group of 21 hostages
kidnapped by the Abu Sayyaf from Malaysia's resort island of
Sipadan on April 23 and one journalist abducted in Jolo last month
while covering the hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday last week, the Abu Sayyaf rebels reneged on an
agreement to release all of its hostages in one go, alleging that
the military was preparing an offensive against them. They offered
to free two Europeans, but negotiators rejected the offer in line
with Estrada's "all or nothing policy."
</P>
<P>
The president expressed happiness over Sunday's release of the
five foreign hostages and hoped that the remaining seven
foreigners would be freed in a week's time.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf is still holding the remaining six hostages of
the Sipadan group -- two Finns, one German, one French, one South
African and one Filipino -- and two French journalists and 12
local Christian evangelists seized in Jolo last month.
</P>
<P>
The only male hostage released Sunday, German national Werner
Walert, said he is not entirely happy because not all hostages
were freed. His son Marc remains with the Abu Sayyaf rebels.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada explained that the hostage crisis dragged on
because his administration wants to ensure the welfare of the
hostages.
</P>
<P>
The president reiterated Friday that the safety of the hostages
remains his administration's top priority, saying that is why "it
is taking us a long time to work for their release."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Finnish President Tarja Halonen, French President
Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Erhard Schroeder wrote a
letter to Estrada cautioning against using force to end the
hostage crisis,which has entered its fifth month.

<P>
MANILA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Ten civilians were killed Sunday
morning by suspected members of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front
in a province in the southern island of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
An undetermined number of armed men fired upon a passenger
jeepney loaded with commuters at a place in Carmen town, North
Cotabato Province at around 6 a.m., killing nine people on the
spot, the local ABS-CBN TV station reported.
</P>
<P>
Another one died upon arrival at a nearby hospital, it added.
</P>
<P>
Government forces in the area are conducting pursuit operations
against the perpetrators suspected to be MILF members, it said.
</P>
<P>
On August 4, some 100 suspected MILF rebels stopped three
passing vehicles in Carmen and shot dead 16 people, mostly
children.
</P>
<P>
The secessionist group has been blamed for a series of
terrorist acts in the country by the government after the military

</P>
<P>
Top MILF leader Hashim Salamat called for a jihad, or holy war
after the fall of Camp Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
The MILF has been fighting for more than 20 years for an

<HEADLINE> Singaporeans Urged to Pursue Lifelong Learning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime
Minister Lee Hsien Loong Sunday urged Singaporeans to pursue
lifelong learning as a survival strategy and continuously upgrade
their skills with an aim to make a difference to their lives in
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"The challenge is not just creating employment or jobs, but
ensuring employability -- equipping our workers with the skills to
do the new jobs which are available, and to adapt to new working
conditions in high growth sectors," Lee said while launching the
2000 Singapore Learning Festival.
</P>
<P>
The festival features 250 learning activities with the
objectives of raising public awareness of and interest in lifelong
learning, promoting a national approach to this task and
showcasing the diversity of available learning opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Lee noted that restructuring in business everywhere forces
workers to learn and find new jobs or be retrenched and become
structurally unemployed.
</P>
<P>
Underlining the urgency of the task of training and retraining
workers, Lee said, "Unless our workers pick up new skills, they
will lose out even though new job opportunities are being created.
"
</P>
<P>
Currently, only one-third of the existing workforce is skilled
in Singapore and another third is semi-skilled while the rest is
unskilled. In the first half of this year, 44,500 new jobs were
created against 7,800 workers laid off, but the June unemployment
rate stood at 3.5 percent, failing to go down as companies had
difficulties to find skilled workers to fill their vacancies.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister said his government will do all it
can to help workers, citing that the government has used the Skill
Development Fund to support training programs for workers,
collaborated with the National Trades Union Congress to fund the
Skills Redevelopment Programs and set up a 5 billion Singapore
dollars Lifelong Learning Fund, which Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong announced last week to provide significant resources to
support programs for workers.
</P>
<P>
Noting that 57 percent of Singapore's workforce has not engaged
in any training in the last three years, Lee stressed that workers
must understand that training and learning will be continuing
priority throughout their working lives and they need to adopt a
more flexible mindset, accept new work conditions and undergo
retraining for new jobs.
</P>
<P>
He also urged companies to see training and development of
their employees as a strategic investment in their innovation
capacities.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Parties Geared Up for Nominations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- All political parties in Sri
Lanka are geared up to submit their nominations beginning Monday
for the forthcoming elections in the country, a senior election
official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Election Commissioner K. Senanayake said nominations
will be received from Monday until September 4 at 22 district
secretariats islandwide.
</P>
<P>
He said security will be tightened in and around the
secretariats and he asked the politicians not to bring large
crowds when they present their nominations.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's 45 recognized political parties and several
independent groups have indicated that they will contest the 11th
parliamentary general elections to be held on October 10.
</P>
<P>
Some 12 million voters are to cast their votes at more than 10,
000 polling booths to elect 225 representatives to the next
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Elections Department has identified the necessary personnel
of more than 90,000 to man all polling booths and counting centers
and is in the process of making all logistical arrangements for
the polls.
</P>
<P>
Already three people respectively from the ruling People's
Alliance (PA) and the main opposition United National Party (UNP)
and the left-wing People's Liberation Front have been killed in
pre-nominations violence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PA and the UNP have been busy cutting deals with
smaller parties ahead of the nominations on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Five of the eight parliamentarians of the Ceylon Workers
Congress (CWC), a key ally of President Chandrika Kumaratunga's PA
government, defected to the main opposition UNP on Friday. The CWC
split obviously weakened the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
The PA faced another setback Sunday before the nominations when
one of its key allies, Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC), decided
to contest alone under the name of National United Alliance.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the SLMC, Minister M.H.M. Ashraff, is involved in
a battle with a fellow minister belonging to the Sri Lanka Freedom
party, a main constituent party of the PA.
</P>
<P>
However, in a move to consolidate its majority Sinhala-Buddhist
vote base, the PA on Friday entered into alliance with the MEP or
People's United Front, a hard-line Sinhala nationalist party, to
contest the general elections.

<P>
ABUJA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton Sunday reassured Nigerians of his government's
determination to assist in the development of Nigeria's economy,
education and health care.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a reception held in his honor in Ushafa, a village
about 30 kilometers outside the capital Abuja, Clinton said his
visit to Nigeria was to help the country build its ailing economy
and improve its education and health care delivery system to
ensure growth and development.
</P>
<P>
According to Clinton, he and his entourage were in Nigeria to
express the goodwill of Americans to Nigerians for having a new
lease of life in their governance. "With democracy now in Nigeria,
you will surely see development and progress," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also reaffirmed that the U.S. government would support and
assist the democratic government in Nigeria and called on people
to render unalloyed support and defense for democracy and its firm
entrenchment.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who arrived in Abuja on Saturday for a two-day state
visit to the most populous African country, made a trip to Ushafa
Sunday morning to see what a typical Nigerian village looks like.
</P>
<P>
He was bestowed by village chief Alhaji Muhammadu Baba, who
bears the traditional title of "Dan Masanni of Ushafa", which
literally means the most learned person of the village.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Somali National Flag -- Symbol of Somali Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Zhao Yi
</P>
<P>
Djibouti, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Everybody cherishes the
national flag of his motherland because it represents the nation
he belongs to. For the Somalis, however, their national flag,
which is sky-blue color with a white five-pointed star in the
middle, has much more meaning than people in other parts of the
world think.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's inauguration of Somali President Abdiqasim Salad
Hassan in Arta, some 45 kilometers away from the capital of
Djibouti, was in some sense also a ceremony that marked the Somali
national flag's return to its motherland.
</P>
<P>
As part of the inauguration ceremony, Djibouti President Ismael
Omar Guelleh, sponsor and host of the months-long Somali Peace
Conference, presented solemnly the Somali national flag to Salad,
who then transferred it to Somali guards of honor in the same way.
</P>
<P>
"We actually come to Djibouti to get our national flag back to
Somalia," Dahir Gabil Shire, a colonel during the rule of the
deposed Mohamed Sirad Barre, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Dahir is the chief of a 13-member Somali guard of honor at the
ceremony. All these guards were officers in the Sirad regime.
</P>
<P>
"We are very happy and proud to serve for the new government of
Somalia because our motherland is to escape from the civil war
under this government ," said another colonel Ali Noor.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Somali participants of the ceremony were so proud
of their national flag that they put the national symbol where
ever possible -- holding in their hands, hanging on the pillars,
printing on their helmets and draping over their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
That is why the scene of the ceremony, which occupied about one
square kilometer, was described by some participants as a sea of
Somali national flags.
</P>
<P>
In addition to their national flag, the Somali participants
were also bearing in mind constantly their national anthem that
had been sung by the people ever since the country won its
independence from the British rule in 1960.
</P>
<P>
All this shows that the Somalis, who have been here holding a
peace conference since May, are doing their best to resume their
dreamed and idealized Somalia which should be a peaceful and
reconciled country.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Rebels Set Conditions for Hostage Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The West Side Boys, a rebel group
in Sierra Leone, has put forward a number of conditions for the
release of 11 British soldiers abducted by them, said a report
reaching here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A senior Sierra Leonean government official was quoted as
saying in the capital Freetown that the rebels had reportedly
asked for food, medicine and the release of one of their leaders
from the government's prison.
</P>
<P>
The concerned prisoner, known variously as Bomb Blast or
General Papa, had been detained in the central prison in Freetown
for almost two months, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The British soldiers, who had been serving under the British
training team in Sierra Leone, were reportedly taken hostage by
the rebel group on Friday when they were patrolling along the
Freetown-Masiaka highway.
</P>
<P>
Since the abduction, the United Nations mission in Sierra Leone
has been in contact with the rebels in an attempt to secure the
safe release of the soldiers, who are reportedly "in good
condition".
</P>
<P>
It is not yet known whether the Sierra Leonean government would
meet the rebels' demands for the release of the British soldiers.

ABUJA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- U. S. President Bill Clinton
Sunday pledged inflow of American investment and tariff cuts for
Nigerian products at a business forum during his second-day visit
to the West African country.
</P>
<P>
Some categories of products originated from Nigeria will enter
the U.S. market duty free, making the country enjoy the most
favorable trade treatment in the world except some South American
countries, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"The road has been laid by the two governments, but the cars
have to be made by the business sectors," he told the party
attended by VIPs from both Nigerian and American business sectors.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his pledge that the U.S. government would do its
part to help reduce Nigeria's debts, and urged Nigerian
businessmen to make sure that the benefit from the debt relief
will add to the country's economic recovery in the long-run.
</P>
<P>
He also urged Nigerians to take advantage of the information
technology and put more emphasis on education.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived here Saturday morning for a two-day official
visit to the most populous country in Africa.
</P>
<P>
It's the second official visit by an American president, after
Jimmy Carter's 20 years ago. It is also Clinton' s second trip to
Africa after his last one to Ghana and Botswana in 1998.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Clinton held talks with President Olusegun
Obasanjo several times and addressed a joint session of the
National Assembly, the country's top legislature, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton visited a village in the suburbs of the capital Sunday
morning and attended a party on women's development at noon before
attending the business forum late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to leave Nigeria Monday morning for Tanzania to
witness the Burundi peace accord signing ceremony in the northern
town of Arusha.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vows to Support Nigeria's Fight Against HIV/AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton has pledged to provide 10 million U.S. dollars to Nigeria
this year in support of its fight against HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a forum on "United States and Nigeria: Jointing
Forces Against AIDS" in the capital Abuja on Sunday, Clinton said
the grant is three times bigger compared to what the United Sates
provided for the same purpose last year.
</P>
<P>
The United States would also provide 9 million dollars in
support of Nigeria's fight to eradicate polio and 2 million
dollars to help protect Nigerian children from Malaria through the
distribution of bed nets, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Parker Foundation of the United States would also
provide 35 million dollars in grants over the next five years to
improve reproductive health of Nigerian women.
</P>
<P>
The president further promised that the United States would
give Nigeria medicines, especially those that would prevent
transfer of AIDS from pregnant women to their babies. The
infectious diseases could drop in Nigeria and other African
countries just like it had done in America, he said.
</P>
<P>
It was unfortunate that 3 million Nigerians were already living
with AIDS, he said, calling for concerted actions to stop the
spread of the deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
"AIDS can rob a country of its future. I know you will not let
that happen to Nigeria," Clinton said, noting that the fight
against AIDS was not that of Nigeria alone but that of Africa,
America and the entire world.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived in Abuja on Saturday with a 1,000-strong
delegation for a two-day state visit to the most populous African
country.

ABUJA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton Sunday called on the Nigerian business community to
embrace economic reforms and privatization, describing them as the
key to development.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a business forum under the theme "Investing in
Nigeria's Future" in the capital Abuja, Clinton said Nigeria needs
to improve access to information technology in order to take
advantage of the benefits of the explosion in technology.
</P>

Nigeria needs to increase the number of its citizens having
access to the Internet to enable the country to take advantage of
the "collapse of time and distance" inherent in Internet
technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said one of the central themes of his visit to Nigeria is to
help the country reduce its foreign debt burden, which is
estimated at about 30 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Describing the United States and Nigeria as being in the same
boat, Clinton said "we are all in the same boat, so let us sail."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, arrived in Abuja on Saturday with a 1,000-strong
delegation for a two-day state visit to the most populous African
country, is scheduled to leave for Arusha, Tanzania on Monday to
witness the signing of a Burundi peace deal brokered by former

LONDON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Britain would offer 80 million
pounds (about 118 million U.S. dollars) to help the former Soviet
Union deal with nuclear safety issues, a foreign office official
said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Cold War had left Russia with large stocks of weapons
grade nuclear materials which need to be safely stored, he said,
noting that a further 12 million pounds (about 18 million dollars)
was being allocated to help deal with chemical and biological
weapons stocks and facilities.
</P>

"Nuclear hazards do not recognize international boundaries.
The countries of the former Soviet Union face enormous nuclear
problems that affect the lives of us all and these problems need
to be urgently addressed by the whole international community,"
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"This new ... money will almost triple existing spending and
widen the scope of the support that we are able to give," Cook
said.

Britain first announced a package of assistance to the former
Soviet Union countries when Cook was visiting Murmansk last year.

<HEADLINE> Three Elevators Fall at TV Tower in Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Three elevators in the Moscow
Ostankino TV tower, where fire broke out on Sunday afternoon, came
loose and fell at about 7.30 p.m. local time (17:30 GMT). The fate
of those on board was not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers are trying to pry open the fallen elevators' doors,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
However, the Itar-Tass news agency said that four people,
including three firemen and one female operator, were announced
missing.
</P>
<P>
The fallen elevators ignited a fire on the ground floor, Tass
said.
</P>
<P>
About 100 fire engines were working at the scene, trying to
contain the fire at the world's second tallest building, which has
knocked the country's major national television programs off the
air.
</P>
<P>
Many of the paging services, mobile communications, and radio
broadcast were also off the air in Moscow in the aftermath of the
fire.
</P>
<P>
The fire was allegedly caused by a short circuit at a
transmitter of a paging company. Many paging services have been
suspended.
</P>
<P>
The Ostankino TV and BC center, inaugurated in November 1967,
is the second tallest freestanding building in the world, just
after the one in Toronto, Canada.
</P>
<P>
Weighing more than 55,000 tons, the structure is 540 meters
tall. Visitors can reach the observation deck at 337 meters in 58
seconds by the elevator.
</P>
<P>
There are three dining rooms below the observation deck.

<HEADLINE> Nine Out of Ten Experts Complain of Tax bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- British tax experts are calling
on the government to launch an inquiry into the problems plaguing
the Inland Revenue and its self-assessment system.
</P>
<P>
A survey of 770 accountants showed that instances of incorrect
bills and wrong fines increased by up to 24 percent in June,
compared with the findings of a survey in February.
</P>
<P>
Almost nine out of the ten accountants, which carried out the
survey, said they had dealt with clients who had incorrectly been
accused of late filing of returns.
</P>
<P>
Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of taxation at the Association of
Chartered Certified Accountants, said that the problems stemmed
from poor management and chronic understaffing at the revenue
since the self-assessment system began three years ago.
</P>
<P>
He said: "There have been problems every year since self-
assessment was introduced but this year has been an extreme fiasco
because of the revenue's computer problems."
</P>
<P>
The survey found the greatest complaint was that revenue staff
did not receive sufficient training or support. Almost 90 percent
of those surveyed had to spend extra time on self-assessment forms
because of revenue failures or errors.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A fire that broke out Sunday
afternoon at the local Ostankino TV power is spreading to the
lower sections of the world's second tallest freestanding
structure amid reports of several people missing inside a jammed
elevator.
</P>
<P>
The fire, which broke out at a height of 475 meters, have
spread to the height of 280 meters and is moving to lower levels,
the Interfax news agency reported, quoting city fire brigade
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Almost all television programs and many radio broadcasts have
been knocked off the air. Mobile communications and paging
services were also affected.
</P>
<P>
To fill the information void created by the fire, the Itar-Tass
news agency started to provide what it described as open access to
all its information from its web site.
</P>
<P>
President Vladimir Putin summoned Minister of Communications
Leonid Reiman to the Kremlin and discussed the possibility of
using reserve channels to restore the TV broadcasting and secure
uninterrupted work of communication facilities, ambulance service,
the Interior Ministry and other services, the Kremlin press
service said.
</P>
<P>
The fire was allegedly caused by a short circuit at the
transmitter of a paging company, but the authorities have not
ruled out the possibility of sabotage.
</P>
<P>
After the outbreak of the fire, Moscow police received an
anonymous call that said a bomb had planted in the TV tower and
that it would explode shortly, Interfax reported, quoting a source
with law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers are continuing their efforts to free several people
trapped in a fallen elevator that was jammed somewhere in the
tower by emergency blocks.
</P>
<P>
The search team reached a height of 311 meters but could not
proceed further because of high concentration of smoke. The
elevator has not been located, and contact with those trapped
inside has been lost.
</P>
<P>
In addition to those stranded in the fallen elevator, three
people received medical attention because of the fire, Interfax
said.
</P>
<P>
A female TV crewmember was in a shock and two firemen were
slightly poisoned by monoxide fumes.
</P>
<P>
The Ostankino TV and BC center, inaugurated in November 1967,
is the second tallest freestanding building in the world, just

Weighing more than 55,000 tons, the structure is 540 meters
tall. Visitors can reach the observation deck at 337 meters in 58

There are three dining rooms below the observation deck.

<HEADLINE> Syrian FM Pessimistic About Resumption of Peace Process With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk
Shareh said here on Sunday that he is pessimistic about the
perspective of a resumption of peace process between his country
and Israel in near future.
</P>
<P>
In a statement made after a meeting with French President
Jacques Chirac, Shareh said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
missed an important chance to make peace with Syria a few months
ago.
</P>
<P>
He was apparently referring to the failure of the summit
meeting held in March in Geneva between U.S. President Bill
Clinton and the late President Hafez Assad of Syria.
</P>
<P>
"The situation of the Israeli government does not encourage the
realization of peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the problem of Jerusalem, Shareh said that Syria is opposed
to any "dealing" on the question of Arab sovereignty over
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Shareh also expressed his hope that France and European
countries will play an efficient role in pushing forward the
process for a just and global peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
France, which is the current rotating presidency state of the
European Union, has been encouraging both Syria and Israel to
resume their peace process, which has been suspended since January
mainly because of the refusal of Israel to pull out of the Golan
Heights it occupied in 1967.
</P>
<P>
Chirac had a long telephone conversation with Barak on Saturday
on the overall issues concerning the peace process in the Middle
East, said sources at the Elysee presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Interim Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben Ami is due to hold
talks with his French counterpart Hubert Vedrine on Monday in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an Israeli minister recently hinted that Israel
might pull out from Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin said last Wednesday
that Israel should withdraw from the Golan Heights, because it was
a territory occupied by Israel since 1967.

<P>
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told reporters that the

But Pinochet was allowed to return to Chile from Britain in
March after a 17-month legal battle concluded that he could not be

<HEADLINE> UK Seeks to Win Release of Soldiers Captive In Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We have made contact with those who appear to be holding the
men," a defense ministry spokesman said, adding that "discussions
are at a very early stage."
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman acknowledged that Britain was "working
closely with the government of Sierra Leone to try to bring this
to a conclusion."
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Defense said on Saturday that the leader of the
11-man British team, which was captured on Friday while patrolling
near Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, had been in contact
and said all were "being fed and well-treated."
</P>
<P>
"We have made contact with those who appear to be holding" the
men, a Defense Ministry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Reports here quoted a British force spokesman in Freetown as
saying that "efforts are still going on to secure their safe
release. Negotiations are going on."
</P>
<P>
Earlier in London, Defense Minister John Spellar said he was
quite optimistic about the release of the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
"Together with the Sierra Leonean government we will be working
very hard to resolve this," Spellar said.
</P>
<P>
The British troops were reportedly stationed at a base about
40 kilometers east of Freetown, where British instructors are
training Sierra Leonean army recruits. They were accompanied by a
government soldier, who was acting as their guide and was also
believed to have been captured.
</P>
<P>
Since Sierra Leone's civil war began in 1991, the rebels have
killed tens of thousands of people in an attempt to gain control
of the government and the country's diamond-mining regions.
</P>
<P>
Britain sent 1,000 soldiers to Freetown in May when the rebels
re-started the conflict, seizing 500 United Nations peacekeepers
and advancing towards the capital. Their presence was thought to
have done much to stabilize the situation in Sierra Leone, a
former British colony.
</P>
<P>
When the British forces withdrew in mid-June, they left behind
about 400 soldiers to train Sierra Leone army recruits.
</P>
<P>
Britain has also donated arms and equipment and sent military
advisers to Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Neighboring Countries Show Concerns About Plan Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The neighboring countries of
Colombia have recently expressed worries about the negative
impacts of Plan Colombia, fearing it could endanger the security
situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Plan Colombia, hailed by Colombia as "a plan for peace," is a
massive anti-drug operation with investments of 7.5 billion U.S.
dollars, to which the United States will contribute 1.3 billion
dollars, most of it in military assistance.
</P>
<P>
Colombian Foreign Minister Guillermo Fernandez de Soto on
August 24 reaffirmed that Plan Colombia "is a plan of the
Colombians for the Colombians."
</P>
<P>
But Colombia's neighbors fear that the drug war could push the
fighting over their borders, causing an exodus of refugees and
endangering their national security.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel recently showed
his worries about a massive displacement of Colombians, drug
traffickers and guerrillas toward its territory as a consequence
of the implementation of the military part of the plan.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori on Friday made a strong
criticism of the plan, saying "the regional security and that of
the Andean Community is in peril before a three-billion-dollar
military project that Colombia plans to implement along the next
two years."
</P>
<P>
Brazil and Ecuador echoed the concerns of Venezuela and Peru
about the negative effects of Plan Colombia. Ecuador and Venezuela
are making efforts to prevent the entry of Colombian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Plan Colombia and the U.S. aid to Colombia will be among the
main topics at the coming South American Summit scheduled for
August 31-September 1 in Brasilia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States on Friday tried to reassure wary
Latin American nations about its growing military involvement in
Colombia, saying that it will not blow up into a major war that
could spill over into their territories.
</P>
<P>
The Latin American countries' skepticism about the U.S. aid
plan was based on a misunderstanding of its limited nature, said
Thomas Pickering, U.S. undersecretary of state for political
affairs.
</P>
<P>
The United States will pour the 1.3 billion dollars in aid into
Colombia over the next two years, mostly in military backing for a
drive against drug traffickers and armed rebels protecting cocaine
and heroin production in the South American country.
</P>
<P>
Critics say the plan could drag the United States into a
Vietnam-like war in Latin America.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Religious Leaders Conclude Visit to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A delegation consisting of
seven top leaders of Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Catholicism and
Christianity in China has concluded a friendly and goodwill visit
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
During their stay in Los Angeles and Washington, the Chinese
religious leaders met their American counterparts, scholars and
overseas Chinese, many of whom acknowledged that Chinese citizens
enjoy true religious freedom and believed that the visit helped
enhance Americans' understanding of the religious freedom in China.
</P>
<P>
The visit also cleared some misunderstanding and laid a new
foundation for increased contact and cooperation between Chinese
and U.S. religious circles.
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Fu Tieshan, head of the delegation and chairman
of China Catholicism Association, told a forum that freedom of
religion in China is protected by the Constitution and religions
in China are entering a "golden age."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Falun Gong cult is misleading and cheating
people, violating human rights and jeopardizing society.
</P>
<P>
Chinese religious societies firmly support the government's
decision to ban the cult, Buddhist Master Sheng Hui said, adding
that the religious circles had begun to boycott and reject Falun
Gong as early as in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The cult is directly responsible for the death of more than 1,
600 people and harm people in the same way as drugs do, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Dalai Lama, the delegation members said the Dalai Lama
has been engaging in activities designed to split China, which
will bring calamity to religions, Tibet and the entire country,
therefore his presence at the Millennium World Peace Summit runs
counter to the peace theme of the meeting.

WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese photograph
exhibition opened here Saturday at the Kennedy Center, creating an
atmosphere of Chinese culture in one of the most prestigious arts
centers in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The show, which will be on until September 17, is one of the
two exhibitions of the Chinese culture exchange tour in the United
States, with nearly 100 photographic works on display.
</P>
<P>
Some of the pictures by Chinese professional and amateur
photographers, such as "Karst landscape" and "The water-splashing
festival of the Dai people," depict the nature in its many shapes
and hues as well as the lifestyles and customs of the Chinese
people.
</P>
<P>
Some reflect the spirit of the Chinese people dedicated to the
modernization drive while others, for instance, "Street scene in
Beijing," record great changes that have taken place in China.
</P>
<P>
Appreciating the pictures, American journalist Bill Jones said
that such exhibition is important for helping Americans to
understand China.
</P>
<P>
"Many Americans have never been abroad," said Jones. "And they
got to know China mainly from America's strong media, whose
reporting could be partial. I think the exhibition can tell them
something true about China."
</P>
<P>
Jones said that he believed some Americans might think of
visiting China after seeing the photographic works.
</P>
<P>
The culture tour, which started on August 24 with a traditional
Chinese concert in U.N. Assembly Hall, will conclude on September
17 with a folk dance performance in Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Moscow TV Tower Fire Spreads, Nobody Hurt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A fire that broke out earlier
Sunday at the world's second tallest TV tower in Moscow is
spreading, but nobody was hurt.
</P>
<P>
As a result, most television programs and radio broadcast have
been knocked off the air in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
All people have been evacuated from the tower and authorities
are warning about possible malfunctions in communications at the
frequencies used by medical services and the police.
</P>
<P>
The fire was allegedly caused by a short circuit at a
transmitter of a paging company. Many paging services have been
suspended.
</P>
<P>
The Ostankino TV and BC center, inaugurated in November 1967,
is the second tallest freestanding building in the world, just
after the one in Toronto, Canada.
</P>
<P>
Weighing more than 55,000 tons, the structure is 540 meters
tall. Visitors can reach the observation deck at 337 meters in 58
seconds by the elevator.
</P>
<P>
There are three dining rooms below the observation deck.

<HEADLINE> Liezel Horn listed for Women's Doubles Tennis in Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The South African Tennis
Association announced on Saturday that Liezel Horn will replace
injured Mariaan de Swardt to team up with South African ace Amanda
Coetzer for the women's doubles tennis tournament in the Sydney
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"I am really excited about representing South Africa in the
upcoming Olympics. It is a great honour," said Horn, who was
born in South Africa's port city of Durban and has married to her
U.S. coach Tony Huber.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on her and Coetzer's chances in Sydney, she said: "I
think we will do just fine. We speak the same language and our
games will complement each other, Amanda being more of a baseline
player and me the aggressive person at the net."
</P>
<P>
"Although we have yet to play together on the tour, there is no
better time to start than at the Olympics," Horn added.
</P>
<P>
However, she also reckoned that the U.S. pairing of Venus and
Serena Williams will be the team to beat for the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Horn, a doulbes quarter-finalist at this year's French Open as
well as a semi-finalst and quarter-finalist respectively at the
1999 Wimbledon and U.S. Open, was once ranked as high as 131st in
the world singles rankings and reached a year ago a career-high
world doubles ranking of No 32.
</P>
<P>
Looking to the future, Horn said: "If everything goes well with
my career, I definitely hope to represent South Africa for a long
time to come. But right now I am focusing on the present."

<HEADLINE> Comets Win Fourth Straight WNBA Title in Overtime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Cynthia Cooper paced three-
time defending champions Houston Comets to a 79-73 overtime
victory, winning for herself fourth straight championships MVP
award and a fourth straight WNBA title for the team in Houston
Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Cooper scored 25 points in her final game, including a three-
pointer that forced the overtime against the New York Liberty.
She helped the Comets top the Liberty in the finals for the third
time. New York also was the victim in 1997 and last season.
</P>
<P>
Houston became the first professional basketball team in the
United States to win four straight titles since NBA's Boston
Celtics captured eight in a row from 1959-66. The Comets roared
through the postseason at 6-0 and remain the WNBA's only champions.
</P>
<P>
Cooper scored nine of her team's final 18 points and nailed a 3-
pointer with 21 seconds left in regulation to forge a 64-64 tie.
The Liberty had grabbed a three-point lead with 32 seconds to play
on a lay-up by Tari Phillips.
</P>
<P>
New York had a chance to steal Game Two, as it did last season
on Teresa Weatherspoon's stunning backcourt shot. Veteran forward
Sue Wicks drove the baseline and missed a lay-up, with Cooper
grabbing the rebound as time expired.
</P>
<P>
Cooper began her dramatics in the extra session when she hit a
tough lay-up with 2:34 left for a 69-67 cushion. But the Liberty
responded as Wicks, who was 1-for-5 from 3-point range all season,
connected from beyond the arc with 2:14 left for a one-point lead.
</P>
<P>
Cooper nailed two free throws with 1:41 to play and, after
Vickie Johnson missed a jumper for the Liberty, the 37-year-old
superstar hit a runner with 53 seconds remaining for a 73-70 bulge.
</P>
<P>
Tina Thompson made two from the line with 27 seconds left and
former Liberty Coquese Washington followed suit 10 seconds later
for a 77-70 advantage. At the
final buzzer, Cooper jumped into Thompson's arms and later was
lifted in exultation by teammates.
</P>
<P>
Sheryl Swoopes scored a playoff career-high 31 points and
Thompson added 11 for the Comets, who outscored the Liberty, 15-9,
in overtime.
</P>
<P>
Phillips finished with 20 points for New York but fouled out
with 3:57 left in overtime. Tamika Whitmore added 15 points and
Crystal Robinson chipped in 13 off the bench.
</P>
<P>
The loss was especially painful for Weatherspoon, the energetic
point guard who was one of New York's two original players. She
fouled out with 27 seconds left in overtime and draped a towel
over her head while pondering what might have been.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Men's Doubles Set For Big Battle in Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's best hope in the
Olympic badminton event, men's doubles entry Candra Wijaya and
Tony Gunawan, have had near-perfect preparations for the Games, an
offocial of the Badminton Association of Indonesia said.
</P>
<P>
"Candra and Tony are never satisfied with routine preparations.
They have been adding extra training sessions prior to the event.
They are not over-excited or over-confident about winning the gold
medal. They just don't want to waste time in gaining self-
confidence," Christian Hadinata, the training director of the
Association, was quoted by Jakarta Post Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Candra and Tony, the world's top-ranked doubles pair, are
favored to bring home the gold.
</P>
<P>
Tony said earlier if they had to settle for the silver, they
would have failed in their mission.
</P>
<P>
Christian, a former doubles specialist himself, said he was not
worried the players would be burdened by the expectations. "They
have always considered all the possibilities in every move. They
want perfect preparations. They just want to get better and
better in every tournament. You remember how guilty Candra was
when he and Sigit Budiarto lost in the Thomas Cup semifinals
against Denmark. He didn't even want to see the last match," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Christian said the shuttlers inability to accept defeat made
them that much stronger in tournaments.
</P>
<P>
Besides Candra and Tony, Indonesia's Olympic badminton squad
will include world number two of Flandy Limpele and Eng Hian and
world number five and 1996 gold medalists Ricky Subagja and Rexy
Mainaky.
</P>
<P>
"Both Flandy and Didi (Eng Hian's nickname) have changed a lot
in character and in their daily activities, particularly after
they were excluded from the Thomas Cup team," he said.
</P>
<P>
Flandy and Didi have been known for being moody. They have the
ability to beat the best pairs in the world when they are in a
good mood, but they can also lose to team ranked much lower than
them if they are in a bad mood.
</P>
<P>
"Flandy and Didi don't feel guilty after losing a match. That'
s the difference between them and Candra and Tony," Christian
added.

<HEADLINE> China Unveils Team for Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- China unveiled the final name
list for the Sydney Olympics next month and hopes to maintain
their status in the medal tally four years ago in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
A total of 311 athletes including 107 male and 204 female
participants will take part in 25 of the 27 Olympic disciplines at
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
China sent 309 athletes to the Atlanta Olympics in 1996 and
placed fourth in the final medal standings with 16 gold medals.
</P>
<P>
"We have two main goals for the Sydney Olympics," Yuan Weimin,
President of the Chinese Olympic Committee, said at a news
conference here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"One is to surpass the medal haul from the Atlanta Games four
years ago, and the other is to make success not only from the
athletic but also from the spiritual perspective."
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve spiritual success, which means to ensure a
clean Olympics for the Chinese athletes, China has carried out 2,
268 doping tests on the athletes this year.
</P>
<P>
Over 300 of which were blood tests and 53.6 percent tests were
done out of competition, Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese athletes could win up over 20 gold medals at Sydney,
mainly from weightlifting, gymnastics, table tennis, shooting,
badminton, diving and judo events, Yuan predicted. But he
declined to give an exact number in his prediction.
</P>
<P>
Yuan said it will be a tough battle between France, hosts
Australia and China for the fourth spot in the final medal tally.

<HEADLINE> Asian Athletes to Excel in Marathon, Walking in Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Asian athletes can defeat
athletes from Western and African countries in the marathon and
long-distance walking events at the Sydney Olympic next month,
according to Asian Amateur Athletics Association Secretary-general
Maurice Nicholas.
</P>
<P>
Nocholas said women's and men's marathoners from Japan and
South Korea had undergone long-term training to prepare themselves
to win Olympic medals.
</P>
<P>
And the Chinese women are ready to take the lead in the walking
event and the long-distance races, particularly the 10,000 meters,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the long-distance events, I believe controversial Chinese
coach Ma Junren has some good women's runners for the Olympics,"
he was quoted by the Jakarta Post ss saying.
</P>
<P>
He also said China and Kazakhstan boasted shot putters who
could challenge the world's best.
</P>
<P>
But Asian sprinters still have a long way to go to be able to
surpass their U.S. counterparts.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we can touch the United States sprinters. Our
sprinters have to run below 10 seconds," he said, adding that the
exception was top Japanese sprinter Koji Ito, the Asian record
holder with a time of 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Ito said earlier he might not win an Olympic medal but he
planned to break 10-second barrier. He clocked an unofficial time
of 9.9 seconds at a domestic exhibition in June last year.
</P>
<P>
Nicholas said other Asian countries had prepared their Olympic
athletes to perform at their best in the quadrennial event.
</P>
<P>
"I think every country has dreams of Olympics medals. Each
country has their own training programs and produces good athletes.
So far, Japan, China, South Korea, India and Qatar have tried very
hard," he added.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Urged to Take Measures to Identify Talented Sportswomen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 27 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's veteran
marathon runner Blanche Moila has said there is a need to
establish sport's academies to identify talented sportswomen early
and guide their development, South African Press Association
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
She was speaking to more than 200 people who attended the Women
in Sport Conference in Durban North on Saturday hosted by the
KwaZulu-Natal Province's department of sport and recreation.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the conference was to motivate women to play a more
meaningful role within their own sports codes and in sport as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
Moila said special programs can be established in KwaZulu-Natal
Province whereby school pupils identified as having potential can
be admitted to the academy.
</P>
<P>
"Here the instructor would be responsible for their educational
needs and recreation, and groom them to succeed in their specific
codes," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Sport liberates a woman. We are inhibited because of the way
we are nurtured, but sports make you feel good about yourself,
giving you dignity and helping you cope with the stresses of
everyday life," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
Moila, the holder of 38 major road running titles, further said:
"Although Athletics South Africa has afforded each province a
budget for development it is not being used effectively."
</P>
<P>
She said sports administrators would rather bus students to an
event to watch others perform than spend the money training
students to develop their own sporting talents.
</P>
<P>
Moila also noted the importance of physical education at school,
saying this is where potential stars are spotted.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Send 439-member Delegation to Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A total of 439 Japanese athletes
and officials will join the Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
It is the second largest Olympic team with 158 male and 110
female athletes and 171 officials, following a record 499 people
in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Despite sending a record 310 athletes to Atlanta, Japan
returned with only three gold medals, all in Judo.
</P>
<P>
In Sydney, the Japanese have set their sights higher, with
Olympic officials optimistically talking of at least doubling
their Atlanta tally.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, we can win eight gold medals. But anything will
happen in the Olympics. Some say we win five gold, six silver and
three bronze medals at best, but I must say we have chances for
eight gold medals," said Japanese Olympic Committee president and
team leader Yushiro Yagi.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, general team coach Nobuyuki Sato said: "I hope we
can better the results in Atlanta where we ended with three gold,
six silver and five bronze medals.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, we can win five golds -- in judo and other events.
If we win more than five golds, we can say it was a success."

<P>
CANBERRA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Australian Ian Thorpe, who has
set or bettered 10 world records in the last two years, won 200-
meter freestyle Sunday in his final competitive swim in Melbourne
before his Olympic debut next month.
</P>
<P>
17-year-old Thorpe, who holds world records at the 200 and 400
meter freestyles, clocked 1 minute, 48.9 seconds to win the 200m
freestyle at the Melbourne swimming Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
Paul Palmer of Britain placed second in 1:50.46 and Australia's
Grant Hackett was third in 1:50.51.
</P>
<P>
Russian sprint ace Alex Popov won the 50m-100m freestyle double
in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
Popov timed 22.34 seconds to beat Australian Brett Hawke in
Sunday's 50m freestyle.

swimmer to win the same event at three successive Olympics.

<P>
In the 100m butterfly, Australia's Geoff Huegill beat world No.
1 Klim by 0.08 of a second.

BRUSSELS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Mika Hakkinen overtook Michael
Schumacher with four laps to go to snatch the Formula One Belgian
Grand Prix on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Finn, off the starting block from the pole position, was
overtaken on the 12th lap when he himself made an error only to
veer his McLaren racer off the track.
</P>
<P>
The luck, however, was with Hakkinen in that his car did not
spin much on the turf.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher, who abandoned three of his last four races and
finished runner-up behind Hakkinen in the Hungarian Grand Prix,
was the fourth to start but squeezed into second after only four
laps of race that started after heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
Sundays' win further opened the gap in between Hakkinen and
Schumacher on the world championship driver standings after 13 of
the season's 17 races.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen now has 74 points whereas Schumacher gets 68 points.

<P>
BRUSSELS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Mika Hakkinen overtook Michael
Schumacher with four laps to go to snatch the Formula One Belgian
Grand Prix on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The victory, his first in Belgium, furthered the Finn's lead on
this year's world champinship driver standing. He now has 74
points from 13 of the season's 17 races whereas Schumacher gets 68
points.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen clocked one hour 28 minutes 14.49 seconds from the 44-
lap, 306.5-kilometer race. Schumacher came home 1.10 seconds
adrift. The Belgian track has been depicted by the drivers as the
most challenging on the circuit for its sharp corners.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish driver, off the starting block from the pole
position, was overtaken on the 12th lap when he himself made an
error only to veer his McLaren racer off the track.
</P>
<P>
The luck, however, was with Hakkinen in that his car did not
spin much on the turf and still pointed toward the direction of
the race.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher, who abandoned three of his last four races and
finished runner-up behind Hakkinen in the Hungarian Grand Prix,
was the fourth to start but squeezed into second after four laps
of race that started after heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen kept pressure on Schumacher by dogging the German's
Ferrari for most of the laps toward the end of the race before he
made his move to overtake.
</P>
<P>
There was a car just in front of a tight corner. Leader
Schumacher pulled his car toward the far side for a classic corner
taking but the Finn, spotting the space already left open by the
driver of that car, took the near side for a difficult corner
taking.
</P>
<P>
Yet the move well paid off when Hakkinen grabbed back the
leader's position on the corner and held to it until the checked
flag.
</P>
<P>
Ralf Schumacher, brother of Michael, sped across the finish
flag a further 38.09 seconds behind for the third spot.

BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Guo'an and Chongxing
Longxin will vie for the title of the Chinese Football Association
(CFA) Cup after beating their rivals on the aggregate respectively
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Guo'an lost to the visiting Wuhan Hearts K 1-0 at Sunday's
second leg of the semi-finals but a 3-1 first leg victory was
enough to anchor them the final berth.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Bin scored the only goal for the Wuhan side in the 72nd
minute after Guo'an's several golden scoring chances were denied
by Hearts K's goalie Mu Jun.
</P>
<P>
"Our team has rarely played so smartly as in this match at
Beijing in the past few years. This is really a good experience
for our young players," said Yin Lihua, head coach of the Wuhan
team.
</P>
<P>
Wei Kexing, head coach of Guo'an, said his players have tried
their best but they are a little bit "unlucky".
</P>
<P>
"We failed to grasped several good chances," Wei said. "That
also showed that we still have a lot to prove."
</P>
<P>
Chongqing Longxin, who crushed defending champions Luneng
Taishan 3-1 in the first leg, maintained their momentum, winning 2-
1 at home and entered the finals with 5-2 on the aggregate.

time for two booked offences.

<HEADLINE> Surging Domestic Oil Prices Dampen Airlines Profit Margins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- China Aviation Oil Supply
Corporation, the country's sole supplier, has come under fire from
airlines that claim the corporation is using its monopoly to
exploit profits from air carriers.
</P>
<P>
The per ton (220 gallons) oil price was 2,700 yuan (320 U.S.
dollars) in July from 2,000 yuan in November last year, up 35
percent in nine months, according to the China Daily.
</P>
<P>
But Guo Yongnian, general manager of China Aviation Oil Supply
said he did not agree that his company had profited from the
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
"Domestic oil prices go along with the world market because
almost one-fourth of China's oil comes from imports," he said.
</P>
<P>
Transporting the oil raised the prices the most and the small
scale of China's aviation-oil industry is another major reason for
the high prices, said Guo.
</P>
<P>
The airlines have complained that the price of aviation oil in
China is much higher than international prices and they are
required to buy oil from the State-Owned supplier.

<HEADLINE> New Sowing Technique for Rice Planting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A new sowing technique invented
by local farmers might challenge the traditional rice-planting
method in China.
</P>
<P>
With the technique, it only takes two minutes to sow a mu (0.
0667 hectares) of paddy field, while traditional sowing with hand
usually takes nearly three quarters.
</P>
<P>
Compared with machine sowing, the new technology only requires
one twentieth of investment, and it costs 150 yuan less in sowing
a mu of a paddy field.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, all such complicated procedures as sprouting
cultivation and transplanting of seedlings can be replaced with
the new technology.
</P>
<P>
Luo Yaogen, the inventor in Linhai City, said that rice
seedlings, already sprouting after being immersed in water for a
whole night, will be put in a modified motor sprayer and directly
sprayed onto the paddy field, just "like spraying chemicals."
</P>
<P>
This efficient technique with relatively low cost should be
popularized in a major rice producer like China, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Some other experts regarded the technique "another revolution
following machine sowing in the history of rice-planting."

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Taiwan's Future Lies in Nation's Reunification (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Taiwan Leader's delay in
deciding whether to assume the chairmanship of the "National
Unification Council" shows that he is still evading the "one China
" principle and that he has not essentially changed his support
for "Taiwan independence", said a Xinhua commentary today.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that on August 17 the Taiwan leader told
the media that he had not decided whether he would head the "
National Unification Council," but the council must be reorganized,
its guidelines need to be reviewed and revised. He even went so
far as to say that reunification is not the only and last
alternative.
</P>
<P>
The leader's act and statements are no good for easing and
improving cross-straits relations, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
According to the "National Unification Guidelines" drafted by
the Taiwan authorities in 1991, the leader of the Taiwan
authorities should be the chairman of the "National Unification
Council." The guidelines firmly support the "one China" principle,
and made it clear that it should be the common responsibility of
the entire Chinese people to promote the nation's reunification.
</P>
<P>
Over the three months since his taking office, the Taiwan
leader has taken an evasive and ambiguous attitude toward the "one
China" principle, and the "National Unification Council" and "
National Unification Guidelines" as well.

The visitors, most coming here for the first time, will find

said.
</P>
<P>
The repertoire includes instrumental performances, dances by

English poem by a paralyzed former gymnast Sang Lan sitting in her
wheelchair.

values, Deng said, noting that in the performance, the Chinese
artists will also be joined by 20 American children in singing a

<HEADLINE> UK Seeks to Win Release of Soldiers Captive In Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We have made contact with those who appear to be holding the
men," a defense ministry spokesman said, adding that "discussions
are at a very early stage."
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman acknowledged that Britain was "working
closely with the government of Sierra Leone to try to bring this
to a conclusion."
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Defense said on Saturday that the leader of the
11-man British team, which was captured on Friday while patrolling
near Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, had been in contact
and said all were "being fed and well-treated."
</P>
<P>
"We have made contact with those who appear to be holding" the
men, a Defense Ministry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Reports here quoted a British force spokesman in Freetown as
saying that "efforts are still going on to secure their safe
release. Negotiations are going on."
</P>
<P>
Earlier in London, Defense Minister John Spellar said he was
quite optimistic about the release of the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
"Together with the Sierra Leonean government we will be working
very hard to resolve this," Spellar said.
</P>
<P>
The British troops were reportedly stationed at a base about
40 kilometers east of Freetown, where British instructors are
training Sierra Leonean army recruits. They were accompanied by a
government soldier, who was acting as their guide and was also
believed to have been captured.
</P>
<P>
Since Sierra Leone's civil war began in 1991, the rebels have
killed tens of thousands of people in an attempt to gain control
of the government and the country's diamond-mining regions.
</P>
<P>
Britain sent 1,000 soldiers to Freetown in May when the rebels
re-started the conflict, seizing 500 United Nations peacekeepers
and advancing towards the capital. Their presence was thought to
have done much to stabilize the situation in Sierra Leone, a
former British colony.
</P>
<P>
When the British forces withdrew in mid-June, they left behind
about 400 soldiers to train Sierra Leone army recruits.
</P>
<P>
Britain has also donated arms and equipment and sent military
advisers to Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Syrian FM Pessimistic About Resumption of Peace Process With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk
Shareh said here on Sunday that he is pessimistic about the
perspective of a resumption of peace process between his country
and Israel in near future.
</P>
<P>
In a statement made after a meeting with French President
Jacques Chirac, Shareh said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
missed an important chance to make peace with Syria a few months
ago.
</P>
<P>
He was apparently referring to the failure of the summit
meeting held in March in Geneva between U.S. President Bill
Clinton and the late President Hafez Assad of Syria.
</P>
<P>
"The situation of the Israeli government does not encourage the
realization of peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the problem of Jerusalem, Shareh said that Syria is opposed
to any "dealing" on the question of Arab sovereignty over
Jerusalem.
</P>

Shareh also expressed his hope that France and European
countries will play an efficient role in pushing forward the
process for a just and global peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
France, which is the current rotating presidency state of the
European Union, has been encouraging both Syria and Israel to
resume their peace process, which has been suspended since January
mainly because of the refusal of Israel to pull out of the Golan
Heights it occupied in 1967.

Israeli Interim Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben Ami is due to hold
talks with his French counterpart Hubert Vedrine on Monday in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an Israeli minister recently hinted that Israel
might pull out from Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin said last Wednesday
that Israel should withdraw from the Golan Heights, because it was
a territory occupied by Israel since 1967.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Friday published a
draft legislation to join an International Criminal Court intended
to try perpetrators of crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told reporters that the
government hoped that the draft bill could be passed into law
quickly to add weight to an international drive for the court to
be set up.
</P>
<P>
"It will put on notice the dictators of the future that they
cannot get away with mass murder, with genocide, with crimes
against humanity," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Britain had been entangled in 1998 in the case of Augusto
Pinochet, the former Chilean leader who was arrested in London
when Spain said it wanted him tried for crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
But Pinochet was allowed to return to Chile from Britain in
March after a 17-month legal battle concluded that he could not be
extradited and tried because of ill health.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Neighboring Countries Show Concerns About Plan Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The neighboring countries of
Colombia have recently expressed worries about the negative
impacts of Plan Colombia, fearing it could endanger the security
situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Plan Colombia, hailed by Colombia as "a plan for peace," is a
massive anti-drug operation with investments of 7.5 billion U.S.
dollars, to which the United States will contribute 1.3 billion
dollars, most of it in military assistance.
</P>
<P>
Colombian Foreign Minister Guillermo Fernandez de Soto on
August 24 reaffirmed that Plan Colombia "is a plan of the
Colombians for the Colombians."
</P>
<P>
But Colombia's neighbors fear that the drug war could push the
fighting over their borders, causing an exodus of refugees and
endangering their national security.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel recently showed
his worries about a massive displacement of Colombians, drug
traffickers and guerrillas toward its territory as a consequence
of the implementation of the military part of the plan.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori on Friday made a strong
criticism of the plan, saying "the regional security and that of
the Andean Community is in peril before a three-billion-dollar
military project that Colombia plans to implement along the next
two years."
</P>
<P>
Brazil and Ecuador echoed the concerns of Venezuela and Peru
about the negative effects of Plan Colombia. Ecuador and Venezuela
are making efforts to prevent the entry of Colombian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Plan Colombia and the U.S. aid to Colombia will be among the
main topics at the coming South American Summit scheduled for
August 31-September 1 in Brasilia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States on Friday tried to reassure wary
Latin American nations about its growing military involvement in
Colombia, saying that it will not blow up into a major war that
could spill over into their territories.
</P>
<P>
The Latin American countries' skepticism about the U.S. aid
plan was based on a misunderstanding of its limited nature, said
Thomas Pickering, U.S. undersecretary of state for political
affairs.
</P>
<P>
The United States will pour the 1.3 billion dollars in aid into
Colombia over the next two years, mostly in military backing for a
drive against drug traffickers and armed rebels protecting cocaine
and heroin production in the South American country.
</P>
<P>
Critics say the plan could drag the United States into a
Vietnam-like war in Latin America.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Religious Leaders Conclude Visit to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A delegation consisting of
seven top leaders of Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Catholicism and
Christianity in China has concluded a friendly and goodwill visit
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
During their stay in Los Angeles and Washington, the Chinese
religious leaders met their American counterparts, scholars and
overseas Chinese, many of whom acknowledged that Chinese citizens
enjoy true religious freedom and believed that the visit helped
enhance Americans' understanding of the religious freedom in China.
</P>
<P>
The visit also cleared some misunderstanding and laid a new
foundation for increased contact and cooperation between Chinese
and U.S. religious circles.
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Fu Tieshan, head of the delegation and chairman
of China Catholicism Association, told a forum that freedom of
religion in China is protected by the Constitution and religions
in China are entering a "golden age."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Falun Gong cult is misleading and cheating
people, violating human rights and jeopardizing society.
</P>
<P>
Chinese religious societies firmly support the government's
decision to ban the cult, Buddhist Master Sheng Hui said, adding
that the religious circles had begun to boycott and reject Falun
Gong as early as in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The cult is directly responsible for the death of more than 1,
600 people and harm people in the same way as drugs do, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Dalai Lama, the delegation members said the Dalai Lama
has been engaging in activities designed to split China, which
will bring calamity to religions, Tibet and the entire country,
therefore his presence at the Millennium World Peace Summit runs
counter to the peace theme of the meeting.

WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese photograph
exhibition opened here Saturday at the Kennedy Center, creating an
atmosphere of Chinese culture in one of the most prestigious arts
centers in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The show, which will be on until September 17, is one of the
two exhibitions of the Chinese culture exchange tour in the United
States, with nearly 100 photographic works on display.
</P>
<P>
Some of the pictures by Chinese professional and amateur
photographers, such as "Karst landscape" and "The water-splashing
festival of the Dai people," depict the nature in its many shapes
and hues as well as the lifestyles and customs of the Chinese
people.
</P>
<P>
Some reflect the spirit of the Chinese people dedicated to the
modernization drive while others, for instance, "Street scene in
Beijing," record great changes that have taken place in China.
</P>
<P>
Appreciating the pictures, American journalist Bill Jones said
that such exhibition is important for helping Americans to
understand China.
</P>
<P>
"Many Americans have never been abroad," said Jones. "And they
got to know China mainly from America's strong media, whose
reporting could be partial. I think the exhibition can tell them
something true about China."
</P>
<P>
Jones said that he believed some Americans might think of
visiting China after seeing the photographic works.
</P>
<P>
The culture tour, which started on August 24 with a traditional
Chinese concert in U.N. Assembly Hall, will conclude on September
17 with a folk dance performance in Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Moscow TV Tower Fire Spreads, Nobody Hurt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A fire that broke out earlier
Sunday at the world's second tallest TV tower in Moscow is
spreading, but nobody was hurt.
</P>
<P>
As a result, most television programs and radio broadcast have
been knocked off the air in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
All people have been evacuated from the tower and authorities
are warning about possible malfunctions in communications at the
frequencies used by medical services and the police.
</P>
<P>
The fire was allegedly caused by a short circuit at a
transmitter of a paging company. Many paging services have been
suspended.
</P>
<P>
The Ostankino TV and BC center, inaugurated in November 1967,
is the second tallest freestanding building in the world, just
after the one in Toronto, Canada.
</P>
<P>
Weighing more than 55,000 tons, the structure is 540 meters
tall. Visitors can reach the observation deck at 337 meters in 58
seconds by the elevator.
</P>
<P>
There are three dining rooms below the observation deck.

<HEADLINE> Liezel Horn listed for Women's Doubles Tennis in Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The South African Tennis
Association announced on Saturday that Liezel Horn will replace
injured Mariaan de Swardt to team up with South African ace Amanda
Coetzer for the women's doubles tennis tournament in the Sydney
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"I am really excited about representing South Africa in the
upcoming Olympics. It is a great honour," said Horn, who was
born in South Africa's port city of Durban and has married to her
U.S. coach Tony Huber.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on her and Coetzer's chances in Sydney, she said: "I
think we will do just fine. We speak the same language and our
games will complement each other, Amanda being more of a baseline
player and me the aggressive person at the net."
</P>
<P>
"Although we have yet to play together on the tour, there is no
better time to start than at the Olympics," Horn added.
</P>
<P>
However, she also reckoned that the U.S. pairing of Venus and
Serena Williams will be the team to beat for the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Horn, a doulbes quarter-finalist at this year's French Open as
well as a semi-finalst and quarter-finalist respectively at the
1999 Wimbledon and U.S. Open, was once ranked as high as 131st in
the world singles rankings and reached a year ago a career-high
world doubles ranking of No 32.
</P>
<P>
Looking to the future, Horn said: "If everything goes well with
my career, I definitely hope to represent South Africa for a long
time to come. But right now I am focusing on the present."

<HEADLINE> Comets Win Fourth Straight WNBA Title in Overtime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Cynthia Cooper paced three-
time defending champions Houston Comets to a 79-73 overtime
victory, winning for herself fourth straight championships MVP
award and a fourth straight WNBA title for the team in Houston
Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Cooper scored 25 points in her final game, including a three-
pointer that forced the overtime against the New York Liberty.
She helped the Comets top the Liberty in the finals for the third
time. New York also was the victim in 1997 and last season.
</P>
<P>
Houston became the first professional basketball team in the
United States to win four straight titles since NBA's Boston
Celtics captured eight in a row from 1959-66. The Comets roared
through the postseason at 6-0 and remain the WNBA's only champions.
</P>
<P>
Cooper scored nine of her team's final 18 points and nailed a 3-
pointer with 21 seconds left in regulation to forge a 64-64 tie.
The Liberty had grabbed a three-point lead with 32 seconds to play
on a lay-up by Tari Phillips.
</P>
<P>
New York had a chance to steal Game Two, as it did last season
on Teresa Weatherspoon's stunning backcourt shot. Veteran forward
Sue Wicks drove the baseline and missed a lay-up, with Cooper
grabbing the rebound as time expired.
</P>
<P>
Cooper began her dramatics in the extra session when she hit a
tough lay-up with 2:34 left for a 69-67 cushion. But the Liberty
responded as Wicks, who was 1-for-5 from 3-point range all season,
connected from beyond the arc with 2:14 left for a one-point lead.
</P>
<P>
Cooper nailed two free throws with 1:41 to play and, after
Vickie Johnson missed a jumper for the Liberty, the 37-year-old
superstar hit a runner with 53 seconds remaining for a 73-70 bulge.
</P>
<P>
Tina Thompson made two from the line with 27 seconds left and
former Liberty Coquese Washington followed suit 10 seconds later
for a 77-70 advantage. At the
final buzzer, Cooper jumped into Thompson's arms and later was
lifted in exultation by teammates.
</P>
<P>
Sheryl Swoopes scored a playoff career-high 31 points and
Thompson added 11 for the Comets, who outscored the Liberty, 15-9,
in overtime.
</P>
<P>
Phillips finished with 20 points for New York but fouled out
with 3:57 left in overtime. Tamika Whitmore added 15 points and
Crystal Robinson chipped in 13 off the bench.
</P>
<P>
The loss was especially painful for Weatherspoon, the energetic
point guard who was one of New York's two original players. She
fouled out with 27 seconds left in overtime and draped a towel
over her head while pondering what might have been.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Men's Doubles Set For Big Battle in Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's best hope in the
Olympic badminton event, men's doubles entry Candra Wijaya and
Tony Gunawan, have had near-perfect preparations for the Games, an
offocial of the Badminton Association of Indonesia said.
</P>
<P>
"Candra and Tony are never satisfied with routine preparations.
They have been adding extra training sessions prior to the event.
They are not over-excited or over-confident about winning the gold
medal. They just don't want to waste time in gaining self-
confidence," Christian Hadinata, the training director of the
Association, was quoted by Jakarta Post Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Candra and Tony, the world's top-ranked doubles pair, are
favored to bring home the gold.
</P>
<P>
Tony said earlier if they had to settle for the silver, they
would have failed in their mission.
</P>
<P>
Christian, a former doubles specialist himself, said he was not
worried the players would be burdened by the expectations. "They
have always considered all the possibilities in every move. They
want perfect preparations. They just want to get better and
better in every tournament. You remember how guilty Candra was
when he and Sigit Budiarto lost in the Thomas Cup semifinals
against Denmark. He didn't even want to see the last match," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Christian said the shuttlers inability to accept defeat made
them that much stronger in tournaments.
</P>
<P>
Besides Candra and Tony, Indonesia's Olympic badminton squad
will include world number two of Flandy Limpele and Eng Hian and
world number five and 1996 gold medalists Ricky Subagja and Rexy
Mainaky.
</P>
<P>
"Both Flandy and Didi (Eng Hian's nickname) have changed a lot
in character and in their daily activities, particularly after
they were excluded from the Thomas Cup team," he said.
</P>
<P>
Flandy and Didi have been known for being moody. They have the
ability to beat the best pairs in the world when they are in a
good mood, but they can also lose to team ranked much lower than
them if they are in a bad mood.
</P>
<P>
"Flandy and Didi don't feel guilty after losing a match. That'
s the difference between them and Candra and Tony," Christian
added.

<HEADLINE> China Unveils Team for Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- China unveiled the final name
list for the Sydney Olympics next month and hopes to maintain
their status in the medal tally four years ago in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
A total of 311 athletes including 107 male and 204 female
participants will take part in 25 of the 27 Olympic disciplines at
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
China sent 309 athletes to the Atlanta Olympics in 1996 and
placed fourth in the final medal standings with 16 gold medals.
</P>
<P>
"We have two main goals for the Sydney Olympics," Yuan Weimin,
President of the Chinese Olympic Committee, said at a news
conference here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"One is to surpass the medal haul from the Atlanta Games four
years ago, and the other is to make success not only from the
athletic but also from the spiritual perspective."
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve spiritual success, which means to ensure a
clean Olympics for the Chinese athletes, China has carried out 2,
268 doping tests on the athletes this year.
</P>
<P>
Over 300 of which were blood tests and 53.6 percent tests were
done out of competition, Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese athletes could win up over 20 gold medals at Sydney,
mainly from weightlifting, gymnastics, table tennis, shooting,
badminton, diving and judo events, Yuan predicted. But he
declined to give an exact number in his prediction.
</P>
<P>
Yuan said it will be a tough battle between France, hosts
Australia and China for the fourth spot in the final medal tally.

<HEADLINE> Asian Athletes to Excel in Marathon, Walking in Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Asian athletes can defeat
athletes from Western and African countries in the marathon and
long-distance walking events at the Sydney Olympic next month,
according to Asian Amateur Athletics Association Secretary-general
Maurice Nicholas.
</P>
<P>
Nocholas said women's and men's marathoners from Japan and
South Korea had undergone long-term training to prepare themselves
to win Olympic medals.
</P>
<P>
And the Chinese women are ready to take the lead in the walking
event and the long-distance races, particularly the 10,000 meters,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the long-distance events, I believe controversial Chinese
coach Ma Junren has some good women's runners for the Olympics,"
he was quoted by the Jakarta Post ss saying.
</P>
<P>
He also said China and Kazakhstan boasted shot putters who
could challenge the world's best.
</P>
<P>
But Asian sprinters still have a long way to go to be able to
surpass their U.S. counterparts.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we can touch the United States sprinters. Our
sprinters have to run below 10 seconds," he said, adding that the
exception was top Japanese sprinter Koji Ito, the Asian record
holder with a time of 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Ito said earlier he might not win an Olympic medal but he
planned to break 10-second barrier. He clocked an unofficial time
of 9.9 seconds at a domestic exhibition in June last year.
</P>
<P>
Nicholas said other Asian countries had prepared their Olympic

So far, Japan, China, South Korea, India and Qatar have tried very
hard," he added.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Urged to Take Measures to Identify Talented Sportswomen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 27 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's veteran
marathon runner Blanche Moila has said there is a need to
establish sport's academies to identify talented sportswomen early
and guide their development, South African Press Association
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
She was speaking to more than 200 people who attended the Women
in Sport Conference in Durban North on Saturday hosted by the
KwaZulu-Natal Province's department of sport and recreation.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the conference was to motivate women to play a more
meaningful role within their own sports codes and in sport as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
Moila said special programs can be established in KwaZulu-Natal
Province whereby school pupils identified as having potential can
be admitted to the academy.
</P>
<P>
"Here the instructor would be responsible for their educational
needs and recreation, and groom them to succeed in their specific
codes," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Sport liberates a woman. We are inhibited because of the way
we are nurtured, but sports make you feel good about yourself,
giving you dignity and helping you cope with the stresses of
everyday life," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
Moila, the holder of 38 major road running titles, further said:
"Although Athletics South Africa has afforded each province a
budget for development it is not being used effectively."
</P>
<P>
She said sports administrators would rather bus students to an
event to watch others perform than spend the money training
students to develop their own sporting talents.
</P>
<P>
Moila also noted the importance of physical education at school,
saying this is where potential stars are spotted.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Send 439-member Delegation to Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A total of 439 Japanese athletes
and officials will join the Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
It is the second largest Olympic team with 158 male and 110
female athletes and 171 officials, following a record 499 people
in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Despite sending a record 310 athletes to Atlanta, Japan
returned with only three gold medals, all in Judo.
</P>
<P>
In Sydney, the Japanese have set their sights higher, with
Olympic officials optimistically talking of at least doubling
their Atlanta tally.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, we can win eight gold medals. But anything will
happen in the Olympics. Some say we win five gold, six silver and
three bronze medals at best, but I must say we have chances for
eight gold medals," said Japanese Olympic Committee president and
team leader Yushiro Yagi.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, general team coach Nobuyuki Sato said: "I hope we
can better the results in Atlanta where we ended with three gold,
six silver and five bronze medals.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, we can win five golds -- in judo and other events.
If we win more than five golds, we can say it was a success."

<P>
CANBERRA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Australian Ian Thorpe, who has
set or bettered 10 world records in the last two years, won 200-
meter freestyle Sunday in his final competitive swim in Melbourne
before his Olympic debut next month.
</P>
<P>
17-year-old Thorpe, who holds world records at the 200 and 400
meter freestyles, clocked 1 minute, 48.9 seconds to win the 200m
freestyle at the Melbourne swimming Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
Paul Palmer of Britain placed second in 1:50.46 and Australia's
Grant Hackett was third in 1:50.51.
</P>
<P>
Russian sprint ace Alex Popov won the 50m-100m freestyle double
in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
Popov timed 22.34 seconds to beat Australian Brett Hawke in
Sunday's 50m freestyle.

swimmer to win the same event at three successive Olympics.

<P>
In the 100m butterfly, Australia's Geoff Huegill beat world No.
1 Klim by 0.08 of a second.

BRUSSELS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Mika Hakkinen overtook Michael
Schumacher with four laps to go to snatch the Formula One Belgian
Grand Prix on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Finn, off the starting block from the pole position, was
overtaken on the 12th lap when he himself made an error only to
veer his McLaren racer off the track.
</P>
<P>
The luck, however, was with Hakkinen in that his car did not
spin much on the turf.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher, who abandoned three of his last four races and
finished runner-up behind Hakkinen in the Hungarian Grand Prix,
was the fourth to start but squeezed into second after only four
laps of race that started after heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
Sundays' win further opened the gap in between Hakkinen and
Schumacher on the world championship driver standings after 13 of
the season's 17 races.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen now has 74 points whereas Schumacher gets 68 points.

<P>
BRUSSELS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Mika Hakkinen overtook Michael
Schumacher with four laps to go to snatch the Formula One Belgian
Grand Prix on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The victory, his first in Belgium, furthered the Finn's lead on
this year's world champinship driver standing. He now has 74
points from 13 of the season's 17 races whereas Schumacher gets 68
points.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen clocked one hour 28 minutes 14.49 seconds from the 44-
lap, 306.5-kilometer race. Schumacher came home 1.10 seconds
adrift. The Belgian track has been depicted by the drivers as the
most challenging on the circuit for its sharp corners.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish driver, off the starting block from the pole
position, was overtaken on the 12th lap when he himself made an
error only to veer his McLaren racer off the track.
</P>
<P>
The luck, however, was with Hakkinen in that his car did not
spin much on the turf and still pointed toward the direction of
the race.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher, who abandoned three of his last four races and
finished runner-up behind Hakkinen in the Hungarian Grand Prix,
was the fourth to start but squeezed into second after four laps
of race that started after heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen kept pressure on Schumacher by dogging the German's
Ferrari for most of the laps toward the end of the race before he
made his move to overtake.
</P>
<P>
There was a car just in front of a tight corner. Leader
Schumacher pulled his car toward the far side for a classic corner
taking but the Finn, spotting the space already left open by the
driver of that car, took the near side for a difficult corner
taking.
</P>
<P>
Yet the move well paid off when Hakkinen grabbed back the
leader's position on the corner and held to it until the checked
flag.
</P>
<P>
Ralf Schumacher, brother of Michael, sped across the finish
flag a further 38.09 seconds behind for the third spot.

BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Guo'an and Chongxing
Longxin will vie for the title of the Chinese Football Association
(CFA) Cup after beating their rivals on the aggregate respectively
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Guo'an lost to the visiting Wuhan Hearts K 1-0 at Sunday's
second leg of the semi-finals but a 3-1 first leg victory was
enough to anchor them the final berth.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Bin scored the only goal for the Wuhan side in the 72nd
minute after Guo'an's several golden scoring chances were denied
by Hearts K's goalie Mu Jun.
</P>
<P>
"Our team has rarely played so smartly as in this match at
Beijing in the past few years. This is really a good experience
for our young players," said Yin Lihua, head coach of the Wuhan
team.
</P>
<P>
Wei Kexing, head coach of Guo'an, said his players have tried
their best but they are a little bit "unlucky".
</P>
<P>
"We failed to grasped several good chances," Wei said. "That
also showed that we still have a lot to prove."
</P>
<P>
Chongqing Longxin, who crushed defending champions Luneng
Taishan 3-1 in the first leg, maintained their momentum, winning 2-
1 at home and entered the finals with 5-2 on the aggregate.

time for two booked offences.

<HEADLINE> Surging Domestic Oil Prices Dampen Airlines Profit Margins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- China Aviation Oil Supply
Corporation, the country's sole supplier, has come under fire from
airlines that claim the corporation is using its monopoly to
exploit profits from air carriers.
</P>
<P>
The per ton (220 gallons) oil price was 2,700 yuan (320 U.S.
dollars) in July from 2,000 yuan in November last year, up 35
percent in nine months, according to the China Daily.
</P>
<P>
But Guo Yongnian, general manager of China Aviation Oil Supply
said he did not agree that his company had profited from the
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
"Domestic oil prices go along with the world market because
almost one-fourth of China's oil comes from imports," he said.
</P>
<P>
Transporting the oil raised the prices the most and the small
scale of China's aviation-oil industry is another major reason for
the high prices, said Guo.
</P>
<P>
The airlines have complained that the price of aviation oil in
China is much higher than international prices and they are
required to buy oil from the State-Owned supplier.

If the Taiwan leader refuses to recognize the "one China"
principle, improvement of cross-straits relations would be out of

</P>
<P>
The stalemate in cross-straits relations runs counter to the

People suspect that the Taiwan leader's capriciousness harbors
intentions to engage in splittist activities for "Taiwan
Independence," according to the article.
</P>
<P>
It is clear that a great majority of Taiwan people oppose "
Taiwan Independence" and expect stability and development for

turbulence to the future of Taiwan if the leader of Taiwan

<HEADLINE> New Sowing Technique for Rice Planting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A new sowing technique invented
by local farmers might challenge the traditional rice-planting
method in China.
</P>
<P>
With the technique, it only takes two minutes to sow a mu (0.
0667 hectares) of paddy field, while traditional sowing with hand
usually takes nearly three quarters.
</P>
<P>
Compared with machine sowing, the new technology only requires
one twentieth of investment, and it costs 150 yuan less in sowing
a mu of a paddy field.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, all such complicated procedures as sprouting
cultivation and transplanting of seedlings can be replaced with
the new technology.
</P>
<P>
Luo Yaogen, the inventor in Linhai City, said that rice
seedlings, already sprouting after being immersed in water for a
whole night, will be put in a modified motor sprayer and directly
sprayed onto the paddy field, just "like spraying chemicals."
</P>
<P>
This efficient technique with relatively low cost should be
popularized in a major rice producer like China, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Some other experts regarded the technique "another revolution
following machine sowing in the history of rice-planting."

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Taiwan's Future Lies in Nation's Reunification (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Taiwan Leader's delay in
deciding whether to assume the chairmanship of the "National
Unification Council" shows that he is still evading the "one China
" principle and that he has not essentially changed his support
for "Taiwan independence", said a Xinhua commentary today.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that on August 17 the Taiwan leader told
the media that he had not decided whether he would head the "
National Unification Council," but the council must be reorganized,
its guidelines need to be reviewed and revised. He even went so
far as to say that reunification is not the only and last
alternative.
</P>
<P>
The leader's act and statements are no good for easing and
improving cross-straits relations, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
According to the "National Unification Guidelines" drafted by
the Taiwan authorities in 1991, the leader of the Taiwan
authorities should be the chairman of the "National Unification
Council." The guidelines firmly support the "one China" principle,
and made it clear that it should be the common responsibility of
the entire Chinese people to promote the nation's reunification.
</P>
<P>
Over the three months since his taking office, the Taiwan
leader has taken an evasive and ambiguous attitude toward the "one
China" principle, and the "National Unification Council" and "
National Unification Guidelines" as well.

<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Three Israeli soldiers were killed
in a shootout with Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas)
Saturday night in northern West Bank, Israeli army confirmed
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The clash erupted at 10 p.m. (1900 GMT) Saturday night when
hundreds of Israeli soliders stormed the Palestinian village of
Assira Ashamalieh near Nablus, which is believed to be one of
Hamas' strongholds and home to Mahmoud Abu Hanoud, the No.1 on
Israeli most wanted list.
</P>
<P>
Abu Hanoud was believed to be the mastermind for two suicide
bombings in Jerusalem in 1997, in which 43 people, including five
militants, were killed. He is considered a leader of Hamas'
military wing, Izzedine al Qassam, which has carried out a serious
of suicide bombings.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian militant group Hamas opposes making peace with
Israel and favors armed struggle to retrieve lands occupied by
Israel. It has carried out a series of bombing attacks on Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses of the Palestinian village said they heard gunfire
when the Israeli troops surrounded the region and began a house-to-
house search.
</P>
<P>
They also said Israeli helicopters hovered overhead to
illuminate the village and at the beginning, Israeli side refused
to allow ambulances to enter the village that is jointly-controlled
by Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Radio of Israel said Sunday Abu Hanoud was injured in the clash
and is under Palestinian custody.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian security sources confirmed that Abu Hanoud is
treated for gunshot wounds at the heavily-guarded Evangelical
Hospital in the Palestinian-controlled Nablus and was in good
condition.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Israeli authorities said they had discovered a group
of militants in connection with Saudi Arabia-born militant Osama
Bin Laden in the Palestinian-controlled region.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Palestinian police discovered what they called
a explosives plant in totally-Palestinian-controlled Nablus and
arrested some Hamas members.

<HEADLINE> Rallies Turn Violent in Western Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Clashes broke out Saturday evening
in Iran's western city of Khorramabad in Lorestan province as
groups of people conflicted over a pro-reform conference.
</P>
<P>
A group of people rallied in support of the seventh annual
conference of the Office to Foster Unity (OFU), the most
influential student organization in Iran which supports President
Mohammad Khatami's reform programs.
</P>
<P>
But the rallies were hindered and disturbed by unidentified
assailants, which led to clashes, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported Sunday. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
The conference kicked off in Khorramabad on Wednesday with
President Khatami's message, but some groups had protested the
conference and the provincial security department had reportedly
demanded that the OFU member students end their meeting.
</P>
<P>
Some reformist figures were also blocked from entering the
conference site.
</P>
<P>
The clashes finally ended with the intervention of security
forces, but no injuries or arrests were reported.
</P>
<P>
Following the landslide victory of reformers in February's
parliamentary election, the conservatives, who still control the
system, have stepped up their efforts to undermine the reformist
campaign encouraged by President Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The conservative judiciary has thus far banned more than 20 pro-
reforms papers and journals and imprisoned a number of reformist
figures on charges of violating Islamic principles and advocating
American-style reforms.
</P>
<P>
The conservative authorities also directed their affiliated
groups, such as the Basij (voluntary forces formed by students) and
the hardline Ansar-e Hezbollah, to obstruct pro-reform rallies and
movements, which often led to violence.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Drafts Law to Fight Cyber Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus is drafting legislation to
fight computer crimes and Internet porn as part of its European
Union (EU) harmonization process, the Sunday Mail newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
The legislation is expected to be in force by the middle of next
year.
</P>
<P>
"We are drafting legislation on cyber crime generally," said
George Panayiotou, an official at Cyprus' police research
department, adding that a special committee within the Justice
Ministry is preparing the legislation.
</P>
<P>
Panayiotou said current legislation is adequate to cover
Internet crime such as fraud, but the new law will be more
specific.
</P>
<P>
So far, he said, no one in Cyprus has ever been arrested or
charged with any sort of cyber crime, and it is too early to say
where the legislation would draw the line as far as the invasion of
privacy is concerned.
</P>
<P>
Local media recently reported that Interpol had asked Cyprus
police to investigate the circulation of child pornography material
on the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian to Establish DNA Database for Police Investigations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian police are planning to
build up a nation-wide DNA database to help investigate criminal
cases, the semiofficial daily Jordan Times reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
DNA, the shorthand for deoxyribonucleic acid, carries the entire
genetic code of an individual, and the database will help police to
match genetic materials recovered from the scene of a crime with
records from the database.
</P>
<P>
The slightest specimen like hair, nail, blood, skin, semen and
so forth, contains the unique DNA of an individual which will help
police trace down the suspect of a crime.
</P>
<P>
The Public Security Department, the headquarters of the
Jordanian police, planned to establish the DNA database from the
beginning of next year, Jordan Times said.
</P>
<P>
The employment of DNA technique (sometimes called DNA
fingerprinting) is similar to the finger printing process, relying
on each person's unique genetic code to confirm his or her
identity.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the DNA database will be one of the efforts
by the Jordanian police to combat the rising crime rate of the
kingdom triggered by poverty and high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
One third of the kingdom's 4.7 million population live under the
poverty line, or less than 80 Jordanian dinars (112 U.S. dollars) a
month.
</P>
<P>
The official unemployment rate stands at over 14 percent if not
at 27 percent by independent estimates.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Paper Condemns U.S., Britain on No-Fly Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's official daily has chided
the U.S. and Britain for imposing no-fly zones on Iraq, saying the
two countries have been exploiting the restricted areas "for pure
aggressive and espionage purposes."
</P>
<P>
The Ath-Thawra newspaper said the U.S. and Britain capitalized
on the situation following the 1991 Gulf War and set up the no-fly
zones over northern and southern Iraq "in an overt interference in
Iraq's internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its Western allies clamped a no-fly zone in the
north on April 7, 1991 and the other one in the south on August 27,
1992, with a claimed aim of protecting a Kuridsh enclave and
Shi'ite Muslims from possible attacks of Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British planes based in Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait
have since enforced the no-fly zones, not recognized by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain has since used the no-fly zones as a
pretext to proceed with their aggressive policy against Iraq, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The unilateral decision by the U.S. and Britain to establish the
air exclusion zones has got no authorization from the United
Nations Security Council, the paper stressed.
</P>
<P>
The paper held the U.S.-British alliance "fully responsible" for
any consequences of their "illegitimate hostile acts," as Iraq
has "full right of self defense" according to the International
Law.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been challenging the U.S. and British warplanes
overflying the two zones since the U.S.-British air strikes in
December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Yassin Jasim, major general of the Iraqi Air Defense Command,
claimed that the Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery had shot down more
than 10 U.S. and British planes. "We have evidence to prove that,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The claim could not be confirmed by the U.S. and Britain.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak would view a unilateral
declaration of statehood by the Palestinians as sufficient reason
to bring the right-wing opposition Likud into his coalition,
Barak's spokeswoman Merav Parsi-Zadok said Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
She said Barak would announce the guidelines he would like to
follow in forming a coalition within two or three weeks, adding it
depends on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- A heavy exchange of fire Saturday night was reported in the
north of the Palestinian West Bank city of Nablus. Palestinian
sources said Israeli forces, accompanied by four helicopters which
circled overhead, surrounded the village of Atzira al-Shimaliya in
Area B, where Palestinians hold civil control but security is in
Israeli hands. The village is the home to Mahmoud Abu-Hanoud, the
most wanted Hamas leader by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli police have arrested the serial arsonist responsible
for the recent spate of fires at sex shops and brothels in the Tel
Aviv area, including a blaze which killed four prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
Tel Aviv police ambushed Yari Baruchim, 34, early Saturday
morning as he was allegedly preparing to launch firebomb attacks on
other sites.
</P>
<P>
Baruchim, who is an pious Jew, said it was his mission to purify
the city since the police were not doing so.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- United States President Bill Clinton, currently on a three-
day visit to Africa, is to make a hastily arranged stopover in
Egypt on Tuesday for talks with President Hosni Mubarak in a bid to
study proposals Mubarak has made on Jerusalem and to press
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to be more flexible.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which receives some 2 billion dollars in U.S. military
aid annually, was criticized in the U.S. for not having pressured
Arafat to make concessions at last month's Camp David summit.

<HEADLINE> Committee Appointed to Probe Shootout With Hamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Shaul Mofaz, Chief of General
Staff of the Israel Defense Force (IDF), appointed a committee
Sunday to investigate a overnight shootout with Palestinian
militant group in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Three IDF soldiers were killed in the clash with "Palestinian
terrorists" near Nablus Saturday night and a fourth one was
injured, apparently by "friendly fire," the IDF spokesman's office
said Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
The IDF soldiers from an elite unit operating in the Nablus
region were ordered to "manhunt Palestinian terrorists" and the
most wanted Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) terrorist Mahmoud
Abu Hanoud, the office said.
</P>
<P>
Hamas opposes making peace with Israel and favors armed
struggles to retrieve lands occupied by Israel. The Palestinian
radical group has carried out a series of anti-Israeli attacks
since Israel and the Palestinians signed the Oslo peace accords in
1993.
</P>
<P>
Abu Hanoud was accused of masterminding two suicide bombings in
Jerusalem in 1997, in which dozes of people, including five
militants, were killed.
</P>
<P>
A heavy exchange of fire erupted around midnight in the village
of Atzria Shimaliya, north of Nablus, and later on IDF troops,
accompanied by four helicopters hovering overhead, surrounded the
village.
</P>
<P>
The IDF early Sunday morning blew up a house, where the clash
with "Palestinian terrorists" took place, the office said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian authorities were kept informed about the
manhunting and other IDF activities in the area and the Israeli
side has to look into the events and investigate the incident,
Mofaz said.
</P>
<P>
The village is in Area B, which is under Palestinian civilian
jurisdiction but under Israeli security control.
</P>
<P>
The IDF had recently carried out several manhunting of the "
Palestinian terrorists" in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
On August 16, they shot and killed a 73-year-old Palestinian
man, Mahmoud Abdullah, in the village of Surda, north of Ramallah.

<P>
CAIRO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- Syrian Industry Ministry and Italian Land Mark
Company inked a 5-year renewable contract on exporting a minimum of
150,000 Syrian-made shoes to European markets every year within the
trade activity of the Syrian-European Union Business Council.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish Airlines (THY) has planned to carry 12
million passengers by 2001.
</P>
<P>
THY Deputy President Gurol Yuksel said in Istanbul Saturday that
the number of passengers THY carried in July and August was the
highest in its history.
</P>
<P>
Yuksel said the total number of passengers the company carried
had reached 8.2 million by August 2000.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey's major private air company, Istanbul Airlines,
has suspended flights indefinitely due to severe financial
problems.
</P>
<P>
Istanbul Airlines, which was founded 16 years ago, had reduced
its fleet from 17 planes to two over the past several years. It was
sharply affected by last year's dramatic drop in tourism following
two devastating earthquakes and threats from Kurdish rebels to
attack tourists.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey is expected to export 600,000 tons of flour in
2000, compared with 500,000 tons in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General of the Turkish Flour Millers' Association,
Ilker Tanik, explained that there were poor wheat harvests in East
European and Middle East countries, which offer good opportunities
for Turkish exports.
</P>
<P>
But the government's Soil Products Office wants to export more
wheat in 2000-2001.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish state-run steelmaker Erdemir is expected
to export 500,000 tons of flat steel in 2000, bringing earnings of
150 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Erdemir's Deputy General Manager Kemal Ozden told reporters over
the weekend that his company was most likely to exceed its revised
2000 output target of 3.1 million tons, predicting that the revenue
would be higher than its target of 1 billion U.S. dollars.

ANKARA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said on Saturday that "
there are some uncertainties between authorities of the presidency
and the government. We will bring authorities of the presidency
onto agenda."
</P>
<P>
He said "it is too early to say something" about restricting
authorities of the president, but "if we cannot remove these
uncertainties, serious problems may occur."
</P>
<P>
The tension between President Ahmet Necdet Sezer and the
government emerged because of the president's rejection of a
governmental decree for the sacking of civil servants involved in
fundamentalist activities.
</P>
<P>
Yenibinyil:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkey submitted to Tehran once again the documents revealing
Iran's support to the radical Islamic terrorist group Hezbollah and
separatist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The report, conveyed to Iranian Deputy Prime Minister Mohsen
Aminzade who paid an official visit to Ankara last week, said that
members of the Hezbollah have received military and religious
training in Iran, leaving Iran in a difficult position.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet:
</P>
<P>
-- Ecevit has launched an investigation into the burglary of
eight paintings worth millions of U.S. dollars from the Prime
Ministry residence.
</P>
<P>
A recent counting of inventory stock revealed that eight
paintings were missing. The Prime Ministry Inspection Council has
taken actions to find the lost paintings upon directions of the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- As a result of a research carried on 123 bridges and viaducts
in Istanbul, it was understood that most of them can collapse in a
possible earthquake.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that those bridges and viaducts should be
reinforced, adding that the reinforcement could cost 10 percent of
the construction cost of the bridge or viaduct.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Continue Fighting Terrorism: Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Israel will continue to fight
all kinds of terrorist activities despite the heavy prices it has
to pay, Prime Minister Ehud Barak said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In his condolences to the families of the three soldiers of the
Israel Defence Forces (IDF) killed overnight in clashes with
Palestinian militant group Hamas in the West Bank, Barak said the
loss of life of the IDF soldiers could not prevent Israel from
fighting terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Shaul Mofaz, chief of general staff of the IDF, appointed on
Sunday a committee to investigate the incident.
</P>
<P>
Mofaz was quoted by the Israel Radio as saying that he did not
rule out the possibility that the three IDF soldiers "were killed
by friendly fire."
</P>
<P>
The IDF spokesman's office said earlier that the three IDF
soldiers were killed in the clash with "Palestinian terrorists"
near Nablus during Saturday night and a fourth one was injured,
apparently by "friendly fire."
</P>
<P>
The IDF soldiers from an elite unit operating in the Nablus
region were ordered to "manhunt Palestinian terrorists" and the
most wanted Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) terrorist Mahmoud
Abu Hanoud, who was accused of being behind two anti-Israeli
suicide bombings in Jerusalem in 1997.
</P>
<P>
He is considered a leader of Hamas' military wing, Izzedine al
Qassam, which has carried out a serious of suicide bombings.
</P>
<P>
A heavy exchange of fire erupted around midnight in the village
of Atzria Shimaliya, north of Nablus, and later on IDF troops,
accompanied by four helicopters which circled overhead, surrounded
the village.
</P>
<P>
The IDF early Sunday morning blew up a house, where the clash

Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Sunday also ordered the
Palestinian security to investigate the event.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami on Sunday termed
the event a very serious one, but he did not ask the Palestinian
side to extradite Abu Hanoud for trial.
</P>
<P>
Abu Hanoud has turned himself in to the Palestinian security
earlier Sunday at a hospital in Nablus, where he was reportedly
treated for three gun shots on his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
The IDF had recently carried out several manhunts of the "
Palestinian terrorists" in the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Israeli PM Says Negotiation Ball Now in the Palestinians' Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said Sunday that in terms of the negotiations with the
Palestinians, the ball is now in Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's
court.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Sunday morning's weekly cabinet meeting, Barak
stressed that it should be the Palestinians who will decide whether
or not to move toward a peace deal, according to a statement issued
by his office.
</P>
<P>
If Arafat decides not to renew efforts, the statement added, he
must then "bear the responsibility for the deadlock which is liable
to be created."
</P>
<P>
The most recent peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians
at the Camp David of the U.S. last month failed to reach an
agreement over core final-status issues to pave the way for a
permanent peace deal by September 13.
</P>
<P>
Amid lower level talks between the two sides, Israeli and
Palestinian leaders launched an international campaign respectively
to explicate their stands on the talks.
</P>
<P>
Barak claimed Sunday that in such diplomatic contacts, most of
the world understands that the ball is in Arafat's court.
</P>
<P>
"This is a tangible sign of both Israel's diplomatic achievement
and the turnaround in our international position," Barak said.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes the coming few weeks will be crucial for the
peace process as Arafat makes a decision. The two leaders are all
scheduled to meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton at the United
Nations millennium summit in New York next month.
</P>
<P>
Barak accused the Palestinians of adopting an uncompromising
position regarding the talks, saying that "while only one side is
necessary to force a confrontation, an agreement requires both
sides."
</P>
<P>
The status of Jerusalem, housing holy sites to Jews, Muslims and
Christians, is the sticking point in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel, which seized the Arab East Jerusalem from Jordan in the
1967 Mideast war and annexed it later, declared the whole city as
its "undivided and eternal capital" while the Palestinians want the
east part as the capital of their future state.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Palestinian Legislative Council Speaker and chief
negotiator Ahmed Qurei (Abu Ala) told the Voice of Palestine radio
that no Israeli-Palestinian deal is possible unless Israel promises
a full withdrawal from East Jerusalem and all the occupied
territories.
</P>
<P>
On peace talks with Syria, Barak said Sunday that he had told
French President Jacques Chirac during a telephone contact Saturday
night that Israel had made a strategic choice for peace with Syria
and believes that an agreement must honor both sides' interests and
rights.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister added that from his point-of-view, the door
is still open to negotiations with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks had been in stalemate since January due
to the two sides failed to bridge their differences over the return
of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.

from 1978 till May, will see the first election in 22 years.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry says that 2.75 million Lebanese have
registered to vote in the elections.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese army, in charge of security for the poll, had
mobilized some 10,000 troops since Saturday evening. Some 7,000
paramilitary police patrol at polling stations. Interior Minister
Michel Al-Murr said on Sunday morning that all process of the
voting went in order and no violence incident was reported.
</P>
<P>
Three Christian parties have called for boycott to the polls to
protest against the Syrian presence. Many Lebanese believe that
Syria, which is regarded as the main power broker of Lebanon and
deploys 35,000 troops in the country, has ordained the result
through the influence on the government.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon is one of the few countries in the world whose elections
are run on sectarian lines, with the 128 seats divided equally
among Muslims and Christians and then further sub-divided between
each of the 18 recognized religious sects.
</P>
<P>
According to Lebanese law, the current government will resign
after the formation of the new parliament. The president will
nominate a prime minister who has to be approved by the parliament.
Then the prime minister will forge a new government in a month.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Coast Guards Recover 8 Bodies From Capsized Boat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkish coast guards have
recovered eight bodies from a capsized Turkish boat that sank
Saturday night in the Aegean Sea, Anatolia News Agency reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The boat, setting out from Turkish Bodrum township of Mugla
province in Aegean region to Greek Kos Island, was carrying 32
illegal immigrants as it sank off Bodrum shortly after midnight.
</P>
<P>
The coast guards had rescued six people including the Turkish
skipper, but the other 18 are missing.
</P>
<P>
Turkish and Greek coast guard assisted by a helicopter are still
continuing the search, but rescue efforts were made difficult by
strong winds and rough waters, the agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Bodrum township chief Cumhur Guven Tasbasi said there were 18
Iraqis, five Afghans, eight Iranians and a woman whose nationality
was unknown aboard the ill-fated boat.
</P>
<P>
Three of the six rescued people have been taken to the state
hospital of Bodrum township for treatment.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old skipper, Tevrat Yanik, confessed that he charged
1,000 U.S. dollars each for smuggling them to Kos Island.
</P>
<P>
He said a fighting sparked by a squabble among the illegal
immigrants aboard overturned the boat.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Turkish security forces intercepted 42 foreigners in
Bodrum as they were trying to proceed to Greece illegally. They
were taken into custody for violating Turkish borders and passport
law.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is a commercial and cultural bridge between Europe and
Asia because of its geographical position. Many illegal immigrants
attempt to enter European countries via Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Urges International Community to Do More on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
Sunday called on the international community to exert effective
influence in order to pave the way for substantive negotiations on
the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Clerides made the call at an inauguration ceremony, held in Kato
Pyrgos, in the southwestern Paphos district of the island, for a
bust of two fighters in the battle against British colonial rule in
the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
He said freedom, justice, peace and security must be restored in
Cyprus, which would contribute to regional stability, security and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Cyprus issue, Clerides stressed that the Greek
Cypriot side is determined to carry on working for a settlement on
the island.
</P>
<P>
He said a peaceful resolution of the Cyprus issue needs the
political will of the other side, but there is no indication that
the position of the Turkish Cypriot side is shifting.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island in the wake of an abortive coup
supporting union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Three rounds of U.N.-sponsored proximity talks on Cyprus over
the past 10 months have not produced any tangible results so far.
There was no substantive negotiation as the Turkish Cypriot side
insists on recognition of the breakaway state in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
So far the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides outlined and
clarified their positions to the U.N. during the proximity talks.
</P>
<P>
The fourth round of talks are scheduled to start on September 12
in New York.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said that this time the world community should exert
effective influence to open the way towards substantive
negotiations within the framework of U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the Greek government for its "invaluable
contribution" to efforts to solve the Cyprus issue, to help Cyprus
in its European Union accession bid and to enhance Cyprus defense
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Clerides will leave on September 1 for London and then New York,
to attend the U.N. Millennium Summit and participate in the fourth
round of Cyprus talks.

<HEADLINE> Iran Claims Dozens MKO Members Killed and Injured in Border Clash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran claimed on Sunday that its
army had killed and injured dozens of members of the Iraq-based
Iranian military opposition group Mujaheddin Khalq Organization
(MKO) in border clashes on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
No specific figures were given. The state television quoted a
military source as saying that government troops repelled MKO
attacks and forced the rebels flee, leaving behind two Katyusha
launchers and many armaments including grenades and guns.
</P>
<P>
The MKO members had been trying to cross into Iran near the city
of Meymeh in the western border province of Ilam, the unnamed
source said. On the government side, three soldiers were killed
after the rebels fired mortar shells.
</P>
<P>
The MKO, a famous political-military group which fought against
the former shah's regime, was outlawed in 1981 and fled into Iraq
following sharp differences with the clerics brought to power by
the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Labeled by Tehran as a "terrorist group," the group has launched
a slew of attacks inside Iran in recent years, including the
assassination of senior government officials.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Turkmenistan Stress Cooperation in Solving Caspian Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Turkmenistan stressed on
Sunday that littoral states of the Caspian Sea should cooperate to
find a multilateral arrangement for exploiting and using the
resources in the area.
</P>
<P>
Any decision regarding the Caspian issue should be comprehensive
and uniform, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi told Boris
Shikhmyradov, the special envoy of Turkmen president.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi stressed that the five littoral states must find a
legal regime regarding the Caspian resources through cooperation
and coordination and avoid any unilateral actions, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Shikhmyradov also rejected unilateral actions, saying any move
regarding the Caspian has to be multilateral, transparent,
equitable and decisive.
</P>
<P>
The five littoral states of the Caspian Sea are Iran, Russia,
Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. The five have long called
for a legal regime to govern the Caspian, which has high potentials
in oil and gas reserves, navigation and fishery.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1921 and 1940 agreements between Iran and the
former Soviet Union, the land-locked sea could be exploited
jointly. But after the Soviet Union broke up, newly independent
republics -- Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan -- are seeking
a new legal status on the sea.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Iran said it was ready to accept a complete
division of the Caspian among its five littoral states, with Iran
having a 20-percent share. But the five countries still need
further negotiations to reach a final consensus on the issue.
</P>
<P>
At Sunday's meeting, Kharrazi and Shikhmyradov also expressed
their common concern over the continuing conflict in Afghanistan,
calling for all necessary measures to end the bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
The Turkmen official arrived here Sunday. He is also to visit
Afghanistan and Pakistan, IRNA said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Population Reaches 65 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's population reached 65.205
million at the start of 2000, indicating a growth rate of 2.02
percent in 1999, according to census results announced on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
One baby was born every 24.4 seconds on average during the past
three years in the country, Director of Egypt's Central Agency of
Public Mobilization and Statistics Ihab Elawi told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
He said the growth rate in 1999 was lower than that in the
previous year, when it stood at 2.09 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government wants to lower the population growth rate to
below 2 percent, but efforts to control the birth rate were
neutralized by the fact that death rates were also falling.
</P>
<P>
The authorities' efforts have also been hindered by a widespread
belief that contraception is not accepted by the Muslim religion.
</P>
<P>
Elawi also said the census showed 1.9 million Egyptians, or 2.9
percent of the population, are working abroad, mainly in the Gulf
states.
</P>
<P>
It is forecast that the population could reach 123 million by
2029. More than half the population is concentrated in 5 percent of
the land space in this largely desert country.

<P>
CAIRO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- On the heels of the World Bank, the Japan Bank for
International Cooperation (JBIC) has also suspended a loan of
nearly 750 million U.S. dollars, which is to be extended to Turkey
on financial adjustment, reported Anatolia News Agency on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Sources said JBIC was waiting for the arrangement of
privatization in public banks before it would release the loan in
line with the policy of the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank announced earlier this month that it would
release the 750-million-dollar loan on financial sector adjustment
following the finalization of the privatization plan on public
banks. It wants the legal arrangements for privatizing public banks
to be presented as a package.
</P>
<P>
JBIC officials paid a fact-finding visit to Turkey in June and
got information on the country's financial sector.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran will build a steel plant for Kuwait in line with
its economic policy of cooperating with neighboring countries in
industrial projects, said Minister of Mines and Metals Eshaq
Jahangiri on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The steel project, with the cooperation of Kuwait, will be the
first Iranian-built industrial plant abroad, Jahangiri was quoted
by the Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He added that the steel complex will come on stream by the end
of the next Iranian year which starts March 21, 2001.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The exports value of fresh fruits and vegetables from
the Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP) region in the first seven
months of 2000 rose to 15 million U.S. dollars, up by 30.9 percent
from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
In the same period of last year, the region, which consists
eight provinces, exported 11 million dollars of fresh fruits and
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Southeastern Anatolia Exporters' Union told
reporters on Sunday that the majority of the goods had gone to the
Middle East and European Union countries.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran's National Petrochemical Company (NPC) is seeking
to increase its ethylene production to 5 million tons a year,
Deputy Oil Minister for Petrochemical Affairs Mohammad Reza
Nematzadeh said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that domestic ethylene production would reach
3.5 to 4 million tons a year by the end of the third five-year
economic development plan (2000-2005). The figure will finally
reach 5 million tons given the potential of the petrochemical
industry, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran's total petrochemical output would rise to 38
million tons by the end of the third plan in light of a three-
phased project, launched by the NPC since 1997 to develop the
country's petrochemical industry.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Not to Compromise Arab Identity in Working for Peace: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said on Sunday that Cairo will not compromise its Arab and
Islamic identity in working for peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the remark while speaking to reporters about the
coming visit to Egypt by U.S. President Bill Clinton on Tuesday. He
said Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Clinton would brief each
other on their ideas on how to narrow gaps between the Palestinians
and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Egypt would not lose sight of Arab and Islamic concerns, such as
the status of Jerusalem, the minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is an Arab and Islamic state and does not belong to any
other region, Moussa said, adding that it cannot detach itself from
the reality in which it lives.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has an important role to play for peace and stability and
security in the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
Moussa and Mubarak have repeatedly said Egypt will not pressure
the Palestinians to accept any proposals for peace with Israel that
do not meet the Palestinian people's demands.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Clinton's visit was "very important" because it will
decide, or help decide, a number of matters related to the Mideast
peace process.
</P>
<P>
He did not rule out the possibility that a Palestinian-Israeli
peace agreement could be reached before the end of the year. But he
underlined that this depends on the appreciation of all the
parties, especially Israel, for the benefits peace could bring in
terms of security, regional integration and end of conflict.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is due in Egypt early Tuesday for a brief stopover on
his way home from visits to Nigeria and Tanzania.

DAMASCUS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk
Shareh left here on Sunday for Paris for talks with French
officials on the Middle East peace process in the wake of last
month's failed Camp David peace summit.
</P>
<P>
Shareh will deliver a message from Syrian President Bashar al-
Assad to his French counterpart Jacques Chirac on the situation in
the Middle East and the latest developments of the regional peace
process as well as the Syrian-French ties.
</P>
<P>
France is currently holding the rotating presidency of the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
Shareh will also hold talks with French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine on the peace talks on the Syrian and Palestinian tracks,
and ways of reviving the stalled Syrian-Israeli peace talks in the
light of recent contacts between U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, Shareh and some other Arab foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Administration has been making intensive contacts with
Syria to probe the possibility of settling the dispute over a strip
of the eastern shore of Sea of Galilee between Syria and Israel,
said diplomatic sources.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has proposed to internationalize the area, Syria
rejects a resumption of talks with Israel without an Israeli pledge
to withdraw to the borders before the 1967 Middle East war,
including the strip of shore of the lake.
</P>
<P>
During a recent contact with Shareh, Albright expressed interest
in resuming the Syrian-Israeli peace talks. There is a chance to
revive the talks during the coming two months, she said.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers agreed to meet on the sidelines of the
U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York next month.
</P>
<P>
Shareh is expected to leave for Morocco after the visit to
attend a meeting of the Jerusalem Committee of the Organization of
the Islamic Conference.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, to be held on Tuesday, will be chaired by Moroccan
King Mohammed VI with a view to adopting a unified Arab position on

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Celebrate OPEC Founding Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraq will hold celebrations next
month to mark the 40th anniversary of the founding of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the official
Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A source from the Iraqi oil ministry said that Iraq has been
preparing "magnificent" ceremony for the event. OPEC was
established in the Iraqi capital Baghdad on September 14, 1960.
</P>
<P>
The celebrations will start from September 11 and last for about
two weeks to greet the forthcoming OPEC summit meeting to be held
in the Venezuelan capital Caracas, the source said. Iraq will also
participate in the celebrations in Caracas for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
On that occasion, Iraq will present folklore and fashion shows,
music, an exhibition of antiques and books concerning Iraq's
religion and scenic spots.
</P>
<P>
A number of officials from the ministries of foreign affairs,
finance, cultural and information will be present at the Caracas
celebrations, said the source.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral relations between Iraq and Venezuela have
witnessed a big step forward after Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
visited the country on August 10, the first such visit by a head of
state since the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Chavez toured Iraq and other nine members of OPEC to invite all
OPEC members to attend the summit meeting in Caracas next month.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela and Iraq are both sponsor nations of OPEC. On
September 10, 1960, representatives from Iraq, Venezuela, Iran,
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait held a meeting in Baghdad to safeguard the
oil prices. Four days later, they announced the founding of the
world's biggest oil cartel.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Military Operation in Palestinian Village Condemned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official Sunday
denounced the Israeli military operation in a West Bank village
Saturday night as a "heinous act."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) condemned the operation
which took place at a time when negotiations were being held
between the Palestinians and Israel, said Speaker of the
Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) Ahmed Qurei (also known as
Abu Ala).
</P>
<P>
Three Israeli soldiers were killed in a shootout when hundreds
of Israeli soldiers stormed the Palestinian village of Assira
Ashamalieh near Nablus, which is believed to be one of the
strongholds of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement, or
Hamas.
</P>
<P>
During the clashes, Mahmoud Abu Hanoud, the number one fugitive
on Israel's most-wanted list, was also wounded. But he escaped from
the house besieged by the IDF in Nablus and gave himself up to the
Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli authorities said that the three soldiers "
were killed by friendly fire" and investigations are still
underway.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a statement by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
that the Israeli General Security Services might ask the PNA to
hand over Hanoud, West Bank Preventive Security Commander Gebril
al-Ragoub said the Palestinian side would never yield to Israel's
pressure.
</P>
<P>
He added that Israel had to coordinate with the Palestinian
security forces before carrying out its military operation in the
village, which is under Palestinian civilian administration but
under Israeli security control.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by three helicopters, the IDF besieged the village
at midnight in a bid to arrest Hanoud, who was accused of being
behind two anti-Israeli suicide bombings in Jerusalem in 1997,
killing and injuring 21 Israelis. The IDF early Sunday morning blew
up a house where the clash with Hamas militants took place.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Rejects Israeli Sovereignty over Jerusalem: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Ali Abu Ragheb said
here Sunday that Jordan firmly rejects any form of Israeli
sovereignty over Jerusalem, and the kingdom's interests must be
protected in the final status peace talks between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Ragheb told a press conference that Jordan has never presented
any different suggestions on the future status of Jerusalem, and it
is persistent in its support for the establishment of a Palestinian
state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war
and later annexed it, and declared Jerusalem as its eternal and
indivisible capital, which is not recognized internationally.
</P>
<P>
The future of the holy city is one of the thorniest issues in
the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks which also focused on the
return of Palestinian refugees, water, borders and security
arrangements between Israel and a future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Ragheb said Jordan is, and will continue to be, one of the basic
pillars of peace process in the region, but no peace solutions can
ignore Jordan's interests, particularly on the Palestinian refugees
issue.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is hosting some 1.5 million Palestinian refugees, most of
whom had been given Jordanian citizenship. But the government said
it does not mean they had given up their rights to return home or
stay in Jordan while asking for compensations from parties
concerned.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has direct interest in the ongoing final status
negotiations between the Palestinians and Israel, and has been
well-informed about what is going on concerning the refugee issue,
Ragheb said.
</P>
<P>
Israel, the Palestinians, and the United States had confirmed to
Jordan that it would be involved in the interpretation of the
status of Palestinian refugees, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said Jordan's position on the refugee issue is based on the
U.N. Security Council Resolution 194, which stipulates the right of
return and compensation, and the kingdom has relayed this position
in written forms to Palestinian and Israeli negotiators.
</P>
<P>
The U.N., the U.S. and the European Union have also been
informed of the Jordanian stand, he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the U.S. role as a major broker in the peace
process, Ragheb said "We have good relations with America
particularly on the political and economic levels, and we believe
that the U.S. is a partner to Jordan in all areas."
</P>
<P>
Washington takes Jordan, which signed a peace treaty with Israel
in 1994, as an ally in the Arab world, and provided some 300
million U.S. dollars in various economic and military aid packages
to the kingdom in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Records 6.9 Percent GDP Growth in First Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka recorded a 6.9 percent
growth rate in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) terms during the first
half of this year due to buoyant exports, according to provisional
estimates.
</P>
<P>
"The annual growth rate appears to be somewhat higher than the
original estimate of 5.5 percent of the Central Bank. It is now
estimated to be in the region of six percent," a highly placed
Central Bank source was quoted as saying by the Sunday Observer
here.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka experienced a 4.3 percent GDP growth rate in 1999.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of this year, overall export earnings
recorded 2,464 million dollars, an increase of 19.67 percent over
the corresponding period last year, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
It said earnings from garment exports increased by 24 percent
to 1.322 billion dollars, which was attributed to the robust
economic growth of the United States which is the main buyer of
Sri Lanka's garments.
</P>
<P>
As a result of a boom in oil prices, Sri Lanka's black tea
prices experienced an upward trend, due to increased demand from
the Russian and Middle Eastern markets. Earnings from tea exports
appreciated from 297 million dollars to 327 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, Sri Lanka's import bill for the first half of this
year increased by nearly 1 billion dollars compared with last year
to 3.603 billion dollars, contributing to a trade deficit of 1.139
billion dollars, as against 549 million dollars last year.

<HEADLINE> 2nd lead: Abu Sayyaf Frees 5 Foreign Hostages in Philippines (part 1) EDS: Updates With Details, Background </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Abu Sayyaf Sunday afternoon
released five foreign hostages including four seized from Malaysia
and kept them captive for more than four months in its jungle lair
in the southern Philippine island of Jolo.
</P>
<P>
The freed four women and one man arrived by helicopter at the
Edwin Andrews air base in Zamboanga, a port city near Jolo, at
around 6 p.m., under the escort of Philippine government chief
negotiator Robert Aventajado and Libyan envoy Rajab Azzarouq, the
ABS-CBN TV station reported.
</P>
<P>
They were met at the air base by ambassadors or envoys of their
countries and their relatives who had been waiting there in
anxious anticipation of their arrival.
</P>
<P>
Expectations ran high earlier in the day that the Abu Sayyaf
would free six, or half of the 12 foreign hostages in its hands.
The sixth hostage expected to be released is a Finnish national.
</P>
<P>
The five released Sunday include one French woman, one Lebanese-
French woman, one South African woman and one German man who were
among the original group of 21 hostages kidnapped by the Abu
Sayyaf from Malaysia's resort island of Sipadan on April 23.
</P>
<P>
And the fifth is a French woman who was one of the three
members of a French TV crew seized in Jolo last month while
covering the hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
They will be brought to the central city of Cebu and a
chartered Libyan plane, which has been waiting there since
Saturday last week,will then fly them to the Libyan capital of
Tripoli, where they will be met by their relatives and
representatives of their countries.
</P>
<P>
It has been widely reported that Libya had agreed to pay 1
million U.S. dollars each for the 12 foreign hostages in addition
to an earlier offer of 25 million dollars in ransom to the Abu
Sayyaf for the release of its hostages. But both Tripoli and
Manila have denied that they paid any ransoms. Libya said its
funds were for livelihood projects for Muslim areas in Mindanao,
the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf is still holding the remaining six hostages of
the Sipadan group -- two Finns, one German, one French, one South
African and one Filipino.
</P>
<P>
It is also keeping captive two members of the French TV crew
and 12 local Christian evangelists who paid their way into the
rebel lair to pray for the hostages last month.

</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf reportedly promised Saturday to free six foreign
hostages Sunday after getting assurance from a government emissary
that two of its members who were arrested in Zamboanga Thursday
were released on bail.
</P>
<P>
The rebel group threatened Friday to kill two captives and not
to release any hostage unless police release the two men, who were
arrested when they were trying to exchange 240,000 U.S. dollars
worth of alleged ransom money into pesos at a bank in Zamboanga.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf had earlier released nine Malaysians, one German
woman and one Filipino woman of the Sipadan group and one German
and two Filipino journalists who were seized in Jolo.
</P>
<P>
The group has amassed at least 5.5 million dollars in ransoms
paid for the release of their captives, according to military
officials. But the governments of the Philippines and related
countries have repeatedly stated that they had paid no ransom for
the release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada expressed happiness over
the release of the five foreign hostages Sunday, and he hopes that
the remaining seven foreigners would be freed next week.
</P>
<P>
Estrada reiterated Friday that the safety of the hostages
remains his administration's top priority, saying that is why "it
is taking us a long time to work for their release."
</P>
<P>
He made the statement in response to a call by three European
leaders on the Philippine government not to use force to end the
hostage crisis, which has entered its fifth month.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Estrada dated August 22, which was made public
Friday, Finnish President Tarja Halonen, French President Jacques
Chirac and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said, "The safety
of the hostages may not be undermined by any use of force."
</P>
<P>
They also expressed concern over delays in the release of their
nationals held hostage by the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday last week, the rebels reneged on an agreement with
government negotiators to release all its hostages in one go,
alleging that the military was preparing an offensive against them.

<HEADLINE> 20 Killed, Scores Injured in Incidents in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- At least 20 people were killed and
scores injured in Bangladesh Sunday in two separate incidents, one
fire incident in a garment factory and the other a roof collapse,
police and fire brigade sources said.
</P>
<P>
At least 12 people including 10 female workers were killed in a
pre-dawn fire at a clothing factory in Dhaka, most of whom died of
smoke inhalation, and dozens of workers were injured.
</P>
<P>
The victims were working the overnight shift on the ground
floor of the Globe Netting Garment Factory in the Banani
commercial district in the capital city, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the incident is not yet known and the
investigation is under way, they said.
</P>
<P>
In another incident which happened Sunday in Chittagong, the
largest port city of the country, at least eight construction
workers were killed and 13 injured as the roof of a half-built
warehouse collapsed, police said.
</P>
<P>
About 100 people were working at the site when the roof fell in,
Deputy Commissioner of Police in Chittagong Aminul Islam told
Xinhua over phone.
</P>
<P>
"Eight bodies have been retrieved from the debris and 13
workers have been sent to hospital," he said, adding that more
people could be trapped under the debris.
</P>
<P>
It has become a familiar story that scores of Bangladeshi
garment workers, mainly female, die in fires annually and many
more are fatally injured.
</P>
<P>
There are around 2,500 garment factories in the country which
employ 1.4 million workers, 90 percent of whom are women.
</P>
<P>
Sources said safety provisions in almost all the factories are
absent and faulty. Fire incidents and machine and electrical
hazards are rampant in the garment units.
</P>
<P>
Most of the fired in garment factories occur due to short
circuits, fire brigade officials said.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 27 (Xinhua) -- There will be more
interaction especially between the younger leaders of Malaysia and
Singapore,Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said the ruling party UMNO (United Malays National
Organization)Youth leader Hishammuddin Hussein would lead a
delegation to meet Singapore's ruling party youth leaders soon.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian MPs will be going to Singapore and there will be a
lot of interaction and movements from both sides,he told reporters
after a golf session with his Singapore counterpart,S. Jayakumar,
here.
</P>
<P>
The visit by the Malaysian MPs to Singapore is a very positive
indication which augurs well for better ties between the two
neighbors after several years of strained relationships, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is a sense of openness and frankness and a very clear
intention and desire to develop our future relationship by not
looking at the past but to move forward," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said both countries should take advantage of the "mood"
created by the recent visit of Singapore's Senior Minister Lee
Kuan Yew who expressed the need for improved bilateral ties and
solving all outstanding issues such as a new water supply
agreement, development of Malayan railways land in Singapore and
the Malaysian customs checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
Agreeing to Syed Hamid's views, Jayakumar said improvement in
bilateral relations required more closer interaction not only at
the political level but also in other areas such as between civil
servants and the private sectors of the two countries.

<P>
MANILA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada confirmed Sunday afternoon that he is softening the
government's "all or nothing" stance on the Sulu hostage crisis
following the release of five foreign hostages by the Abu Sayyaf
earlier on the day.
</P>
<P>
Estrada told reporters that appeals from European envoys to
ease the government position in dealing with the Abu Sayyaf rebels
prompted this decision.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf Sunday afternoon set free five foreign hostages,
including four women, from its jungle lair in the Jolo island in
the southern province of Sulu.
</P>
<P>
The five comprise four of the original group of 21 hostages
kidnapped by the Abu Sayyaf from Malaysia's resort island of
Sipadan on April 23 and one journalist abducted in Jolo last month
while covering the hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday last week, the Abu Sayyaf rebels reneged on an
agreement to release all of its hostages in one go, alleging that
the military was preparing an offensive against them. They offered
to free two Europeans, but negotiators rejected the offer in line
with Estrada's "all or nothing policy."
</P>

foreigners would be freed in a week's time.

the Sipadan group -- two Finns, one German, one French, one South
African and one Filipino -- and two French journalists and 12
local Christian evangelists seized in Jolo last month.
</P>
<P>
The only male hostage released Sunday, German national Werner
Walert, said he is not entirely happy because not all hostages
were freed. His son Marc remains with the Abu Sayyaf rebels.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada explained that the hostage crisis dragged on
because his administration wants to ensure the welfare of the
hostages.

<HEADLINE> Singaporeans Urged to Pursue Lifelong Learning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime
Minister Lee Hsien Loong Sunday urged Singaporeans to pursue
lifelong learning as a survival strategy and continuously upgrade
their skills with an aim to make a difference to their lives in
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"The challenge is not just creating employment or jobs, but
ensuring employability -- equipping our workers with the skills to
do the new jobs which are available, and to adapt to new working
conditions in high growth sectors," Lee said while launching the
2000 Singapore Learning Festival.
</P>
<P>
The festival features 250 learning activities with the
objectives of raising public awareness of and interest in lifelong
learning, promoting a national approach to this task and
showcasing the diversity of available learning opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Lee noted that restructuring in business everywhere forces
workers to learn and find new jobs or be retrenched and become
structurally unemployed.
</P>
<P>
Underlining the urgency of the task of training and retraining
workers, Lee said, "Unless our workers pick up new skills, they
will lose out even though new job opportunities are being created.
"
</P>
<P>
Currently, only one-third of the existing workforce is skilled
in Singapore and another third is semi-skilled while the rest is
unskilled. In the first half of this year, 44,500 new jobs were
created against 7,800 workers laid off, but the June unemployment
rate stood at 3.5 percent, failing to go down as companies had
difficulties to find skilled workers to fill their vacancies.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister said his government will do all it
can to help workers, citing that the government has used the Skill
Development Fund to support training programs for workers,
collaborated with the National Trades Union Congress to fund the
Skills Redevelopment Programs and set up a 5 billion Singapore
dollars Lifelong Learning Fund, which Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong announced last week to provide significant resources to
support programs for workers.
</P>
<P>
Noting that 57 percent of Singapore's workforce has not engaged
in any training in the last three years, Lee stressed that workers
must understand that training and learning will be continuing
priority throughout their working lives and they need to adopt a
more flexible mindset, accept new work conditions and undergo
retraining for new jobs.
</P>
<P>
He also urged companies to see training and development of
their employees as a strategic investment in their innovation
capacities.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Parties Geared Up for Nominations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- All political parties in Sri
Lanka are geared up to submit their nominations beginning Monday
for the forthcoming elections in the country, a senior election
official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Election Commissioner K. Senanayake said nominations
will be received from Monday until September 4 at 22 district
secretariats islandwide.
</P>
<P>
He said security will be tightened in and around the
secretariats and he asked the politicians not to bring large
crowds when they present their nominations.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's 45 recognized political parties and several
independent groups have indicated that they will contest the 11th
parliamentary general elections to be held on October 10.
</P>
<P>
Some 12 million voters are to cast their votes at more than 10,
000 polling booths to elect 225 representatives to the next
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Elections Department has identified the necessary personnel
of more than 90,000 to man all polling booths and counting centers
and is in the process of making all logistical arrangements for
the polls.
</P>
<P>
Already three people respectively from the ruling People's
Alliance (PA) and the main opposition United National Party (UNP)
and the left-wing People's Liberation Front have been killed in
pre-nominations violence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PA and the UNP have been busy cutting deals with
smaller parties ahead of the nominations on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Five of the eight parliamentarians of the Ceylon Workers
Congress (CWC), a key ally of President Chandrika Kumaratunga's PA
government, defected to the main opposition UNP on Friday. The CWC
split obviously weakened the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
The PA faced another setback Sunday before the nominations when
one of its key allies, Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC), decided
to contest alone under the name of National United Alliance.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the SLMC, Minister M.H.M. Ashraff, is involved in
a battle with a fellow minister belonging to the Sri Lanka Freedom
party, a main constituent party of the PA.
</P>
<P>
However, in a move to consolidate its majority Sinhala-Buddhist
vote base, the PA on Friday entered into alliance with the MEP or
People's United Front, a hard-line Sinhala nationalist party, to
contest the general elections.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Agricultural Output to Decline This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's agriculture sector is
expected to decline by 4.2 percent in real terms in 2000, compared
to a growth rate of 1.9 percent in 1999, Zimbabwe Financial
Holdings (Finhold), the country's main financial institution said
in a report released here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the production of crops such as wheat, cotton,
soybeans, coffee and horticulture was caused by heavy flooding
associated with Cyclone Eline, shortages of fuel and foreign
currency and the disruption to farming activities due to the
occupation of white-owned farms by the war veterans, Finhold said.
</P>
<P>
"The acquisition of some commercial farms by the government for
resettlement purposes in the maize growing belt is likely to
result in a reduction in areas under maize," said Finhold in a
review of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
During the 2000/2001 season production of flue-cured tobacco
was likely to decline by about 20 percent due to inadequate land
preparation, shortage of fuel and low tobacco prices, it said.
</P>
<P>
Horticultural exports were affected by the continued management
of the exchange rate in the greater part of the year, but growth
in exports were likely to improve now because of the devaluation
of the Zimbabwean dollar by 25 percent this month.

Officials of Western Kenya Human Rights Watch (WKHRW) and the

<HEADLINE> Feature: Somali National Flag -- Symbol of Somali Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Djibouti, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Everybody cherishes the
national flag of his motherland because it represents the nation
he belongs to. For the Somalis, however, their national flag,
which is sky-blue color with a white five-pointed star in the
middle, has much more meaning than people in other parts of the
world think.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's inauguration of Somali President Abdiqasim Salad
Hassan in Arta, some 45 kilometers away from the capital of
Djibouti, was in some sense also a ceremony that marked the Somali
national flag's return to its motherland.
</P>
<P>
As part of the inauguration ceremony, Djibouti President Ismael
Omar Guelleh, sponsor and host of the months-long Somali Peace
Conference, presented solemnly the Somali national flag to Salad,
who then transferred it to Somali guards of honor in the same way.
</P>
<P>
"We actually come to Djibouti to get our national flag back to
Somalia," Dahir Gabil Shire, a colonel during the rule of the
deposed Mohamed Sirad Barre, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Dahir is the chief of a 13-member Somali guard of honor at the
ceremony. All these guards were officers in the Sirad regime.
</P>
<P>
"We are very happy and proud to serve for the new government of
Somalia because our motherland is to escape from the civil war
under this government ," said another colonel Ali Noor.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Somali participants of the ceremony were so proud
of their national flag that they put the national symbol where
ever possible -- holding in their hands, hanging on the pillars,
printing on their helmets and draping over their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
That is why the scene of the ceremony, which occupied about one
square kilometer, was described by some participants as a sea of
Somali national flags.
</P>
<P>
In addition to their national flag, the Somali participants
were also bearing in mind constantly their national anthem that
had been sung by the people ever since the country won its
independence from the British rule in 1960.
</P>
<P>
All this shows that the Somalis, who have been here holding a
peace conference since May, are doing their best to resume their
dreamed and idealized Somalia which should be a peaceful and
reconciled country.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The West Side Boys, a rebel group
in Sierra Leone, has put forward a number of conditions for the
release of 11 British soldiers abducted by them, said a report
reaching here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A senior Sierra Leonean government official was quoted as
saying in the capital Freetown that the rebels had reportedly
asked for food, medicine and the release of one of their leaders
from the government's prison.
</P>
<P>
The concerned prisoner, known variously as Bomb Blast or
General Papa, had been detained in the central prison in Freetown
for almost two months, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The British soldiers, who had been serving under the British
training team in Sierra Leone, were reportedly taken hostage by
the rebel group on Friday when they were patrolling along the
Freetown-Masiaka highway.
</P>
<P>
Since the abduction, the United Nations mission in Sierra Leone
has been in contact with the rebels in an attempt to secure the
safe release of the soldiers, who are reportedly "in good
condition".
</P>
<P>
It is not yet known whether the Sierra Leonean government would
meet the rebels' demands for the release of the British soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pledges Most Favorable Trade Treatment for Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- U. S. President Bill Clinton
Sunday pledged inflow of American investment and tariff cuts for
Nigerian products at a business forum during his second-day visit
to the West African country.
</P>
<P>
Some categories of products originated from Nigeria will enter
the U.S. market duty free, making the country enjoy the most
favorable trade treatment in the world except some South American
countries, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"The road has been laid by the two governments, but the cars
have to be made by the business sectors," he told the party
attended by VIPs from both Nigerian and American business sectors.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his pledge that the U.S. government would do its
part to help reduce Nigeria's debts, and urged Nigerian
businessmen to make sure that the benefit from the debt relief
will add to the country's economic recovery in the long-run.
</P>
<P>
He also urged Nigerians to take advantage of the information
technology and put more emphasis on education.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived here Saturday morning for a two-day official
visit to the most populous country in Africa.
</P>
<P>
It's the second official visit by an American president, after
Jimmy Carter's 20 years ago. It is also Clinton' s second trip to
Africa after his last one to Ghana and Botswana in 1998.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Clinton held talks with President Olusegun
Obasanjo several times and addressed a joint session of the
National Assembly, the country's top legislature, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton visited a village in the suburbs of the capital Sunday

attending the business forum late afternoon.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vows to Support Nigeria's Fight Against HIV/AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton has pledged to provide 10 million U.S. dollars to Nigeria
this year in support of its fight against HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a forum on "United States and Nigeria: Jointing
Forces Against AIDS" in the capital Abuja on Sunday, Clinton said
the grant is three times bigger compared to what the United Sates
provided for the same purpose last year.
</P>
<P>
The United States would also provide 9 million dollars in
support of Nigeria's fight to eradicate polio and 2 million
dollars to help protect Nigerian children from Malaria through the
distribution of bed nets, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Parker Foundation of the United States would also
provide 35 million dollars in grants over the next five years to
improve reproductive health of Nigerian women.
</P>
<P>
The president further promised that the United States would
give Nigeria medicines, especially those that would prevent
transfer of AIDS from pregnant women to their babies. The
infectious diseases could drop in Nigeria and other African
countries just like it had done in America, he said.
</P>
<P>
It was unfortunate that 3 million Nigerians were already living
with AIDS, he said, calling for concerted actions to stop the
spread of the deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
"AIDS can rob a country of its future. I know you will not let
that happen to Nigeria," Clinton said, noting that the fight
against AIDS was not that of Nigeria alone but that of Africa,
America and the entire world.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived in Abuja on Saturday with a 1,000-strong
delegation for a two-day state visit to the most populous African
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton Sunday called on the Nigerian business community to
embrace economic reforms and privatization, describing them as the
key to development.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a business forum under the theme "Investing in
Nigeria's Future" in the capital Abuja, Clinton said Nigeria needs
to improve access to information technology in order to take
advantage of the benefits of the explosion in technology.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria needs to increase the number of its citizens having
access to the Internet to enable the country to take advantage of
the "collapse of time and distance" inherent in Internet
technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said one of the central themes of his visit to Nigeria is to
help the country reduce its foreign debt burden, which is
estimated at about 30 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Describing the United States and Nigeria as being in the same
boat, Clinton said "we are all in the same boat, so let us sail."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, arrived in Abuja on Saturday with a 1,000-strong
delegation for a two-day state visit to the most populous African
country, is scheduled to leave for Arusha, Tanzania on Monday to
witness the signing of a Burundi peace deal brokered by former

HARARE, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean exporters should be
prepared to fully take advantage of opportunities arising from
Free Trade Area (FTA) of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC), Industry and International Trade Minister
Nkosana Moyo said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Moyo made the remarks while opening the Confederation of
Zimbabwe Industries conference on the Southern African Development

</P>
<P>
The market had more than 190 million consumers with a
cumulative gross domestic product of more than 180 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Moyo said it was time for producers to consider expanding their
production lines to enable them supply a larger, competitive
market.
</P>
<P>
Ten members of the 14-member SADC will be implementing a FTA
and Tariff Reduction Program on September 1, 2000.

pounds (about 118 million U.S. dollars) to help the former Soviet
Union deal with nuclear safety issues, a foreign office official
said on Sunday.
</P>

The countries of the former Soviet Union face enormous nuclear
problems that affect the lives of us all and these problems need
to be urgently addressed by the whole international community,"
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a statement.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Three Elevators Fall at TV Tower in Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Three elevators in the Moscow
Ostankino TV tower, where fire broke out on Sunday afternoon, came
loose and fell at about 7.30 p.m. local time (17:30 GMT). The fate
of those on board was not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers are trying to pry open the fallen elevators' doors,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
However, the Itar-Tass news agency said that four people,
including three firemen and one female operator, were announced
missing.
</P>
<P>
The fallen elevators ignited a fire on the ground floor, Tass
said.
</P>
<P>
About 100 fire engines were working at the scene, trying to
contain the fire at the world's second tallest building, which has
knocked the country's major national television programs off the
air.
</P>
<P>
Many of the paging services, mobile communications, and radio
broadcast were also off the air in Moscow in the aftermath of the
fire.
</P>
<P>
The fire was allegedly caused by a short circuit at a
transmitter of a paging company. Many paging services have been
suspended.
</P>
<P>
The Ostankino TV and BC center, inaugurated in November 1967,
is the second tallest freestanding building in the world, just
after the one in Toronto, Canada.
</P>
<P>
Weighing more than 55,000 tons, the structure is 540 meters
tall. Visitors can reach the observation deck at 337 meters in 58
seconds by the elevator.
</P>
<P>
There are three dining rooms below the observation deck.

<HEADLINE> Nine Out of Ten Experts Complain of Tax bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- British tax experts are calling
on the government to launch an inquiry into the problems plaguing
the Inland Revenue and its self-assessment system.
</P>
<P>
A survey of 770 accountants showed that instances of incorrect
bills and wrong fines increased by up to 24 percent in June,
compared with the findings of a survey in February.
</P>
<P>
Almost nine out of the ten accountants, which carried out the
survey, said they had dealt with clients who had incorrectly been
accused of late filing of returns.
</P>
<P>
Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of taxation at the Association of
Chartered Certified Accountants, said that the problems stemmed
from poor management and chronic understaffing at the revenue
since the self-assessment system began three years ago.
</P>
<P>
He said: "There have been problems every year since self-
assessment was introduced but this year has been an extreme fiasco
because of the revenue's computer problems."
</P>
<P>
The survey found the greatest complaint was that revenue staff
did not receive sufficient training or support. Almost 90 percent
of those surveyed had to spend extra time on self-assessment forms
because of revenue failures or errors.

MOSCOW, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A fire that broke out Sunday
afternoon at the local Ostankino TV power is spreading to the
lower sections of the world's second tallest freestanding
structure amid reports of several people missing inside a jammed
elevator.
</P>
<P>
The fire, which broke out at a height of 475 meters, have
spread to the height of 280 meters and is moving to lower levels,
the Interfax news agency reported, quoting city fire brigade
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Almost all television programs and many radio broadcasts have
been knocked off the air. Mobile communications and paging
services were also affected.
</P>
<P>
To fill the information void created by the fire, the Itar-Tass
news agency started to provide what it described as open access to
all its information from its web site.
</P>
<P>
President Vladimir Putin summoned Minister of Communications
Leonid Reiman to the Kremlin and discussed the possibility of
using reserve channels to restore the TV broadcasting and secure
uninterrupted work of communication facilities, ambulance service,
the Interior Ministry and other services, the Kremlin press
service said.
</P>
<P>
The fire was allegedly caused by a short circuit at the
transmitter of a paging company, but the authorities have not
ruled out the possibility of sabotage.
</P>
<P>
After the outbreak of the fire, Moscow police received an
anonymous call that said a bomb had planted in the TV tower and
that it would explode shortly, Interfax reported, quoting a source
with law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers are continuing their efforts to free several people
trapped in a fallen elevator that was jammed somewhere in the
tower by emergency blocks.
</P>
<P>
The search team reached a height of 311 meters but could not
proceed further because of high concentration of smoke. The
elevator has not been located, and contact with those trapped
inside has been lost.
</P>
<P>
In addition to those stranded in the fallen elevator, three
people received medical attention because of the fire, Interfax
said.
</P>
<P>
A female TV crewmember was in a shock and two firemen were
slightly poisoned by monoxide fumes.
</P>
<P>
The Ostankino TV and BC center, inaugurated in November 1967,

<HEADLINE> Syrian FM Pessimistic About Resumption of Peace Process With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk
Shareh said here on Sunday that he is pessimistic about the
perspective of a resumption of peace process between his country
and Israel in near future.
</P>
<P>
In a statement made after a meeting with French President
Jacques Chirac, Shareh said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
missed an important chance to make peace with Syria a few months
ago.
</P>
<P>
He was apparently referring to the failure of the summit
meeting held in March in Geneva between U.S. President Bill
Clinton and the late President Hafez Assad of Syria.
</P>
<P>
"The situation of the Israeli government does not encourage the
realization of peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the problem of Jerusalem, Shareh said that Syria is opposed
to any "dealing" on the question of Arab sovereignty over
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Shareh also expressed his hope that France and European
countries will play an efficient role in pushing forward the
process for a just and global peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
France, which is the current rotating presidency state of the
European Union, has been encouraging both Syria and Israel to
resume their peace process, which has been suspended since January
mainly because of the refusal of Israel to pull out of the Golan
Heights it occupied in 1967.
</P>
<P>
Chirac had a long telephone conversation with Barak on Saturday
on the overall issues concerning the peace process in the Middle
East, said sources at the Elysee presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Interim Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben Ami is due to hold
talks with his French counterpart Hubert Vedrine on Monday in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an Israeli minister recently hinted that Israel
might pull out from Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin said last Wednesday
that Israel should withdraw from the Golan Heights, because it was
a territory occupied by Israel since 1967.

But Pinochet was allowed to return to Chile from Britain in
March after a 17-month legal battle concluded that he could not be

<HEADLINE> UK Seeks to Win Release of Soldiers Captive In Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We have made contact with those who appear to be holding the
men," a defense ministry spokesman said, adding that "discussions
are at a very early stage."
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman acknowledged that Britain was "working
closely with the government of Sierra Leone to try to bring this
to a conclusion."
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Defense said on Saturday that the leader of the
11-man British team, which was captured on Friday while patrolling
near Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, had been in contact
and said all were "being fed and well-treated."
</P>
<P>
"We have made contact with those who appear to be holding" the
men, a Defense Ministry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Reports here quoted a British force spokesman in Freetown as
saying that "efforts are still going on to secure their safe
release. Negotiations are going on."
</P>
<P>
Earlier in London, Defense Minister John Spellar said he was
quite optimistic about the release of the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
"Together with the Sierra Leonean government we will be working
very hard to resolve this," Spellar said.
</P>
<P>
The British troops were reportedly stationed at a base about
40 kilometers east of Freetown, where British instructors are
training Sierra Leonean army recruits. They were accompanied by a
government soldier, who was acting as their guide and was also
believed to have been captured.
</P>
<P>
Since Sierra Leone's civil war began in 1991, the rebels have
killed tens of thousands of people in an attempt to gain control
of the government and the country's diamond-mining regions.
</P>
<P>
Britain sent 1,000 soldiers to Freetown in May when the rebels
re-started the conflict, seizing 500 United Nations peacekeepers
and advancing towards the capital. Their presence was thought to
have done much to stabilize the situation in Sierra Leone, a
former British colony.
</P>
<P>
When the British forces withdrew in mid-June, they left behind
about 400 soldiers to train Sierra Leone army recruits.
</P>
<P>
Britain has also donated arms and equipment and sent military
advisers to Sierra Leone.

ABUJA -- Visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton appealed to his

what he could" to help stabilize the rising prices of oil in the

Addressing a joint news conference at the State House in the
capital, Clinton said although Nigeria did not have the capacity
to effect any changes in the current prices of oil, it could still
work with its colleagues in the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) to adjust their production capacities.
