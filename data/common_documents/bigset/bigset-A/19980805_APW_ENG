Tokyo stocks slightly lower in early trading, dollar slides
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with finance official saying yen still too weak

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices fell early Wednesday
following an overnight plunge on Wall Street, while the U.S. dollar
traded lower against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 180.82 points, or 1.13
percent, to close the morning session at 15,842.76 points. On
Tuesday, the Nikkei closed down 141.50 points, or 0.88 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section slipped 9.03 points, or 0.73 percent, to 1,225.58.
The TOPIX closed down 10.63 points, or 0.85 percent, the day
before.
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average recorded its
biggest point loss of the year and its third worst ever, dropping
299.43 points, or 3.41 percent, to 8,487.31.
	   Traders said, however, that the Tokyo market was relatively firm
despite the overnight drop in New York because of expectations for
further action from Japan's new government to stimulate the
economy.
	   On the Tokyo exchange, modest gains in some financial shares _
which have suffered heavy losses recently amid worries about the
economy _ helped offset losses in technology issues.
	   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and senior policy makers of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party on Tuesday agreed on a plan to cut
personal income taxes by about 4 trillion yen (U.S. dlrs 27.7
billion) and corporate taxes by 2 trillion yen (dlrs 13.8 billion).
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar bought 144.01 yen in
morning trading, down 0.61 yen from late in Tokyo on Tuesday and
lower than its late New York rate of 144.97 yen overnight.
	   The dollar weakened in line with the sharp overnight fall on
Wall Street.
	   The yen also got a boost against the dollar as investors were
encouraged that the government seemed to be moving quickly to
implement its tax-cut plans, dealers said.
	   Also Wednesday, the head of the Japanese Finance Ministry's
International Bureau reiterated that Japan supports a strong yen.
	   Asked by reporters about the dollar's drop below 144 yen in
early trading, Haruhiko Kuroda said, ``I still don't think that
(the excessive yen weakness) has been corrected.''
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.210 percent from Tuesday's finish of
1.220 percent, driving its price up to 111.72 yen from 111.66 yen.

Japan's Cabinet approves key bills for cleaning up bad loans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Cabinet approved two bills on Wednesday
designed to clean up bad loans in the country's debt-ridden banking
system.
	   One bill would allow the government to take over insolvent banks
and keep them running for up to five years while bad loans and
remaining assets are sold.
	   The so-called ``bridge bank'' plan would be funded by up to 11
trillion yen (dlrs 76 billion) in public funds and is designed to
prevent the failure of a bank from hurting its healthy customers.
	   The bill would allow government-appointed managers of failed
banks to continue making loans to sound borrowers while they look
for buyers.
	   Japanese financial institutions are suffocating under problem
loans estimated at over 80 trillion yen (dlrs 556 billion), mostly
left over from the collapse of the real estate market in the early
1990s.
	   The second bill would create a special mediator under the Prime
Minister's Office to resolve conflicting claims on the collateral
backing bad loans. The difficulty of untangling such claims has
been a major obstacle to resolving the bad debt problem.
	   The bills, along with other legislation to clean up the
financial system, will be submitted later Wednesday to a special
session of Parliament that ends in October.

Capriati knocked out of Toshiba Tennis Classic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Graf match, quotes. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CARLSBAD, California (AP) _ The latest comeback attempt of
Jennifer Capriati again ended in the first round.
	   Capriati, a teen-age sensation on the WTA tour in the early
1990s, was beaten 5-7, 6-2, 6-2 by Ai Sugiyama of Japan on Tuesday
in the dlrs 450,000 Toshiba Tennis Classic at the La Costa Resort
and Spa.
	   It was the sixth time in 10 WTA tournaments this season Capriati
has been knocked out in the first round.
	   ``So close, but yet so far,'' said Capriati, 22. ``It's been
real disappointing.''
	   In Tuesday's feature match, Steffi Graf, the No. 6 seed,
dominated Julie Halard-Decugis of France 6-2, 6-2.
	   Graf, playing in just her seventh tournament this year because
of injuries, needed only 56 minutes to advance to the second round.
	   ``I'm getting better and better,'' Graf said. ``I'm getting used
to playing matches.''
	   Graf has won this tournament four times, most recently in 1994,
and she improved her record at the event to 21-0.
	   In other matches Tuesday, Joannette Kruger of South Africa beat
seventh-seeded Irina Spirlea of Romania 3-6, 6-2, 6-4; No. 5
Conchita Martinez of Spain beat American Kimberly Po 6-4, 6-2; and
No. 8 Nathalie Tauziat of France eliminated qualifier Shi-Ting Wang
of Taiwan 7-5, 3-6, 6-1.
	   Tauziat struggled in her first match since July 4 when she lost
to Belgium's Jana Novotna in the finals at Wimbledon.
	   ``It's never easy when you play a qualifier,'' Tauziat said.
``They have played matches already and I haven't played since
July.''
	   Capriati is a two-time winner of the La Costa event, capturing
titles in 1991 and 1992. In the 1991 final, she defeated Monica
Seles, then the top-ranked player in the world. Capriati was ranked
sixth in the world as a 15-year-old in 1991.
	   After leaving the tour in late 1993, Capriati has been beset by
various off-the-court problems. She made an abbreviated
one-tournament comeback in 1994, then stayed away from tennis until
launching another comeback in February 1996. She has played
infrequently since then.
	   Capriati had to win three qualifying matches just to move into
the main draw this year.
	   Capriati cruised in the first set. After falling behind 2-1 in
the second set, Sugiyama won the final five games.
	   ``I've been playing good first sets and letting up in the second
sets,'' Capriati said. ``You can't really do that against these
girls.''
	   Her loss showed she still has a long way to go from her current
ranking of No. 111.
	   Kruger's victory was unexpected because she's been in a slump
beginning with the French Open in June, winning just three matches
in her last five tournaments.
	   ``The only way for me to win the match is to go for it,'' Kruger
said. ``It's been a long time since I've been this aggressive for
the whole match.''

Top Honduran judge accuses U.S. of trying to twist justice
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FREDDY CUEVAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Honduras' top judge has denounced
the suspension of a dlrs 4.1 million U.S. aid program, saying the
United States is trying to blackmail his country into freeing a
murderer.
	   ``I will not traffic in the nation's justice due to pressures
from the United States, which respects its own laws but does not do
the same with the rules of other nations,'' Supreme Court President
Oscar Armando Avila said Tuesday at a news conference.
	   A U.S. congressional committee recently voted to suspend dlrs
4.1 million in aid to support judicial reforms in Honduras in
response to the 10-year sentence imposed on Gustave Valle, a U.S.
citizen convicted of murder in a land dispute.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Marti Estell said the aid ``will be
suspended until the situation of Valle is adequately solved.''
	   Valle was convicted of killing laborer Luis Canales during a
1993 gunfight in Talanga, some 20 miles (30 kilometers) northwest
of the capital. The judge said Canales was shot 10 times.
	   Avila denied claims by some of Valle's relatives that officials
had demanded a dlrs 350,000 bribe to free him.
	   Valle's relatives in the United States crusaded on his behalf,
charging that powerful developers who wanted their brother's land
were behind efforts to kill him.
	   Valle claimed shots had been fired at him one night and while he
was at a police station reporting the incident, two men came to his
farm and threatened to kill him. He said he and an employee were
attacked later that day and Canales died in the resulting gunfight.
	   U.S. officials were also upset that Valle was held in prison for
five years before his case came to trial.

International Monetary Fund agrees to Thai budget deficit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund has
agreed to allow Thailand's government and state enterprises to run
limited budget deficits in the next fiscal year as a means to
stimulate economic recovery, a government spokesman said Wednesday.
	   The Thai government announced this week it intends to run a
budget deficit equal to 3.5 percent of gross domestic product. IMF
targets had called for a 1 percent surplus, but that was before the
depth of the country's economic crisis became apparent.
	   The IMF and Thailand are working on ways to ease an economic
contraction in a quarterly review of the dlrs 17.2 billion economic
rescue program the IMF is supervising for the country, said Akhapol
Sorasuchart, the government spokesman.
	   Various analysts have predicted the economy will shrink by
between 6 and 8 percent this year.
	   Thailand is expected to submit its fifth quarterly letter of
intent to the IMF later this month. Government officials have said
it will focus on plans to ease unemployment which has been forecast
to exceed 2 million this year.
	   A team of IMF officials led by Anoop Singh, deputy director for
the Asia and Pacific Department, paid a courtesy call Wednesday on
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai. The IMF officials are expected to
spend the next two weeks working with the Thai government on the
letter of intent.

Seeing double: Vietnamese restaurant employs 11 sets of twins
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Patrons at a new restaurant can be
forgiven for doing double-takes: 11 sets of twins wait on the
tables.
	   The appropriately named Twin Restaurant, which opened a month
ago in Ho Chi Minh City, is the brainchild of well-known Vietnamese
love-song composer Thanh Tung.
	   He got the idea while being served by a twin at a restaurant in
the resort city of Nha Trang. He then scoured the country,
recruiting 11 sets of twins, and hopes to add another four pairs.
	   All are 19 to 23 years old, with five sets of male twins, five
sets of females and one mixed pair. Each pair wears identical
clothing every day. Tung said some will start performing live
music.
	   The restaurant, which also employs 20 non-twins, serves
Vietnamese, Chinese and seafood dishes.

Announcement of Cambodian election results delayed
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The expected announcement of
complete results from last week's parliamentary election was
delayed Wednesday when Cambodia's official election commission
abruptly canceled its daily briefing to the press.
	   National Election Committee chairman Chheng Phon said in a
written statement that the daily briefings were being terminated
because of impromptu news conferences held by opposition
politicians on Tuesday at the committee's media center.
	   Their actions endangered the committee's spirit of neutrality,
it said.
	   The last of the preliminary results would instead be announced
Wednesday afternoon on state-run television, the statement said.
	   Unofficial complete results indicate that Co-Premier Hun Sen's
Cambodian People's Party will win a slight majority in the 122-seat
National Assembly.
	   The committee's statement announcing the termination of
briefings came after it had come under increasing criticism and
sharp questioning from the press.
	   Late Tuesday it became known that its vice chairman, Kassie
Neou, had resigned as head of its subcommittee handling recounts.
	   Kassie Neou, a respected human rights worker, is considered one
of the few independent voices on the committee.
	   He declined to give a reason for his action to The Associated
Press, but a report Wednesday in the newspaper The Cambodia Daily
said he was frustrated by what appeared to be stalling by his
fellow committee members in investigating election complaints.
	   The committee, widely seen as being stacked in favor of Hun
Sen's ruling party, has been criticized for taking a passive
approach to complaints of irregularities and tardiness in releasing
the results from the July 26 poll.
	   With all but two of 23 electoral districts announced by
Wednesday morning, the ruling Cambodian People's Party was the top
vote-getter in 18 provinces, the opposition party FUNCINPEC in two,
and its ally the Sam Rainsy party in one.
	   Opposition parties, however, have complained of widespread
electoral irregularities and fraud, and threatened to boycott the
National Assembly if their concerns are not met.
	   The National Election Committee on Tuesday began recounting
votes from three communes in the southern province of Takeo, and on
Wednesday began recounts for two communes in Kampong Speu province,
just west of the capital.
	   ``We will continue to look into (the complaints) gradually until
they are done,'' said Samraing Kamsan, a committee spokesman.ddh as
his co-premier in a violent coup d'etat, shattering a tense dual
premiership formed after the U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993. Hun
Sen hoped the polls would win back his legitimacy in the
international arena and aid lost after his power grab.
	   But the opposition has a string of complaints about fraud and
irregularities and has threatened to boycott the National Assembly
when its next session opens on Sept. 24 if their concerns are not
met.
	   Without the opposition's attendance, the assembly is unlikely to
have present the two-thirds of its 122 members needed to conduct
any major business.
	   Hun Sen has warned that if the opposition carries out their
threat, he could lower the constitutional minimum for the assembly
to meet from two-thirds to 50 percent plus one and confirm a
government.
	   He also said his current government could simply remain in
power.

Judge clears Mexican drug cartel suspect; rearrested on U.S.

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A man accused of heading Mexico's largest
methamphetamine smuggling ring was cleared of money-laundering
charges, but federal agents immediately re-arrested him on a U.S.
extradition request.
	   A judge in Guadalajara dropped money-laundering charges against
Jose de Jesus Amezcua, the federal attorney general's office said
Tuesday in a news release. The office said it would appeal.
	   When Amezcua, 32, and his brother Luis, 34, were arrested on
June 1, the agency announced that it had broken up the country's
largest methamphetamine and amphetamine trafficking cartel.
	   Another brother, Adan, was arrested in November.
	   Officials never formally charged the Amezcua brothers with drug
trafficking, however, and defense attorneys claimed that the only
drug evidence prosecutors presented came from newspaper stories.
	   Two earlier counts of money laundering and criminal association
were dismissed soon after the June arrests.
	   The attorney general's office said federal anti-drug police
arrested Jose de Jesus Amezcua on a U.S. extradition request as he
was leaving the Puente Grande prison near Guadalajara.
	   Luis and Adan Amezcua remained in prison on the money-laundering
charge.
	   In June, a federal grand jury in California indicted Jose de
Jesus and Luis on charges of manufacturing and distributing
methamphetamine; conspiracy to possess ephedrine, a component of
``meth'' or ``speed;'' and continuing a criminal enterprise.
	   Authorities contend the brothers contacted suppliers in India,
Germany, China and elsewhere to buy meth ingredients, and set up
labs to make the finished product in the United States and Mexico.
	   Jose de Jesus Amezcua previously was indicted in 1993 on cocaine
charges, and Luis Amezcua was already under a 1994 indictment for
meth making.
	   In December, U.S. drug agents rounded up more than 80 people
linked to the alleged gang, including the purported Los Angeles and
Dallas cell leaders.
	   Mexican prosecutors said the brothers had 125 small businesses,
farms and other properties and had not paid full taxes due on their
income.
	   The brothers, based in the western state of Colima, said they
inherited most of their properties from their father or grandfather
and that their family had sold some of those on the government's
list 15 years ago.

MILWAUKEE: the win.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Mets 7, Giants 6 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   In New York, the Mets broke a streak of seven straight
extra-inning losses when Lenny Harris drew a bases-loaded walk from
Jose Mesa (2-1) with two outs in the 10th.
	   New York, which overcame a 4-0 deficit, then wasted a two-run
lead in the ninth, won for the 11th time in 16 games and snapped
the Giants' four-game winning streak.
	   Mets closer John Franco _ who signed a dlrs 6.15 million,
two-year extension earlier in the day _ failed to lead the lead in
the ninth, allowing a game-tying single to Barry Bonds. Dennis Cook
(7-4) pitched the 10th for the win.
 &UR; Astros 9, Marlins 5
	   In Miami, Moises Alou started the scoring against former
teammate Livan Hernandez (9-8) with a two-run double in the first.
	   Hernandez allowed seven runs and eight hits in 6 1-3 innings,
his worst outing since April 20. Bill Spiers knocked out the
right-hander with a two-run triple in the seventh.
	   The Marlins hit six lineouts, including three that Houston
turned into double plays. Shane Reynolds (13-7), helped by the good
defense and good fortune, pitched six innings and allowed three
runs, all in the first.
	   The start of the game was delayed one hour and 57 minutes by
rain.
 &UR; Padres 3, Phillies 1
	   In San Diego, Greg Vaughn, stuck in a 4-for-42 slump, hit his
39th homer as San Diego handed Philadelphia its sixth straight
loss.
	   Two of Vaughn's previous four hits were homers, and he's just
three shy of breaking his career-best of 41 set in 1996. Vaughn is
third in the NL in homers, six behind Mark McGwire and three behind
Sammy Sosa.
	   He struck out in his first two at-bats before connecting on a
1-1 pitch from Matt Beech (3-8) with one out in the fifth for a 3-0
lead.
	   Left-hander Sterling Hitchcock (5-4) got his first win since
June 27, when he held Anaheim hitless before Phil Nevin homered on
the first pitch of the eighth.
	   Hitchcock pitched effectively in his last two starts, but got a
loss and a no-decision. He held the Phillies to five hits and one
run in six innings and struck out eight, one shy of his
season-high.
	   Trevor Hoffman pitched the ninth for his 37th save.

Asian markets fall after big drop on Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo HK101 &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The Asian economic contagion that contributed
overnight to the year's worst loss on Wall Street returned home
with the opening of trading Wednesday, pulling markets down to
levels they hadn't seen for months, if not years.
	   While analysts renewed their debate over how much damage Asia's
troubles could inflict on the United States, there was renewed
evidence of the tight interconnection of the world's economies.
	   A drop of nearly 300 points overnight in the Dow Jones
industrial average was at least partly attributed to the seemingly
unending string of bad news from Asia. It also added an
international element to the regional worries about Japan's new
government, China's growth rate, poor corporate earnings and
recession.
	   Some analysts said that Asian giants like Hong Kong's HSBC
Holdings, which have buffered their Asian woes with strong returns
in the United States and Britain, now faced the prospect of those
too topping out.
	   Hong Kong's Hang Seng index, which plunged 4.8 percent on
Monday, resumed its slide early Wednesday. It opened at 7,395, down
another 2.4 percent and about 100 points above its low for the
year. It is about 30 percent down on the year.
	   Around the region, Manila's market is already at a five-year
low. Markets in Malaysia, Taiwan, Singapore, and Thailand, as well
as Japan, all were down in early trading.
	   Hong Kong's market was dragged down by HSBC, which owns Hongkong
Bank and Britain's Midland Bank, and has a majority stake in
another major Hong Kong bank, the Hang Seng Bank.
	   HSBC reported a 16-percent fall in profits this week and a
provision of more than dlrs 1 billion for bad debts. Its stock fell
sharply on Monday, and continued its slide during the week as
analysts cut their earnings forecasts.
	   John Aitken at Rabobank in London told the South China Morning
Post that HSBC's profit sources in the United States and Britain
``have topped out.''
	   More weak midyear earnings reports were expected Wednesday from
airline Cathay Pacific, and on Thursday from Swire Pacific, which
owns 44 percent of the air carrier and is heavily invested in the
battered property market.
	   Many people here are heavily invested in the stock market. The
middle class for decades has seen property investment as the best
way to build wealth.
	   The problems in both the stock and property markets have chopped
a staggering 4 trillion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 516 billion) from
Hong Kong's assets, according to some estimates, and helped plunge
the territory into recession.
	   Hong Kong officials announced Monday that the economy shrank 2.8
percent in the first quarter, and attributed it partly to a fall in
domestic spending _ the assets have been swallowed up by the
markets.
	   In Tokyo on Wednesday, the Nikkei average was down about 124
points to just under 16,000 by early afternoon. Markets were
waiting to see whether Wall Street would rebound, and what Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi would say in a speech Friday on economic
policy.
	   The Philippine Stock Exchange Index lost another 2 percent in
early trading Wednesday, following a 2-percent loss on Tuesday that
left it at its lowest level in five years.
	   Despite a slightly stronger yen and encouraging inflation
figures, traders attributed the loss to worries about Wall Street.
	   Malaysia was down about 1.3 percent and Taiwan about 1 percent.
Thailand and Singapore reported smaller losses, and the Seoul
market was mixed.

Vietnam prepares for Tiger Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ With the Tiger Cup starting in three
weeks, officials are working hard to refurbish the two stadiums to
be used in the eight-team regional soccer competition, a Vietnam
Football Federation official said Wednesday.
	   Ngo Tu Ha, VFF vice chairman, said all preparations must be
completed by Aug. 20, six days before the first kickoff.
	   A team from Asian Marketing Ltd., an affiliate of the Southeast
Asian Football Federation, is expected to arrive Monday to inspect
the work done so far, Ha said.
	   The Tiger Cup originally was to be held in Indonesia this year,
but was moved because of the political and economic uncertainty
there. It was offered to Malaysia, which said it was too busy with
the Commonwealth Games next month, then given to Vietnam.
	   Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia and Laos will play in Group B in
Hanoi, while Thailand, Myanmar, Indonesia and the Philippines will
be in Group A in Ho Chi Minh City.
	   Ha said the organizing committee has set tickets prices ranging
from 25,000 to 100,000 dong (dlrs 2 to dlrs 7.7). Each stadium has
a capacity of 20,000 seats.
	   The winning team will get dlrs 80,000 and the runner-up dlrs
40,000.

	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) _ Ricardo Iribarren scored in the fifth minute
Tuesday night, and the Columbus Crew beat the New York-New Jersey
MetroStars 1-0 to advance to the final of the U.S. Open Cup.
	   Columbus, third in Major League Soccer's Eastern Conference,
will play the Chicago Fire in the championship on Aug. 26 at
Virginia Beach, Virginia.
	   Iribarren beat goalkeeper Tony Meola off a cross from Andrew
Williams.
	   The MetroStars are second in the Eastern Conference, trailing
D.C. United.
	   In the closing game of the doubleheader in New Orleans, Roman
Kosecki and Lubos Kubik scored second-half goals as Chicago beat
the Dallas Burn 3-2 to advance to the championship.
	   Dallas defender Jason Kreis was ejected seven minutes into the
second half for fouling a player from behind, and Chicago defender
Diego Gutierrez was second off 10 minutes later after getting his
second yellow card of the game. Kosecki was ejected in the 71st
minute for his second yellow card.
	   There were 45 fouls in all. Some played blamed the sloppy
surface, usually used for minor-league baseball games.
	   ``Ultimately, you're supposed to play the game on a good surface
with 11 players on each side,'' Dallas goalkeeper Mark Dodd said.
``The game was pretty heated and tempers flared. The point is
nobody should have had to play on this field.''
	   Chicago will play against Columbus in the final on Aug. 26 at
Virginia Beach, Va. The Crew beat the New York-New Jersey
MetroStars in the doubleheader opener.
	   Ante Razov, who left the game with a foot injury, put Chicago
ahead in the 11th minute off a pass from Jesse Marsch, but Mickey
Trotman tied the score 12 minutes later with a header off a pass
from Mark Santel.
	   Kosecki got the go-ahead goal in the 56th minute on a 20-yard
bouncer over a rough infield patch, and Kubik scored on a 25-yard
shot in the 74th. Leonel Alvarez got Dallas' last goal on a penalty
kick in the 83rd.
	   Although many fans came to see Chicago goalkeeper Jorge Campos,
a star for Mexico's national team, he was scratched from the lineup
hours before gametime in favor of Zach Thornton. Fans chanted
Campos' name throughout.

Court orders state, road authorities to pay pollution damages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos staffing

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Ending a 15-year dispute, a court ordered the
Japanese government and road authorities Wednesday to pay a total
of 149 million yen (dlrs 1.03 million) to 48 people who suffered
asthma and other illnesses caused by air pollution.
	   The Yokohama District Court ordered the state and the
Metropolitan Express Public Corp. to make the payment, a court
official said, on condition of anonymity. The state was held
responsible as the caretaker of major roads in the affected areas.
	   Katsusuke Ogawa, presiding judge at the court's Kawasaki branch,
said that the plaintiffs, who have lived within 50 meters (164
feet) from major arteries in Kawasaki, suffered asthma and other
ailments caused by exhaust emitted from automobiles.
	   But Ogawa rejected an injunction appeal by the plaintiffs for a
halt to the discharge of air-polluting substances, saying that the
danger from their suffering was not imminent.
	   Wednesday's ruling came two years after a group of 14 Japanese
companies in Kawasaki, a major industrial city adjoining Tokyo,
reached an out-of-court settlement. The companies agreed to pay 3.1
billion yen (dlrs 21.5 million) to 438 people who complained of
illness from air pollution.
	   In 1994, the Yokohama District Court ruled that the 14 companies
were responsible for the pollution and they should pay 460 million
yen (dlrs 3.2 million) in compensation to the plaintiffs, but both
sides appealed to a higher court.
	   The suit was originally filed against the state and the road
authorities and a group of companies in March 1982. Other people,
who have been designated as patients of the so-called Kawasaki
disease, and family members of victims, later joined the suit. The
plaintiffs demanded a total of 6.38 billion yen (dlrs 44.3 million)
in compensation.
	   Of about 6,000 patients suffering from asthma or other related
Kawasaki disease ailments, some 1,800 have died, with many of the
deaths asthma-related, Kyodo News reported.
	   Officials from the Construction Ministry, the Environment Agency
and the Metropolitan Expressway Public Corp. said that they would
study the contents of Wednesday's ruling and consult with related
organizations before deciding whether to appeal.
	   Last month, some 100 residents in Osaka reached an out-of-court
settlement with the state and a local public corporation in a
similar air pollution case, ending a 20-year dispute.

Japan's Cabinet approves key bills for cleaning up bad loans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with opposition criticism of the bill in last 2 grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Cabinet approved two bills on Wednesday
designed to clean up bad loans in the country's debt-ridden banking
system.
	   One bill would allow the government to take over insolvent banks
and keep them running for up to five years while bad loans and
remaining assets are sold.
	   The so-called ``bridge bank'' plan would be funded by up to 11
trillion yen (dlrs 76 billion) in public funds.
	   The bill is designed to prevent the failure of a bank from
hurting its healthy customers by allowing its government-appointed
managers to continue making loans to sound borrowers.
	   Japanese financial institutions are suffocating under problem
loans estimated at over 80 trillion yen (dlrs 556 billion), mostly
left over from the collapse of the real estate market in the early
1990s.
	   The second bill would create a special mediator under the Prime
Minister's Office to resolve conflicting claims on properties used
as collateral on bad loans. The difficulty of untangling such
claims has been a major obstacle to resolving the bad debt problem.
	   The bills, along with other legislation to clean up the
financial system, will be submitted to parliament later Wednesday.
	   Although the government aims to pass the bills in the current
session of Parliament that ends in October, the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party's defeat in last month's upper house elections
means it may struggle to obtain the necessary legislative support.
	   The opposition Democratic Party has already criticized the bill
for not clearly defining when a bank should be considered insolvent
and for not including punitive measures for negligent managers.

Indonesia to withdraw 600 soldiers from East Timor this weekend
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - About 600 soldiers will leave
Indonesian-controlled East Timor on Saturday, completing a
withdrawal of 1,000 troops, the military said Wednesday.
	   The announcement, part of efforts to end the conflict in the
former Portuguese colony, came after U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan launched talks on East Timor in New York.
	   The foreign ministers of Portugal and Indonesia are taking part
in the two-day talks, scheduled to end Wednesday.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it a year
later. The United Nations, however, does not recognize Indonesian
authority in the troubled territory. A small band of separatist
rebels continues to operate in the hills.
	   On July 28, 400 combat troops left East Timor on a ship after
President B.J. Habibie pledged to reduce the presence of the
military, which has been accused of widespread human rights abuses.
	   The withdrawal of a total of 1,000 combat troops will be
completed on Saturday, leaving 11,000 soldiers in place, said Lt.
Col. Supadi, military chief of staff in East Timor.
	   Dozens of military doctors and teachers will be sent to the
territory of 800,000 people, he said.
	   Habibie, who is promoting nationwide democratic reform, has
offered East Timor a measure of autonomy from Indonesian control.
But activists say they want a vote on independence for the
territory about 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) east of Jakarta.

U.S., Philippines conduct live-fire military exercise near disputed
</HEADLINE>
area

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ U.S. and Philippine warships and
aircraft staged live-fire military exercises Wednesday near a
disputed South China Sea shoal, an act that could trigger protests
from China.
	   The 18-hour exercise was held outside the country's territorial
waters because of the absence of a bilateral agreement governing
exercises in Philippine territory, a Philippine navy spokesman
said.
	   At least five ships and four aircraft joined the exercise, which
involved simulated air and naval attacks using cannon fire to hit
floating targets, Philippine navy spokesman commander Salvador Cuba
said.
	   China was not notified of the military exercise because it was
held in international waters, said Cuba, adding it was not meant to
intimidate any country.
	   A Filipino navy official, however, said on condition of
anonymity that the exercise was held at one point very near
Scarborough Shoal, which is claimed by both the Philippines and
China.
	   There was no immediate reaction from the Chinese Embassy in
Manila.
	   Philippine officials say Scarborough, which lies 213 kilometers
(132 miles) off Zambales, is within the country's 200-mile
exclusive economic zone. Chinese officials say the shoal has
belonged to China since ancient times.
	   Cuba said the exercise was held outside the Philippines due to a
delay in the Philippine Senate's approval of a Visiting Forces
Agreement which would provide American troops with legal
protections while on duty in the Philippines.
	   The United States halted all joint exercises in the Philippines
and visits by U.S. military ships in December 1996, when the Manila
government ended a legal loophole that had shielded U.S. military
personnel from prosecution by the Philippines for crimes committed
here.
	   The Philippine Senate has not yet begun deliberations on the
accord, which was signed early this year by U.S. and Philippine
officials.
	   Critics say the accord limits the Philippine government's right
to prosecute American soldiers who commit crimes.
	   Despite the absence of the accord, Cuba said the countries
carried out a small-scale naval surveillance exercise in the
central Philippines Tuesday that involved 16 U.S. Navy men.
	   Military ties with the United States have remained a sensitive
issue since a nationalist Philippine Senate forced the closure of
the last U.S. base in the country in 1992, ending close to a
century of American military presence in its former colony.

Tropical storm Otto roaring toward southern China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Tropical storm Otto roared towards
southern China on Wednesday after killing at least one person in
Taiwan, dumping heavy rains, destroying crops and leaving thousands
of households without power.
	   As of 8 a.m. (0000 GMT), Otto was heading toward China's
southern Fujian province, packing sustained winds of 66 kilometers
per hour (40 mph), the Central Weather Bureau said.
	   Police said a man was killed and two people were hurt in Chiayi,
southern Taiwan, Tuesday when their car was hit by a falling rock.
Another person was swept away by waves as he was fishing on the
eastern Hualien coast, and was classified as missing.
	   Heavy rains contributed to a car crash that killed another three
people, but police were not classifying those as storm deaths.
	   The storm dumped 400 millimeters (16 inches) of rain in Chiayi
in a 24-hour period, causing further landslides and cave-ins in an
area that was struck by a 6.2 magnitude earthquake last week.
	   In nearby Nantou, the storm flooded rivers and landslides
blocked traffic. About 5,000 tourists and villagers were stranded
in the mountainous area, police said.
	   The storm uprooted trees and destroyed fruit and other crops
island-wide, causing damage estimated at 13 million Taiwan dollars
(U.S. dlrs 370,000), the Agriculture Council said.
	   More than 80,000 households lost electrical power island-wide,
officials said.

Singapore to review taxes as economy slumps towards recession
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore will review its current tax
incentives for various key industries as the vulnerable
city-state's economy continues to slump towards recession, a
newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The government-run Economic Development Board will study
existing tax arrangements within the next six weeks _ especially
for the important chemical, electronics, engineering and services
sector _ according to The Straits Times.
	   The board's chairman Philip Yeo warned that Singapore was
becoming less competitive than its rivals, and the island republic
must explore policies to catch up with its competitors.
	   The cost of labor and other operating expenses in the prosperous
city-state are now much higher than neighboring countries such as
Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia.
	   Despite this, the country has been able to attract a large
number of foreign businesses in high-tech industries like computer
parts and chemical manufacturing, though there are growing concerns
over its ability to continue attracting such enterprises.
	   Singapore unveiled a series of special economic measures in late
June to help businesses cope with the slowdown in demand associated
with the ongoing Asian crisis.
	   Some mild tax rebates were introduced, but a number of
businesses and economists in Singapore have been clamoring for more
substantial tax cuts and other help from the authorities.
	   The government currently offers a number of tax incentives for
foreign companies setting up here, including a corporate tax
exemption of five to 10 years for pioneering businesses, deductions
for research and development, along with grants for training
employees.
	   The Economic Development Board will present its findings to a
committee comprised of 17 corporate chiefs that monitors
Singapore's competitiveness and recommends strategies to boost it.

Nearly 7,000 business fail in Thailand during past seven months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Nearly 7,000 businesses have failed in
Thailand during the first seven months of 1998 as the country's
economic crisis intensified, the Commerce Ministry said Wednesday.
	   Worst hit were retail outlets, hotels and restaurants.
	   The Ministry's Department of Commercial Registration said 6,377
business failed from January to the end of July. The total capital
of the companies closed down equaled 16.34 billion baht (dlrs 398
million).
	   The department said 477 retail stores, hotels and restaurants
went bust, while 193 insurance, financial and other service sector
companies failed and 175 construction companies collapsed.
	   Thailand is in the midst of its worst economic morass in modern
times. Unemployment is expected to reach 2.2 million this year,
despite a dlrs 17.2 billion rescue package from the International
Monetary Fund.

Mobil cancels plans to build service stations in Thailand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ With Thai demand for fuel shrinking
because of the country's economic crisis, U.S.-based Mobil Oil said
Wednesday it will not build any more service stations in Thailand
and predicted many would close.
	   Mobil Oil Thailand President Duke Keiser forecast that between
2,000 and 2,500 of Thailand's 13,000 service stations will be
forced out of business this year.
	   ``That might not be enough,'' he said. ``The market is not going
to support that number of service stations.''
	   He said the 200 or so stations slated to open this year were the
result of plans made by several oil companies before Thailand's
economic crisis hit in July 1997.
	   Thailand is receiving a dlrs 17.2 billion IMF bailout, but many
in the country are still suffering. Nearly 7,000 businesses have
failed this year and unemployment is expected to reach 2.2 million.
	   Thousands of cars have been repossessed, providing slight relief
from Bangkok's notorious traffic jams.

Philippine stocks end mixed; blue chips stage recovery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks ended mixed
Wednesday, with most blue chips advancing after being oversold in
recent sessions but most other stocks weakened after Wall Street's
overnight plunge, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 13.31 points
to 1,524.75, following its 31.63-point, or 2 percent, decline
Tuesday to 1,511.44, its lowest level in five years.
	   Decliners, however, trounced gainers 46 to 29, while 44 issues
were unchanged.
	   Wednesday's advance ended a three-day losing streak in the index
totaling 102.06 points, or 6.3 percent.
	   Edwin Siao, trader for institutional sales of Abacus Securities
Corp., said the blue chips' advance caught the market by surprise
after the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.4 percent overnight,
its biggest loss this year.
	   Siao said better-than-expected July inflation data released
before the market opened Wednesday helped minimize the ill effects
of Wall Street's fall.
	   The market was bracing for an inflation rate ranging between 11
percent and 11.5 percent. Instead, the government reported a 10.6
percent rise, largely on a slowdown in food expenditures.
	   Siao said the improved performance of the yen also reduced the
adverse impact of Wall Street's decline.
	   Traders who needed to cover short positions also fueled demand
for oversold stocks Wednesday, dealers said.
	   However, they said the overall mood in regional stock markets
remained bearish with Asian economies seen recovering only after
two to three years.
	   ``The question is the sustainability of the rally. The only way
to drive the market at this point would be fund flow,'' said Siao.
However, this may not be forthcoming owing to the poor economic
environment in Asia, he said.
	   Traders expect the market to remain weak in the following
trading days, with the main index set to test the 1,450-point
support level soon.
	   In currency trading, the peso was up slightly against the dollar
in early trading, mirroring the Japanese yen's gradual
appreciation.
	   The Japanese currency was advancing against the dollar on
reports that tax cuts next year could be higher than initially
estimated.
	   At late morning the dollar averaged 42.083 pesos, down from
Tuesday's average of 42.128 pesos.
	   Dealers said the inflation figures had little impact on
peso-dollar trading.

China struggles to cope with deadly flooding
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JIAYU, China (AP) _ First came a rushing sound and warning
cries. The local TV station interrupted its broadcasts to warn
people to flee.
	   Then came the wall of water that drowned homes and fields in one
of China's worst floods so far in an unusually destructive season
of summer flooding that has already killed at least 1,288 people.
	   Four days after a dike protecting it collapsed, Jiayu county in
central China's Hubei province was struggling Wednesday to cope
with the flooding's aftermath.
	   The death toll from Saturday's floods caused by the sudden levee
collapse remained unclear Wednesday. County officials said they
were concentrating on rescuing and resettling the living, not
counting the dead or injured.
	   A Hong Kong-based human rights group claimed Tuesday that more
than 1,000 people were believed to be missing, and that 150
soldiers and hundreds of villagers were swept away when the levee
burst.
	   Officials denied Wednesday that so many people were missing, but
said casualty figures were still being compiled. One official said
people were killed, another said there were no fatalities. Many
indicated it was too early to tell.
	   An official newspaper, the Hubei Daily, said Wednesday that 19
soldiers were missing. One of the paper's affiliates, Chutiandusi,
said Tuesday that 148 people had been killed in flooding in all of
Hubei province.
	   In Jiayu, people whose homes were flooded said the water came
suddenly. Some said they heard a rushing sound, others heard
warning shouts. On Wednesday, just a few roofs from poked through
the waters. Most houses were completely submerged.
	   Some people were living in plastic lean-tos. Other survivors
were moved into farmers' houses or school buildings vacated for the
summer holidays, said a Jiayu government official. Like most
officials, he refused to give his name.
	   He said the majority of the 57,000 people who were flooded out
had been resettled, and the government was providing food and
water.
	   Paizhou and Hezhen, the two towns in Jiayu that were flooded,
lie along the Yangtze, the world's third-largest river. This year,
the river has risen to levels unseen since flooding in 1954 killed
more than 30,000 people.
	   Yangtze floodwaters, caused by summer rains that fell heavier
and earlier than usual, have displaced millions of people and
inundated vast stretches of rich farmland. Millions of soldiers and
civilians are toiling on the Yangtze's dikes, watching for signs of
collapse and plugging leaks.
	   So far, the main Yangtze levees have reportedly remained intact,
but secondary levees like that in Jiayu have been breached. In at
least one instance, small dikes have been deliberately abandoned to
divert floodwaters away from the Yangtze, in a bid to lower the
river level and protect cities downstream.

Singapore Airlines execs give up pay raise to cope with crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Top executives at Singapore's profitable
national airline have given up their pay raises to help the company
weather the economic crisis, according to The Straits Times
newspaper.
	   More than 20 members of Singapore Airlines' management,
including chairman Michael Fam and deputy chairman Cheong Choong
Kong, have forfeited their 3.5 percent service increments.
	   The voluntary cuts could save the company more than 200,000
Singapore dollars (dlrs 116,000) per month, according to the
newspaper.
	   The airline, normally one of the most profitable carriers in the
region, is nevertheless feeling the pinch from the Asian crisis.
	   Passenger numbers have been down for months, and the airline has
warned that earnings and profits for 1998 are likely to fall below
last year's healthy 1.04 billion Singapore dollar (dlrs 605
million) net earnings.
	   Since the start of the economic downturn, Singapore Airlines has
reduced its services within Asia in favor of increased flights to
destinations outside the region, where passenger demand remains
more robust.

Hanhwa sells ball bearing division to Germany's FAG
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Germany's FAG Kugelfischer Georg
Schaefer AG agreed Wednesday to set up a joint venture with Hanhwa
Group of South Korea to take over its ball bearing division for
dlrs 214 million.
	   FAG will hold 70 percent of the joint venture company, which
will start operations in October, with the remaining 30 percent to
be held by Hanhwa, the South Korean company said.
	   The new FAG-Hanhwa Bearing Co. will be set up with dlrs 180
million in capital and dlrs 34 million in bank loans to take over

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The expected announcement of
Cambodian leader Hun Sen's victory in last week's parliamentary
election was delayed Wednesday when election officials abruptly
canceled their daily briefing to the press.
	   National Election Committee chairman Chheng Phon said in a
written statement that twice-daily briefings were being terminated
because of an impromptu news conference held by opposition
politicians on Tuesday at the committee's media center.
	   Their actions endangered the committee's spirit of neutrality,
the statement said, and the announcement of official preliminary
results of the July 26 elections would be announced instead on
state-run television Wednesday afternoon.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party is slated to win a slight
majority in the 122-National Assembly, according to partial results
which have already been released by the NEC.
	   The election committee's termination of briefings came after it
had come under increasing criticism and sharp questioning from the
press.
	   Late Tuesday it became known that its vice chairman, Kassie
Neou, had asked to resign as head of its subcommittee handling
recounts.
	   Kassie Neou, a respected human rights worker considered one of
the few independent voices on the committee, said he was frustrated
by administrative and management problems, according to spokesman
Samraing Kamsan, who said that the resignation had not yet been
approved.
	   ``Chheng Phon asked him to slow down his anger and told him
there was no need to resign,'' said Samraing Kamsan, acknowledging
that organizational problems in the NEC have left many frustrated
and over-tired.
	   The committee, widely seen as being stacked in favor of Hun
Sen's ruling party, has been criticized for taking a passive
approach to complaints of irregularities.
	   It has also been at the center of a controversy over a changed
formula for allocating parliamentary seats to the election winners.
	   Last week it became generally known that a draft formula for the
calculations had been slightly amended sometime before the
election.
	   The newer method favors the party winning the most seats in any
given district. In practice this favors the ruling CPP, providing
them with an extra five seats, enough to attain a parliamentary
majority.
	   The committee says the change was legal and approved by the
political parties before the election, but has been unable to
provide the reasoning behind the change.
	   The main opposition parties have called on the NEC to recount
ballots in areas where they suspect irregularities, threatening to
boycott the National Assembly if their concerns are not met. On
Wednesday a handful of politicians launched a call for a total
recount.
	   Without the opposition's attendance, the assembly is unlikely to
have present the two-thirds of its 122 members needed to conduct
any major business.
	   ``They have the right to request the recount of all ballots, but
for this we need a lot of time, money, and people,'' said spokesman
Samraing Kamsan, adding that he doubted the request would get very
far.
	   The recounting of votes from three communes in the southern
province of Takeo began on Tuesday following several delays, and on
Wednesday officials were starting on recounts for two communes in
Kampong Speu province, just west of the capital.
	   The election was held one year after Hun Sen ousted Prince
Norodom Ranariddh as his co-premier in a violent coup d'etat,
shattering a tense dual premiership formed after the U.N.-sponsored
elections in 1993. Ranariddh heads the FUNCINPEC party, the main
challenger in the election.
	   Hun Sen hoped the polls would win back his legitimacy in the
international arena and aid lost after his power grab.

Two Jewish settlers killed, right-wing calls for halt in talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with right-wing calls to end talks, quotes, new
details on the attack. Changes byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC;

<TEXT>
	   ITZHAR, West Bank (AP) _ Two Israeli settlers were ambushed and
killed Wednesday as they patrolled a Jewish settlement, prompting
right-wing calls for a suspension of talks with Palestinians.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu planned to discuss the
shooting with his 12-member security Cabinet Wednesday amid calls
that he freeze negotiations until Palestinians hand over the
attackers.
	   Aviv Bushinsky, spokesman for Netanyahu, said the prime minsiter
takes a ``very grave view'' of the attack that killed two Jewish
seminary students.
	   ``He said that this proves the necessity of protecting the
security interests of the settlers in the negotiations with the
Palestinians,'' said Bushinsky.
	   Nabil Amr, an adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
member of the elected legislative council, said the attack
underlined the need for ``serious ideas'' from Israel to move the
peace process forward.
	   ``If Israel continues to waste time then that means we are
leaving the field open for others to do everything they want to end
the whole process, just like what happened last night,'' he said on
Israel Radio's Arabic service.
	   Negotiations have been stalled for months over a U.S. proposal
for Israel to withdraw from an additional 13 percent of the West
Bank, a move that would leave many settlements as islands inside
Palestinian-controlled zones.
	   Netanyahu, under pressure from the strong Jewish settler lobby
and right-wing members of his Cabinet, has insisted on changes in
the American plan, including more stringent counter-terrorism
measures by Palestinians.
	   In his latest offer, Netanyahu proposed withdrawing from 10
percent of the territory and turning an additional 3 percent into a
nature reserve where Israel's army would retain overall security.
But Arafat rejected the Israeli proposal on Tuesday.
	   Jewish settler leaders said even a 10 percent withdrawal would
have left Itzhar cut off and surrounded by Palestinian-controlled
territory. They said Wednesday's killings were a harbinger of
things to come if the pullback goes through.
	   ``This is a tragic example of what is likely to occur ten-fold
when troop redeployments are carried out. Itzhar and 18 other
settlements will be turned into isolated islands,'' said settler
council leader Ahron Dombe. He called on Netanyahu to cancel talks
until the assailants were found.
	   Michael Kleiner, a supporter of the settlers in the Israeli
Knesset, called for convening the 120-member parliament which is
now in summer recess and debating a proposal to stop talks with the
Palestinians until Arafat's government hands over the attackers to
Israel. He also demanded Israel not go through with a reported plan
to free 100 Palestinian prisoners.
	   Killed in the attack were Harel Binoun, 18, and Shlomo Livman,
24, both sons of prominent rabbis and students at the Joseph's tomb
seminary in the heart of Nablus - a focal point of past
confrontations between Palestinians and Jewish settlers.
	   Following the shootings, Israel placed a curfew on five
surrounding Palestinian villages and closed roads leading to Nablus
as troops searched the area for the shooters.
	   Moshe Yaalon, the army's West Bank commander, said the two
Israelis were patrolling outside the settlement about midnight when
they were shot by two attackers laying in ambush. One of the
Israelis was carrying a weapon, reportedly an M-16 assault rifle,
which was taken by the ambushers.
	   ``The terrorists apparently had planned this attack and knew
when the pickup truck would be coming by. They firing was carried
out from very close range,'' he said.
	   The four-wheel drive vehicle was riddled with bullets, and
Israel army radio said the attackers repeatedly fired into the
bodies of the Israelis to make sure they were dead.
	   An Israeli officer in the the West Bank told reporters that the
attackers repeatedly struck one of the settlers on the head with an
ax, as well.

Stable food prices check Philippine inflation in July
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Stable food prices lowered inflation
pressures in the Philippines in July, with inflation softening to
10.6 percent on the year from 10.7 percent in June, the government
said Wednesday.
	   The significantly better-than-expected figures buoyed the stock
market, with the main index snapping a three-day losing streak in
which it fell 6.3 percent to its lowest level in five years.
	   In the seven months to July, inflation averaged 9.2 percent,
well within the government's target of single-digit average
inflation for the year.
	   The government said food prices, which have a hefty weighting on
the consumer price index, stabilized in July after several months
of increases.
	   Economists had predicted inflation rising by as much as 11.5
percent in July largely on expectations that a drought caused by
the El Nino weather condition would continue to force food prices
higher.
	   ``Based on recent indicators the economy could be veering toward
a lower inflation path,'' Socio-Economic Planning Secretary Felipe
Medalla said.
	   Medalla said he remains optimistic that the easing of El Nino
and importation of rice, a basic foodstuff in the Philippines,
means that the prices of agricultural-based products will continue
to fall as rains normalize.
	   But this is likely to remain a contentious issue with some
economists, who believe that the effects of El Nino on agricultural
production haven't abated yet.
	   The country's inventory of rice totaled 1.446 million tons at
the end of last month, which is sufficient for 66 days' supply.
This is 24 days short of the ideal 90-day inventory for the third
quarter.
	   Meanwhile, the government expects the sugar inventory to reach
113,000 tons by end-August, still short of the monthly requirement
of 150,000.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with late Yankees-Athletics game; ADDS
other games, should stand. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ Mike Mussina lost his perfect game with two
outs in the eighth inning Tuesday night and settled for a
two-hitter, leading the Baltimore Orioles past the Detroit Tigers
4-0.
	   Mussina (10-5), who has flirted with a no-hitter twice before in
his seven-year career, retired the first 23 batters before Frank
Catalanotto lined a double into the right-field corner.
	   Mussina, who struck out eight, retired the first 25 Cleveland
Indians on May 30, 1997, before Sandy Alomar singled with one out
in the ninth.
	   Eric Davis homered to extend his hitting streak to a career-high
21 games as Baltimore improved to 19-5 since the All-Star break.
	   Bryce Florie (5-6) took the loss.
 &UR; Yankees 10, Athletics 4
 &UR; Yankees 10, Athletics 5
	   In Oakland, California, Darryl Strawberry hit a tying pinch
grand slam as New York scored nine runs in the ninth inning to
complete a doubleheader sweep.
	   Strawberry, who tied a major league record with two pinch slams
in a season, also homered in the opener. He reached 20 homers for
the first time since 1991, the last of his nine straight 20-homer
seasons.
	   New York improved to 80-28 as its season reached the two-thirds
mark, leaving the Yankees on pace to finish 120-42.
	   Kenny Rogers, pitching against his former team for the first
time, took a 5-1 lead into the ninth but was knocked out by
consecutive singles.
	   After the slam off Billy Taylor (3-9), the go-ahead run scored
when Chuck Knoblauch came home from second on a groundout as first
baseman Jason Giambi, accidentally kicked in the head by Derek
Jeter, lay motionless on the ground with the ball in his mitt.
Giambi was diagnosed with a mild concussion and taken to a hospital
for tests.
	   Paul O'Neill and Tino Martinez homered, and Graeme Lloyd (2-0)
pitched two perfect innings.
	   Strawberry and Chuck Knoblauch homered in the opener. Ramiro
Mendoza (7-2) allowed four runs and seven hits in 6 1-3 innings and
Mike Stanton retired eight straight for his sixth save.
	   Jay Witasick (0-1) allowed seven runs _ three earned _ five hits
and seven walks in 4 2-3 innings in his first major league start.
 &UR; White Sox 8, Devil Rays 6 &QC; 
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, Albert Belle and Robert Machado
homered and Chicago's bullpen limited Tampa Bay to three hits in
the last six innings.
	   Belle's homer, a solo shot in the sixth inning off Esteban Yan,
was his 34th this season and 16th in 25 games since the All-Star
break.
	   Mike Kelly hit two home runs for Tampa Bay.
	   Carlos Castillo (5-4) pitched three innings in relief of White
Sox starter Jim Parque for the victory. Bill Simas got four outs
for his 11th save. Tony Saunders (3-10) was the loser.
 &UR; Royals 12, Twins 4
	   In Minneapolis, Hipolito Pichardo (6-8) allowed three earned
runs and eight hits in 7 1-3 innings, and Kansas City set season
highs for hits (16) and runs.
	   Jeff King drove in three runs and Jermaine Allensworth scored
three times.
	   Eric Milton (6-8) was tagged for eight runs and eight hits in 2
2-3 innings on his 23rd birthday, the shortest outing of the
rookie's career.
 &UR; Rangers 11, Blue Jays 9
	   In Arlington, Texas, Carlos Delgado hit three home runs for
Toronto, but they were not enough to overcome Todd Stottlemyre's
solid debut for Texas.
	   Stottlemyre (1-0), traded from St. Louis to Texas on Friday in a
four-player deal, struck out eight in 5 2-3 innings, allowing two
earned runs and six hits. He left with Texas leading 10-3.
	   Texas scored seven unearned runs in the fifth against Chris
Carpenter (6-6).
 &UR; Red Sox 2, Mariners 1
	   In Seattle, Steve Avery (8-4) and two relievers combined on a
two-hitter, and John Valentin snapped a seventh-inning tie with an
RBI groundout.
	   Derek Lowe and Tom Gordon finished with hitless relief. Gordon
gave up a one-out walk in the ninth before getting Ken Griffey Jr.
on a groundout and Edgar Martinez to pop out with the tying run at
third for his his 32nd save.
	   Greg McCarthy (0-2) was the loser.
 &UR; Angels 5, Indians 4
	   In Anaheim, California, Gary DiSarcina singled home the
tiebreaking run off Doug Jones (0-1) in the eighth, and Cleveland
lost its fifth straight.
	   Manny Ramirez homered twice, singled and drove in four runs for
the Indians, giving them a 4-1 lead in the sixth.
	   Shigetoshi Hasegawa (6-1) pitched a scoreless inning in relief
of starter Chuck Finley. Troy Percival got three outs for his 30th
save.

Businesses launch class action suit against Sydney Water
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A group of hotels, convenience stores
and dentists launched a class action lawsuit Wednesday against
Sydney Water over the city's recent water contamination scare.
	   Law firm Slater and Gordon said the action had been filed at the
Federal Court and a preliminary hearing was scheduled for Aug. 31
in Sydney.
	   ``The lead applicant is dentist Michael Schokman, whose
practice, which employs several dentists and staff, was closed for
four days,'' Slater and Gordon said in a statement.
	   ``Like many other small businesses, the practice has lost
thousands of dollars.''
	   The Australian Hotels Association and 7-Eleven convenience
stores were also part of the action.
	   Slater and Gordon has previously estimated that Sydney Water
could lose millions of dollars in compensation payments and
lawsuits to individuals and businesses harmed by the nearly
weeklong water contamination scare.
	   On Thursday, Sydney's water was declared free of the parasites
giardia and cryptosporidium that last week forced officials to warn
3.7 million Sydney residents to boil their drinking water.

Tokyo stocks slightly lower, dollar slides

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stock prices, afternoon bond and currency
rates &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo's key stock index fell Wednesday following an
overnight plunge on Wall Street but the decline was limited amid
hopes Japan's new government will move quickly to boost the
economy.
	   The U.S. dollar declined against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 31.42 points, or 0.20
percent, closing at 15,992.16. On Tuesday, the Nikkei had fallen
141.50 points, or 0.88 percent.
	   Shares prices sank from the opening bell after the Dow Jones
industrial average recorded its biggest point loss of the year
overnight in New York.
	   Electronics companies and international exporters were mostly
weaker following the plunge by their U.S. counterparts. But a rise
in some bank stocks helped offset the declines as bargain hunters
moved in following recent heavy losses in financial shares.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section gained 1.17 points, or 0.09 percent, to 1,235.78. It
had declined 10.63 points, or 0.85 percent, the previous day.
	   Trading on the exchange's main section was estimated at 363
million shares, up from 356.35 million Tuesday. Declines
outnumbered advances 623 to 476, while 180 issues were unchanged.
	   Many market players were waiting to see what New York stocks
would do after the Dow dropped 299.43 points, or 3.41 percent, to
8,487.31 Tuesday, traders said. Investors also hesitated to place
bets on the market's movement before a key policy speech Friday by
Japan's new prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, traders said.
	   In Obuchi's speech to Parliament, traders and investors are
looking for indications the government will be able to promptly
implement promised tax cuts and pass bills to revitalize the ailing
financial industry.
	   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and senior policy makers of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party agreed Tuesday on a plan to cut
personal income taxes by about 4 trillion yen (U.S. dlrs 27.7
billion) and corporate taxes by 2 trillion yen (dlrs 13.8 billion).
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar sank to its lowest
level in about a week as worries about Wall Street declines weighed
on the U.S. currency. Optimism that tax cuts could help Japan's
sagging economy boosted the yen.
	   The dollar sank to an intraday low of 143.47, its weakest level
since 141.75 last Thursday.
	   The U.S. currency was quoted at 143.86 yen in midafternoon, down
0.76 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and lower than its late New
York rate of 144.97 yen overnight.
	   Also helping the yen were comments Wednesday by the head of the
Finance Ministry's International Bureau, reiterating that Japan
supports a strong domestic currency.
	   Asked by reporters about the dollar's drop below 144 yen in
early trading, Haruhiko Kuroda said, ``I still don't think that
(the excessive yen weakness) has been corrected.''
	   Meanwhile, the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond was unchanged from Tuesday's close at a yield of 1.210 percent
and a price of 111.64 yen.

Asian markets fall after big drop on Wall Street

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The Asian economic contagion that contributed
overnight to the year's worst loss on Wall Street returned home
with the opening of trading Wednesday, helping to drag some markets
to levels they hadn't seen for months, if not years.
	   While analysts renewed their debate over how much damage Asia's
troubles could inflict on the United States, there was renewed
evidence of the tight interconnection of the world's economies.
	   A drop of nearly 300 points overnight in the Dow Jones
industrial average was at least partly attributed to the seemingly
unending string of bad news from Asia. Back in Asia, it added an
international element to the regional worries about Japan's new
government, China's growth rate, poor corporate earnings and
recession.
	   Some analysts said Asian giants like Hong Kong's HSBC Holdings,
which have buffered their Asian woes with strong returns in the
United States and Britain, now faced the prospect of those topping
out, too.
	   Hong Kong's Hang Seng index, which plunged 4.8 percent Monday,
resumed its slide early Wednesday. It closed the morning session
down 2 percent at 7,430, after rebounding slightly from its opening
level. The Hang Seng is around 100 points above its low for the
year and 30 percent down since the start of 1998.
	   Manila's market staged a technical rebound after hitting a
five-year low Tuesday and then dropping further early Wednesday.
Tokyo's Nikkei index ended down 31.42 points, or 0.20 percent, at
15,992.16 as traders waited to see whether Wall Street would
rebound, and what Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi would say in a speech
Friday on economic policy.
	   Shares were down more than 3 percent at the end of trading in
Seoul, fell to their lowest level in almost two months in Taiwan,
and dropped more moderately in Australia and New Zealand.
	   Hong Kong's market was dragged down by HSBC, which owns Hongkong
Bank and Britain's Midland Bank, and has a majority stake in
another major Hong Kong bank, the Hang Seng Bank.
	   HSBC reported a 16 percent fall in profits this week and a
provision of more than dlrs 1 billion for bad debts. Its stock fell
sharply Monday, and continued its slide during the week as analysts
cut their earnings forecasts.
	   John Aitken at Rabobank in London told the South China Morning
Post that HSBC's profit sources in the United States and Britain
``have topped out.''
	   More weak midyear earnings reports were expected Wednesday from
Cathay Pacific airline, and on Thursday from Swire Pacific, which
owns 44 percent of the airline and is heavily invested in the
battered property market.
	   The markets are vitally important in Hong Kong because many
people are heavily invested, and the middle class for decades has
seen buying property as the best way to build wealth.
	   The problems of both the stock and property markets have chopped
a staggering 4 trillion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 516 billion) from
Hong Kong's assets, according to some estimates, andCo a fall
in domestic spending _ the assets have been swallowed up by the
markets.

Painted signs add to fears of ethnic Chinese in Indonesian city
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Amid fears of ethnic violence,
graffiti have appeared on Chinese-owned homes and shops in an
Indonesian city, allegedly marking the buildings for attack.
	   The military has urged ethnic Chinese residents in Semarang not
to be unnerved by the painted signs, which have already been
scrubbed away by municipal workers.
	   Indonesia's ethnic Chinese minority was heavily targeted during
May riots in Jakarta and other cities that led to the downfall of
former President Suharto. Many fear fresh unrest.
	   Chinese are resented in part because they dominate commerce, and
many Indonesians are becoming poorer as a year-old economic crisis
deepens, stripping millions of their jobs.
	   The signs found in Semarang include a triangle, which reportedly
identifies a building as a target for looters. Residents say a
circle symbolizes that women in the building are targets for rape,
the newspaper Media Indonesia reported Wednesday.
	   Women's groups have said that at least 168 women, most of them
ethnic Chinese, were raped during the riots in Jakarta. About 1,200
people were killed.
	   Police say they do not know who painted the signs in Semarang.
Some observers speculate the perpetrators are trying to extort
money from terrified Chinese.
	   Semarang is 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of Jakarta and has a
population of 1.2 million inhabitants, 8 percent of them ethnic
Chinese.

Bears sign Bam Morris
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PLATTEVILLE, Wisconsin (AP) _ Running back Bam Morris, who was
suspended twice for violating the NFL's substance abuse policy and
who spent 89 days in jail this year for marijuana possession, was
signed to a one-year contract by the Chicago Bears.
	   Terms of Tuesday's deal were not disclosed.
	   Morris, 26, rushed for 744 yards (680 meters) in 11 games last
season for the Baltimore Ravens, the team he led in rushing in
1996.
	   With contract talks with first-round draft pick Curtis Enis at
an apparent impasse, the Bears have been looking to add some
backfield help.
	   Morris, who was released by the Ravens in January, played at
Texas Tech where he won the Doak Walker Award as the nation's top
collegiate running back in 1993.
	   He helped lead the Pittsburgh Steelers to the Super Bowl in 1996
and was the game's leading rusher. He was released months later
after his legal troubles began.
	   He originally was arrested near Rockwall, Texas, on March 22,
1996, when a state trooper found 6 pounds (3 kilos) of marijuana in
the trunk of his Mercedes-Benz. That June, he pleaded guilty to
possession of marijuana and prosecutors dropped a more serious
charge of cocaine possession.
	   He was placed on six years' probation, fined dlrs 7,000 and
ordered to perform 200 hours of community service. But he ended up
having to serve jail time after admitting he missed seven meetings
with his probation officer from July 1996 to August 1997.
	   Morris, who had contact with the Kansas City Chiefs recently
only to be told the team wasn't interested in signing him, is the
brother of former Bears wide receiver Ron Morris.

Singapore boss hoped Jehovah's Witness would change beliefs, court
</HEADLINE>
hears &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURINDA KEYS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A vocational school manager testified Wednesday
that he reported a Jehovah's Witness teacher to headquarters for
refusing to salute the flag and sing the national anthem, but did
not report other teachers for similar infractions.
	   The teacher, Peter Nappalli, 37, was fired in 1994 after 10
years of work for the Institute of Technical Education. He is suing
to get back his job, lost pay, and compensation for damages and
violation of his constitutional rights.
	   ``Mr. Nappalli was the only one I reported to headquarters,''
Kok Kam Wah said under cross-examination.
	   There is no national law that Singaporeans must recite the
national pledge and sing the anthem. But government-linked bodies
such as the vocational institute, schools and the military have
such requirements to promote patriotism in the tiny city-state of
3.1 million.
	   Although Nappalli, who now works as a tutor to support his
family, has said his dismissal violates his right to practice his
religion, the trial has focused mostly on the issue of whether the
institute knew of his beliefs before hiring and promoting him.
	   Despite the constitutional freedom for individuals to profess,
practice and propagate their faith, laws in Singapore restrict
those rights. For example, the Jehovah's Witness denomination has
been banned since 1972 from meeting as a group, owning land for a
sanctuary or distributing its religious literature and version of
the Bible.
	   It is legal for individuals to be Jehovah's Witnesses, but they
often run into trouble when they obey the tenets of their faith by
refusing to perform military service, to sing the national anthem
or recite the national pledge. They believe the Bible prohibits
those things.
	   In his testimony, Kok said that while he was waiting for a
response from headquarters, he counseled Nappalli to change his
practice of standing silently during the national pledge and
anthem.
	   ``Although the plaintiff was firm in his beliefs, there was hope
that he could change over,'' said Kok, explaining why he had
continued to urge Nappalli to comply with the school's policy.
	   ``He was a good teacher. I didn't want to lose a good teacher,''
said Kok. ``My belief is that a person can change for his good.''
	   Nappalli has argued that his employers knew from his first
interviews about his refusal to sing the anthem or recite the
pledge. He said they also had the evidence of his national service
record, which shows he spent three years in prison camp for
refusing military duties. Nappalli noted that he received a
promotion in 1993, in a letter written by the same woman who had
issued him a 1991 warning about his failure to perform the national
ceremonies.
	   Nappalli cited other cases to show that sometimes institutions
just let such matters drop rather than pursue the sensitive
religious practice issue.
	   The institute's defense, based on the questions asked in court,
is that Nappalli was not clear in his initial interviews that he
would not recite the pledge or sing the anthem, and that there is
no proof that those who hired him or promoted him during the next
10 years ever looked at the documents in his personnel file that
indicated his Jehovah's Witness beliefs.
	   Copies of the defense's opening arguments and the affidavits of
its witnesses, placed before the court only in writing, were
requested but not made available to the press.
	   The case was expected to end Friday with closing arguments.

Muhammad Ali quits treatment, says he feels used by Florida clinic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WEST PALM BEACH, Florida (AP) _ Muhammad Ali has stopped an
experimental treatment for his Parkinson's disease, saying he felt
used by the Boca Raton clinic where he went for help.
	   For more than a decade, the former heavyweight champion has
suffered from the disease that slowed his reflexes and made it
difficult for him to talk. Ali had received five days of treatments
at the clinic before deciding to quit.
	   Ali criticized Jerry Jacobson, a retired dentist and oral
surgeon with whom Ali began treatments July 28, for not respecting
his privacy.
	   ``I feel I was used to promote their clinic,'' Ali said in a
statement.
	   Jacobson, who said he has invented a breakthrough technology for
regenerating nerve cells, said he was both hurt and saddened by
Ali's reaction.
	   ``I feel really awful. ... it's just that the media came on too
strong and I guess he felt swamped and (Ali's wife, Lonnie) felt
set up, which was not the case,'' Jacobson said Tuesday.
	   Jacobson defended the decision to confirm to the media that Ali
was being treated at his clinic. Jacobson said it was not an effort
to capitalize on the champion's fame.
	   ``This had nothing to do with business,'' Jacobson said. ``All I
wanted from Ali was two weeks to show the efficacy of this
treatment.''
	   Ali has returned to his home in Berrien Springs, Michigan,
assistant Kim Vidt said.

Diana's car sold to American motor museum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The small silver car given to Princess Diana by
Prince Charles as an engagement present has been sold to an
American motor museum via the Internet, the vendor says.
	   Keith Lawson said Tuesday the deal was brokered by Classic Car
Auto Network, a California Internet car dealership, but that the
sale has not been completed yet.
	   He said he did not know which American museum was involved and
could not give the agreed price. But Lawson said he turned down
more lucrative offers to keep the car in the public eye.
	   ``They have come to me with a price and I have said yes. The
sale has not been completed, but this is exactly what I wanted,''
he said.
	   The 1981 Ford Escort Ghia only attracted offers from private
British bidders who wanted to keep it for themselves, he said.
	   ``I was hoping to keep the car in England but nobody came
forward,'' Lawson said. ``The most important thing was for it to go
to a museum. I could have sold it to a lockup in London but if it
is this important and valuable people should be able to see it.''
	   He said he wanted to sell it before the Aug. 31 anniversary of
Diana's death in a Paris car crash because it would be
inappropriate to have it on the market as millions mourned her.
	   Lawson, an antique clock dealer from Scratby in eastern England,
bought the car for his daughter three years ago at a Sotheby's
auction for 6,000 pounds (dlrs 9,800).
	   But since Diana's death, the car's value has rocketed, said
Lawson, and he was forced to sell it because he could not find
anyone to insure it.
	   At the time he put the car up for sale last month, Lawson said
he had refused an offer of more than dlrs 1 million from a Las
Vegas, Nevada, casino.
	   ``I have had some really staggering offers but my main concern
is to get it in a museum. I did not want it going to a casino or to
one man who would lock it away where people couldn't see it,'' he
said.
	   The small vehicle with a silver frog mascot on the hood has more
than 80,000 miles (128,740 kilometers) on it and would probably be
worth around 600 pounds (dlrs 985) without its Diana connection.
	   The silver frog is a copy of the original mascot, which Diana
attached to the hood. She kept the original when she sold the
vehicle.

Illustrious career of Michael Jones may be over
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ After 55 test matches, New Zealand
rugby union forward Michael Jones appears to be joining other
legendary All Blacks Sean Fitzpatrick and Zinzan Brooke as recent
retirees from the sport.
	   A list of injuries, numerous concussions, age and form forced
the All Blacks selectors to axe the 34-year-old Jones from their
26-strong party to travel to South Africa for the Tri Nations test
in Durban on Aug. 15.
	   Their decision casts serious doubt about Jones having any
involvement in next year's World Cup.
	   However, the Iceman, as he is affectionately known, made it
clear Wednesday that he was not retiring and remains available at
all levels.
	   ``Only when I no longer enjoy it, will I stop playing,'' Jones
said.
	   He remains the only player that New Zealand has, with only ever
muted criticism, allowed not to play on Sundays because of his
Christian beliefs.
	   Hailing from the Waitemata club and West Auckland, Jones made
his international debut for Western Samoa against Wales in Apia in
1986.
	   But it wasn't until a year later and the first World Cup in 1987
when he arrived in full glory on the international stage in the
opening game against Italy when he scored the first try of the
tournament at Eden Park.
	   He repeated that feat in the first game of the World Cup at
Twickenham in 1991, but missed the 1995 World Cup because of the
number of Sunday games in South Africa.
	   And no other player has come back from two debilitating knee
injuries _ in 1989 against Argentina, and 1997 against Fiji _ to
return to the All Blacks.
	   Both injuries had slowed him down and then a series of ``freak
injuries'' this year, as he called them, brought the calls for him
to be put to pasture with dignity.
	   All Blacks coach John Hart has found it difficult to relinquish
his grip on Jones, pressing for him to stay on and provide support
for the 22-year-old All Blacks captain Taine Randell.
	   Hart's respect for Jones can only be measured by the deliberate
move he made at Athletic Park, Wellington, in the Tri Nations game
against South Africa when after substituting him he walked to the
bench to personally thank him for his effort.
	   He also led the accolades for Jones, particularly after the All
Blacks first-ever full series win over South Africa in 1996.
	   ``I think you're seeing here today one of the very special
players who has ever played rugby football,'' Hart said at the
time. Fitzpatrick, then captain, spoke in the same vein.
	   ``He has to be one of the greatest players of all time. You just
have to admire the guy, a model player,'' said Fitzpatrick, who
retired with a knee injury this year.
	   Jones was made captain of the Auckland Blues, whom he took to
their third successive final which they lost to the Canterbury
Crusaders on the final whistle this year. (djp)

Encyclopedia to present history of black contributions to

<TEXT>
	   CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts (AP) _ At the turn of the century,
W.E.B. Du Bois proposed an ambitious project: the creation of an
Encyclopedia Africana, a comprehensive history of Africa and people
of African descent throughout the world.
	   Du Bois, a black intellectual and civil rights pioneer, believed
a compendium of black knowledge would help defeat racism by
cataloging blacks' contributions to civilization. He was never able
to raise the funds for his project.
	   Nearly 90 years later, Du Bois' dream is about to become a
reality, both in print and on CD-ROM.
	   In February, Microsoft and a team of African-American studies
scholars working under Harvard professors Henry Louis Gates Jr. and
K. Anthony Appiah will release Microsoft Encarta Africana, a CD-ROM
of the history, geography and culture of Africa and people of
African descent. Later in the year, a print version will be
published by Perseus Books.
	   ``There's never been anything like this before, a comprehensive
encyclopedia of the entire black world,'' said Gates.
	   While other researchers have chronicled different aspects of
African and African-American history, there has never been a
catalogue of this scope, Appiah said.
	   The two professors have tried for years to get financial backing
for the encyclopedia. They began to move ahead on the project three
years ago.
	   The encyclopedia contains 3,000 articles, solicited from over
400 scholars. The multimedia version allows users to experience
parts of black history for themselves.
	   For example, users can take a virtual tour of the notorious
Goree Island in Senegal, a midway point for slaves bound for the
Americas, complete with 360-degree views and video and audio clips.
	   There is a reference to Russian poet Alexander Pushkin's African
great-grandfather and a lengthy piece that traces blacks in Great
Britain back 2,000 years to when Africans first arrived with Julius
Caesar's conquering army.
	   The collection traces the presence of blacks over a
4-million-year span, from the earliest hominids in Africa to poet
Maya Angelou and actress Whoopi Goldberg in present day.
	   Gates and Appiah first discussed the project as students at
Cambridge University in England during the late 1970s. They later
approached the Britannica encyclopedia company with the idea but
were told it lacked financial viability.
	   In the years that followed, both became giants in the field of
African-American studies. They returned to the encyclopedia idea
three years ago and secured the support of several high-profile
blacks, including musician/producer Quincy Jones, who helped
bankroll the project in its early stages.
	   Microsoft executives were intrigued by the idea and agreed to
produce a CD-ROM version, one day after Gates and Appiah inked the
deal with Perseus.
	   It is Microsoft's first spin-off from its popular Encarta line,
a general reference encyclopedia on CD-ROM.
	   ``This is an area that is unique, and when these two guys offer
you the chance with that sort of content, it's hard to turn down,''
said Mark Young, who manages Microsoft's line of learning products.
	   Gates credits the underlying vision of the project to its
originator, 90 years ago.
	   ``To me, there's nothing more fitting of a gift we can give Du
Bois and the African-American people at the end of the century,''
he said.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore has increased the penalties for
various infractions and breakdowns by telephone services in the
island republic, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The Telecommunications Authority of Singapore will now fine
services up to 1 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 580,000),
depending on the length and extent of the interruption, The Straits
Times reported.
	   This is double the previous maximum fine, and in direct response
to a massive paging and mobile phone disruption last year that was
later attributed to Singapore Telecom, which is 89 percent
government-owned and the sole operator of fixed line services in
the island republic.
	   The telecommunications watchdog's new penalties became effective
Tuesday, along with a new code of practice on service standards.
	   Singapore is in the process of opening up its previously
monopolistic, state-run telecommunications industry. In addition to
Singapore Telecom, there are now two other pager operators, one of
which also offers a mobile phone service.
	   The fixed line market will expand in 2000 with the entry of a
consortium comprising British Telecom, Japan's NTT and local
partners Singapore Power and Singapore Technologies Industrial.

Three executed for murder in Shanghai
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Authorities in Shanghai have executed
three people for murder, the official newspaper Liberation Daily
reported Wednesday.
	   Xie Zhiqiang, who was involved in an extramarital affair, was
sentenced to death for murdering his daughter and wife,
dismembering their bodies and scattering the parts in a river, the
report said.
	   Tang Yulin was convicted of fatally battering a coworker with an
iron bar because he suspected the man of causing him to lose his
job, and Bian Baojian was found guilty of killing a man who awoke
and interrupted him while Bian was burgling his house, it said.
	   The report said the three were executed shortly after sentencing
Tuesday by Shanghai's No. 2 Intermediate Court.

Thailand may have to pay for gas it can't take from Myanmar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand may have to pay Myanmar for
gas it can't take from a dlrs 1.2 billion pipeline because a power
plant near Bangkok isn't ready to receive it, the Petroleum
Authority of Thailand said Wednesday.
	   Gas from the Yadana Pipeline, which is owned by Total of France,
Unocal of the United States, Myanmar's military government and the
Petroleum Authority of Thailand, began flowing through the pipeline
last Thursday.
	   However, because a powerful generator has yet to be installed at
a power plant in Ratchaburi, 95 kilometers (59 miles) west of
Bangkok, Thailand can take only 5 million to 10 million cubic feet
of gas each day, a PTT spokesman said.
	   The contract, however, calls for Thailand to take between 65
million and 325 million cubic feet a day.
	   ``We are obligated to pay for the gas we are committed to take
under the contract,'' said the PTT spokesman, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
	   That could amount to several million dollars a year. The
pipeline was projected to generate dlrs 400 million each year,
according to officials of Total.
	   PTT is seeking to reinterpret the contract with its partners so
that it won't have to pay for gas it doesn't receive, the newspaper
Bangkok Post quoted company officials as saying.
	   PTT said it was waiting for the Electricity Generating Authority
to install the generator, but didn't know when the work would be
completed _ probably sometime next year.
	   Democracy activists have accused the pipeline's owners of using
forced labor to build infrastructure for the project and say its
profits will fund weapons buying by Myanmar's military government.
	   Thai environmentalists opposed the project on the grounds that
it cuts through rain forests and has displaced animals, including
elephants, the Thai national symbol.
	   ``Had the PTT listened to the environmentalists, we would not
have wasted a large amount of money while saving our fertile
forest,'' Piphob Dhongchai, a conservation activist, was quoted as
saying in Wednesday's Bangkok Post.

Death toll from floods rises to 62; 34 still missing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Rescuers plucked two more bodies from
river estuaries on South Korea's south coast Wednesday, raising the
death toll from weekend flash floods to 62.
	   But as weeping family members watched from river banks,
authorities expressed concern that some of the 34 people still
missing may never be found.
	   ``This is turning into a prolonged search,'' said Kim Byong-gon,
a relief organizer at the Home Ministry.
	   Nearly all of the dead or missing were campers swept away by
raging torrents triggered by heavy rains in scenic Mount Chiri
National Park over the weekend. The park is 200 kilometers (125
miles) south of Seoul.
	   Disaster relief headquarters earlier had reported up to 50
people missing but the number dropped sharply after families
reported the return of some missing relatives.
	   Weather forecasters failed to predict the torrential rains. Many
camping families were engulfed while trying to flee in their cars.
	   Most of the bodies so far recovered were found miles downstream.
Officials feared some bodies may have been carried as far as the
sea, 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the park.

<TEXT>
	   KLAIPEDA, Lithuania (AP) _ Takoma the dolphin skipped across the
water, executed some stunning turns and got a reward of fish from
his handler. Although it looked like an aquarium show, it was
deadly serious: a search for explosives in the some of the world's
most heavily mined waters.
	   The dolphin was one of five brought to the Baltic Sea by the
U.S. military to take part in recent military exercises _ the first
time U.S.-trained mine-seeking dolphins have been deployed in
Europe.
	   The use of the dolphins is one demonstration of how seriously
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia take the task of clearing their
waters of mines placed there during two world wars, when the Baltic
republics were key battlegrounds and supply routes.
	   Experts estimate that 30,000 mines still lurk in the waters off
the three countries _ the heaviest concentration of underwater
mines anywhere. At one time, as many as 85,000 mines were there.
	   No ships have reported damage from mine explosions in the area,
but the former Soviet republics aren't taking chances. Making their
waterways as safe as possible is an element in their struggle to
revive their economies after 50 years of Soviet rule.
	   ``The goal of all three of the Baltic governments is ambitious.
They want to investigate every bay and waterway. They want to be
absolutely sure there's nothing there,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Ingemar
Elofsson of the Swedish navy, which has led the mine-clearing
effort.
	   That's a substantial task, especially in Estonia, with its
jigsaw coastline, tangled skein of narrow waterways and more than
1,000 offshore islands. The coasts of Latvia and Lithuania are much
straighter.
	   Although main waterways have already been swept, mine clearers
say it's important to make sure that no mines remain in smaller
waterways because they could become dislodged and drift into the
main channels.
	   Another concern, said Elofsson, is that mines could wash onto
beaches, where curious civilians could set them off inadvertently.
	   The five dolphins have been trained to use their natural sonar
to find mines that could otherwise go undetected because of signal
interference.
	   After World War II ended, the Western countries with Baltic
shores carried out extensive operations to clear mines from their
waters. The mine-clearing efforts in the Soviet-run Baltics,
however, were haphazard and eventually ended.
	   After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the Baltic countries
assumed more political and commercial importance for their Nordic
neighbors, which undertook substantial aid programs, including
mine-clearing.
	   Led by Swedish forces, the operations have destroyed several
thousand mines since 1994 and have opened a once-unusable waterway
that could cut ferry travel time between the Estonian and Latvian
capitals by eight hours.
	   With tens of thousands of mines still out there, the countries
are looking for new techniques to speed the process. The clever sea
mammals were supposed to find mines and place floats over them to
guide demolition crews.
	   Despite the failure of the dolphins to find even one mine in a
four-day trial, Elofsson said efforts would continue. Some
disappointed observers said the Baltic may have been too chilly for
the dolphins.
	   ``Three or four years,'' Elofsson said when asked how long he
expected the project to take. ``Or maybe much longer. Who knows?''

Sell-off of China's state firms under scrutiny
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Signaling a top-level reassessment of sweeping
state enterprise reforms, the leading state-run newspaper warned
Wednesday that uncontrolled sales of small government-owned
companies were behind swelling unemployment and ``serious social
problems.''
	   Local leaders who are unloading state companies at fire-sale
prices are pushing corporate reforms in the ``wrong direction,''
the People's Daily said in a front-page editorial.
	   Such editorials are approved by the upper echelons of the ruling
Communist Party.
	   It urged local governments to try other methods to revive
money-losing state companies, such as merging with more profitable
enterprises or issuing equity to shareholders.
	   The speedy liquidation of state enterprises has generated more
layoffs than government employment programs can handle, and ``in
some areas, this has led to serious social problems,'' the
editorial said.
	   China's state enterprises incurred net losses of 11 billion yuan
(dlrs 1.33 billion) in the first five months of the year.
	   Banks, already saddled with huge bad debts, are wary of lending
to state corporations, and foreign investment has slowed,
compelling authorities to strike cheap deals to get funds for
cash-starved factories.
	   In the depressed northeastern city of Shenyang, for example,
authorities are offering some companies for pennies in a desperate
attempt to bring in new ownership. At stake are desperately needed
tax revenues. Revitalized companies _ whether state-owned or
private _ pay local government taxes. Money losers can't.
	   The sale of state assets at prices deemed to be below fair value
has alarmed central government authorities, despite their vows to
carry through with painful reforms needed to make state companies
profitable.
	   ``Some places don't provide careful evaluations of a company's
assets and are arbitrarily reducing the prices,'' the editorial
said.
	   It accused local governments of giving away assets and of
disregarding the welfare of laid-off workers. It noted that writing
off debts to lure investors was prohibited.

Electricity restored in Chechnya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After a three-day power outage, the electricity
supply to much of the breakaway republic of Chechnya was restored
Wednesday, a news report said.
	   Unidentified attackers fired on an electrical substation on
Sunday, damaging transmission lines and cutting power.
	   Workers reconnected a cable between the republic's capital
Grozny and nearby Ingushetia early Wednesday, restoring power to
all but a few mountain regions, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Chechnya's infrastructure was badly damaged in the republic's
1994-1996 war with Russia, and power sub-stations continue to come
under periodic attack.

China struggles to cope with deadly flooding
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with tropical storm weakening in grafs 3-4, more
details on Jiayu floods in grafs 15-19, slight editing to trim &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JIAYU, China (AP) _ First came a rushing sound and warning
cries. The local TV station interrupted its broadcasts to warn
people to flee. Then came the wall of water that drowned homes and
fields.
	   Four days after a dike protecting it collapsed, Jiayu County in
central China's Hubei province was struggling Wednesday with the
aftermath of some of the worst of an unusually destructive season
of summer flooding that has already killed at least 1,288 people.
	   Already badly hit provinces in the south and east were warned to
brace for possible further flooding from tropical storm Otto, which
barreled into Fujian province on the southeast coast Wednesday
after killing at least one person in Taiwan.
	   Officials had warned that Otto's winds and heavy rains might
cause flood-weakened dikes to collapse. The State Meteorological
Bureau, however, said Wednesday that Otto was losing strength as it
headed inland, although it still brought heavy rains.
	   The death toll from Saturday's floods in Jiayu caused by the
sudden levee collapse remained unclear Wednesday. County officials
said they were concentrating on rescuing and resettling the living,
not counting the dead or injured.
	   A Hong Kong-based human rights group claimed Tuesday that more
than 1,000 people were believed missing.
	   Officials denied Wednesday that so many people were lost, but
said casualty figures were still being compiled. One official said
people were killed, another said there were no fatalities. Many
indicated it was too early to tell.
	   An official newspaper, the Hubei Daily, said Wednesday that 19
soldiers were missing. One of the paper's affiliates, Chutiandusi,
said Tuesday that 148 people had been killed in flooding in all of
Hubei province.
	   In Jiayu, people whose homes were flooded said the water came
suddenly. Some said they heard a rushing sound, others heard
warning shouts. On Wednesday, just a few roofs poked through the
waters. Most houses were completely submerged.
	   Some people were living in plastic lean-tos. Other survivors
were moved into farmers' houses or school buildings vacated for the
summer holidays, said a Jiayu government official. Like most
officials, he refused to give his name.
	   He said the majority of the 57,000 people who were flooded out
had been resettled, and the government was providing food and
water.
	   Paizhou and Hezhen, the two towns in Jiayu that were flooded,
lie along the Yangtze, the world's third-largest river. This year,
the river has risen to levels unseen since flooding in 1954 killed
more than 30,000 people.
	   Yangtze floodwaters, caused by summer rains that fell heavier
and earlier than usual, have displaced millions of people and
inundated vast stretches of rich farmland. Millions of soldiers and
civilians are toiling on the Yangtze's dikes, watching for signs of
collapse and plugging leaks.
	   So far, the main Yangtze levees have reportedly remained intact,
but secondary levees like that in Jiayu have been breached. In at
least one instance, small dikes have been deliberately abandoned to
divert floodwaters away from the Yangtze, in a bid to lower the
river level and protect cities downstream.
	   Before it collapsed, the embankment in Jiayu had sprung a leak a
few days earlier that was not plugged effectively, the Yangcheng
Evening News reported.
	   One of those swept away by the floodwaters was Maj. Gen. Dai
Yingchong, who was leading a group of more than 400 soldiers, the
official newspaper said.
	   ``I was sucked down twice by the waves, but struggled back to
the surface each time and finally grabbed a poplar tree,'' it
quoted the general as saying. ``I saw that in the surrounding trees
there also were a few other soldiers who had been swept away.''
	   After the levee collapse, the newspaper said, soldiers in boats
sought out survivors, shouting ``Is anyone there? Is anyone
there?'' as they passed submerged houses.
	   Three helicopters dropped life jackets, and more than 150 boats
were used to pick up survivors, the Hubei Daily said.

For Gadhafi, donning a religious robe offers many solutions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY187 &QL; 
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AL-BAYDA, Libya (AP) _ Once a staunch secularist, Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi lately has been organizing mass religious meetings,
appearing on state television kneeling in prayer and whispering
verses from the Koran.
	   His new-found spirituality may be rooted in political
pragmatism.
	   Libya expert Dirk Vanderwalle of Dartmouth College in New
Hampshire says Gadhafi has a mixture of aims in emphasizing Islam:
	   _Using religion as a bond of brotherhood, Gadhafi is making
overtures to African Muslim nations to help him overturn U.N.
sanctions against Libya.
	   _Seeking to fight fire with fire, he wants to cut back the
influence of Islamic militants who are trying to overthrow him.
	   _Gadhafi is telling potential business partners in Europe that
only he can eliminate the danger of extremism in his country and
safeguard lucrative foreign oil investments.
	   Since seizing power in a bloodless 1969 coup, Gadhafi has
created a unique, quirky system of governance called the
Jamahiriya, or people's rule. A former army colonel, Gadhafi holds
no official title, and is referred to as ``brother leader.''
	   In theory, the Jamahiriya is a blend of Islam, socialism and
nationalism that vests power in the people through grassroots
committees. But in reality, Gadhafi retains all power and any
change must come from him.
	   A look around Libya reveals change is indeed under way.
	   Gadhafi is celebrating religious holidays on a lavish scale and
is appearing more often in a traditional Islamic robe. Billboards
emphasizing the virtues of the Jamahiriya now jostle for space on
Libyan streets with giant signs advertising the role of Islam.
	   ``The Koran is the basis of society,'' announced one such sign
in al-Bayda, an eastern coastal city to which Gadhafi invited
African and Arab leaders last month for a mass prayer celebrating
the birthday of the prophet Mohammed.
	   In May, Gadhafi prayed with eight African leaders and thousands
of other Muslims in the capital of Chad; last year, he organized
mass prayers in Niger and Nigeria.
	   The gatherings carried messages beyond Islam.
	   Gadhafi flew to the sessions, defying a 6-year-old U.N. air
embargo imposed to force Libya to hand over two men wanted in the
1988 explosion of a Pan Am jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, that
killed 270 people.
	   Gadhafi, who has invested Libya's oil wealth in gold mines and
other projects in Africa, has received support for lifting the
sanctions from African and Arab officials.
	   The presidents of Chad, Niger and Burkina Faso recently flew
into Libya, and the 54-nation Organization of African Unity has
declared that it no longer recognizes the U.N. embargo. The
22-member Arab League has called for an end to the sanctions.
	   Gadhafi also has been pushing for European investment as a way
to end Libya's isolation. Italy, which is heavily dependent on
Libyan oil and gas, signed an agreement last month with Libya on
fighting terrorism and other measures.
	   Wahid Abdel-Meguid of the Al-Ahram Center for Strategic and
Political Studies, an Egyptian think tank, said Gadhafi's emphasis
on Islam is a response to the opposition he faces at home from
Muslim militants.
	   ``Raising religious slogans is the easiest (thing) a regime
resorts to when it faces trouble,'' Abdel-Meguid said.
	   Still, it's difficult to judge the strength of Libya's Islamic
militants, because the government largely controls the news. Libya
has denied reports of militant attacks _ including an alleged June
assassination attempt on Gadhafi _ or blamed them on common
criminals.
	   George Joffe of London's Royal Institute of International
Affairs says the militants see Gadhafi ``as an incompetent ruler,
as a heretic.''
	   But others feel Gadhafi is exaggerating the problem of Islamic
radicals as an excuse to crush all opposition _ including that by
ordinary Libyans angry over hardships brought on by U.N. economic
sanctions and falling oil prices.
	   Abdel-Hamid Bakkoush, a former Libyan premier and a prominent
dissident now living in Cairo, Egypt, said there is no Islamic
militant movement in Libya, just an ``ordinary opposition'' that is
weak and disorganized.

Dollar lower against yen, Tokyo stocks slip
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with later afternoon bond and currency rates &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar sank to its lowest level against
the yen in about a week Wednesday following a plunge in New York
stocks overnight.
	   Tokyo stocks also fell, but hopes for economic rescue measures
at home limited losses.
	   The dollar sank as low as 143.38 yen in Tokyo trading, its
weakest level since 141.75 last Thursday.
	   The U.S. currency was quoted at 143.86 yen in late afternoon,
down 0.81 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and lower than its late
New York rate of 144.97 yen overnight.
	   The U.S. currency fell after the Dow Jones industrial average
recorded its biggest point loss of the year in New York Tuesday.
The yen, meanwhile, was helped by optimism that proposed tax cuts
in Japan could help revive the sagging economy.
	   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and senior policy makers of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party agreed Tuesday on a plan to cut
personal income taxes next year by about 4 trillion yen (U.S. dlrs
27.7 billion) and corporate taxes by 2 trillion yen (dlrs 13.8
billion).
	   Also helping the yen were comments Wednesday by the head of the
Finance Ministry's International Bureau, reiterating that Japan
supports a strong domestic currency.
	   Asked by reporters about the dollar's drop below 144 yen in
early trading, Haruhiko Kuroda said, ``I still don't think that
(the excessive yen weakness) has been corrected.''
	   On the Tokyo stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
lost 31.42 points, or 0.20 percent, closing at 15,992.16. On
Tuesday, the Nikkei had fallen 141.50 points, or 0.88 percent.
	   Shares prices sank from the opening bell after the Dow dropped
299.43 points, or 3.41 percent, to 8,487.31, but the decline was
limited amid hopes Japan's new government would move quickly to
boost the economy.
	   Electronics companies and international exporters were mostly
weaker following the plunge by their U.S. counterparts. But a rise
in some bank stocks helped offset the declines as bargain hunters
moved in following recent heavy losses in financial shares.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section gained 1.17 points, or 0.09 percent, to 1,235.78. It
had declined 10.63 points, or 0.85 percent, the previous day.
	   Trading on the exchange's main section was estimated at 363
million shares, up from 356.35 million Tuesday. Declines
outnumbered advances 623 to 476, while 180 issues were unchanged.
	   Some investors hesitated to place bets on the market's movement
before a key policy speech Friday by Japan's new prime minister,
Keizo Obuchi, traders said.
	   In Obuchi's speech to Parliament, traders and investors are
looking for indications the government will be able to promptly
implement the promised tax cuts and pass bills to revitalize the
ailing financial industry.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.225 percent from Tuesday's close of 1.220
percent, driving its price down to 111.61 yen from 111.66 yen.

Havel stable, but pneumonia and irregular heart rate persist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech President Vaclav Havel was
in stable condition Wednesday, but doctors worried about lingering
pneumonia and irregularities of the president's heart function.
	   ''Pneumonia has not yet been suppressed,'' Havel's doctor Ilja
Kotik told the CTK news agency, adding the president's temperature
lingered around 38 degrees Celsius.
	   ''Irregularities of the heart rhythm appear every now and then
but they are not dramatic and are caused by pneumonia,'' Kotik
said.
	   The Czech leader suffered a ruptured colon in April while
vacationing in the Austrian Alps. He underwent emergency surgery
and a colostomy was performed.
	   On July 26, a combined Austrian-Czech team of doctors closed the
colostomy in Prague. Havel developed pneumonia related to the
operation on Monday.
	   Havel's condition worsened Tuesday as his heart rate soared, but
doctors were able to stabilize his condition with electric shocks.
	   For two hours, the 61-year-old president fell into critical
condition because of blood poisoning caused by pneumonia. His heart
rate hit 200 beats per minute.
	   Kotik said Wednesday doctors contemplated changing the type of
antibiotics administered to Havel to suppress his body temperature.
	   Havel, a former chain smoker and veteran of communist jails, has
suffered from chronic bronchitis for years.
	   He has been hospitalized five times since December 1996 when a
third of his lung and a cancerous tumor were removed.
	   The Czech presidency is a largely ceremonial position, so while
Havel is hospitalized there is no need for his powers to be
transferred to someone else.
	   Should he be unable to return to office, parliament would
nominate a new president.

Iraqi Parliament speaker calls for ending cooperation with U.N.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's Parliament speaker urged President
Saddam Hussein on Wednesday to suspend all cooperation with United
Nations weapons inspectors if the eight-year-old U.N. sanctions
against the country are not lifted.
	   The statement by Sadoun Hammadi at a special session of the
National Assembly came amid a new argument with the weapons
inspectors in charge of determining if Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction.
	   The Assembly was called into session to consider an unspecified
plan by Saddam to end the sanctions, which were imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait and block the country from freely
exporting its most valuable commodity, oil.
	   The Iraqi News Agency reported Saddam's plan Tuesday after U.N.
chief weapons inspector Richard Butler cut short a visit to
Baghdad, saying Iraq was refusing to continue disarmament talks.
The agency gave no details of Saddam's plan but said it would be
announced soon.
	   Hammadi, in his speech, referred to a resolution adopted in
November by the 250-member Assembly, which called for a complete
halt to cooperation with the weapons inspection program if the
sanctions were not lifted in six months.
	   ``The solution lies in the application by the leadership of the
Assembly's resolution, '' Hammadi said. ``We see that the
resolution should have been implemented ... and now we call for the
implementation.''
	   The Assembly, whose members virtually all support Saddam, are
expected to approve his plans for dealing with the sanctions, which
cannot be lifted until U.N. inspectors certify Iraq has destroyed
its chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles.
	   The new confrontation with Butler follows a long series of
disagreements in which Iraq has insisted it has eliminated all
lethal weapons while the inspectors accused it of continuing to
hide dangerous arms.
	   It throws into doubt the future of the inspection program
launched in 1991 to uncover Iraq's arsenal. In New York, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said the next step would come only
after Butler's report to the Security Council, expected Thursday.
	   Butler said Tuesday that the latest impasse arose in a meeting
Monday in which Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz demanded that U.N.
inspectors give Iraq a clean bill of health on destruction of its
most dangerous arms.
	   ``I told him that I cannot fulfill your demand because I don't
have the evidence,'' Butler said after flying into Bahrain en route
to New York. ``After I said that to him, Aziz replied, `Then we
can't talk any further.'''
	   Butler's political adviser, Gustavo Zlauvinen, said Aziz also
refused to accept a proposal to speed up the pace of weapons
inspections. ``The talks were getting nowhere,'' he said.
	   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin
said Saddam had ``shot himself in the foot'' by mishandling a
chance to end economic sanctions. ``Iraq has only harmed itself,''
Rubin said.
	   Iraq's official newspapers stressed anew, meanwhile, that U.N.
weapons inspectors were cooperating in American plots against
Saddam's government by refusing to confirm that the country had
eliminated its weapons systems.
	   The government daily Al-Jumhuriya indicated Iraq would persist
in refusing to cooperate with the U.N. Special Commission in charge
of the weapons inspections.
	   ``If the Special Commission does not plan to stop plotting
against Iraq, then there is ... no sense in continuing this
cooperation,'' it said in an editorial.
	   It said what weapons are left, ``if any,'' can be controlled by
long-term monitoring devices already in place.
	   The daily Al-Thawra, the official paper of Saddam's ruling
party, ridiculed the idea that Iraq should be considered a threat
after the years of work by the inspectors.
	   ``After seven years of inspections, monitoring, obtaining
documents, destroying factories and ... searching presidential
sites, they say that Iraq is a threat,'' said the paper.

Kurdish rebels kill 15 Turkish soldiers in raid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Kurdish guerrillas attacked Turkish
soldiers in the remote southeastern mountains on the Iraqi border,
killing 15 and injuring 25, according to newspaper reports
Wednesday.
	   The guerrillas, who were members of the Kurdistan Workers Party,
or PKK, also kidnapped 10 soldiers after the attack on Mt. Kato
along the border with Iraq, the daily Cumhuriyet said.
	   Hundreds of troops, reinforced by helicopters, retaliated,
killing at least four rebels, according to the daily Hurriyet.
	   Military officials could not be reached for comment.
	   The soldiers were stationed on Mt. Kato to seal guerrilla escape
routes into northern Iraq. The mountain, in the province of Sirnak,
which is about 1,200 kilometers (720 miles) southeast of Ankara, is
known as one of the strongholds of the estimated 1,500 Kurdish
rebels operating inside Turkey.
	   Some 37,000 people have died in the PKK's fight for autonomy in
southeastern Turkey since 1984.

DeBakey says his mother's sewing helped invent heart devices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Renowned surgeon Michael DeBakey says he
credits much of his success in inventing heart devices to
engineering and his mother's sewing.
	   ``I read several books on engineering and with the help of the
Dacron which my mother used for sewing, I managed to create the
tubes'' for heart pumps, the 91 year-old DeBakey was quoted as
saying.
	   DeBakey, a Lebanese-American pioneer in artificial heart
research, made his comments to the London-based Arabic newspaper
Al-Hayat after a trip to his family's hometown of Marjayoun. He is
on his second visit to Lebanon in less than a year.
	   He was the first surgeon to implant a partial artificial heart
in a patient nearly 40 years ago. He also is among the developers
of a new generation of smaller, more reliable heart pumps.
	   A professor and researcher at Baylor University in Houston,
Texas, DeBakey most recently has helped develop a new Ventricular
Assist Device to provide long-term care to patients with congestive
heart failure. It's expected to be tested on humans within a year.

Nobel laureates urge Myanmar to hold dialogue with Aung San Suu

Kyi &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Myanmar's military leadership should
open a dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi and restore all democratic
freedoms, six Nobel Prize laureates say.
	   Their statement was released Tuesday by the Stockholm-based
International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance. Suu
Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner, is a member of the
organization's board.
	   The statement was signed by peace prize laureates Jose
Ramos-Horta, Oscar Arias Sanchez, Desmond Tutu and Lech Walesa; and
literature winners Derek Walcott and Nadine Gordimer.
	   The government of Myanmar, also known as Burma, has held
democracy activist Suu Kyi under house arrest, or closely confined
her activities, since 1990. Last week, she was detained while

	   ITZHAR, West Bank (AP) _ The shooting deaths of two Israeli
settlers as they patrolled their settlement on Wednesday prompted
right-wing calls for a suspension of talks with Palestinians.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu planned to discuss the
shootings with his 12-member security Cabinet later Wednesday amid
calls that he freeze negotiations until Palestinians hand over the
attackers.
	   Aviv Bushinsky, spokesman for Netanyahu, said the prime minister
takes a ``very grave view'' of the attack that killed two Jewish
seminary students.
	   ``He said that this proves the necessity of protecting the
security interests of the settlers in the negotiations with the
Palestinians,'' Bushinsky said.
	   Nabil Amr, an adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
member of the elected legislative council, said the attack
underlined the need for ``serious ideas'' from Israel to move the
peace process forward.
	   ``If Israel continues to waste time then that means we are
leaving the field open for others to do everything they want to end
the whole process, just like what happened last night,'' he said on
Israel Radio's Arabic service.
	   Following the shootings, Israel placed a curfew on five
surrounding Palestinian villages and closed roads leading to the
large Palestinian-run city of Nablus as troops searched the area
for the shooters.
	   Negotiations have been stalled for months over a U.S. proposal
for Israel to withdraw from an additional 13 percent of the West
Bank, a move that would leave many settlements as islands inside
Palestinian-controlled zones.
	   Netanyahu, under pressure from the strong Jewish settler lobby
and right-wing members of his Cabinet, has insisted on changes in
the American plan, including more stringent counter-terrorism
measures by Palestinians.
	   In his latest offer, Netanyahu proposed withdrawing from 10
percent of the territory and turning an additional 3 percent into a
nature reserve where Israel's army would retain overall security.
But Arafat rejected the Israeli proposal on Tuesday.
	   Jewish settler leaders said even a 10 percent withdrawal would
have left Itzhar cut off and surrounded by Palestinian-controlled
territory. They said Wednesday's killings were a harbinger of
things to come if the pullback goes through.
	   ``This is a tragic example of what is likely to occur ten-fold
when troop redeployments are carried out. Itzhar and 18 other
settlements will be turned into isolated islands,'' said settler
council leader Ahron Dombe. He called on Netanyahu to cancel talks
until the assailants were found.
	   Michael Kleiner, a supporter of the settlers in the Israeli
Knesset, called for convening the 120-member parliament, which is
now in summer recess, and debating a proposal to stop talks with
the Palestinians until Arafat's government hands over the attackers
to Israel. He also demanded Israel not go through with a reported
plan to free 100 Palestinian prisoners.
	   Killed in the attack were Harel Binoun, 18, and Shlomo Livman,
24, both sons of prominent rabbis and students at the Joseph's tomb
seminary in the heart of Nablus _ a focal point of past
confrontations between Palestinians and Jewish settlers.
	   Moshe Yaalon, the army's West Bank commander, said the two
Israelis were patrolling in a pickup truck outside the settlement
about midnight when they were shot by two attackers laying in
ambush.
	   One of the Israelis was carrying a weapon, reportedly an M-16
assault rifle, which was taken by the ambushers.
	   ``The terrorists apparently had planned this attack and knew
when the pickup truck would be coming by. They firing was carried
out from very close range,'' he said.
	   The four-wheel drive vehicle was riddled with bullets, and
Israel army radio said the attackers repeatedly fired into the
bodies of the Israelis to make sure they were dead.

Singapore rebuts Malaysian allegations over checkpoint dispute

ELIMINATES use of `refute' in headline, grafs 2 and 8 &QL; 
 &UR; By JONATHAN DRAKE &QC;

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore has hit back at Malaysia, accusing
its northern neighbor of making unsubstantiated allegations in a
border dispute between the two Southeast Asian allies.
	   A Home Affairs Ministry spokesman on Tuesday denied five
assertions made by Malaysia since Singapore relocated its
immigration, customs and quarantine post Saturday against the
wishes of its larger neighbor, a government statement said.
	   Malaysia has condemned the move and kept its immigration
officers at the original Tanjong Pagar railway station bordering
Singapore's financial district in the south of the island, a move
Singapore has deemed unlawful and counterproductive.
	   The increasingly acrimonious argument has aggravated
progressively souring relations between the two nations.
Longstanding unresolved issues include land disputes and the sale
of Malaysian water, on which Singapore depends heavily.
	   But the nations are also partners in the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, a regional body that also includes Brunei,
Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.
	   In a blunt statement, the Home Affairs Ministry said
``unsubstantiated allegations from Malaysia, blaming everything on
Singapore, are nothing new.''
	   ``We can only conclude that those who make such allegations do
not know the facts or have chosen to disregard them,'' the
statement added.
	   Responding to claims that the relocation was sudden, unilateral
and deliberately timed when Malaysia was facing an economic crisis,
the spokesman reiterated that the intention to shift the checkpoint
was announced as early as 1989.
	   The spokesman also declared that allegations of Singapore's
arrogance and insensitivity over the issue are ``what Malaysia
usually says when it has no logical arguments to offer.''
	   He said Singapore has every right to locate its immigration
facilities at the border, while Malaysia's about-face on the issue
last year and its demand to remain at the old checkpoint were
themselves arrogant and insensitive.
	   The ministry described the accusation of a ploy to seize the
Malaysian-owned land where Tanjong Pagar is located as ``completely
unfounded,'' and argued that the dispute was a result of Malaysia
repeatedly changing its position on the issue.
	   Finally, the spokesman described as ``absurd'' Malaysian claims
that the Singapore media had an agenda to incite Singaporeans to
hate Malaysia.
	   He said Malaysian media generally had not reported on
Singapore's statements while the city-state's media had reported on
Malaysian statements.
	   The spokesman said that Malaysia has promised to provide within
three months its legal arguments to prove its right to remain at
the old checkpoint.

Prince Charles and the princes vacation in Greece
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Prince Charles and his two sons began the
first full day of their Greek vacation Wednesday nearly one year
after the late Princess Diana cruised the same waters.
	   Charles and Princes William and Harry arrived in Greece late
Tuesday as guests of two billionaire ship owners.
	   The royal visitors are expected to stay on Yiannis Latsis'
122-meter (402-foot) yacht Alexander and then embark on a cruise on
one of Panaghiotis Lemos' yachts.
	   Last August, Diana and her friend Rosa Monckton spent six days
cruising the Saronic Gulf south of Athens and visiting several
islands. Diana, her millionaire beau Dodi Fayed and their chauffeur
were killed Aug. 31, 1997, in a car crash in Paris.
	   The vacation plans for Charles and his sons were not disclosed.
	   The hosts, Latsis and Lemos, are known for protecting the
privacy of their high-profile guests.
	   In July, former U.S. President George Bush and retired U.S. Gen.
Colin Powell and their families arrived in Greece to cruise aboard
Latsis' yacht.

Two bodies found in destroyed apartment house in Berlin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Rescuers found the first two bodies early
Wednesday in the rubble of an apartment house demolished in a
suspected natural gas explosion, and searched for five other
missing residents.
	   Fourteen of the building's 21 residents either were out during
Tuesday's explosion or were rescued shortly after the blast, which
ripped the house off its foundation and sent a huge cloud of dust
over Berlin's Steglitz neighborhood.
	   Hundreds of police and firefighters searched for signs of life
with dozens of dogs and devices that can detect body heat and
sound. Workers also used a crane, bulldozer and other heavy
equipment in the excavation efforts.
	   The body of an elderly woman was taken from the rubble early
Wednesday. A second body was found but had not yet been pulled from
the site, police said.
	   Among those still missing was 13-year-old Sven Tornow, whose
parents anxiously watched rescue efforts.
	   Rescuers on Wednesday began excavating the back room where the
boy was believed buried. His small white dog was found uninjured
and delivered to the hands of the boy's mother.
	   Fire chief Alfred Broemme blamed natural gas for the explosion.
However, police were still investigating the cause.

	   ITZHAR, West Bank (AP) _ Two Israeli settlers were ambushed and
killed as they patrolled an isolated Jewish settlement early
Wednesday, prompting immediate right-wing calls for a suspension of
talks with Palestinians.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was discussing the shooting
with his 12-member security Cabinet on Wednesday amid calls that he

	   Netanyahu, under pressure from the strong Jewish settler lobby
and right-wing members of his Cabinet, has insisted on changes in
the American plan, including more stringent counter-terrorism
measures by Palestinians.
	   Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel said two of the
measures Israel was insisting on were keeping control of roads used
by settlers and confiscation of illegal weapons from Palestinian
militants. ``The murder of these two Israelis is directly connected
to these two issues,'' he said.
	   ``If we can't have security along the roads _ if the
Palestinians are not going to gather up illegal arms in the hands
of terrorists _ then we will not be able to make this peace process
work.''
	   Palestinian legislator Ziad Abu Zayyad noted, however, that the
shootings occurred on land that is still under full Israeli
control, and complained that Israel has failed to stop the
smuggling of weapons from Israel to the West Bank.
	   Abu Zayyad said Netanyahu's government was responsible for the
killings because it ``caused the failure of the peace process.''
	   ``As long as Israeli settlers are living inside the Palestinian
territories and among the Palestinian population, these things will
happen,'' he said.
	   In his latest offer, rejected Tuesday by Arafat, Netanyahu
proposed withdrawing from 10 percent of the territory and turning
an additional 3 percent into a nature reserve where Israel's army
would retain overall security.
	   Jewish settler leaders said even a 10 percent withdrawal would
have left Itzhar _ built on an isolated hilltop in the midst of
Palestinian villages _ cut off and surrounded by
Palestinian-controlled territory. They said Wednesday's killings
were a harbinger of things to come if the pullback goes through.
	   ``This is a tragic example of what is likely to occur 10-fold

ax, as well.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Strongman Hun Sen's ruling party
emerged the winner Wednesday when long-delayed results from last
week's parliamentary election in Cambodia were announced.
	   The Cambodian People's Party won 41.4 percent of the popular
vote, with 2,030,802 votes from 4,902,488 valid ballots cast,
according to figures released by the National Election Committee.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party, the top opposition
group, took 1,554,374 votes, or 31.7 percent, and its ally, the Sam
Rainsy Party, 699,653 votes, or 14.3 percent. The remainder of the
votes were divided among 36 smaller parties, none of which was able
to garner enough support for a seat in parliament.
	   The results appeared to be enough to give the Cambodian People's
Party a majority in the new National Assembly, although an official
breakdown of seats was not announced.
	   The victory of Hun Sen's party in the July 26 poll came as no
surprise, since partial results released over the past week had him
well ahead of his challengers.
	   But FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party have made repeated
allegations that the count was plagued by irregularities.
	   The two parties have called on the election committee to recount
ballots in areas where they suspect irregularities and have
threatened to boycott the new parliamentary session if their
concerns are not met.
	   Without the opposition's attendance, the assembly is unlikely to
have present the two-thirds of its 122 members needed to conduct
any major business.
	   Officials were painstakingly recounting votes in five communes
Wednesday as party activists looked on.
	   It was not clear how many of Cambodia's 1,700 communes would be
counted again, but a handful of opposition politicians said
Wednesday they wanted a total recount.
	   ``They have the right to request the recount of all ballots, but
for this we need a lot of time, money and people,'' said committee
spokesman Samraing Kamsan, adding that he doubted the request would
get very far.
	   Late Tuesday, it became known that committee vice chairman
Kassie Neou had asked to resign as head of the subcommittee
handling recounts.
	   Kassie Neou, a respected human rights worker who considered one
of the few independent voices on the committee, said he was
frustrated by administrative and management problems, NEC spokesman
Samraing Kamsan said.
	   The committee, widely seen as being stacked in favor of Hun
Sen's ruling party, has come under mounting criticism for taking a
passive approach to complaints of irregularities.
	   Election officials abruptly canceled their daily news briefing
Wednesday, delaying the announcement of election results by several
hours.
	   NEC chairman Chheng Phon said in a written statement that
briefings were being terminated because of an impromptu news
conference held by opposition politicians Tuesday at the
committee's media center. Their actions endangered the committee's
spirit of neutrality, he said.
	   The election committee's termination of briefings came after it
had come under sharp questioning from the press. One controversy
involves its formula for allocating parliamentary seats to the
election winners.
	   Only last week did it become generally known that a draft
formula for the calculations had been slightly amended sometime
before the election.
	   The newer method favors the party winning the most seats in any
given district. In practice, this favors the ruling CPP, providing
it with an extra five seats, enough to attain a parliamentary
majority.
	   The committee says the change was legal and approved by the
political parties before the election, but it has been unable to
provide the reasoning behind the change.
	   The election was held one year after Hun Sen ousted FUNCINPEC
leader Ranariddh as his co-premier in a violent coup, shattering a
tense dual premiership formed after the U.N.-sponsored elections in
1993.
	   Hun Sen hoped the polls would win back his legitimacy in the
international arena and aid lost after his power grab.

MTV pulls out of Amsterdam in fee dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Amsterdam became one of the only
European capitals not to receive MTV on Wednesday after the music
channel withdrew from the market in a dispute with the cable
television authority.
	   MTV Europe pulled out Tuesday after refusing to share air time
with two other music and entertainment channels and balking at the
725,000 guilders (dlrs 360,000) a year charge to air its programs.
	   Eurosport and The Discovery Channel have pulled out of Amsterdam
for the same reasons. In a statement, MTV accused the Netherlands
of being ``the only country that charges fees to broadcast on
cable.''
	   Amsterdam already has two Dutch-language music channels,
including the popular Music Factory, and the cable TV authority
said it felt those were enough for the basic 26-channel lineup.
	   MTV, popular in the Dutch capital, which has a lively music
scene, would have been relegated to the midnight to 8 a.m. slot
under new rules drawn up by regulatory officials.

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Thirteen empty cars on a freight train went
off the rails and overturned in southern Ukraine after high
temperatures warped the rails, the Emergency Situations Ministry
said Wednesday.
	   The accident, which occurred near the village of Yavkino, caused
no casualties, the ministry said.
	   Traffic on the railway was restored Wednesday morning.
	   Ukraine has experienced a heat wave in recent days, with
temperatures hitting record highs of 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) in
southern regions. The heat caused the rails to expand, widening the
spaces between them, the ministry said.

Welborn added to Australian squad for South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Former test second rower John Welborn
was Wednesday called into the Australian squad for its Tri Nations
rugby union decider with South Africa after turning down a
lucrative offer from England.
	   Welborn was included in an expanded 25-man traveling squad for
the match in Johannesburg on Aug. 22, along with winger Ben Tune
and prop Richard Harry.
	   Both Tune and Harry have recovered from knee injuries which kept
them from last Saturday's Bledisloe Cup triumph in Christchurch
over New Zealand.
	   Earlier, Welborn announced he'd rejected an offer from leading
English club Bath and would sign on for another Super 12 season
with New South Wales.
	   His decision was swayed by a desire to resume a test career cut
short by injury and to represent Australia at next year's World
Cup.
	   Welborn broke into the test side for the final Tri Nations test
against South Africa in 1996 and then played the next test against
Italy on the end-of-season tour only to suffer a neck nerve injury
that ruled him out for six months and marred his 1997 season.
	   The Wallaby squad will assemble at its Caloundra, Queensland
base on Monday and fly out to South Africa on Aug. 15.
	   The Australian squad: Andrew Blades, Tom Bowman, Matt Burke,
Matt Cockbain, Dan Crowley, John Eales, Owen Finegan, George
Gregan, Nathan Grey, Richard Harry, Daniel Herbert, Tim Horan, Phil
Kearns, Toutai Kefu, Stephen Larkham, Jason Little, Willie
Ofahengaue, Glen Panoho, Jeremy Paul, Joe Roff, Damian Smith, Ben
Tune, John Welborn, David Wilson, Chris Whitaker. (djp)

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Cabinet on Wednesday approved two bills
designed to clean up bad loans in the country's debt-ridden banking
system.
	   One bill would allow the government to take over insolvent banks
and keep them running for up to five years while bad loans and
remaining assets are sold.
	   The so-called ``bridge bank'' plan would be funded by up to 11
trillion yen (dlrs 76 billion) in public funds and is designed to
prevent the failure of a bank from hurting its healthy customers.
	   The bill would allow government-appointed managers of failed
banks to continue making loans to sound borrowers while they look
for buyers.
	   Japanese financial institutions are suffocating under problem
loans estimated at more than 80 trillion yen (dlrs 556 billion),
mostly left over from the collapse of the real estate market in the
early 1990s.
	   The second bill would create a special mediator under the Prime
Minister's Office to resolve conflicting claims on the collateral
backing bad loans. The difficulty of untangling such claims has
been a major obstacle to resolving the bad debt problem.
	   The bills, along with other legislation to clean up the
financial system, were to be be submitted later Wednesday to a
special session of Parliament that ends in October.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Nearly 7,000 businesses have failed in
Thailand in 1998's first seven months as the country's economic
crisis intensified, the Commerce Ministry said Wednesday.
	   Worst hit were retail outlets, hotels and restaurants.
	   The Ministry's Department of Commercial Registration said 6,377
businesses failed between January and the end of July. The total
capital of the companies closed down equaled 16.34 billion baht
(dlrs 398 million).
	   The department said 477 retail stores, hotels and restaurants
went bust, while 193 insurance, financial and other service sector
companies failed and 175 construction companies collapsed.
	   Thailand is in the midst of its worst economic morass in modern
times. Unemployment is expected to reach 2.2 million this year,
despite a dlrs 17.2 billion rescue package from the International
Monetary Fund.
	   ___
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ With Thai demand for fuel shrinking
because of the country's economic crisis, U.S.-based Mobil Oil said
Wednesday it will not build any more service stations in Thailand
and predicted many would close.
	   Mobil Oil Thailand President Duke Keiser forecast that between
2,000 and 2,500 of Thailand's 13,000 service stations will be
forced out of business this year.
	   ``That might not be enough,'' he said. ``The market is not going
to support that number of service stations.''
	   He said the 200 or so stations slated to open this year were the
result of plans made by several oil companies before Thailand's
economic crisis hit in July 1997.
	   Thailand is receiving a dlrs 17.2 billion IMF bailout, but many
in the country are still suffering. Nearly 7,000 businesses have
failed this year and unemployment is expected to reach 2.2 million.
	   Thousands of cars have been repossessed, providing slight relief
from Bangkok's notorious traffic jams.
	   ___
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Germany's FAG Kugelfischer Georg
Schaefer AG agreed Wednesday to set up a joint venture with Hanhwa
Group of South Korea to take over its ball bearing division for
dlrs 214 million.
	   FAG will hold 70 percent of the joint venture company, which
will start operations in October, with the remaining 30 percent to
be held by Hanhwa, the South Korean company said.
	   The new FAG-Hanhwa Bearing Co. will be set up with dlrs 180
million in capital and dlrs 34 million in bank loans to take over
all three ball bearing plants of Hanhwa Machinery Co. Ltd. in South
Korea and their 1,600 employees.
	   Hanhwa Machinery's bearing division controls 40 percent of the
domestic market, reporting dlrs 184 million in sales last year.
	   Hanhwa and other South Korean conglomerates are trying to unload
some of their assets amid a financial crisis that has driven up
interest rates and caused a cash crunch for many businesses.
	   Hanhwa Group is South Korea's eighth largest conglomerate, with
its 26 subsidiaries engaged in chemical, petrochemical, finance and
leisure businesses.
	   ___
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ National Semiconductor Corp. has set up
its Asia Pacific Technology Center in Taiwan, the U.S. company said
Wednesday.
	   The center will develop Cyrix Media GX processor-based
motherboard reference designs and motherboard infrastructure for
Cyrix processors, the company said in a news release.
	   The center will also work with clients in both Taiwan and the
Asia Pacific to define new product platforms, it added.
	   ``The main purpose for setting up the Technology Center in
Taiwan is to be closer to our customers,'' Richard Sanquini, senior
vice president of Cyrix Group, said in the statement.
	   Cyrix is a wholly owned unit of National Semiconductor.

Painted signs add to fears of ethnic Chinese in Indonesian city
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Jakarta governor urging more neighborhood
security ahead of Indonesian independence day Aug. 17 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Amid fears of ethnic violence,
graffiti have appeared on Chinese-owned homes and shops in an
Indonesian city, allegedly marking the buildings for attack.
	   The military has urged ethnic Chinese residents in Semarang not
to be unnerved by the painted signs, which have already been
scrubbed away by municipal workers.
	   Indonesia's ethnic Chinese minority was heavily targeted during
May riots in Jakarta and other cities that led to the downfall of
former President Suharto. Many fear fresh unrest.
	   Gov. Sutiyoso of Jakarta has urged residents to tighten security
in their neighborhoods ahead of Aug. 17, the anniversary of
Indonesian independence. Some demonstrations are expected on that
date.
	   Chinese are resented in part because they dominate commerce, and
many Indonesians are becoming poorer as a year-old economic crisis
deepens, stripping millions of their jobs.
	   The signs found in Semarang include a triangle, which reportedly
identifies a building as a target for looters. Residents say a
circle symbolizes that women in the building are targets for rape,
the newspaper Media Indonesia reported Wednesday.
	   Women's groups have said that at least 168 women, most of them
ethnic Chinese, were raped during the riots in Jakarta. About 1,200
people were killed.
	   Police say they do not know who painted the signs in Semarang.
Some observers speculate the perpetrators are trying to extort
money from terrified Chinese.
	   Semarang is 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of Jakarta and has a
population of 1.2 million, 8 percent of them ethnic Chinese.

British peace activists head for Iraq with medicine for children
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Two British peace activists left for Iraq
Wednesday, carrying medicine worth 400 British pounds (dlrs 650)
for the country's children.
	   In a statement released in the Jordanian capital before they
took the road to Baghdad, Milan Rai, 33, and Andrea Needham, 32,
said they had managed to leave Britain without having their load of
medicine and medical journals confiscated by British customs.
	   ``We hope that this is a sign that the (British) government is
reconsidering its position on sanctions and beginning to put the
health of the children of Iraq at the center of its policies,''
they said in the statement.
	   Under the U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
in 1990, exports of medicine and humanitarian goods must be
authorized by the U.N. sanctions committee.
	   Rai, who belongs to the Voices in the Wilderness group, said
British customs seized a load of medicine destined for Iraq as he
was leaving London in February.
	   Voices in the Wilderness, a group of American and British
activists, have taken several shipments of medicine to Iraq without
asking for U.N. clearance.
	   ``Ordinary Iraqi people are dying as a result of U.N. sanctions
and we cannot accept a moral veto on doing whatever we can to
alleviate their suffering,'' Needham, a nurse, said in the
statement.
	   Needham and Rai said they handed in a letter to 10 Downing
Street on Monday in which they told the British prime minister of
their intention to break the sanctions.
	   A spokeswoman for the group said Rai and Needham would hold a
one-day sit-in and fast in front of the U.N. offices in Baghdad on
Sunday.
	   Last year a U.N. agency reported that almost a million Iraqi
children under the age of five were suffering from malnutrition.

Firefighters struggle to extinguish last fronts of fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Firefighters struggled Wednesday to stamp
out the last fronts of a massive forest fire that reduced large
parts of rare Athens area woodlands to cinders.
	   But authorities expressed concern that a forecasted return of
strong winds could rekindle the fire, which officials have
speculated was started deliberately late Sunday.
	   Hundreds of houses have reportedly been damaged or destroyed in
villages near the foot of Mount Pendeli, about four kilometers (2
1/2 miles) northeast of Athens. The area is one of the last major
tracts of forest ringing Athens.
	   No injuries due to the fires were reported.
	   A summer camp for disabled children on Pendeli was destroyed, as
was a German World War II cemetery and several factories. The
flames also threatened the Athens suburb of Vrilissia.
	   Premier Costas Simitis cut short his vacation and returned to
Athens on Tuesday to assess the situation and coordinate efforts to
extinguish the blaze.
	   Fire officials suspect arsonists started the fire. In the past,
landowners have been accused of starting fires to clear the way for
construction.
	   Meanwhile, fires in other parts of Greece still raged unchecked.
	   Authorities declared a state of emergency in the region of
Messinia, in the southwestern Peloponnese, following the rekindling
of a fire on Mount Taygetos that began last week.
	   The residents of three nearby villages were told to prepare for
possible evacuation, media reported.
	   Local officials expressed fears of an ecological disaster from
the blaze, which has ravaged one of the few remaining untouched
black pine forests in Greece.
	   Two weeks ago, three firefighters and a volunteer firefighter
were killed battling a blaze that scorched the eastern edge of
Athens.
	   Wildfires are common during the hot and dry summers in Greece.
But this season has been called one of the most devastating in
decades, with fires burning daily for the past month.

Arafat presents new cabinet; cited ministers keep their jobs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian Authority President
presented his new Cabinet to lawmakers on Wednesday, promising to
create an independent judiciary and enforce law and order in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   The Palestinian Legislative Council has demanded a Cabinet
reshuffle since publishing a report on widespread corruption in the
Palestinian Authority more than a year ago.
	   However none of the ministers named in the report lost their
jobs in the shakeup.
	   Several legislators said they were dissatisfied with the new
Cabinet and would not vote to approve it.
	   ``This new formulation ... does not fulfill the demands of the
council,'' said Husam Khader, a legislator from the West Bank town
of Nablus.

33 bodies of apparent tsunami victims found off Indonesian coast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Residents of an Indonesian island have
found at least 33 bodies believed to be victims of the deadly
tsunami that smashed into neighboring Papua New Guinea last month,
a news report said Wednesday.
	   The bodies, so decomposed that they could not be recognized,
were found on shores in Biak Numfor regency, a string of islands
off the northern coast of New Guinea, the official Antara news
agency said.
	   On July 17, three devastating waves swept away four villages on
Papua New Guinea's northern coast. At least 2,000 people were
reported killed.
	   Indonesia and Papua New Guinea share New Guinea Island.
Indonesia controls the western part, called Irian Jaya.
	   Last week, fishermen in Irian Jaya found 200 bodies, all
believed to be victims of the tsunami.

Asian markets follow losses on Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS day to Wednesday in first graf &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo HK101 &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asia's stock markets, some already dropping
toward levels they haven't seen in months or years, fell further
Wednesday because of Wall Street's big losses but found support
from what has become an unlikely source _ Japan.
	   The overnight drop of nearly 300 points in the Dow Jones
industrial average was the worst this year and added to concerns
about whether the bull run on Wall Street was reaching an end.
	   Wall Street's sudden drop was at least partly attributed to the
seemingly endless string of bad news from Asia. Back in Asia, it
added an international element to the regional worries about
Japan's new government, China's growth rate, poor corporate
earnings and recession.
	   Japan's inability to shake off years of economic drift and act
like the largest economy in Asia, and second-largest in the world,
has been a drag on the entire region as it tries to right itself
after a very bad year. However, on Wednesday, a stronger yen and
hopes that new Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi would finally turn
things around helped make another dismal day not quite so bad in
Tokyo.
	   In response to the losses on Wall Street, the yen rose in Tokyo
and the dollar fell to its lowest level in about a week. The Nikkei
recouped early losses and closed the day only 31.42 points down, or
0.2 percent, at 15,992.16.
	   Obuchi addresses Parliament on Friday. Tokyo's markets are
looking for signs that his government will move to reform the
finance industry and make good on promises to cut taxes.
	   Because of the influence of the Japanese economy in Asia,
developments in Tokyo often are among the major factors affecting
market movements.
	   Otherwise, there was very little to cheer about in Asia.
	   Some analysts said Asian giants like Hong Kong's HSBC Holdings,
which have buffered their Asian woes with strong returns in the
United States and Britain, now faced the prospect of those topping
out, too.
	   Hong Kong's Hang Seng index, which plunged 4.8 percent on
Monday, resumed its slide Wednesday, closing more than 100 points
down at 7,466.43.
	   The Hang Seng is a little more than 100 points above its low for
the year and 30 percent down since the start of 1998.
	   Manila's market staged a technical rebound after hitting a
five-year low Tuesday and dropping further early Wednesday. The
Kuala Lumpur index in Malaysia is at its lowest level in nine
years, and 70 percent off its high reached in February 1997.
	   Shares were down more than 3 percent at the end of trading in
Seoul, fell to their lowest level in almost two months in Taiwan,
and dropped more moderately in Australia and New Zealand.
	   Hong Kong's market was dragged down by HSBC, which owns Hongkong
Bank and Britain's Midland Bank, and has a majority stake in
another major Hong Kong bank, the Hang Seng Bank.
	   HSBC reported a 16 percent fall in profits this week and a
provision of more than dlrs 1 billion for bad debts. Its stock fell
sharply Monday, and continued its slide during the week as analysts
cut earnings forecasts.
	   John Aitken at Rabobank in London told the South China Morning
Post that HSBC's profit sources in the United States and Britain
``have topped out.''
	   More weak midyear earnings reports were expected Wednesday from
Cathay Pacific airline, and on Thursday from Swire Pacific, which
owns 44 percent of the airline and is heavily invested in the
battered property market.
	   The problems of both the stock and property markets have chopped
a staggering 4 trillion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 516 billion) from
Hong Kong's assets, according to some estimates, and helped plunge
the territory into recession.
	   Hong Kong officials announced Monday that the economy shrank 2.8
percent in the first quarter, and attributed that partly to a fall
in domestic spending.

Russia, Uzbekistan concerned about fighting in Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) _ Russia and Uzbekistan have expressed
concern that fighting in northern Afghanistan could soon send a
wave of refugees fleeing into the former Soviet Union.
	   Russia and Uzbekistan are wary of the Taliban, the
fundamentalist Islamic group that controls about 85 percent of
Afghanistan. The two countries said they would take whatever steps
were necessary to protect their national security, as well as
neighboring countries in Central Asia, the Interfax news agency
said Wednesday.
	   The Taliban religious army is closing in on the northern
opposition stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif, Afghanistan. If there is
heavy fighting, and if the Taliban take the city, many of the
ethnic Uzbeks living in Mazar-e-Sharif may head toward the nearby
Uzbekistan border, officials fear.
	   ``The Taliban movement should halt military actions
immediately,'' said a statement issued in the Uzbek capital
Tashkent after a meeting Tuesday between Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin,
chief of the general staff of the Russian army, and Uzbek
officials.
	   They urged all sides in the fighting to find a peaceful
solution.
	   ``Only Afghans themselves can choose the future of their
homeland, without foreign interference, and put an end to the years
of civil war,'' the statement said.
	   Russia and the former Soviet republics in Central Asia fear that
Afghanistan's lawlessness could spill over into their region,
bringing an increase in refugees, weapons and drugs.

Wild monkeys raid health clinic in northeastern Malaysia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A pack of wild monkeys stormed
into a health clinic in northeastern Malaysia, scaring off patients
and making off with medical equipment, a news report said
Wednesday.
	   ``The monkeys dashed into the clinic despite the staff's
attempts to keep them out,'' said Ahmad Shamsuddin, director of the
Terengganu Wildlife and National Park Department.
	   Ahmad said some of the equipment was destroyed after the monkeys
ransacked the clinic, in Kuala Terengganu, the capital of the
coastal state of Terengganu.
	   Ahmad said the wildlife department had received many complaints
about monkey attacks in residential areas and along the beaches of
the state, a popular tourist spot.
	   The monkey population in the state has increased due to rapid
reproduction by the species, he said, adding there were plans to
relocate some of the monkeys.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new quotes from government spokesman; Congo
accuses Rwanda of sending troops. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; With Analysis-Rwanda-Congo &QL; 
 &UR; By KAMANGA MUTOND &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Laurent Kabila's government on Wednesday
accused neighboring Rwanda of sending troops across its western
border into Congo's eastern Kivu region as part of a Tutsi-led
rebellion.
	   Fighting was reported on Tuesday in Bukavu near the border with
Rwanda and in the village of Kitona on the opposite side of Congo
near the Atlantic coastline. It was unclear whether the fighting
continued through Wednesday.
	   ``Almost 400 army forces have come from Rwanda and have caused
Congolese bloodshed,'' government spokesman Didier Mumengi said.
	   He confirmed heavy fighting in Kitona on Tuesday, but refused to
elaborate on who was in control of the town or its military base.
	   That battle began after rebel gunmen forced the airplane they
had hijajacked to land in Kitona, about 225 kilometers (140 miles)
southwest of Kinshasa.
	   The hijackers were believed to be Banyamulenge fighters in the
eastern city of Goma.
	   Kabila says Rwanda is behind the rebellion in the east. Rwanda
has denied the charge although Rwandan troops _ one-time allies of
Congo's president _ remain in the country against Kabila's wishes.
	   ``Our armed forces will secure the national integrity and will
restore the Congolese dignity and definitely end this fool
adventure,'' Mumengi said.
	   The rebellion began about a week after Kabila ordered all
Rwandan troops out of the country. He did not explain the move.
	   Mumengi called on the international community to monitor
Rwanda's activities and halt the bloodshed in Congo.
	   Rwanda's forces and its Vice President Paul Kagame were
instrumental in helping Kabila's rebel movement oust longtime
Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   That delicate alliance of Kabila's rebels, Rwandan troops and
Banyamulenge Tutsis from Congo has unraveled and now threatens to
topple the current government.
	   Banyamulenge ethnic fighters and Rwandan troops _ both Tutsis _
were leading the uprising against Kabila, accusing him of
widespread corruption and government mismanagement and nepotism.
	   Rwanda has increasingly complained that Kabila has done little
to increase security in the Great Lakes region of central Africa.
	   The vice governor of South Kivu province, Benjamin Serukiza,
said the Tutsi rebels had taken control of much of the province,
including Bukavu and its airport.
	   Kabila convened an emergency cabinet meeting on Tuesday to
discuss the government's response to the rebellion in the east and
to earlier gunbattles at two military barracks in the capital.
	   After he came to power, Kabila kept Rwandan troops on as part of
his defense force until he ordered them out last week. A few days
earlier, he fired his chief military officer, a Rwandan Tutsi
soldier.
	   The ethnic Tutsi population in North Kivu has close links with
Rwanda, and Kabila's support and control of the region has been
faltering for months.

Czech president stable, but pneumonia and irregular heart rate
</HEADLINE>
persist &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech President Vaclav Havel was
in stable condition Wednesday but doctors worried about lingering
pneumonia and an irregular heart rate.
	   Havel's heart rate soared to 200 beats per minute Tuesday and he
fell into critical condition for two hours because of blood
poisoning caused by pneumonia. Doctors stabilized his condition
with electric shocks.
	   ``Pneumonia has not yet been suppressed,'' Havel's doctor, Ilja
Kotik, told the CTK news agency Wednesday, adding that the
president's temperature lingered at about 38 degrees Celsius (100
degrees Fahrenheit).
	   ``Irregularities of the heart rhythm appear every now and then
but they are not dramatic and are caused by pneumonia,'' Kotik
said.
	   The 61-year-old president suffered a ruptured colon in April
while vacationing in the Austrian Alps. He underwent emergency
surgery and a colostomy was performed.
	   On July 26, a combined Austrian-Czech team of doctors closed the
colostomy in Prague. On Monday, Havel developed pneumonia related
to the operation.
	   Kotik said doctors considered changing the type of antibiotics
administered to Havel to suppress his body temperature.
	   Havel, a former chain-smoker and veteran of communist jails, has
suffered from chronic bronchitis for years.
	   A playwright and former dissident, Havel has been hospitalized
five times since December 1996, when a third of his lung and a
cancerous tumor were removed.
	   The Czech presidency is a largely ceremonial position, so while
Havel is hospitalized there is no need for his powers to be
transferred to someone else.
	   Should he be unable to return to office, parliament would
nominate a new president.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Strongman Hun Sen's ruling party
emerged the winner when long-delayed results from last week's
parliamentary election in Cambodia were announced Wednesday.
	   The results appeared to be enough to give his Cambodian People's
Party a majority in the new National Assembly, although an official
breakdown of seats was not announced.
	   The ruling party won 41.4 percent of the popular vote, with
2,030,802 votes from 4,902,488 valid ballots cast, according to
figures released by the National Election Committee.
	   Its victory had been anticipated on the basis of partial results
announced over the past week, and the release of complete
preliminary totals Wednesday did nothing to allay opposition
protests over alleged election fraud.
	   ``It has been and continues to be the stance of FUNCINPEC that
until the recounting is completed we cannot accept proclamation of
the results, and that's final,'' said Mu Sochua, a spokesman for
the FUNCINPEC party.
	   In the election committee's count, Prince Norodom Ranariddh's
FUNCINPEC party, the top opposition group, took 31.7 percent of the
popular vote, and its ally, the Sam Rainsy Party, 14.3 percent. The
remainder of the votes were divided among 36 smaller parties, none
of which appeared to have enough to win a seat in parliament.
	   The opposition groups have made repeated allegations that the
voting and ballot-counting were marred by irregularities and fraud.
	   They have called on the election committee to recount ballots in
suspect areas and have threatened to boycott the new parliamentary
session if their concerns are not met. Without the opposition's
attendance, the assembly is unlikely to have present the two-thirds
of its 122 members needed to conduct any major business.
	   Officials were painstakingly recounting votes from five communes
Wednesday, but it was not clear how many of the country's 1,700
communes would have their votes counted again in response to
protests. A handful of opposition politicians said Wednesday they
wanted a total recount.
	   ``They have the right to request the recount of all ballots, but
for this we need a lot of time, money, and people,'' said election
committee spokesman Samraing Kamsan, adding that he doubted the
request would get very far.
	   The committee, widely seen as being stacked in favor of Hun
Sen's ruling party, has come under mounting criticism for taking a
passive approach to complaints of irregularities.
	   It abruptly canceled its daily news briefing Wednesday, delaying
the announcement of election results by several hours.
	   NEC chairman Chheng Phon said in a written statement that
briefings were being terminated because of an impromptu news
conference held by opposition politicians Tuesday at the
committee's media center. Their actions endangered the committee's
spirit of neutrality, he said.
	   The action came after increasingly sharp questioning from the
press over a number of controversies, including its formula for
allocating parliamentary seats to the election winners.
	   Only last week did it become generally known that its draft
formula for the calculations had been slightly amended sometime
before the election to favor the party winning the most seats in
any given district.
	   In practice, this favors Hun Sen's party, providing it with an
estimated extra five seats, enough to attain a parliamentary
majority.
	   It also became known late Tuesday that the committee's vice
chairman, Kassie Neou, had asked to resign as head of the
subcommittee handling recounts.
	   Kassie Neou, a respected human rights worker considered one of
the few independent voices on the committee, said he was frustrated
by administrative and management problems, NEC spokesman Samraing
Kamsan said.
	   The election was held one year after Hun Sen ousted FUNCINPEC
leader Ranariddh as his co-premier in a violent coup, shattering a
tense dual premiership formed after the U.N.-sponsored elections in
1993.
	   Hun Sen hoped the polls would win back his legitimacy in the
international arena and aid lost after his power grab.

Talks move into second day under strict news blackout

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Another round of talks between the
Sudanese government and southern rebels aimed at ending a 15-year
civil war entered a second day Wednesday under a press blackout
imposed by chairman, Kenyan Foreign Minister Boyana Godana.
	   The talks, held under the auspices of the regional
Inter-Governmental Authority on Development, are expected to end
Thursday.
	   On Tuesday, participants agreed to a three-point agenda that
included discussion of the limits of southern Sudan, the role of
the Muslim religion in the region's future and administrative
details connected with an internationally supervised referendum on
self-determination in the southern portion of Africa's largest
nation.
	   Government and rebels from the Sudan People's Liberation Army,
whose 15-year civil war has ravaged Sudan and created a famine that
is claiming hundreds of lives a day, are at odds over the
delimitation of the area in which people will vote whether they
favor self-determination and greater autonomy from the Khartoum
government.
	   In the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, a U.S. official who has just
returned from the famine-stricken area, said Wednesday that
although more food is being delivered to the area, the situation is
not improving.
	   ``Explanations? An immediate one offered is diversion. On that
there is little doubt that not all of the food gets to where we
feel it should,'' said Roy Williams, director of foreign disaster
assistance fo the U.S. Agency for International Development.
	   There have been claims that the SPLA is taking part of the
relief food to feed its troops.
	   Williams said part of the problem is that the most vulnerable
are not being reached, partly because of limited air capacity.
	   He said USAID hopes to resolve that problem by renting two C-130
cargo planes for three months to carry relief food into southern
Sudan.
	   The SPLA has been fighting government troops since 1983 for
greater autonomy for the largely African, Christian and animist
south from the Islamic, Arabized north.
	   More than 1.5 milion people have died due to the fighting and
resultant famines.
	   The SPLA wants to include Southern Kordofan and Southern Blue
Nile provinces, as well as the eastern Nuba Mountains, within the
boundaries of southern Sudan.
	   The two provinces were included in northern Sudan at the time of
independence from British-Egyptian rule in 1956.
	   Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Ismail and Riak Machar, a
former SPLA commander who recently joined the government side, are
heading Khartoum's delegation to the talks.
	   SPLA commander Salva Kir heads the rebel delegation.
	   Last month, both sides declared a three-month cease-fire in
southwestern Bahr al-Ghazal province to facilitate delivery of
relief food. On Monday, Sudan expanded the area of its cease-fire,
but the SPLA called it a publicity maneuver prior to the opening of
the talks.

Rwandan army says it killed 60 rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The Rwandan army killed 60 Hutu rebels,
including a top leader, state-run radio reported Wednesday.
	   The body of rebel leader Lt. Col. Mugemanyi was put on display
Tuesday in Nyarutovu, 50 kilometers (32 miles) northwest of Kigali.
	   Another 59 rebels were killed along with their leader in clashes
Monday night, Rwandan radio said Wednesday in a broadcast monitored
in Nairobi.
	   Mugemanyi, whose name was spelled differently in earlier
reports, was described as a top commander of the Hutu insurgency.
	   Extremists in the former Hutu government slaughtered more than
500,000 mostly minority Tutsis before Tutsi rebels ended the 90-day
genocide and took power in July 1994.
	   Members of the defeated Hutu government and military, many of
whom were involved in the genocide, have since carried out attacks
inside Rwanda.

Yasser Arafat presented his new Cabinet to lawmakers on Wednesday,

U.N. weapons chief says Iraq stalemate isn't a crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Iraq &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler said
Wednesday that he did not view the collapse of disarmament talks
with Iraq as ``a crisis.''
	   Butler said Iraq's demand that he inform the U.N. Security
Council that Baghdad no longer has any weapons of mass destruction
was ``puzzling'' because of Iraq's progress toward disarmament in
several areas.
	   During a brief stopover in London en route to New York, Butler
played down talk of a crisis. He said he plans to meet U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan at the United Nations on Wednesday
afternoon and report to the Security Council on Thursday morning
``and see where we go.''
	   When he spoke to Annan Monday night from Baghdad after the talks
collapsed, ``I said very specifically to him that I don't think any
of us should describe this as a crisis,'' Butler told BBC Radio 4.
	   Butler cut short his visit to Baghdad after talks with Iraq's
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, who demanded a clean bill of
health on Baghdad's weapons programs. Until Butler's U.N. Special
Commission certifies that Iraq's arsenal of weapons of mass
destruction has been destroyed, the Security Council cannot lift
sanctions against Iraq.
	   Recalling his meeting, Butler said Aziz told him: ``You must go
and tell the Council the truth _ that is that we no longer have any
weapons of mass destruction.''
	   ``I said `I can't do that because, you see I don't have a magic
wand. I can't do disarmament by declaration. I have to have
evidence for any such claim, and sadly there's insufficient
evidence to justify your claim that you don't have any more weapons
or capability to make them,''' Butler said.
	   ``I appealed to him to give us those last bits of evidence that
we need. He declined to do so.''
	   Butler said he found Aziz's stance puzzling because the
commission is close to saying Iraq has no weapons of mass
destruction in some areas.
	   ``In the missile area, we're very close. In the chemical weapons
area, we're very close. We're not close in the biological weapons
area. And that's what was most puzzling to me _ that he should
insist on this ... claim that everything is done, because he knows
very well that that's far from true in the biological area,''
Butler said.
	   In the area of biological weapons, he said, ``Iraq has never
told us anything like the truth about its basic program.''
	   Butler said he agrees with those who say that the best way to
deal with the Iraqis is to give them a glimmer of hope that
sanctions will be lifted.
	   ``When people feel they're boxed in, as obviously the Iraqis do,
it's intelligent to offer them a light at the end of the tunnel, a
way out,'' he said.
	   ``On the other hand ... they have prolonged this matter for
seven years,'' Butler said. ``They always had the key in their
hands to an exit from sanctions and that key was disarmament, to
tell us the truth, lead us to the weapons, let us dispose of
them.''
	   ``But curiously, they've prolonged this agony, this process, by
never quite telling us the whole story.''

	   ITZHAR, West Bank (AP) _ The shooting deaths of two Israeli
settlers as they patrolled their settlement on Wednesday prompted
right-wing calls for a suspension of talks with Palestinians.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu planned to discuss the
shootings with his 12-member security Cabinet later Wednesday amid
calls that he freeze negotiations until Palestinians hand over the
attackers.
	   Israeli radio reports said Netanyahu had promised settlers to
expand Itzhar, the settlement where the shootings occurred. The few
hundred residents of the settlement, built on an isolated West Bank
hilltop surrounded by Palestinian villages, are known for their
ideological extremism.
	   Aviv Bushinsky, spokesman for Netanyahu, said the prime minister
takes a ``very grave view'' of the attack that killed two Jewish
seminary students.
	   ``He said that this proves the necessity of protecting the
security interests of the settlers in the negotiations with the
Palestinians,'' Bushinsky said.
	   Nabil Amr, an adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
member of the elected legislative council, said the attack
underlined the need for ``serious ideas'' from Israel to move the
peace process forward.
	   ``If Israel continues to waste time then that means we are
leaving the field open for others to do everything they want to end
the whole process, just like what happened last night,'' he said on
Israel Radio's Arabic service.
	   Following the shootings, Israel placed a curfew on five
surrounding Palestinian villages and closed roads leading to the
large Palestinian-run city of Nablus as troops searched the area
for the shooters.
	   Negotiations have been stalled for months over a U.S. proposal
for Israel to withdraw from an additional 13 percent of the West
Bank, a move that would leave many settlements as islands inside
Palestinian-controlled zones.
	   Netanyahu, under pressure from the strong Jewish settler lobby
and right-wing members of his Cabinet, has insisted on changes in
the American plan, including more stringent counter-terrorism
measures by Palestinians.
	   Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel said two of those
measures were control of roads used by settlers and confiscation of
illegal weapons from Palestinian militants. ``The murder of these
two Israelis is directly connected to these two issues,'' he said.
	   Palestinian legislator Ziad Abu Zayyad noted, however, that the
shootings occurred on land that is still under full Israeli control
and said Israel has failed to stop the smuggling of weapons from
Israel to the West Bank.
	   Abu Zayyad also said Netanyahu's government was responsible for
the killings because it ``caused the failure of the peace
process.''
	   ``As long as Israeli settlers are living inside the Palestinian
territories and among the Palestinian population, these things will
happen,'' he said.
	   In his latest offer, Netanyahu proposed withdrawing from 10
percent of the territory and turning an additional 3 percent into a
nature reserve where Israel's army would retain overall security.
But Arafat rejected the Israeli proposal on Tuesday.
	   Jewish settler leaders said even a 10 percent withdrawal would
have left Itzhar cut off and surrounded by Palestinian-controlled
territory. They said Wednesday's killings were a harbinger of
things to come if the pullback goes through.
	   ``This is a tragic example of what is likely to occur ten-fold
when troop redeployments are carried out. Itzhar and 18 other
settlements will be turned into isolated islands,'' said settler
council leader Ahron Dombe. He called on Netanyahu to cancel talks
until the assailants were found.
	   Michael Kleiner, a supporter of the settlers in the Israeli
Knesset, called for convening the 120-member parliament, which is
now in summer recess, and debating a proposal to stop talks with
the Palestinians until Arafat's government hands over the attackers
to Israel. He also demanded Israel not go through with a reported
plan to free 100 Palestinian prisoners.
	   Killed in the attack were Harel Binoun, 18, and Shlomo Livman,
24, both sons of prominent rabbis and students at the Joseph's tomb
seminary in the heart of Nablus _ a focal point of past
confrontations between Palestinians and Jewish settlers.
	   Moshe Yaalon, the army's West Bank commander, said the two
Israelis were patrolling in a pickup truck outside the settlement
about midnight when they were shot by two attackers laying in
ambush.
	   The truck was riddled with bullets, and Israel army radio said
the attackers repeatedly fired into the bodies of the Israelis to
make sure they were dead.

Russian tax collection improves, but still below targets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Improved tax receipts for July show that Russia is
making progress in getting its budget in order under an austerity
program, Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said in an interview
published Wednesday.
	   Also, the government has not had to spend any of a dlrs 4.8
billion it recently received from the International Monetary Fund,
using the money instead to bolster the Central Bank's reserves,
Kiriyenko told the Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper.
	   The loan, part of a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package to be
released gradually as Russia cleans up its finances, helped avoid a
devaluation of the ruble, Kiriyenko said, according to the Interfax
news agency.
	   ``The country was nearing the edge. We have made a step back but
have not run far away from the precipice,'' he added.
	   Russia's tax collection figures are up, but receipts in August
will be lower than expected, partly because the Communist-dominated
parliament rejected some government plans for new tax laws before
breaking for summer vacation.
	   The sluggish tax reform progress may be a factor when the IMF
decides whether to release the next part of the loan next month.
International lenders are intent on keeping up pressure on the
government to follow through with its promises, which have often
been allowed to melt away in the past.
	   Tax receipts for August are expected to total 12.5 billion
rubles (dlrs 2 billion), up marginally from July but still short of
a 14.8 billion ruble (dlrs 2.3 billion) target, Interfax reported.
	   Meanwhile, Russia's stock market was down 3.3 percent at midday
Wednesday, mostly in response to the New York Stock Exchange's 300
point fall the day before.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish troops killed 165 Kurdish rebels
in a week-long offensive in three southeastern provinces, officials
said Wednesday.
	   The governor's office for the southeastern region said 13
Turkish soldiers were also killed in the fighting that began on
July 31 in the provinces of Sirnak, Hakkari and Van.
	   The statement follows newspaper reports Wednesday that Kurdish
guerrillas attacked soldiers in the remote southeastern mountains
on the Iraqi border, killing 15 and injuring 25.
	   The guerrillas, members of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK,
also kidnapped 10 soldiers after the attack on Mount Kato along the
border with Iraq, the daily Cumhuriyet said.
	   Military officials could not be reached for comment.
	   The soldiers were stationed on Mount Kato to block guerrilla
escape routes into northern Iraq. The mountain, in the province of
Sirnak, which is about 1,200 kilometers (720 miles) southeast of
Ankara, is known as one of the strongholds of the estimated 1,500
Kurdish rebels operating inside Turkey.
	   Some 37,000 people have died in the PKK's fight for autonomy in
southeastern Turkey since 1984.

Severed leg of former premier to be returned home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The amputated leg of a turn-of-the-century Japanese
prime minister and university founder will be returned home after
being preserved for more than a hundred years in a jar of
formaldehyde at a Tokyo hospital, officials said Wednesday.
	   While foreign minister in 1889, Shignobu Okuma was seriously
injured when a right-wing activist threw a bomb into his carriage
outside the Foreign Ministry. His right leg was amputated below the
thigh.
	   Officials at what is now the Japan Red Cross Nursing University
Hospital kept the illustrious limb in its specimens room. But
because of redecorating work recently, it had to be moved to
prestigious Waseda University, which Okuma founded in 1882, said
hospital spokesman Akira Noguchi.
	   After Waseda said it couldn't find a suitable place to store the
leg, officials of Okuma's home town of Saga, 923 kilometers (577
miles) southwest of Tokyo, expressed interest in taking it, Noguchi
said.
	   The leg is likely to end up in the Okuma family temple of
Ryutaiji. The Okuma museum in Saga has expressed interest in the
limb's ``historical value.''
	   Okuma served as prime minister in 1898 and between 1914 and
1916.
	   He is remembered as an early Japanese champion of democratic
principles.
	   ``That leg's tougher than I thought,'' the former premier's
granddaughter, Risa Okuma, was quoted as saying by Kyodo News.

Nobel laureates urge Myanmar to hold dialogue with Aung San Suu

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Myanmar's military leadership should
open a dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi and restore all democratic
freedoms, six Nobel Prize laureates say.
	   Their statement was released Tuesday by the Stockholm-based
International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance. Suu
Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner, is a member of the
organization's board.
	   The statement was signed by peace prize laureates Jose
Ramos-Horta, Oscar Arias Sanchez, Desmond Tutu and Lech Walesa; and
literature winners Derek Walcott and Nadine Gordimer.
	   The government of Myanmar, also known as Burma, has held the
democracy activist under house arrest, or closely confined her
activities, since 1990. Last week, she was detained while trying to
leave the capital and a six-day roadside standoff ensued before she
was returned to the capital, Yangon.
	   ``We ... are heartened by the rising tide of popular support for
democratization in Southeast Asia and encouraged by the readiness
of a number of governments to respond and engage with civil
society. ... Burma is a tragic exception,'' the laureates'
statement said.

Acid test for series honors at Headingley
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LEEDS, England (AP) _ The battleground and the combatants are
predetermined but the result is no foregone conclusion.
	   For the England and South Africa cricket teams, a much-needed
series victory is at stake as they battle for the honors in the
fifth and final cricket test at Headingley starting Thursday.
	   England, on a high after its series levelling eight-wicket win,
is eyeing its first five-test series win since 1986-87.
	   For South Africa, a series win in England would be its most
prized accomplishment since returning to international cricket.
	   ``It will be important for us to go away from England with a
series win. It's a very big series for us. The first prize is to
win the tests,'' South African captain Hansie Cronje said
Wednesday.
	   South Africa is yet to win a major series since being readmitted
to test fold in 1992. The Proteas did look the dominant team in
this series before surrendering a 1-0 upper hand after losing the
fourth test by eight wickets at Trent Bridge.
	   The visitors won the second test at Lord's by 10 wickets, and
narrowly missed out on a another win at Old Trafford when England's
last pair thwarted them.
	   ``Every Test is massive even if you are 3-0 up,'' Cronje said.
``It's all to play for in this one. And we don't mind that
situation at all.''
	   South Africa, is considering its options for the crucial match _
whether to play five seamers. It might end up being a toss up
between two veterans, off-spinner Pat Symcox or all-rounder Brian
McMillan.
	   Another possible change could be McMillan for Gehardus
Liebenberg to open the batting with Gary Kirsten, which would
enable the Proteas to play Symcox at the expense of medium paceman
Steve Elworthy.
	   Headingley, traditionally is a seamer-friendly surface, hasn't
been a happy hunting ground for England. It has only won two tests
at the ground in the last 10 years, while losing six times in the
same period.
	   The last decade has not been a good win for English cricket in
terms of winning.
	   England has failed to win a series over a major test nation
since Mike Gatting's team won the Ashes 2-1 in Australia in
1986-87.
	   Since that Ashes victory, England has played both Australia and
the West Indies in four series and Pakistan and South Africa twice
each.
	   England has not won a five-test series on home soil since
beating Allan Border's Australia 3-1 in 1985.
	   If Alec Stewart's side can pull off a win at Headingley, it will
be the first time an England side has come from behind to win a
series since David Gower's side won 2-1 in India in 1984-85.
	   England has retained an unchanged 12 and it is most likely that
left-arm seamer Alan Mullally will form part of a four-pronged pace
attack.
	   The last time England fielded an all pace attack, it was
trounced by an innings and 148 runs by Australia in 1993.
	   So, if the home side decides to go ahead with leg spinner Ian
Salisbury, the bowler to miss out could be Dominic Cork, who has
played in the first four tests.
	   Mark Ramprakash calmed England's fitness fears, as he came out
unscathed after two net sessions.
	   The right hander, who missed Middlesex's tour match against Sri
Lanka, has suffered from tonsillitis since just before the last
test at Trent Bridge.
	   But he shrugged off his discomfort to top score in England's
first innings with an unbeaten 67.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Local sponsors for next month's
Commonwealth Games are still having trouble selling tickets,
especially for the opening ceremony and track and field events, a
sports official said Wednesday.
	   Of about 57,000 tickets for the Sept. 11 opening ceremony,
28,000 were still unsold, said the Games Committee's chief
operating officer, Abdul Manap Ibrahim. Thirty thousand seats for
the opening had been reserved for athletes, guests and officials.
	   ``I feel the number of unsold tickets for the opening ceremony
is not that much. What is of concern to us is the sale of tickets
for athletics,'' he was quoted as saying by the national news
agency, Bernama. Track and field is scheduled Sept. 16-21.
	   Britain and 69 other countries that once formed the British
empire are participating in the 10-day games.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A Jehovah's Witness teacher was hardworking, a
team player, admired by his colleagues and good at his job, but was
fired after 10 years for refusing to salute the flag and sing the
national anthem, his supervisors testified Wednesday in a civil
trial.
	   Peter Nappalli, 37, alleges he was fired in 1994 only because of
his religion, and is seeking reinstatement, back pay, a cleared
record and damages in a suit against the Institute of Technical
Education, a statutory body.
	   Testimony ended Wednesday after three days, and Judge Tan lee
Meng asked for written final arguments to be submitted over the
next 16 days.
	   ``We accept the fact that Mr. Nappalli has performed his
teaching duties well,'' defense attorney Tang Khin Wei told the
court, after Nappalli's lawyer had elicited a string of compliments
from opposing witnesses about the teacher's work record.
	   Even so, Tan Wee Kiet, an institute officer who recruits
teachers, said that because Nappalli would not recite the national
pledge or sing the anthem, ``it is very difficult for (him) to
function in the system. These are fundamental activities of the
school system.''
	   There is no state law that Singaporeans must recite the national
pledge and sing the anthem. But government-linked bodies such as
the vocational institute, schools and the military have such
requirements to promote patriotism in the tiny city-state of 3.1
million.
	   Despite a constitutional guarantee of freedom for individuals to
profess, practice and propagate their faith, laws in Singapore
restrict those rights. For example, the Jehovah's Witness
denomination has been banned since 1972 from meeting as a group,
owning land for a sanctuary, buying or selling. Individuals have
been prosecuted under criminal law for possessing the Jehovah's
Witness version of the Bible.
	   Tan, one of the officers who interviewed Nappalli when he joined
the institute in 1984, said he did not recall whether the Jehovah's
Witness had specified that he could not participate in the national
rituals. He acknowledged that firm guidelines requiring faculty to
participate had only been issued in 1988, after Nappalli had been
standing silently during school assemblies for four years.
	   Nappalli was first reported to headquarters in 1988 by school
manager Kok Kam Wah, who acknowledged he had not cited other
teachers who had committed similar infractions.
	   It is legal for individuals to be Jehovah's Witnesses, but they
often run into trouble when they obey the tenets of their faith by
refusing to perform military service, to sing the national anthem
or recite the national pledge. They believe the Bible prohibits
those things.
	   In his testimony, Kok said that while he was waiting for a
response from headquarters, he counseled Nappalli to shift his
position, although he knew it was based on religious conviction.
	   ``Although the plaintiff was firm in his beliefs, there was hope
that he could change over,'' said Kok. ``He was a good teacher. I
didn't want to lose a good teacher. My belief is that a person can
change for his good.''
	   Nappalli now works as a tutor to support his family. Like other
young Jehovah's Witnesses in Singapore, he spent three years in a
prison camp for refusing to perform military duties as part of the
compulsory national service.
	   Jehovah's Witnesses estimate there are 1,400 to 1,600 adherents
in Singapore, while government estimates have ranged up to 2,000.

Arafat presents new cabinet, most ministers keep jobs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to RECAST, UPDATE with more details on new
Cabinet, quotes from Arafat's speech &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat presented his new Cabinet to legislators on
Wednesday, and pledged ``accountability and transparency'' in all
government institutions.
	   The Palestinian Legislative Council has been demanding a Cabinet
reshuffle since publishing a report on widespread corruption in the
Palestinian Authority more than a year ago.
	   However, none of the ministers named in the corruption report
lost their jobs in the shakeup, raising doubts about Arafat's
commitment to reform.
	   ``The platform of this government is to continue building
Palestinian institutions and to reinforce law and order and the
foundations of an independent judiciary, human rights, pluralism,
accountability and transparancy in all institutions of the
Palestinian Authority,'' Arafat said in a speech to the council in
the West Bank town of Ramallah.
	   Several legislators said they were dissatisfied with the new
Cabinet and would not vote to approve it.
	   ``This new formulation ... does not fulfill the demands of the
council,'' said Husam Khader, a legislator from the West Bank town
of Nablus.
	   ``The old Cabinet remained and the changes made are insufficient
to improve the situation or fulfill the conditions that we set.''
	   Civil Affairs Minister Jamil Tarifi, who retained his post
despite being heavily cited in the corruption report, said he was
``very satisfied'' with Arafat's decision. ``I understand that we
have a lot of hard work to do,'' he said.
	   Arafat read a list of names before the council after giving a
speech on the political sitution. All but one of the 10 new faces
were legislators, and all but one belong to Arafat's ruling party,
Fatah.
	   Arafat retained control of the interior ministry, which controls
the Palestinian security forces. He took over the Education
Ministry after relieving the aging Yasser Amro of his duties.
	   Arafat announced three new ministries: environment,
parliamentary affairs, and prisoner affairs. The official
Palestinian Authority newspaper, Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, said a
ministry of Israeli settlement affairs would also be established,
headed by legislator Salah Tamari.
	   Jerusalem legislator Ziad Abu Zayyad was named a minister, in a
direct blow to the main PLO official in Jerusalem, Faisal Husseini.
Abu Zayyad's portfolio was not announced.
	   ``There is constant improvement in all of the Palestinian
Authority ministries and institutions,'' Arafat told the council.
``There is more awareness of law and order and the interests of the
people and the homeland.''
	   The council did not immediately set a date to vote on the new
Cabinet.

Albanian junior soccer team requests asylum in Finland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ An Albanian junior soccer team that
participated in the Helsinki Cup youth tournament in July has
requested asylum in Finland, the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper
reported Wednesday.
	   The newspaper said the 23-member team has stayed in Finland
since the July tournament. Immigration officials decline to comment
on the report to The Associated Press.
	   According to the newspaper, the players' parents remain in
Albania, but would be eligible to immigrate if their children are
granted asylum.
	   Although the asylum request was filed for the entire team, only
individual applications are acceptable, the newspaper quoted
immigration official Anita Honkanen as saying.

Eight Indonesian soldiers suspected in shooting of Irian Jaya
</HEADLINE>
student &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Eight soldiers are under investigation
in the fatal shooting of a university student in a pro-independence
protest last month in a remote Indonesian province, the official
Antara news agency reported Wednesday.
	   Witness testimony and other evidence indicate that 22-year-old
Steven Suripaty was shot by officers riding in a military vehicle,
military investigators said.
	   A female high school student was also shot and injured during
the campus protest July 3 in Jayapura, the capital of Irian Jaya.
Several demonstrations by separatist activists in the province last
month turned violent.
	   Investigations of the military are also under way in Jakarta,
where a son-in-law of former President Suharto, Lt. Gen. Prabowo
Subianto, faces questioning in the kidnapping of political
activists. A dozen lower-ranking officers are also under
investigation.
	   In another probe, 18 police are suspected in the May shootings
of four anti-government student demonstrators.
	   Antara quoted Col. Hendra Giri, head of a military fact-finding
team in Irian Jaya, as saying Suripaty was hit by at least one
bullet from an M-16 or Kalashnikov rifle. Eight soldiers in the
vehicle were carrying those weapons and had live ammunition.
	   Suripaty died after being in a coma for 16 days.
	   At least four students have been questioned in the death of a
policeman who was beaten during the same protest.
	   Indonesia took control of Irian Jaya from Dutch colonizers in
1963. Six years later, voters in a U.N.-supervised ballot chose
incorporation with Indonesia, itself a former Dutch colony.
	   Since then, a small band of guerrillas has skirmished
periodically with the military. Demands for independence have grown
since the resignation in May of authoritarian Suharto.

No end in sight to Turkish strike at U.S. military facilities

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A strike by some 1,400 Turkish employees
working for U.S. military facilities entered its 14th day Wednesday
with organizers vowing to fight on.
	   The strike has disrupted life at bases in Ankara, Izmir as well
as at Incirlik air base, near the southern city of Adana, home to
2,000 service members and center for a major air operation over
Iraq. The action has shut down the commissary, gas station, dining
halls and other facilities.
	   ``We are determined to keep up our struggle until the end,''
said Ibrahim Yalcin, deputy head of Harb-Is, the Union of Defense
Industry and Allied Workers that organized the strike. ``Whichever
side has the superior power to resist, will win.''
	   The strikers are demanding better pay and fringe benefits.
	   Yalcin accused the U.S. Air Force of breaking Turkish laws by
getting servicemen to take on duties normally done by the strikers,
including repair work and garbage collecting.
	   ``The strikers have been trying to stop them and that has been
the main cause of tensions,'' he said.
	   The sides are awaiting a judge's ruling to settle a dispute over
which facilities can operate, said Capt. Max Torrens, spokeswoman
for the base.
	   An airman and a striker were briefly detained in the first week
of the strike after altercations over the use of a facility. They
were released when a prosecutor said the case was not worth
pursuing.
	   The air base was forced to lift a travel restriction to Incirlik
village and Adana to allow service members to resupply off-base
after the shut down of all shopping and feeding facilities.
	   Last Saturday a U.S. airman, Robert Rodriguez, was assaulted in
the parking lot of a supermarket in Adana.
	   According to his account reported by the base spokeswoman, he
was attacked from behind, thrown to the ground, kicked and punched
by at least four persons while unlocking his vehicle. His wife,
3-year-old daughter and a friend were with him, said Torrens.
	   The assailants ran away when crowds began to form outside the
supermarket. Rodriguez sustained non-life threatening injuries.
	   Police said they did not know the motive. The labor union said
the attack had nothing to do with the strikers.
	   Incirlik, some 10 kilometers (6 miles) northeast of Adana, is
home to ``Operation Northern Watch,'' which patrols the no-fly zone
north of the 36th parallel in northern Iraq. More than 45 U.S. and
British planes monitor Iraq's treatment of the Kurds in the zone.
	   The strikers are demanding that salaries be raised every three
months in line with inflation, now running around 70 percent, as
well as compensation for earlier pay cuts, the union's Yalcin said.
	   He said the workers have been offered a one-time payment of 80
million Turkish lira (dlrs 300), a 37 percent increase in the first
year followed by three monthly increases in line with inflation the
second year.

Singapore rebuts Malaysian allegations over checkpoint dispute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from Malaysia, last 4 grafs &QL; 
 &UR; By JONATHAN DRAKE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore has hit back at Malaysia, accusing
its northern neighbor of making unsubstantiated allegations in a
border dispute between the two Southeast Asian allies.
	   A Home Affairs Ministry spokesman on Tuesday denied five
assertions made by Malaysia since Singapore relocated its
immigration, customs and quarantine post Saturday against the
wishes of its larger neighbor, a government statement said.
	   Malaysia has condemned the move and kept its immigration
officers at the original Tanjong Pagar railway station bordering
Singapore's financial district in the south of the island, a move
Singapore has deemed unlawful and counterproductive.
	   The increasingly acrimonious argument has aggravated
progressively souring relations between the two nations.
Longstanding unresolved issues include land disputes and the sale
of Malaysian water, on which Singapore depends heavily.
	   But the nations are also partners in the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, a regional body that also includes Brunei,
Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.
	   In a blunt statement, the Home Affairs Ministry said
``unsubstantiated allegations from Malaysia, blaming everything on
Singapore, are nothing new.''
	   ``We can only conclude that those who make such allegations do
not know the facts or have chosen to disregard them,'' the
statement added.
	   Responding to claims that the relocation was sudden, unilateral
and deliberately timed when Malaysia was facing an economic crisis,
the spokesman reiterated that the intention to shift the checkpoint
was announced as early as 1989.
	   The spokesman also declared that allegations of Singapore's
arrogance and insensitivity over the issue are ``what Malaysia
usually says when it has no logical arguments to offer.''
	   He said Singapore has every right to locate its immigration
facilities at the border, while Malaysia's about-face on the issue
last year and its demand to remain at the old checkpoint were
themselves arrogant and insensitive.
	   The ministry described the accusation of a ploy to seize the
Malaysian-owned land where Tanjong Pagar is located as ``completely
unfounded,'' and argued that the dispute was a result of Malaysia
repeatedly changing its position on the issue.
	   Finally, the spokesman described as ``absurd'' Malaysian claims
that the Singapore media had an agenda to incite Singaporeans to
hate Malaysia.
	   He said Malaysian media generally had not reported on
Singapore's statements while the city-state's media had reported on
Malaysian statements.
	   The spokesman said that Malaysia has promised to provide within
three months its legal arguments to prove its right to remain at
the old checkpoint.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir asked
Singapore to be more considerate toward its larger northern
neighbor.
	   ``We are peace-loving but don't take us for granted,'' he said.
	   Sabbaruddin Chik, secretary-general of Malaysia's ruling United
Malays National Organization, added Wednesday that ``the whole
nation'' is backing Mahathir's warning to Singapore, the national
news agency Bernama reported.
	   Ruhanie Ahmad, a backbencher in Malaysia's Parliament, said
during a debate Tuesday that Singapore had gone ``overboard'' with
its rancorous criticism of Malaysia. He urged his government to
resist Singapore.

Iraqi Parliament speaker calls for ending cooperation with U.N.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new comments by Butler downplaying confrontation
and Iraqi Assembly recessing briefly; EDITS throughout to trim. &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's Parliament speaker urged President
Saddam Hussein on Wednesday to suspend all cooperation with U.N.
weapons inspectors if the eight-year-old U.N. sanctions against the
country are not lifted.
	   The statement by Sadoun Hammadi at a special session of the
National Assembly came amid a new argument with the weapons
inspectors in charge of determining whether Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction.
	   The Assembly, which routinely backs Saddam, was called into
session to consider an unspecified plan by the Iraqi leader to end
the sanctions, which were imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in
1990, sparking the Gulf War.
	   The sanctions, which block the country from freely exporting its
most valuable commodity, oil, cannot be lifted until U.N.
inspectors certify that Iraq has destroyed its chemical and
biological weapons and long-range missiles.
	   The legislators were expected to approve Saddam's plan, whose
details have not been revealed. The plan was first reported Tuesday
by the Iraqi News Agency after U.N. chief weapons inspector Richard
Butler cut short a visit to Baghdad, saying Iraq was refusing to
continue disarmament talks.
	   Hammadi, in his speech, referred to a resolution adopted in
November by the 250-member Assembly, which called for a complete
halt to cooperation with the weapons inspection program if the
sanctions were not lifted in six months.
	   ``The solution lies in the application by the leadership of the
Assembly's resolution, '' Hammadi said. ``We see that the
resolution should have been implemented ... and now we call for the
implementation.''
	   The Assembly went into recess after hearing a stream of
criticism of the United States and Butler by Iraqi officials but
returned in the afternoon.
	   Iraq's latest stand threatens to bring to a halt the U.N.
Special Commission's program launched in 1991 to uncover Iraq's
illegal weapons, a mission often disrupted by confrontations
between Iraqi and U.N. officials.
	   But Butler sought to play down the seriousness of the latest
argument. In a stopover in London en route to New York, Butler said
he already had told U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan by telephone
that the troubles should not be exaggerated.
	   ``I said very specifically to him that I don't think any of us
should describe this as a crisis,'' he told BBC radio.
	   Butler, who is expected to brief the U.N. Security Council on
Thursday, also said in an interview published Wednesday in the
Bahrain Tribune that the disarmament talks did not collapse. ``They
came to an early end,'' he said.
	   In London, Butler said he did not understand why Iraq's Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz cut short a meeting Monday since he told
Aziz the inspectors were ``very close'' to certifying Iraq had
destroyed its missiles and chemical weapons. Though he added they
were ``not close'' to solving the problem of biological weapons.
	   A day earlier, Butler said the latest impasse arose when Aziz
demanded that U.N. inspectors give Iraq a clean bill of health on
destruction of all its dangerous arms.
	   ``I told him that I cannot fulfill your demand because I don't
have the evidence,'' Butler said after flying into Bahrain en route
to New York. ``After I said that to him, Aziz replied, `Then we
can't talk any further.'''
	   Butler's political adviser, Gustavo Zlauvinen, said Aziz also
refused to accept a proposal to speed up the pace of weapons
inspections.
	   Criticism of Iraq by Britain and the United States also appeared
muted compared to past confrontations when the two countries
threatened military action.
	   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin
said Saddam had ``shot himself in the foot'' by mishandling a
chance to end economic sanctions. ``Iraq has only harmed itself,''
Rubin said.
	   Iraq's official newspapers stressed anew, meanwhile, that U.N.
weapons inspectors were cooperating in American plots against
Saddam's government by refusing to confirm that the country had
eliminated its weapons systems.
	   The daily Al-Thawra, the official paper of Saddam's ruling
party, ridiculed the idea that Iraq should be considered a threat
after the years of work by the inspectors.
	   ``After seven years of inspections, monitoring, obtaining
documents, destroying factories and ... searching presidential
sites, they say that Iraq is a threat,'' said the paper.

Gunmen rob Libyan diplomat in Somalia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Somali gunmen robbed a Libyan diplomat
of a vehicle and rifles carried by his bodyguards as the envoy
prepared to leave the country, sources said Wednesday.
	   The robbery occurred Tuesday at Ballidogle airport, about 90
kilometers (56 miles) south of Mogadishu, said the sources, who are
close to Hussein Mohamed Aidid's faction.
	   Aidid controls the Soviet-built airstrip and the area around it
as well as most of southern Mogadishu.
	   Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed, who controls northern part of the
city, are claiming to have formed a joint administration in the
war-torn capital.
	   There were no reports of casualties, and the unidentified Libyan
was allowed to leave the country, the sources said.
	   Aidid is known to be close to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who
is reported to have provided the Somali faction leader with
weapons.
	   Gadhafi has been pressing Somali faction leaders to establish a
joint administration and reopen air and sea ports in the city.
	   Officials from Adidid's headquarters and elders were sent to
Ballidogle Wednesday to attempt to recover the Libyan's vehicle and
weapons.
	   In Mogadishu, Ali Mahdi and Aidid met during the night with
their opponents, Osman Ali, commonly known as Atto, and Gen.
Mohamed Sheik Osman.
	   The talks were held behind closed doors and details were
unavailable. But sources say Osman and Atto are unhappy with Aidid
and Ali Mahdi's claims of a joint administration.
	   Somalia has had no central government since the 1991 ouster by
rebels of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre.
	   After Siad Barre's ouster, the rebels turned against each other
and the country broke up into fiefdoms carved out by clan-based
militias.

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ An Albanian junior soccer team that
participated in the Helsinki Cup youth tournament in July has
requested asylum in Finland, the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper
reported Wednesday.
	   The newspaper said the 23-member team has stayed in Finland
since the July tournament. Immigration officials decline to comment
on the report to The Associated Press.
	   According to the newspaper, the players' parents remain in
Albania, but would be eligible to immigrate if their children are
granted asylum.
	   An application filed for an entire team would go against Finnish
procedures because only individual applications are acceptable,
immigration official Anita Honkanen told Finnish national radio,
without confirming whether such an application had been filed.

	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II on Wednesday condemned the
killing of an activist priest in Haiti and asked for prayers in
support of the ``dear Haitian nation.''
	   The Rev. Jean Pierre-Louis, who was active in organizing Haiti's
peasants, was accosted by two gunmen as he got out of his car
Monday in Port-au-Prince. No arrests have been reported.
	   ``With deep pain, I would like to recall that another priest was
assassinated Monday,'' John Paul told his general audience. Last
week, he deplored the recent deaths of five missionaries.

Chernobyl firefighters concerned by heat wave in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A heat wave has firefighters worried about
the possibility of a blaze in the contaminated forests around the
Chernobyl power plant, site of the world's worst nuclear accident,
a newspaper said Wednesday.
	   A major fire in the area could spread radioactive particles that
fell on the region following the 1986 explosion and fire in
Chernobyl. The particles are heavily concentrated in the
surrounding forests.
	   So far this year, at least 44 fires have been registered in the
19-mile (30-kilometer) ``dead zone'' around the ill-fated plant,
said Volodymyr Tsybylya, chief firefighter of the regional forestry
department.
	   Most began in flat grassland and only a small forest area has
been destroyed, he told the daily Fakty.
	   However, firefighters have declared a general alert after the
heat wave raised temperatures to more than 30 Celsius (86
Fahrenheit), Fakty reported. It said patrol helicopters were making
four flights a day over forests in the area to check for fires.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asia's stock markets, some already dropping
toward levels they haven't seen in months or years, fell further
Wednesday because of Wall Street's big losses but found support
from what has become an unlikely source _ Japan.
	   The overnight drop of nearly 300 points in the Dow Jones
industrial average was the worst this year and added to concerns
about whether the bull run on Wall Street was reaching an end.
	   Wall Street's sudden drop was at least partly attributed to the
seemingly endless string of bad news from Asia. Back in Asia, it
added an international element to the regional worries about
Japan's new government, China's growth rate, poor corporate
earnings and recession.
	   Japan's inability to shake off years of economic drift and act
like the largest economy in Asia, and second-largest in the world,
has been a drag on the entire region as it tries to right itself
after a very bad year. However, on Wednesday, a stronger yen and
hopes that new Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi would finally turn
things around helped make another dismal day not quite so bad in
Tokyo.
	   In response to the losses on Wall Street, the yen rose in Tokyo
and the dollar fell to its lowest level in about a week. The Nikkei
recouped early losses and closed the day only 31.42 points down, or
0.2 percent, at 15,992.16.
	   Obuchi addresses Parliament on Friday. Tokyo's markets are
looking for signs that his government will move to reform the
finance industry and make good on promises to cut taxes.
	   Because of the influence of the Japanese economy in Asia,
developments in Tokyo often are among the major factors affecting
market movements.
	   Otherwise, there was very little to cheer about in Asia.
	   In Seoul, share prices plunged on the Dow Jones fall. The
benchmark KOSPI index fell 10.37 points, or 3.2 percent, closing at
322.83.
	   Analysts said weaker U.S. economic conditions would hurt Asian
exports to the United states and prolong Asia's _ and South Korea's
_ economic slowdown.
	   ``South Korean shares fell too much compared to other Asian
stocks,'' said Shin Dong-sung, an analyst at Samsung Securities Co.
	   Hong Kong's Hang Seng index, which plunged 4.8 percent Monday,
resumed its slide, closing more than 100 points, or 1.5 percent,
down at 7,466.43. The Hang Seng closed barely four points above
this year's low of 7,462.50, set June 15.
	   ``The market was led down by HSBC,'' said Richard Verin of
Credit Suisse First Boston.
	   HSBC Holdings announced late Monday that its net profit for
1998's first six months fell 16 percent from a year earlier.
	   The group's principal unit, Hong Kong Bank, posted a 41 percent
profit decline.
	   Elsewhere:
	   WELLINGTON: Shares finished lower, with brokers saying the local
market suffered from the heavy fall on Wall Street. The NZSE-40 was
down 36.74, or 1.77 percent, to 2,044.28.
	   SYDNEY: Australian shares closed lower in response to the Wall
Street plunge and sliding Asian markets. The All Ordinaries Index
fell 42.1, or 1.6 percent, to 2,640.2.
	   TAIPEI: Taiwan's main index closed at its lowest since June 17.
The Weighted Price Index fell 93.41 points, or 1.23 percent, to
7,499.73.
	   JAKARTA: Escalating political worries and regional bearishness
after the Dow Jones' overnight fall dragged Indonesian shares down
sharply. The Jakarta Stock Exchange composite index lost 19.566
points, or 4.2 percent, closing at 441.784.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Shares finished lower as the dispute between
Malaysia and Singapore over a railway-border checkpoint gave
investors more reason to avoid the stock market. The Composite
Index was down 6.15 points, or 1.6 percent, to 380.29.
	   BANGKOK: The main index closed at its lowest level in 11 years
despite a late rally in bank and finance shares. The central bank
announced that it would guarantee foreign investments in the
troubled sector. The SET index lost 3.97 points, or 1.5 percent, to
254.07.
	   SINGAPORE: Shares closed mostly lower following Wall Street's
overnight plunge, but a stable yen offset the impact and lightened
losses. The STI was down 12.86 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,052.13.
	   MANILA: Shares were mixed, with most blue chips on the rebound
and most other stocks ending weak on Wall Street's plunge. The PSE
Index was up 13.31 points to 1,524.75. On Tuesday, the index had
fallen to 1,511.44, its lowest level in five years.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ The delicate ethnic and military alliance
that catapulted Laurent Kabila to Congo's presidency is unraveling,
with rebellious fighters battling his troops at both ends of the
central African country. Gunfire has broken out in the eastern town
of Bukavu near the border with Rwanda, said local aid workers
Tuesday. A provincial official told The Associated Press that the
rebels were in control of the city, although some reports indicated
that fighting continued. Banyamulenge ethnic fighters and Rwandan
troops were leading the uprising against Kabila, accusing him of
widespread corruption and government mismanagement. Those groups
played a key role in helping Kabila march to victory last year over
longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. But Kabila now accuses
Rwanda _ whose vice president, Paul Kagame, was widely viewed as
helping him topple Mobutu _ of being behind the movement against
his leadership. Rwanda denies orchestrating the mutiny. (CONGO)
	   JIAYU, China _ Four days after a dike protecting it collapsed,
Jiayu County in central China's Hubei province struggles Wednesday
with the aftermath of some of the worst of an unusually destructive
season of summer flooding that has already killed at least 1,288
people. Already badly hit provinces in the south and east were
warned to brace for possible further flooding from tropical storm
Otto, which barreled into Fujian province on the southeast coast
Wednesday after killing at least one person in Taiwan. Officials
had warned that Otto's winds and heavy rains might cause
flood-weakened dikes to collapse, but weather officials said
Wednesday that Otto was losing strength as it headed inland. The
death toll from Saturday's floods in Jiayu caused by the sudden
levee collapse remained unclear Wednesday. County officials said
they were concentrating on rescuing and resettling the living, not
counting the dead or injured. A Hong Kong-based human rights group
claimed Tuesday that more than 1,000 people were believed missing.
(CHINA-FLOODS)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Strongman Hun Sen's ruling party
emerged the winner when long-delayed results from last week's
parliamentary election in Cambodia were announced Wednesday. The
results appeared to be enough to give his Cambodian People's Party
a majority in the new National Assembly, although an official
breakdown of seats was not announced. The ruling party won 41.4
percent of the popular vote, with 2,030,802 votes from 4,902,488
valid ballots cast, according to figures released by the National
Election Committee. The announcement of the results did nothing to
allay opposition protests over alleged election fraud. In the
election committee's count, Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC
party, the top opposition group, took 31.7 percent of the popular
vote, and its ally, the Sam Rainsy Party, 14.3 percent. The
remainder of the votes were divided among 36 smaller parties, none
of which appeared to have enough to win a seat in parliament.

	   ITZHAR, West Bank (AP) _ The shooting deaths of two Israeli
settlers Wednesday prompted right-wing calls for a suspension of
talks with Palestinians. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu planned
to discuss the shootings with his 12-member security Cabinet amid
calls that he freeze negotiations until Palestinians hand over the
attackers. Israeli radio reports said Netanyahu had promised
settlers to expand Itzhar, the settlement where the shootings
occurred. The few residents of the West Bank settlement are known
for their ideological extremism. Aviv Bushinsky, spokesman for
Netanyahu, said the prime minister takes a ``very grave view'' of
the attack and said it proves the need of protecting ``settlers in
the negotiations with the Palestinians.'' Nabil Amr, an adviser to
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and member of the elected
legislative council, said the attack underscored the need for
``serious ideas'' from Israel to move the peace process forward.
(ISRAEL-SHOOTING)
	   QIREZ, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Continued fighting between ethnic
Albanian refugees and Serbian forces has stymied plans to send an
international aid convoy to a devastated former rebel stronghold.
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees wanted to send aid to
Malisevo _ a former Kosovo Liberation Army stronghold that fell to
the Serbs in the current offensive. The International Committee of
the Red Cross has reached the valley near Qirez, but the continuing
hostilities has stalled the project. ``We cannot go into a
battlefield,'' refugee agency spokesman Kris Janowski said in
Geneva. He compared the situation in Kosovo to what happened in
1992 in Bosnia, when Bosnian Serb forces embarked on a policy of
trying to empty areas of their non-Serb populations. Serb police
have been barring or slowing aid groups and diplomatic observers
from reaching tens of thousands of refugees driven from villages in
the Yugoslav province, where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting
for independence. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The surprising sell-off on Wall Street has
rattled several of its most unwavering optimists, who have
expressed doubts about the bull market's staying power in recent
days. The most notable convert on Tuesday was Ralph Acampora, a
market analyst at Prudential Securities who previously gained
notoriety for his forecast that the Dow would hit 10,000 this year.
Acampora has now issued a ``bear call,'' predicting a sharper drop
for the big blue-chip companies like those in the Dow. Other
leading analysts, however, maintained a bullish stance, noting that
there's no sign of a recession in the economy. ``I'll differ with
some people who are saying we're in a bear market,'' said Bob
Dickey, managing director of technical analysis at Dain Rauscher in
Minneapolis, predicting the Dow will hit bottom at 8,100. ``The
economy is still in good shape and interest rates are low.'' Less
than three weeks after jumping to record highs, the U.S. stock
market is reeling from its worst beating since last October. The
Dow Jones industrial average fell 299.43 points on Tuesday to
finish at 8,487.31 in the second busiest day in history. (US-STOCK

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund has
agreed to let Thailand's government and state enterprises run
limited budget deficits in the next fiscal year as a means to
stimulate economic recovery, a government spokesman said Wednesday.
The Thai government announced this week it intends to run a budget
deficit equal to 3.5 percent of gross domestic product. IMF targets
had called for a 1 percent surplus, but that was before the depth
of the country's economic crisis became apparent. The IMF and
Thailand are working on ways to ease an economic contraction in a
quarterly review of the dlrs 17.2 billion economic rescue program
the IMF is supervising for the country, said Akhapol Sorasuchart,
the government spokesman. Various analysts have predicted the
economy will shrink by between 6 and 8 percent this year. Thailand
is expected to submit plans this month to ease unemployment, which
has been forecast to exceed 2 million this year. (THAILAND-IMF)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Improved tax receipts for July show that Russia is
making progress in getting its budget in order under an austerity
program, Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said in an interview
published Wednesday. Also, the government has not had to spend any
of a dlrs 4.8 billion it recently received from the International
Monetary Fund, using the money instead to bolster the Central
Bank's reserves, Kiriyenko told the Moskovsky Komsomolets
newspaper. The loan, part of a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package to
be released gradually as Russia cleans up its finances, helped
avoid a devaluation of the ruble, Kiriyenko said, according to the
Interfax news agency. ``The country was nearing the edge. We have
made a step back but have not run far away from the precipice,'' he
added. Russia's tax collection figures are up, but receipts in
August will be lower than expected. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Ending a 15-year dispute, a court ordered the
Japanese government and road authorities Wednesday to pay a total
of 149 million yen (dlrs 1.03 million) to 48 people who suffered
asthma and other illnesses caused by air pollution. The Yokohama
District Court ordered the state and the Metropolitan Express
Public Corp. to make the payment, a court official said, on
condition of anonymity. The state was held responsible as the
caretaker of major roads in the affected areas. The judge at the
court's Kawasaki branch said that the plaintiffs, who have lived
within 50 meters (164 feet) from major arteries in Kawasaki,
suffered asthma and other ailments caused by exhaust emitted from
automobiles. Wednesday's ruling came two years after a group of 14
Japanese companies in Kawasaki, a major industrial city adjoining
Tokyo, agreed to pay 3.1 billion yen (dlrs 21.5 million) to 438
people who complained of illness from air pollution.

	   DETROIT (AP) _ General Motors Corp. will eliminate up to 1,000
jobs and make other changes expected to save up to dlrs 300 million
a year in a major reorganization of its North American sales,
service and marketing operation. The reorganization will change the
way the automaker's field staff works with its 8,100 dealers by
creating regional sales, service and marketing teams to replace
duplicate teams at each of five GM vehicle divisions. Tuesday's
announcement comes one day after the world's largest automaker said
it plans to sell off its Delphi Automotive Systems parts subsidiary
by late next year. Ron Zarrella, GM vice president and marketing
chief, said said the hopes to reduce the number of models it offers
to about 70 models, down from about 80 today. (US-GM

Court to decide whether to rejail German suspect in police attack

<TEXT>
	   DOUAI, France (AP) _ A German citizen under investigation for
the attack on a French policeman after a World Cup match appeared
before a judge who is to rule later Wednesday whether to return the
suspect to jail.
	   Karl-Heinz Elschner is one of six suspects arrested in
connection with the June 21 attack on Daniel Nivel, 44, who spent
six weeks in a coma, gaining consciousness on Monday.
	   Elschner was placed under investigation for attempted homicide,
then freed June 29 after his lawyer successfully argued that
authorities may have misidentified his client.
	   In the succession of legal moves, the prosecutor's office then
appealed the decision to free Elschner.
	   According to attorney Eric Dupont Moretti, Elschner is the
victim of a misidentification. He argued that two witnesses to the
attack said the suspect they saw wore a pierced earring and had a
tattoo, while his client has neither.
	   Elschner was arrested shortly after the attack on Nivel by a
group of German fans shortly after the match between Germany and
Yugoslavia in the northern city of Lens.
	   Nivel was guarding a police vehicle near the stadium at the
time. He was hit on the back of the head with an iron bar.
	   Four suspects are in custody in Germany, facing charges of joint
attempted murder and causing serious bodily harm as well as
disturbing the peace. Another suspect is being held in France.

Prince Charles and the princes vacation in Greece
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Prince Charles and his two sons began the
first full day of their Greek vacation Wednesday nearly one year
after the late Princess Diana cruised the same waters.
	   Charles and Princes William and Harry arrived in Greece late
Tuesday as guests of two billionaire ship owners.
	   The royal visitors were expected to stay on Yiannis Latsis'
122-meter (402-foot) yacht Alexander, then embark on a cruise on
one of Panaghiotis Lemos' yachts.
	   Last August, Diana and her friend Rosa Monckton spent six days
cruising the Saronic Gulf south of Athens and visiting several
islands. Diana, her millionaire beau, Dodi Fayed, and their
chauffeur were killed Aug. 31, 1997, in a car crash in Paris.
	   The vacation plans for Charles and his sons were not disclosed.
	   The hosts, Latsis and Lemos, are known for protecting the
privacy of their high-profile guests.
	   In July, former U.S. President George Bush and retired U.S. Gen.
Colin Powell and their families arrived in Greece to cruise aboard
Latsis' yacht.

China to give high-tech firms a boost
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's securities regulators plan to give
high-tech companies preferential treatment for stock listing, an
official report said Wednesday.
	   The policy was announced by Zhou Zhengqing, head of the China
Securities Regulatory Commission, in a speech to officials of the
Shenzhen Stock Exchange that was reported by the China Securities
News and other financial papers Wednesday.
	   Zhou's comments were accompanied by announcements that two
government-backed high-tech companies _ Beijing Datang
Telecommunications and Technology and Shenzhen Neptunus
Bioengineering _ will launch new share offerings Friday.
	   The report did not specify what preferential policies would be
granted to companies specializing in advanced technology.
	   The securities commission is seeking to improve confidence in
new listings amid signs that with shares trading at prices nearly
40 times earnings, one of the highest valuations in Asia,
high-flying markets in Shenzhen and Shanghai may be due for a
correction.
	   Despite slowing profit growth and rising unemployment, investors
continued to pour funds into the markets for much of the first half
of the year. But enthusiasm has waned in the last two months, with
A-share indices, which track shares sold to domestic investors,
falling by about 15 percent in both Shanghai and Shenzhen. Trading
volumes, normally dlrs 1.5 billion a day, have also fallen sharply.
	   The slowdown is hindering government efforts to raise funds for
state enterprises. Only one state-run company was able to launch an
initial public offering in July, one of the slowest months for
domestic IPOs in nearly two years.
	   For China, the A-share markets are an increasingly important
part of the domestic economy. Since their launch in 1990, total
domestic stock market capitalization has grown to some dlrs 250
billion in 1998 from just dlrs 150 million, making China's A-share
markets the third largest in terms of capitalization in Asia now.
	   Beijing also considers the markets a key avenue to tap domestic
bank savings to support economic growth.

Chinese activists denounce Indonesia over attacks on ethnic
</HEADLINE>
Chinese &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Democracy campaigners accused Indonesia's
government Wednesday of complicity in mass rapes of ethnic Chinese,
and urged strong measures to pressure Jakarta into punishing the
guilty.
	   The rapes, committed during bloody riots in May, were ``among
the most serious and despicable acts of political terrorism this
century,'' said an open letter signed by 44 activists in China.
	   ``We cannot abide the violent acts of the Indonesian rioters,
much less can we abide the Indonesian government's acts of
appeasement and connivance,'' the letter said.
	   China's Foreign Ministry has called at least three times for
Indonesia to investigate the attacks, but the letter is believed to
be the first non-governmental protest.
	   China typically keeps a tight lid on civic protests, out of fear
that they could broaden into attacks on the ruling Communist Party.
Several of the letter signers have previously been imprisoned for
pro-democracy activities in China.
	   Women's rights groups estimate at least 168 women and girls,
most from the ethnic Chinese minority, were raped during the riots
that helped drive Indonesian President Suharto from power. Twenty
of the women reportedly were killed by their attackers or died
later of injuries.
	   Ethnic Chinese make up just 4 percent of Indonesia's population
but control an estimated 70 percent of the country's wealth.
Suspicious and envious of their success, Indonesians singled out
Chinese-owned homes and businesses for looting and burning during
the riots.
	   Outrage over the May attacks has galvanized ethnic Chinese
worldwide, sparking protests outside Indonesia's representative
offices in Taipei and Hong Kong.
	   Taiwan and China should unite to exert strong diplomatic,
economic, legal and political pressure to compel Indonesia to
punish the rapists, the letter said.
	   Jakarta should also compensate the victims, apologize for past
``appeasement and complicity,'' and guarantee such incidents will
never happen again, it said.

Wall Street's plunge sends shudders through global markets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: Incorporates material from BC-Asian Markets; will be led after
Wall Street opens, 1330 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC;

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Stock markets tumbled from Asia to Europe on
Wednesday, after a big drop on Wall Street rattled investor
sentiment.
	   ``It is unpleasant and nasty _ a white knuckle ride,'' said
Jeremy Batstone, an analyst at Natwest Stockbrokers in London.
	   Blue-chip prices were more than 2 percent lower on the London
Stock Exchange, Europe's biggest market, with similar red ink
showing up across trading screens in other key exchanges including
Frankfurt, Paris and Milan.
	   Some analysts urged shareholders not to panic _ but all eyes
were on Wall Street, which was opening later in the European
trading day.
	   Big losses on the New York Stock Exchange, where the Dow Jones
industrial average fell nearly 300 points on Tuesday, sent shudders
through smaller markets around the globe.
	   ``Investors just have to sit tight and see this downturn
through,'' said Ian Millward, an expert with the financial advisers
Chase de Vere in London. ``Markets are going to go down from time
to time, and this is not a major crash.''
	   Prices slid on many Asian markets, but the biggest one, the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, was able to recover from its early losses and
finish with a drop of just 0.2 percent by the key Nikkei index.
	   The limited losses in Tokyo gave traders some encouragement.
	   The Asian financial crisis is a major concern in global markets,
and attempts to fix Japan's weakened economy, the largest in the
region, is crucial to restoring stability and investor confidence.
	   Elsewhere in Asia, the picture was gloomier.
	   Hong Kong's Hang Seng index added to steep losses from earlier
in the week, while blue chips in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, have
tumbled to a nine-year low.
	   Experts on Wall Street said New York prices were hit largely by
concerns that profits will slip at many big U.S. multinationals.
The Asian crisis is taking its toll on many companies and
exacerbating concerns about the future direction of stock prices.
	   Some analysts are wondering whether the recent tumble in the
market is just another mini-correction or the start of a more
serious downturn.
	   European markets found themselves in an uncomfortable but
familiar position _ pushed lower as they were caught in the
cross-fire between the Asian markets and New York.

27 hill tribe rioters free on bail from Thai prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Twenty-seven hill tribesmen who rioted
outside a provincial police station last month have been freed on
bail, but 98 remain in prison, corrections officials said
Wednesday.
	   ``The rest are still waiting to be officially charged,'' said an
official at Mae Sot Provincial Prison, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``The list of charges being prepared against them is so
long.''
	   They include attempted murder, assault, breaking the peace,
theft and resisting arrest.
	   Police arrested 125 members of the Hmong hill tribe on July 17
after a protest turned violent near Mae Sot, 370 kilometers (230
miles) northwest of Bangkok.
	   The Hmong were demonstrating against the earlier arrests of
three of their compatriots on drug trafficking charges, saying
police were committing abuses in Hmong villages near the Myanmar
border.
	   Myanmar, especially the border area near Thailand, is a major
producer of heroin and methamphetamine.
	   Police said the villagers started by blocking the road and
making threatening remarks before the situation got out of hand.
	   Sixty soldiers stationed in the area were sent to a nearby Hmong
village to prevent its residents from joining the protest.
	   Tension between Thai narcotics police and the Hmong hill tribes
has been building up in recent months as authorities have stepped
up their activities to combat methamphetamine abuse. They have
arrested more than 30 Hmong people in the past three months.
	   Ten protesters _ including three women _ and one police officer
were injured in Friday's clash.
	   Three women and one child are among the prisoners.
	   Interior Minister Sanan Kachornprasart has vowed to crack down
on Hmong drug traffickers, particularly at a temple near Bangkok.
	   In its editorial Wednesday, the Bangkok Post called Sanan's
promise a knee-jerk reaction, and noted that non-Hmong areas where
drug trafficking is rife are being ignored by the police.
	   ``The vast majority of the Hmong hill tribe people living in
Thailand and going about their lives legally and peacefully have
been slandered by Thai officials and a media too lazy to
distinguish between these good people and a few members of their
tribe who engage in criminal activities,'' the Post said.
	   ``Without a strong voice in Parliament or access to officials to
speak on their behalf, the Hmongs are an easy target for
persecution,'' the paper said.

<TEXT>
	   ITZHAR, West Bank (AP) _ Two Israeli settlers were ambushed and
killed as they patrolled an isolated Jewish settlement early
Wednesday, prompting right-wing calls for a suspension of talks
with Palestinians.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed the shooting with
his 12-member security Cabinet on Wednesday amid calls that he
freeze negotiations until the Palestinians handed over the
attackers.
	   Israeli radio reports said Netanyahu had promised settlers to
expand Itzhar, the settlement where the shootings occurred. The few
hundred residents of the settlement, built on an isolated West Bank
hilltop surrounded by Palestinian villages, are known for their
ideological extremism.
	   At a memorial service attended by hundreds of mourners Wednesday
afternoon in Jerusalem, there were calls for revenge.
	   Aviv Bushinsky, spokesman for Netanyahu, said the prime minister
takes a ``very grave view'' of the attack that killed two Jewish
seminary students.
	   ``He said that this proves the necessity of protecting the
security interests of the settlers in the negotiations with the
Palestinians,'' Bushinsky said.
	   Nabil Amr, an adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
member of the elected legislative council, said the attack
underlined the need for ``serious ideas'' from Israel to move the
peace process forward.
	   ``If Israel continues to waste time then that means we are
leaving the field open for others to do everything they want to end
the whole process, just like what happened last night,'' he said on
Israel Radio's Arabic service.
	   Negotiations have been stalled for months over a U.S. proposal
for Israel to withdraw from an additional 13 percent of the West
Bank, a move that would leave many settlements as islands inside
Palestinian-controlled zones.
	   Netanyahu, under pressure from the strong Jewish settler lobby
and right-wing members of his Cabinet, has insisted on changes in
the American plan, including more stringent counter-terrorism
measures by Palestinians.
	   Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel said two measures
Israel was insisting on were keeping control of roads used by
settlers and confiscation of illegal weapons from Palestinian
militants. ``The murder of these two Israelis is directly connected
to these two issues,'' he said.
	   Palestinian legislator Ziad Abu Zayyad noted, however, that the
shootings occurred on land still under full Israeli control, and
said Netanyahu's government was responsible for the killings
because it ``caused the failure of the peace process.''
	   ``As long as Israeli settlers are living inside the Palestinian
territories and among the Palestinian population, these things will
happen,'' he said.
	   Arafat, speaking Wednesday to Palestinian legislators, called on
the United States to make public its withdrawal plan and
``officially expose and declare who is responsible for the delay''
in reaching an agreement.
	   ``The Israeli government bears total responsibility for the
total freeze in the peace process and the total chaos that will
engulf the entire region if the peace process is destroyed,'' he
said.
	   Arafat said the United States should put ``real pressure'' on
Israel.
	   A senior Palestinian official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Arafat sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on Tuesday night saying that the Palestinians
had bent over backward to make peace and that it was time for the
United States to say ``Enough'' to the Israelis.
	   In his latest offer, rejected Tuesday by Arafat, Netanyahu
proposed withdrawing from 10 percent of the territory and turning
an additional 3 percent into a nature reserve where Israel's army
would retain overall security.
	   Settler leaders said even a 10 percent withdrawal would have
left Itzhar cut off and surrounded by Palestinian-controlled
territory. They said Wednesday's killings were a harbinger of
things to come if the pullback goes through.
	   ``This is a tragic example of what is likely to occur 10-fold
when troop redeployments are carried out. Itzhar and 18 other
settlements will be turned into isolated islands,'' said settler
council leader Ahron Dombe.
	   Michael Kleiner, a supporter of the settlers in the Israeli
Knesset, said talks with the Palestinians should be stopped until
Arafat's government hands over the attackers to Israel. He also
demanded Israel not go through with a reported plan to free 100
Palestinian prisoners.
	   Killed in the attack were Harel Binoun, 18, and Shlomo Livman,
24, both sons of prominent right-wing rabbis and students at the
Joseph's Tomb seminary in the heart of Nablus _ a focal point of
past confrontations between Palestinians and Jewish settlers.
	   Following the shootings, Israel placed a curfew on five
surrounding Palestinian villages and closed roads leading to Nablus
as troops searched the area for the shooters.
	   Moshe Yaalon, the army's West Bank commander, said the two
Israelis were patrolling outside the settlement about midnight when
they were shot by two attackers laying in ambush. One of the
Israelis was carrying a weapon, reportedly an M-16 assault rifle,
which was taken by the ambushers.
	   ``The terrorists apparently had planned this attack and knew
when the pickup truck would be coming by. They firing was carried
out from very close range,'' he said.
	   The four-wheel drive vehicle was riddled with bullets, and
Israel army radio said the attackers repeatedly fired into the
bodies of the Israelis to make sure they were dead.
	   An Israeli officer in the the West Bank told reporters that the
attackers repeatedly struck one of the settlers on the head with an
ax, as well.

Ukraine during World War II were re-buried in a new cemetery that
will eventually hold the remains of 10,000 Germans killed in the
war, a news report said Wednesday.
	   The funeral ceremony for 139 German soldiers took place Tuesday
at the newly opened cemetery near the village of Potilychi in
western region of Lviv, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Germany's war dead in Ukraine are currently buried in several
different places, and the new cemetery is designed to bring them to
the same plot of land.
	   About 10,000 German soldiers who died in the war will be
re-buried at the cemetery by 2015, which would make it Ukraine's
largest memorial for Germany's World War II dead.
	   In the war, the invading Nazis swept eastward across Ukraine in
1941 and then retreated westward in 1944. The west of Ukraine was
the site of the heaviest battles.
	   The cemetery, which occupies more than 2 hectares (4.94 acres),
was the site of a German war-time military hospital, and more than
300 existing graves date to that era.
	   Construction of the cemetery was carried out by Ukraine, which
received 480,000 German marks (dlrs 268,800) in aid from a German
foundation that oversees graves of World War II soldiers.

Police investigate bishop in case of missing dlrs 1.5 million.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Police are investigating a bishop of the
Cyprus Orthodox Church in connection with an alleged scam involving
dlrs 1.5 million, the attorney-general said Wednesday.
	   Attorney-General Alecos Markides said the probe had been
prompted by a complaint from three Portuguese businessmen who said
they had transferred the money to Bishop Chrysanthos of Limassol
for investment in bonds and shares. The money had apparently
disappeared.
	   The bishop has already been mentioned in connection with a fraud
case involving foreign exchange worth dlrs 3.7 million which is
being investigated by Scotland Yard, the London police's detective
department, and Cypriot police.
	   On Tuesday the Holy Synod of the Cyprus Orthodox Church
announced that it would also investigate the bishop's various
business deals.
	   The synod, the church's supreme body, criticized the bishop for
getting involved in financial commitments and business deals
without its approval.
	   Bishop Chrysanthos told reporters Tuesday that he welcomed any
investigation as he had nothing to hide.

International monitoring group defends work during Cambodian polls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The main group of international
observers who helped monitor Cambodia's parliamentary election
defended the quality and coverage of its work Wednesday against
criticism by opposition politicians.
	   The Joint International Observer Group, under United Nations
auspices, helped organize the deployment of more than 500 foreign
observers for the monthlong electoral process culminating in voting
on July 26.
	   ``The quality of the international observers, short- and
long-term, has been high,'' Sven Linder, the group's spokesman,
said in a written statement. ``Most of them had solid previous
experience from observing other elections, including several of
them elections held in this country in 1993.''
	   Sven Linder is also the chief observer for the European Union,
which contributed more than dlrs 11.5 million in aid for the
electoral process.
	   The group called election day procedures and the first day of
counting a success, saying the polls reflected ``in a credible way
the will of the Cambodian people.''
	   Cambodian leader Hun Sen's ruling party emerged the winner when
long-delayed election results were announced Wednesday.
	   The election was held one year after Hun Sen ousted Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, whose party won in 1993, as his co-premier in a
bloody coup. Hun Sen hopes the polls will bring a stamp of
legitimacy to his rule.
	   Prominent dissident leader Sam Rainsy said Tuesday that efforts
by the international observers to oversee the polls were
inadequate. He said the foreign observers spent less than 30
minutes at each of the limited number of polling stations they
visited on election day, for a total of 1,150 hours, compared to a
total of 105,300 hours of polling.
	   ``At best, JIOG observed barely 1 percent of the polling on July
26,'' the Sam Rainsy Party said in its statement. ``This hardly
qualifies JIOG or its chair to make sweeping statements about
fairness at the polls, let alone say that the outcome of the
election reflects the will of the Cambodian people.''
	   Sven Linder said 17 percent of all polling stations and 13
percent of all counting centers were covered by international
observers and that those visited were chosen at random.
	   ``This is sufficient and even high by international standards,
which normally require above 10 percent coverage in order to enable
observers to make a reliable assessment of the quality of an
election,'' he said, adding that ``it is regrettable that these
efforts are not appreciated in some places.''

Manchester United boss slams Kluivert over transfer talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Manchester United manager Alex
Ferguson, angered after Patrick Kluivert rejected a 9 million pound
(dlrs 14.63 million) move to Old Trafford, said he was duped into
believing the Dutch World Cup star wanted to join the team.
	   The 22-year-old striker turned down the offer from Manchester
United and elected to stay with Italian club AC Milan. He has not
ruled out a future move to Arsenal to link up with Dutch stars
Dennis Bergkamp and Marc Overmars.
	   Ferguson was critical of Kluivert's conduct during negotiations
and said the Dutch forward failed to realize the scale of the
opportunity he had turned down.
	   ``Maybe he doesn't know how big Manchester United is,'' Ferguson
said. ``I am very surprised he has not given himself the
opportunity to speak to us.
	   ``Now we hear that he wants to go to London. If that is where he
wants to live there is nothing we can do about it.''
	   Ferguson said his failure to sign Kluivert had made him more
determined to lure Dwight Yorke _ his other priority target this
season _ from Aston Villa.

Arab League says Sudan should remain united
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Arab League welcomed on Wednesday peace
talks between the Sudanese government and southern rebels but
stressed that Africa's biggest nation should remain united in any
settlement.
	   On Wednesday, representatives of the Sudanese government and
rebels held a second day in a new round of peace talks in Ethiopia.
The talks concentrated on the boundaries of southern Sudan and the
role of the Islam in that region.
	   In May, the government and the Sudan People's Liberation Army
agreed in principle to hold an internationally supervised
referendum on possible independence for southern Sudan _ but they
did not agree on the territory involved.
	   ``The secretariat-general of the Arab League expresses its hope
that this round leads to achieving peace and ending the war in
southern Sudan,'' said the statement by the 22-member Arab League.
	   But the statement added that the league ``reconfirms its fixed
stance based on preserving the unity of Sudan's peoples and
territories.''
	   The SPLA has been fighting various governments since 1983 for
greater autonomy for the south, which is the largely African,
Christian and animist, from the Islamic and Arab north. More than
1.5 million people have died in the fighting and resulting famines.
	   The Cairo-based Arab League also urged ``all sides to respond to
the international community's call for a cease-fire to enable
humanitarian relief'' to meet the latest threat of famine in
southern Sudan.
	   On Monday, the government announced a cease-fire to allow food
aid to get to some 1.5 million people facing starvation. The U.N.
World Food Program hopes to raise its monthly food drops to
southern Sudan from 9,500 tons to 15,000 tons in the largest
current aid operation in the world.

Refugee smuggler crashes van fleeing police; one minor injury

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ For the second time in a week, a driver attempting
to smuggle illegal immigrants into Germany crashed a vehicle trying
to flee police in Saxony state.
	   One of the 15 Asians riding in the van suffered minor injuries
after the driver struck a bus stop late Tuesday in the town of Aue,
25 kilometers (15 miles) north of the Czech border. The driver, an
accomplice and one of the illegal immigrants fled, but were later
arrested.
	   Last week, seven Kosovo Albanians were killed when the driver of
a van trying to smuggle them into Germany crashed at 120 kilometers
(75 miles) an hour while trying to flee police. Two Czech citizens
have been arrested on smuggling charges.

Iraqi Parliament speaker calls for ending cooperation with U.N.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new comments by Butler downplaying confrontation
and Iraqi Assembly recessing briefly; EDITS throughout to trim. &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's parliamentary speaker urged
President Saddam Hussein on Wednesday to suspend all cooperation
with international weapons inspectors if the eight-year-old U.N.
sanctions against the country are not lifted.
	   The statement by Sadoun Hammadi at a special session of the
National Assembly came amid a new dispute with the weapons
inspectors in charge of determining whether Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction.
	   The Assembly, which routinely backs Saddam, was called into
session to consider an unspecified plan by the Iraqi leader to end
the sanctions, which were imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in
1990, sparking the Gulf War.
	   The sanctions, which block the country from freely exporting its
most valuable commodity, oil, cannot be lifted until U.N.
inspectors certify that Iraq has destroyed its chemical and
biological weapons and long-range missiles.
	   The legislators were expected to approve Saddam's plan, which
has not been made public. The plan was first reported Tuesday by
the Iraqi News Agency after U.N. chief weapons inspector Richard
Butler cut short a visit to Baghdad, saying Iraq refused to
continue disarmament talks.
	   Hammadi, in his speech, referred to a resolution adopted in
November by the 250-member Assembly, which called for a complete
halt to cooperation with the weapons inspection program if the
sanctions were not lifted in six months.
	   ``The solution lies in the application by the leadership of the
Assembly's resolution,'' Hammadi said. ``We see that the resolution
should have been implemented ... and now we call for the
implementation.''
	   The Assembly went into recess after hearing a stream of
criticism of the United States and Butler by Iraqi officials and
returned in the afternoon.
	   Iraq's latest stand threatens to halt the U.N. Special
Commission's program launched in 1991 to uncover Iraq's illegal
weapons, a mission often disrupted by confrontations between Iraqi
and U.N. officials.
	   But Butler sought to play down the seriousness of the latest
argument. In a stopover in London en route to New York, Butler said
he already had told U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan by telephone
that the troubles should not be exaggerated.
	   ``I said very specifically to him that I don't think any of us
should describe this as a crisis,'' he told BBC radio.
	   Butler, who is expected to brief the U.N. Security Council on
Thursday, also said in an interview published Wednesday in the
Bahrain Tribune that the disarmament talks did not collapse. ``They
came to an early end,'' he said.
	   In London, Butler said he did not understand why Iraq's Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz cut short a meeting Monday since he told
Aziz the inspectors were ``very close'' to certifying Iraq had
destroyed its missiles and chemical weapons. Though he added they
were ``not close'' to solving the problem of biological weapons.
	   A day earlier, Butler said the latest impasse arose when Aziz
demanded that U.N. inspectors give Iraq a clean bill of health on
destruction of all its dangerous arms.
	   ``I told him that I cannot fulfill your demand because I don't
have the evidence,'' Butler said after flying into Bahrain en route
to New York. ``After I said that to him, Aziz replied, `Then we
can't talk any further.'''
	   Butler's political adviser, Gustavo Zlauvinen, said Aziz also
refused to accept a proposal to speed up the pace of weapons
inspections.
	   Criticism of Iraq by Britain and the United States also appeared
muted compared to past confrontations when the two countries
threatened military action.
	   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin
said Saddam had ``shot himself in the foot'' by mishandling a
chance to end economic sanctions. ``Iraq has only harmed itself,''
Rubin said.
	   Iraq's official newspapers stressed anew, meanwhile, that U.N.
weapons inspectors were cooperating in American plots against
Saddam's government by refusing to confirm that the country had
eliminated its weapons systems.
	   The daily Al-Thawra, the official paper of Saddam's ruling
party, ridiculed the idea that Iraq should be considered a threat
after the years of work by the inspectors.
	   ``After seven years of inspections, monitoring, obtaining
documents, destroying factories and ... searching presidential
sites, they say that Iraq is a threat,'' said the paper.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Laurent Kabila's government on Wednesday
accused neighboring Rwanda of sending troops across its borders
into eastern Congo, where ethnic Tutsi rebels reportedly captured
two major towns.
	   Fighting was reported on Tuesday in Bukavu near the border with
Rwanda and in the village of Kitona on the opposite side of Congo
near the Atlantic coastline.
	   It was unclear whether the fighting continued through Wednesday,
but Rwanda's state-run radio reported that rebels had captured
Bukavu and Goma, the two biggest towns in Congo's troubled eastern
Kivu region.
	   The report, which gave no details, could not be independently
confirmed.
	   Congolese government spokesman Didier Mumengi said there was
heavy fighting in the western village of Kitona on Tuesday, but
refused to elaborate on who was in control of the town or its
military base.
	   ``Almost 400 army forces have come from Rwanda and have caused
Congolese bloodshed,'' Mumengi said.
	   That battle began after rebel gunmen forced an airplane they had
hijacked to land in Kitona, about 225 kilometers (140 miles)
southwest of the capital, Kinshasa. The hijackers were believed to
be Banyamulenge ethnic fighters in the eastern city of Goma.
	   The rebellion began about a week after Kabila ordered all
Rwandan troops out of the country. He did not explain the move.
	   Kabila says Rwanda is behind the rebellion in the east. Rwanda
has denied the charge although Rwandan troops _ one-time allies of
Congo's president _ remain in the country against Kabila's wishes.
	   ``Our armed forces will secure the national integrity and will
restore the Congolese dignity and definitely end this fool
adventure,'' Mumengi said.
	   In Kinshasa, a truck convoy loaded with troops was seen rumbling
out of the city headed to the east.
	   Although Kinshasa was stunned by brief gun battles in two army
barracks on Monday, the mood in the city is relatively calm.
	   A dusk-to-dawn curfew was repealed Wednesday and businesses were
operating normally.
	   Mumengi called on the international community to monitor
Rwanda's activities and halt the bloodshed in Congo.
	   Rwanda's forces and its vice president, Paul Kagame, played a
key role in helping Kabila march to victory last year over longtime
Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. But that delicate alliance of
Kabila's rebels, Rwandan troops and Banyamulenge Tutsis from Congo
has unraveled and now threatens to topple the current government.
	   Two Tutsi groups _ Banyamulenge ethnic fighters and former
Rwandan troops who stayed in the country after Mobutu was
overthrown _ were leading the uprising against Kabila, accusing him
of widespread corruption and government mismanagement and nepotism.
	   Rwanda has increasingly complained that Kabila has done little
to increase security in the Great Lakes region of central Africa.
	   The vice governor of South Kivu province, Benjamin Serukiza,
said the Tutsi rebels had taken control of much of the province,
including Bukavu and its airport.
	   Kabila convened an emergency cabinet meeting on Tuesday to
discuss the government's response to the rebellion in the east and
to earlier gun battles at two military barracks in the capital.
	   After he came to power, Kabila kept Rwandan troops on as part of
his defense force until he ordered them out last week. A few days
earlier, he fired his chief military officer, a Rwandan Tutsi
soldier.
	   The ethnic Tutsi population in North Kivu has close links with
Rwanda, and Kabila's support and control of the region has been
faltering for months.

	   BERLIN (AP) _ Rescuers recovered the bodies of two elderly women
and a 13-year-old boy Wednesday from a Berlin apartment building
demolished by a suspected natural gas explosion.
	   A day after the explosion, hundreds of police and firefighters
working with dogs, heat and sound sensors searched for four
residents still missing. Workers used a crane, bulldozer and other
heavy equipment to dig through the rubble.
	   Hopes were raised that rescuers would find 13-year-old Sven
Tornow alive after his small, white dog was recovered unharmed
earlier Wednesday.
	   The boy was home alone when the early morning blast collapsed
the four-story apartment building, ripping it off its foundation
and sending a huge cloud of dust over the Steglitz neighborhood.
	   His father was at work and his mother already in a new apartment
that the family planned to move into on Friday.
	   The two elderly women whose bodies were found have not yet been
identified.
	   Fire chief Alfred Broemme blamed natural gas for the explosion.
However, police were still investigating the cause.

 &UR; Yugoslavia mines its border with Macedonia

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Yugoslavia has planted mines along its
border with Macedonia in Kosovo province, apparently to prevent
Albanian militants from crossing illegally and smuggling arms,
media and foreign observers reported Wednesday.
	   ``We have spotted the mines and we asked Belgrade and Skopje for
clarification,'' said Marc McEvoy, a spokesman for the U.N.
peacekeeping force in Macedonia.
	   The Macedonian media said the antipersonnel mines, which are
banned by some international conventions, have been placed at two
spots near Jezice, one of the main border crossings, on the
Yugoslav side of the border.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, run by Kosovo Albanian
leadership, said ethnic Albanians in the border town of General
Jankovic have also been warned about the presence of Serb-laid
mines.
	   With violence raging in Serbia's troubled Kosovo province, there
are increased fears the clashes could spill across the border into
Macedonia, which has its own substantial and restive ethnic
Albanian minority. The republics of Serbia and Montenegro make up
Yugoslavia.
	   The threat of a broader Balkan conflict prompted the U.N.
Security Council in July to authorize an additional 300 troops to
the 750-strong U.N. peacekeeping force already in Macedonia and
extend the force's mandate until the end of next February.
	   More than 400 people have been killed in Kosovo since the Serb
crackdown against Kosovo Albanian separatists began in February.

	   ARANYAPRATHET, Thailand (AP) _ Cambodian government troops
battled Wednesday with soldiers loyal to deposed co-prime minister
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, sending hundreds of Cambodian refugees
into Thailand.
	   Lt. Gen. Nhek Bunchhay, commander of Cambodian troops who
remained loyal to the prince when he was ousted in a bloody coup
last year, and Thai military officers confirmed that fighting had
raged since Monday inside Cambodia north of this border town.
	   Nhek Bunchhay and the Thais, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said that hundreds of government troops backed by tanks
and artillery attacked and occupied a pro-Ranariddh base Monday
near O Bei Choan, just north of Aranyaprathet.
	   Nhek Bunchhay claimed that pro-Ranariddh forces under another
commander, Lay Virak, had recaptured the base early Wednesday and
that fighting had died down.
	   Reporters on the Thai side, however, said automatic weapons and
rocket fire still could be heard from inside Cambodia.
	   The Thai officers said there were unconfirmed reports that nine
government troops had been killed and eight injured, while three
pro-Ranariddh soldiers had been killed and one hurt. Nhek Bunchhay
said only that seven government troops had died.
	   Gen. Ek Samon, the government's regional military commander,
confirmed that there had been fighting but characterized the
battles as minor clashes to prevent ``those extremists from trying
to steal cattle from the villagers.'' He gave no casualty figures.
	   The Thai officers said the fighting had chased 520 Cambodians
into Thailand seeking refuge. They were receiving food and
temporary shelter from the Thai army.
	   Strongman Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as co-premier last year and
held elections July 26 to legitimize his rule. Official results
finally released Wednesday gave Hun Sen a plurality of the popular
vote, with Ranariddh finishing second.
	   The fate of the soldiers who remained loyal to Ranariddh after
the coup remains uncertain. A cease-fire that had generally held
before the elections shows signs of coming apart, and Hun Sen has
refused to grant any kind of amnesty to Nhek Bunchhay.

Two Jewish settlers killed, right-wing calls for halt in talks

<TEXT>
	   ITZHAR, West Bank (AP) _ Two Israeli settlers were ambushed and
killed as they patrolled an isolated Jewish settlement in the West
Bank early Wednesday, prompting right-wing calls for a suspension
of talks with Palestinians.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed the shooting with
his 12-member security Cabinet on Wednesday amid calls that he
freeze negotiations until the Palestinians handed over the
attackers.
	   Israeli radio reports said Netanyahu had promised settlers to
expand Itzhar, the settlement where the shootings occurred. The few
hundred residents of the settlement, built on an isolated hilltop
surrounded by Palestinian villages, are zealously committed to
keeping biblical Israel _ including the West Bank _ in Jewish
hands.
	   There were calls for revenge Wednesday afternoon at a memorial
service in Jerusalem attended by hundreds of mourners.
	   ``How many can they kill and we'll keep sitting quietly?''
shouted one woman, Yaffa Cohen. ``An eye for an eye. One day Jewish
terrorists will rise and kill Arabs.''
	   ``We will build this land. We will keep this land. And we won't
turn it over to the hands of murderers,'' said Shaul Yaalom, a
legislator from the pro-settler National Religious Party, a partner
in Netanyahu's ruling coalition.
	   Aviv Bushinsky, spokesman for Netanyahu, said the prime minister
took a ``very grave view'' of the attack that killed two Jewish
seminary students.
	   ``He said that this proves the necessity of protecting the
security interests of the settlers in the negotiations with the
Palestinians,'' Bushinsky said.
	   Nabil Amr, an adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
member of the elected legislative council, said the attack
underlined the need for ``serious ideas'' from Israel to move the
peace process forward.
	   ``If Israel continues to waste time then that means we are
leaving the field open for others to do everything they want to end
the whole process, just like what happened last night,'' he said on
Israel Radio's Arabic service.
	   Negotiations have been stalled for months over a U.S. proposal
for Israel to withdraw from an additional 13 percent of the West
Bank, a move that would leave many settlements as islands inside
Palestinian-controlled zones.
	   Netanyahu, under pressure from the strong Jewish settler lobby
and right-wing members of his Cabinet, has insisted on changes in
the American plan, including more stringent counter-terrorism
measures by Palestinians.
	   Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel said two measures
demanded by Israel were keeping control of roads used by settlers
and confiscation of illegal weapons from Palestinian militants.
``The murder of these two Israelis is directly connected to these
two issues,'' he said.
	   Palestinian legislator Ziad Abu Zayyad noted, however, that the
shootings occurred on land still under full Israeli control, and
said Netanyahu's government was responsible for the killings
because it ``caused the failure of the peace process.''
	   ``As long as Israeli settlers are living inside the Palestinian
territories and among the Palestinian population, these things will
happen,'' he said.
	   Arafat, speaking Wednesday to Palestinian legislators, called on
the United States to make public its withdrawal plan and
``officially expose and declare who is responsible for the delay''
in reaching an agreement.
	   ``The Israeli government bears total responsibility for the
total freeze in the peace process and the total chaos that will
engulf the entire region if the peace process is destroyed,'' he
said.
	   Arafat urged the United States to put ``real pressure'' on
Israel.
	   A senior Palestinian official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Arafat sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on Tuesday saying that the Palestinians had bent
over backward to make peace and that it was time for the United
States to say ``Enough'' to the Israelis.
	   In his latest offer, rejected Tuesday by Arafat, Netanyahu
proposed withdrawing from 10 percent of the territory and turning
an additional 3 percent into a nature reserve where Israel's army
would retain overall security.
	   Settler leaders said even a 10 percent withdrawal would leave
Itzhar cut off and surrounded by Palestinian-controlled territory.
	   ``This is a tragic example of what is likely to occur 10-fold
when troop redeployments are carried out,'' settler leader Ahron
Dombe said of the killings. ``Itzhar and 18 other settlements will
be turned into isolated islands.''
	   Michael Kleiner, a supporter of the settlers in the Israeli
Knesset, said talks with the Palestinians should be stopped until
Arafat's government hands over the attackers to Israel. He also
demanded Israel call off a reported plan to free 100 Palestinian
prisoners.
	   Killed in the attack were Harel Binoun, 18, and Shlomo Livman,
24, both sons of prominent right-wing rabbis and students at the
Joseph's Tomb seminary in the heart of Nablus _ a focal point of
past confrontations between Palestinians and Jewish settlers.
	   Following the shootings, Israel placed a curfew on five
surrounding Palestinian villages and closed roads leading to Nablus
as troops searched the area for the shooters.
	   Moshe Yaalon, the army's West Bank commander, said the two
Israelis were patrolling outside the settlement about midnight when
they were shot by two attackers lying in ambush. One of the
Israelis was carrying a weapon, reportedly an M-16 assault rifle,
which was taken by the ambushers.
	   ``The terrorists apparently had planned this attack and knew
when the pickup truck would be coming by,'' he said. ``The firing
was carried out from very close range.''
	   The four-wheel drive vehicle was riddled with bullets, and
Israel army radio said the attackers repeatedly fired into the
bodies of the Israelis to make sure they were dead.
	   An Israeli officer in the the West Bank told reporters that the
attackers repeatedly struck one of the settlers on the head with an
ax, as well.

Death toll from floods rises to 64; 32 still missing

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Rescuers plucked four more bodies from
river estuaries on South Korea's south coast Wednesday, raising the
death toll from weekend flash floods to 64.
	   But as weeping family members watched from river banks,
authorities expressed concern that some of the 32 people still
missing may never be found.
	   ``This is turning into a prolonged search,'' said Kim Byong-gon,
a relief organizer at the Home Ministry.
	   Nearly all of the dead or missing were campers swept away by
raging torrents triggered by heavy rains in scenic Mount Chiri
National Park over the weekend. The park is 200 kilometers (125
miles) south of Seoul.
	   Disaster relief headquarters had earlier reported up to 50
people missing but the number dropped sharply after families
reported the return of some missing relatives.
	   Weather forecasters failed to predict the torrential rains. Many
camping families were engulfed while trying to flee in their cars.
	   Most of the bodies so far recovered were found miles downstream.
Officials feared some bodies may have been carried as far as the
sea, 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the park.

Floods in Iran leave 41 people dead and 33 missing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Flash floods have killed at least 41 people
in Iran this week, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported Wednesday. Another 33 people are missing.
	   Following heavy rains, the floods washed through the town of
Masouleh in the northern province of Gilan, destroying bridges and
houses and killing livestock. Twenty-nine people drowned, 30 went
missing and 18 were injured, the agency said.
	   In the northwestern province of Ardebil province, five people
drowned and three disappeared in floods that devastated farms,
homes and roads.
	   Four people were killed and four injured in West Azerbaijan
province, while in East Azerbaijan one person drowned in the
floods, the agency said.
	   The floods also hit 19 villages in the northern province of
Mazandaran, damaging 120 houses, schools and clinics.
	   Two people drowned in the western province of Hamedan.
	   The agency reported that rescue operations were under way in the
stricken areas.
	   Iran regularly suffers earthquakes, floods and landslides. On
Saturday, landslides triggered by heavy rains killed at least 32
people and injured 45 others in Gilan and Ardebil provinces.

Russian tax collection improves, but still below targets

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Improved tax collections in July show that Russia
is making progress in getting its budget in order under an
austerity program, Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said in an
interview published Wednesday.
	   Also, the government has not had to spend any of a dlrs 4.8
billion it recently received from the International Monetary Fund,
using the money instead to bolster the Central Bank's reserves,
Kiriyenko told the Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper.
	   The loan, part of a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package to be
released gradually as Russia cleans up its finances, helped avoid a
devaluation of the ruble, Kiriyenko said, according to the Interfax
news agency.
	   ``The country was nearing the edge. We have made a step back but
have not run far away from the precipice,'' he added.
	   Russia's tax collection figures are up, but receipts in August
will be lower than expected, partly because the Communist-dominated
parliament rejected some government plans for new tax laws before
breaking for summer vacation.
	   The sluggish tax reform progress may be a factor when the IMF
decides whether to release the next part of the loan next month.
	   International lenders are intent on keeping pressure on the
government to follow through with promises that have often melted
away in the past.
	   Tax receipts for August are expected to total 12.5 billion
rubles (dlrs 2 billion), up marginally from July, which was in turn
higher than June.
	   But none of the months will reach the target of 14.8 billion
rubles (dlrs 2.3 billion), Interfax reported.
	   Parliament's lower house, which is led by Communists, will
reconvene for a special session August 19-20 to consider a series
of austerity bills, some of which were rejected previously, Gennady
Seleznyov, the speaker of parliament, said Wednesday after meeting
Kiriyenko.
	   The government also plans to ask approval for up to six entirely
new bills from the parliament, which has blocked a number of
reforms the government has sought.
	   In other economic developments Wednesday:
	   _ The upcoming sale of a 5 percent stake in gas monopoly Gazprom
is attracting a number of potential foreign buyers, including Shell
and the Italian company ENI, Russian Deputy State Property Minister
Alexander Braverman said Wednesday.
	   _ Russia's stock market was down 3.3 percent at midday
Wednesday, mostly in response to the New York Stock Exchange's 300
point fall the day before.

media and foreign observers reported Wednesday.

Japan's finance minister says tax cuts larger than dlrs 41.8
</HEADLINE>
billion &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's finance minister said Wednesday the
government planned to cut taxes next year by a ``large number''
more than the 6 trillion yen (dlrs 41.8 billion) already agreed to
by the governing party's tax panel.
	   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said he also wants to cut the
effective corporate tax rate to around 40 percent from 46 percent.
	   Public broadcaster NHK and several newspapers said this could
result in an overall reduction of 1 trillion yen (dlrs 7 billion)
more than that originally envisaged by the panel.
	   Miyazawa did not specify a figure, telling a regular news
conference only that next year's tax cuts ``will be 6 trillion yen
(dlrs 41.8 billion) plus a rather large number.''
	   On Tuesday, Miyazawa and the Liberal Democratic Party's tax
panel agreed to cut income taxes next year by about 4 trillion yen
(dlrs 27.7 billion) for individuals and 2 trillion yen (dlrs 13.9
billion) for corporations.
	   The discussion of the tax cuts comes amid international pressure
for Japan to boost domestic demand and tackle its economic slump as
quickly as possible.
	   Japan's neighbors see its recession as dragging them down in
efforts to recover from the year-old Asian economic crisis. They
hope tax cuts will help by encouraging Japanese consumers and
companies to buy more of their products.
	   Miyazawa said that in a telephone conversation Tuesday, he
proposed a meeting in early September with U.S. Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin to discuss Japan's recent economic measures.
	   Miyazawa said he wants tax cuts for middle-income earners to be
``sizable,'' but didn't elaborate. He added that an upper limit
should be placed on the monetary amount of the tax cuts.
	   The LDP and government tax panels are expected to complete the
plan by the end of 1998.
	   Miyazawa reiterated that boosting domestic demand through tax
cuts takes precedence over Japan's goal of cutting its budget
deficit.
	   ``We decided that we want to meet the Japanese people's hopes''
for tax cuts, Miyazawa said. ``We are aware of Japan's (fiscal)
problems, but we can't chase two things at once.''
	   The government will be flexible in revising a set of financial
cleanup bills according to suggestions from opposition parties, he
said. The bills, including one that would enable government-run
``bridge banks'' to take over the operations of failed banks, were
submitted to Parliament Wednesday.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi is expected to discuss tax cuts and
financial cleanup bills in his policy statement scheduled for
Friday.

Police find fourth letter bomb allegedly sent by anarchists

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Suspected anarchists are carrying out a terrorist
campaign in Italy and Greece, burning cars and sending letter bombs
to avenge the prison suicide-deaths of two comrades.
	   Police discovered a letter bomb at a Rome post office Wednesday,
the fourth sent this week. Authorities disarmed the explosives
before they went off.
	   The latest letter was addressed to the head of parliament's
justice commission, Giuliano Pisapia, a former prosecutor who took
part in an investigation that landed three anarchists in jail for
theft and arson earlier this year.
	   On Tuesday, another prosecutor, a journalist and a politician,
all from Turin where the anarchists are based, received letters
containing explosives.
	   One of those jailed committed suicide in his cell in April.
Another, reportedly his 22-year-old girlfriend, was found dead in
her prison shower stall with a bed sheet around her neck in July.
	   The third was released from prison after staging a hunger
strike.
	   Last week in Athens, arsonists claiming they were protesting the
deaths of the Turin anarchists set fire to two cars belonging to
Italian Embassy officials and burned 10 other cars parked at Fiat
automobile dealerships.
	   There have been no arrests since the campaign began in Greece
last week.

Police in Russian Far East seize illegal cache of alcohol

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police in the eastern port city of Vladivostok
raided an operation selling illicit alcohol, seizing more than
500,000 rubles (dlrs 80,000) worth of liquor and tobacco, a news
report said Wednesday.
	   The Orpok company, a wholesale distributor, was raided twice in
three days, and police both times found batches of illicit alcohol
on sale with with numerous violations, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said.
	   Police in Russia's Far East have stepped up raids on dealers in
response to a sharp rise in the fake alcohol trade, ITAR-Tass said,
citing regional police chief Alexander Vasilyev.
	   Hundreds of people across Russia died last year after drinking
concoctions passed off as vodka, but which usually contained
low-quality alcohol.

killed as they patrolled an isolated Jewish settlement early
Wednesday, prompting right-wing calls for a suspension of talks
with Palestinians.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed the shooting with
his 12-member security Cabinet on Wednesday amid calls that he
freeze negotiations until the Palestinians hand over the attackers.
	   Israeli radio reports said Netanyahu had promised settlers to
expand Itzhar, the settlement where the shootings occurred. The few
hundred residents of the settlement, built on an isolated West Bank
hilltop surrounded by Palestinian villages, are known for their
ideological extremism.
	   Michael Kleiner, a supporter of the settlers in the Israeli
Knesset, said talks with the Palestinians should be stopped until
Arafat's government hands over the attackers to Israel. He also
demanded Israel not go through with a reported plan to free 100
Palestinian prisoners.
	   At a memorial service attended by hundreds of mourners Wednesday
afternoon in Jerusalem, there were calls for revenge.
	   ``How many can they kill and we'll keep sitting quietly?''
shouted one woman, Yaffa Cohen. ``An eye for an eye. One day Jewish
terrorists will rise and kill Arabs.''
	   Aviv Bushinsky, spokesman for Netanyahu, said the prime minister
takes a ``very grave view'' of the attack that killed two Jewish
seminary students.
	   ``He said that this proves the necessity of protecting the
security interests of the settlers in the negotiations with the
Palestinians,'' Bushinsky said.
	   Nabil Amr, an adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
member of the elected legislative council, said the attack
underscored the need for ``serious ideas'' from Israel to move the
peace process forward.
	   ``If Israel continues to waste time then that means we are
leaving the field open for others to do everything they want to end
the whole process, just like what happened last night,'' he said on
Israel Radio's Arabic service.
	   Negotiations have been stalled for months over a U.S. proposal
for Israel to withdraw from an additional 13 percent of the West
Bank, a move that would leave many settlements as islands inside
Palestinian-controlled zones.
	   Netanyahu, under pressure from the strong Jewish settler lobby
and right-wing members of his Cabinet, has insisted on changes in
the American plan, including more stringent counter-terrorism
measures by Palestinians.
	   Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel said Israel was
insisting on keeping control of roads used by settlers and of
confiscating illegal weapons from Palestinian militants. ``The
murder of these two Israelis is directly connected to these two
issues,'' he said.
	   Palestinian legislator Ziad Abu Zayyad noted, however, that the
shootings occurred on land still under full Israeli control, and
said Netanyahu's government was responsible for the killings
because it ``caused the failure of the peace process.''
	   ``As long as Israeli settlers are living inside the Palestinian
territories and among the Palestinian population, these things will
happen,'' he said.
	   Arafat, speaking Wednesday to Palestinian legislators, urged the
United States to make public its withdrawal plan and ``officially
expose and declare who is responsible for the delay'' in reaching
an agreement.
	   ``The Israeli government bears total responsibility for the
total freeze in the peace process and the total chaos that will
engulf the entire region if the peace process is destroyed,'' he
said.
	   Arafat said the United States should put ``real pressure'' on
Israel.
	   In his latest offer, rejected Tuesday by Arafat, Netanyahu
proposed withdrawing from 10 percent of the territory and turning
an additional 3 percent into a nature reserve where Israel's army
would retain overall security.
	   Killed in the attack were Harel Binoun, 18, and Shlomo Livman,
24, both sons of prominent right-wing rabbis and students at the
Joseph's Tomb seminary in the heart of Nablus _ a focal point of
past confrontations between Palestinians and Jewish settlers.
	   Moshe Yaalon, the army's West Bank commander, said the two
Israelis were patrolling outside the settlement about midnight when
they were shot by two attackers laying in ambush.

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Government-controlled Radio Rwanda said
Wednesday the eastern Congolese towns of Goma and Bukavu were in
the hands of rebels opposed to President Laurent Kabila.
	   Kabila accuses Rwanda of backing attempts to oust him and to sow
chaos in the eastern part of the vast Democratic Repbublic of
Congo.
	   A Rwandan official, who asked not to be further identified, said
Bizima Karaha, an ethnic Tutsi who has been Congolese Foreign
Minister since Kabila assumed power in May 1997, had arrived in
Goma, apparently to take up sides with the rebels.
	   Karaha did not return to Kinshasa from South Africa as scheduled
earlier this week, giving rise to speculation that he may have
sought political asylum in South Africa.
	   The Rwandan government denies any role in the eastern rebellion
or in revolts by ethnic Tutsi soldiers in Kinshasa, but various
officials have said they are not suprised by the turn of events.
	   But humanitarian sources have reported significant movement of
Rwandan troops in North Kivu province around Beni, Butembo and
Rutshuru and Goma and in Bukavu in South Kivu province.
	   The private Rwandan News Agency reported Tuesday that members of
the Alliance of Democratic Forces that brought Kabila to power in
May 1996 after an eight-month march across Zaire have come out in
support of the rebellion.
	   Citing a Tuesday night broadcast on Goma radio, RNA said nine
ADFL members it did not further identify from several different
ethnic groups accused Kabila of ``making freedom fighters, senior
politicians and army commanders regret their contribution to the
liberation war.''
	   Rwanda and its southern neighbor, Burundi, have closed their
borders with the Congo. But Uganda, north of Rwanda, said Wednesday
its border remains open, and people and goods continue to cross.
	   ``As of now, our borders with the Congo are still open. Our
nationals and diplomats there are safe,'' a Foreign Ministry
spokesman said.
	   Rwanda and Uganda backed Kabila's eight-month rebellion that
began in what was then eastern Zaire in October 1996 and supported
his Alliance of Democratic Forces in its drive to oust dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Laurent Kabila's government on Wednesday
accused neighboring Rwanda of sending troops across its borders
into eastern Congo, where ethnic Tutsi rebels reportedly captured
two major towns.
	   Fighting was reported on Tuesday in Bukavu near the border with
Rwanda and in the village of Kitona on the opposite side of Congo
near the Atlantic coastline.
	   It was unclear whether the fighting continued through Wednesday,
but Rwanda's state-run radio reported that rebels had captured
Bukavu and Goma, the two biggest towns in Congo's troubled eastern
Kivu region.
	   The report, which gave no details, could not be independently
confirmed.
	   Congolese government spokesman Didier Mumengi said there was
heavy fighting in the western village of Kitona on Tuesday, but
refused to elaborate on who was in control of the town or its
military base.
	   ``Almost 400 army forces have come from Rwanda and have caused
Congolese bloodshed,'' Mumengi said.
	   That battle began after rebel gunmen forced an airplane they had
hijacked to land in Kitona, about 225 kilometers (140 miles)
southwest of the capital, Kinshasa. The hijackers were believed to
be Banyamulenge ethnic fighters in the eastern city of Goma.
	   The rebellion began about a week after Kabila ordered all
Rwandan troops out of the country. He did not explain the move.
	   Kabila says Rwanda is behind the rebellion in the east. Rwanda
has denied the charge although Rwandan troops _ one-time allies of
Congo's president _ remain in the country against Kabila's wishes.
	   ``Our armed forces will secure the national integrity and will
restore the Congolese dignity and definitely end this fool
adventure,'' Mumengi said.
	   In Kinshasa, a truck convoy loaded with troops was seen rumbling
out of the city headed to the east.
	   Although Kinshasa was stunned by brief gun battles in two army
barracks on Monday, the mood in the city is relatively calm.
	   A dusk-to-dawn curfew was repealed Wednesday and businesses were
operating normally.
	   Mumengi called on the international community to monitor
Rwanda's activities and halt the bloodshed in Congo.
	   Rwanda's forces and its vice president, Paul Kagame, played a
key role in helping Kabila march to victory last year over longtime
Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. But that delicate alliance of
Kabila's rebels, Rwandan troops and Banyamulenge Tutsis from Congo
has unraveled and now threatens to topple the current government.
	   Two Tutsi groups _ Banyamulenge ethnic fighters and former
Rwandan troops who stayed in the country after Mobutu was
overthrown _ were leading the uprising against Kabila, accusing him
of widespread corruption and government mismanagement and nepotism.
	   Rwanda has increasingly complained that Kabila has done little
to increase security in the Great Lakes region of central Africa.
	   The vice governor of South Kivu province, Benjamin Serukiza,
said the Tutsi rebels had taken control of much of the province,
including Bukavu and its airport.
	   Kabila convened an emergency cabinet meeting on Tuesday to
discuss the government's response to the rebellion in the east and
to earlier gun battles at two military barracks in the capital.
	   After he came to power, Kabila kept Rwandan troops on as part of
his defense force until he ordered them out last week. A few days
earlier, he fired his chief military officer, a Rwandan Tutsi
soldier.
	   The ethnic Tutsi population in North Kivu has close links with
Rwanda, and Kabila's support and control of the region has been
faltering for months.

 &UR; Serbs buried victims at garbage dump &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with some 50 graves found at garbage dump
outside Orahovac, more fighting; CHANGES dateline, byline &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Dozens of ethnic Albanians have been
buried at a garbage dump later leveled by bulldozers after Serb
forces overran a separatist stronghold in Kosovo last month, ethnic
Albanian media reported Wednesday.
	   The village of Orahovac, 50 kilometers (31 miles) southwest of
Pristina, was the scene of fierce battles in July between Serb
forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army fighting for independence for
Kosovo.
	   At least 60 civilians were killed in five days of fighting in
Orahovac, which fell into Serb hands on July 20, according to the
Pristina-based Committee for the Protection of Human Rights.
	   At a garbage dump about one kilometer (half-mile) outside
Orahovac, an Associated Press Television crew saw about 50 small
mounds of earth, marked with sticks, some of them bearing ethnic
Albanian names, others just numbers.
	   A small bulldozer which apparently leveled the terrain was still
at the site Wednesday.
	   Veton Surroi, a prominent ethnic Albanian politician who visited
the site Tuesday, claimed that as many as 200 Albanians were killed
in Orahovac, most of them in a mosque where they had taken refuge.
	   And in Vienna, Austria, the respected newspaper Die Presse said
Wednesday reporters had found fresh graves of more than 500 people,
including children, in the Orahovac area.
	   A Serb police source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
police had buried ``a number of bodies'' in the Orahovac area after
no one claimed them from a morgue after more than a week.
	   Fighting continued Wednesday between ethnic Albanian separatists
and Serb security forces in the central Kosovo region of Drenica,
according to ethnic Albanian sources.
	   Milosevic sent forces to crush the KLA in March. Kosovo, located
in Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia, has a population of
2 million. Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
	   Continued fighting has stymied plans to send international aid
convoys to help refugees. Serb police have been barring or slowing
aid groups and diplomatic observers from reaching tens of thousands
of refugees driven from Kosovo villages.
	   The International Committee of the Red Cross has reached the
valley near Qirez, but the hostilities have stalled the project.
	   Qirez, a village located about 22 kilometers (14 miles)
northwest of Pristina, is in a refugee-filled valley in the western
Drenica region _ the target of a Serb onslaught now in its ninth
day.
	   When aid workers arrived Tuesday in Qirez, they found hundreds
of desperate people. Refugees crowded around a truck loaded with
boxes of infant medicine, food and other supplies. Many have been
subsisting on a diet of water and green peppers.
	   Drenica, historically a center of ethnic Albanian nationalism,
is the largest area still under KLA control. From the hilltops,
smoke was visible Tuesday from burning villages _ including the
former stronghold of Lausa _ now overrun by Serb police in a
symbolic defeat for the KLA.

Rights activist says 11 mass graves found in Indonesian province

 &UR; Eds: One name correct for Rufriadi &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A human rights group said Wednesday it
had found 11 mass graves, possibly containing hundreds of bodies of
people allegedly killed by Indonesian troops in the troubled
northernmost province of Aceh.
	   Rufriadi, a lawyer at the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation in the
provincial capital of Banda Aceh, said he and another human rights
activist found the graves in four remote locations on the northern
tip of Sumatra Island last month.
	   He estimated that each burial site could contain as many 50
bodies and that other burial sites might also exist.
	   ``There are at least eight mass graves in villages in North Aceh
regency, and one each in Central Aceh, East Aceh and Pidie
regencies,'' Rufriadi said.
	   One of the sites was nicknamed ``Skull Hill'' by local people.
	   There was no immediate comment from the military.
	   However, a parliamentary team that went to the province last
week to investigate allegations of human rights abuses denied
earlier local media reports that it had found evidence of mass
graves.
	   The Indonesian military has long been accused of arbitrary
killing and torture in Aceh, a strongly Muslim province about 1,750
kilometers (1,100 miles) northwest of Jakarta.
	   Some human rights groups claim thousands of people have been
killed there since a separatist rebellion started in the late
1980s.
	   The province has endured rebellions for generations dating back
to Dutch colonial times several centuries ago.
	   In a telephone interview, Rufriadi told The Associated Press
that local villagers had shown him the mass grave sites.
	   They alleged elite Indonesian troops had shot the victims.
	   ``They include villagers who claimed to have been forced to bury
the dead bodies under gunpoint,'' Rufriadi said. ``They all say
that it was the work of the military.''
	   Besides the mass graves, Rufriadi said he had located a
traditional village house that local people alleged had been used
as a torture center by troops.
	   Allegations of mass graves follow a separate investigation into
accusations that elite troops kidnapped dozens of anti-government
activists in the weeks before authoritarian former President
Suharto stepped down in May.
	   Aceh, one of three Indonesian provinces where rebels are
fighting for independent states, was put under the status of
Military Operation Region in 1991.
	   The other two provinces are Irian Jaya in the western part of
New Guinea and the former Portuguese colony of East Timor.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Heavyweight boxer Andrew Golota, known for
low blows, legal woes and accompanying fines, wants his upcoming
fight in his native Poland to launch a new phase of his notorious
career.
	   At 30 years old, with a record of 31-3 with 27 knockouts, the
husky Pole knows his chances for another title fight are dwindling.
	   So he hopes the Oct. 2 bout in Wroclaw against former champion
Tim Witherspoon enhances his local hero image and entrenches
professional boxing in his Central European homeland.
	   ``There's pressure,'' he conceded Wednesday at a news conference
after he arrived in Poland following a unanimous decision two weeks
ago over Corey Sanders in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in the United
States.
	   Organizers hope the Golota-Witherspoon bout, billed as the first
professional heavyweight fight ever staged in Poland, shows Poland
can stage world-class boxing. Tickets will have world-class prices
_ as high as 1,000 zlotys (almost dlrs 300), which is more than
many Poles earn in a month.
	   For Golota, it represents even more. Two years after winning the
bronze medal at the 1988 Olympics, he fled to Chicago in the United
States to avoid assault charges stemming from a 1990 bar brawl in
Poland.
	   Trained by Lou Duva, Golota became known as a tough but dirty
fighter _ prone to head butts, biting and low blows _ in compiling
an impressive record that brought a 1996 title fight with Riddick
Bowe.
	   Most observers thought Golota was leading when he was
disqualified in the seventh round for repeated low blows. A
chair-swinging brawl erupted in the ring afterward when Bowe
supporters attacked Golota.
	   In the rematch, Golota again was disqualified for low blows. He
then returned to Poland to visit his mother and face the criminal
charges, which resulted in a dlrs 7,000 fine.
	   The worst blow came last year, when WBC champion Lennox Lewis
knocked Golota out in the first round. Golota said after the fight
he was too nervous, but New Jersey boxing commissioner Larry
Hazzard later fined him dlrs 5,000 for secretly using a painkiller
_ lidocaine _ 90 minutes before the opening bell.
	   Three victories later, the 240-pound (110-kilogram) Golota takes
on the 40-year-old Witherspoon (46-7, with 31 knockouts) with more
at stake than ever before.
	   ``It's not just coming home,'' his wife, Mariola, said
Wednesday. ``It's about trying to bring boxing into Poland. We're
trying to make it world-class.''
	   Golota was on his best behavior, answering questions patiently
and posing for all photographs requested. Asked about Witherspoon,
he sounded almost contrite.
	   ``He's always dangerous,'' Golota said. ``I hear he's training
hard and I'll be ready.''
	   A convincing victory could bring another title shot, Duva has
said. Golota insisted he didn't care who was next.
	   ``I don't prefer anybody,'' he said. ``I have to fight somebody,
you know.''

Former spy served with injunction in New Zealand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A former British spy who served a four-month
prison sentence for trying to sell his story has been served with
an injunction in New Zealand in an attempt to prevent him from
making new ``damaging disclosures,'' the Foreign Office said
Wednesday.
	   New Zealand courts granted a temporary injunction against
Richard Tomlinson, 35, an aeronautical engineering graduate from
Cambridge University who worked for Britain's foreign intelligence
agency MI6. The Foreign Office said the injunction was served as
Tomlinson arrived in Auckland early Wednesday.
	   The Foreign Office sought the injunction against Tomlinson, who
has dual British and New Zealand citizenship, after David Shayler,
a former agent for the MI5 internal security service, was arrested
in Paris on Saturday.
	   Shayler, who disclosed details of the domestic intelligence
agency to a British tabloid The Daily Mail, was planning to divulge
further details of MI5 operations on an Internet website, according
to The Sunday Times.
	   The paper said Shayler was working with Tomlinson.
	   A Foreign Office spokesman said Tomlison could ``cause
substantial harm to the operations of the Secret Intelligence
Service and in some cases put life and livelihoods at risk.''
	   ``There is no question of taking this action to stifle criticism
of the Secret Intelligence Service. The reason for the action is to
protect the secrecy of the service's operations and maintain its
effectiveness,'' the spokesman said, speaking with customary
anonymity.
	   Tomlinson was given a 12-month jail sentence for an offense
against the Official Secrets Act in December. He admitted trying to
sell his story to an Australian publisher after a four-year career
with MI6 that took him to Moscow and Bosnia.
	   He was released from Belmarsh Prison in south London on parole
in April. He is prevented by a High Court injunction from
publishing any book in Britain.
	   The Foreign Office said it will seek a permanent injunction in a
New Zealand court to prevent Tomlison ``from making further
damaging disclosures in breach of his contractual obligations.''
	   ``The New Zealand government have demonstrated their support.
The attorney general in New Zealand has filed an affidavit which
supports the bringing of this action in the New Zealand courts,''
the Foreign Office spokesman said.
	   Britain has said it will seek Shayler's extradition from France.
His lawyer, John Wadham, said he will fight extradition ``because
his only fault was to disclose malpractice and abuse within MI5.''

UN envoy extends emergency visit to Angola

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ A U.N. envoy on an emergency mission to
Angola on Wednesday postponed his departure for three days to give
himself more time to prevent the country's fragile peace process
from collapsing.
	   Sent by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Lakhdar Brahimi
arrived in Angola last Friday following the sudden escalation of
tension with the recent massacre of 100 civilians in a remote
village and reported military buildup on both sides. He had been
scheduled to leave Wednesday.
	   ``The extension of Brahimi's stay is evidence of the
secretary-general's interest in Angola's peace process,'' U.S.
Ambassador Donald Steinberg said.
	   About 500,000 people died in Angola's two-decade-long civil war
before a U.N.-brokered deal in 1994 established a tenuous peace
between government troops and those of the UNITA rebel group.
	   Implementation of the accord has been hit by delays, including
UNITA's refusal to relinquish control of its four last remaining
rural strongholds.
	   Few details were given about Brahimi's extended agenda, or
whether he would meet again with President Eduardo Dos Santos and
UNITA chief Jonas Savimbi.
	   Of his first meeting with Dos Santos, Brahimi said: ``The
president promised to end the government's hostile propaganda''
against UNITA.
	   Savimbi, meanwhile, ``promised to send his political
representatives back to Luanda before Saturday'' he added. UNITA
formally reopened its offices in Luanda in early June but its
leaders remain in the movement's highland strongholds.
	   Brahimi is scheduled to meet with Deputy Foreign Minister Joao
Bernardo Miranda and Cardinal Alexandre do Nascimento, Luanda's
Archbishop, on Wednesday.
	   He said he would give a press conference Saturday before
departing for Namibia to meet with President Sam Nujoma. In July
Nujoma and Dos Santos agreed on a ``security pact'' to contain
UNITA.
	   Ambassador Steinberg confirmed that the U.N. Security Council in
New York would discuss Angola on Friday.
	   The United States, Portugal and Russia make up the so-called
``troika'' of states overseeing the Angolan peace process.
	   In his stay, Brahimi has also been gathering information to help
the U.N. chose a permanent representative for Angola to succeed
Alioune Blondin Beye, a key player in the 1994 accord, who died in
an air crash in the Ivory Coast in June.

Senior Malaysian journalist resigns, joining two others
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A senior executive at Malaysia's
biggest private television company has resigned, apparently after
being pressured by ruling party officials, sources at the station
said Wednesday.
	   Yunus Said, the operations director at TV3, left his office
abruptly on Tuesday, they said. He could not be reached for
comment.
	   His departure came just weeks after Johan Jaafar and Ahmad Nazri
Abdullah, the editors in chief of the country's two most
influential Malay-language newspapers, Berita Harian and Utusan
Malaysia, quit within five days of each other.
	   Both newspapers are widely read by the ruling party's political
constituency. Media sources said Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
had privately upbraided the editors over the papers' coverage of
charges of cronyism and nepotism leveled by Mahathir's detractors
at the annual convention of his United Malays National Organization
party in June.
	   ``All three of them are great buddies in their daily lives,'' a
TV3 journalist, who requested anonymity, said of Yunus and the two
editors.
	   Executives at TV3 have yet to appoint Yunus' successor, he said.
	   TV3, Malaysia's first private television station, is operated by
a publicly listed company that has close ties to Mahathir's party.
	   Analysts say it is easy to force journalists to comply with
government regulation because authorities can easily cancel annual
publishing licenses.
	   Political leaders have traditionally appointed editors. Johan
took over at Utusan Malaysia in 1992 after his predecessor fell out
of favor with Mahathir. Yunus had also served a stint as assistant
group editor of the paper.
	   In the 17 years that he has ruled Malaysia, Mahathir has shown
little patience for criticism. In a nationwide crackdown on dissent
in 1987, three national newspapers were closed down.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Dozens of ethnic Albanians have been
buried at a garbage dump later leveled by bulldozers after Serb
forces overran a separatist stronghold in Kosovo last month, ethnic
Albanian media reported Wednesday.
	   The village of Orahovac, 50 kilometers (31 miles) southwest of
Pristina, was the scene of fierce battles in July between Serb
forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army fighting for independence for
Kosovo.
	   At least 60 civilians were killed in five days of fighting in
Orahovac, which fell into Serb hands on July 20, according to the
Pristina-based Committee for the Protection of Human Rights.
	   At a garbage dump about one kilometer (half-mile) outside
Orahovac, an Associated Press Television crew saw about 50 small
mounds of earth, marked with sticks, some of them bearing ethnic
Albanian names, others just numbers.
	   A small bulldozer which apparently leveled the terrain was still
at the site Wednesday.
	   Veton Surroi, a prominent ethnic Albanian politician who visited
the site Tuesday, claimed that as many as 200 Albanians were killed
in Orahovac, most of them in a mosque where they had taken refuge.
	   And in Vienna, Austria, the respected newspaper Die Presse said
Wednesday reporters had found fresh graves of more than 500 people,
including children, in the Orahovac area.
	   A Serb police source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
police had buried ``a number of bodies'' in the Orahovac area after
no one claimed them from a morgue after more than a week.
	   Fighting continued Wednesday between ethnic Albanian separatists
and Serb security forces in the central Kosovo region of Drenica,
according to ethnic Albanian sources.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic sent forces to crush the
KLA in March. Kosovo, located in Serbia, the dominant republic of
Yugoslavia, has a population of 2 million. Albanians outnumber
Serbs 9-to-1.
	   Continued fighting has stymied plans to send international aid
convoys to help refugees. Serb police have been barring or slowing
aid groups and diplomatic observers from reaching tens of thousands
of refugees driven from Kosovo villages.
	   The International Committee of the Red Cross has reached the
valley near Qirez, but the hostilities have stalled the project.
	   Qirez, a village located about 22 kilometers (14 miles)
northwest of Pristina, is in a refugee-filled valley in the western
Drenica region _ the target of a Serb onslaught now in its ninth
day.
	   When aid workers arrived Tuesday in Qirez, they found hundreds
of desperate people. Refugees crowded around a truck loaded with
boxes of infant medicine, food and other supplies. Many have been
subsisting on a diet of water and green peppers.
	   Drenica, historically a center of ethnic Albanian nationalism,
is the largest area still under KLA control. From the hilltops,
smoke was visible Tuesday from burning villages _ including the
former stronghold of Lausa _ now overrun by Serb police in a
symbolic defeat for the KLA.

	   ARANYAPRATHET, Thailand (AP) _ Cambodian government troops
battled Wednesday with soldiers loyal to deposed co-Prime Minister
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, sending hundreds of Cambodian refugees
into Thailand.
	   Lt. Gen. Nhek Bunchhay, commander of Cambodian troops who
remained loyal to the prince when he was ousted in a bloody coup
last year, and Thai military officers confirmed that fighting had
raged since Monday inside Cambodia north of this border town.
	   Nhek Bunchhay and the Thais, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said that hundreds of government troops backed by tanks
and artillery attacked and occupied a pro-Ranariddh base Monday
near O Bei Choan, just north of Aranyaprathet.
	   Nhek Bunchhay claimed that pro-Ranariddh forces under another
commander, Lay Virak, had recaptured the base early Wednesday and
that fighting had died down.
	   Reporters on the Thai side, however, said automatic weapons and
rocket fire still could be heard from inside Cambodia.
	   The Thai officers said there were unconfirmed reports that nine
government troops had been killed and eight injured, while three
pro-Ranariddh soldiers had been killed and one hurt. Nhek Bunchhay
said only that seven government troops had died.
	   Gen. Ek Samon, the government's regional military commander,
confirmed that there had been fighting but characterized the
battles as minor clashes to prevent ``those extremists from trying
to steal cattle from the villagers.'' He gave no casualty figures.
	   The Thai officers said the fighting had chased 520 Cambodians
into Thailand seeking refuge. They were receiving food and
temporary shelter from the Thai army.
	   Strongman Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as co-premier last year and
held elections July 26 to legitimize his rule. Official results
finally released Wednesday gave Hun Sen a plurality of the popular
vote, with Ranariddh finishing second.
	   The fate of the soldiers who remained loyal to Ranariddh after
the coup remains uncertain. A cease-fire that had generally held
before the elections shows signs of coming apart, and Hun Sen has
refused to grant any kind of amnesty to Nhek Bunchhay.

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The alliance fighting the Taliban
religious militia claimed a victory Wednesday in fighting in
eastern Afghanistan, while two front lines just outside their
northern stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif were reported calm.
	   Abdullah, a spokesman for alliance leader Ahmed Shah Masood,
said Masood's troops captured 25 Taliban bunkers after a
``successful offensive'' east of Kunduz province, several hundred
kilometers (miles) east of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   The alliance is backed into a small corner of northern
Afghanistan. With Mazar-e-Sharif in is sights, the Taliban appear
poised to capture all of the country.
	   Fifty Taliban soldiers were killed and 112 captured in
Wednesday's eastern fighting, Abdullah said, making no mention of
alliance casualties. Taliban officials could not immediately be
reached for comment on Abdullah's report.
	   Earlier, Taliban officials reported no fighting around
Mazar-e-Sharif, the northern alliance's last major stronghold.
Taliban fighters are reportedly closing in on Mazar-e-Sharif on two
sides, with the front lines about 20 kilometers (12 miles) to the
west and 40 kilometers (25 miles) to the east.
	   Taliban spokesman Abdul Hay Muttayn said Tuesday that the
religious militia was pausing to build bunkers and take other
measures to shore up defenses around Mazar-e-Sharif. It was unclear
when it would attempt to capture the city.
	   Their hesitancy comes after a brutal defeat last May, when the
Taliban retreated from Mazar-e-Sharif after street battles in which
hundreds of Taliban soldiers died. As many as 2,000 Taliban
prisoners of war reportedly were later massacred.
	   ``We will once again beat the Taliban in the North,'' said
Masood spokesman Abdullah, who like many Afghans uses one name
only.
	   Abdullah spoke by telephone from London, from where he said he
had been in touch with Masood in northern Afghanistan. Masood said
all the alliance leaders were in northern Afghanistan, but would
not specify where.
	   A day earlier, Taliban fighters claimed to have captured
Saripul, a town about 100 kilometers (60 miles) southwest of
Mazar-e-Sharif, and the surrounding province of the same name.
Abdullah acknowledged Wednesday that the Taliban were in Saripul,
but said they continued to face resistance there.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran is building eight hydroelectric power
plants with a combined generation capacity of 8,000 megawatts, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Wednesday.
	   The eight plants will gradually come on stream and should all be
fully operational by 2006, Energy Minister Habibollah Bitaraf told
the agency.
	   The minister said Iran needs to add between 1,600 and 2,000
megawatts of power to its grid in order to meet the eight percent
annual growth in its energy consumption.
	   ____
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The European Union has agreed to grant
Lebanon dlrs 42 million for the rehabilitation of its civil
service, Lebanese newspapers said Wednesday.
	   The agreement was signed in Beirut Tuesday by Minister of
Administrative Reform Beshara Merhej and the Lebanese
representative of the European Commission, Dimitri Kourkoulas.
	   The rehabilitation ``will open the way for the establishment of
a modern, smaller, but more effective administration,'' Merhej told
the newspaper An-Nahar.
	   The grant is the European Union's second donation to the
Lebanese civil service in two years. It follows a dlrs 48 million
gift in 1996.
	   Critics of the government's plan to rebuild the country's
infrastructure from the devastation wrought by the 1975-90 civil
war have alleged that corruption remains rampant in the civil
service.
	   ____
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Share prices and turnover rose
substantially on the Amman Stock Exchange during the first six
months of the year, the exchange's report said Wednesday.
	   Brokers said the rise was due to dealing in shares of
profit-making commercial banks.
	   The report said the share prices index rose 10.1 percent, or
174.6 points, in comparison to the first six months of 1997.
	   The number of shares traded on the market rose by 42.3 percent
and listed deals rose by 13 percent in comparison to the same
period last year, the report said.
	   Turnover climbed by 33.9 percent in January-June 1998, reaching
182.1 million Jordanian dinars (dlrs 256.4 million) in comparison
to 136 million dinars (dlrs 191.5 million) last year.

Two Koreans arrested on charges of selling contaminated dog meat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Prosecutors arrested two men Wednesday
on charges of selling restaurants thousands of dogs that had died
of disease or had been used for medical experiments.
	   Dog meat sales are widespread in South Korea, where many people
consider canine flesh a delicacy.
	   Since 1993, Yoo Myong-jo, 46, a dog meat dealer, has supplied
restaurants in Seoul and surrounding cities with 4,800 dogs that
died of intestinal inflammations or other diseases, prosecutors
said.
	   Kim Kwon-hoi, 45, a businessman supplying pharmaceutical
companies with animals for laboratory tests, was accused of selling
860 carcasses of dogs used to test rabies vaccines since 1995, the
prosecutors added.
	   Restaurants bought the contaminated dog meat at one-fifth of
normal market prices to meet big demand in summer months, when
eating dog meat is most common, they said.
	   Yoo and Kim were charged with violating South Korea's food
hygiene laws. If convicted in court, they could face up to five
years in prison.
	   In South Korea, a superstitious belief holds that dog meat
heightens male sexual prowess.
	   Sensitive to its image, South Korea closed thousands of dog meat
restaurants in its big cities ahead of the 1988 Summer Olympics in
Seoul by invoking a law that prohibits the sale of ``foods deemed
unsightly.''
	   But it has not strictly enforced that ban since. Many
restaurants moved to back alleys, where they continued to serve dog
meat, advertising their wares as ``tonic soups'' or ``bow-wow
soups.''
	   European animal rights groups have threatened to boycott Korean
goods and disrupt the country's role as co-host of the 2002 World
Cup soccer finals if it continues to allow dog meat sales.

Yugoslavia mines its border with Macedonia

 &UR; Eds: SUBS to correct Jezice to Jazince in graf 3. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Yugoslavia has planted mines along its
border with Macedonia in Kosovo province, apparently to prevent
Albanian militants from crossing illegally and smuggling arms,
media and foreign observers reported Wednesday.
	   ``We have spotted the mines and we asked Belgrade and Skopje for
clarification,'' said Marc McEvoy, a spokesman for the U.N.
peacekeeping force in Macedonia.
	   The Macedonian media said the antipersonnel mines, which are
banned by some international conventions, have been placed at two
spots near Jazince, one of the main border crossings, on the
Yugoslav side of the border.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, run by Kosovo Albanian
leadership, said ethnic Albanians in the border town of General
Jankovic have also been warned about the presence of Serb-laid
mines.
	   With violence raging in Serbia's troubled Kosovo province, there
are increased fears the clashes could spill across the border into
Macedonia, which has its own substantial and restive ethnic
Albanian minority. The republics of Serbia and Montenegro make up
Yugoslavia.
	   The threat of a broader Balkan conflict prompted the U.N.
Security Council in July to authorize an additional 300 troops to
the 750-strong U.N. peacekeeping force already in Macedonia and
extend the force's mandate until the end of next February.
	   More than 400 people have been killed in Kosovo since the Serb
crackdown against Kosovo's Albanian separatists began in February.

Rights activist says 11 mass graves found in Indonesian province

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A human rights group said Wednesday it
had found 11 mass graves, possibly containing hundreds of bodies of
people allegedly killed by Indonesian troops in the troubled
northernmost province of Aceh.
	   Rufriadi, a lawyer at the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation in the
provincial capital of Banda Aceh, said he and another human rights
activist found the graves in four remote locations on the northern
tip of Sumatra Island last month.
	   He estimated that each burial site could contain as many 50
bodies and that other burial sites might also exist.
	   ``There are at least eight mass graves in villages in North Aceh
regency, and one each in Central Aceh, East Aceh and Pidie
regencies,'' Rufriadi said.
	   One of the sites was nicknamed ``Skull Hill'' by local people.
	   There was no immediate comment from the military.
	   However, a parliamentary team that went to the province last
week to investigate allegations of human rights abuses denied
earlier local media reports that it had found evidence of mass
graves.
	   The Indonesian military has long been accused of arbitrary
killing and torture in Aceh, a strongly Muslim province about 1,750
kilometers (1,100 miles) northwest of Jakarta.
	   Some human rights groups claim thousands of people have been
killed there since a separatist rebellion started in the late
1980s.
	   The province has endured rebellions for generations dating back
to Dutch colonial times several centuries ago.
	   In a telephone interview, Rufriadi told The Associated Press
that local villagers had shown him the mass grave sites.
	   They alleged elite Indonesian troops had shot the victims.
	   ``They include villagers who claimed to have been forced to bury
the dead bodies under gunpoint,'' Rufriadi said. ``They all say
that it was the work of the military.''
	   Besides the mass graves, Rufriadi said he had located a
traditional village house that local people alleged had been used
as a torture center by troops.
	   Allegations of mass graves follow a separate investigation into
accusations that elite troops kidnapped dozens of anti-government
activists in the weeks before authoritarian former President
Suharto stepped down in May.
	   Aceh, one of three Indonesian provinces where rebels are
fighting for independent states, was put under the status of
Military Operation Region in 1991.
	   The other two provinces are Irian Jaya in the western part of
New Guinea and the former Portuguese colony of East Timor.
	   Meanwhile, a Jakarta hospital plans a post mortem examination of
three bodies found buried on a beach on an island off the capital,
a human rights activist said.
	   Munir, who chairs the Commission of Disappeared People and the
Victims of Violence, said the three bodies were found by local
residents two weeks ago.
	   Munir feared the bodies were those of missing anti-government
activists.
	   He said the badly decayed corpses were found with watches,
wallets and name cards, but had not been positively identified.

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ The 1998 Gay Games were supposed
to be a carefree celebration of homosexuality.
	   But even before the hoopla of the opening ceremony could fade,
the director was fired for mismanagement, prompting the city of
Amsterdam to rush to the rescue with a dlrs 2.5 million loan to
ensure the Games go on.
	   ``Gay Games Committee Gets More Surprises Every Day,'' a
headline in Wednesday's daily De Volkskrant said, summing up the
confusion swirling around the quadrennial Olympics-style sports
festival.
	   ``It's kind of a dark spot on the party. It's a shame,'' said
Rudolf Steinberger, who helped organize the marathon competition.
	   It wasn't supposed to be like this.
	   Fifteen thousand athletes and 200,000-plus spectators have
flocked to Amsterdam, Europe's self-styled homosexual capital, for
some summer fun and sports.
	   But Sunday's firing of Games managing director Marc Janssens _
and the discovery of a trail of unauthorized overspending behind
him _ have overshadowed the 14-million-guilder (dlrs 7 million)
event, which began Aug. 1 and runs through Saturday.
	   Janssens, a Dutchman, was fired by the Games board of directors,
who said he ``made commitments outside the approved budget,
commitments that were also bigger than his authority.''
	   Despite more than 6 million guilders (dlrs 3 million) in
government subsidies and sponsorship money, as well as ticket sales
and merchandise revenues, the games were about 2 million guilders
(dlrs 1 million) short.
	   ``The problems were severe,'' said City Hall spokeswoman Mirjam
Otten. ``It is important for the Games to go on.''
	   To make sure they do, Amsterdam officials put up a bank
guarantee of 5 million guilders (dlrs 2.5 million) this week. KLM
Royal Dutch Airlines, a prominent Games sponsor that already had
donated 500,000 guilders (dlrs 250,000), doled out another 225,000
guilders (dlrs 112,500).
	   City officials, wary of any more misspending, have appointed
accountants to keep an eye on the books and make sure
belt-tightening is encouraged.
	   ``The situation is under control ... you can be sure that we're
not big spenders at this moment,'' said Games spokesman Paul van
Yperen as he headed for the bodybuilding arena, where dozens of
competitors were strutting their bulk.
	   Although some 30 sporting competitions and other cultural events
are offered at these Games, they have been largely eclipsed by the
financial troubles.
	   ``The 15,000 participants have trained hard for the year and put
a lot of money in what should become the experience of their
lives,'' Volkskrant said in an editorial Wednesday.
	   ``Let's hope that they will be protected from new blunders from
the organizers during the rest of the Games.''

Floods in Iran kill 41 people and leave 33 missing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Flash floods have killed at least 41 people
in Iran this week, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported Wednesday. Another 33 people are missing.
	   Following heavy rains, the floods washed through the town of
Masouleh in the northern province of Gilan, destroying bridges and
houses and killing livestock. Twenty-nine people drowned, 30 went
missing and 18 were injured, the agency said.
	   In the northwestern province of Ardebil province, five people
drowned and three disappeared in floods that devastated farms,
homes and roads.
	   Four people were killed and four injured in West Azerbaijan
province, while in East Azerbaijan one person drowned in the
floods, the agency said.
	   The floods also hit 19 villages in the northern province of
Mazandaran, damaging 120 houses, schools and clinics.
	   Two people drowned in the western province of Hamedan.
	   The agency reported that rescue operations were under way in the
stricken areas.
	   Iran regularly suffers earthquakes, floods and landslides. On
Saturday, landslides triggered by heavy rains killed at least 32
people and injured 45 others in Gilan and Ardebil provinces.

Manchester United boss slams Kluivert over transfer talks

 &UR; EDS: REPEATING to CORRECT typo in slug. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Manchester United manager Alex
Ferguson, angered after Patrick Kluivert rejected a 9 million pound
(dlrs 14.63 million) move to Old Trafford, said he was duped into
believing the Dutch World Cup star wanted to join the team.
	   The 22-year-old striker turned down the offer from Manchester
United and elected to stay with Italian club AC Milan. He has not
ruled out a future move to Arsenal to join with Dutch stars Dennis
Bergkamp and Marc Overmars.
	   Ferguson was critical of Kluivert's conduct during negotiations
and said the Dutch forward failed to realize the scale of the
opportunity he had turned down.
	   ``Maybe he doesn't know how big Manchester United is,'' Ferguson
said. ``I am very surprised he has not given himself the
opportunity to speak to us.
	   ``Now we hear that he wants to go to London. If that is where he
wants to live there is nothing we can do about it.''
	   Ferguson said his failure to sign Kluivert had made him more
determined to lure Trinidadian striker Dwight Yorke _ his other
priority target this season _ from Aston Villa.

Former East German agent tried for 1956 kidnapping in West Berlin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A former East German agent who went on trial
Wednesday in the 1956 kidnapping of an alleged U.S. spy in West
Berlin said the man was wanted on espionage charges, and was simply
being brought to justice.
	   Harry Mittenzwei, 67, testified in Berlin state court that
Werner Chrobock was suspected of recruiting spies for the United
States in East Berlin in the 1950s, but then fled to West Berlin in
1955.
	   East German spy masters wanted him stopped, and ordered his
kidnapping so that he could be tried in East Germany, Mittenzwei
testified.
	   Mittenzwei faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted of
depriving Chrobock of his freedom.
	   Mittenzwei said he organized Chrobock's kidnapping by having
other agents of the East German secret police, or Stasi, befriend
the suspected U.S. agent in bars in West Germany. The agents later
drove him across the border into East Berlin in 1956.
	   Chrobock was convicted of espionage in East Germany and served
seven years of a 15-year prison term.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ With the economy mired in recession, Hong Kong
flag carrier Cathay Pacific Airways on Wednesday reported its first
loss ever, and said it would inevitably result in further layoffs.
	   The airline reported a net loss of 175 million Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 22.4 million) for 1998's first half, compared with a
profit of 1.07 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 137 million) in
January-June last year.
	   Chairman Peter Sutch told reporters that the loss ``would
inevitably result'' in a reduction of overall staff.
	   ``I have no idea when the environment will become better,''
Television Broadcast quoted Sutch as saying.
	   With unemployment already at a 15-year high and tourism off by
20 percent, the airline announced in late May that it would cut
staff by as much as 7 percent, or 1,000 jobs, within the year, in
addition to the 870 layoffs at the beginning of 1998.
	   Cargo handling problems at Hong Kong's new international
airport, which prompted a temporary embargo on cargo, compounded
the airline's difficulties. Cathay Pacific said lost revenue due to
the embargo totaled 250 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 32
million) in July alone.
	   ``Cargo levels held up relatively well for the first three
months of the year, before they too succumbed to the economic
slowdown,'' it said in a statement.
	   The overall passenger load in 1998's first half fell to 66.5
percent from 71.2 percent last year due to the Asian financial
crisis, which has kept many tourists at home, the statement added.
	   Passenger load for Europe stood at 74.5 percent in the first
half, down from 77.3 percent in January-June last year, while the
load from North Asia fell to 60.1 percent from 65.1 percent.
	   Despite the airline's troubles, Sutch said it still would accept
delivery of aircraft it has already ordered.
	   While Asian tourists have dwindled, ``demand for long-haul
flights to Europe and North America remains reasonably strong,'' he
said.
	   The Hong Kong dollar is making the territory virtually
unaffordable for many tourists. The currency, which is linked to
the U.S. dollar, is the only convertible Asian currency not to have
been devalued since the onset of the region's financial storm last
year. Other currencies have lost 50 to 80 percent of their value.

Institute: Germany's unemployed to remain above 4 million into
</HEADLINE>
1999 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ An independent economic institute on
Wednesday threw cold water on Chancellor Helmut Kohl's optimistic
forecast that unemployment will dip below the psychologically
significant 4 million mark this fall.
	   The Munich-based German Institute for Economic Research said the
number of jobless will remain around 4.3 million, or 11.2 percent,
through 1998, and isn't expected to decline to 4 million until the
end of 1999.
	   Germany's double-digit unemployment has been a key issue in fall
elections, and Kohl has been counting on improvements in the
sluggish German economy to propel him to a record fifth term.
	   During an interview Tuesday from his Austrian vacation retreat,
Kohl said he expected unemployment to dip below 4 million in the
fall, and remain below that level all next year.
	   Kohl has pointed to recent declines in the jobless rate _ to
10.5 percent in June _ as evidence that his policies are working
and a turnaround is underway.
	   Kohl has been trailing the opposition Social Democrats, who
accuse him of not doing enough to put Germans back to work.
	   The institute's report acknowledges an economy recovery,
predicting 2.7 percent growth in 1998 thanks to domestic demand for
goods and investment. The report noted ``dynamic development'' in
sectors such as machine tools, transport vehicles, and electronic
investment goods.
	   Higher tax returns on the back of rising growth will help bring
Germany's 1998 deficit-to-GDP ratio down to 2.3 percent in 1998 and
1.4 percent in 1999, the report said, well within the 3 percent
criteria set for the single European currency.
	   Separately, the institute reiterated its prognosis that the
Asian financial crisis won't significantly hamper the economic
recovery underway in Germany and western Europe.

Pakistani newspapers, officials paint India in worst light
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistanis read in their newspapers
Wednesday that the government in their huge, nuclear and hostile
neighbor India had massacred its own citizens in disputed Kashmir.
	   The front-page report in The News, published in the three main
Pakistani cities of Islamabad, Karachi and Lahore, bore little
resemblance to Indian accounts of a shooting earlier in the week in
Indian-held Kashmir, and illustrated the gulf in perceptions
separating India and Pakistan.
	   While Indian police said a feud between two groups of Muslim
separatist guerrillas resulted in the 19 deaths, The News, citing
unnamed sources in India, stated baldly that ``19 innocent
Kashmiris ... were massacred by Indian forces.'' The Islamabad
newspaper The Muslim carried a similar report.
	   Religious differences between majority Muslim Pakistan and
predominately Hindu India have fueled animosity, as has the
long-standing dispute over Kashmir, the Himalayan territory divided
between them. India and Pakistan have fought three wars, two over
Kashmir, since each gained independence from Britain in 1947.
	   ``We feel that both governments are prisoners of their own
propaganda,'' said I.A. Rehman, who is active in a peace group
dedicated to bringing ordinary Indians and Pakistanis together for
talks.
	   Rehman, who is also director of the independent Human Rights
Commission of Pakistan, said the peace group's Pakistan chapter had
only a few hundred members in a country of 140 million. But he said
interest was growing.
	   ``I'm not predicting change tomorrow, because the prejudices
acquired over decades take time to get rid of,'' he said. ``The
government propaganda ... has taken root in the public mind. But
the futility of warmongering is becoming clear to more and more
Pakistanis.''
	   Recent nuclear weapons tests by both countries have added
urgency to attempts to normalize relations. But peace talks last
month between the prime ministers of India and Pakistan collapsed
amid name calling.
	   Earlier this week, the Pakistani cabinet minister in charge of
Kashmiri policy told reporters Indian officials were ``heartless''
enough to kill Hindus and blame Muslim militants in order to
discredit the separatist movement. Minister Majeed Malik was
talking of three attacks in Indian-held Kashmir blamed on militants
that killed a total of 20 Hindus.
	   ``This is definitely the handiwork of people who want to
discredit mujahedeen,'' Malik said, using the Arabic term for
Muslim freedom fighters.
	   For the past week, India and Pakistan have traded charges the
other was heartlessly training its guns on Kashmiri civilians.
Cross-border military firing in Kashmir, which continued Wednesday,
has left a total of nearly 100 people dead, most of them Indian and
Pakistani villagers.

Japan's Cabinet approves key bills for cleaning up bad loans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Cabinet on Wednesday approved two bills
designed to clean up bad loans in the country's debt-ridden banking
system.
	   One bill would allow the government to take over insolvent banks
and keep them running for up to five years while bad loans and
remaining assets are sold.
	   The so-called ``bridge bank'' plan would be funded by up to 11
trillion yen (dlrs 76 billion) in public funds.
	   The bill is designed to prevent the failure of a bank from
hurting its healthy customers by allowing its government-appointed
managers to continue making loans to sound borrowers.
	   Japanese financial institutions are suffocating under problem
loans estimated at more than 80 trillion yen (dlrs 556 billion),
mostly left over from the collapse of the real estate market in the
early 1990s.
	   The second bill would create a special mediator under the Prime
Minister's Office to resolve conflicting claims on properties used
as collateral for bad loans. The difficulty of untangling such
claims has been a major obstacle to resolving the bad debt problem.
	   The bills, along with other legislation to clean up the
financial system, were submitted to Parliament later Wednesday.
	   Although the government aims to pass the bills in the current
session of Parliament that ends in October, the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party's defeat in last month's upper house elections
means it may struggle to obtain the necessary legislative support.
	   The opposition Democratic Party has already criticized the bill
for not clearly defining when a bank should be considered insolvent
and for not including punitive measures for negligent managers.
	   Finance Ministry officials responded that the government's
Financial Supervisory Agency will have the power to decide when a
bank has failed if it is in danger of suspending deposit
repayments, or if it is operating ``inappropriately.''
	   Also Wednesday, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the
government was willing to deal ``flexibly'' with the opposition on
the banking bills.
	   Yuji Tsushima, a senior Liberal Democrat who belongs to Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi's party faction, said: ``A good confrontation
in the upper house will result in a better bridge bank plan.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Dozens of ethnic Albanians have been
buried at a garbage dump later leveled by bulldozers after Serb
forces overran a separatist stronghold in Kosovo last month,
Associated Press Television reported Wednesday.
	   The village of Orahovac, 50 kilometers (31 miles) southwest of
Pristina, was the scene of fierce battles in July between Serb
forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army fighting for independence for
Kosovo.
	   At least 60 civilians were killed in five days of fighting in
Orahovac, which fell into Serb hands on July 20, according to the
Pristina-based Committee for the Protection of Human Rights.
	   At a garbage dump about one kilometer (half-mile) outside
Orahovac, an AP-TV crew saw about 50 small mounds of earth, marked
with sticks, some of them bearing ethnic Albanian names, others
just numbers.
	   A small bulldozer which apparently leveled the terrain was still
at the site Wednesday.
	   The ethnic Albanian Koha Ditore daily reported earlier that ``at
least 36'' fresh graves had been discovered near Orahovac on
Tuesday.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Laurent Kabila's government on Wednesday
accused neighboring Rwanda of sending troops across its borders
into eastern Congo, where ethnic Tutsi rebels reportedly captured
two major towns.
	   Fighting was reported on Tuesday in Bukavu near the border with
Rwanda and in the village of Kitona on the opposite side of Congo
near the Atlantic coastline.
	   It was unclear whether the fighting continued through Wednesday,
but Rwanda's state-run radio reported that rebels had captured
Bukavu and Goma, the two biggest towns in Congo's troubled eastern
Kivu region.
	   ``Almost 400 army forces have come from Rwanda and have caused
Congolese bloodshed,'' Congolese government spokesman Didier
Mumengi said.
	   The report, which gave no details, could not be independently
confirmed.
	   Mumengi also said there was heavy fighting in the western
village of Kitona on Tuesday, but refused to elaborate on who was
in control of the town or its military base.
	   That battle began after rebel gunmen forced an airplane they had
hijacked to land in Kitona, about 225 kilometers (140 miles)
southwest of the capital, Kinshasa. The hijackers were believed to
be Banyamulenge ethnic fighters in the eastern city of Goma.
	   The rebellion began about a week after Kabila ordered all
Rwandan troops out of the country. He did not explain the move.
	   A Rwandan official, who asked not to be further identified, said
Bizima Karaha, an ethnic Tutsi and Congo's foreign minister had
arrived in Goma, apparently to take up sides with the rebels.
	   Karaha did not return to Kinshasa from South Africa as scheduled
earlier this week, giving rise to speculation that he may have
sought political asylum in South Africa.
	   Rwanda, Burundi and Zambia have closed their borders with Congo
while France and the United States have warned their citizens not
to travel there.

Norway to send diplomat to Myanmar to meet Aung San Suu Kyi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway will send a diplomat to Myanmar to
see democracy activist Aung San Suu Kyi and to deliver a protest to
the country's military leadership.
	   ``We understand that Aung San Suu Kyi is ill and we have not
been able to get in contact with her. Because we are worried we
have decided to send our charge d'affaires in Singapore to
Rangoon,'' Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek was quoted as telling
the Aftenposten newspaper Wednesday.
	   In cooperation with the United States, the EU and other
countries that Norway cooperates with regarding Myanmar _ also
known as Burma _ the envoy will also try to organize a joint
diplomatic protest at the foreign ministry against the military
regime's treatment of the opposition.
	   ``The fact that we now are sending a diplomat to Burma is mostly
an expression of solidarity with the opposition, but it is also a
signal to the authorities that we are keeping a close look-out,''
Vollebaek said, according to the newspaper.
	   Aung San Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner, was
recently forced by the military to return to the capital after
having spent six days in her car when she was denied permission to
visit supporters in another town.
	   Norway has already sent a formal protest to the military junta
against this incident, but Vollebaek says the situation has gotten
worse.
	   Because of the deteriorating situation he has also decided to
give an extra million dollars to the Norwegian Burma Council and
other organizations that work in support of the oppostion forces.
This year Norway has already given 1,27 million dollars to refugee
work and the opposition.

	   The decision by the rubber stamp Parliament needs to be approved
by the Revolutionary Command Council, the most powerful
decision-making body in the country.
	   Still, the Parliament is unlikely to have made such an important
decision without Saddam's prior approval. The Parliament's vote
paves the way for a ban on cooperation with the inspectors but
leaves the final decision on when and whether to implement it with
Saddam.
	   A Parliament statement issued at the end of its six-hour session
said: ``The National Assembly calls for stopping cooperation'' with
the United Nations Special Commission, which is charged with
overseeing the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   The statement also called on the U.N. Security Council to lift
the sanctions, which were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
	   However, the sanctions cannot be lifted until UNSCOM announces
that Iraq's is free of illegal weapons.
	   The statement said the lawmakers recommended severing of
relations with the weapons inspectors believing that UNSCOM will
never give Iraq a clean bill of health on its weaponry.
	   During the Parliament sessions, lawmakers pledged full support
for any measures Saddam takes and urged him to ``firmly carry out''
their recommendation.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Strongman Hun Sen's party emerged
the winner when the first complete results from Cambodia's
parliamentary election were announced Wednesday, 10 days after the
vote.
	   The results appeared to give his Cambodian People's Party a
slight majority in the National Assembly, although not the
two-thirds required by the constitution to form a government.
	   Opposition parties continued to allege widespread irregularities
and fraud in voting and vote-counting.
	   The ruling party won 41.4 percent of the popular vote, with
2,030,802 votes from 4,902,488 valid ballots cast in the July 26
election, according to the preliminary figures from the National
Election Committee.
	   ``It is happy news for us, but we will have to wait for the seat
allocation,'' said Om Yen Tieng, an adviser to Co-Prime Minister
Hun Sen. ``Although the result did not correspond 100 percent to
the sacrifice and efforts we have made, it is due to Hun Sen's
efforts and responsibility to history by calling a free and fair
election.''
	   No official announcement has been made of the allocation of
parliamentary seats, which are awarded on a province-by-province
basis. But calculations based on the vote indicate the Cambodian
People's Party will have 64 seats, the opposition FUNCINPEC party
43 and its ally, the Sam Rainsy Party, 15 in the 122-member
assembly.
	   A recount of some votes has already begun, with the final
official tally supposed to be issued between Aug. 19 and 29.
	   ``It has been and continues to be the stance of FUNCINPEC that
until the recounting is completed we cannot accept proclamation of
the results, and that's final,'' said Mu Sochua, a spokesman for
Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party.
	   ``Nothing is official until all complaints are addressed and go
through the appropriate appeals,'' said Sam Rainsy, FUNCINPEC's
ally in opposition.
	   FUNCINPEC took 31.7 percent of the popular vote, and the Sam
Rainsy Party 14.3 percent. The remainder of the vote was divided
among 36 smaller parties.
	   The opposition groups have refused to discuss Hun Sen's
invitation to join a coalition government until their complaints
have been looked into . They have threatened to boycott the new
parliamentary session if their concerns are not met.
	   Without the opposition's attendance, the assembly is unlikely to
have present the two-thirds of its 122 members needed to conduct
any major business.
	   Hun Sen has threatened to change the constitution to govern
without them, or to simply keep his current government in power.
	   Officials were slowly recounting votes from five communes
Wednesday. A handful of opposition politicians said they wanted
votes from all of the country's 1,600 communes counted again.
	   ``They have the right to request the recount of all ballots, but
for this we need a lot of time, money and people,'' said election
committee spokesman Samraing Kamsan.
	   The committee, widely seen as being stacked in favor of Hun
Sen's ruling party, has faced criticism over a number of issues.
	   Its vice chairman, Kassie Neou, said late Tuesday he had
resigned as head of the subcommittee handling recounts.
	   Kassie Neou, a respected human rights worker considered one of
the few independent voices on the committee, is known to have
privately expressed misgivings about its work. Committee spokesman
Samraing Kamsan described him Wednesday as frustrated by
administrative and management problems.
	   The committee has also been unable to put to rest concern about
its complicated formula for allocating parliamentary seats.
	   Only last week did it become generally known that its draft
formula had been slightly amended sometime before the election to
favor the party winning the most seats in any given district _ a
move some opposition members charge was illegal.
	   In practice, the change favored Hun Sen's party, providing it
with an estimated five seats more than under the old formula.
	   The election was held one year after Hun Sen ousted FUNCINPEC's
Ranariddh as his co-premier in a violent coup, shattering a tense
dual premiership formed after the U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993.
	   Hun Sen hoped the polls would win back his legitimacy in the
international arena and aid lost after his power grab.

<TEXT>
	   Hammadi's call, at a special session of the National Assembly,
came amid a new dispute with U.N. inspectors trying to determine
whether Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The Assembly, whose members virtually all support Saddam, was
called into session to consider his plan to end the sanctions.
	   The sanctions were imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990,
sparking the Gulf War. They block the country from freely exporting
its most valuable commodity _ oil _ and cannot be lifted until U.N.
inspectors certify Iraq has destroyed its chemical and biological
weapons and long-range missiles.

Belarusian president asks writers for support
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ President Alexander Lukashenko asked
Belarusian writers on Wednesday to support his rule _ pledging his
support to them in return.
	   ``Support from the state, the president, would be provided to
you on a reciprocal basis,'' Lukashenko told a gathering of members
of the Belarusian Writers' Union. ``On a reciprocal basis _ I
emphasize again.''
	   Lukashenko, an authoritarian leader, has a long history of
suppressing media and literature critical of his government.
	   Like the Soviet leaders he admires, Lukashenko also believes in
the power of literature for influencing people's views. In the
Soviet era, writers who supported the Communist Party line were
lionized and given lavish support, while those who were perceived
as enemies of the party often wound up in prison or exile.
	   ``Literature is big politics; writers are big politicians,''
Lukasenko said. ``You have a very strong weapon, and I want this
weapon to be used for the benefit on the people and our state.''
	   ``This does not mean: Write about me, praise me, and I will
support you,'' he said. ``But the poets and writers, who ... call
for killing the president _ the president of course will not
support them.''
	   Two years ago, a young Belarusian poet, Slavomir Adamovich, was
jailed for publishing a poem ``To Kill the President'' in a case
that provoked mass protests in Belarus and abroad.
	   After a year in pre-trial detention, Adamovich received a
suspended sentence under pressure from the international literary
community to free him.

Archeologists turn down Calvin Klein bid for ancient sites
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Arguing that a fashion show is not a
cultural event, archeologists snubbed Calvin Klein's request to
stage shows at two of the city's most treasured ancient sites.
	   ``Only artistic shows are allowed at the sites, and a fashion
show is not an artistic show,'' Mary Pandou, director of the
archeological sites for the Central Archeological Committee said
Wednesday.
	   Klein had applied to stage shows at two 2nd century sites: the
Roman Agora, or marketplace, and at the Herodion theater,
constructed in honor of the Roman Emperor Herod's wife Regilla.
	   ``We are looking at the possibility of staging a CK Calvin Klein
Jeans event in Greece,'' said Robert Triefus, a New York spokesman
for Klein.
	   According to Pandou, archeologists feared a fashion show could
damage prized antiquities at the Roman Agora, which has never in
the past been used for any kind of show.
	   ``You can't put a runway in the Agora,'' Pandou said.
	   Although the theater is used to stage plays, musicals and
theatrical events, archeologists said Klein's bid was not musically
or theatrically oriented. Only those types of shows are allowed at
the Herodion, they said.
	   Klein's show will still take place, even if it is not held in
the ancient sites. Triefus said staging an event is part of the
company's marketing plan.

BAGHDAD: their recommendation.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Iraq's confrontational stand was triggered by the collapse of
disarmament talks Monday between chief weapons inspector Richard
Butler and chief Iraqi negotiator, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz.
	   Butler cut short his visit and left Baghdad on Tuesday. He is
scheduled to report to the Security Council on Thursday.
	   The trouble was over Aziz' demand for an immediate certification
from Butler that Iraq is free of illegal weapons. Butler refused.
	   But Butler sought to play down the seriousness of the argument.
In a stopover in London en route to New York, Butler said he
already had told U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan by telephone
that the troubles should not be exaggerated.
	   ``I said very specifically to him that I don't think any of us
should describe this as a crisis,'' he told BBC radio.
	   Butler also said in an interview published Wednesday in the
Bahrain Tribune that the disarmament talks did not collapse. ``They
came to an early end,'' he said.
	   In London, Butler said he did not understand why Aziz cut short
the talks since he had told Aziz the inspectors were ``very close''
to certifying Iraq had destroyed its missiles and chemical weapons.
Though he added they were ``not close'' to solving the problem of
biological weapons.
	   Criticism of Iraq by Britain and the United States appeared
muted compared to past confrontations when the two countries
threatened military action.
	   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin
said Saddam had ``shot himself in the foot'' by mishandling a
chance to end economic sanctions. ``Iraq has only harmed itself,''
Rubin said.
	   Iraq's official newspapers stressed anew, meanwhile, that U.N.
weapons inspectors were cooperating in American plots against
Saddam's government by refusing to confirm that the country had
eliminated its weapons systems.
	   The daily Al-Thawra, the official paper of Saddam's ruling
party, ridiculed the idea that Iraq should be considered a threat
after the years of work by the inspectors.
	   ``After seven years of inspections, monitoring, obtaining
documents, destroying factories and ... searching presidential
sites, they say that Iraq is a threat,'' said the paper.

	   The decision by the rubber stamp Parliament needs to be approved
by the Revolutionary Command Council, the most powerful
decision-making body in the country.
	   Still, the Parliament is unlikely to have made such an important
decision without Saddam's prior approval. The Parliament's vote
paves the way for a ban on cooperation with the inspectors but
leaves the final decision on when and whether to implement it with
Saddam.
	   A Parliament statement issued at the end of its six-hour session
said: ``The National Assembly calls for stopping cooperation'' with
the U.N. Special Commission carryiong out he inspections.
	   The statement demanded the U.N. Security Council to lift the
sanctions.
	   It also said lawmakers recommended severing relations with the
weapons inspectors, whom they believed will never give Iraq a clean
bill of health on its weaponry.
	   During the Parliament sessions, lawmakers pledged full support
for any measures Saddam takes and urged him to ``firmly carry out''
their recommendation.

China steps up fight to save ancient heritage from smugglers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A stone tomb figure the size of a tank. An
emerald green ceramic tower. A Han dynasty horse statue the size of
a small pony.
	   All are priceless treasures China has recovered in a campaign to
salvage its ancient heritage from grave robbers, smugglers and
unscrupulous overseas collectors.
	   A small share of the booty looted from China's 5,000-year-old
history went on display Wednesday at the Revolutionary History
Museum in Beijing.
	   China has long sought to recover antiquities stolen over the
centuries, but the items on display are the first batch of relics
it has recovered through legal and diplomatic negotiations.
	   Among the items displayed was the head of a stone messenger from
the 960-1279 Song dynasty. Discovered in a San Francisco auction
house, it was returned to China just before President Bill Clinton
arrived for a state visit in late June.
	   Many of the relics, which date as far back as the Neolithic age,
were smuggled to Britain in 1994 and returned to China in May.
	   The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization recently began training Chinese customs and cultural
protection officials in ways to combat what appears to be a tidal
wave of cultural plunder.
	   Customs officials confiscated more than 11,200 smuggled
antiquities in 1997 and roughly a comparable number, about 6,000,
in the first half of this year, said Edmond Moukala, cultural
program officer for UNESCO in Beijing.
	   Some, like figurines, were small enough to hide in travelers'
luggage. Others, like the tank-size stone mythical beast that once
guarded a tomb in southern Jiangsu province, were moved with heavy
equipment and transported in shipping containers.
	   ``In order for an item that big to be smuggled out of the
country, the customs officials really had to have their eyes
closed,'' Moukala said.
	   A dlrs 140 million government program to protect antiquities and
salvage and protect thousands of historic sites has been hampered
by a lack of resources and a surge in thefts, particularly in the
region near the Yangtze River that is due to be flooded as part of
the massive Three Gorges Dam project.
	   The most eye-catching evidence was a bronze candelabra from the
206 B.C.-220 Han dynasty _ not on display _ which sold for dlrs 2.5
million at an Asian art auction in New York city in March.
	   It was found to have been taken from the Three Gorges, where art
dealers have congregated, encouraging both professional grave
thieves and local farmers to find items to be smuggled overseas,
experts say.
	   Local authorities are too busy coping with disastrous flooding
along the Yangtze this summer to prevent further plunder.
	   Items that are recovered are often damaged. The green porcelain
tower, which was made of smaller pieces meant to be stacked,
appeared unharmed, but the stone messenger's head had been cut from
the statue's body. The legs of the Han dynasty horse were cut off
midway so that it would fit into a crate.
	   ``Once something is damaged like that, it cannot be put into one
piece again,'' Moulaka noted.

Central bank to guarantee foreign investment in banks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's central bank will guarantee
foreign investment in troubled banks and finance companies, the
Bank of Thailand's deputy governor said Wednesday.
	   Kitti Patpongpibul told reporters that foreign investors will
have the option of selling their stake to the central bank's rescue
fund after a period of five years.
	   The enticement is aimed at encouraging foreigners to help rescue
the financial system, burdened with bad loans that helped cause the
Asian economic crisis.
	   The government is demanding that banks and finance companies
raise their registered capital and implement tougher rules on
non-performing loans.
	   Kitti, who was appointed by the Cabinet last week, said the
central bank's Financial Institutions Development Fund, the
country's bank rescue fund, will buy shares from the foreigners on
request at the prices they paid originally.
	   ``If it is longer than five years, the FIDF will not buy it,''
Kitti said. ``This is to guarantee that at least they will not lose
any of the money they plan to invest.''
	   Some foreign investors have already set repurchase by the FIDF
as a precondition before buying into troubled banks and finance
companies, Kitti said. He declined to identify any of them.
	   Due to a domestic liquidity crunch, Thai financial institutions
have turned their eyes overseas to raise new capital. But
foreigners have been reluctant because of the precarious state of
many Thai banks and finance companies.
	   The Thai government is currently negotiating with the
International Monetary Fund over its dlrs 17.2 billion economic
rescue package for the country.
	   The government is expected to spell out plans on how to deal
with banks and finance companies that cannot raise fresh capital.

Thai stock index ends at lowest level in 11 years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Thailand-Bank Investments &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's main stock index closed at
its lowest level in 11 years Wednesday despite a late rally in bank
and finance shares after the central bank announced it will
guarantee foreign investment in the troubled sector.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand index dropped 3.97 points, or 1.5
percent, closing at 254.07. It was the lowest level since April
1987, and beat the previous low this year of 257.44 on June 15.
	   Analysts said the late surge in bank and finance shares was not
enough to turn around huge index losses in the morning session on
pessimism over Thailand's deepening economic woes, which show no
sign of ending more than a year since the Asian crisis began.
	   Banking stocks ended marginally higher and the finance sector
index closed up 3.2 percent on comments by central bank officials
that the government will guarantee foreign investment in troubled
banks and finance companies.

Indonesian groups to train receivers ahead of new bankruptcy law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A newly created body plans to hold
urgent training sessions for lawyers and accountants as
crisis-ridden Indonesia prepares to enact a new bankruptcy law.
	   The Indonesian Receivers and Administrators Association,
established Wednesday, said Indonesia now has only 16 qualified
receivers and administrators.
	   Courses would be open to Indonesians, but foreign citizens would
also be permitted to become receivers and administrators if they
reside in Indonesia and are certified by the association, said an
association official, Amir Abadi Jusuf.
	   Indonesia's Parliament passed the new bankruptcy law last month.
It is scheduled to take effect Aug. 20, replacing legislation put
in place by Dutch colonizers in 1906.
	   The new law is a key policy in a government program to solve
huge corporate debt problems caused by the worst economic crisis in
30 years.
	   Hit hard by the rupiah's sharp fall against the dollar, a host
of Indonesian companies are unable to pay their debts, especially
to international lenders.
	   The government has also established a debt-restructuring agency.
	   Although the association is preparing itself for a rash of
bankruptcy petitions, the rupiah's weakness against the dollar is
expected to discourage some foreign creditors from rushing in.
	   ``Lenders may reckon that the value of the proceeds raised from
the sale of bankrupt companies' assets will fall much below the
amount of their loans if converted into dollars,'' Jusuf said.

BAGHDAD: their recommendation.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Iraq's confrontational stand was triggered by the collapse of
disarmament talks Monday between chief weapons inspector Richard
Butler and chief Iraqi negotiator, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz.
	   Butler cut short his visit and left Baghdad on Tuesday. He is
scheduled to report to the Security Council on Thursday.
	   The trouble was over Aziz' demand for an immediate certification
from Butler that Iraq is free of illegal weapons. Butler refused.
	   But Butler sought to play down the seriousness of the argument.
In a stopover in London en route to New York, Butler said he
already had told U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan by telephone
that the troubles should not be exaggerated.
	   ``I said very specifically to him that I don't think any of us
should describe this as a crisis,'' he told BBC radio.
	   Butler also said in an interview published Wednesday in the
Bahrain Tribune that the disarmament talks did not collapse. ``They
came to an early end,'' he said.
	   In London, Butler said he did not understand why Aziz cut short
the talks since he had told Aziz the inspectors were ``very close''
to certifying Iraq had destroyed its missiles and chemical weapons.
Though he added they were ``not close'' to solving the problem of
biological weapons.
	   Criticism of Iraq by Britain and the United States appeared
muted compared to past confrontations when the two countries
threatened military action.
	   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin
said Saddam had ``shot himself in the foot'' by mishandling a
chance to end economic sanctions. ``Iraq has only harmed itself,''
Rubin said.
	   Iraq's official newspapers stressed anew, meanwhile, that U.N.
weapons inspectors were cooperating in American plots against
Saddam's government by refusing to confirm that the country had
eliminated its weapons systems.
	   The daily Al-Thawra, the official paper of Saddam's ruling
party, ridiculed the idea that Iraq should be considered a threat
after the years of work by the inspectors.
	   ``After seven years of inspections, monitoring, obtaining
documents, destroying factories and ... searching presidential
sites, they say that Iraq is a threat,'' said the paper.

226 foreigners blocked from entering the Philippines in July
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Immigration officers stopped 226
foreigners from entering the Philippines last month, an official
said Wednesday.
	   Immigration chief Rufus Rodriguez said the July figure was eight
times higher than in June, when 28 foreigners were turned back. He
said 183 of the foreigners had spurious documents, 26 had no entry
visas and 17 were included in a government watch list.
	   Rodriguez said the rejections were part of an intensified
campaign to prevent international terrorists, drug traffickers,
pedophiles and criminal fugitives from entering.
	   He said that during the same period, 467 Filipinos were
prevented from taking flights out of the country after they were
found to be carrying tampered passports or fake travel papers.
	   Most of the rejected Filipinos were stopped on suspicion they
were going overseas not as tourists but as illegal workers,
Rodriguez said.

Donald fined for criticizing umpire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LEEDS, England (AP) _ South African fast bowler Allan Donald was
fined 546 pounds (dlrs 874) and was handed a suspended one-match
ban for criticizing Mervyn Kitchen's umpiring performance in the
fourth cricket test.
	   Donald was found guilty of breaching the International Cricket
Council's code of conduct by match referee Ahmed Ebrahim during a
15-minute hearing at Headingley on Wednesday.
	   The fine represents 50 percent of his match fee, while the one
match ban was suspended over 12 months.
	   Kitchen made contentious decisions during England's eight-wicket
win at Trent Bridge and was later reported saying that match could
have been his last at test level.
	   Following the fourth test, Donald told BBC radio that Kitchen
had a couple of ``shockers'' _ refering to two questionable
umpiring decisions.
	   ``I think Merv has realized that he had a few shockers....well,
a few shocking decisions that he did make in that Test match which
swung it,'' he said.
	   ``These kind of things are pressure beyond belief _ he just
looked to me like he was struggling.
	   ``For a man to admit that he has made some bad mistakes and then
say that maybe he should hang up the boots...if it comes from the
heart he must really mean it.
	   ``If you lose your concentration you're messing with people's
careers. One decision in the heat of the moment can swing a game.''
	   Ebrahim said Donald's actions were serious but he deserved a
``second chance'' because it was his first serious breach of
conduct and he had made a public apology.
	   During the match, Donald vented his frustration at umpiring
decisions at the English batsman _ particularly Mike Atherton _ in
a barrage of fast, short-pitched bowling which added some venom to
the series.
	   Atherton survived and went on to score an unbeaten 98 as he
steered England to victory, but Donald has vowed to get even with
the former England skipper in the fifth and deciding test at
Headingley.
	   Earlier in series, England batsman Mark Ramprakash was fined 25
per cent of his match fee and was given a one match ban, suspended
over six months, for questioning an umpire's decision in the second
test at Lord's.

Singapore attacks Amnesty International report on political trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore attacked a report from Amnesty
International on Wednesday, describing the human rights
organization's criticism of a recent political trial as a
denigration of the judiciary.
	   Amnesty had criticized a decision last month by Singapore's
highest court to vastly increase the amount of damages awarded to
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong in a closely watched defamation case
against veteran opposition party leader J.B. Jeyaretnam.
	   Jeyaretnam said he is unable to pay the 250,000 Singapore
dollars (dlrs 145,350) in damages and costs in the case stemming
from a campaign speech. If he is made bankrupt, he will lose his
Parliament seat, one of three opposition seats in the 84-member
legislature dominated by the People's Action Party since
independence.
	   ``Amnesty's latest statement contains inaccurate and
unsubstantiated assertions of law and facts,'' said a statement
from the Ministry of Law. ``It disregards the carefully reasoned
judgment of the Court of Appeal, in order to denigrate the
integrity and competence of the Singapore judiciary.''
	   The tangled civil case centered on Jeyaretnam's final campaign
rally statement in 1996, in which he mentioned that a fellow
Workers Party candidate had filed police complaints against ``Goh
and his people.''
	   The statement was true. Under Singapore law, Goh successfully
sued Jeyaretnam, and was originally awarded 20,000 Singapore
dollars (dlrs 11,600) in damages. Both parties appealed the
verdict.
	   On July 17, the Court of Appeal quintupled the damages, ruling
that Jeyaretnam had acted ``in malice.'' He was also ordered to pay
all court costs, estimated at 150,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs
87,200).
	   The Amnesty report said it was ``concerned about the wider
implications of the fact that no (People's Action Party) politician
has ever lost a defamation suit in Singapore, and that an
examination of the overall pattern of defamation awards appears to
show a marked disparity in cases involving members of the
government versus private citizens.''
	   The Law Ministry responded that government ministers are
entitled to higher damages because of their ``reputation and
standing.'' The ministry statement set out a point-by-point
rebuttal of the Amnesty report on the judicial case, calling it an
attempt ``to pressure and intimidate the Singapore government.''
	   The defamation case was mentioned in this year's U.S. State
Department Human Rights Report as an example of the Singapore
government using libel and defamation suits to stifle freedom of
speech and intimidate the political opposition.

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Forces opposed to the ruling Taliban
religious militia claimed a victory Wednesday in fighting in
eastern Afghanistan, while the two front lines just outside the
northern opposition stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif were reported calm
Wednesday.
	   Abdullah, a spokesman for anti-Taliban alliance leader Ahmed
Shah Masood, said Masood's troops captured 25 Taliban bunkers after
a successful offensive east of Kunduz province, several hundred
kilometers (miles) east of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   The alliance is backed into a small corner of northern
Afghanistan. With Mazar-e-Sharif in its sights, the Taliban appear
poised to capture all of the country.
	   Taliban leaders have imposed a strict version of Islamic law in
territory they control. Since capturing the Afghan capital, Kabul,
in 1996, Taliban officials have barred girls from school and
confined most women to their homes.
	   The anti-Taliban alliance is made up mostly of Afghanistan's
religious and ethnic minorities.
	   Fifty Taliban soldiers were killed and 112 captured in
Wednesday's eastern fighting, Abdullah said, making no mention of
alliance casualties. Taliban officials could not immediately be
reached for comment on Abdullah's report.
	   Earlier, Taliban officials reported no fighting around
Mazar-e-Sharif. Taliban fighters are reportedly closing in on the
city on two sides, with the front lines about 20 kilometers (12
miles) to the west and 40 kilometers (25 miles) to the east.
	   Tuesday, Taliban spokesman Abdul Hay Muttayn said the religious
militia was pausing to build bunkers and take other measures to
shore up defenses around Mazar-e-Sharif. It was unclear when it
would attempt to capture the city.
	   Their hesitancy comes after a brutal defeat last May, when the
Taliban retreated from Mazar-e-Sharif after street battles in which
hundreds of Taliban soldiers died. As many as 2,000 Taliban
prisoners of war reportedly were later massacred.
	   ``We will once again beat the Taliban in the north,'' said
Masood spokesman Abdullah, who like many Afghans uses one name
only.
	   Abdullah spoke by telephone from London, from where he said he
had been in touch with Masood in northern Afghanistan.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Wall Street's big drop rattled investor sentiment
around the world, sending share prices lower from Asia to Europe on
Wednesday before the New York Stock Exchange opened to yet another
sell-off.
	   ``It is unpleasant and nasty _ a white-knuckle ride,'' said
Jeremy Batstone, an analyst at Natwest Stockbrokers in London.
	   Blue-chip prices were more than 2 percent lower on the London
Stock Exchange, Europe's biggest market, with similar red ink
showing up across trading screens in other key exchanges, including
Frankfurt, Paris and Milan.
	   Some analysts urged shareholders not to panic _ but all eyes
were on Wall Street's opening, and it provided little immediate
reassurances.
	   The New York Stock Exchange began trading with the Dow quickly
gaining about 20 points before reversing course in just minutes and
showing a 50-point decline.
	   Big losses on the NYSE, where the Dow fell nearly 300 points on
Tuesday, sent shudders through smaller markets around the globe.

Iraqi Parliament calls for end to cooperation with U.N. inspectors

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's Parliament on Wednesday called for
an immediate end to cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors to
protest against the eight-year-old economic sanctions on the
country.
	   The 250-member National Assembly unanimously adopted a
resolution urging President Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi leaders
to act on the recommendation by Parliament Speaker Sadoun Hammadi.
	   The Parliament's vote paves the way for a ban on cooperation
with the inspectors but leaves the final decision on when and
whether to implement it with Saddam.
	   Still, the rubber stamp Parliament is unlikely to have made such
an important decision without Saddam's prior approval. In the next
formality, the vote will have to be approved by the Revolutionary
Command Council, the most powerful decision-making body in Iraq.
	   A statement issued at the end of a six-hour Parliament session
said: ``The National Assembly calls for stopping cooperation'' with
the United Nations Special Commission, which is charged with
overseeing the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   The statement also called on the U.N. Security Council to lift
the sanctions, which were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait and ban the free sale of oil, the country's economic
mainstay.
	   However, the sanctions can only be lifted when UNSCOM announces
that Iraq's is free of illegal weapons.
	   Since UNSCOM does not appear ready to give that certification
there is no point in cooperating with it, the Parliament statement
said.
	   It said lawmakers pledged full support for any measures Saddam
takes and urged him to ``firmly carry out'' their recommendation
and any other steps he feels necessary.
	   On Tuesday, Saddam approved a series of undisclosed measures to
fight the sanctions. The National Assembly was also discussing
those steps. It was not clear if the non-cooperation with the U.N.
was one of them.
	   Non-cooperation implies that Iraqi officials could block the
inspectors from visiting suspected weapons sites or withold
information and documents.
	   The confrontation was triggered by the collapse of disarmament
talks Monday between chief weapons inspector Richard Butler and
chief Iraqi negotiator, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.
	   Butler cut short his visit and left Baghdad on Tuesday. He is
scheduled to report to the Security Council on Thursday.
	   The impasse was over Aziz' demand for an immediate certification
from UNSCOM that Iraq is free of illegal weapons, which Butler
refused.
	   But Butler sought to play down the seriousness of the argument.
In a stopover in London en route to New York, Butler said he
already had told U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan by telephone
that the troubles should not be exaggerated.
	   ``I said very specifically to him that I don't think any of us
should describe this as a crisis,'' he told BBC radio.
	   Butler said he did not understand why Aziz cut short the talks
since he had told Aziz the inspectors were ``very close'' to
certifying Iraq had destroyed its missiles and chemical weapons.
Though he added they were ``not close'' to solving the problem of
biological weapons.
	   Criticism of Iraq by Britain and the United States appeared
muted compared to past confrontations when the two countries
threatened military action.
	   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin
said Saddam had ``shot himself in the foot'' by mishandling a
chance to end economic sanctions. ``Iraq has only harmed itself,''
Rubin said.
	   Iraq's official newspapers stressed anew, meanwhile, that U.N.
weapons inspectors were cooperating in American plots against
Saddam's government by refusing to confirm that the country had
eliminated its weapons systems.
	   The daily Al-Thawra, the official paper of Saddam's ruling
party, ridiculed the idea that Iraq should be considered a threat
after the years of work by the inspectors.
	   ``After seven years of inspections, monitoring, obtaining
documents, destroying factories and ... searching presidential
sites, they say that Iraq is a threat,'' said the paper.

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Rescuers recovered four bodies Wednesday from a
Berlin apartment building demolished a day earlier by a suspected
natural gas explosion.
	   Hundreds of police and firefighters working with dogs, heat and
sound sensors searched for three residents still missing. Workers
used a crane, bulldozer and other heavy equipment to dig through
the rubble.
	   Hopes were raised that rescuers would find 13-year-old Sven
Tornow alive after his small, white dog was recovered unharmed
earlier Wednesday. However, his was one of the four bodies
recovered, along with two elderly women and a 70-year-old man.
	   The boy was home alone when the early morning blast collapsed
the four-story apartment building, ripping it off its foundation
and sending a huge cloud of dust over the Steglitz neighborhood.
	   His father was at work and his mother already in a new apartment
that the family planned to move into on Friday.
	   The two elderly women whose bodies were found have not yet been
identified.
	   Fire chief Alfred Broemme blamed natural gas for the explosion.
However, police were still investigating the cause.

Biggest post-Communist smuggling trial opens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The trial opened Wednesday in the
biggest post-Communist case of official smuggling, involving dlrs 1
million of contraband cigarettes.
	   Media voiced fears that military prosecutors might want to hush
up the case _ concentrating their investigations on lower-ranking
officials and leaving alone people close to President Emil
Constantinescu.
	   Some 19 officials including security officers close to
Constantinescu were arrested after the April smuggling scandal.
Only three remain in jail.
	   As the trial opened in a military court, defense attorneys asked
the judge to free all the suspects and to postpone to the trial
until September. Prosecutors asked for the rearrest of all
suspects.
	   Both requests were turned down. The judge invoked a Supreme
Court decision to keep the situation as it was.
	   In the early hours of April 16, 1998, a Ukrainian IL-76 aircraft
operated by Bulgarian company Air Sofia and loaded with 3,000
crates of cigarettes landed at a military part of Otopeni Airport.
The plane crew didn't declare the charge and the airport commander
did not log the landing.
	   Security service officers were arrested, and the chief of an
elite security service was dismissed. The head of the military
Otopeni Airport was also arrested.
	   In the early days of the investigation, prosecutors said the
case might lead to people ``all way up the state hierarchy,'' but
this has apparently not been the case.

<TEXT>
	   GISENYI, Rwanda (AP) _ Government-controlled Radio Rwanda said
Wednesday the eastern Congolese towns of Goma and Bukavu were in
the hands of rebels opposed to President Laurent Kabila.
	   A Rwandan official, who asked not to be further identified, said
Kabila's foreign minister, Bizima Karaha, an ethnic Tutsi from
eastern Congo, had arrived in Goma, apparently to take up sides
with the rebels.
	   Rwanda has closed its border with Congo, and attempts by
reporters to cross over to Goma were fruitless.
	   Kabila accuses Rwanda of being behind attempts to oust him and
to sow chaos in the eastern part of the vast Democratic Repbublic
of Congo.
	   The Rwandan government denies any role in the eastern rebellion
or in revolts by ethnic Tutsi soldiers in the Congolese capital,
Kinshasa, but various officials have said they are not suprised by
the turn of events.
	   However, humanitarian sources have reported significant movement
of Rwandan troops in North Kivu province around Beni, Butembo and
Rutshuru and Goma and in Bukavu in South Kivu province.
	   A dozen U.S. military personnel in camouflage uniforms were seen
at the Gisenyi border post between Rwanda and Congo Wednesday
morning.
	   A spokesman for the U.S. Army's European Command in Stuttgart,
Germany, said the men were the Rwanda Interagency Assessment Team
that has been in the country for about 10 days and will stay
another 10 days to two weeks.
	   ``Yes, we do have soldiers there, approximately 12, that make up
the RIAT assessment team. They were in the vicinity of Gisenyi.
They are now en route to Kigali (the Rwandan capital),'' said Maj.
Henry L. Huntley.
	   He said the team's mission was to ``assess the current military
situation in Rwanda and to determine the Rwandan military
capability to deter, contain or minimize the threat of insurgency
and genocidal acts.''
	   Huntley said the team was in Rwanda in response to President
Bill Clinton's April 1998 pledge in Kigali ``to do all that the
U.S. government could do to counter a resurgence of genocide.''
	   In 1994, at least half a million people, most of them minority
Tutsis, were killed in Rwanda in a Hutu government-orchestrated
genocide that lasted for three months until Tutsi rebels overthrew
the government and stopped the killing.
	   The government is now fighting Hutu rebels who attack Rwanda
from bases in eastern Congo.
	   The private Rwandan News Agency reported Tuesday that nine
unidentified members of the rebel alliance that brought Kabila to
power in May 1997 after an eight-month march across Zaire have come
out in support of the rebellion.
	   Citing a Tuesday night broadcast on Goma radio, RNA said the
members coming from various ethnic groups accused Kabila of
``making freedom fighters, senior politicians and army commanders
regret their contribution to the liberation war.''
	   Burundi, Rwanda's neighbor to the south, has also closed its
border with Congo, but Uganda to the north says its borders are
still open.
	   Rwanda and Uganda backed Kabila's rebellion that began in what
was then eastern Zaire in October 1996.

Ukrainian government desperate to collect budget, pension debts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - In a desperate attempt to raise budget
revenues and cut pension arrears, Ukraine's government brought
together some of the nation's biggest tax debtors Wednesday and
demanded that they pay.
	   The Pension Fund is owed more than 3 billion hryvna (dlrs 1.5
billion) in back payments, and the budget has been short about 7
billion hryvna (dlrs 3.5 billion) in revenues as of July 1,
officials said at the Cabinet meeting, according to the Interfax
news agency.
	   The cash-strapped Ukrainian government long has been looking for
ways to increase budget revenues and diminish the mounting wage and
pension arrears.
	   Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko made what looked like a
gesture of despair, telling the executives from about 2,300 debtor
organizations and companies they would not be allowed to leave the
meeting hall until some of the debts were paid.
	   There was no evidence that the threat was carried out.
	   Pustovoitenko ordered the executives to pay at least 35 percent
of their debts to the state Pension Fund and 5 percent of the
long-delayed budget payments, and to provide formal schedules of
debt repayments through 1998, Interfax reported.
	   ``The choice is either to put them in not so good a place (jail)
or to decide the issue in this hall,'' Pustovoitenko said. ``Let
the people judge whether we are right or wrong.''

Jubilo beats Nagoya Grampus 2-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Brazilian Adilson Dias Batista scored a penalty
goal, leading Jubilo Iwata to a 2-1 victory over the Nagoya Grampus
Eight Wednesday that kept Jubilo in the lead with one match left in
the first stage of Japan's professional soccer league season.
	   Iwata, the 1997 J-League champion, and the Shimizu S-Pulse both
are 12-4 with 36 points, but Iwata leads the 18-team league because
it has more goals than S-Pulse.
	   S-Pulse beat SanFrecce Hiroshima 1-0 on Tetsuyoshi Itoh's goal
in the 17th minute of the second half.
	   For Jubilo, Adilson's goal in the 39th minute gave his team a
2-0 lead. Its earlier goal, in the 20th minute, came when a free
kick by Dunga, the Brazilian national team captain at the World Cup
in France, went into the net after hitting Grampus Eight goalkeeper
Yuji Ito's back.
	   Tetsuya Okayama scored the Grampus Eight's lone goal in the 21st
minute of the second half.
	   Dunga returned to Japan last Saturday after Brazil lost 3-0 to
France in the World Cup championship game.
	   At Yokohama International Stadium, Spanish player Julio Salinas
scored in the first 15-minute extra time, giving the Yokohama
Marinos a 2-1 victory over Vissel Kobe.
	   At Kashima, the Kashima Antlers edged Cerezo Osaka 3-2 on Yasuo
Manaka's extra-time goal.
	   At Urawa, the Urawa Reds beat Verdy Kawasaki 4-2 in a penalty
shootout after the two teams tied 1-1 in the regulation 90 minutes
and two 15-minute extra periods.
	   In other matches, Avispa Fukuoka beat Consadole Sapporo 2-1, the
Yokohama Flugels beat Kashiwa Reysol 3-1, Kyoto Purple Sanga beat
Bellmare Hiratsuka 2-1 and Gamba Osaka beat JEF United Ichihara
3-2.
	   The second stage for the league, which is in its sixth season,
runs from Aug. 22 through Nov. 14.
	   If two different teams emerge as stage winners, they will play
off for the league championship in a two-leg series Nov. 21 and 28.

British military to remain in South Africa through 2001
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A British military team will remain in South
Africa through 2001 to help with the transformation of the South
African Armed Forces, the Ministry of Defense announced Wednesday.
	   Lord Gilbert, the defense procurement minister who is visiting
South Africa, said the government had decided to extend the British
Military Advisory and Training Team's stay, according to a
statement from the ministry.
	   The British team was created in 1994 at the request of South
African President Nelson Mandela, following the country's first
democratic elections to act as an independent referee in the
formation of a united military force. It has monitored the
integration of the African National Congress' military wing into
the the overwhelmingly white, apartheid-era military.
	   Gilbert also announced that Britain will contribute 100,000
pounds (dlrs 164,000) toward a multinational peacekeeping exercise
to be held in southern Africa later this year.

Thai brewer agrees to change beer ads that show drunken governor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Complaints from the Thai Interior
Ministry that a television commercial for a new beer is insulting
to provincial governors prompted the country's top brewer to change
the ad Wednesday.
	   The 90-second advertisement by Boon Rawd brewery for its new
brand, Leo, depicts a governor getting so drunk at a wedding party
that he keeps proposing toasts after all the guests have left.
	   The ministry, which appoints provincial governors, asked that
the brewer cut at least the final 15 seconds, which show the
governor at his most drunk. The brewer agreed Wednesday.
	   Chatichai Wiratyosin, deputy marketing manager of Boon Rawd,
said there has been no real pressure from the ministry, but the
company will cut the sequence out of sensitivity toward customers.
	   ``There is no outside force involved in our decision,''
Chatichai said. ``We just don't want to upset the governors, who
are part of our marketing target.''
	   The company spent 5.5 million baht (dlrs 137,500) on producing
the advertising campaign. The ad has been on the air since June 24.
	   Leo, short for Leopard, is Boon Rawd's new, inexpensive beer,
designed to compete with a low-priced rival, Chang, that has cut
deeply into Boon Rawd's market share.
	   ``We were a bit surprised that some governors don't pick the
campaign up as a joke like others do,'' Chatichai said.
	   Chatchai said that cutting the end will not affect the campaign,
nor cause any loss of market share.
	   Boon Rawd now holds about a 48 percent share of the Thai beer
market. As recently as two years ago, Boon Rawd held about an 80
percent share of the 40 billion baht (dlrs 952 million) beer
market, mainly through sales of its flagship Singha brand.
	   Leo is expected to capture 10 percent of the market within two
years.

New gas pipeline launched in Ukraine's Crimea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukrainian workers on Wednesday launched
construction of new pipeline that would provide natural gas to
southeastern Crimea, a news report said.
	   President Leonid Kuchma, who is vacationing on the Black Sea
peninsula, attended the event, the Interfax news agency said.
	   The dlrs 75 million to 100 million, 269-kilometer (167-mile)
pipeline, whose planned construction was frozen in 1995 due to a
lack of funds, is expected to be completed in a year, officials
said.
	   It would link the Crimean cities of Dzhankoi, Feodosia and
Kerch, improving the natural gas supply to about 30 percent of
Crimea's populace, which long has coped with energy and hot water
shortages.

Arafat presents new cabinet, but most ministers keep jobs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES throughout with new quotes, details, vote
scheduled for Saturday &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
announced a new Cabinet on Wednesday, a year after legislators
demanded the old one be dissolved because of widespread corruption.
	   But all of the ministers accused of corruption kept their jobs _
raising skepticism about Arafat's pledge of ``accountability and
transparency'' in all government institutions.
	   ``It's a big disappointment,'' said Ziad Abu Amr, an independent
legislator from the Gaza Strip. ``We still have the old government.
We have no change.''
	   Despite opposition from legislators such as Abu Amr, the new
Cabinet is expected to be approved when it comes up for a vote
Saturday in the legislative council, which is dominated by Arafat's
Fatah faction.
	   The council voted 57-1 last year to demand that Arafat dissolve
the Cabinet after a legislative committee report found extensive
abuses in all government ministries and recommended that three
ministers _ Planning Minister Nabil Shaath, Civil Affairs Minister
Jamil Tarifi, and Transportation Minister Ali Qawasmeh _ be put on
trial.
	   The three ministers, who denied any wrongdoing, all retained
their jobs in Arafat's new Cabinet.
	   The committee report followed a government audit that found
nearly half the Palestinian Authority's dlrs 800 million annual
budget had been squandered through corruption and mismanagement.
	   Despite repeated promises, Arafat put off any action for months,
until the legislative council threatened to hold a vote of
no-confidence in his government.
	   On Wednesday, Arafat appeared before a council meeting in the
West Bank town of Ramallah and announced a new Cabinet that
included all but one of the old ministers, as well as 10 new faces.
All but one of the new ministers are Fatah members.
	   Arafat retained control of the Interior Ministry, which controls
the Palestinian security forces, and took over the Education
Ministry from the aging Yasser Amro.
	   Arafat announced the creation of three new ministries:
environment, parliamentary affairs, and prisoner affairs. The
official Palestinian Authority newspaper, Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, said
a ministry of Israeli settlement affairs would also be established,
headed by legislator Salah Tamari.
	   Jerusalem legislator Ziad Abu Zayyad was named a minister, in a
direct slight to Faisal Husseini, the top PLO official in
Jerusalem, who has played the role of minister in charge of
Jerusalem affairs.
	   Abu Zayyad's portfolio was not announced, but Palestinian
reports have said that Arafat wanted to replace Husseini with Abu
Zayyad. Husseini has been critical of the Palestinian Authority for
failing to act aggressively enough on behalf of the Palestinian
claims to the disputed city.
	   In his speech to the council, Arafat said there had been
``constant improvement in all of the Palestinian Authority
ministries and institutions. There is more awareness of law and
order and the interests of the people and the homeland.''
	   Arafat said the government's platform was ``to continue building
Palestinian institutions and to reinforce law and order and the
foundations of an independent judiciary, human rights, pluralism,
accountability and transparency in all institutions of the
Palestinian Authority.''

Mentally ill Holocaust survivors denied use of reparations money
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Israeli caretakers have refused to allow German
reparations paid to mentally ill Holocaust survivors to be used to
improve the victims' conditions in hospitals, doctors said
Wednesday.
	   The patients, many of them in their 80s, suffer from acute
depression and other mental illnesses as a result of their
experiences in the Nazi death camps. A number have accumulated
large sums of money from compensation paid by the German
government.
	   However, because of their sickness, the survivors are wards of
the state, and their bank accounts are administered by the
court-appointed Fund for the Care of Dependents, which is
supervised by the government's General Custodian for Wards.
	   The daily Maariv newspaper, which reported the story Wednesday,
said in the early years after Israel's creation, from 1948-1952,
the government refused to accept mentally ill Holocaust survivors
from Germany. In 1952, a ship arrived from Germany with about 1,200
of them, the paper said, and between 800 and 900 are still alive.
	   No figure was available for the total value of Holocaust
victims' property held by the Israeli government, but Jonathan
Lemberger, head of a survivors support organization, told The
Associated Press said it runs into billions of dollars.
	   The Abarbanel Hospital near Tel Aviv recently submitted requests
to the trustees for money to install air-conditioners, buy
television sets for the patients and to serve festive meals on
Independence Day or other festivals.
	   They were refused on the grounds that other patients in the room
would also benefit, not just the patient whose money was being
used, said Avner Elitsur, director of the psychiatric ward.
	   ``Unfortunately, there are still eight patients in a room,'' he
told The AP. ``We pointed out that the other patients are also
Holocaust survivors, but it didn't help.''
	   Asa Kasher, professor of philosophy and ethics at Tel Aviv
University, said the conduct of the officials towards the patients
was ``insensitive and immoral.''
	   ``How long do these unfortunate people have to live?'' he said.
``Can't we at least do something to make their last years a little
happier?''
	   Tsur, and the director of the fund, Avi Angel, blamed each other
for the failure to improve patient living conditions. Each said he
would gladly have authorized the expenditure.
	   ``I am all in favor of alleviating the suffering of the
patients,'' Tsur told The AP. ``But I don't administer the
patients' accounts personally. I am the government's supervisor,
but the money is administered by the fund, and its directors don't
consult me.''
	   However, Angel said whenever the expenditure is not exclusively
for the ward's personal use, he cannot authorize it without the
express permission of the Tsur, and this is usually refused.
	   ``We initiated the plan to install TV sets, videos and air
conditioners for the survivors. We wanted to hold celebrations on
the festivals, to bring a bit of light into their lives. But the
custodian refuses to authorize it.''
	   The custodian's denial, which was also made in an interview with
Israel radio, was rejected by a volunteer group which cares for
Holocaust survivors.
	   ``He is sitting on billions of dollars which belonged to
Holocaust survivors, many of whom died without heirs, but he and
other officials involved refuse to spend it to help those still
alive, although the law says that is what it should be used for,''
said Jonathan Lemberger, head of the AMCHA group.
	   AMCHA provides psychological counseling and other support to the
survivors, many of whom have feelings of guilt because they lived
while their loved ones perished, Lemberger said.
	   When the group wanted to open a club for the survivors in the
northern city of Carmiel, officials refused to release the
necessary funds from the legacies, he said.
	   Lemberger said the custodian's inaction was symptomatic of the
Israeli government's attitude to the survivors.
	   ``When they die their money will pass to the state,'' he said.
``Israel complains about the Holocaust victims' money Switzerland
is holding. What about the money the Israeli government is
holding?''

Zurich launches campaign to locate Holocaust policy holders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ A leading Swiss insurer on Wednesday
launched a U.S. advertising campaign to locating Holocaust
survivors and heirs who could be beneficiaries of its life
insurance policies.
	   Zurich Insurance Co. said its advertisement, headed ``A Message
From Zurich Insurance To Holocaust Survivors And Heirs,'' will
appear starting Thursday in 10 U.S. newspapers.
	   They include The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Los
Angeles Times and The Miami Herald.
	   ``We believe it is our corporate responsibility to reach out to
the Jewish community in this fashion in order to increase the
opportunity for anyone who believes they may be a beneficiary of a
Zurich policy to come forward,'' chairman Rolf Hueppi said in a
statement.
	   Zurich is one of four European insurance companies that in April
reached agreement with California Insurance Commissioner Chuck
Quackenbush and New York State Insurance Commissioner Neil D. Levin
to form an international commission that will ensure insurance
claims are paid.
	   Also in April, it set up its own ``international commission of
eminent persons'' to review disputed life insurance claims arising
from the Holocaust era.
	   Zurich, then operating as Vita Life, had ``a small insurance
portfolio in various European countries'' before and during World
War II, the advertisement said.
	   ``At all relevant times, Zurich held a minor market position in
Germany and German-occupied territories,'' it added.
	   The firm said that inquiries, either direct to the insurer or
via state insurance commissioners' offices, ``will be handled with
expediency, understanding and compassion.''

German politicians urge Holocaust Memorial plans to move forward
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Leading members of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
party urged the Berlin city council Tuesday to speed approval of
plans for a national Holocaust Memorial in the city's center.
	   ``It's already late, but not too late,'' said Rita Suessmuth,
president of the lower house of parliament.
	   After more than 10 years of debate, officials hope to begin
construction of the memorial in the heart of Berlin next year, with
federal, city and private funds.
	   But the city council still must approve the plans, and Kohl must
choose a design from a group of three finalists. Kohl has promised
to name his choice before Sept. 27 national elections.
	   Whether the monument gets built at all, however, may depend on
the outcome of the election.
	   The opposition Social Democrats designated cultural affairs czar
said the party may not abide by Kohl's decision if it wins. Michael
Naumann has criticized any central memorial as too ``monumental,''
and has said he would rather see a national documentation center
about Nazi genocide and better maintenance of former concentration
camps.
	   Heiner Geissler, party leader for Kohl's Christian Democrats in
parliament, also urged the Berlin council to approve the plan,
complaining that the monument had become a campaign issue.
	   Geissler attacked Naumann's position as a ``cultural fad.'' He
said few people actually visit the camps, and that therefore a
central memorial in Berlin is needed to remember the deaths of six
million Jews during the Holocaust.

Paul McCartney breaks silence by talking to animal rights

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In his first interviews since his wife's death in
April, former Beatle Paul McCartney promised to keep the ``torch
burning'' by continuing her animal rights crusade.
	   McCartney chose to speak to two animal rights publications _ the
Animal Times, run by the U.S.-based People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals, and the British-based Viva Life.
	   ``Animal rights is too good an idea for the next century to be
suppressed,'' he told Animal Times. ``I think it's time we get
nice.''
	   Linda McCartney headed a multimillion-pound (dollar) vegetarian
food empire and was instrumental in setting up Vegetarians
International Voice for Animals, which runs Viva Life.
	   McCartney said he wanted to prove he is as committed to animal
rights as his wife was.
	   ``I'm grieving, but I say to the kids, `We have to look at the
blessings and replace all the bad memories with good ones,' '' he
told Animal Times.
	   Both interviews are to be published next month.

Rights activist says 11 mass graves found in Indonesian province
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to move background on rebellion higher; one name
correct for Rufriadi, Munir &QL; 
 &UR; By ALI KOTARUMALOS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A human rights group said Wednesday it
had found 11 mass graves, possibly containing hundreds of bodies of
people allegedly killed by Indonesian troops in the troubled
northernmost province of Aceh.
	   The Indonesian military has long been accused of arbitrary
killing and torture in Aceh, a strongly Muslim province about 1,750
kilometers (1,100 miles) northwest of Jakarta.
	   Some human rights groups claim thousands of people have been
killed there since a separatist rebellion started in the late
1980s.
	   Rufriadi, a lawyer at the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation in the
provincial capital of Banda Aceh, said he and another human rights
activist found the graves in four remote locations on the northern
tip of Sumatra Island last month.
	   He estimated that each burial site could contain as many 50
bodies and that other burial sites might also exist.
	   ``There are at least eight mass graves in villages in North Aceh
regency, and one each in Central Aceh, East Aceh and Pidie
regencies,'' Rufriadi said.
	   One of the sites was nicknamed ``Skull Hill'' by local people.
	   There was no immediate comment from the military.
	   However, a parliamentary team that went to the province last
week to investigate allegations of human rights abuses denied
earlier local media reports that it had found evidence of mass
graves.
	   In a telephone interview, Rufriadi told The Associated Press
that local villagers had shown him the mass grave sites.
	   They alleged elite Indonesian troops had shot the victims.
	   ``They include villagers who claimed to have been forced to bury
the dead bodies under gunpoint,'' Rufriadi said. ``They all say
that it was the work of the military.''
	   The province has endured rebellions for generations dating back
to Dutch colonial times several centuries ago.
	   Besides the mass graves, Rufriadi said he had located a
traditional village house that local people alleged had been used
as a torture center by troops.
	   Allegations of mass graves follow a separate investigation into
accusations that elite troops kidnapped dozens of anti-government
activists in the weeks before authoritarian former President
Suharto stepped down in May.
	   Aceh, one of three Indonesian provinces where rebels are
fighting for independent states, was put under the status of
Military Operation Region in 1991.
	   The other two provinces are Irian Jaya in the western part of
New Guinea and the former Portuguese colony of East Timor.
	   Meanwhile, a Jakarta hospital plans a post mortem examination of
three bodies found buried on a beach on an island off the capital,
a human rights activist said.
	   Munir, who chairs the Commission of Disappeared People and the
Victims of Violence, said the three bodies were found by local
residents two weeks ago.
	   Munir feared the bodies were those of missing anti-government
activists.
	   He said the badly decayed corpses were found with watches,
wallets and name cards, but had not been positively identified.

Kosovo Albanians caught at Hungarian-Slovakian border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Forty ethnic Albanians from embattled
Kosovo were caught trying to illegally cross the
Hungarian-Slovakian border Wednesday, a border guards spokesman
said.
	   The 36 adults and four children, together with the Slovakian
assisting them, were detained near the Parassapuszta border
crossing, 60 kilometers (35 miles) north of Budapest, Lt. Col.
Tamas Csiszar said by telephone.
	   The ethnic Albanians were taken into custody.
	   It was the third such incident in the past week involving Kosovo
Albanians trying to reach the West through Hungary.
	   Since the outbreak of the crisis in the Yugoslav province last
March, the number of ethnic Albanians fleeing the atrocities has
risen significantly.
	   ``Most of them want to travel on to Germany, and pay hundreds,
sometimes thousands of German marks to human smugglers,'' said
Istvan Dobo, head of the State Office for refugees.

Thai authorities raid shops selling Viagra; counterfeits denied
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai authorities denied Wednesday that
the country has become a Viagra counterfeiting center, but
meanwhile raided three pharmacies illegally selling the
anti-impotence drug.
	   The owners of the pharmacies were arrested and face up to five
years imprisonment for trafficking in illegal substances, police
said. A total of 157 Viagra tablets were seized.
	   Thailand has tentatively approved Viagra as safe but final
permission to import and sell it has not yet been granted by the
country's Food and Drug Administration.
	   A black market has developed for the drug, with a single pill
selling for about 1,200 baht (dlrs 30).
	   Thai media have reported this week that Thai counterfeiters are
producing fake Viagra pills composed primarily of flour, and
selling them for the same price as the real ones.
	   Rawiwan Preedisanit, director of the FDA's Drug Control
Division, told The Associated Press that the assertions were false
and that it was unproven that the fake Viagra existed.
	   The newspaper Bangkok Post cited Mongkol na Songkhla,
secretary-general of the FDA, as saying Tuesday that other
countries were a source of phony Viagra entering Thailand.

a park-in at Pakistan's main fuel terminal Wednesday, blocking
supplies from reaching gas stations across the country.
	   Wednesday's protest widens a blockade of the Shell terminal in
the port city of Karachi that began 10 days ago after Shell
declared it would replace independent truckers with its own
delivery system.
	   Shell officials said they had found tanker seals had been
tampered with before trucks reached gas stations, raising the
possibility drivers had siphoned off gas to sell on their own and
mixed kerosene or some other substance into the fuel supplied to
stations.
	   Police removed trucks from the Shell terminal overnight. But
Wednesday morning, more truckers joined the protest, blocking the
road to terminals owned by Caltex and the state oil companies along
with Shell's.
	   Drivers pelted terminal buildings with stones Wednesday morning.
They fled when police arrived, leaving their trucks behind.
	   Shell stations in Karachi had already been short on supplies,
and consumers could soon see gas shortages at stations around the
country. Government officials said they were negotiating with the
drivers to resolve the dispute.
	   Several thousands tankers fill up every day at the Karachi
terminal.

Thai prime minister wants military to investigate illegal weapons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai ordered
the Thai military Wednesday to investigate whether weapons from an
illegal arsenal seized in a police raid last week came from army
stores, Thai television reported.
	   Police have alleged that at least some of the M-16 assault
rifles, rocket-propelled grenade launchers and more than 50,000
rounds of ammunition seized at a house in Bangkok appear to be Thai
army equipment.
	   The house owner, a former army sergeant who was court-martialed
in 1994 for illegally selling weapons, was arrested and claimed
that he had rented the home to ethnic Karen guerrillas who are
fighting the military government of neighboring Myanmar.
	   Thailand's supreme armed forces commander, Gen. Mongkol
Ampornpisit, denied the police allegations that the weapons came
from army stockpiles and said control procedures were too strict to
allow such a quantity of weapons to go missing.
	   However, police suspect a renegade army officer may be involved.
Chuan, the first civilian to hold the post of defense minister in
20 years, asserted his rank over Mongkol on Wednesday and ordered
the military to get to the bottom of it.

Iraqi Parliament calls for end to cooperation with U.N. inspectors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's parliament on Wednesday demanded an
immediate end to cooperation with international weapons inspectors
to protest the 8-year-old U.N. economic sanctions on the country.
	   The 250-member National Assembly unanimously adopted a
resolution urging President Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi leaders
to act on the recommendation by Parliament Speaker Sadoun Hammadi.
	   The Parliament's vote paves the way for a ban on cooperation
with the inspectors but leaves the final decision on when and
whether to implement it with Saddam.
	   Still, the rubber stamp Parliament is unlikely to have made such
an important decision without Saddam's prior approval. In the next
formality, the vote will have to be approved by the Revolutionary
Command Council, the most powerful decision-making body in Iraq.
	   A statement issued at the end of a six-hour session said: ``The
National Assembly calls for stopping cooperation'' with the U.N.
Special Commission, which is charged with overseeing the
elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   The statement also demanded the U.N. Security Council lift the
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait and ban the
free sale of oil, the country's economic mainstay.
	   However, the sanctions can only be lifted when the inspectors
announce that Iraq is free of illegal weapons.
	   Since the inspectors do not appear ready to give that
certification there is no point in cooperating with it, the
Parliament said.
	   It said lawmakers pledged full support for any measures Saddam
takes and urged him to ``firmly carry out'' their recommendation
and any other steps he feels necessary.
	   On Tuesday, Saddam approved a series of undisclosed measures to
fight the sanctions, which the National Assembly were discussing.
It was not clear if ``non-cooperation'' _ blocking the inspectors
from visiting suspected weapons sites or witholding information and
documents _ with the United Nations was among them.
	   The confrontation was triggered by the collapse of disarmament
talks Monday between chief weapons inspector Richard Butler and
chief Iraqi negotiator, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.
	   Butler cut short his visit and left Baghdad on Tuesday. He is
scheduled to report Thursday to the Security Council.
	   The impasse was over Aziz's demand for an immediate
certification that Iraq is free of illegal weapons, which Butler
refused.
	   But Butler sought to play down the seriousness of the argument.
In a stopover in London en route to New York, Butler said he
already had told U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan by telephone
that the troubles should not be exaggerated.
	   ``I said very specifically to him that I don't think any of us
should describe this as a crisis,'' he told BBC radio.
	   Butler said he did not understand why Aziz cut short the talks
since he had told Aziz the inspectors were ``very close'' to
certifying Iraq had destroyed its missiles and chemical weapons.
Though he added they were ``not close'' to solving the problem of
biological weapons.
	   Criticism of Iraq by Britain and the United States appeared more
muted than in past confrontations, when the two countries
threatened military action.
	   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin
said Saddam had ``shot himself in the foot'' by mishandling a
chance to end economic sanctions. ``Iraq has only harmed itself,''
Rubin said.
	   Iraq's official newspapers stressed anew, meanwhile, that U.N.
weapons inspectors were cooperating in American plots against
Saddam's government by refusing to confirm that the country had
eliminated its weapons systems.
	   The daily Al-Thawra, the official paper of Saddam's ruling
party, ridiculed the idea that Iraq should be considered a threat
after the years of work by the inspectors.
	   ``After seven years of inspections, monitoring, obtaining
documents, destroying factories and ... searching presidential
sites, they say that Iraq is a threat,'' said the paper.

Manchester United, Arsenal confirm Super League talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ After weeks of secret talks and self-imposed
silence, Manchester United and Arsenal confirmed Wednesday they are
involved in talks on forming a breakaway European Super League.
	   While insisting they remain committed to the English Premier
League, the two clubs said they were discussing the creation of a
new league which would change the face of European soccer.
	   There was no immediate comment from Liverpool, the third English
club reportedly approached about joining the proposed 32-team
competition.
	   British newspapers said the Super League idea is spearheaded by
former Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate and
owner of Serie A club AC Milan, and has the dlrs 2 billion backing
of Wall Street bank J.P. Morgan.
	   According to the reports, the league would kick off in the year
2000 and involve mid-week matches between Europe's elite clubs such
as Inter and AC Milan, Juventus, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern
Munich and Ajax Amsterdam.
	   The Super League would effectively replace UEFA's Champions
League.
	   Clubs involved in the new league would make more money from
television and advertising than they get from the UEFA
competitions. They also would be guaranteed permanent membership in
the league, without having to qualify each year as they do for the
UEFA tournaments.
	   FIFA and UEFA, soccer's world and European governing bodies,
have warned that clubs and players involved in a breakaway could be
banned from international competition.
	   And the English Premier League has threatened to kick out any
clubs which join without prior consultation.
	   Legal experts, however, say it could be impossible to stop the
league from going ahead as organizers would be protected by
restraint-of-trade laws.
	   The statements released by United and Arsenal were almost
identical.
	   ``Manchester United/Arsenal confirms that it is involved in
discussions concerning the formation of proposed new European
competitions,'' one of the statements said. ``We would, however,
stress that we are totally committed to the FA Premier League and
other domestic competitions and are very mindful of our
responsibilities to the governing bodies.
	   ``There is no question of Arsenal committing to a new
competition until all appropriate consultations have taken place.
Football is a developing industry and we have a duty to examine any
serious proposal that we feel might be beneficial to Arsenal
Football Club, its fans, shareholders and football generally.''

Firefighters struggle to extinguish last fronts of fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Firefighters struggled Wednesday to stamp
out the last fronts of a massive forest fire that reduced large
parts of rare Athens area woodlands to cinders.
	   But authorities expressed concern that a forecasted return of
strong winds could rekindle the fire, which officials have
speculated was started deliberately late Sunday.
	   Hundreds of houses have reportedly been damaged or destroyed in
villages near the foot of Mount Pendeli, about four kilometers (2
1/2 miles) northeast of Athens. The area is one of the last major
tracts of forest ringing Athens.
	   No injuries due to the fires were reported.
	   A summer camp for disabled children on Pendeli was destroyed, as
was a German World War II cemetery and several factories. The
flames also threatened the Athens suburb of Vrilissia.
	   Fire officials suspect arsonists started the fire. In the past,
landowners have been accused of starting fires to clear the way for
construction.
	   Meanwhile, fires in other parts of Greece still raged unchecked.
	   Authorities declared a state of emergency in the region of
Messinia, in the southwestern Peloponnese, following the rekindling
of a fire on Mount Taygetos that began last week.
	   The residents of three nearby villages were told to prepare for
possible evacuation, media reported.
	   Local officials expressed fears of an ecological disaster from
the blaze, which has ravaged one of the few remaining untouched
black pine forests in Greece.
	   Two weeks ago, three firefighters and a volunteer firefighter
were killed battling a blaze that scorched the eastern edge of
Athens.
	   Wildfires are common during the hot and dry summers in Greece.
But this season has been called one of the most devastating in
decades, with fires burning daily for the past month.

Thousands of Bulgarian job-seekers in western Europe forced into
</HEADLINE>
prostitution
 &UR; By VESELIN ZHELEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgarian (AP) _ Thousands of Bulgarian women who seek
jobs in western Europe fall victim to criminals running brothels
and are forced into virtual sex slavery, a Bulgarian organization
said Wednesday.
	   La Strada, an international non-governmental organization aimed
at fighting the illegal trafficking of women that recently opened a
branch in the Bulgarian capital, released information Wednesday
showing that roughly 10,000 Bulgarian have forced into prostitution
abroad.
	   According to Nadia Kozhuharova, an activist with La Strada,
dubious employment agencies based in Bulgaria usually attract women
aged 14 to 25 by offering them jobs as house servants or baby
sitters in western Europe.
	   Statistics from La Strada said traffickers sell a young woman to
pimps in western Europe for 2,000 and 5,000 German marks (dlrs
1,100 to 2,700). The average prostitute earns the equivalent of
dlrs 42,000 in net profit per year, of which she sees nothing.
	   Most of the women are initially taken to other east European
countries where they don't require an entry visa, such as the Czech
Republic, Poland and Hungary, said Kozhuharova. From there, the
women are illegally transferred to Germany, Belgium, Italy and
Netherlands.
	   Once they arrive in the West, the ``employment agents'' usually
confiscate the women's passports, keeping the women dependent.
	   ``Then the girls are submitted to rapes, severe beating and
starvation until they accept to become prostitutes in order to save
their lives,'' said Maria Chomarova, an activist at La Strada.
	   So far, 20 Bulgarian women who were able to flee their patrons
in western Europe have returned to the home country and told La
Strada horror stories about their experiences.
	   ``One of the girls said it has been tied to the back of a car
and dragged,'' Chomarova said. ``Others had numbers branded on
their skin.''
	   La Strada is funded by the Netherlands and has branches across
eastern Europe. In addition to helping women return home safely,
the group also helps psychologically rehabilitate survivors and
reintegrate them into society.
	   But despite recent attempts by western governments to address
the problem, La Strada is often unable to help prosecute the
traffickers, as the women are reluctant to speak about their
ordeals.
	   Because most of the women who are able to break free involve
either being kicked out of the brothel and caught by the police,
getting pregnant or escaping with a client, the women often live in
fear and are afraid to go to the authorities.
	   Bulgaria is grappling with the aftermath of a devastating
economic crisis that peaked a year ago. The average salary is dlrs
100 per month. Some 400,000 Bulgarians have emigrated, mainly to
western Europe, since the collapse of communism in 1989.

Singaporeans spend more overseas than tourists do in republic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Retail sales are declining at home while
bargain-hunting Singaporeans spend more abroad than tourists and
businessmen do when they visit the island-state, a Cabinet minister
said Wednesday.
	   ``It means prices here should be more competitive,'' said Lim
Boon Heng, who heads the National Trades Union Congress and is also
a Cabinet minister. ``We cannot merely appeal to nationalism to
persuade the Singaporean to buy locally, or legislate that they
do.''
	   He noted that the consumer price index for June showed a decline
for the first time in almost 11 years.
	   ``In the months ahead, we can expect the CPI to decline if the
Singapore dollar remains relatively strong and domestic demand
remains weak,'' Lim said.
	   Singaporeans are known for going on shopping trips to nearby
countries and seldom miss a chance to bargain-hunt while
vacationing.
	   Lim said that the amount Singaporeans spent in foreign countries
doubled from 1992 to 1996, reaching 6.6 billion Singapore dollars
(dlrs 3.84 billion).
	   That topped the 5.3 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 3.08
billion) tourists spent in Singapore in 1996.
	   He said Singaporeans' overseas spending went up even further
last year, to 7.3 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 4.24 billion).
But he did not give a figure for tourist spending for 1997.

Analysts say India keen to diffuse tensions in South Asia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BY HEMA SHUKLA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India is promising not to be the first
to use nuclear weapons and to not use the weapons against a
non-nuclear state, but analysts said Wednesday that the offer is
unlikely to satisfy international opinion or ease sanctions brought
on by India's nuclear tests.
	   Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee announced the commitment in
a speech to Parliament Tuesday. He also repeated his willingness to
negotiate India's signature on the global test ban treaty
	   Earlier, India had offered to discuss a no-first-use agreement
with Pakistan, its rival and neighbor with whom it has fought three
wars. Both countries became declared nuclear powers last May when
they conducted a series of underground tests.
	   On Tuesday, Vajpayee went farther because he asked for no
reciprocal commitment from Pakistan or any other countries, said
defense analyst K. Subrahmanyam. He said it showed a determination
to defuse the tensions in South Asia that were heightened by the
nuclear tests.
	   ``We see a unilateral commitment, which is significant,'' he
said.
	   India announced a self-imposed moratorium on further tests
within days of exploding atomic devices under India's western
desert. The tests brought international condemnation, economic
sanctions and retaliatory tests by Pakistan.
	   In Parliament, Vajpayee said India would not use nuclear weapons
against any non-nuclear country. That declaration, said political
analyst B.G. Verghese, went further than the United States, Britain
and France, which have said they would use nuclear weapons as a
last resort.
	   ``It is clear that India is adopting a more mature position and
a more humane one,'' said Verghese, of the Center for Policy
Research, an independent think tank.
	   But it was unlikely that Western nations, which have blocked
loans and restricted transfers of technology that could be applied
to nuclear weapons, would be impressed with Vajpayee's position,
Verghese said.
	   In his speech, Vajpayee also said it was important to keep
talking to Pakistan and to keep the simmering dispute over the
disputed territory of Kashmir in ``cold storage.''
	   Vajpayee's talks last week with his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz
Sharif, failed to overcome procedural hurdles that have blocked the
revival of formal diplomatic talks on a range of problems,
including Kashmir.

Cyprus raises defense levy by one percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Parliament Wednesday approved a one
percent increase in the defense levy that citizens must pay to
cover increased military expenditure.
	   The increase _ from two percent to three percent of income _ is
expected to net about 40 million Cyprus pounds (about dlrs 80
million), said Finance Minister Christodoulos Christodoulou.
	   This will raise the 1998 budgeted figure for defense to just
under 250 million Cyprus pounds (about dlrs 500 million).
	   Cyprus has been spending heavily on new weapons systems in
recent years, including the controversial purchase of Russian S-300
anti-aircraft missiles. The government has not revealed the cost of
these missiles but various press reports put it at dlrs 400
million.
	   The missile deal has contributed to increased tension on the
island which has been divided into a Greek Cypriot controlled south
and a Turkish-occupied north since 1974 when Turkey invaded in the
wake of an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece. A
breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north is only recognized by
Turkey which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   ``Defense spending is increasing not because we are preparing
for war, but as a necessary defense measure because of Turkey's
expansionist policy,'' said Christodoulou.
	   Turkey has warned that it will prevent the deployment of the
Russian missiles, prompting pledges of support for Cyprus from
Greece.

Robson: Gascoigne should steer clear of alcohol to recapture form
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIDDLESBROUGH, England (AP) _ Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson
advised former England star Paul Gascoigne to cut down on partying
and drinking if he wants to regain form.
	   Glenn Hoddle created a storm of controversy when he omitted
``Gazza'' from England's final squad for the France '98 World Cup.
	   But Hoddle's decision to leave the 31-year-old international
veteran out of the Euro 2000 training squad announced Tuesday was
not a surprise.
	   Gascoigne is renowned for his late-night drinking sessions and
it could be his off-field lifestyle which cost him his place in the
England team, although Hoddle said the ``door is still open for
Gazza.''
	   Robson said a ``fit and healthy Gazza'' could ignite the Premier
League this season but he needed to focus on his fitness and
lifestyle.
	   ``There's a right time to go out and enjoy yourself and there's
a right time to knuckle down and get on top of your fitness before
you do enjoy a couple of drinks, and that's what Gazza's got to
do,'' Robson said.
	   ``He's in his 30s now and if Gazza wants to extend his career
into his late 30s then he's got to look at the way he lives and the
way he prepares himself for games.
	   ``He loves his football. We've had chats about it and I'm
certain Gazza will do that.''
	   Robson said Gascoigne would get over his latest selection
disappointment and get on with playing for Middlesbrough.
	   ``It's about him being 100 percent fit and enjoying his
football. I don't think he even looked at being in the (England)
build-up towards the European Championships,'' he said.
	   ``All I'm interested in at this moment in time is Paul Gascoigne
being fit and really enjoying his football.
	   ``If he is in that condition and that state of mind then I know
I'm going to have one helluva football player for next season.''

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese president Laurent Kabila on
Wednesday accused neighboring Rwanda of sending troops across its
borders, where ethnic Tutsi rebels reportedly captured two major
eastern towns.
	   Fighting was reported on Tuesday in Bukavu near the border with
Rwanda and in the village of Kitona on the opposite side of Congo
near the Atlantic coastline.
	   It was unclear whether the fighting continued through Wednesday,
but Rwanda's state-run radio reported that rebels had captured
Bukavu and Goma, the two biggest towns in Congo's troubled eastern
Kivu region.
	   ``Almost 400 army forces have come from Rwanda and have caused
Congolese bloodshed,'' Congolese government spokesman Didier
Mumengi said.
	   The report, which gave no details, could not be independently
confirmed.
	   Mumengi also said there was heavy fighting in the western
village of Kitona on Tuesday, but refused to elaborate on who was
in control of the town or its military base.
	   That battle began after rebel gunmen forced an airplane they had
hijacked to land in Kitona, about 225 kilometers (140 miles)
southwest of the capital, Kinshasa. The hijackers were believed to
be Banyamulenge ethnic fighters in the eastern city of Goma.
	   The rebellion began about a week after Kabila ordered all
Rwandan troops out of the country. He did not explain the move.
	   A Rwandan official, who asked not to be further identified, said
Bizima Karaha, an ethnic Tutsi and Congo's foreign minister, had
arrived in Goma, apparently to take up sides with the rebels.
	   Karaha did not return to Kinshasa from South Africa as scheduled
earlier this week, giving rise to speculation that he may have
sought political asylum in South Africa.
	   Rwanda, Burundi and Zambia have closed their borders with Congo
while France and the United States have warned their citizens not
to travel there.

Rights activist says 11 mass graves found in Indonesian province

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A human rights group said Wednesday it
had found 11 mass graves, possibly containing hundreds of bodies of
people allegedly killed by Indonesian troops in the troubled
northernmost province of Aceh.
	   The Indonesian military has long been accused of arbitrary
killing and torture in Aceh, a strongly Muslim province about 1,750
kilometers (1,100 miles) northwest of Jakarta.
	   Some human rights groups claim thousands of people have been
killed there since a separatist rebellion started in the late
1980s.
	   Rufriadi, a lawyer at the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation in the
provincial capital of Banda Aceh, said he and another human rights
activist found the graves in four remote locations on the northern
tip of Sumatra Island last month.
	   He estimated that each burial site could contain as many 50
bodies and that other burial sites might also exist.
	   ``There are at least eight mass graves in villages in North Aceh
regency, and one each in Central Aceh, East Aceh and Pidie
regencies,'' Rufriadi said.
	   One of the sites was nicknamed ``Skull Hill'' by local people.
	   There was no immediate comment from the military.
	   However, a parliamentary team that went to the province last
week to investigate allegations of human rights abuses denied
earlier local media reports that it had found evidence of mass
graves.
	   In a telephone interview, Rufriadi told The Associated Press
that local villagers had shown him the mass grave sites.
	   They alleged elite Indonesian troops had shot the victims.
	   ``They include villagers who claimed to have been forced to bury
the dead bodies under gunpoint,'' Rufriadi said. ``They all say
that it was the work of the military.''
	   The province has endured rebellions for generations dating back
to Dutch colonial times several centuries ago.
	   The latest one received a boost in December 1976 when the Aceh
Independence Movement was formed by a small group of business
people and professionals who complained that the economic benefits
of oil exploration in the area benefited only non-Acehnese. The
government claimed to have crushed the rebellion in mid-1991, but
apparently pockets of resistance remain.
	   Besides the mass graves, Rufriadi said he had located a
traditional village house that local people alleged had been used
as a torture center by troops.
	   Allegations of mass graves follow a separate investigation into
accusations that elite troops kidnapped dozens of anti-government
activists in the weeks before authoritarian former President
Suharto stepped down in May.
	   Aceh, one of three Indonesian provinces where rebels are
fighting for independent states, was put under the status of
Military Operation Region in 1991.
	   The other two provinces are Irian Jaya in the western part of
New Guinea and the former Portuguese colony of East Timor.
	   Meanwhile, a Jakarta hospital plans a post mortem examination of
three bodies found buried on a beach on an island off the capital,
a human rights activist said.
	   Munir, who chairs the Commission of Disappeared People and the
Victims of Violence, said the three bodies were found by local
residents two weeks ago.
	   Munir feared the bodies were those of missing anti-government
activists.
	   He said the badly decayed corpses were found with watches,
wallets and name cards, but had not been positively identified.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Dozens of ethnic Albanians were
buried last month at a garbage dump later leveled by bulldozers
after Serb forces overran a separatist stronghold in Kosovo, ethnic
Albanian media reported Wednesday.
	   The village of Orahovac, 50 kilometers (31 miles) southwest of
Pristina, was the scene of fierce battles in July between Serb
forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army fighting for independence for
Kosovo.
	   At least 60 civilians were killed in five days of fighting in
Orahovac, which fell into Serb hands on July 20, according to the
Pristina-based Committee for the Protection of Human Rights.
	   At a garbage dump about one kilometer (half-mile) outside
Orahovac, an Associated Press Television crew saw about 50 small
mounds of earth, marked with sticks, some of them bearing ethnic
Albanian names, others just numbers.
	   A small bulldozer that apparently leveled the terrain was still
at the site Wednesday.
	   Veton Surroi, a prominent ethnic Albanian politician who visited
the site Tuesday, claimed that as many as 200 Albanians were killed
in Orahovac, most of them in a mosque where they had taken refuge.
	   And in Vienna, Austria, the respected newspaper Die Presse said
Wednesday reporters had found fresh graves of more than 500 people,
including children, in the Orahovac area.
	   A Serb police source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
police had buried ``a number of bodies'' in the Orahovac area after
no one claimed them from a morgue after more than a week.
	   Fighting continued Wednesday between ethnic Albanian separatists
and Serb security forces in the central Kosovo region of Drenica,
according to ethnic Albanian sources.
	   Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic sent forces in March to
crush the KLA in Kosovo, whose ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs
9-to-1. Milosevic leads Serbia, the dominant republic of
Yugoslavia.

Seven killed as Kashmir shelling continues for seventh day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ At least seven people were killed and 17
were wounded Wednesday when Indian and Pakistani soldiers rained
mortar shells across their disputed frontier in Kashmir for a
seventh day.
	   Nearly 100 people have been killed since Thursday in one of the
heaviest and most prolonged peacetime border duels between the two
countries. India and Pakistan have fought three wars in the last 50
years, two of them over Kashmir.
	   Defense Minister George Fernandes told India's Parliament that
47 people, including 31 civilians, have been killed since last
Thursday, and 160 have been wounded. In Islamabad, officials say
nearly an equal number of Pakistanis have died from Indian fire.
	   Fernandes blamed Pakistan for the fighting, saying Pakistan is
getting increasingly frustrated that Indian soldiers are
intercepting Islamic militants fighting to secede from India.
Kashmir is India's only Muslim-majority state.
	   In Islamabad, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said the situation at
the boundary was still precarious.
	   ``Such a situation always carries the risk of escalation,'' he
said.
	   ``The Indian pounding ... is almost unprecedented for its
ferocity and the huge quantity of ammunition fired,'' the spokesman
said. Indian soldiers have fired more than 20,000 rounds across the
border, he said. It was not immediately clear how many rounds
Pakistani soldiers fired.
	   Officials in Srinagar, capital of Indian-held Kashmir, said four
paramilitary policemen were killed Tuesday night when mortar shells
fell on their camp. Five others were injured in the shelling at
Jabla in the Uri region of Kashmir, 120 kilometers (75 miles) north
of Srinagar.
	   Two civilians were killed and three injured in the same area
shortly after midnight, said the officials, who cannot be
identified under briefing rules. Nine civilians were injured by
fire farther north in the Kupwara district. One soldier was killed
in the Poonch sector, 280 kilometers (175 miles) southwest of
Srinagar.
	   Dozens of villagers fled their homes in Uri following the
shelling, officials said. Many others along the border have been
moving to safety in the last few days.
	   Meanwhile, security forces intensified patrols in Srinagar ahead
of the Aug. 15 anniversary of India's independence, a day that in
the past was marked by Kashmiri separatists by attacking Indian
targets.
	   Several suspected rebels were picked up, police said, without
saying how many.

Sri Lankan troops kill 14 Tamil rebels; one policeman dead

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lankan security forces killed 14
Tamil rebels and one policeman died in fresh fighting in the
nation's civil war, the Defense Ministry said Wednesday.
	   Eight of the deaths occurred Tuesday in the northern Mankulam
area where government troops are trying to dislodge rebels from a
strategic road to gain overland access to the Tamil heartland of
Jaffna.
	   Government troops captured Jaffna from Tamil rebels in 1995 but
rebels retain control of the road needed to send supplies to Jaffna
Peninsula. Currently, the peninsula can be reached only by air and
or sea.
	   Mankulam is 250 kilometers (155 miles) north of the capital and
is the largest town along the road.
	   In another encounter in Kilinochchi district, troops killed five
Tamil Tiger rebels on Tuesday after destroying the rebels' sea
base. Kilinochchi is 275 kilometers (170 miles) north of Colombo.
The area is also under military control.
	   One rebel and a policeman were killed in the Trincomalee
district during counterinsurgency operations, the Defense Ministry
said.
	   The rebels are fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils in the northern and eastern Sri Lanka, claiming that they
are discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese. The government
denies the charge.
	   At least 54,000 people have been killed since the fighting
started in 1983.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Improved tax collections in July show that Russia
is making progress in getting its budget in order under an
austerity program, Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said in an
interview published Wednesday.
	   Also, the government has not had to spend any of a dlrs 4.8
billion it recently received from the International Monetary Fund,
using the money instead to bolster the Central Bank's reserves,
Kiriyenko told the Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper.
	   The loan, part of a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package to be
released gradually as Russia cleans up its finances, helped avoid a
devaluation of the ruble, Kiriyenko said.
	   ``The country was nearing the edge. We have made a step back but
have not run far away from the precipice,'' he added.
	   Russia's tax collection figures are up, but receipts in August
will be lower than expected, partly because the Communist-dominated
parliament rejected some government plans for new tax laws before
breaking for summer vacation.
	   The sluggish tax reform progress may be a factor when the IMF
decides whether to release the next part of the loan next month.
	   International lenders are intent on keeping pressure on the
government to follow through with promises that have often melted
away in the past.
	   Tax receipts for August are expected to total 12.5 billion
rubles (dlrs 2 billion), up marginally from July, which was in turn
higher than June.
	   But the August figure will fall far short of the target of 14.8
billion rubles (dlrs 2.3 billion), Interfax reported.
	   Parliament's lower house, which is led by Communists, will
reconvene for a special session August 19-20 to consider a series
of austerity bills, including amended versions of bills rejected in
July, Gennady Seleznyov, the speaker of parliament, said Wednesday
after meeting Kiriyenko.
	   The government also plans to ask approval for up to six entirely
new bills from the parliament, which has blocked a number of
reforms the government has sought.
	   In other economic developments Wednesday:
	   _ The upcoming sale of a 5 percent stake in gas monopoly Gazprom
is attracting a number of potential foreign buyers, including Shell
and the Italian company ENI, Russian Deputy State Property Minister
Alexander Braverman said Wednesday.
	   _ Russia's stock market was down 3.3 percent at midday
Wednesday, mostly in response to the New York Stock Exchange's 300
point fall the day before.
	   _ Braverman said the Russian government earned 1.3 billion
rubles (dlrs 215 million) from privatization sales in the first
half of 1998, up from the previous year but well short of the
entire year's target of 8.1 billion rubles (dlrs 1.35 billion).

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Forces opposed to the ruling Taliban
religious militia claimed a victory Wednesday in fighting in
eastern Afghanistan, while the two front lines just outside the
northern opposition stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif were reported calm
Wednesday.
	   Abdullah, a spokesman for anti-Taliban alliance leader Ahmed
Shah Masood, said Masood's troops captured 25 Taliban bunkers after
a successful offensive about 200 kilometers (about 120 miles) east
of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   But Taliban spokesman Abdul Hay Muttayn said his forces repelled
the attack.
	   ``The opposition wants to keep the Taliban busy in different
parts of Afghanistan,'' said Muttayn, who had no details on the
fighting.
	   Fifty Taliban soldiers were killed and 112 captured in
Wednesday's eastern fighting, Abdullah said, making no mention of
alliance casualties.
	   The alliance is backed into a small corner of northern
Afghanistan. With Mazar-e-Sharif in sight, the Taliban appear
poised to capture all of the country.
	   Taliban leaders have imposed a strict version of Islamic law in
territory they control. Since capturing the Afghan capital, Kabul,
in 1996, Taliban officials have barred girls from school and
confined most women to their homes.
	   The anti-Taliban alliance is made up mostly of Afghanistan's
religious and ethnic minorities.
	   Earlier, Taliban officials reported no fighting around
Mazar-e-Sharif. Taliban fighters are reportedly closing in on the
city on two sides, with the front lines about 20 kilometers (12
miles) to the west and 40 kilometers (25 miles) to the east.
	   Tuesday, Taliban spokesman Muttayn said the religious militia
was pausing to build bunkers and take other measures to shore up
defenses around Mazar-e-Sharif. It was unclear when it would
attempt to capture the city.
	   Their hesitancy comes after a brutal defeat last May, when the
Taliban retreated from Mazar-e-Sharif after street battles in which
hundreds of Taliban soldiers died. As many as 2,000 Taliban
prisoners of war reportedly were later massacred.
	   ``We will once again beat the Taliban in the North,'' said
Masood spokesman Abdullah, who like many Afghans uses only one
name.
	   Abdullah spoke by telephone from London, from where he said he
had been in touch with Masood in northern Afghanistan.
	   Abdullah also repeated opposition claims that hundreds of
Pakistani soldiers were fighting alongside the Taliban in the
North. The Pakistani Foreign Ministry called the charges
``baseless.''
	   The United States has accused Pakistan of supplying weapons to
the Taliban. Pakistan denies the charge.

EU approves joint venture between 4 Internet service providers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union approved Wednesday a
joint venture between the French telecom company Cegetel, the
French communications group Canal Plus, America Online and
Germany's media group Bertelsmann.
	   The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, found that the
operation will ``not create or strengthen a dominant position, nor
will it lead to anticompetitive cooperation between the parent
companies.''
	   The deal concerns the creation of a joint venture called AOL/CIS
France S.A.S. that will market, develop and provide interactive
Internet services such as chat rooms and on-line sales to
non-enterprise customers, the statement said.
	   Last June, Cegetel and Canal Plus announced an agreement to
acquire more than half the French subsidiary of America Online and
Compuserve.
	   The remaining 45 percent of America Online and Compuserve France
is owned by the U.S. parent company America Online and by
Bertelsmann.
	   The Commission can veto alliances and mergers it judges hinder
fair competition rules in the 15-nation bloc.

	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Newcastle defender and former England
international Stuart Pearce was hospitalized with back injuries
Wednesday after his car collided with a truck on a country road.
	   Pearce, a former England captain who was left off England's
squad for the World Cup in France, was listed in ``comfortable''
condition at the Queen's Medical Center in Nottingham.
	   A hospital statement said Pearce wanted his fans to know he was
``OK.''
	   Pearce was alone in his car when the crash occurred just before
1 p.m. near the village of Cotgrave.

Police seize suspected serial killer in southern Brazil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Police in southern Brazil arrested a
Sao Paulo man suspected of terrorizing killing a series of women
here for the past eight months, authorities said Wednesday.
	   Francisco de Assis Pereira, 31, suspected of raping and killing
eight women, whose bodies were found over several months in a
thickly wooded park, was seized in Uruguaiana 930 miles (1,500 kms)
southwest of Sao Paulo, near the Argentine border.
	   Pereira was apparently hiding out in Argentina, but returned to
Brazil where he was recognized by a fisherman who reported it to
the police. The suspect was seized Tuesday night.
	   ``He didn't resist arrest and said he didn't have anything to do
with the murders,'' said Santa Catarina police Cpt. Marcos Alves de
Sousa by telephone.
	   Nine other women who were sexually assaulted in the same park
but escaped with their lives, said they were lured there by a man
claiming to be a talent scout for a modeling agency. The victims
identified Pereira from composite drawings and photographs.
	   Pereira, a motorcycle courier, was formally charged Tuesday
after police found the mangled identity card of one of his victims
in the sewer of the company where he worked.
	   The killer is believed to have last struck on July 4. The other
murders took place over six months.

German politicians urge Holocaust Memorial plans to move forward

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Leading members of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
party urged the Berlin city council Tuesday to speed approval of
plans for a national Holocaust Memorial in the city's center.
	   ``It's already late, but not too late,'' said Rita Suessmuth,
president of the lower house of parliament.
	   After more than 10 years of debate, officials hope to begin
construction of the memorial in the heart of Berlin next year, with
federal, city and private funds.
	   But the city council still must approve the plans, and Kohl must
choose a design from a group of three finalists. Kohl has promised
to name his choice before Sept. 27 national elections.
	   Whether the monument gets built at all, however, may depend on
the outcome of the election.
	   The opposition Social Democrats designated cultural affairs czar
said the party may not abide by Kohl's decision if it wins. Michael
Naumann has criticized any central memorial as too ``monumental,''
and has said he would rather see a national documentation center
about Nazi genocide and better maintenance of former concentration
camps.
	   Heiner Geissler, deputy party leader for Kohl's Christian
Democrats in parliament, also urged the Berlin council to approve
the plan, complaining that the monument had become a campaign
issue.
	   Geissler attacked Naumann's position as a ``cultural fad.'' He
said few people actually visit the camps, and that therefore a
central memorial in Berlin is needed to remember the deaths of six
million Jews during the Holocaust.

Court rules German suspect in police attack must return to jail

<TEXT>
	   DOUAI, France (AP) _ A court Wednesday ordered a German soccer
fan suspected of taking part in an attack on a French policeman
during the World Cup to go back to jail, overturning an earlier
decision freeing the young man.
	   Karl-Heinz Elschner is one of six suspects arrested in
connection with the June 21 attack on Daniel Nivel, 44, who spent
six weeks in a coma, gaining consciousness on Monday.
	   Elschner was placed under investigation for attempted homicide,
then freed June 29 after his lawyer successfully argued that
authorities may have misidentified his client.
	   In the succession of legal moves, the prosecutor's office then
appealed the decision to free Elschner, opening the way for
Wednesday's ruling.
	   The court ordered Elschner behind bars because it feared he
would not show up for an eventual hearing before the two witnesses
who identified him, according to his attorney, Eric Dupont-Moretti.
	   Dupont-Moretti contends that Elschner is the victim of a
misidentification. He has argued that two witnesses said the
suspect they saw wore a pierced earring and had a tattoo, while his
client has neither.
	   Elschner was arrested shortly after the attack on Nivel by a
group of German fans shortly after the match between Germany and
Yugoslavia in the northern city of Lens.
	   Nivel was guarding a police vehicle near the stadium at the
time. He was hit on the back of the head with an iron bar.
	   Four suspects are in custody in Germany, facing charges of joint
attempted murder and causing serious bodily harm as well as
disturbing the peace. Another suspect is being held in France.

Marred by financial woes, Gay Games put on brave face

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ The 1998 Gay Games were supposed
to be a carefree celebration of homosexuality.
	   But even before the hoopla of the opening ceremony could fade,
the director was fired for mismanagement, prompting the city of
Amsterdam to rush to the rescue with a dlrs 2.5 million loan to
ensure the Games go on.
	   ``Gay Games Committee Gets More Surprises Every Day,'' a
headline in Wednesday's daily De Volkskrant said, summing up the
confusion swirling around the quadrennial Olympics-style sports
festival.
	   ``It's kind of a dark spot on the party. It's a shame,'' said
Rudolf Steinberger, who helped organize the marathon competition.
	   It wasn't supposed to be like this.
	   Fifteen thousand athletes and 200,000-plus spectators have
flocked to Amsterdam, Europe's self-styled homosexual capital, for
some summer fun and sports.
	   But Sunday's firing of Games managing director Marc Janssens _
and the discovery of a trail of unauthorized overspending behind
him _ have overshadowed the 14-million-guilder (dlrs 7 million)
event, which began Aug. 1 and runs through Saturday.
	   Janssens, a Dutchman, was fired by the Games board of directors,
who said he ``made commitments outside the approved budget,
commitments that were also bigger than his authority.''
	   Despite more than 6 million guilders (dlrs 3 million) in
government subsidies and sponsorship money, as well as ticket sales
and merchandise revenues, the games were about 2 million guilders
(dlrs 1 million) short.
	   ``The problems were severe,'' said City Hall spokeswoman Mirjam
Otten. ``It is important for the Games to go on.''
	   To make sure they do, Amsterdam officials put up a bank
guarantee of 5 million guilders (dlrs 2.5 million) this week. KLM
Royal Dutch Airlines, a prominent Games sponsor that already had
donated 500,000 guilders (dlrs 250,000), doled out another 225,000
guilders (dlrs 112,500).
	   City officials, wary of any more misspending, have appointed
accountants to keep an eye on the books and make sure
belt-tightening is encouraged.
	   ``The situation is under control ... you can be sure that we're
not big spenders at this moment,'' said Games spokesman Paul van
Yperen as he headed for the bodybuilding arena, where dozens of
competitors were strutting their bulk.
	   Although some 30 sporting competitions and other cultural events
are offered at these Games, they have been largely eclipsed by the
financial troubles.
	   ``The 15,000 participants have trained hard for the year and put
a lot of money in what should become the experience of their
lives,'' Volkskrant said in an editorial Wednesday.
	   ``Let's hope that they will be protected from new blunders from
the organizers during the rest of the Games.''

Championship heads to quarters still searching for stars

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ No stars, no fans, no surprises.
	   The wide-open World Basketball Championship heads to the
quarterfinals without a truly dominant team or player _ and a
worrisome dearth of spectators.
	   Most of the eight teams left in the medal chase didn't practice
Wednesday, hoping to recover from the grind of six preliminary
games in seven days. Friday's quarterfinal matchups are: United
States vs. Italy, Spain vs. Greece, Lithuania vs. Russia, and
Argentina vs. Yugoslavia.
	   ``No one player is carrying this team,'' said U.S. coach Rudy
Tomjanovich, who could have been speaking about any of the title
contenders. ``If we have a lull, someone makes the big play: a
shot, a rebound, a block. But it seems to be someone different
every time.''
	   Most teams have been shuttling in at least 10 players _
Tomjanovich uses all 12 _ each game, in part because of the
physical nature of international play.
	   But it's also because no one seems to have a starting five
that's capable of controlling a game.
	   ``There are several countries that are supposed to be better
than us,'' Spanish coach Lolo Sainz said. ``But you can be certain,
certain, certain that there is no one out there that scares us.
Anyone is beatable.''
	   The closest thing to a real favorite, Yugoslavia, needed
overtime to get past Russia in preliminary round play and lost to
Italy for the first time since 1984. The U.S. grab-bag of players
from the minor league Continental Basketball Association and
European clubs lost to Lithuania and didn't lead Spain until there
were less than 2 minutes left.
	   With 2.01-meter (6-foot-7) forward Alberto Herreros pouring in a
tournament-high 20.5 points per game, Spain has looked like it
could earn its first worlds or Olympics medal since a silver at the
1984 Los Angeles Games.
	   But if a team shuts him down, there's no one else to turn to.
	   Lithuania, led by former Seton Hall standout Arturas Karnisovas,
did pull off its upset against the United States, but went down
meekly to Australia _ which didn't make the quarters _ and faded
against Spain.
	   Greece, the only country that has had a full house of spectators
each game, looked good in beating Italy, but was outclassed by both
Russia and Yugoslavia.
	   ``We are disappointed so far,'' FIBA spokesman Florian Wanninger
said of the low attendance. ``We knew in advance, and it has been
verified, that Greek people love their team but not necessarily
basketball. We have had very good games in front of 500 spectators.
That's a pity.''
	   If the hosts lose to Spain on Friday, organizers face the
serious prospect of weekend medal-round games before thousands of
empty seats at the 18,000-capacity Olympic arena.
	   Officials have blamed the absence of fans on the absence of the
Dream Team, which USA Basketball dumped in mid-June because of the
NBA labor dispute.
	   The lack of NBA players _ Yugoslavia and Lithuania are also
without theirs _ is largely responsible for the low level of play.
	   ``Maybe the Dream Team would have been blowing people out by 30,
40 or 70 points,'' said guard Jimmy Oliver, the top U.S. scorer at
14 points per game. ``There are always going to be comparisons
made, but I could care less about that stuff.''
	   He paused before adding: ``Hey, if we win the gold medal then go
ahead and compare.''

	   LONDON (AP) _ Wall Street's big drop rattled investor sentiment
around the world, sending share prices lower from Asia to Europe on
Wednesday before the New York Stock Exchange opened again and began
fluctuating sharply.
	   ``It is unpleasant and nasty _ a white-knuckle ride,'' said
Jeremy Batstone, an analyst at Natwest Stockbrokers in London.
	   Blue-chip prices were more than 2 percent lower on the London
Stock Exchange, Europe's biggest market, with similar red ink
showing up across trading screens in other key exchanges, including
Frankfurt, Paris and Milan.
	   Some analysts urged shareholders not to panic _ but all eyes
were on Wall Street's opening, which was an up-and-down affair in
the first hour.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average was up about 30 points by
midmorning after bouncing back from an earlier 75-point decline.
	   Big losses on the NYSE, where the Dow fell nearly 300 points on
Tuesday, sent shudders through smaller markets around the globe.

Sasaki sets record of 194 saves as BayStars beat Tigers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Kazuhiro Sasaki set a Japanese professional
baseball record with the 194th save of his career Wednesday as the
Central League's front-running Yokohama BayStars beat the Hanshin
Tigers 4-2 at Yokohama.
	   Sasaki, a 30-year-old right-handed reliever, held the Tigers to
one hit, two walks and no runs in the ninth inning. It was his 39th
save of the season, also a record.
	   The previous career record of 193 was set in 1984 by Yutaka
Enatsu of the Seibu Lions. Sasaki and Korean Sun Dong-yol of the
Chunichi Dragons tied last year for the old single season record of
38.
	   The BayStars are three games ahead of the second-place Chunichi
Dragons, who downed the Yakult Swallows 2-1 on Kazuki Inoue's home
run in the bottom of the 12th inning at Nagoya Dome. Inoue has
eight homers.
	   The Dragons led 1-0 on former Chicago Cubs player Leo Gomez's
one-run single in the first inning, but the Swallows tied it 1-1 in
the top of the ninth on Hatsuhiko Tsuji's RBI single.
	   At Tokyo Dome, pinch hitter Kojiro Machida doubled home two runs
with two outs in the top of 13th inning, giving the Hiroshima Toyo
Carp a 9-7 victory over the Yomiuri Giants.
	   The Giants had tied the game 7-7 on Toshihisa Nishi's three-run
home run in the bottom of the five-run ninth inning. Nishi has four
homers.
	   In the Pacific League, Jerry Brooks singled home a run and
Katsuhiro Nishiura drove in two as the front-running Nippon Ham
Fighters beat the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks 3-1 at Fukuoka Dome.
	   In the sixth inning, Nishiura drove in the tying run with a
sacrifice fly and Brooks, formerly with the Florida Marlins,
singled home the winner following a single by former Cleveland
Indians player Nigel Wilson.
	   The Fighters are 6 1/2 games ahead of the second-place Kintetsu
Buffaloes, who beat the Seibu Lions 3-2 in 12 innings.
	   Buffaloes pinch hitter Kazunori Yamamoto doubled home the
winning run in the bottom of the 12th.
	   At Chiba, Kiyoshi Hatsushiba singled home runs in the first and
third innings as the Chiba Lotte Marines edged the Orix BlueWave
2-1 in a game called with one out in the bottom of the fifth
because of torrential rains.

joint venture between the French telecom company Cegetel, the
French communications group Canal Plus, America Online and
Germany's media group Bertelsmann.
	   The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, found that the
operation will ``not create or strengthen a dominant position, nor
will it lead to anticompetitive cooperation between the parent
companies.''
	   The deal concerns the creation of a joint venture called AOL/CIS
France S.A.S. that will market, develop and provide interactive
Internet services such as chat rooms and on-line sales to
non-enterprise customers, the statement said.
	   Last June, Cegetel and Canal Plus announced an agreement to
acquire more than half the French subsidiary of America Online and
Compuserve.
	   The remaining 45 percent of America Online and Compuserve France
is owned by the U.S. parent company America Online and by
Bertelsmann.
	   The Commission can veto alliances and mergers it judges hinder
fair competition rules in the 15-nation bloc.

UN envoy extends emergency visit to Angola

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ A U.N. envoy on an emergency mission to
Angola on Wednesday postponed his departure for three days to give
himself more time to help shore up the country's fragile peace
process.
	   Sent by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Lakhdar Brahimi
arrived in Angola last Friday following the sudden escalation of
tension with the recent massacre of 100 civilians in a remote
village and reported military buildup on both sides. He had been
scheduled to leave Wednesday.
	   ``The extension of Brahimi's stay is evidence of the
secretary-general's interest in Angola's peace process,'' U.S.
Ambassador Donald Steinberg said.
	   About 500,000 people died in Angola's two-decade-long civil war
before a U.N.-brokered deal in 1994 established a tenuous peace
between government troops and those of the UNITA rebel group.
	   Implementation of the accord has been hit by delays, including
UNITA's refusal to relinquish control of its four last remaining
rural strongholds.
	   Few details were given about Brahimi's extended agenda, or
whether he would meet again with President Eduardo Dos Santos and
UNITA chief Jonas Savimbi.
	   Of his first meeting with Dos Santos, Brahimi said: ``The
president promised to end the government's hostile propaganda''
against UNITA.
	   Savimbi, meanwhile, ``promised to send his political
representatives back to Luanda before Saturday'' he added. UNITA
formally reopened its offices in Luanda in early June but its
leaders remain in the movement's highland strongholds.
	   Brahimi is scheduled to meet with Deputy Foreign Minister Joao
Bernardo Miranda and Cardinal Alexandre do Nascimento, Luanda's
Archbishop, on Wednesday.
	   He said he would give a press conference Saturday before
departing for Namibia to meet with President Sam Nujoma. In July
Nujoma and Dos Santos agreed on a ``security pact'' to contain
UNITA.
	   Ambassador Steinberg confirmed that the U.N. Security Council in
New York would discuss Angola on Friday.
	   The United States, Portugal and Russia make up the so-called
``troika'' of states overseeing the Angolan peace process.
	   During his stay, Brahimi has also been gathering information to
help the U.N. chose a permanent representative for Angola to
succeed Alioune Blondin Beye, a key player in the 1994 accord, who
died in a June plane crash in the Ivory Coast.

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ An Albanian junior soccer team that
participated in the Helsinki Cup youth tournament in July has
requested asylum in Finland, reports said Wednesday.
	   National radio YLE said the 23-member is awaiting immigration
authorities' decision at an immigration center in Oulu, about 600
kilometers (400 miles) north of Helsinki.
	   The coach of the team, Fatmir Tarja, was quoted by YLE as saying
the application had been planned in advance, and that they didn't
specifically select Finland as their destination, but any country
safer than Albania.
	   According to the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, the players'
parents remain in Albania, but would be eligible to immigrate if
their children are granted asylum.
	   Immigration officials declined to comment on the reports to The
Associated Press.

<TEXT>
	   GISENYI, Rwanda (AP) _ Government-controlled Radio Rwanda said
Wednesday the eastern Congolese towns of Goma and Bukavu were in
the hands of rebels opposed to President Laurent Kabila.
	   The private Rwandan News Agency said, however, that fighting
continued in Uvira, 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of Bukavu at
the head of Lake Tanganyika.
	   Air workers in Uvira reported hearing heavy artillery fire and
mortar explosions Tuesday night and Wednesday, but said the center
of town, controlled by government forces, was calm.
	   RNA also said the rebels elected Arthur Zahidi Ngoma _ ``a
well-known staunch opponent (of Kabila)'' _ as their leader.
	   The agency said in an interview with a radio station in Goma,
Ngoma denied the rebellion was based on ethnicity or backed by
Rwanda.
	   ``This is not a struggle of the Banyamulenge (ethnic Tutsis in
eastern Congo). It is a struggle of the Congolese people,'' Ngoma
said. ``Neither is it a struggle of Rwandans.''
	   A Rwandan security official, who asked not to be further
identified, said Kabila's foreign minister, Bizima Karaha, an
ethnic Tutsi from eastern Congo, had arrived in Goma, apparently to
take up sides with the rebels.
	   Rwanda has closed its border with Congo, and attempts by
reporters to cross over to Goma were fruitless.
	   Kabila accuses Rwanda of being behind attempts to oust him and
to sow chaos in the eastern part of the vast Democratic Repbublic
of Congo.
	   The Rwandan government denies any role in the eastern rebellion
or in revolts by Banyamulenge soldiers in the Congolese capital,
Kinshasa, but various officials have said they are not suprised by
the turn of events.
	   Humanitarian sources have reported significant movement of
Rwandan troops in North Kivu province around Beni, Butembo and
Rutshuru and Goma and in Bukavu in South Kivu province.
	   A dozen U.S. military personnel in camouflage uniforms were seen
at the Gisenyi border post between Rwanda and Congo Wednesday
morning.
	   A spokesman for the U.S. Army's European Command in Stuttgart,
Germany, said the men were the Rwanda Interagency Assessment Team
that has been in the country for about 10 days and will stay
another 10 days to two weeks.
	   ``Yes, we do have soldiers there, approximately 12, that make up
the RIAT assessment team. They were in the vicinity of Gisenyi.
They are now en route to Kigali (the Rwandan capital),'' said Maj.
Henry L. Huntley.
	   But the Rwandan security official said the U.S. military
personnel had crossed into Goma accompanied by Rwandan army
officers and had not returned by 5 p.m. (1400gmt).
	   The official also said the Rwandans were expecting Kabila's
forces to bomb Goma or Gisenyi or both.
	   The U.S. military spokesman said the team's mission was to
``assess the current military situation in Rwanda and to determine
the Rwandan military capability to deter, contain or minimize the
threat of insurgency and genocidal acts.''
	   Huntley said the team was in Rwanda in response to President
Bill Clinton's April 1998 pledge in Kigali ``to do all that the
U.S. government could do to counter a resurgence of genocide.''
	   In 1994, at least half a million people, most of them minority
Tutsis, were killed in Rwanda in a Hutu government-orchestrated
genocide that lasted for three months until Tutsi rebels overthrew
the government and stopped the killing.
	   The government is now fighting Hutu rebels who attack Rwanda
from bases in eastern Congo.
	   RNA also said members of the rebel alliance that had brought
Kabila to power in May 1997 accused him of ``making freedom
fighters, senior politicians and army commanders regret their
contribution to the liberation war.''

Two Jewish settlers killed, right-wing calls for halt in talks

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fresh Netanyahu comments &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ITZHAR, West Bank (AP) _ Two Israeli settlers were ambushed and
killed as they patrolled an isolated Jewish settlement in the West
Bank early Wednesday, prompting right-wing calls for a suspension
of talks with Palestinians.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed the shooting with
his 12-member security Cabinet on Wednesday amid calls that he
freeze negotiations until the Palestinians handed over the
attackers.
	   Israeli radio reports said Netanyahu had promised settlers to
expand Itzhar, the settlement where the shootings occurred. The few
hundred residents of the settlement, built on an isolated hilltop
surrounded by Palestinian villages, are zealously committed to
keeping biblical Israel _ including the West Bank _ in Jewish
hands.
	   There were calls for revenge Wednesday afternoon at a memorial
service in Jerusalem attended by hundreds of mourners.
	   ``How many can they kill and we'll keep sitting quietly?''
shouted one woman, Yaffa Cohen. ``An eye for an eye. One day Jewish
terrorists will rise and kill Arabs.''
	   ``We will build this land. We will keep this land. And we won't
turn it over to the hands of murderers,'' said Shaul Yaalom, a
legislator from the pro-settler National Religious Party, a partner
in Netanyahu's ruling coalition.
	   Netanyahu said he believed that the gunmen came from
``Palestinian-controlled areas,'' but added that that hadn't been
confirmed.
	   ``I think this was a very very serious crime and it underscores
our concerns regarding security and it also reaffirms our
insistence that the Palestinian Authority stick to its obligations,
which means fighting terrorism.''

British runner cleared in drug case to compete at Commonwealth
</HEADLINE>
Games

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ English 400-meter runner Solomon Wariso was
cleared Wednesday to compete at the Commonwealth Games after
winning his appeal against a drug ban.
	   Wariso served a three-month ban in 1994 after testing positive
for ephedrine _ contained in a product called ``Up Your Gas'' _ at
the European Championships. He was sent home from the championships
after the positive test.
	   Under England's Commonwealth Games policy, any drug ban produces
an automatic life ban from the games.
	   However, England's Commonwealth Games panel ruled Wednesday that
Wariso's offense was a ``minor breach'' and lifted the ban.
	   Panel chairman Jeff Cook said Wariso made a genuine mistake and
was sorry for what happended.
	   ``From what we understand he bought a can of drink in the United
States called Up Your Gas, not realizing it contained the Ephedrine
derivative,'' he said. ``However we are now satisfied that he has
served his ban and that he won't be doing it again.
	   ``In fact he is now so insecure about banned substances that he
won't even drink an open can of liquid or accept anything from
anybody else until he is satisfied it is clean.''
	   Wariso was a controversial selection for the European
Championships and the Commonwealth Games after beating former
British team captain and Olympic silver medalist Roger Black for
third place at the trials in Birmingham two weeks ago.
	   Wariso, a 200-meter runner who said he entered the 400 meters
for ``a laugh,'' finished fractionally ahead of Black, leaving the
third 400 meter spot on the team to the selectors' discretion.
	   Black was bypassed by the selectors and retired from top-flight
competition last Sunday.
	   Wariso was in Stockholm for the DN Gala meet Wednesday and was
represented at the hearing by his coach Michael Bruce.

Government announces bright economic forecast for 1999
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukraine plans to achieve 0.5 percent
economic growth this year and increase it to 2 percent of gross
domestic product in 1999, a senior government official said
Wednesday.
	   Deputy Economy Minister Ihor Shumylo said the government plans
to decrease the budget deficit to 1.5 percent of GDP in 1999, down
from about 2.5 percent forecast for this year.
	   Inflation next year is to be reduced to 7 percent, from about 12
percent expected for 1998, he said.
	   Shumylo said the forecast figures are to be used as a basis for
preparing the 1999 budget and the government's economic reform
program for next year.
	   Ukraine's economy has been steadily declining since independence
in 1991, and the country has been slow to implement the structural
reforms needed to attract investment and spark economic growth.
	   But Shumylo said the Cabinet's positive economic development
forecast for 1999 stems from a series of economic reform measures
the government took recently to secure a large loan from the
International Monetary Fund.
	   He said the measures approved would be further intensified next
year by significantly reducing major tax rates, reforming the
banking sector and attracting more domestic and foreign investment
in the economy.
	   The government plans to attract about dlrs 650 million in direct
foreign investment this year, up from dlrs 615 million in 1997, and
bring the figure to dlrs 750 million in 1999.
	   Shumylo said the government's recent decisions, which led to the
IMF's agreement to consider approval of a dlrs 2.5 billion loan,
averted serious economic difficulties for the near future, but that
Ukraine's massive foreign debt can immediately translate into a
crisis if the government's reforms slow down.
	   ``The threat of a financial crisis will loom over Ukraine for at
least another three years because of debts we've incurred before,''
Shumylo said.
	   Ukraine's foreign debt has increased by over dlrs 6 billion to
dlrs 18 billion since last year because of massive borrowing
programs the government undertook to finance the budget deficit and
offset poor collection of budget revenues.

Congo crisis to be discussed by region Friday at Victoria Falls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The government said Wednesday it will
host a regional summit on Friday to discuss the crisis in Congo.
	   George Chiramba, President Robert Mugabe's press secretary, said
the summit was proposed last week by Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni at a regional economic meeting in Namibia.
	   Chiramba said so far the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda,
Zambia, Namibia and Uganda have indicated they will send
representatives to the meeeting.
	   A South African foreign affairs spokesman said he knew of no
invitation to attend the summit.
	   Mubabe, who will host the summit, is the chairman of the
Southern Africa Development Community's committee on politics,
defense and security.
	   Chiramba said it was possible that the threat of a return to
civil war in Angola also could be discussed at the summit.
	   On Wednesday, Congo President Laurent Kabila accused Rwanda of
sending troops to help a Tutsi-led rebellion in eastern Congo,
where rebels reportedly captured two key cities. Rwanda denies
involvement.
	   On Congo's southern border, Zambia closed the Mokambo border
post on Tuesday after fighting broke out between Congo government
forces and the Banyamulenge rebels _ members of an ethnic group
with close ties to Rwanda.
	   Martin Bucumi, an official with the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees in Zambia, said small numbers of refugees
from the fighting in both Congo and Angolo have arrived in Zambia.

July's inflation rate in Ukraine reported at minus 0.9 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Consumer prices in Ukraine decreased last
month, providing for an inflation rate of minus 0.9 percent in
July, a government official said Wednesday.
	   Inflation for the first six months of 1998 was 3 percent and the
government expects annual inflation in 1998 to be lower than 12
percent, Deputy Economy Minister Ihor Shumylo said.
	   July's deflation was caused primarily by a seasonal decrease in
the prices of food products, according to the State Statistics
Committee.
	   The highest monthly inflation this year was 1.3 percent in
January and April, while the government reported zero inflation in
May and June.
	   Inflation in the former Soviet republic has declined steadily
since reaching more than 10,000 percent in 1993, and the annual
rate dropped to about 10 percent in 1997.

Albanian power reduced after fire damaged transformer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albanians are being forced to reduce
their energy consumption by 23 percent, after a fire damaged the
country's main power plant, authorities said Wednesday.
	   Damage caused by a major fire in the country's main power
transformer Saturday caused the state-run Albanian Energy
Corporation to cut available energy by 2.5 million kilowatt-hours
per day.
	   The energy corporation will be rationing the supply of
electricity to each household, and also regulating consumption in
the economic sector for more than a month. The shortages has forced
the country's three most important factories to temporarily shut
down.
	   To help ease the crisis, in the next few days Albania will
import energy from its neighbors Bulgaria and Greece. Authorities
expect the transformer, located in the city of Fierza, 80
kilometers (65 miles) north of Tirana, to be functioning normally
again by the end of the week.

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Both crew members were killed when a
civilian helicopter crashed in Meloey, some 30 miles (50
kilometers) south of the town of Bodoe on Wednesday.
	   When police arrived at the scene 20 minutes after the crash, the
Bell 214 helicopter was burning and the two aboard were already
dead.
	   The cause of the accident was not immediately known, but a
sliced cable was found near the wreck. The helicopter apparently
flew into an aerial cable used for transport of goods and hay.
	   The civilian helicopter was on its way to a lifting job in the
town of Glomfjord when it crashed.

reform &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Opposition chancellor candidate Gerhard
Schroeder said Wednesday that he could work with Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's party on tax reform and even hinted he might accept them as
a coalition partner.
	   Schroeder, who is leading Kohl in opinion polls ahead of the
Sept. 27 national elections, said he would cooperate with Kohl's
Christian Democrats on tax reform even if they become the new
opposition.
	   Schroeder's Social Democrats last year blocked Kohl's plan to
cut the rate of private income taxation to between 15 percent and
39 percent from a current range of 26 percent to 53 percent. The
party said Kohl's plan was too generous to the well-off and would
create new budget holes.
	   Schroeder said in an interview with the weekly Die Zeit that his
party would take another crack at tax reform if elected, saying the
tax code needs to be simplified and tax breaks minimized.
	   The candidate also raised the possibility of direct cooperation
with Kohl allies in a so-called ``grand coalition'' government, if
no bloc of parties wins a substantial majority.
	   But Schroeder's singling-out of one of Kohl's ministers as a man
he could work with was not welcomed by Kohl allies.
	   Schroeder said he would rather work with Defense Minister Volker
Ruehe than with Wolfgang Schaeuble, the Christian Democrats' leader
in parliament.
	   Ruehe called Schroeder's statement a ``red herring.''
	   In an interview for Thursday's Bild newspaper, Ruehe said
Schroeder was trying to to divert voters' attention from his true
intention to rule in a coalition with the environmentalist Greens
party.
	   The Greens have seen their support decline since they called in
March for a tripling of gasoline prices to discourage auto use _ a
proposal Schroeder has rejected.

Iraq reportedly asks Egypt to restore diplomatic ties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iraq has asked Egypt to restore diplomatic
relations with it, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported
Wednesday.
	   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz made the request in a
meeting with Egypt's chief representative in Baghdad, Mahmoud
Sharif Rihan, MENA said.
	   Egyptian Foreign Ministry officials could not be reached
immediately for comment.
	   Aziz said the recent improvement of ties between the two
countries required a further push, MENA quoted Rihan as saying.
	   Rihan, who runs an Egyptian interest section at the Indian
Embassy in Baghdad, did not say when the meeting was held.
	   Arab diplomats in Cairo said Iraq's envoy to the Arab League,
Nabil Najim, put the same request to Egyptian Deputy Foreign
Minister Seyed Abu Zaid in Cairo on Wednesday.
	   Iraq severed diplomatic ties with Egypt and several other Arab
countries before the start of the 1991 Gulf War in protest against
their participation in the U.S-led coalition forces that liberated
Kuwait from Iraqi occupation.
	   The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Iraq has
made a similar request to Syria.
	   Iraq and Syria cut relations when Syria sided with Iran after
the start of the Iran-Iraq war in 1980-88.
	   Egypt and Syria have improved their relations with Iraq in
recent months as both nations increased their trade with Baghdad
under the oil-for-food deal. The U.N. program allows Iraq to bypass
the sanctions imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait and sell
limited quantities of oil to buy humanitarian goods for its people.
	   Egyptian Trade Minister Ahmed Gweily was quoted in Cairo
newspapers on Wednesday as saying that Egyptian companies have
signed deals worth more than dlrs 200 million with Iraq this year.
	   Egypt's Health Minister and Trade Minister have both visited
Baghdad this year.

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ A pair of strong earthquakes on Ecuador's
Pacific coast toppled buildings and killed three people, and
military planes were flying food and supplies Wednesday to hundreds
of people left homeless.
	   President Fabian Alarcon declared a ``yellow alert'' in the
coastal province of Manabi, ordering rescue workers to prepare
shelters in schools and hospitals in case of more tremors.
	   The twin quakes struck Tuesday afternoon near the resort town of
Bahia de Caraquez, 130 miles (220 kms) southwest of Quito, causing
200 houses and buildings to collapse, civil defense officials and
police reported.
	   At least 30 tremors followed the two quakes, forcing hundreds of
fearful residents to spend the night on soccer fields or in parks.
	   One woman died of a heart attack during the panic, and a young
girl and a woman were killed by falling walls when their houses
collapsed in different towns across Manabi, a police report said.
	   Local hospitals reported treating 20 injured people.
	   Television channels showed a nervous President Alarcon on
Tuesday holding onto a table while a quake shook the governor's
palace in Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city, where he was attending
a state function.
	   The quake was also felt in Quito 130 miles (220 kms) away where
office towers swayed and workers ran out to the streets.
	   The first quake struck with a magnitude of 5.7, according to
Ecuador's Geophysical Institute.
	   The second struck more than an hour later with a magnitude of
7.1, according to the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colorado.
	   The earthquake was the largest in the area since a 7.8 magnitude
earthquake on Jan. 19, 1958, the institute said.

Arbitration panel to rule on disputes at Commonwealth Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ A special arbitration panel will
rule on any doping controversies or other disputes at the
Commonwealth Games in Malaysia.
	   The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) said Wednesday it will
set up a special ad-hoc division in Kuala Lumpur for the Sept.
11-21 games, just as it did for the 1996 summer Olympics in Atlanta
and 1998 winter Olympics in Nagano.
	   Every athlete who signs an entry form for the Commonwealth Games
agrees to submit any dispute to the arbitration panel.
	   Cases will be heard by three arbitrators, who call a hearing at
short notice and issue a ruling within 24 hours.
	   The president of the panel in Kuala Lumpur will be Judge
Raghunandan S. Pathak, the former Chief Justice of India and a
former judge at the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
	   The six arbitrators on call to hear cases will be Judge Bola
Ajibola of Nigeria, Michael Beloff of England, Timothy Castle of
New Zealand, Judge Robert Ellicott of Australia, Judge Hugh Fraser
of Canada and Thomas Lee of Malaysia.

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ A mine shaft collapsed in northern
Moravia, killing one man and trapping four others early Wednesday,
CTK news agency reported.
	   All five men were trapped 750 meters (yards) underground when a

kilometers (225 miles) east of Prague. Rescue workers were able to
save four of the men, but the fifth died while underground.
	   Specialists are examining the site, but no causes were

German politicians urge Holocaust Memorial plans to move forward

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Leading members of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
party urged the Berlin city council Wednesday to speed approval of
plans for a national Holocaust Memorial in the city's center.
	   ``It's already late, but not too late,'' said Rita Suessmuth,
president of the lower house of parliament.
	   After more than 10 years of debate, officials hope to begin
construction of the memorial in the heart of Berlin next year, with
federal, city and private funds.
	   Kohl is one of the monument's strongest backers, but the final
plans must also be approved by the city, where some officials have
voiced reservations about it. Project backers have yet to select a
winning design from a group of three finalists, although Kohl has
promised a decision before Sept. 27 national elections.
	   Whether the monument gets built at all, however, may depend on
the outcome of the election.
	   The opposition Social Democrats designated cultural affairs czar
said the party may not abide by Kohl's decision if it wins. Michael
Naumann has criticized any central memorial as too ``monumental,''
and has said he would rather see a national documentation center
about Nazi genocide and better maintenance of former concentration
camps.
	   Heiner Geissler, deputy party leader for Kohl's Christian
Democrats in parliament, also urged the Berlin council to approve
the plan, complaining that the monument had become a campaign
issue.
	   Geissler attacked Naumann's position as a ``cultural fad.'' He
said few people actually visit the camps, and that therefore a
central memorial in Berlin is needed to remember the deaths of six
million Jews during the Holocaust.

Zurich launches campaign to locate Holocaust policy holders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS comment from spokeswoman in 5th, 10th grafs. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ A leading Swiss insurer on Wednesday
launched a U.S. advertising campaign to locate Holocaust survivors
and heirs who could be beneficiaries of its life insurance
policies.
	   Zurich Insurance Co. said its advertisement, headed ``A Message
From Zurich Insurance To Holocaust Survivors And Heirs,'' will
appear starting Thursday in 10 U.S. newspapers.
	   They include The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Los
Angeles Times and The Miami Herald.
	   ``We believe it is our corporate responsibility to reach out to
the Jewish community in this fashion in order to increase the
opportunity for anyone who believes they may be a beneficiary of a
Zurich policy to come forward,'' chairman Rolf Hueppi said in a
statement.
	   To date, the company hasn't located any Holocaust survivors or
heirs who may be beneficiaries of such a policy, spokeswoman Iris
Roth said.
	   Zurich is one of four European insurance companies that in April
reached agreement with California Insurance Commissioner Chuck
Quackenbush and New York State Insurance Commissioner Neil D. Levin
to form an international commission that will ensure insurance
claims are paid.
	   Also in April, it set up its own ``international commission of
eminent persons'' to review disputed life insurance claims arising
from the Holocaust era.
	   Zurich, then operating as Vita Life, had ``a small insurance
portfolio in various European countries'' before and during World
War II, the advertisement said.
	   ``At all relevant times, Zurich held a minor market position in
Germany and German-occupied territories,'' it added.
	   Zurich then specialized in property and casualty, not life
insurance, Roth said.
	   The firm said that inquiries, either direct to the insurer or
via state insurance commissioners' offices, ``will be handled with
expediency, understanding and compassion.''

Workers trapped as apartment building collapses in Spain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VALENCIA, Spain (AP) _ An abandoned three-story apartment
building in the old quarter of Valencia collapsed Wednesday
trapping four workers that had been carrying out restoration work,
rescue services said.
	   Three other workers were hospitalized with minor injuries after
building collapsed, according to Laura Navarro, spokeswoman for the
regional government's rescue services.
	   A Valencia town hall spokesman said 10 laborers were on the site
when the building came crashing down in Spain's third largest city.
The rescue services said they could not confirm the figure.
	   Of the four men trapped, two have been located amongst the
rubble but two have yet to be found, spokeswoman Laura Navarro
said.
	   The cause of the collapse was not immediately known.

Pet bird's dirty mouth a likely shock for thief who stole him
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CALNE, England (AP) _ A pet bird stolen from a pensioner's home
just might make the thief who took him blush.
	   Harry the cockatoo, you see, learned to speak while his previous
owner was serving in the merchant navy.
	   ``Harry speaks quite fluently, and he swears a lot,'' said Rod
Saye, who gave the bird to his 86-year-old mother Alma. ``I think
the thieves might have a difficult job selling him because of his
swearing and he has pulled all the feathers out on his chest so he
looks quite unusual.''
	   Mrs. Saye, who is hard of hearing, has learned to ignore the
30-year-old bird's swearing and will turn down her hearing aid if
the language gets too tough.
	   ``My mother is absolutely devastated by the theft _ she was in
floods of tears,'' Saye said. ``It is her 87th birthday on Friday
and it's not a very nice present for her to lose her pet like
this.''
	   Harry is believed to be worth up to 500 pounds (dlrs 800 dlrs).
	   ``The thieves may get a shock when Harry gives his own opinion
on being stolen,'' said a police spokesman in Calne, about 65 miles
(105 kms) west of London.

Liverpool legend joins management ranks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WREXHAM, England (AP) _ Former Liverpool star Ian Rush took his
first step into management Wednesday by signing a one-year contract
to become player-coach at second division side Wrexham.
	   The 36-year-old former Welsh international striker played 16
seasons for Liverpool before moving to Leeds United in 1995-96.
	   Rush had stints with three clubs, including Leeds, Newcastle and
Sheffield United, last season but ensured his stability this season
by linking with Wrexham.
	   Rush said the Wrexham deal was his first move into a career as a
soccer manager.
	   ``It is something I have always wanted to do,'' he said. ``Money
was not important, I had offers from Japan and Europe but I like
the set-up at Wrexham and I can learn the coaching trade,'' he
said.
	   Rush was the Professional Footballers' Assocation player of the
year in 1984. He was named among the 100 ``legends'' of the English
league's 100-year history in a list released Tuesday.

Arafat presents new cabinet, but most ministers keep jobs

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
announced a new Cabinet on Wednesday, a year after legislators
demanded the old one be dissolved because of widespread corruption.
	   But all of the ministers accused of corruption kept their jobs _
raising skepticism about Arafat's pledge of ``accountability and
transparency'' in all government institutions.
	   ``It's a big disappointment,'' said Ziad Abu Amr, an independent
legislator from the Gaza Strip. ``We still have the old government.
We have no change.''
	   Despite opposition from legislators such as Abu Amr, the new
Cabinet is expected to be approved when it comes up for a vote
Saturday in the Legislative Council, which is dominated by Arafat's
Fatah faction.
	   The council voted 57-1 last year to demand that Arafat dissolve
the Cabinet after a legislative committee report found extensive
abuses in all government ministries and recommended that three
ministers _ Planning Minister Nabil Shaath, Civil Affairs Minister
Jamil Tarifi, and Transportation Minister Ali Qawasmeh _ be put on
trial.
	   The three ministers, who denied any wrongdoing, all retained
their jobs in Arafat's new Cabinet.
	   The committee report followed a government audit that found
nearly half of the Palestinian Authority's dlrs 800 million annual
budget had been squandered through corruption and mismanagement.
	   Despite repeated promises, Arafat put off any action for months,
until the Legislative Council threatened to hold a vote of
no-confidence in his government.
	   On Wednesday, Arafat appeared before a council meeting in the
West Bank town of Ramallah and announced a new Cabinet that
included all but one of the old ministers, as well as 10 new faces.
All but one of the new ministers are Fatah members.
	   Arafat retained control of the Interior Ministry, which controls
the Palestinian security forces, and took over the Education
Ministry from Yasser Amro.
	   Arafat announced the creation of three new ministries:
environment, parliamentary affairs, and prisoner affairs. The
official Palestinian Authority newspaper, Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, said
a ministry of Israeli settlement affairs would also be established,
headed by legislator Salah Tamari.
	   Jerusalem legislator Ziad Abu Zayyad was named a minister, in a
direct slight to Faisal Husseini, the top PLO official in
Jerusalem, who has played the role of minister in charge of
Jerusalem affairs.
	   Abu Zayyad's portfolio was not announced, but Palestinian
reports have said that Arafat wanted to replace Husseini. Husseini
has been critical of the Palestinian Authority for failing to act
aggressively enough on behalf of Palestinian claims to the disputed
city.
	   In his speech to the council, Arafat said there had been
``constant improvement in all of the Palestinian Authority
ministries and institutions. There is more awareness of law and
order and the interests of the people and the homeland.''
	   Arafat said the government's platform was ``to continue building
Palestinian institutions and to reinforce law and order and the
foundations of an independent judiciary, human rights, pluralism,
accountability and transparency in all institutions of the
Palestinian Authority.''

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ The 1998 Gay Games were supposed
to be a carefree celebration of homosexuality.
	   But even before the hoopla of the opening ceremony could fade,
the director was fired for mismanagement. Then the city of
Amsterdam rushed to the rescue with a dlrs 2.5 million loan to
ensure the Games go on.
	   Now Games organizers have had to tap a government-funded agency
for help to pay athletes from developing countries the cash they
were promised for food and other necessities.
	   ``Gay Games Committee Gets More Surprises Every Day,'' a
headline in Wednesday's daily De Volkskrant said, summing up the
confusion swirling around the quadrennial Olympics-style sports
festival.
	   ``It's kind of a dark spot on the party. It's a shame,'' said
Rudolf Steinberger, who helped organize the marathon competition.
	   It wasn't supposed to be like this.
	   Fifteen thousand athletes and 200,000-plus spectators have
flocked to Amsterdam, Europe's self-styled homosexual capital, for
some summer fun and sports.
	   But Sunday's firing of Games managing director Marc Janssens _
and the discovery of a trail of unauthorized overspending behind
him _ have overshadowed the 14-million-guilder (dlrs 7 million)
event, which began Aug. 1 and runs through Saturday.
	   Janssens, a Dutchman, was fired by the Games board of directors,
who said he ``made commitments outside the approved budget,
commitments that were also bigger than his authority.''
	   Despite more than 6 million guilders (dlrs 3 million) in
government subsidies and sponsorship money, as well as ticket sales
and merchandise revenues, the games were about 2 million guilders
(dlrs 1 million) short.
	   ``The problems were severe,'' said City Hall spokeswoman Mirjam
Otten. ``It is important for the Games to go on.''
	   To make sure they do, Amsterdam officials put up a bank
guarantee of 5 million guilders (dlrs 2.5 million) this week. KLM
Royal Dutch Airlines, a prominent Games sponsor that already had
donated 500,000 guilders (dlrs 250,000), doled out another 225,000
guilders (dlrs 112,500).
	   A publicly funded development agency is now helping the Games
pay up to 300 participants from Africa and Latin America the
allowance of 400 guilders (dlrs 200) they were promised for the
week. Some had only received half, the Amsterdam daily Het Parool
reported Wednesday.
	   City officials, wary of any more misspending, have appointed
accountants to keep an eye on the books and make sure
belt-tightening is encouraged.
	   ``The situation is under control ... you can be sure that we're
not big spenders at this moment,'' said Games spokesman Paul van
Yperen as he headed for the bodybuilding arena, where dozens of
oiled competitors were strutting their bulk.
	   Although some 30 sporting competitions and other cultural events
are offered at these Games, they have been largely eclipsed by the
financial troubles.
	   ``The 15,000 participants have trained hard for the year and put
a lot of money in what should become the experience of their
lives,'' Volkskrant said in an editorial Wednesday.
	   ``Let's hope that they will be protected from new blunders from
the organizers during the rest of the Games.''

	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ West African diplomats are debating
proposals to send peacekeepers to Guinea-Bissau, where a two-month
military uprising has persisted despite numerous mediation efforts.
	   Foreign ministers and ambassadors of seven countries in the
Economic Community of West African States began meeting in Ghana's
capital on Tuesday to discuss the crisis, ECOWAS official Roger
Laloupo said.
	   ECOWAS is aiming to reinforce the government of President Joao
Bernardo Vieira through negotiations, sanctions or the use of force
to bring peace to the tiny former Portuguese colony on Africa's
western edge, Laloupo said.
	   The seven countries involved in the meetings are Ghana, Ivory
Coast, Gambia, Republic of Guinea, Senegal, Nigeria and Burkina
Faso.
	   Nigeria's new military ruler Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar has
proposed sending an intervention force to Guinea-Bissau similar to
those already in Liberia and Sierra Leone.
	   Nigerian soldiers lead those forces, which allowed peaceful
elections to be held in Liberia last year and reinstated Sierra
Leone's President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah through military might in
March.
	   Fighting in Guinea-Bissau began in early June after former
military leader Brig. Ansumane Mane led soldiers in a revolt
against the government. The latest round of negotiations between
the battling sides are due to occur next weekend on a Portuguese
ship anchored off the coast.
	   -----
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau has begun procedures to
replace its ambassador to Portugal, news reports said Wednesday.
	   The tiny former Portuguese colony in West Africa is currently
submerged in a political crisis stemming from a military rebellion
on June 7.
	   Adelino Manu Keta, 58, is the chosen substitute for current
ambassador, Jose Pereira Baptista, the Portuguese news agency Lusa
quoted Foreign Ministry sources as saying.
	   Baptista took over the Lisbon posting from Keta who had
previously served as ambassador to Portugal between 1992 and 1996.
	   Keta was Guinea-Bissau's ambassador to China when the current
crisis broke.
	   Portugal is a key member of the delegation of
Portuguese-speaking countries that brokered a cease-fire deal on
Jul. 26th. The delegation is due to mediate a second round of talks
Aug 7 and 8.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) - Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat will meet with President Nelson Mandela and address
Parliament on his first state visit to South Africa next week,
foreign affairs officials said on Wednesday.
	   Arafat will arrive either late on August 10 or early August 11
and leave on August 13. He will address a joint-sitting of both
houses of South Africa's parliament on August 12, said foreign
affairs spokesman Machiel van Niekerk.
	   Aside from visiting Robben Island, where Mandela was jailed
during white minority rule, Arafat will also hold talks with
Mandela's heir apparent Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.
	   Arafat will also speak at the Institute of International Affairs
in Pretoria and sign a declaration of intent on health and
education co-operation.
	   South Africa formally recognized Palestine by establishing
diplomatic relations in 1995 and has criticized Israel's hardline
policies for damaging the ailing Middle East peace process.
	   -----
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ The United Nations refugee agency has
begun relocating 5,000 sick and hungry Sierra Leonean refugees from
a camp in an isolated Liberian border town to another closer to
Liberia's capital.
	   A United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees statement issued
Tuesday said the decision was taken after an assessment team, which
was not named, had found them living in appalling conditions.
	   Newspapers in Liberia have reported that about 55,000 Sierra
Leoneans are facing starvation and illness in camps in Liberia's
northern Vahun district bordering Sierra Leone.
	   Refugees would be transferred to the town of Sinje, 80
kilometers (50 miles) away from Monrovia where the UNHCR already
has a large operation. There, they will be given food and
medication and better access to clean drinking water and
sanitation.
	   About 650 refugees, mostly women and children, had already been
transferred to Sinje and the relocation was continuing without
problems, the statement said.
	   The refugees fled clashes between West African peacekeepers and
remnants of Sierra Leone's ousted military junta who have been
terrorizing villages since they were ousted in March.
	   -----
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ United States Special Forces are
training southern African troops on disaster management and relief
in a four-week long course.
	   The students will include soldiers from Southern African
Development Community countries including Botswana, Lesotho,
Malawi, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe, said Zimbabwe
National Army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Richard Parwana.
	   The course will also include middle level managers from civil
protection and non-governmental organizations, including the Harare
Fire Brigade and commercial corporations, he said.
	   -----
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Maj. Gen. Salim Saleh, the only brother
of President Yoweri Museveni, has turned down a Cabinet-level post,
saying the appointment might be interpreted as nepotism, a
newspaper said Wednesday.
	   ``Given the mentality of our society, people will view my
ministerial appointment as nepotism because of blood relationship I
have with the president,'' the government-owned New Vision quoted
Saleh as telling Museveni.
	   The newspaper reported unidentified sources as saying Saleh was
also of the opinion most Ugandans prefer cabinet ministers who have
high academic qualifications, which he lacks.
	   Saleh, whose real name is Caleb Akandwanaho, fought alongside
Museveni in his five-year bush war which brought his brother to
power in early 1986.
	   Last week, Museveni named Saleh, whose previous job had been
described as ``overseer in the defense ministry,'' to an
unspecified Cabinet post.
	   He also named another unspecified Cabinet official and 14 junior
officials.
	   Parliament initially opposed the appointments on the grounds the
cabinet was already too big and those named were unrepresentative.
	   Museveni later convinced the legislators to change their minds.

Five bodies found in destroyed apartment building in Berlin

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fifth body found; two people still missing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Rescuers recovered five bodies Wednesday from a
Berlin apartment building demolished a day earlier by a natural gas
explosion.
	   Hundreds of police and firefighters working with dogs and heat
and sound sensors continued to search for two residents still
missing, said police spokesman Horst Brandt. Workers used a crane,
bulldozer and other heavy equipment to dig through the rubble.
	   Hopes were raised that rescuers would find 13-year-old Sven
Tornow alive after his small, white dog was rescued unharmed.
However, the boy's was one of the five bodies recovered, along with
two elderly women, a 70-year-old man, and another man found lying
on a sofa.
	   The boy was home alone when the early morning blast collapsed
the four-story apartment building, ripping it off its foundation
and sending a huge cloud of dust over the Steglitz neighborhood.
	   His father was at work and his mother already in a new apartment
that the family planned to move into on Friday.
	   Fire chief Alfred Broemme blamed natural gas for the explosion.
However, police were still investigating the cause.

Ludmila Engquist drops out for rest of season
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ World champion hurdler Ludmila Engquist
said Wednesday she is withdrawing for the rest of the season,
citing problems with her left leg.
	   Engquist, who won at last year's world championships in Athens
and also was a 1996 Olympic gold medalist, strained leg muscles
while training in June, then hurt her left hamstring in late July.
	   The latter injury ''caused a lot of pain when I came down from
the hurdles,'' she said at a news conference.
	   The Russian-born Engquist had been seen as a strong contender
for the European Track and Field Championships in Budapest this
month. But she said the decision to drop out was the right one.
	   ''The last two nights, I've been able to sleep well for the
first time in two months,'' she said, according to the Swedish news
agency TT.

Lebanese killed in Israeli attack on southern Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli troops opened fire on Shiite Muslim
villages in southern Lebanon Wednesday, killing a Lebanese man,
security officials said.
	   They said the victim was driving on the road between the
villages of Zibqine and Jebal al-Boutom, facing an Israeli-occupied
zone in the south, when his car was hit by an Israeli shell and
caught fire.
	   The targeted area is around 15 kilometers (9 miles) southeast of
Tyre.
	   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, and
state-run Beirut radio said the dead man was possibly an official
of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group.
	   But Hezbollah said it had no information of the man's identity.
	   Hezbollah is the main group fighting to oust Israeli troops and
their Lebanese militia allies from a swath of land in South Lebanon
which Israel has occupied since 1985.
	   The attack came amid a report Wednesday in Beirut's Daily Star
newspaper that Israel is testing a new secret guided missile in
occupied South Lebanon before placing it on the international arms
market. It said the mini-cruise missile is being manufactured by
the state-owned Rafael armaments company.
	   But Rafael spokesman Noah Shachar denied Israel is manufacturing
or developing the missile, which the Star identified as ``almost
certainly'' the NT Dandy, also known as ``Long Spike.''
	   Shachar said the only missile Rafael manufactured is the 2.5
kilometer (1.5 mile) ``fire and forget'' GIL missile.
	   The English-language newspaper said a civilian has been killed
and four others wounded during the past three months by the
Israeli-made missile.
	   Among those wounded were three fighters, the paper said.
	   ``The Israelis are using Lebanese as human guinea pigs,'' said a
Daily Star editorial.
	   There was no immediate comment or confirmation from Lebanese
officials on the report. The Israeli army also did not immediately
comment.
	   Unlike the GIL, or ``short spike'' anti-tank missile which is
shoulder-fired, the long-range Dandy missile is designed to be
launched from helicopters, the Star said.
	   It said the missile, guided by an optic fiber during the initial
stages of flight, is much the same size as the standard U.S.-made
TOW anti-tank missile.
	   Israel has used the TOW missile on several occasions this year
in south Lebanon. Two brothers were killed in May in a TOW missile
attack on a village in the south.

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   A tropical wave has moved into the east and northeast Caribbean

Havel stable, pneumonia and irregular heartbeat persist
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fresh quotes, latest information.
 &UR; By ONDREJ HEJMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech President Vaclav Havel was
in stable condition Wednesday, but doctors were watching his
lingering pneumonia and irregularities of the president's heart
function.
	   ``There were no new dramatic developments overnight or during
the day,'' said Ilja Kotik, Havel's personal physician.
	   Kotik said Havel was awake, reading newspapers and communicating
through written notes.
	   The Czech leader suffered a ruptured colon in April while
vacationing in the Austrian Alps. He underwent emergency surgery
and a colostomy was performed.
	   On July 26, a combined Austrian-Czech team of doctors closed the
colostomy in Prague. Havel developed pneumonia related to the
operation on Monday.
	   Havel's condition worsened the following day as his heart rate
soared to 200 beats per minute and doctors had to stabilize his
condition with electric shocks.
	   On Wednesday, members of his medical team admitted pneumonia and
irregular heartbeat persisted, but the situation was not dramatic
anymore.
	   Kotik said Havel's heart rate was between 110 and 120 beats per
minute, which is normal in cases of pneumonia and temperatures
around 38 degrees Celsius.
	   According to members of Havel's medical team, the president was
put on a new type of antibiotics Wednesday morning, but their
effect could not be evaluated for another two days.
	   Havel, a former chain smoker and veteran of communist jails, has
suffered from chronic bronchitis for years.
	   He has been hospitalized five times since December 1996 when a
third of his lung and a cancerous tumor were removed.
	   ``The main problem are the lungs now'', said Bohumil Stastny a
lung specialist on Havel's medical team.
	   Stastny explained that bronchial phlegm often hindered Havel's
breathing, causing lack of oxygen in the bloodstream.
	   Last week, Havel suffered two cases of atelectase, when oxygen
is unable to get into the patient's lungs because of bronchi
blocked by phlegm.
	   ``That's very tough on his heart and that's what we fear the
most,'' Stastny said. ``But if you ask my personal opinion I think
there will be a happy ending to this''.
	   The Czech presidency is a largely ceremonial position, so while
Havel is hospitalized there is no need for his powers to be
transferred to someone else.
	   Should he be unable to return to office, parliament would
nominate a new president.

Dispute with Kenyan dealers deprives Mogadishu chewers of khat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By OSMAN WEHELYE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ A week-long dispute between Somali
traders and Kenyan producers of khat has dried up the supply of the
mildly narcotic leaf in the Somali capital and adversely affected
business.
	   But the bright side is that the ubiquitous gun-toting militiamen
are less aggressive deprived of their daily chew.
	   Somali dealers have refused to import Kenyan khat, accusing the
producers of shipping the best quality leaf to Europe and the Gulf
States while sending the residue to Somalia, dealer Ahmed Ali said
Wednesday.
	   As a result of the boycott, hundreds of khat stalls have closed,
and shops where young men would sip tea and chew the bright green
leaves are forced to close much earlier than usual.
	   Because khat is widely used in Somali society, many people make
a living selling it.
	   The few businessmen who have managed to air freight small
quantities of khat into Mogadishu are selling a half a kilogram
(about 1 pound) at drls 12 __ up from dlrs 2.50 before the boycott
began.
	   Businessmen estimate Somali dealers spend dlrs 300,000 a day on
khat which arrives in bales each morning aboard more than a dozen
planes from Kenya.
	   Khat (Catha edulis) grows in the Mt. Kenya area of central Kenya
and is considered best when it is still fresh with mountain dew.
	   But while khat dealers were complaining, health authorities
applauded and called for a ban on the leaf, which when chewed,
produces a mild stupor.
	   Health authorities say chewing khat not only causes social
problems when men spend the little money they have on the leaf, but
it also causes medical problems, including impotence.
	   Mogadishu residents also noted that militiamen, who while under
the influence of khat fire their rifles to make pedestrians give
way to armed pick-up trucks, were less agressive.
	   Somalia has been without a central government since the ouster
of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991 and subsequent
disintegration in clan-based fiefdoms.
	   During most of Siad Barre's 22-year rule, khat was outlawed. But
the trade and the habit have boomed since his ouster.

World markets shudder as Wall Street tries to rebound
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with Dow rising further, closing values for European
markets, ADDS new quotes, no pickup &QL;

	   LONDON (AP) _ Wall Street's big drop rattled investor sentiment
around the world, sending share prices lower Wednesday from Asia to
Europe before the New York Stock Exchange reopened with possible
signs of stability.
	   Blue chips on Europe's biggest markets lost about 2 percent of
their value, although many shares managed to finish above the lows
they hit during a hectic trading day.
	   ``It is unpleasant and nasty _ a white-knuckle ride,'' said
Jeremy Batstone, an analyst at Natwest Stockbrokers in London.
	   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
closed with a loss of 103.6 points, or 1.8 percent, at 5,632.5.
Earlier, the so-called ``footsie'' had been down by almost 2.9
percent on Europe's biggest market.
	   Frankfurt's DAX index finished its afternoon elecronic trading
session with a loss of 1.8 percent, similar to the losses by the
CAC 40 in Paris.
	   Some analysts urged shareholders not to panic _ but all eyes
were on Wall Street, where stocks were up then down then up in the
early going.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average was about 50 points ahead late
in the morning, in a turbulent session that earlier had seen it
lose around 75 points.
	   Big losses on the NYSE, where the Dow fell nearly 300 points on
Tuesday, sent shudders through smaller markets around the globe.
	   ``Investors just have to sit tight and see this downturn
through,'' said Ian Millward, an expert with the financial advisers
Chase de Vere in London. ``Markets are going to go down from time
to time, and this is not a major crash.''
	   Prices slid on many Asian markets, but the biggest one, the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, was able to recover from its early losses and
finish with a drop of just 0.2 percent by the key Nikkei index.
	   The limited losses in Tokyo gave traders some encouragement.
	   The Asian financial crisis is a major concern in global markets,
and attempts to fix Japan's weakened economy, the largest in the
region, is crucial to restoring stability and investor confidence.
	   Elsewhere in Asia, the picture was gloomier.
	   Hong Kong's Hang Seng index added to steep losses from earlier
in the week, while blue chips in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, have
tumbled to a nine-year low.
	   Experts on Wall Street said New York prices were hit largely by
concerns that profits will slip at many big U.S. multinationals.
The Asian crisis is taking its toll on many companies and
exacerbating concerns about the future direction of stock prices.
	   Some analysts are wondering whether the recent tumble in the
market is just another mini-correction or the start of a more
serious downturn.
	   European markets found themselves in an uncomfortable but
familiar position _ pushed lower as they were caught in the
cross-fire between the Asian markets and New York.
	   ``Greed is giving way to fear,'' said James Dewhurst, an
equities salesman at the British brokerage Charterhouse Tilney.
``People realize that Asia is going to affect U.S. corporate
profits in the third quarter as well.''

Big rise in illegal immigrant arrests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The number of illegal immigrants arrested at the
port of Dover jumped nearly fivefold this year, immigration
officials said Wednesday.
	   The Immigration Service arrested 1,484 people trying to enter
Britain through the English Channel port in the first seven months
of 1998, up from 317 during the same period last year, according to
newly released figures.
	   Immigration officials said the increase coincides with a greater
number of people seeking asylum in Britain and the continuing
conflict in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, which has caused
thousands of ethnic Albanians to flee.
	   But a spokeswoman for the Immigration Service said it was
impossible to say whether the increase reflected a greater number
of illegal immigrants or tougher border policing.

	   ITZHAR, West Bank (AP) _ Two Jewish settlers were shot and
killed early Wednesday in an area of the West Bank that has been a
point of contention in talks involving promised Israeli troop
withdrawals.
	   The double killings outside the settlement of Itzhar prompted
right-wing calls for a suspension of talks with the Palestinians,
which already are at an impasse.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed the shooting with
his security Cabinet Wednesday amid calls that he freeze
negotiations until Palestinians hand over the attackers.
	   Killed in Monday's attack were Harel Binoun, 18, and Shlomo
Livman, 24, both sons of prominent rabbis and students at the
Joseph's Tomb seminary in the heart of Nablus _ a focal point of
past confrontations between Palestinians and Jewish settlers.
	   Following the shootings, Israel placed a curfew on five
surrounding Palestinian villages and closed roads leading to Nablus
as troops searched the area.
	   Moshe Yaalon, the army's West Bank commander, said the two
Israelis were patrolling the settlement about midnight when they
were shot by two waiting attackers. One of the Israelis was
carrying a weapon, reportedly an M-16 assault rifle, which was
taken by the assailants.
	   There were calls for revenge at a memorial service Wednesday in
Jerusalem attended by hundreds of mourners.
	   ``How many can they kill and we'll keep sitting quietly?''
shouted one woman, Yaffa Cohen. ``An eye for an eye. One day Jewish
terrorists will rise and kill Arabs.''
	   Netanyahu said he believed that the gunmen came from
``Palestinian-controlled areas,'' but added that that hadn't been
confirmed.
	   ``I think this was a very, very serious crime and it underscores
our concerns regarding security and it also reaffirms our
insistence that the Palestinian Authority stick to its obligations,
which means fighting terrorism.''
	   Nabil Amr, an adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
member of the elected legislative council, said the attack
underscored the need for ``serious ideas'' from Israel to move the
peace process forward.
	   ``If Israel continues to waste time then that means we are
leaving the field open for others to do everything they want to end
the whole process, just like what happened last night,'' he said on
Israel Radio's Arabic service.
	   Negotiations have been stalled for months over a U.S. proposal
for Israel to withdraw from an additional 13 percent of the West
Bank, a move that would leave many Jewish settlements as islands
inside Palestinian-controlled zones.
	   Netanyahu, under pressure from the strong Jewish settler lobby
and right-wing members of his Cabinet, has insisted on changes in
the American plan, including more stringent counter-terrorism
measures by Palestinians.
	   Arafat, speaking Wednesday to Palestinian legislators, called on
the United States to ``officially expose and declare who is
responsible for the delay'' in reaching an agreement.
	   ``The Israeli government bears total responsibility for the
total freeze in the peace process and the total chaos that will
engulf the entire region if the peace process is destroyed,'' he
said.
	   A senior Palestinian official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Arafat sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on Tuesday night saying that the Palestinians
had bent over backward to make peace and that it was time for the
United States to say ``Enough'' to the Israelis.
	   In his latest offer, Netanyahu proposed withdrawing from 10
percent of the territory and turning an additional 3 percent into a
nature reserve where Israel's army would retain overall security.
Arafat rejected that proposal Tuesday.
	   Jewish settler leaders said even a 10 percent withdrawal would
leave Itzhar cut off and surrounded by Palestinian-controlled
territory.
	   Michael Kleiner, a supporter of the settlers in the Israeli
parliament, called for convening the 120-member Knesset, which is
now in summer recess, and debating a proposal to stop talks with
the Palestinians until Arafat's government hands over the attackers
to Israel.

Chilly, wet spring cuts further into French wine-grape production
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment, background
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Heavy spring rain, hail and frost took their toll
on France's vineyards, resulting in another drop in annual wine
production, the country's wine trade association said Wednesday.
	   In its first prediction for the year's harvest, the Office
National Interprofessionel des Vins said it expects growers to
produce 53.1 million hectoliters (1.40 billion gallons).
	   The figure is down 3.6 percent from the 55.1 million hectoliters
(1.45 billion gallons) produced last year, the ONIV said in a
statement dated Monday.
	   It continues a downward progression. The expected harvest would
be 10.9 percent lower than 1996 and 18.8 percent lower than 1992.
But it wouldn't be the worst: severe frost cut 1991 production to
42.6 million hectoliters (1.12 billion gallons), ONIV officials
said Wednesday.
	   France produces about one-fifth of the world's wine -- which
last year totaled 275 million hectoliters (7.26 billion gallons).
	   The statement did not say how the lower production might affect
wine prices or make any comment on the quality of the wine, and its
author explained that it depends on what happens in the coming
weeks.
	   ``Everything revolves on the sun in August, which will
accelerate the maturation'' of the grapes, Sophie Boucard said in a
telephone interview.
	   On prices, ``it's not just the harvest that decides that,'' she
added.
	   Vines this year bloomed later than last year and growth of the
crop ``was slowed by considerable rains during April,'' the
statement said.
	   Frost the night of April 13 affected the areas of Nantes, Macon,
Ardeche, Bas-Vivarais and the northern Cotes du Rhone as well as
the Aude and Minerve, the ONIV said.
	   Hail especially affected the Yonne area of Bourgogne, with its
grands crus chablis.
	   But the delay in growth ``often helped to avoid the worst,'' it
said.
	   Among certain key regions, Aquitaine, which includes Bordeaux
wines, had ``particularly cold and humid weather during the entire
month of April.'' But damage was limited, the group said.
	   Now, growers there have to worry about the beginnings of a
drought, it said. Production in Aquitaine is expected to be 8.4
million hectoliters (221 million gallons), down about 0.7 percent.
	   In Bourgogne, east of Paris, near-summer temperatures since May
allowed ``rapid development'' of the crop. But expected production
was off considerably at 1.9 million hectoliters (50 million
gallons), down 11.5 percent.

Iraqi Parliament calls for end to cooperation with U.N. inspectors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMS; RECASTS and UPDATES with foreign minister's quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's Parliament on Wednesday urged the
government to stop cooperating with U.N. weapons inspectors,
reflecting the country's heightened frustrations with eight years
of economic sanctions.
	   But Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf told reporters it
is ``premature'' to assume that Iraq will suspend relations
immediately on the basis of the unanimous decision by the
250-member National Assembly.
	   The decision _ reached after a six-hour debate _ needs to be
approved by the Revolutionary Command Council, the highest
decision-making body, and lastly by President Saddam Hussein.
	   Still, the rubber-stamp Parliament is unlikely to have made such
an important decision without Saddam's prior approval.
	   The brewing confrontation was triggered by a new dispute between
Iraq and arms inspectors in the United Nations Special Commission,
leading to an abrupt end to disarmament talks on Monday between
chief weapons inspector Richard Butler and Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz.
	   The trouble was over Aziz's demand that UNSCOM immediately give
Iraq a clean bill of health on its weaponry. Butler refused and
Aziz refused to talk any more.
	   Until UNSCOM certifies that Iraq is free of weapons of mass
destruction the U.N. Security Council will not lift the sanctions.
	   Butler left Baghdad Tuesday for New York where he is scheduled
to brief the Security Council on Thursday on the deadlock.
	   During a stopover in London, Butler told BBC radio that he found
Aziz's reaction inexplicable since he had told him the inspectors
were ``very close'' to certifying Iraq had destroyed its missiles
and chemical weapons.
	   He added though that inspectors were ``not close'' to solving
the problem of biological weapons.
	   Iraqi government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Saddam will probably wait for Butler's briefing before
deciding on whether to stop cooperating with the inspectors.
	   Non-cooperation implies that Iraqi officials could block the
inspectors from visiting suspected weapons sites or withhold
information and documents.
	   The Iraqis have created such hurdles in the past and it appears
that Baghdad is ready to at least make serious threats this time to
draw attention to the sanctions, which have crippled the country's
economy by banning the free sale of oil.
	   The sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
which led to the Gulf War the following year.
	   A Parliament statement said that since UNSCOM does not appear
ready to favor Iraq, ``the National Assembly calls for stopping
cooperation'' with the inspectors.
	   It said lawmakers pledged full support for any measures Saddam
takes and urged him to ``firmly carry out'' any steps he feels
necessary to confront the inspectors.
	   On Tuesday, Saddam approved an undisclosed plan to shake off the
sanctions. The National Assembly also is discussing the plan but it
is not clear if non-cooperation with the U.N. was part of it.
	   Butler, however, has said the latest trouble should not be seen
as a crisis.
	   Also, the United States and Britain did not react as harshly as
in the past to the breakdown of the talks.
	   During the last crisis earlier this year _ triggered by Iraq's
refusal to allow inspectors into presidential palaces _ U.S. and
British forces rushed to the Gulf and were poised to attack Iraq.
U.N. chief Kofi Annan's personal mediation averted the crisis _ and
a war.
	   Reacting to Monday's breakdown in talks, U.S. State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin said Saddam had ``shot himself in the
foot'' by mishandling a chance to end economic sanctions. ``Iraq
has only harmed itself.''
	   In Iraq, the official line is that the U.N. inspectors are
American stooges.
	   Foreign Minister Sahhaf accused the inspectors of creating the
crisis by provoking Iraq. The inspectors ``are cops of the dirty
American type,'' he said.
	   Oil Minister Amer Mohammed Rashid said ``shallow minded'' Butler
resorts to ``trivialities'' in his method of verification and
described the inspectors' work as ``a way full of evil and lies.''
	   ``This is enough. Iraq cannot continue with this ploy,'' Rashid
told reporters during a break in the Parliament debate.

Court okays arrest warrant for Rajiv Gandhi's Italian friend
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ An Indian court Wednesday upheld an
arrest warrant for an Italian friend of former Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi in a 13-year-old corruption scandal, federal investigators
said.
	   Ottavio Quattrocchi, an Italian businessman now living in
Malaysia, had sought to annul the indictment against him in a lower
court and to withdraw the arrest warrant given to Interpol for his
alleged involvement in a dlrs 1.2 billion arms scandal.
	   Quattrocchi's lawyer argued the lower court did not have the
jurisdiction to issue the warrants but the High Court rejected the
plea, said S.M. Khan, spokesman of the Central Bureau of
Investigation.
	   The Bureau's attempts to execute the warrants have been
unsuccessful so far because India has no extradition treaty with
Malaysia.
	   The Bureau alleges Quattrocchi used his influence with India's
leaders to secure the 1985 sale of howitzers for the Swedish arms
maker Bofors AB.
	   Allegations of illegal payoffs to officials in then Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi's administration led to the defeat of his
Congress Party in the 1989 elections, although no wrongdoing has
been proven in court.
	   Gandhi was assassinated in 1991. His Italian-born widow, Sonia,
was chosen earlier this year to lead the Congress Party, and the
Bofors scandal remains an election issue.
	   Investigators have named five people whom they suspect received
payments _ Quattrocchi, his wife, former Bofors agent in India Win
Chadha and two of Chadha's relatives.

Zurich launches campaign to locate Holocaust policy holders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ A leading Swiss insurer announced a
U.S. advertising campaign on Wednesday to locate Holocaust
survivors and heirs who could be beneficiaries of its life
insurance policies.
	   Zurich Insurance Co. said its advertisement will appear starting
Thursday in 10 U.S. newspapers.
	   They include The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Los
Angeles Times and The Miami Herald.
	   ``We believe it is our corporate responsibility to reach out to
the Jewish community in this fashion in order to increase the
opportunity for anyone who believes they may be a beneficiary of a
Zurich policy to come forward,'' chairman Rolf Hueppi said in a
statement.
	   Zurich is one of four European insurance companies that in April
reached an agreement with California Insurance Commissioner Chuck
Quackenbush and New York State Insurance Commissioner Neil D. Levin
to form an international commission to ensure insurance claims are
paid.
	   Also in April, it set up its own commission to review disputed
life insurance claims arising from the Holocaust era.
	   Zurich, then operating as Vita Life, had ``a small insurance
portfolio in various European countries'' before and during World
War II, the advertisement said.
	   The firm said that inquiries, either directly to the insurer or
via state insurance commissioners' offices, ``will be handled with
expediency, understanding and compassion.''

Rwandan president visits Zambia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ Rwandan president Pasteur Bizimungu on
Wednesday opened the door for his nation's future involvement in a
military rebellion in neighboring Congo.
	   Talking to reporters during an official state visit, Bizimungu
said however there is no current reason for Rwanda to be embroiled
in the conflict.
	   ``We do not know what the outcome will be like in Congo ... If
there should be any serious reasons to be involved, maybe we
should,'' Bizimungu said.
	   On Wednesday, Congo President Laurent Kabila accused Rwanda of
sending troops to help a Tutsi-led rebellion in eastern Congo,
where rebels reportedly captured two key cities. Rwanda has denied
involvement.
	   The Rwandan president called the developments in Congo
``regrettable.''
	   ``There should be stability in Congo because our stability as
neighboring countries depend on the stability in Congo,'' Bizimungu
said.
	   He said he had discussed Congo affairs with Zambian President
Frederick Chiluba at the beginning of his three-day visit.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prices plunged early Wednesday on the London Stock
Exchange, as traders reacted nervously to Wall Street's big losses
from Tuesday's session.
	   The blue-chip Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
closed with a loss of 103.6 points, or 1.8 percent, at 5,632.5.
Earlier, the so-called ``footsie'' had been down by almost 2.9
percent.
	   The pattern in London, the biggest European market, was repeated
elsewhere in the region as traders staged sell-offs in response to
Tuesday's drop of nearly 300 points by the Dow Jones industrial
average in New York.
	   Wall Street offered some encouragement Wednesday, when shares
erased early losses and moved into positive territory.
	   Preliminary volume in London came to 742 million shares,
compared with 856 million on Tuesday.

Manchester United, Arsenal confirm Super League talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Ajax also confirming talks, quotes from Alex
Ferguson, Franz Beckenbauer, FA, FIFA &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ After weeks of secret talks and self-imposed
silence, Manchester United, Arsenal and Dutch club Ajax confirmed
Wednesday they are involved in talks on forming a breakaway
European Super League.
	   But Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson insisted the
controversial proposal was purely ``hypothetical'' and that it
could take 10 years for the league to get off the ground.
	   While maintaining they remain committed to the English Premier
League, United and Arsenal said they were discussing the creation
of a new league which would change the face of European soccer.
	   There was no immediate comment from Liverpool, the third English
club reportedly approached about joining the proposed 32-team
competition.
	   In Amsterdam, Dutch giant Ajax also confirmed it was involved in
Super League talks.
	   British newspapers said the Super League idea is spearheaded by
former Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate and
owner of Serie A club AC Milan, and has the dlrs 2 billion backing
of Wall Street bank J.P. Morgan.
	   According to the reports, the league could kick off in the year
2000 and involve mid-week matches between Europe's elite clubs such
as Inter and AC Milan, Juventus, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern
Munich and Ajax.
	   The Super League would effectively replace UEFA's Champions
League.
	   Clubs involved in the new league would make more money from
television and advertising than they get from the UEFA
competitions. They also would be guaranteed permanent membership in
the league, without having to qualify each year as they do for the
UEFA tournaments.
	   FIFA and UEFA, soccer's world and European governing bodies,
have warned that clubs and players involved in a breakaway could be
banned from international competition.
	   And the English Premier League has threatened to kick out any
clubs which join without prior consultation.
	   Legal experts, however, say it could be impossible to stop the
league from going ahead as organizers would be protected by
restraint-of-trade laws.
	   ``Talk of the Super League is all hypothetical, it's all talk,
it could be 10 years away,'' Ferguson said. ``People have been
talking about such things for 50 years or so but that doesn't mean
they will happen.
	   ``It's only an idea. Ideas like this come and go. You have the
Champions' League at the moment that is extensive and it's only
going to get bigger next year.
	   ``I don't think you will see a Super League at the moment.
Discussions take place on everything in life, it doesn't mean to
say they are going to happen.
	   ``Maybe it is being suggested by people who feel they are not
getting enough of the TV money. It's a shot across the bows of the
people who run European football.''
	   In Germany, Bayern Munich president Franz Beckenbauer and
Borussia Dortmund manager Michael Meier suggested the proposed
Super League should be formed through UEFA.
	   ``UEFA has a plan for a super league in its drawer. Open it
up,'' Beckenbauer said in this week's Sport Bild magazine.
	   Meier told ARD television, ``According to our information, UEFA
has a clear plan for a European League.''
	   ``UEFA in the past has done nothing but market the champions
league with a Swiss agency,'' Meier said. ``If a private investor
comes here and says, `I have a similar format on a bigger scale,'
that is certainly not forbidden in a Europe that's growing
together.''
	   The statements released by United and Arsenal were almost
identical.
	   ``Manchester United/Arsenal confirms that it is involved in
discussions concerning the formation of proposed new European
competitions,'' one of the statements said. ``We would, however,
stress that we are totally committed to the FA Premier League and
other domestic competitions and are very mindful of our
responsibilities to the governing bodies.
	   ``There is no question of Arsenal committing to a new
competition until all appropriate consultations have taken place.
Football is a developing industry and we have a duty to examine any
serious proposal that we feel might be beneficial to Arsenal
Football Club, its fans, shareholders and football generally.''
	   The statements were welcomed by Football Association spokesman
Steve Double.
	   ``It's good news that this important issue is now out in the
open,'' he said. ``We particularly welcome the clubs' commitment
both to the Premier League and to the domestic competitions. We
feel sure that the fans will also welcome these statements.''
	   Ajax issued a statement nearly identical to those released by
the English clubs.
	   UEFA declined comment on Wednesday's statements.
	   FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said any competition has to be
organized by the recognized soccer authorities, in this case UEFA.
	   However, if competitions are organized ``left, right and
center'' by whomever wanted to organize them, ``it would be total
anarchy,'' Cooper said.

Acid test for series honors at Headingley
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: adds quotes from Allan Donald 9th graf and Alec Stewart
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LEEDS, England (AP) _ The battleground and the combatants are
predetermined but the result is not a foregone conclusion.
	   For the England and South Africa cricket teams, a much-needed
series victory is at stake as they battle for the honors in the
fifth and final cricket test at Headingley starting Thursday.
	   England, on a high after its series levelling eight-wicket win
at Trent Bridge in the fourth test, is eyeing its first five-test
series win since 1986-87.
	   For South Africa, a series win in England would be its most
prized accomplishment since returning to international cricket.
	   South Africa is yet to win a major series since being readmitted
to the test fold in 1992.
	   The Proteas were the dominant team in this series _ winning the
second test at Lord's by 10 wickets and narrowly missing another
win at Old Trafford when England's last pair of batsmen thwarted
them _ but they surrendered a 1-0 lead after losing the fourth
test.
	   ``Every Test is massive even if you are 3-0 up,'' South Africa's
captain Hansie Cronje said Wednesday. ``It's all to play for in
this one. And we don't mind that situation at all.''
	   South African fast bowler Allan Donald, who was fined by the
International Cricket Council Wednesday for criticizing an umpire
during the fourth test, is treating the test as the most important
match of his career.
	   ``I've not experienced a more important build-up since we
returned to international cricket,'' he said.
	   ``We desperately want to win the series but England will feel
they are on the verge of something huge, their biggest series win
for more than a decade.''
	   Donald said his bowling stint against England opener Mike
Atherton on the fourth afternoon of the fourth test was the most
intense 60 minutes he had experienced in a test match.
	   ``Hansie Cronje asked me to give him five overs of all my worth.
We exchanged words and looks, it was as hard as it gets, but he
survived somehow,'' he said.
	   South Africa, is considering its options for the crucial match _
whether to play five seamers. It might end up being a toss up
between two veterans, off-spinner Pat Symcox or all-rounder Brian
McMillan.
	   Another possible change could be McMillan for Gehardus
Liebenberg to open the batting with Gary Kirsten, which would
enable the Proteas to play Symcox at the expense of medium paceman
Steve Elworthy.
	   Headingley, traditionally is a seamer-friendly surface, hasn't
been a happy hunting ground for England. It has only won two tests
at the ground in the last 10 years, while losing six times in the
same period.
	   The last decade has not been a good win for English cricket in
terms of winning.
	   England has failed to win a series over a major test nation
since Mike Gatting's team won the Ashes 2-1 in Australia in
1986-87.
	   Since that Ashes victory, England has played both Australia and
the West Indies in four series and Pakistan and South Africa twice
each.
	   England has not won a five-test series on home soil since
beating Allan Border's Australia 3-1 in 1985.
	   If Alec Stewart's side can pull off a win at Headingley, it will
be the first time an England side has come from behind to win a
series since David Gower's side won 2-1 in India in 1984-85.
	   Stewart conceded that victory in the fourth test had renewed the
enthusiasm of English cricket fans but was cautious to put the
series into perspective.
	   ``We've won one on the trot,'' he said.
	   ``We start very much even. Everyone is aware just how important
the game is but as players we are just going to approach it as
another game.
	   ``If we get excited we may not do ourselves justice _ we are
aware it has been a long time since a major series win, but as
players we are staying composed and will go out there and play.''
	   England has retained an unchanged 12 and it is most likely that
left-arm seamer Alan Mullally will form part of a four-pronged pace
attack.
	   The last time England fielded an all pace attack, it was
trounced by an innings and 148 runs by Australia in 1993.
	   So, if the home side decides to go ahead with leg spinner Ian
Salisbury, the bowler to miss out could be Dominic Cork, who has
played in the first four tests.
	   England (from): Michael Atherton, Mark Butcher, Nasser Hussain,
Alec Stewart (captain), Mark Ramprakash, Graeme Hick, Andrew
Flintoff, Dominic Cork, Ian Salisbury, Darren Gough, Angus Fraser,
Alan Mullally.
	   South Africa (from): Gary Kirsten, Gehardus Liebenberg, Jacques
Kallis, Daryll Cullinan, Hansie Cronje (captain), Jonty Rhodes,
Mark Boucher, Shaun Pollock, Allan Donald, Paul Adams, Pat Symcox
and Makhaya Ntini.

Iraqi Parliament calls for end to cooperation with U.N. inspectors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Butler's quote on arrival in New York &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's Parliament on Wednesday urged the
government to stop cooperating with U.N. weapons inspectors,
reflecting the country's heightened frustrations with eight years
of economic sanctions.
	   But Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf told reporters it
is ``premature'' to assume that Iraq will suspend relations
immediately on the basis of the unanimous decision by the
250-member National Assembly.
	   The decision _ reached after a six-hour debate _ needs to be
approved by the Revolutionary Command Council, the highest
decision-making body, and lastly by President Saddam Hussein.
	   Still, the rubber-stamp Parliament is unlikely to have made such
an important decision without Saddam's prior approval.
	   The brewing confrontation was triggered by a new dispute between
Iraq and arms inspectors in the United Nations Special Commission,
leading to an abrupt end to disarmament talks on Monday between
chief weapons inspector Richard Butler and Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz.
	   The trouble was over Aziz's demand that UNSCOM immediately give
Iraq a clean bill of health on its weaponry. Butler refused and
Aziz refused to talk any more.
	   Until UNSCOM certifies that Iraq is free of weapons of mass
destruction the U.N. Security Council will not lift the sanctions.
	   Butler left Baghdad Tuesday for New York where he is scheduled
to brief the Security Council on Thursday on the deadlock.
	   Arriving in New York Wednesday, Butler said if Iraq decides to
break ``cooepration with us and make a run for it on their own,
that is very serious. And the Security Council will have to deal
with that.''

Iraqi opposition denies capture of Saddam's son's gunmen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ An Iraqi opposition group which claimed credit for
the attempted assassination of Saddam Hussein's oldest son in 1996
denied Wednesday that Iraqi security agents captured two of the men
involved.
	   The Islamic Daawa Party, the biggest and most influential
Islamic Shiite opposition group in Iraq, said in a statement that
all of the intended assassins ``are safe and free.''
	   ``They are living with their families in safe places and are
still carrying out their responsibilities in resisting the
oppression of the regime and freeing the Iraqi people,'' the party
said in a statement issued in London.
	   The Daawa Party was one of two groups that claimed credit for
shooting and seriously wounding Odai Hussein on Dec. 12, 1996. The
other was the Mohammed Madhlum al-Dulaimi Group, named after an
Iraqi air force general executed for plotting against Saddam.
	   Iraq's General Directorate of Security said in a statement
carried by Iraq television Monday that security forces captured the
two men who carried out the actual attack. The three others still
at large provided cover and support, the directorate said.
	   It accused a ``neighboring foreign country'' of masterminding
the attack but stopped short of naming the country. Odai, in an
interview from his hospital bed after the attack, pointed the
finger at Iran, which has denied any involvement.
	   Odai, who is now 34, was shot about 10 times while he waited
alone in his car in an upscale Baghdad neighborhood. In April 1997,
surgeons operated on his shattered left leg. He has since been
shown on television walking with the aid of a cane.
	   The Daawa Party said Iraqi claims two gunmen had been captured
were an attempt by Saddam to justify a recent campaign which has
seen the arrests of more than 760 people during the last month
alone.
	   ``These arrests took place in the south of the country where the
regime is facing an escalation in the heroic resistance to the rule
of Saddam Hussein,'' the party said.
	   The Daawa Party operates mainly out of Damascus and London but
is believed to have a large following in Iraq, especially in the
south where the Shiites are in a majority. It does not have good
relations with Iran.
	   The party used to carry out bomb attacks on government targets
in the early 1980s and is still active in the southern marshes and
on highways where it sometimes attack troops.

IRA, pro-British convicts to get parole applications
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Some imprisoned members of the
Irish Republican Army and two major pro-British paramilitary groups
could be freed by the end of the month, as part of the Northern
Ireland peace agreement, officials announced Wednesday.
	   The 400 prisoners eligible for parole by mid-2000 will get their
applications for early release Thursday, said the joint chairmen of
the Northern Ireland Sentence Review Commission, British civil
servant Sir John Blelloch and South African lawyer Brian Currin.
	   ``Many prisoners are expecting to walk out tomorrow and we need
to deal with that expectation,'' said Currin. He added that many
applications might be approved this month.
	   The IRA-allied Sinn Fein party and representatives of the Ulster
Defense Association and Ulster Volunteer Force welcomed the
announcement as essential to underpinning their cease-fires.
	   Blelloch said the 10-member commission would consider the
feelings of victims of the outlawed IRA, UDA and UVF when weighing
how speedily prisoners _ more than 100 of them serving life
sentences for murder _ should be released.
	   Victims would be entitled to know where and when a particular
prisoner would be freed, Blelloch said.
	   ``I don't think the victims can influence the timing of release.
But we are conscious, however, that there are ways in which we can
behave that are sensisitive and understanding, and we shall try to
do that,'' he said.
	   The promise of paroles for members of truce-observing groups was
the most controversial part of the agreement struck in April among
the British and Irish governments and eight Northern Ireland
parties.
	   Excluded from the program are convicts of four Northern Ireland
splinter groups _ three anti-British, one pro-British _ that oppose
the peace process.
	   Also Wednesday, a London judge allowed a 21-year-old Dublin
woman accused of taking part in a foiled conspiracy to plant bombs
in London last month to be freed on 190,000-pound (dlrs 305,000)
bail pending trial.
	   The case of Elaine Moore has been championed by some of the
Irish Republic's senior politicians, who say she is innocent.

Thousands of Bulgarians in Western Europe forced into prostitution
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VESELIN ZHELEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Thousands of Bulgarian women looking for
a better life in Western Europe instead fall prey to criminal gangs
and are forced into sex slavery, an international anti-prostitution
group said on Wednesday.
	   The group, called La Strada, said about 10,000 Bulgarians have
been forced into prostitution abroad. The organization recently
opened an office in the Bulgarian capital.
	   According to Nadia Kozhuharova, an activist with La Strada,
shady Bulgarian employment agencies usually attract young women by
offering them jobs as house servants or baby sitters in Western
Europe.
	   Most of the women are first taken to East European countries
where they don't require an entry visa, such as the Czech Republic,
Poland and Hungary, said Kozhuharova. From there, the women are
smuggled to Germany, Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands.
	   La Strada said the women are then sold by traffickers to pimps
for 2,000 and 5,000 German marks (dlrs 1,100 to 2,700). The average
prostitute earns the equivalent of dlrs 42,000 a year, of which she
sees nothing.
	   Once they arrive in the West, the pimps usually confiscate the
women's passports, preventing them from getting away.
	   ``Then the girls are raped, beaten and starved until they accept
becoming prostitutes in order to save their lives,'' said Maria
Chomarova, an activist at La Strada.
	   So far, 20 Bulgarian women who were able to flee their bosses in
Western Europe have returned to Bulgaria and told La Strada horror
stories about their experiences.
	   ``One of the girls said she had been tied to the back of a car
and dragged,'' Chomarova said. ``Others had numbers branded on
their skin.''
	   La Strada is funded by the Netherlands and has branches across
Eastern Europe. In addition to helping women return home safely,
the group also helps psychologically rehabilitate survivors and
reintegrate them into society.
	   But despite recent attempts by Western governments to address
the problem, few traffickers are prosecuted because the women are
reluctant to speak about their ordeals.
	   Bulgaria is grappling with the economic chaos caused by its
transition from communism to capitalism. The average salary is the
equivalent of dlrs 100 per month and about 400,000 Bulgarians have
emigrated, mainly to Western Europe, since the Iron Curtain fell in
1989.

Mentally ill Holocaust survivors denied use of reparations money
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to restore first reference to Shmuel Tsur, edits

 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Israeli caretakers have refused to allow German
reparations paid to mentally ill Holocaust survivors to be used to
improve the victims' conditions in hospitals, doctors said
Wednesday.
	   The patients, many of whom are in their 80s, suffer from acute
depression and other mental illnesses as a result of their
experiences in the Nazi death camps. A number have accumulated
large sums of money from compensation paid by the German
government.
	   However, because of their sickness, the survivors are wards of
the state, and their bank accounts are administered by the
court-appointed Fund for the Care of Dependents, which is
supervised by the government's General Custodian for Wards,
attorney Shmuel Tsur.
	   The Maariv newspaper, which reported the story Wednesday, said
in the early years after Israel's creation, from 1948-1952, the
government refused to accept mentally ill Holocaust survivors from
Germany. In 1952, a ship arrived from Germany with about 1,200 of
them, the paper said, and between 800 and 900 are still alive.
	   No figure was available for the total value of Holocaust
victims' property held by the Israeli government, but Jonathan
Lemberger, head of a survivors support organization, told The
Associated Press said it runs into billions of dollars.
	   The Abarbanel Hospital near Tel Aviv recently submitted requests
to the trustees for money to install air-conditioners, buy
television sets for the patients and to serve festive meals on
Independence Day or other festivals.
	   They were refused on the grounds that other patients in the room
would also benefit, not just the patient whose money was being
used, said Avner Elitsur, director of the psychiatric ward.
	   ``Unfortunately, there are still eight patients in a room,'' he
told The AP. ``We pointed out that the other patients are also
Holocaust survivors, but it didn't help.''
	   Asa Kasher, professor of philosophy and ethics at Tel Aviv
University, said the conduct of the officials towards the patients
was ``insensitive and immoral.''
	   ``How long do these unfortunate people have to live?'' he said.
``Can't we at least do something to make their last years a little
happier?''
	   Tsur and the director of the fund, Avi Angel, blamed each other
for the failure to improve patient living conditions. Each said he
would gladly have authorized the expenditure.
	   ``I am all in favor of alleviating the suffering of the
patients,'' Tsur told The AP. ``But I don't administer the
patients' accounts personally. I am the government's supervisor,
but the money is administered by the fund, and its directors don't
consult me.''
	   However, Angel said whenever the expenditure is not exclusively
for the ward's personal use, he cannot authorize it without the
express permission of Tsur, which he said was usually refused.
	   ``We initiated the plan to install TV sets, videos and air
conditioners for the survivors. We wanted to hold celebrations on
the festivals, to bring a bit of light into their lives. But the
custodian refuses to authorize it.''
	   The custodian's denial, which was also made in an interview with
Israel radio, was rejected by a volunteer group which cares for
Holocaust survivors.
	   ``He is sitting on billions of dollars which belonged to
Holocaust survivors, many of whom died without heirs, but he and
other officials involved refuse to spend it to help those still
alive, although the law says that is what it should be used for,''
said Jonathan Lemberger, head of the AMCHA group.
	   AMCHA provides psychological counseling and other support to the
survivors, many of whom have feelings of guilt because they lived
while their loved ones perished, Lemberger said.
	   When the group wanted to open a club for the survivors in the
northern city of Carmiel, officials refused to release the
necessary funds from the legacies, he said.
	   Lemberger said the custodian's inaction was symptomatic of the
Israeli government's attitude to the survivors.
	   ``When they die their money will pass to the state,'' he said.
``Israel complains about the Holocaust victims' money Switzerland
is holding. What about the money the Israeli government is
holding?''

Former spy served with injunction in New Zealand

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from lawyer for Tomlinson and Shayler &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A former British spy who served a four-month
prison sentence for trying to sell his story has been served with
an injunction in New Zealand in an attempt to prevent him from
making new ``damaging disclosures,'' the Foreign Office said
Wednesday.
	   New Zealand courts granted a temporary injunction against
Richard Tomlinson, 35, an aeronautical engineering graduate from
Cambridge University who worked for Britain's foreign intelligence
agency MI6. The Foreign Office said the injunction was served as
Tomlinson arrived in Auckland early Wednesday.
	   The Foreign Office sought the injunction against Tomlinson, who
has dual British and New Zealand citizenship, after David Shayler,
a former agent for the MI5 internal security service, was arrested
in Paris on Saturday.
	   Shayler, who disclosed details of the domestic intelligence
agency to a British tabloid The Daily Mail, was planning to divulge
further details of MI5 operations on an Internet website, according
to The Sunday Times.
	   The paper said Shayler was working with Tomlinson.
	   A Foreign Office spokesman said Tomlison could ``cause
substantial harm to the operations of the Secret Intelligence
Service and in some cases put life and livelihoods at risk.''
	   ``There is no question of taking this action to stifle criticism
of the Secret Intelligence Service. The reason for the action is to
protect the secrecy of the service's operations and maintain its
effectiveness,'' the spokesman said, speaking with customary
anonymity.
	   Tomlinson was given a 12-month jail sentence for an offense
against the Official Secrets Act in December. He admitted trying to
sell his story to an Australian publisher after a four-year career
with MI6 that took him to Moscow and Bosnia.
	   He was released from Belmarsh Prison in south London on parole
in April. He is prevented by a High Court injunction from
publishing any book in Britain.
	   ``In my view, this is further harassment,'' said Tomlinson's
British lawyer, John Wadham. ``Richard was off to New Zealand to
start a new life.''
	   The Foreign Office said it will seek a permanent injunction in a
New Zealand court to prevent Tomlison ``from making further
damaging disclosures in breach of his contractual obligations.''
	   ``The New Zealand government have demonstrated their support.
The attorney general in New Zealand has filed an affidavit which
supports the bringing of this action in the New Zealand courts,''
the Foreign Office spokesman said.
	   Britain has said it will seek Shayler's extradition from France.
	   Wadham, who also represents Shayler, said he will fight
extradition ``because his only fault was to disclose malpractice
and abuse within MI5.''
	   Shayler is being held in La Sante prison in Paris. Wadham said
he hopes to get a bail hearing by next week ``and I hope then he
will be released. It will not be easy to get bail and fighting
extradition may take a little longer.''

Korean Air plane skids off runway in Seoul
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A Korean Air passenger plane skidded
off a rain-slicked runway after landing Wednesday night at Seoul's
Kimpo International Airport, injuring at least 18 people.
	   The flight, carrying 397 passengers from Tokyo's Narita airport,
bounced and skidded before coming to rest in a meadow, SBS-TV
reported.
	   Fire engines raced to the scene as smoke rose from the plane,
but no flames could be seen, news reports said.
	   Korean Air officials said most of the 18 injured suffered minor
bruises and abrasions and none were in serious condition.
	   Four of those injured were Japanese and the rest were South
Korean. They were not identified.
	   There were 16 crew members aboard the Boeing 747-400 plane.
	   The plane left Tokyo at 5:30 p.m. (0830 GMT) and aborted landing
at Kimpo two hours later because of sudden rain showers. The jet
refueled in the southern resort island of Cheju before flying back
to Kimpo, where it landed about 10 p.m. (1300 GMT) airport
officials said.
	   Occasional heavy rains have buffeted Seoul and surrounding
provinces since Tuesday, flooding roads and submerging homes.
	   Korean Air adopted its present name in 1984. Until then, the
airliner had been called Korean Airlines, or KAL.

Lonely Ukrainian elephant to get German mate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukraine's most famous _ and lonely _
elephant is about to get a bride, officials said Wednesday.
	   Dirndl, a 30-year-old female, is on her way from Munich's
Hellabrunn Zoo to meet Boy, a 28-year-old, 7-ton male who has spent
around 10 years alone in the Kiev Zoo.
	   Dirndl was scheduled to cross Ukraine's western border on
Wednesday night and arrive in Kiev on Thursday, the Munich zoo said
in a statement. Officials at the Kiev Zoo confirmed the expected
arrival but had no further details.
	   Boy's last mate, Bama, died four years after giving birth to
their offspring, Key, who moved to Tbilisi Zoo in Georgia at the
age of 18 months.
	   Since then, the elephant, said to be the largest in European
zoos, has had to spend his time alone.
	   The 1991 Soviet collapse has left the Kiev Zoo, like many others
across the former Soviet Union, strapped for cash, which hampered
its search for a mate for Boy.
	   Meanwhile, the solitude has taken a heavy psychological and
physical toll on the elephant, a generally sensitive species,
according to zoo officials and animal lovers.
	   ``It is immoral to keep an animal lonely for such a long period
of time,'' Kiev Zoo director Oleksiy Lepeshkov recently told the
Kiev Post newspaper.
	   The arrival of Dirndl was finally secured, but it took a year to
clear bureaucratic obstacles blocking the trip, the Hellabrunn Zoo
said in a statement.
	   Dirndl was injected with a long-acting sedative two days before
being loaded into a container carried by a special vehicle, the
Munich Zoo said.
	   The journey so far has been successful, the zoo said. It added
that Hellabrunn's head keeper Robert Mueller was flying to Kiev to
greet Dirndl and help his Kiev colleagues care for her.
	   The female elephant is to spend one month in quarantine before
meeting Boy, Ukrainian reports said. Officials in Kiev have
renovated Boy's quarters to bring it up to Western standards and
make Dirndl comfortable.
	   Actually, the planned mating is not the first international
effort involving Boy. Back in 1996, a team of British veterinarians
flew to Kiev to help their Ukrainian counterparts fill a cavity in
Boy's tusk, which was broken in an accident.
	   The Munich and Kiev zoos hope to share the offspring of Boy and
Dirndl, who is still in her prime mating age.
	   ``I'm sure they will have babies,'' Lepeshkov said.
	   But there still are hurdles ahead, from the natural to the
bureaucratic. Dirndl might be rejected, in which case Hellabrunn
reportedly is to provide another animal.
	   And, under Ukrainian law, imported animals are required to leave
the country after one year, Lepeshkov told Kiev Post. He voiced
hope, however, that Dirndl's visa would be extended.

<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Newcastle defender and former England
international Stuart Pearce was treated at a hospital for minor
injuries Wednesday after his car collided with a truck on a country
road.
	   Pearce, a former England captain who was left off England's
squad for the World Cup in France, was alone in his car when a
truck overturned and smashed into his vehicle near the village of
Cotgrave.
	   Pearce was admitted to Queen's Medical Center in Nottingham and
treated for back pains and a minor hand injury. He was later
released.

Lara returns to form with a century
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Embattled West Indies cricket captain Brian Lara
scored his first century in 14 months on Wednesday, ending a string
of disappointing innings which had his supporters at Warwickshire
starting to turn against him.
	   Lara scored an unbeaten 139 to boost Warwickshire to 242 for
three against Middlesex in the County Championsip match at Lord's.
	   He had gone 39 innings without scoring a century while his
average dropped to 40. His captaincy at Warwickshire and his status
as the world's best batsman were under threat.
	   Last week Warwickshire fans booed him off the field after
another batting failure as his team crumbled to be all out for 98
and lost its Natwest Trophy quarterfinal to Leicestershire.
	   But it appears Lara, who scored a world record 501 in a county
match when he played for Warwickshire against Durham in 1994, is
back on track.

Russian premier to discuss gas development with Gazprom chief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko planned to
meet Thursday with the head of the natural gas monopoly Gazprom to
discuss future development of the natural gas industry, a news
agency reported.
	   During the meeting, Gazprom Chairman Rem Vyakhirev also hopes to
discuss the implementation of unspecified measures to boost
Gazprom's share price, Interfax said.
	   However, the report didn't say whether the meeting will cover
issues concerning the gas company's back debts.
	   On Monday, the government said it was close signing an agreement
with Gazprom on paying off its tax debts, totaling 12 billion
rubles (dlrs 2 billion). The agreement is also expected to specify
terms under which the government will offset 13 billion rubles
(dlrs 2.2 billion) various state agencies owe Gazprom for unpaid
gas supplies.
	   On Wednesday, the government said it would sell a 5 percent
stake in Gazprom to a single strategic bidder, without setting the
minimum asking price yet.
	   Kiriyenko might also meet with the heads of major Russia oil
companies Thursday, Interfax reported.

Kucera advances, Gustafsson upset
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Top-seeded Slovakian Karol Kucera
Wednesday claimed a quarterfinal berth in the Grolsch Open ATP clay
court tennis tournament, ousting Dane Thomas Larsen, 7-5, 6-3.
	   But Romanian qualifier Adrian Voinea came back from a set down
in his second round match to upset the No. 3 seed, Swede Magnus
Gustafsson, 4-6, 6-1, 6-3.
	   Voinea started weakly but gradually grew into the match and
began to force Gustafsson into the corners of the court with subtle
and varied shot-making.
	   Morrocan Hicham Arazi, who was disqualified Tuesday for
unsportsmanlike conduct in his match against Swede Magnus Norman,
is to lose his prize money of dlrs 4,770.
	   He is also likely to be fined for the incident, in which he
deliberately slammed balls out of court, but ATP officials declined
to comment on the fine before informing the player himself.
	   The three other remaining seeds in this dlrs 500,000 tourney at
the Bosbaan tennis complex on the edge of Amsterdam all strolled
through to the quarterfinals with straight sets victories.
	   Defending champion Slava Dosedel, seeded eight this year, put an
end to the hopes of initially nervous Dutch teenage prodigy Martin
Verkerk, 6-4, 6-4.
	   Australian No. 6 seed Richard Fromberg eliminated another
Dutchman Dennis van Scheppingen 6-3, 6-4 and the No. 7 seed,
Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia, ousted Spaniard Albert Portas 6-1, 6-2.
	   And in unseeded play, Argentinian Mariano Zabaleta, fresh from
his Tuesday first round upset of Spanish second seed Felix
Mantilla, downed Costa Rican Juan Antonio Marin 6-1, 7-6 (7-5).

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Military planes flew food and supplies
Wednesday to hundreds of people left homeless by two powerful
earthquakes that shook Ecuador's Pacific coast, toppling buildings
and killing two people. A third person died in the ensuing panic.
	   Fearing further tremors, hundreds of residents of towns in
Manabi spent Tuesday night on soccer fields or in parks, many
sleeping under makeshift tarpaulins. A rumor that a tsunami was
coming caused dozens of residents to spent the night in nearby
hills.
	   President Fabian Alarcon declared the coastal province of Manabi
where the quakes hit on ``yellow alert,'' ordering rescue workers
to prepare shelters in schools and hospitals in case of further
tremors.
	   Military planes rushed to deliver supplies to survivors.
	   The twin quakes struck Tuesday afternoon near the resort of
Bahia de Caraquez, 130 miles (220 kms) southwest of Quito, causing
200 houses and buildings to collapse, civil defense officials and
police reported.
	   One woman died of a heart attack during the panic, and a young
girl and a woman were killed by falling walls when their houses
collapsed in different towns across Manabi, a police report said,
raising the death toll to three.
	   Local hospitals reported treating 20 injured people.
	   The quakes cracked several high-rise apartment buildings that
ring the tropical beach front, but none collapsed.
	   Workers began clearing rubble and bricks Wednesday from the
resort's streets, a port city of 20,000 inhabitants that is the
favored vacation spot for the nation's wealthy.
	   The impoverished region was still recovering from massive
flooding earlier this year, which wiped out much of its
infrastructure.
	   ``I lost my house to El Nino, so I moved to a new neighborhood.
Now I have lost another house to an earthquake,'' said sobbing
homemaker Lidia Cespedes, standing amid the ruins of her small
house in Bahia de Caraquez.
	   Television channels showed President Alarcon on Tuesday holding
a table and looking nervous as a quake shook the governor's palace
in Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city, where he was attending a
state function.
	   The quake was also felt in Quito 130 miles (220 kms) away where
office towers swayed and workers ran out to the streets.
	   The first quake struck with a magnitude of 5.7, according to
Ecuador's Geophysical Institute. The second struck more than an
hour later with a magnitude of 7.1, according to the U.S.
Geological Survey in Golden, Colorado. At least 30 smaller tremors
followed the two quakes.
	   The earthquake was the largest in the area since a 7.8 magnitude
earthquake on Jan. 19, 1958, the institute said.

Iraqi Parliament calls for end to cooperation with U.N. inspectors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with inspections carried out normally today; Butler to
meet Annan in 14th graf. Edits to conform; RECASTS 11-12 grafs to
remove BBC attribution for Butler quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's Parliament on Wednesday urged the
government to stop cooperating with U.N. weapons inspectors,
reflecting the country's heightened frustrations with eight years
of economic sanctions.
	   But Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf told reporters it
is ``premature'' to assume that Iraq will suspend relations
immediately on the basis of the unanimous decision by the
250-member National Assembly.
	   The decision _ reached after a six-hour debate _ needs to be
approved by the Revolutionary Command Council, the highest
decision-making body, and lastly by President Saddam Hussein.
	   Still, the rubber-stamp Parliament is unlikely to have made such
an important move without Saddam's prior approval.
	   The brewing confrontation was triggered by a new dispute between
Iraq and arms inspectors in the United Nations Special Commission,
leading to an abrupt end to disarmament talks on Monday between
chief weapons inspector Richard Butler and Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz.
	   The trouble was over Aziz's demand that UNSCOM immediately give
Iraq a clean bill of health on its weaponry. Butler refused and
Aziz refused to talk any more.
	   Until UNSCOM certifies that Iraq is free of weapons of mass
destruction the U.N. Security Council will not lift the sanctions.
	   Butler left Baghdad Tuesday for New York where he is scheduled
to brief the Security Council on Thursday on the deadlock.
	   Arriving in New York Wednesday, Butler said if Iraq decides to
break ``cooperation with us and make a run for it on their own,
that is very serious. And the Security Council will have to deal
with that.''
	   Butler said the Iraq's refusal to talk any more is ``sad''
because he had told Aziz the inspectors were almost ready to
certify that Iraq has destroyed its missiles and chemical weapons.
	   He added though that inspectors needed more time to investigate
biological weapons.
	   ``We were getting there. If this were a five-lap race, we were
halfway into the fifth lap. Why stop now when you are getting
toward the finish line?'' he said.
	   Iraqi government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Saddam will probably wait for Butler's Security Council
briefing before deciding on whether to stop cooperating with the
inspectors. Butler also is scheduled to meet with U.N. chief Kofi
Annan later Wednesday.
	   Non-cooperation means Iraqi officials could block the inspectors
from visiting suspected weapons sites or withhold information and
documents.
	   But little evidence of that was visible Wednesday when the U.N.
experts carried out ``their inspections in a normal way,'' UNSCOM
spokeswoman Janet Sullivan said.
	   The Iraqis have created hurdles for the inspectors in the past
but for now it appears that Baghdad is at least willing to make
serious threats to draw attention to the sanctions, which have
crippled the country's economy by banning the free sale of oil.
	   The sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
which led to the Gulf War the following year.
	   A Parliament statement said that since UNSCOM does not appear
ready to favor Iraq, ``the National Assembly calls for stopping
cooperation'' with the inspectors.
	   It said lawmakers pledged full support for any measures Saddam
takes and urged him to ``firmly carry out'' any steps he feels
necessary to confront the inspectors.
	   On Tuesday, Saddam approved an undisclosed plan to shake off the
sanctions. The National Assembly also is discussing the plan but it
is not clear if non-cooperation with the U.N. was part of it.
	   The United States and Britain did not react as harshly as in the
past to the breakdown of the talks.
	   During the last crisis earlier this year _ triggered by Iraq's
refusal to allow inspectors into presidential palaces _ U.S. and
British forces rushed to the Gulf and were poised to attack Iraq.
Annan's personal mediation averted the crisis _ and a war.
	   In Iraq, the official line is that the U.N. inspectors are
American stooges.
	   Foreign Minister Sahhaf accused the inspectors of creating the
crisis by provoking Iraq. The inspectors ``are cops of the dirty
American type,'' he said.
	   ``This is enough. Iraq cannot continue with this ploy,'' Oil
Minister Amer Mohammed Rashid told reporters during a break in the
Parliament debate.

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with details of fighting in Uvira, situation

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ As rebels reportedly captured two major
towns and advanced on a third in troubled eastern Congo, President
Laurent Kabila's government on Wednesday accused one-time ally
Rwanda of sending soldiers across the border to deepen the revolt.
	   ``Almost 400 army forces have come from Rwanda and have caused
Congolese bloodshed,'' Congolese government spokesman Didier
Mumengi said Wednesday.
	   A leader of the mutineers, however, went on air on a rebel-held
radio station in the eastern town of Goma near Rwanda's border and
denied the uprising was anything but home-grown.
	   ``This is a struggle of the Congolese people,'' said Arthur
Z'Ahidi Ngoma, who was named rebel leader by a group of former
government supporters, opposition officials and soldiers in the
eastern town of Goma on Tuesday night, according to the rebel-held
station.
	   Ngoma refuted Kabila's accusations that the revolt was
ethnically-driven or spurred on by invading soldiers allegedly
deployed by Rwanda's ethnic Tutsi-led government.
	   Hostilities subsided Wednesday in the two largest towns in
Congo's eastern Kivu region _ Goma and Bukavu _ where rebels had
taken control, according to the rebel station and Rwanda's state
radio.
	   Fierce fighting, however, was reported in Uvira, further south
of Bukavu, in the South Kivu province, where rebels were believed
to be advancing.
	   On the other side of Congo on the Atlantic coastline, an
exchange of gunfire was seen Tuesday in the western village of
Kitona, although it was not clear who controlled the town or its
military base.
	   An unknown number of people were killed in the fighting,
government officials said on condition of anonymity.
	   That battle began after rebel gunmen forced an airplane they had
hijacked to land in Kitona, about 225 kilometers (140 miles)
southwest of the capital of Kinshasa. The hijackers were believed
to be ethnic Tutsis _ known as Banyamulenge _ fighters in the
eastern city of Goma.
	   In Kinshasa, a truck convoy loaded with troops was seen rumbling
out of the city headed to the east.
	   Although Kinshasa was stunned by brief gun battles in two army
barracks on Monday, the mood in the city was relatively calm as Red
Cross workers collected bodies left in the street from fighting the
day before.
	   Several Kinshasa businesses owned by ethnic Tutsis were
reportedly robbed and burned by gangs of local residents as a
dusk-to-dawn curfew was repealed.
	   Two Tutsi groups _ Banyamulenge and former Rwandan troops who
stayed in the country after Mobutu was overthrown _ were believed
to be leading the revolt against Kabila, accusing him of corruption
and nepotism.
	   The rebellion began about a week after Kabila ordered all
Rwandan troops out of the country. He did not explain the move.
	   A Rwandan official, who asked not to be further identified, said
Bizima Karaha, an ethnic Tutsi and Congo's foreign minister had
arrived in Goma, apparently to take up sides with the rebels.
	   Karaha, who was fired by Congo's president on Wednesday, did not
return to Kinshasa from South Africa as scheduled earlier this
week, giving rise to speculation that he may have sought political
asylum in South Africa.
	   Rwanda, Burundi and Zambia have closed their borders with Congo
while France and the United States have warned their citizens not
to travel there.
	   Rwanda has increasingly complained that Kabila has done little
to increase security in the Great Lakes region of central Africa.
	   The ethnic Tutsi population in eastern Congo has close links
with Rwanda, and Kabila's support and control of the region has
been faltering for months.

Holbrooke: Kosovo conflict has entered ''dangerous new phase''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The conflict in Serbia's rebel Kosovo province has
entered an ``extraordinarily dangerous new phase,'' U.S. Special
Envoy Richard Holbrooke said Wednesday.
	   He accused Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic of reneging on
a promise made to European Union representatives to stop military
operations against the majority ethnic Albanian population in
Kosovo.
	   ``That was clearly not true, and we are in the middle of a
massive military offensive,'' Holbrooke said in a BBC World Service
television interview.
	   In March, the Yugoslav president sent forces to crush the Kosovo
Liberation Army which is fighting for independence. Holbrooke said
Serbian forces are now ``rolling up the Kosovo Liberation Army
forces rather rapidly, creating enormous numbers of refugees.''
	   At least 10 percent of the province's population had become
refugees since fighting erupted earlier this year between ethnic
Albanian separatists and Serb security forces, Holbrooke said.
	   ``We've got a horrific situation,'' he said.
	   Holbrooke said that the U.S. negotiator in the region, Chris
Hill, had witnessed ``Serb looting in the streets, and (ethnic
Albanian) refugees huddled in the trees and forests above the
towns.''
	   Kosovo, located in Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia,
has a population of 2 million. Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
	   Holbrooke said he wasn't part of the decision making process
which could order NATO airstrikes against Serbia or Serbian forces
in Kosovo, but warned, ``all I can tell you is that the situation
has entered an extraordinarily dangerous new phase.''

Mentally ill Holocaust survivors denied use of reparations money
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli government caretakers have refused to
let German reparations paid for mentally ill Holocaust survivors be
used to improve their lives in hospitals, doctors said Wednesday.
	   The patients, many of them in their 80s, suffer from acute
depression and other mental illnesses, some as a result of their
experiences in the Nazi death camps.
	   Many survivors have received large sums of money from the German
government, the daily Maariv newspaper reported.
	   However, because of their sickness, the mentally ill survivors
are wards of the state, and their bank accounts are administered by
the government. The state also holds compensation money of some
other survivors.
	   No official figure was available for the value of all Holocaust
victims' property held by the Israeli government, but Jonathan
Lemberger, head of a survivors support organization, told The
Associated Press that it runs into the billions of dollars.
	   He said if the money is not used on the survivors it will revert
back to the Israeli government when they die.
	   Lemberger said that when his group wanted to open a club for the
survivors in the northern city of Carmiel, officials refused to
release the necessary funds.
	   The government trustees also turned down a request by the
Abarbanel Hospital near Tel Aviv for money to install
air-conditioners, buy television sets for the patients and pay for
special meals on Independence Day and other festivals.
	   The hospital was refused on the grounds that other patients in
the room would also benefit, not just the patient whose money was
being used, said Avner Elitsur, director of the psychiatric ward.
	   ``Unfortunately, there are still eight patients in a room,'' he
said. ``We pointed out that the other patients are also Holocaust
survivors, but it didn't help.''
	   Lemberger said the custodian's inaction was symptomatic of the
Israeli government's attitude to the survivors.
	   ``When they die their money will pass to the state,'' he said.
``Israel complains about the Holocaust victims' money Switzerland
is holding. What about the money the Israeli government is
holding?''

Archaeologists begin removing ancient graves despite protests

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Archaeologists began removing ancient graves to
make way for a major new road Wednesday, despite months of protests
by hundreds of ultra-Orthodox Jews angry at the diggers for
disturbing the dead.
	   Archaeologists will move the bones of the 28 graves to a
different site so the roadwork can be completed, said Osnat Goaz, a
spokeswoman with the Israeli antiquities authority.
	   Some of the protesters, dressed in traditional black garb, laid
on the ground near the graves to try to block their removal,
forcing police to physically remove them from the site.
	   ``These graves are Jewish and they shouldn't be touched by the
archeologists,'' said Yehuda Meshi-Zahav, a leader in the
ultra-Orthodox community whose protests delayed the road from being
completed for the past 18 months.
	   Meshi-Zahav disputed archaeologists claims that the ancient
graves likely contain the remains of Christians buried during the
Byzantine period. Meshi-Zahav said that evidence he had seen
suggested that the graves contained the remains of Jews.
	   ``Jews always bury the dead with their heads toward Jerusalem
and their arms down their sides,'' Meshi-Zahav said.
	   The bones found in the dig will be put into earthen jugs and
given to officials from Israel's ministry of religious affairs, who
will then re-bury them underneath the road, Goaz said.
	   Police clash frequently in Jerusalem with male members of the
ultra-Orthodox community, who protest at digs and other sites which
they believe disgrace Jewish law.

Albanians: Serbs buried victims at garbage dump
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The graves of dozens of ethnic
Albanians have been discovered in a garbage dump in a separatist
stronghold of Kosovo overrun by Serb forces last month, ethnic
Albanians said Wednesday.
	   The village of Orahovac, 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of
Pristina, was the scene of fierce battles in July between Serb
forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army fighting for independence for
the southern Serbian province.
	   At least 60 civilians were killed in five days of fighting,
according to the Pristina-based Committee for the Protection of
Human Rights.
	   But there were wide discrepancies in reports and claims about
victims having been buried in multiple or mass graves.
	   At a garbage dump about a kilometer (half-mile) outside
Orahovac, an Associated Press Television crew on Wednesday saw
about 50 small mounds of earth, marked with sticks, some of them
bearing ethnic Albanian names, others just numbers.
	   A small bulldozer, apparently used to level the terrain, was at
the site.
	   A European Union observer mission that visited Orahovac found no
evidence of mass graves, team leader Walter Ebenberger of Austria
told the Austrian Press Agency by telephone from Pristina.
	   The ethnic Albanian daily Koha Ditore in Pristina reported that
at least 36 fresh graves had been discovered near the town on
Tuesday.
	   Veton Surroi, a prominent ethnic Albanian politician who visited
the site Tuesday, claimed that as many as 200 Albanians were killed
in Orahovac, most of them in a mosque where they had taken refuge.
	   The Austrian daily Die Presse carried a report Wednesday that
fresh graves containing the bodies of more than 500 people,
including children, just outside of Orahovac.
	   Serbian Deputy Information Minister Radmila Visic called the
report a lie.
	   A Serb police source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
police had buried ``a number of bodies'' in the Orahovac area after
no one claimed them from a morgue after more than a week.
	   Fighting continued Wednesday between ethnic Albanian separatists
and Serb security forces in the central Kosovo region of Drenica,
according to ethnic Albanian sources. Near Likovac, many refugees
on about 400 tractors and trailers were evacuating toward the towns
of Vucitrn and Kosovska Mitrovica, the Kosovo Information Center
said.
	   In the area between Junik and Djakovica near the Albanian
border, seven villages allegedly have been leveled by Serbs while
``a repositioned KLA continues with resistance,'' the pro-Albanian
center said.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic sent forces to crush the
KLA in March. Kosovo, located in Serbia, the dominant republic of
Yugoslavia, has a population of 2 million. Albanians outnumber
Serbs 9-to-1.
	   Milosevic, who was accused by the United States this week of
violating a pledge to allow humanitarian agencies to reach ethnic
Albanians displaced by the conflict, now is assuring them they can
go home.
	   In Belgrade Wednesday, Milosevic met U. S. envoy Christopher
Hill, state-run Tanjug news agency reported. The talks focused on
Kosovo, Tanjug said, and the ``urgent need to facilitate return of
civilians to their homes.''
	   Milosevic reportedly also highlighted that government
authorities discern between ethnic Albanian civilians and
guerrillas and assistance will be given to displaced civilians so
their lives can return to normal.
	   The Serbian interior ministry used airplanes Wednesday to drop
leaflets urging all displaced in Kosovo to return to their homes.
	   ``We guarantee your safety,'' the leaflets in both Serbian and
Albanian said.

	   VALENCIA, Spain (AP) _ An abandoned three-story apartment
building collapsed Wednesday in the old quarter of Valencia,
trapping two workers that had been doing restoration work and
seriously injuring two others, rescue services said.
	   A total of 12 men were on the site when the building came
crashing down. Five managed to extricate themselves from the rubble
and three more were pulled out with only slight injuries.
	   Hours after the collapse firemen rescued two more workers. One
was hospitalized in serious condition with crushed legs and another
in critical condition with abdominal and back injuries, said Laura
Navarro, spokeswoman for the regional government's rescue services.
	   Rescue teams continued to comb through the rubble in search of
the last two laborers.
	   The cause of the collapse was not immediately known.
	   State radio quoted people who live in the neighborhood as saying
the building was about 100 years old.

Havel stable, pneumonia and irregular heartbeat persist
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fresh quotes, latest information. &QL; 
 &UR; By ONDREJ HEJMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech President Vaclav Havel was
in stable condition Wednesday, but doctors worried about lingering
pneumonia and an irregular heart rate.
	   ``There were no new dramatic developments overnight or during
the day,'' said Ilja Kotik, Havel's personal physician.
	   Kotik said Havel was awake, reading newspapers and communicating
through written notes.
	   Havel's heart rate soared to 200 beats per minute Tuesday and he
fell into critical condition for two hours because of blood
poisoning caused by pneumonia. Doctors stabilized his condition
with electric shocks.
	   The 61-year-old president suffered a ruptured colon in April
while vacationing in the Austrian Alps. He underwent emergency
surgery and a colostomy was performed.
	   On July 26, a combined Austrian-Czech team of doctors closed the
colostomy in Prague. On Monday, Havel developed pneumonia related
to the operation.
	   On Wednesday, Kotik said Havel's heart rate was between 110 and
120 beats per minute, which is normal in cases of pneumonia, and
had a temperature of around 38 degrees Celsius (100.40 degrees
Fahrenheit).
	   ``The main problem are the lungs now,'' said Bohumil Stastny, a
lung specialist on Havel's medical team.
	   ``But if you ask my personal opinion, I think there will be a
happy ending to this,'' he said
	   Havel, a former chain-smoker and veteran of communist jails, has
suffered from chronic bronchitis for years.
	   A playwright and former dissident, Havel has been hospitalized
five times since December 1996, when a third of his lung and a
cancerous tumor were removed.
	   The Czech presidency is a largely ceremonial position, so while
Havel is hospitalized there is no need for his powers to be
transferred to someone else.
	   Should he be unable to return to office, parliament would
nominate a new president.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Portugal and Indonesia have agreed to
discuss granting the troubled province of East Timor autonomy and
to further involve East Timor activists in the talks, foreign
ministers said Wednesday.
	   Both agreements, announced after two days of talks brokered by
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, were concessions. Portugal, the
province's colonial master until 1975, previously backed nothing
short of self-determination for East Timor. Indonesia had insisted
that it should remain the only conduit to the East Timorese.
	   Wednesday's agreement assigned that task to Annan, who said he
would seek input from East Timorese leaders within and without the
province.
	   He said that included Jose Ramos Horta, a leading East Timorese
independence activist and co-winner of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize
based in Lisbon _ and previously anathema to the Indonesians.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ As rebels reportedly captured two major
towns and advanced on a third in troubled eastern Congo, President
Laurent Kabila's government on Wednesday accused one-time ally
Rwanda of sending soldiers across the border to deepen the revolt.
	   ``Almost 400 army forces have come from Rwanda and have caused
Congolese bloodshed,'' Congolese government spokesman Didier
Mumengi said Wednesday.
	   A leader of the mutineers, however, went on air on a rebel-held
radio station in the eastern town of Goma near Rwanda's border and
denied the uprising was anything but home-grown.
	   ``This is a struggle of the Congolese people,'' said Arthur
Z'Ahidi Ngoma, who was named rebel leader by a group of former
government supporters, opposition officials and soldiers in the
eastern town of Goma on Tuesday night, according to the rebel-held
station.
	   Ngoma, a veteran opposition figure who was briefly jailed by
Kabila's regime, refuted the government's accusations that the
revolt was ethnically-driven or spurred by invaders deployed by
Rwanda's ethnic Tutsi-led government.
	   Rwanda's President Pasteur Bizimungu also denied the country had
reason to be involved in the conflict, but left open the
possibility for future intervention.
	   ``We do not know what the outcome will be like in Congo ... If
there should be any serious reasons to be involved, maybe we should
(become involved),'' Bizimungu said during an official visit to
Zambia.

Government insists on 1956 delimitation of southern Sudan

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with government position paper on possible referendum;
wrangle over reference to government &QL; 
 &UR; By ABEBE ANDUALEM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ In the event that a referendum on
self-determination is held in southern Sudan, the government in
Khartoum will insist that the territory be limited to the three
provinces recognized at the time of independence in 1956.
	   Reporters on Wednesday obtained copies of the position paper of
the government of President Omar al-Bashir on the second day of
another round of peace talks aimed at ending the 15-year civil war
with the Sudan People's Liberation Army.
	   In addition to Bahr al-Ghazal, Equatoria and Upper Nile
provinces, the SPLA also wants Southern Kordovan and Southern Blue
Nile provinces included in the territory that would vote in a
referendum.
	   Substantive discussions were held up for more than two hours, a
source said, by a verbal clash between Sudanese Foreign Minister
Mustafa Osman Ismail and SPLA representatives after the SPLA's
chief delegate, Salva Kiir Mayardit, referred to the government
delegation as ``a representative of the National Islamic Front,''
and not the government of Sudan.
	   The source said Kenyan Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana, who is
chairing the talks, appealed to both sides not to make an issue of
the SPLA statement for the sake of the talks.
	   The talks, held under the auspices of the regional
Inter-Governmental Authority on Development, are expected to end
Thursday.
	   On Tuesday, participants agreed to a three-point agenda that
included discussion of the limits of southern Sudan, the role of
the Muslim religion in the region's future and administrative
details connected with an internationally supervised referendum on
self-determination in the southern portion of Africa's largest
nation.
	   After the wrangle, both sides presented their positions in
working documents which the source, which could not be further
identified as Godana had declared a press blackout, said were
comprehensive and dealt with all three issues.
	   It was not immediately possible to obtain a copy of the SPLA's
position paper.
	   The 15-year civil war has ravaged Sudan and created a famine
that is claiming hundreds of lives a day.
	   In the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, a U.S. official who has just
returned from the famine-stricken area, said Wednesday that
although more food is being delivered to the area, the situation is
not improving.
	   ``Explanations? An immediate one offered is diversion. On that
there is little doubt that not all of the food gets to where we
feel it should,'' said Roy Williams, director of foreign disaster
assistance fo the U.S. Agency for International Development.
	   There have been claims that the SPLA is taking part of the
relief food to feed its troops.
	   The SPLA has been fighting government troops since 1983 for
greater autonomy for the largely African, Christian and animist
south from the Islamic, Arabized north.
	   More than 1.5 milion people have died due to the fighting and
resultant famines.
	   Last month, both sides declared a three-month cease-fire in
southwestern Bahr al-Ghazal province to facilitate delivery of
relief food. On Monday, Sudan expanded the area of its cease-fire,
but the SPLA called it a publicity maneuver prior to the opening of
the talks.

Police oust Rainbow Family gathering from Russian camp
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALICE LAGNADO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Armed police swooped down on a
peace camp in a Russian village, pushing around American and
Russian camp members and ordering them to leave, the campers said
Wednesday.
	   Approximately 100 Defense Ministry troops and ordinary police,
their dogs and a helicopter entered the camp at Mshinskaya, a
village 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of St. Petersburg on
Tuesday, according to Rainbow Family campers.
	   The Rainbow Family is a loose, leaderless affiliation of people
associated with the hippie movement in the United States. The
group, which claims more than 25,000 followers, has no particular
religious or political bent.
	   Witnesses said police ordered 400 people to pack up and leave
for St. Petersburg within two hours. They claimed that many of the
police were drunk, and pushed and kicked people as well as stealing
money and valuables.
	   Police denied the claims, and said they closed the camp because
it violated health standards and because the campers were using
illegal drugs.
	   ``There were no conflicts. This is nonsense. They just did not
want to leave the camp,'' said Alexander Rostovtsev, acting head of
the St. Petersburg police press service.
	   Rainbow Family members acknowledged that police told them they
had to close the camp down on health grounds. But they insisted
that the police had treated them brutally.
	   ``They said there was a hepatitis epidemic. They were pushing
us, they had dogs and sub-machine guns. It was awful,'' said
Natasha Silantyeva, 31, a translator from St. Petersburg.
	   ``People were pushed, people were screaming, babies were crying.
It was a horror story,'' said Bill, 42, an American, who declined
to give his last name.
	   Rostovtsev said police found large quantities of drugs and
knives. Asked to specify the drugs, he mentioned only
hallucinogenic mushrooms.
	   Joth Shakerley, 32, a British photographer, said that although
people had smoked ``mild grass'' at the camp and eaten fresh
mushrooms from the forest, they had not indulged in anything
stronger.
	   He said his tent was ripped and that police took dlrs 300 of his
money.
	   Marina Tikunova, 22, who is studying to become a lawyer, said
the police had planted drugs among campers. ``People saw this. We
had no drugs,'' she said, in remarks which were supported by
several others.
	   The group was made up of mostly Russians, along with Americans,
Australians and at least the one Briton.
	   The group also included 30 children who were not with their
parents. Police took them to a children's center in St. Petersburg
and said they would send them home, though Wednesday evening some
remained at the center.

	   HUELVA, Spain (AP) _ A lifeguard rescued a toddler clinging to
her father's dead body after he suffered a heart attack while
swimming in the Atlantic, the Civil Guard said.
	   The incident occurred Wednesday at a beach in the town of La
Antilla in the southern province of Huelva.
	   The three-year-old girl was rescued as she floated about 100
meters offshore. ``She was lying on top of her father's body,'' a
Civil Guard official said.
	   He said the man had turned 40 on Tuesday. His name was not
released but officials said he was from Seville.

Commission.
	   _ a new executive bureau should be formed to direct the
activities of the commission and its staff.
	   _ the new office bureau should include ``an equal number of
members representing permanent members of the Security Council. Its
chairmanship should be carried out in rotation.
	   _ Iraq should be present in the new bureau as an observers.
	   _ The new Special Commission should move its headquarters from
New York to U.N. premises either in Geneva or Vienna.
	   _ The Security Council must ``legally politically and
practically adhere'' to conditions that will respect Iraq's
sovereignty and legitimate rights,'' including the no-fly zones
that U.S. and its allies set up after the Gulf War in the north and

	   Annan described the deal as ``progress,'' but said he did not
regard it as a breakthrough.
	   ``It's not a global solution,'' Portuguese Foreign Minister
Jaime Gama said of the agreement, which calls for a solution by the
end of this year. But ``we have moved from principled positions to
common ground,'' he said.
	   A working paper prepared last week by Annan's special envoy to
the region, Jamsheed Marker, was optimistic, anticipating movement
on the issue because of democratic reforms promised by President
B.J. Habibie.
	   The autonomy, proposed by Indonesia, would allow East Timorese
full governance except in the areas of foreign affairs, external
defense, and some monetary policies, said Indonesia Foreign
Minister Ali Alatas.
	   It would not mean a full withdrawal of forces, he said.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Making the most of his latest court victories,
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr is calling key members of the
White House legal team before a grand jury. Administration
officials fear he may even summon the chief counsel to the
president.
	   Legal strategist Lanny Breuer testified Tuesday, and returned to
the courthouse Wednesday for a sealed proceeding in U.S. District
Judge Norma Holloway Johnson's courtroom to discuss his refusal to
answer certain questions in his initial testimony Tuesday, legal
sources said.
	   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
rulings that cleared the way for Breuer's testimony left open the
possibility that the White House could try to block certain
questioning by making additional claims of attorney-client
privilege or resurrecting its earlier claim of executive privilege,
which it dropped earlier this spring.
	   At the courthouse, ancitipation built that Ms. Lewinsky would
begin her grand jury testimony Thursday.
	   Meanwhile, former White House deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes
arrived Wednesday to give testimony to the grand jury. Five Secret
Service employees also testified.
	   A source familiar with the grand jury appearances, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Starr has now questioned about 20
current and former Secret Service employees, mostly uniformed
officers and small number of agents.
	   Johnson, the U.S. Court of Appeals and Chief Justice William
Rehnquist all have declined to block the White House lawyers'
testimony, including that of Clinton confidant Bruce Lindsey, a
deputy White House counsel.
	   But the administration might be trying to build a record for a
possible Supreme Court case later on, to uphold the attorney-client
principle. The appeals court ruled that while an attorney-client
privilege exists between government lawyers and their government
clients, there is a higher obligation to cooperate with a criminal
investigation.
	   The administration said it feels so strongly about preserving
attorney-client confidentiality that it will push to have the high
court hear the case months after the White House lawyers'
testimony. Lindsey, who is under subpoena, is recuperating from
back surgery.
	   White House spokesman Barry Toiv said White House concern was
not about ``one or more people testifying'' but rather ``the
ability of not just this president but more importantly future
presidents to have the benefit of the attorney-client privilege,
which is a bedrock of our legal system.''
	   In its legal papers trying to block the testimony, the White
House made clear it fears that more of its lawyers, possibly even
chief counsel Charles Ruff, will be summoned. ``We anticipate that
additional subpoenas will soon follow,'' the administration told
the Supreme Court.
	   Starr is trying to determine whether Clinton had an affair with
Ms. Lewinsky, lied about it under oath and attempted to cover it
up. Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky both denied in the Paula Jones lawsuit
against the president that they had a sexual relationship.
	   Legal sources say Ms. Lewinsky, now a cooperating witness for
Starr, has told prosecutors she and Clinton did have a sexual
relationship, discussed ways to conceal it and agreed that she
would return gifts to Clinton's secretary. Those sources also say
she has provided Starr with a dress she claims was stained during a
sexual encounter with Clinton.
	   The FBI lab is testing the dress to determine whether it
contains any genetic material that might be linked to Clinton.
	   Clinton is scheduled to testify by closed-circuit television on
Aug. 17.

Ethnic Albanians report fresh graves at Kosovo garbage dump
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 11 grafs to UPDATE with EU observer quoted as
saying he saw no evidence of mass graves, Serbian calling newspaper
report a lie. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The graves of dozens of ethnic
Albanians have been discovered in a garbage dump in a separatist
stronghold of Kosovo overrun by Serb forces last month, ethnic
Albanians said Wednesday.
	   The village of Orahovac, 30 miles (45 kilometers) southwest of
Pristina, was the scene of fierce battles in July between Serb
forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army fighting for independence for
the southern Serbian province.
	   At least 60 civilians were killed in five days of fighting,
according to the Pristina-based Committee for the Protection of
Human Rights.
	   But there were wide discrepancies in reports and claims about
victims having been buried in multiple or mass graves.
	   At a garbage dump about a half-mile (kilometer) outside
Orahovac, an Associated Press Television crew on Wednesday saw
about 50 small mounds of earth, marked with sticks, some of them
bearing ethnic Albanian names, others just numbers.
	   A small bulldozer, apparently used to level the terrain, was at
the site.
	   A European Union observer mission that visited Orahovac found no
evidence of mass graves, team leader Walter Ebenberger of Austria
told the Austrian Press Agency by telephone from Pristina.
	   The ethnic Albanian Koha Ditore daily in Pristina reported that
at least 36 fresh graves had been discovered near the town on
Tuesday.
	   Veton Surroi, a prominent ethnic Albanian politician who visited
the dump Tuesday, said as many as 200 Albanians were killed in
Orahovac, most of them in a mosque where they had taken refuge.
	   The Austrian daily Die Presse reported Wednesday that fresh
graves of more than 500 people, including children, had been
discovered in the Orahovac area by journalists.
	   Serbian Deputy Information Minister Radmila Visic called the
report a lie.
	   A Serb police source confirmed police had buried ``a number of
bodies'' in the Orahovac area after no one claimed them from a
morgue after more than a week. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Fighting continued Wednesday between ethnic Albanian separatists
and Serb security forces in the central Kosovo region of Drenica,
according to ethnic Albanian sources.
	   Milosevic sent forces to crush the KLA in March. Kosovo has a
population of 2 million, of which Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
	   Continued fighting has stymied plans to send international aid
convoys to help refugees. Serb police have been barring or slowing
aid groups and diplomatic observers from reaching tens of thousands
of refugees driven from Kosovo villages.
	   The International Red Cross has reached a valley in Drenica
where many refugees fled, but clashes have stalled their aid
efforts.
	   Qirez, about 15 miles (25 kilometers) northwest of Pristina, is
located in a valley in the western Drenica region that has been a
target of a Serb onslaught now in its ninth day.
	   When aid workers arrived there Tuesday, they found hundreds of
desperate people. Refugees crowded around a truck loaded with boxes
of infant medicine, food and other supplies. Many have been
subsisting on a diet of water and green peppers.
	   Drenica is the largest area still under KLA control. From the
hilltops, smoke was visible Tuesday from burning villages _
including the former stronghold of Lausa _ now overrun by Serb
police in a symbolic defeat for the KLA.

Settlers demand halt to talks, vow vengeance in double slaying

	   ITZHAR, West Bank (AP) _ Right-wing Jewish settlers and their
supporters on Wednesday demanded a formal suspension of peace talks
with the Palestinians, hours after two Israelis were ambushed and
killed at their isolated West Bank settlement.
	   Attackers repeatedly shot the two at close range and riddled
their white four-wheel-drive vehicle with bullets, the Israeli
military said. The shootings occurred around midnight as the pair
patrolled the boundaries of the settlement of Itzhar, on a remote,
rocky hilltop outside the Palestinian-controlled city of Nablus.
	   The slain men, aged 18 and 24, were both sons of prominent
right-wing rabbis, and both were students at a Jewish seminary in
Nablus that has been a focal point of past confrontations between
Palestinians and Jewish settlers.
	   Even before the slayings, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had
been under heavy pressure from the right wing and the powerful
settler lobby to not cede more West Bank land to the Palestinians.
With the killings, that pressure intensified.
	   Several right-wing lawmakers called for parliament to return
from its summer recess and consider steps to stop the already
foundering negotiations with the Palestinians.
	   ``We will build this land, we will keep this land, and we won't
give it over to murderers,'' said lawmaker Shaul Yaalom, whose
party has threatened to break with Netanyahu's ruling coalition
over the pullback issue.
	   Netanyahu said he viewed the attack ``very gravely'' and added
that it underscored the seriousness of Israel's security concerns.
	   Yasser Arafat, addressing Palestinian lawmakers Wednesday in the
West Bank town of Ramallah, did not mention the killings, instead
focusing on the deadlocked peace talks.
	   ``The Israeli government bears total responsibility for the
total freeze in the peace process, and the total chaos that will
engulf the entire region if the peace process is destroyed,'' he
said.
	   Israeli-Palestinian negotiations have been stalled for months
over a U.S. proposal for Israel to withdraw from an additional 13
percent of the West Bank. The two sides held two weeks of
high-level talks in an effort to restart the negotiations, but
reached no accord.
	   Settler leaders say Netanyahu's latest troop-pullback offer _
rejected Tuesday by Arafat as giving the Palestinians too little
land _ instead concedes too much territory, leaving settlements
like this one vulnerable to attack.
	   ``This is a tragic example of what is likely to occur tenfold
when troop redeployments are carried out,'' said settler leader
Ahron Dombe.
	   At an emotional memorial service in Jerusalem for the slain
settlers, some right-wing mourners interrupted a rabbi's prayer
with raucous catcalls. ``Why don't you talk about revenge?'' one
yelled.
	   ``An eye for an eye!'' said mourner Yaffa Cohen, red-faced from
anger and the stifling heat. Afterward, thousands joined in a
funeral procession back to Itzhar for the burials, breaking ground
for the settlement's first graves.
	   No arrests had been made by late Wednesday, and Israeli
officials said they believed the assailants had fled into adjacent
Palestinian-run areas.
	   There has long been bad blood between Itzhar, home to about 300
people, and its Palestinian neighbors.
	   ``I'm so angry and worried _ I can't even imagine what will
happen now,'' said Palestinian farmer Hashem Ahlan.
	   He and other villagers say settlers have stolen their livestock,
burned fields, uprooted olive trees and built roads in an effort to
grab land. Now the villagers fear reprisal attacks.
	   Ahlan's village of Ain Aboos, along with four other Palestinian
villages, was under military curfew Wednesday as Israeli soldiers
searched for suspects.
	   Up the hill at Itzhar, the mood was angry and volatile. A few
youths at the settlement's gate shouted threats and insults at
arriving journalists. Most residents were reluctant to talk about
the killings.
	   ``Look, it's not an unusual day in this country,'' one man said
bitterly.
	   Israel's Channel 2 television reported that the murder weapons
were Kalashnikov assault rifles, which are used by Palestinian
security forces and widely sold on the black market in the
Palestinian lands.
	   Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel said the killings gave
added weight to Israel's demands that Palestinians confiscate
illegal weapons, and that Israel retain control of roads used by
settlers.
	   Palestinian lawmaker Ziad Abu Zayyad noted, however, that the
shootings occurred on land still under full Israeli control.
	   ``As long as Israeli settlers are living inside the Palestinian
territories and among the Palestinian population, these things will
happen,'' he said.

	   The announcement means that U.N. experts can no longer search
suspected weapons sites in Iraq, which they have been doing since
1991.
	   Still, the exemption for the monitoring activities means that
cameras and sensors installed in suspected weapons sites can remain
in place.
	   A statement read on national television said that Saddam reached
the decision after meeting with Iraq's most powerful
decision-making body, the Revolutionary Command Council which he
chairs, and with members of the ruling Baath party.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Archaeologists began removing ancient graves to
make way for a major new road Wednesday, despite months of protests
by hundreds of ultra-Orthodox Jews angry at the diggers for
disturbing the dead.
	   Archaeologists will move the bones of the 28 graves to a
different site so the roadwork can be completed, said Osnat Goaz, a
spokeswoman with the Israeli antiquities authority.
	   Some of the protesters, dressed in traditional black garb, laid
on the ground near the graves to try to block their removal,
forcing police to physically remove them from the site.
	   ``These graves are Jewish and they shouldn't be touched by the
archeologists,'' said Yehuda Meshi-Zahav, a leader in the
ultra-Orthodox community whose protests delayed the road from being
completed for the past 18 months.
	   Meshi-Zahav disputed archaeologists claims that the ancient
graves likely contain the remains of Christians buried during the
Byzantine period. Meshi-Zahav said that evidence he had seen
suggested that the graves contained the remains of Jews.
	   ``Jews always bury the dead with their heads toward Jerusalem
and their arms down their sides,'' Meshi-Zahav said.
	   The bones found in the dig will be put into earthen jugs and
given to officials from Israel's ministry of religious affairs, who
will then re-bury them underneath the road, Goaz said.
	   Later in Jerusalem's downtown area, hundreds of ultra-Orthodox
men clashed with police at a demonstration against the grave
removals. Police spokesman Shmuel Ben Ruby said protesters threw
stones and garbage cans at police, who ``used force to disperse the
crowd.''
	   Police clash frequently in Jerusalem with male members of the
ultra-Orthodox community, who protest at digs and other sites which
they believe disgrace Jewish law.

Despite currency fall IMF gives upbeat report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ In the midst of the second currency
crisis in eight months, the head of a visiting International
Monetary Fund team gave his approval of the government's handling
of the country's economy, according to government media.
	   Michael Nowak, assistant director of the IMF's Africa
department, arrived Tuesday with a team to assess the government's
eligibility for continued disbursement of a dlrs 176 million loan.
	   The state-controlled Herald newspaper and news agency Ziana
quoted Nowak as saying that the government had kept well within its
target on the budget deficit and that inflation was expected to
drop sharply in the next few months.
	   Nowak was quoted as expressing concern over the slow pace of
privatization of state-owned assets, government price controls, its
stance on the possible confiscation of white-owned farms and an
inadequate reduction of the civil service, Dow Jones Newswires
reported.
	   President Robert Mugabe faces the most serious crisis yet since
leading the former Rhodesia from independence in 1980.
	   With price increases and inflation above 20 percent, trade
unions are threatening a five-day strike against economic
mismanagement and corruption.
	   The government also plans to seize 1,500 commercial farms owned
mostly by whites and redistribute them to landless blacks.
	   Earlier this year, eight people died in protest demonstrations
and the government used helicopters and troops to quell riots.
	   On Tuesday, the currency depreciated by about 20 percent. The
Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, the country's central bank, did not
intervene and has stopped publishing its weekly foreign reserves
figures, Dow Jones reported.

Ethnic Albanians report fresh graves at Kosovo garbage dump

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The graves of dozens of ethnic
Albanians have been discovered in a garbage dump in a separatist
stronghold of Kosovo overrun by Serb forces last month, ethnic
Albanians said Wednesday.
	   The village of Orahovac, 30 miles (45 kilometers) southwest of
Pristina, was the scene of fierce battles in July between Serb
forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army fighting for independence for
the southern Serbian province.
	   At least 60 civilians were killed in five days of fighting,
according to the Pristina-based Committee for the Protection of
Human Rights.
	   But there were wide discrepancies in reports and claims about
victims having been buried in multiple or mass graves.
	   At a garbage dump about a half-mile (kilometer) outside
Orahovac, an Associated Press Television crew on Wednesday saw
about 50 small mounds of earth, marked with sticks, some of them
bearing ethnic Albanian names, others just numbers.
	   A small bulldozer, apparently used to level the terrain, was at
the site.
	   A European Union observer mission that visited Orahovac found no
evidence of mass graves, team leader Walter Ebenberger of Austria
told the Austrian Press Agency by telephone from Pristina.
	   ``There are allegedly some thin graves with names on them, but
no mass graves,'' he told CNN.

 &UR; U.N. weapons chief says Iraq stalemate isn't a crisis &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Saddam Hussein freezing cooperation with U.N.
weapons inspectors. Changes dateline. RECASTS to conform. Trims. No
pickup &QL; 
 &UR; With Iraq

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler said
Wednesday that he did not view the collapse of disarmament talks
with Iraq as ``a crisis.''
	   His comments came hours before Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
froze cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors to protest eight
years of economic sanctions.
	   Saddam's move followed after Iraq's 250-member National Assembly
voted unanimously earlier Wednesday to cut off cooperation.
Legislators voted after a new dispute with the weapons inspectors
charged with determining whether Iraq has eliminated its weapons of
mass destruction.
	   Butler said Iraq's demand that he inform the U.N. Security
Council that Baghdad no longer has any weapons of mass destruction
was ``puzzling'' because of Iraq's progress toward disarmament in
several areas.
	   In comments made before Saddam's move, Butler said if Iraq
decides to break ``cooperation with us and make a run for it on
their own, that is very serious. And the Security Council will have
to deal with that.''
	   Butler, who arrived in New York on Wednesday via London, said he
would present his findings to the Security Council on Thursday, but
would meet with Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Wednesday ``and see
where we go.''
	   The international sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in
1990, sparking the Gulf War, cannot be lifted until the U.N.
inspectors certify Iraq has destroyed all its chemical and
biological weapons and long-range missiles. The sanctions ban Iraq
from freely exporting its most valuable commodity _ oil.
	   During his brief stopover in London, Butler played down talk of
a crisis.
	   When he spoke to Annan on Monday night from Baghdad after the
talks collapsed, ``I very specifically told him that I don't think
any of us should describe this as a crisis,'' Butler told BBC Radio
4.
	   Butler cut short his visit to Baghdad after talks with Iraq's
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, who demanded a clean bill of
health on Baghdad's weapons programs.
	   Recalling his meeting, Butler said Aziz told him: ``You must go
and tell the Council the truth _ that is that we no longer have any
weapons of mass destruction.''
	   ``I said `I can't do that because, you see I don't have a magic
wand. I can't do disarmament by declaration. I have to have
evidence for any such claim, and sadly there's insufficient
evidence to justify your claim that you don't have any more weapons
or capability to make them,''' Butler said. ``I appealed to him to
give us those last bits of evidence that we need. He declined to do
so.''
	   Butler said he found Aziz's stance puzzling because the
commission is close to saying Iraq has no weapons of mass
destruction in some areas.
	   ``In the missile area, we're very close. In the chemical weapons
area, we're very close. We're not close in the biological weapons
area. And that's what was most puzzling to me _ that he should
insist on this ... claim that everything is done, because he knows
very well that that's far from true in the biological area,''
Butler said.
	   In the area of biological weapons, he said, ``Iraq has never
told us anything like the truth about its basic program.''
	   Butler said he agrees with those who say that the best way to
deal with the Iraqis is to give them a glimmer of hope that
sanctions will be lifted.
	   ``When people feel they're boxed in, as obviously the Iraqis do,
it's intelligent to offer them a light at the end of the tunnel, a
way out,'' he said. ``On the other hand ... they have prolonged
this matter for seven years. They always had the key in their hands
to an exit from sanctions and that key was disarmament, to tell us
the truth, lead us to the weapons, let us dispose of them.''

	   ITZHAR, West Bank (AP) _ Two Jewish settlers were shot and
killed early Wednesday in an area of the West Bank that has been a
point of contention in talks involving promised Israeli troop
withdrawals.
	   The double killings outside the settlement of Itzhar prompted
right-wing calls for a suspension of talks with the Palestinians,
which already are at an impasse.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed the shooting with
his security Cabinet Wednesday amid calls that he freeze
negotiations until Palestinians hand over the attackers.
	   Killed in Monday's attack were Harel Binoun, 18, and Shlomo
Livman, 24, both sons of prominent rabbis and students at the
Joseph's Tomb seminary in the heart of Nablus _ a focal point of
past confrontations between Palestinians and Jewish settlers.
	   Following the shootings, Israel placed a curfew on five
surrounding Palestinian villages and closed roads leading to Nablus
as troops searched the area.
	   Moshe Yaalon, the army's West Bank commander, said the two
Israelis were patrolling the settlement about midnight when they
were shot by two waiting attackers. One of the Israelis was
carrying a weapon, reportedly an M-16 assault rifle, which was
taken by the assailants.
	   There were calls for revenge at a memorial service Wednesday in
Jerusalem attended by hundreds of mourners.
	   ``How many can they kill and we'll keep sitting quietly?''
shouted one woman, Yaffa Cohen. ``An eye for an eye. One day Jewish
terrorists will rise and kill Arabs.''
	   Netanyahu said he believed that the gunmen came from
``Palestinian-controlled areas,'' but added that that hadn't been
confirmed.
	   ``I think this was a very, very serious crime and it underscores
our concerns regarding security and it also reaffirms our
insistence that the Palestinian Authority stick to its obligations,
which means fighting terrorism.''
	   Nabil Amr, an adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
member of the elected legislative council, said the attack
underscored the need for ``serious ideas'' from Israel to move the
peace process forward.
	   ``If Israel continues to waste time then that means we are
leaving the field open for others to do everything they want to end
the whole process, just like what happened last night,'' he said on
Israel Radio's Arabic service.
	   Negotiations have been stalled for months over a U.S. proposal
for Israel to withdraw from an additional 13 percent of the West
Bank, a move that would leave many Jewish settlements as islands
inside Palestinian-controlled zones.
	   Netanyahu, under pressure from the strong Jewish settler lobby
and right-wing members of his Cabinet, has insisted on changes in
the American plan, including more stringent counter-terrorism
measures by Palestinians.
	   Arafat, speaking Wednesday to Palestinian legislators, called on
the United States to ``officially expose and declare who is
responsible for the delay'' in reaching an agreement.
	   ``The Israeli government bears total responsibility for the
total freeze in the peace process and the total chaos that will
engulf the entire region if the peace process is destroyed,'' he
said.
	   A senior Palestinian official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Arafat sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on Tuesday night saying that the Palestinians
had bent over backward to make peace and that it was time for the
United States to say ``Enough'' to the Israelis.
	   In his latest offer, Netanyahu proposed withdrawing from 10
percent of the territory and turning an additional 3 percent into a
nature reserve where Israel's army would retain overall security.
Arafat rejected that proposal Tuesday.
	   Jewish settler leaders said even a 10 percent withdrawal would
leave Itzhar cut off and surrounded by Palestinian-controlled
territory.
	   Michael Kleiner, a supporter of the settlers in the Israeli
parliament, called for convening the 120-member Knesset, which is
now in summer recess, and debating a proposal to stop talks with
the Palestinians until Arafat's government hands over the attackers
to Israel.

BAGHDAD: legitimate conditions.''

	   Saddam's stunning decision came only after the move was
unanimously recommended by his rubber-stamp parliament, the
250-member National Assembly, in a six-hour debate.
	   The confrontation follows Iraq's demand this week that U.N.
inspectors immediately certify that the country is free of weapons
of mass destruction.
	   Chief weapons inspector Richard Butler refused to give that
certification during his talks Monday with Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz, who immediately ended the talks.
	   Until the inspectors certify that Iraq is free of illegal
weapons, the U.N. Security Council will not lift the sanctions.
	   Butler left Baghdad on Tuesday for New York where he is
scheduled to brief the Security Council on Thursday on the
deadlock.
	   Arriving Wednesday in New York, Butler said Iraq's refusal to
hold further talks is ``sad'' because he had told Aziz the
inspectors were almost ready to certify that Iraq has destroyed its
missiles and chemical weapons.
	   He added though that inspectors needed more time to investigate
biological weapons.
	   ``We were getting there. If this were a five-lap race, we were
halfway into the fifth lap. Why stop now when you are getting
toward the finish line?'' he said.
	   He had earlier warned that if Iraq decides to break
``cooperation with us and make a run for it on their own, that is
very serious. And the Security Council will have to deal with
that.''
	   Butler is scheduled to meet with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan later Wednesday.
	   Non-cooperation means Iraqi officials could block the inspectors
from visiting suspected weapons sites or withhold information and
documents.
	   The Iraqis have created hurdles for the inspectors in the past
to draw attention to the sanctions, which have crippled the
country's economy by banning the free sale of oil.
	   The sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
which led to the Gulf War the following year.
	   Saddam set the stage for ending cooperation during the
Parliament debate earlier Wednesday when lawmakers pledged full
support for any measures he takes to confront the inspectors.
	   During the last crisis earlier this year _ triggered by Iraq's
refusal to allow inspectors into presidential palaces _ U.S. and
British forces rushed to the Gulf and were poised to attack Iraq.
Annan's personal mediation averted the crisis _ and a war.
	   Iraq's official line is that the U.N. inspectors are American
stooges.
	   Foreign Minister Sahhaf accused the inspectors of creating the
crisis by provoking Iraq. The inspectors ``are cops of the dirty
American type,'' he said.
	   ``This is enough. Iraq cannot continue with this ploy,'' Oil
Minister Amer Mohammed Rashid told reporters during a break in the
Parliament debate.

	   ``There may be a residue of forces there, but in much more
reduced form,'' Alatas said.
	   About 600 soldiers will leave East Timor on Saturday, completing
a withdrawal of 1,000 troops, the Indonesian military said
Wednesday.
	   Another apparent concession by Indonesia was Alatas' pledge that
jailed rebel chief Xanana Gusmao would be released in the context
of an ``overall solution.''
	   Habibie previously offered to release Gusmao in exchange for
international recognition of Indonesia's claim to the province,
which has not been forthcoming since its annexation in 1976.
	   Indonesia has promised to release other political prisoners in
the territory as the talks progress.
	   No mention was made of East Timorese demands for a referendum on
independence among the province's 800,000 people _ a proposal
previously backed by Portugal.
	   The two sides also agreed to allow Indonesia to open up an
interest section in a ``friendly embassy'' in Lisbon _ most likely,
Thailand's embassy.
	   Portugal's interests in Jakarta are represented by the embassy
of the Netherlands.
	   Habibie replaced former autocratic leader Suharto as president
in May, and pledged democratic reforms and greater flexibility on
East Timor, a half island territory about 2,000 kilometers (1,200
miles) east of Jakarta.

Anglican bishops condemn homosexual relations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANTERBURY, England (AP) _ Anglican bishops declared Wednesday
that homosexual relations are ``incompatible with Scripture,''
expressed opposition to the ordination of practicing homosexuals
and affirmed traditional teachings that sex is permissible only
within marriage.
	   After a two-and-a-half-hour debate, participants in the
once-a-decade conference took a stronger line than their leader,
Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey, who wanted the issue
referred for further study.
	   The resolution was adopted on a vote of 526 to 70, with 45
bishops abstaining. It was a defeat for liberal bishops, most
notably those in Europe and the United States.
	   ``Homosexual practice is nowhere recognized in Scripture ... It
is condemned in both Old and New Testaments as an immoral act, and
therefore a sin,'' said the Rt. Rev. Eustace Kamanyire, Bishop of
Ruwenzori in Uganda.
	   Bishops who ordain homosexuals or bless same sex unions are
``undermining the faith'', he said.
	   African bishops have backed an even stronger motion that
condemns homosexuality and says to do otherwise would be
``evangelistic suicide.'' But the Rt. Rev. Catherine Roskam of New
York said such strong statements would hamper the work of the
church in the United States.
	   The Rt. Rev. Duncan Buchanan, the Bishop of Johannesburg, South
Africa, said the draft statement offered to the conference was
designed to bridge strongly held differences.
	   ``It does not commend anything other than traditional attitudes
toward marriage and chastity,'' Buchanan said.
	   But a series of amendments adopted by the conference took a
stronger line, especially the clause ``rejecting homosexual
practice as incompatible with Scripture.''
	   The Rt. Rev. David Crawley, Bishop of Kootenay in Canada,
complained that the amendments ``bit by bit, step by step'' were
giving the resolution ``the face of condemnation.''
	   Liberal bishops won a concession with an amendment that
committed church leaders ``to listen to the experience of
homosexual people.''
	   The votes demonstrated growing influence of generally
conservative bishops in Third World countries and Asia, whose
churches were established by missionaries from the Church of
England.
	   Some bishops were annoyed the homosexual issue had come to the
top of the conference agenda, above their concerns on international
debt.
	   During the debate, the moderator of the Church of South India,
the Most Rev. Vasant Dandin, called for a time limit on the debate
and objected to the amount of time devoted to ``a trivial
business.''
	   The Rt. Rev. Michael Lugor of Sudan said that Christian martyrs
would laugh that the bishops were debating this issue.
	   ``In Sudan, we know nothing of homosexuality. We only know the
Gospel,'' Lugor said.
	   Carey expressed his satisfaction with the resolution and said he
firmly believed in the traditional teachings of sex only within
marriage. But he said he was concerned that differences could widen
into divisions and urged both sides to respect and listen carefully
to each other.
	   The Lambeth Conference _ which drew more than 700 bishops,
including 11 women, this year _ has no authority to regulate
doctrine among the national churches, but it is the main
consultative body for Anglicans.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Wednesday
froze cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors to protest eight
years of economic sanctions against his country.
	   Saddam's move came hours after Iraq's 250-member National
Assembly voted unanimously to cut off cooperation and called for an
end to sanctions. Legislators voted after a new dispute with the
weapons inspectors charged with determining whether Iraq has
eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Saddam decided after a meeting with senior officials to
``completely suspend cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission
and the International Atomic Energy Agency,'' a government
statement said.
	   The announcement means that U.N. experts can no longer search
suspected weapons site in Iraq, a mission that the U.N. commission
has been carrying out since 1991 in a bid to eliminate Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction.
	   Still, Saddam said he would exempt U.N. monitoring activities in
Iraq from his decision, meaning that cameras and sensors installed
in suspected weapons sites can remain in place.
	   The confrontation was triggered by the collapse of talks Monday
between chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler and Iraq's lead
negotiator, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.
	   Arriving in New York on Wednesday, Butler said if Iraq decides
to break ``cooperation with us and make a run for it on their own,
that is very serious. And the Security Council will have to deal
with that.''
	   Butler said he would present his findings to the Security
Council on Thursday, but would meet Wednesday with
Secretary-General Kofi Annan after reading the Iraqi parliament's
declaration.
	   The international sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in
1990, sparking the Gulf War, cannot be lifted until the U.N.
inspectors certify Iraq has destroyed all its chemical and
biological weapons and long-range missiles. The sanctions ban Iraq
from freely exporting its most valuable commodity _ oil.
	   Iraq's latest stand threatens to bring to a halt the U.N.
program to uncover Iraq's illegal weapons, a mission often
disrupted by confrontations between Iraqi and U.N. officials.
	   An Iraqi parliament statement issued after Wednesday's six-hour
session called for an ``end to cooperation'' with the U.N. Special
Commission, saying the inspectors would never give Iraq a clean
bill of health on its weaponry. It also demanded all sanctions be
lifted by the U.N. Security Council.
	   Saddam reached the decision after chairing a meeting of the
Revolutionary Command Council, Iraq's most powerful decision-making
body, and members of the ruling Baath party, the statement said.
	   It was read on national television.
	   On Tuesday, Saddam approved a series of undisclosed measures to
fight the sanctions. The parliament was also discussing those steps
and it was not clear if the resof weapons
inspections.
	   Criticism of Iraq by Britain and the United States appeared
muted compared to past confrontations when the two countries
threatened military action.
	   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin
said Tuesday that Saddam had ``shot himself in the foot'' by
mishandling a chance to end economic sanctions. ``Iraq has only
harmed itself,'' he said.

	   ITZHAR, West Bank (AP) _ Right-wing Jewish settlers and their
supporters demanded Wednesday a formal suspension of peace talks
with the Palestinians, hours after two Israelis were ambushed and
killed at their isolated West Bank settlement.
	   Attackers repeatedly shot the two at close range and riddled
their white four-wheel-drive vehicle with bullets, the Israeli
military said. The shootings occurred around midnight as the pair
patrolled the boundaries of the settlement of Itzhar, on a remote,
rocky hilltop outside the Palestinian-controlled city of Nablus.
	   The slain men, Harel Binoun, 18, and Shlomo Livman, 24, were
both sons of prominent right-wing rabbis, and they both were
students at a Jewish seminary in Nablus that has been a focal point
of past confrontations between Palestinians and Jewish settlers.
	   Even before the slayings, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had
been under heavy pressure from the right wing and the powerful
settler lobby to not cede more West Bank land to the Palestinians.
With the killings, that pressure intensified.
	   Several right-wing lawmakers called for parliament to return
from its summer recess and consider steps to stop the already
foundering negotiations with the Palestinians.
	   ``We will build this land, we will keep this land, and we won't
give it over to murderers,'' said lawmaker Shaul Yaalom, whose
National Religious Party has threatened to break with Netanyahu's
ruling coalition over the pullback issue.
	   Netanyahu said he viewed the attack ``very gravely'' and added
that it underscored the seriousness of Israel's security concerns.
	   Yasser Arafat, addressing Palestinian lawmakers Wednesday in the
West Bank town of Ramallah, did not mention the killings, instead
focusing on the deadlocked peace talks.
	   ``The Israeli government bears total responsibility for the
total freeze in the peace process, and the total chaos that will
engulf the entire region if the peace process is destroyed,'' he
said.
	   Israeli-Palestinian negotiations have been stalled for months
over a U.S. proposal for Israel to withdraw from an additional 13
percent of the West Bank. The two sides held two weeks of
high-level talks in an effort to restart the negotiations, but
reached no accord.
	   Settler leaders say Netanyahu's latest troop-pullback offer _
rejected Tuesday by Arafat as giving the Palestinians too little
land _ instead concedes too much territory, leaving settlements
like this one vulnerable to attack.
	   ``This is a tragic example of what is likely to occur tenfold
when troop redeployments are carried out,'' said settler leader
Ahron Dombe.
	   At an emotional memorial service in Jerusalem for the slain
settlers, some right-wing mourners interrupted a rabbi's prayer
with raucous catcalls. ``Why don't you talk about revenge?'' one
yelled.
	   ``An eye for an eye!'' said mourner Yaffa Cohen, red-faced from
anger and the stifling heat. Afterward, thousands joined in a
funeral procession back to Itzhar for the burials, breaking ground
for the settlement's first graves.
	   No arrests had been made by late Wednesday, and Israeli
officials said they believed the assailants had fled into adjacent
Palestinian-run areas.
	   There has long been bad blood between Itzhar, home to about 300
people, and its Palestinian neighbors.
	   ``I'm so angry and worried _ I can't even imagine what will
happen now,'' said Palestinian farmer Hashem Ahlan.
	   He and other villagers say settlers have stolen their livestock,
burned fields, uprooted olive trees and built roads in an effort to
grab land. Now the villagers fear reprisal attacks.
	   Ahlan's village of Ain Aboos, along with four other Palestinian
villages, was under military curfew Wednesday as Israeli soldiers
searched for suspects.

	   VALENCIA, Spain (AP) _ An abandoned three-story apartment
building collapsed Wednesday in the old quarter of Valencia,
killing a man who had been doing restoration work and leaving
another trapped in the rubble.
	   Two other workers were seriously injured, rescue services said.
	   Firemen have located the trapped worker and doctors were trying
to treat him. ``They have been able to touch his arm,'' said Laura
Navarro, spokeswoman for the Valencia regional government's rescue
services.
	   The fatality was a 34-year-old man who had suffered a heart
attack. Rescue workers found him with the aid of sniffer dogs.
Doctors tried to resuscitate him but failed.
	   A total of 12 men were on the work site when the building came
crashing down. Five managed to extricate themselves and three more
were pulled out of the rubble with only slight injuries.
	   Firemen rescued two other workers who were badly hurt. One was
hospitalized with crushed legs and another was in critical
condition with abdominal and back injuries, said Navarro.
	   The cause of the collapse was not immediately known.
	   State radio quoted people who live in the neighborhood as saying
the building was about 100 years old.

	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Fearing violence, security forces were on
alert Wednesday, a day before the state government was to release a
judge's inquiry that is expected to indict ruling party leaders for
inciting 1992 Hindu-Muslim riots in India's largest city that
killed about 800 people.
	   The Maharashtra government will present the report in the state
legislature Thursday, six months after Judge B.N. Srikrishna
completed his investigation into the rioting. The violence was
sparked by the demolition of a historic mosque in the northern town
of Ayodhya by Hindu fundamentalists. A total of about 2,000 people
were killed nationwide.
	   Human rights groups accused the government of delaying the
report because they believe it has blamed top Shiv Sena party
leaders for fomenting the rioting in Bombay.
	   ``Battalions of special police forces are in the city and all
preparations have been made to ensure that anti-social elements do
not take advantage of the situation,'' said Gopinath Munde,
Maharashtra state deputy chief minister.
	   The government says the release of the report was delayed
because it had to be translated from English into the local Marathi
language.
	   Opposition parties have held demonstrations in the city over the
last couple of months demanding immediate release of the report.
	   Police have charged a Muslim underworld don and his gang with
setting off 13 bombs in Bombay in March 1993 to avenge the attack
on the mosque.

Russia phasing in new regulations on foreign fishing fleets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Beginning this month, Russia will introduce new
regulations aimed at international fishing fleets plying its
territorial waters, a news agency reported Wednesday.
	   The regulations, governing fish caught within Russia's 200-mile
territorial boundaries, are intended to provide a more efficient
mechanism to combat poaching, Interfax said.
	   The regulations will be phased in over the next few months. They
will include new forms for reporting catches, and new methods of
reporting and controlling fishing-related revenues in foreign
currencies.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A Korean Air passenger plane skidded
off a rain-slicked runway after landing Wednesday night at Seoul's
Kimpo International Airport, injuring 22 people.
	   The flight, carrying 397 passengers from Tokyo's Narita airport,
bounced and skidded before coming to a halt in a meadow.
	   Fire engines raced to the scene as smoke rose from the plane
tilted on its right side, wheels collapsed underneath. But no
flames were reported.
	   Korean Air officials said 22 passengers were being treated for
minor bruises and abrasions in hospital. None were in serious
condition.
	   Six of those injured were Japanese and the rest were South
Korean. The Japanese were identified as Aliz Tsou, H. Arai, N.
Arai, T. Orihashi, Michihaki Miwa and Shusaburo Kimura.
	   ``People yelled all over. It was chaos. The plane moved in a
complete circle and collapsed into the meadow. I saw smoke rising
from the right engine,'' a passenger told SBS-TV.
	   Passengers and the Boeing 747-400 plane's 16 crewmen were
quickly evacuated down landing slides.
	   Pilot Lee Kwang-hee said he lost control on the slippery tarmac
after a gust slammed the plane on the touchdown.
	   The runway was closed until the wreckage could be dragged away,
causing delays for other airlines.
	   The plane left Tokyo at 4:50 p.m. (0750 GMT) and aborted landing
at Kimpo 2 1/2 hours later because of sudden rain showers. The jet
refueled in the southern resort island of Cheju before flying back
to Kimpo, where it landed about 10 p.m. (1300 GMT) airport
officials said.
	   Wednesday's accident came on the eve of the first anniversary of
the crash of Korean Air Flight 801, which slammed into a Guam
hillside on Aug. 6, 1997, killing 229 people. Only 26 people aboard
the Boeing 747 survived.
	   Korean Air adopted its present name in 1984. Until then, the
airliner had been called Korean Airlines, or KAL.
	   Sporadic heavy rains have buffeted Seoul and surrounding
provinces since Tuesday, flooding roads and submerging homes.
Across the nation, 62 people were killed and 32 remained missing in
floods caused by torrential rains.

Israel asks Poland to dismantle crosses at Auschwitz death camp
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to correct slug to conform to pvs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Israeli government asked Poland Wednesday
to dismantle controversial crosses recently erected near the
infamous Auschwitz death camp.
	   In a meeting with Poland's Ambassador to Israel, Wojciech
Adamiecki, Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh said that the
presence of 50 new crosses was inappropriate at a site where
millions of Jews were killed during the Holocaust.
	   In the past week, Roman Catholics, many linked to a conservative
radio station, erected the 50 crosses around a 26-foot-tall
(eight-meter-tall) cross put up a decade ago. Last weekend, a
nationalist movement in Silesia erected another cross, this one 10
feet (three meters ) tall.
	   The crosses have angered Jewish organizations, who want them
removed but Polish government officials have said that they do not
want to get caught up in the dispute and are leaving it to Roman
Catholic Church officials in Poland to resolve.
	   Israeli officials say the new crosses violate an agreement
reached earlier this year with the Polish government and church
authorities, banning religious, ideological or political symbols at
the site.
	   The dispute over crosses near the camp began in 1988, when the
largest one was erected to commemorate a 1979 Mass in the area
celebrated by Pope John Paul II, who is Polish. It is outside
Auschwitz, on neighboring land that used to be a Carmelite
cloister.

Iraq freezes cooperation with U.N. inspectors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Combines URGENT series; minor editing &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ President Saddam Hussein Wednesday froze
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors in protest against eight
years of economic sanctions.
	   He also demanded that a new body of weapons inspectors _ based
either in Geneva or Vienna _ be created under the supervision of a
monitoring group, representing the five permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council.
	   A government statement said Saddam has decided to ``completely
suspend cooperation'' with the U.N. Special Commission and the
International Atomic Energy Agency.
	   It said U.N. monitoring activities will, however, be allowed on
the condition that U.N. ``personnel carry out the monitoring
strictly respecting Iraq's sovereignty, security and its people's
dignity.''
	   This means that U.N. experts can no longer search suspected
weapons site in Iraq or gain access to documents. However,
monitoring cameras and sensors installed in suspected weapons sites
will remain in place.
	   The United Nations Special Commission, or UNSCOM has been
searching, monitoring and accounting for Iraq's chemical and
biological arms, nuclear program and long range missiles since 1991
in a bid to eliminate these weapons of mass destruction.
	   The sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
and have crippled the economy by banning the free sale of oil, the
country's economic lifeblood.
	   The government statement, read out on national television, said
Saddam reached the decision after chairing a meeting of the
Revolutionary Command Council, Iraq's most powerful decision-making
body, and members of the ruling Baath party.
	   It said Saddam laid down several conditions for restoring
cooperation:
	   _ the U.N. Security Council must re-establish UNSCOM.
	   _ a new executive bureau should be formed to direct the
activities of the Special Commission and its staff.
	   _ the new bureau should include an equal number of members
representing permanent members of the Security Council: United
States, Russia, France, China and Britain. Its chairmanship should
be held in rotation.
	   _ Iraq should be present in the new bureau as an observer.
	   _ The new Special Commission should move its headquarters from
the U.N. in New York to U.N. premises either in Geneva or Vienna.
	   _ The Security Council must ``legally politically and
practically adhere'' to conditions that will respect Iraq's
sovereignty and legitimate rights,'' including the no-fly zones
that U.S. and its allies set up after the Gulf War in the north and
the south.
	   _ Iraq will reserve the right to ``expel workers in the U.N.
monitoring activities who violate these legitimate conditions.''
	   Saddam's stunning decision came only hours after the move was
unanimously recommended by his rubber-stamp parliament, the
250-member National Assembly, in a six-hour debate.
	   The confrontation follows Iraq's demand this week that UNSCOM
immediately certify that the country is free of weapons of mass
destruction, a crucial step before the U.N. Security Council can
lift the sanctions.
	   Chief weapons inspector Richard Butler refused to give that
certification during his talks Monday with Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz, who immediately ended further talks.
	   Butler left Baghdad Tuesday for New York where he is scheduled
to brief the Security Council on Thursday on the deadlock.
	   Arriving in New York Wednesday, Butler said he had told Aziz the
inspectors were almost ready to certify that Iraq has destroyed its
missiles and chemical weapons.
	   He added though that inspectors needed more time to investigate
biological weapons.
	   ``We were getting there. If this were a five-lap race, we were
halfway into the fifth lap. Why stop now when you are getting
toward the finish line?'' he said.
	   Speaking before Saddam's announcement, Butler warned that if
Iraq decides to break ``cooperation with us and make a run for it
on their own, that is very serious. And the Security Council will
have to deal with that.''
	   Butler is scheduled to meet with U.N. chief Kofi Annan later
Wednesday.
	   During the last crisis earlier this year _ triggered by Iraq's
refusal to allow inspectors into presidential palaces _ U.S. and
British forces rushed to the Gulf and were poised to attack Iraq.
Annan's personal mediation averted the crisis _ and a war.
	   In Iraq, the official line is that the U.N. inspectors are
American stooges.
	   Foreign Minister Sahhaf accused the inspectors of creating the
crisis by provoking Iraq. The inspectors ``are cops of the dirty
American type,'' he said.
	   ``This is enough. Iraq cannot continue with this ploy,'' Oil
Minister Amer Mohammed Rashid told reporters during a break in the
Parliament debate.

 &UR; With Iraq

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler said
Wednesday that he did not view the collapse of disarmament talks
with Iraq as ``a crisis.''
	   His comments came hours before Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
froze cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors to protest eight
years of economic sanctions.
	   Saddam's move followed after Iraq's 250-member National Assembly
voted unanimously earlier Wednesday to cut off cooperation.
Legislators voted after a new dispute with the weapons inspectors
charged with determining whether Iraq has eliminated its weapons of
mass destruction.
	   Butler said Iraq's demand that he inform the U.N. Security
Council that Baghdad no longer has any weapons of mass destruction
was ``puzzling'' because of Iraq's progress toward disarmament in
several areas.
	   In comments made before Saddam's move, Butler said if Iraq
decides to break ``cooperation with us and make a run for it on
their own, that is very serious. And the Security Council will have
to deal with that.''
	   Butler, who arrived in New York on Wednesday via London, said he
would present his findings to the Security Council on Thursday, but
would meet with Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Wednesday ``and see
where we go.''
	   The international sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in
1990, sparking the Gulf War, cannot be lifted until the U.N.
inspectors certify Iraq has destroyed all its chemical and
biological weapons and long-range missiles. The sanctions ban Iraq
from freely exporting its most valuable commodity _ oil.
	   At the United Nations, Yuriy Fedotov, Russia's No. 2
representative to the organization, said Wednesday that the
breakdown in talks must not be blamed entirely on Iraq.
	   ``Sure, we are concerned about what happened in Baghdad, but we
are strongly convinced that Iraq is not the only one to blame for
this situation,'' Fedotov said after the Security Council met

consulting Annan and the Security Council. Fedotov said further
deterioration of the situation must be prevented, and ``still there
is hope that a major crisis can be prevented.''
	   Over the years, he said, cooperation has resulted in much being

18 killed as firing continues along India's border for seventh day

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with the Pakistan military sources reporting 11 dead
on their side, raising the total death toll to 120. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Hundreds of Indian villagers in the
Himalayan state of Kashmir fled their homes Wednesday as Indian and
Pakistani soldiers traded mortar shells across their disputed
frontier, killing 18 people and wounding 17 others, officials said.
	   At least 120 people have been killed since Thursday in one of
the heaviest and most prolonged peacetime duels between the two
enemies. The two countries have fought three wars in the last 50
years, two of them over Kashmir.
	   Defense Minister George Fernandes told India's Parliament that
47 Indians, including 31 civilians, have been killed, and 160 have
been wounded. That number didn't include the seven people killed
and 17 wounded since Tuesday night.
	   In Islamabad, Pakistan military sources reported 11 people _ all
civilians _ died Wednesday in their part of Kashmir. A total of 66
Pakistanis have been killed from the Indian fire, almost all
civilians.
	   Fernandes reiterated New Delhi's accusation that Indian soldiers
are intercepting militants trained and armed by Islamabad to fight
its proxy war in Kashmir.
	   ``These actions by Pakistan are in consonance with its
calculated design to obstruct and stall peaceful bilateral dialogue
and to create a sense of alarm,'' Fernandes said.
	   In Islamabad, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said the situation at
the boundary was in danger of escalating.
	   ``The Indian pounding ... is almost unprecedented for its
ferocity and the huge quantity of ammunition fired,'' the spokesman
said. Indian soldiers have fired more than 20,000 rounds across the
border, he said. It was not immediately clear how many rounds
Pakistani soldiers fired.
	   Officials in Srinagar, capital of the India-held area of
Kashmir, said four paramilitary policemen were killed when mortar
shells fell on their camp Tuesday night. Five others were injured
in the shelling at Jabla in the Uri region of Kashmir, 120
kilometers (75 miles) north of Srinagar.
	   Two civilians were killed and three injured in the same area
shortly after midnight, said the officials, who cannot be
identified under briefing rules. Nine civilians were injured by
fire farther north in the Kupwara district. One soldier was killed
in the Poonch sector, 280 kilometers (175 miles) southwest of
Srinagar.
	   Dozens of villagers fled their homes in Uri following the
shelling, officials said. Many others along the border have been
moving to safety in the last few days.

Russians failing to keep peace, Georgian official says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Russian troops are failing to keep the
peace in Georgia's separatist region of Abkhazia and new
peacekeeping measures must be found, Georgia's foreign minister
said Wednesday.
	   Having returned from a meeting of the U.N. Security Council on
the Abkhazian issue, Irakly Menagarishvili insisted that Georgia is
dissatisfied with the performance of Russian peacekeepers.
	   Recent fighting, he told a news conference, ``has convinced us
of the inability of the peacekeeping forces to protect civilians
and, more important, to prevent large-scale armed clashes between
the conflicting sides.''
	   He did not say whether he thought the Security Council would
consider replacing the Russian troops with U.N. peacekeepers, as
Georgia has asked.
	   The Security Council agreed last week to keep U.N. military
observers in Georgia for another six months and condemned the
recent violence.
	   An estimated 40,000 ethnic Georgian refugees fled the Ghali
region in May during fighting between Abkhazian separatists and
militia groups that support Georgia's central government.
	   The Russian peacekeepers were sent to stabilize the Black Sea
province of Abkhazia in 1994 following a war in which Abkhazian
separatists drove out Georgian government troops.
	   Large-scale fighting has ended, but sporadic clashes continue
despite the peacekeepers' presence, and Georgian officials have
accused the Russian troops of favoring the separatists.
	   Menagarishvili said the possibility of replacing the Russians
with troops from another former Soviet republic would be discussed
at an upcoming meeting of the Commonwealth of Independent States, a
loose alliance of ex-Soviet states.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Wednesday
froze cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors to protest eight
years of economic sanctions against his country.
	   Saddam's move came hours after Iraq's 250-member National
Assembly voted unanimously to cut off cooperation and called for an
end to sanctions. Legislators voted after a new dispute with the
weapons inspectors charged with determining whether Iraq has
eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Saddam decided after a meeting with senior officials to
``completely suspend cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission
and the International Atomic Energy Agency,'' a government
statement said.
	   The announcement means that U.N. experts can no longer search
suspected weapons site in Iraq, a mission that the U.N. commission
has been carrying out since 1991 in a bid to eliminate Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction.
	   Still, Saddam said he would exempt U.N. monitoring activities in
Iraq from his decision, meaning that cameras and sensors installed
in suspected weapons sites can remain in place.
	   Saddam issued several conditions for restoring cooperation,
including changing the makeup of the commission and who oversees
its inspectors.

Portugal, Indonesia agree to discuss autonomy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series; UPDATES with reaction from Horta; that
agreement does not prejudice earlier principles; minor editing. No

 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC;

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Portugal and Indonesia have agreed to
discuss granting the troubled province of East Timor autonomy and
to further involve East Timor activists in the talks, foreign
ministers said Wednesday.
	   Both agreements, announced after two days of talks brokered by
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, were concessions.
	   Portugal, the province's colonial master until 1975, previously
backed nothing short of self-determination for East Timor.
Indonesia had insisted that it should remain the only avenue to
appraise the East Timorese of any progress in negotiations.
	   Wednesday's agreement assigned that task to Annan, who would be
able to contact East Timorese of his choosing. Annan said he would
seek input from East Timorese leaders within and without the
province.
	   Both sides said Wednesday's agreement was ``without prejudice''
to their prior basic principles.
	   Annan described the deal as ``progress,'' but said he did not
regard it as a breakthrough.
	   He said he would include among his contacts Jose Ramos Horta, a
leading East Timorese independence activist and co-winner of the
1996 Nobel Peace Prize based in Lisbon _ and previously anathema to
the Indonesians.
	   In Lisbon, Horta said Annan should also consult with jailed
rebel chief Xanana Gusmao.
	   Another apparent concession by Indonesia was Alatas' pledge that
Gusmao would be released in the context of an ``overall solution.''
	   Habibie previously offered to release Gusmao in exchange for
international recognition of Indonesia's claim to the province,
which has not been forthcoming since its annexation in 1976.
	   ``It's not a global solution,'' Portuguese Foreign Minister
Jaime Gama said of the agreement, which calls for a solution by the
end of this year. But ``we have moved from principled positions to
common ground,'' he said.
	   A working paper prepared last week by Annan's special envoy to
the region, Jamsheed Marker, was optimistic, anticipating movement
on the issue because of democratic reforms promised by President
B.J. Habibie.
	   The autonomy, proposed by Indonesia, would allow East Timorese
full governance except in the areas of foreign affairs, external
defense, and some monetary policies, said Indonesia Foreign
Minister Ali Alatas.
	   It would not mean a full withdrawal of forces, he said.
	   ``There may be a residue of forces there, but in much more
reduced form,'' Alatas said.
	   About 600 soldiers will leave East Timor on Saturday, completing
a withdrawal of 1,000 troops, the Indonesian military said
Wednesday.
	   Indonesia has promised to release other political prisoners in
the territory as the talks progress.
	   No mention was made of East Timorese demands for a referendum on
independence among the province's 800,000 people _ a proposal
previously backed by Portugal.
	   The two sides also agreed to allow Indonesia to open up an
interest section in a ``friendly embassy'' in Lisbon _ most likely,
Thailand's embassy.
	   Portugal's interests in Jakarta are represented by the embassy
of the Netherlands.
	   Habibie replaced former autocratic leader Suharto as president
in May, and pledged democratic reforms and greater flexibility on
East Timor, a half island territory about 2,000 kilometers (1,200
miles) east of Jakarta.

Hurdles world champ ends season with leg ailment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ World champion hurdler Ludmila Engquist
said Wednesday she is withdrawing for the rest of the season
because of injuries to her left leg.
	   Engquist, who won the 100 hurles in Athens and also was a 1996
Olympic gold medalist, strained muscles while training in June,
then hurt her hamstring in late July.
	   The latter injury ``caused a lot of pain when I came down from
the hurdles,'' she told a news conference.
	   The Russian-born Engquist had been seen as a strong contender
for the European Athletics Championships title in Budapest this
month. But she said the decision to drop out was the right one.
	   ``The last two nights, I've been able to sleep well for the
first time in two months,'' she said, according to the Swedish news
agency TT.

Bangladesh seeks international aid to help flood victims

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ The Bangladesh Red Crescent has
appealed for dlrs 1.7 million in international aid after four weeks
of heavy rains and floods killed at least 350 people and left
thousands of others homeless, an official said Wednesday.
	   The appeal was sent to the Geneva-based International Red Cross.
Nearly 42,000 people are afflicted by diarrhea and other waterborne
diseases in 35 Bangladesh districts. Forty people have died from
such illnesses, said Shamsul Islam, a top official of the disaster
and relief ministry.
	   The government was taking care of nearly 130,000 people living
in temporary camps. But the Bangladesh Red Cross says it needs
international assistance for more than 20 million people affected
by the floods.
	   The flood situation in Dhaka, the Bangladesh capital, and two
nearby districts has deteriorated following fresh rains over the
past three days.
	   More than 500 people were being treated daily at the
International Center for Diarrheal Diseases and Research, said Dr.
Ishtiaq Zaman, a spokesman for the center. The number was expected
to rise because heavy monsoon rains were expected to last until
mid-September.
	   Nearly 3,500 paramedics have reached flood-hit areas. More than
50,000 bags of oral saline have been distributed among the affected
people in Dhaka and nearby districts.
	   Bangladesh is a delta region ravaged by floods every year.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A military court in southern
Yugoslavia sentenced four Kosovo Albanians to prison Wednesday for
smuggling large amounts of weapons into the country and clashing
with border guards, media reported.
	   The four, three adults and one minor, were sentenced to serve 13
and 8 years, respectively, state-run Tanjug news agency reported. A
military court in Nis, convicted them of illegally entering the
country from neighboring Albania last April, exchanging fire with
border guards and carrying large amounts of weapons destined for
the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   All four all were ethnic Albanians from the secessionist
province of Kosovo, in Yugoslavia's dominate republic of Serbia
	   Also Wednesday in the town of Pec, authorities began criminal
proceedings against another 5 ethnic Albanians as suspected
terrorists, who had been captured in fighting.
	   Clashes between Serb military forces and Albanians fighting for
Kosovo's independence have escalated since March, when Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic ordered a crackdown rebels.

Riot police disperse students with tear gas in Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Riot police fired tear gas Wednesday to
disperse hundreds of Sudanese students protesting an increase in
university fees.
	   Ater the tear gas, police with nightsticks and in riot-control
vehicles chased students down three streets in central Khartoum,
witnesses told The Associated Press.
	   Shops along al-Gomhuriya, al-Hurriya and al-Zubair streets
closed and owners fled the area, the witnesses said.
	   There were no immediate reports of injuries.
	   In Cairo, the opposition National Democratic Alliance said the
students were also protesting against the death of a student who
died Tuesday of brain hemorrhage in police detention.
	   Mohammed Abdel-Salam, a law student, had been arrested with
several colleagues at a Khartoum University hostel on Monday, the
alliance said in a fax to the AP.
	   The alliance groups northern and southern parties, including the
Sudan People's Liberation Army, who are opposed to the
military-backed government of President Omar el-Bashir.
	   University tuition was virtually free until 1992 when the
government began imposing and raising fees. Students now pay at
least 70,000 pounds (dlrs 38) a year in this impoverished African
nation where the minimu monthly wage is dlrs 8. Senior government
officials earns an average of dlrs 75 a month.
	   It was not immediately clear how much the fees have been
increased.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ As rebels reportedly captured two major
towns and advanced on a third in troubled eastern Congo, President
Laurent Kabila's government on Wednesday accused one-time ally
Rwanda of deploying soldiers across the border to deepen the
revolt.
	   ``Almost 400 army soldiers have come from Rwanda and have caused
Congolese bloodshed,'' Congolese government spokesman Didier
Mumengi said Wednesday.
	   A leader of the mutineers, however, went on air on a rebel-held
radio station in the eastern town of Goma near Rwanda's border and
denied the uprising was anything but home-grown.
	   ``This is a struggle of the Congolese people,'' said Arthur
Z'Ahidi Ngoma, who was named rebel leader by a group of former
government supporters, opposition officials and soldiers in the
eastern town of Goma on Tuesday night, according to the rebel-held
station.
	   Ngoma, a veteran opposition figure who was briefly jailed by
Kabila's regime, refuted the government's accusations that the
revolt was ethnically-driven or spurred by invaders deployed by
Rwanda's Tutsi-led government.
	   Rwanda's President Pasteur Bizimungu also denied his country had
reason to be involved in the conflict, but left open the
possibility for future intervention.
	   ``We do not know what the outcome will be like in Congo ... If
there should be any serious reasons to be involved, maybe we should
(become involved),'' Bizimungu said during an official visit to
Zambia.
	   Hostilities subsided Wednesday in the two largest towns in
Congo's eastern Kivu region _ Goma and Bukavu _ where rebels had
taken control, according to the rebel station and Rwanda's state
radio.
	   Fierce fighting, however, was reported in Uvira, further south
of Bukavu, in the South Kivu province, where rebels were believed
to be advancing.
	   On the other side of Congo on the Atlantic coastline, an
exchange of gunfire was seen Tuesday in the western village of
Kitona, although it was not clear who controlled the town or its
military base.
	   An unknown number of people were killed in the fighting,
government officials said on condition of anonymity.
	   That battle began after rebel gunmen forced an airplane they had
hijacked to land in Kitona, about 225 kilometers (140 miles)
southwest of the capital of Kinshasa. The hijackers were believed
to be ethnic Tutsis _ known as Banyamulenge _ fighters in the
eastern city of Goma.
	   In Kinshasa, a truck convoy loaded with troops was seen rumbling
out of the city headed to the east.
	   Although Kinshasa was stunned by brief gun battles in two army
barracks on Monday, the mood in the city was relatively calm as Red
Cross workers collected bodies left in the street from fighting two
days before.
	   Several Kinshasa businesses owned by ethnic Tutsis were
reportedly robbed and burned by gangs of local residents as a
dusk-to-dawn curfew was repealed.
	   Two Tutsi groups _ Banyamulenge and former Rwandan troops who
stayed in the country after helping Kabila overthrow former
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in May last year _ were believed to be
leading the revolt against Kabila, accusing him of corruption and
nepotism.
	   The rebellion began about a week after Kabila ordered all
Rwandan troops out of the country. He did not explain the move.
	   A Rwandan official, who asked not to be further identified, said
Bizima Karaha, an ethnic Tutsi and Congo's foreign minister had
arrived in Goma, apparently to take up sides with the rebels.
	   Karaha, who was fired by Congo's president on Wednesday, did not
return to Kinshasa from South Africa as scheduled earlier this
week, giving rise to speculation that he sought political asylum in
South Africa.
	   Zimbabwe announced plans Wednesday to host a regional summit on
Friday to discuss the Congo crisis. The governments of Congo,
Rwanda, Zambia, Namibia and Uganda had expressed willingness to
attend, an official in Harare said.

Kucera advances, Gustafsson upset
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Top-seeded Slovakian Karol Kucera
on Wednesday claimed a quarterfinal berth in the clay court Grolsch
Open, ousting Dane Thomas Larsen, 7-5, 6-3.
	   But Romanian qualifier Adrian Voinea came back from a set down
in his second round match to upset third-seeded Magnus Gustafsson
of Sweden, 4-6, 6-1, 6-3.
	   Voinea started weakly but grew stronger as the match progressed
and forced Gustafsson into the corners of the court with subtle and
varied shots.
	   Morrocan Hicham Arazi, who was disqualified Tuesday for
unsportsmanlike conduct in his match against Swede Magnus Norman,
is to lose his prize money of dlrs 4,770.
	   He is also likely to be fined for the incident, in which he
deliberately slammed balls out of court, but ATP Tour officials
declined to comment on the fine before informing the player
himself.
	   The three other remaining seeds in this dlrs 500,000 tourney at
the Bosbaan tennis complex on the edge of Amsterdam all strolled
through to the quarterfinals with straight sets victories.
	   Defending champion Slava Dosedel, seeded eighth this year, put
an end to the hopes of initially nervous Dutch teen-age prodigy
Martin Verkerk, 6-4, 6-4.
	   Australian No. 6 seed Richard Fromberg eliminated another
Dutchman Dennis van Scheppingen 6-3, 6-4 and the No. 7 seed,
Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia, ousted Spaniard Albert Portas 6-1, 6-2.
	   And in unseeded play, Argentinian Mariano Zabaleta, fresh from
his Tuesday first-round upset of Spanish second seed Felix
Mantilla, downed Costa Rican Juan Antonio Marin 6-1, 7-6 (7-5).

Human testing expected on anti-addiction drug
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VERENA DOBNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Human testing is expected to begin this fall on
a drug that appears to block cocaine addiction in laboratory
animals and might have promise for use against other addictions.
	   Scientists from the U.S. Department of Energy's Brookhaven
National Laboratory held a news conference Wednesday to describe
their tests of the ability of gamma vinyl-GABA, or GVG, to curb
cocaine cravings in rodents and monkeys.
	   The drug could be an improvement over methadone, the most
commonly used antidote to cocaine addiction in three decades, said
Dr. Jonathan Brodie, a New York University psychiatry professor who
collaborated on the federally funded research.
	   While methadone is itself addictive, the new drug is not. ``This
is like if you craved candy and you went to a candy store to get
it, only now the cupboards are bare _ so you stop going to the
candy store,'' Brodie said.
	   The scientists said they believe the drug has the potential to
also curb addiction to substances such as nicotine, heroin and
amphetamines.
	   ``If this can do for humans what it did for animals, we may have
opened the door for addicts around the world to kick their habit,''
said Stephen Dewey, a brain-science expert at Brookhaven and lead
author of the report.
	   The drug, now used for treatment of epilepsy in Europe and
Canada, is marketed by Hoechst Marion Roussel, a unit of Hoechst AG
in Germany.
	   Brookhaven researchers became interested in it because it
reduces the level of a brain chemical called dopamine, which causes
the ``high'' feelings from drugs.
	   Cocaine appears to increase dopamine production. But lab animals
given GVG in addition to cocaine retained normal levels of
dopamine.
	   Tests on human volunteers would begin as soon as the Food and
Drug Administration approves the GVG for use in the United States.
Final FDA approval is expected in October, according to Brookhaven.
	   Results of the Brookhaven work, sponsored by the Department of
Energy's research department and the National Institute of Mental
Health, were released Wednesday by the journal Synapse.

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Rescuers recovered six bodies Wednesday from a
Berlin apartment building demolished a day earlier by a natural gas
explosion.
	   Hundreds of police and firefighters working with dogs and heat
and sound sensors continued to search for one resident still
missing. Workers used a crane, bulldozer and other heavy equipment
to dig through the rubble.
	   Hopes were raised that rescuers would find 13-year-old Sven
Tornow alive after his small, white dog was rescued unharmed.
However, the boy's was one of the six bodies recovered, along with
two elderly women, a woman of about 40, a 70-year-old man, and
another man found lying on a sofa.
	   The boy was home alone when the early morning blast collapsed
the four-story apartment building, ripping it off its foundation
and sending a huge cloud of dust over the Steglitz neighborhood.
	   His father was at work and his mother already in a new apartment
that the family planned to move into on Friday.
	   Fire chief Alfred Broemme blamed natural gas for the explosion.
However, police were still investigating the cause.

Chemical workers shut down fuel pumps
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ No negotiations were planned
between 40,000 striking South African chemical workers and
management as the work stoppage dragged into its third day, union
president Welile Nolingo said on Wednesday.
	   The workers in the Chemical Workers' Industrial Union continued
to stick to their demands for a 10.5 percent pay increase, 40 hour
work week, sick leave and a starting wage of 2,000 rand (dlrs 330)
a month.
	   The union represents workers in the petroleum, plastics, glass,
rubber, pharmaceutical and industrial chemical industries.
	   One company had obtained a court ruling to prevent strikers from
stopping fuel deliveries from a refinery in Durban. On Tuesday,
police fired rubber bullets to disperse workers at a Cape Town
fertilizer plant.
	   A random survey of local gas stations by the South African Press
Association found that more than 18 stations in Johannesburg,
Pretoria and Durban had been forced to close for lack of fuel. Some
received new deliveries on Wednesday.
	   In Pretoria, 40 of 58 employees at a British Petroleum depot
were striking, leaving nine delivery trucks standing idle, a
spokesman said.
	   Meanwhile, auto workers were threatening to strike on Friday,
despite agreement between the 21,000-strong National Union of
Metalworkers and employers on an 8 percent wage increase.
	   Car makers are resisting union demands that workers be paid 2
percentage points above inflation for two years after 1999, Dow
Jones Newswires reported. South African inflation was more than 6
percent over the past year.
	   German, Japanese and American automobile producers have plants
that employ 35,000 people. Another 100,000 work in related
industries.
	   The Automobile Manufacturers Employers' Organization chairman
Brian Smith said the strike would threaten more than 4 billion rand
(dlrs 655 million) in export contracts.

Disney offer could triple NHL's TV take
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSH DUBOW &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Walt Disney Co. has offered to pay the North
American National Hockey League close to dlrs 600 million for
exclusive U.S. television rights for five years on the ABC network
and ESPN sports cable channel, industry sources told The Associated
Press on Wednesday.
	   The offer, originally reported at dlrs 400 million in
Wednesday's Wall Street Journal, would nearly triple the amount
paid yearly to the league by ESPN and the Fox network.
	   A Fox source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
network was notified of the offer by the league and is deciding
whether to make a counterbid for the NHL package before an Aug. 14
deadline.
	   But it is unlikely Fox would substantially increase its rights
fees for the NHL while ratings are slipping. Fox earned a 1.4
rating this season, down from a 2.0 in 1995. A rating point
represents about 980,000 households in the United States.
Regular-season ratings fell 17 percent on ESPN and were flat on
ESPN2, ESPN's sister channel.
	   Fox's five-year, dlrs 155 million contract with the league
expires after next season, as does ESPN's dlrs 100 million,
seven-year deal. The networks will pay a combined dlrs 60 million
to the NHL this coming season.
	   The proposed deal also comes at a time when ESPN and cable
operators are battling over the rates the network charges systems
to carry ESPN and ESPN2. After agreeing to pay dlrs 600 million a
year for the rights to the pro gridiron National Football League,
more than double the previous deal, ESPN increased the rates it
charges cable operators by about 20 percent.
	   But an ESPN source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
this deal would have ``no direct bearing on our affiliate fee
situation.''
	   The Journal, citing sources familiar with the offer from ABC and
ESPN, said the two Disney-owned units made the pitch to NHL
commissioner Gary Bettman this week at league meetings in
Nashville, Tennessee.
	   An NHL spokeswoman declined comment, as did a spokesman for ABC.

Kuwait Parliament approves dlrs 7.97 billion budget
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait's Parliament approved a 2.44 billion dinars
(dlrs 7.97 billion) budget for 1998-99 Wednesday in a move that is
expected to widen the deficit by 21.5 percent.
	   Faced with a projected expenditure of 4.36 billion dinars (dlrs
14.25 billion), the deficit will reach 1.92 billion dinars (dlrs
6.27 billion) in the fiscal year 1998-99, which began July 1.
	   Kuwait will make up the shortfall from its reserves. The budget
did not propose any new taxes.
	   The deficit for the current year is 1.58 billion dinars (dlrs
5.16 billion).
	   The deficit figures exclude money set aside for the Kuwait's
Fund for Future Generations, which the budget regards as an
expenditure. The fund's estimated assets of dlrs 40 billion are
invested around the world to provide Kuwaitis with income after the
nation's oil runs out.
	   The National Assembly passed the budget by 33 votes to 0, with
one abstention. The vote was called only in the final hours before
the summer recess.
	   Legislators accepted without change the budgetary
recommendations of the assembly's finance committee.
	   The budget's revenue is based on an expected oil price of dlrs
10 a barrel, down considerably from the dlrs 13 a barrel used to
calculate the current budget.
	   Kuwait's oil revenues, the mainstay of the economy, have been
hit hard since November when the world price began to slide. The
revenues are projected to fall to 1.89 billion dinars (dlrs 6.18
billion) in the next fiscal year.
	   Total revenues for the fiscal 1997-98 are projected to be 3.10
billion dinars (dlrs 10.13 billion).
	   The oil revenue figures are based on crude output of 1.98
million barrels a day, which is in line with Kuwait's production
pledges as a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.
	   Estimated expenditure is virtually unchanged at 4.36 billion
dinars (dlrs 14.25 billion) for fiscal 1998-99, compared with 4.37
billion dinars (dlrs 14.28 billion) this fiscal year.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A military court in southern
Yugoslavia sentenced four Kosovo Albanians to prison Wednesday for
smuggling large amounts of weapons into the country and clashing
with border guards, media reported.
	   The three adults and one minor, were sentenced to serve 13 and 8
years, respectively, state-run Tanjug news agency reported. A
military court in Nis, convicted them of illegally entering the
country from neighboring Albania last April, exchanging fire with
border guards and carrying large amounts of weapons destined for
the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   All four all were ethnic Albanians from the secessionist
province of Kosovo, in Yugoslavia's dominate republic of Serbia
	   In the town of Pec Wednesday, authorities began criminal
proceedings against another 5 ethnic Albanians as suspected
terrorists, who had been captured in fighting.
	   Clashes between Serb military forces and Albanians fighting for
Kosovo's independence have escalated since March, when Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic ordered a crackdown on the rebels.

U.N. stresses `territorial integrity' in Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations stressed the importance
of maintaining the sovereignty of Congo on Wednesday, lending muted
support to Laurent Kabila's embattled government.
	   Messages from the Security Council and from Secretary-General
Kofi Annan expressing concern about recent fighting emphasized
``the need to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
the Democratic Republic of Congo.''
	   Kabila has accused neighboring Rwanda of sending troops across
its borders, where ethnic Tutsi rebels reportedly captured two
major eastern towns.
	   Rwanda has denied the charge although Rwandan troops _ one-time
allies of Congo's president _ remain in the country against
Kabila's wishes.
	   International support for Kabila has substantially waned since
he unseated the longtime dictator of what was once Zaire, Mobutu
Sese Seko, in May 1997.
	   The lack of support stems partly from Kabila's failure to
improve human rights and to allow international inspectors to visit
alleged massacre sites, and partly from his inabilty to control its
porous borders.
	   Annan was especially incensed earlier this year when Kabila
forced out a U.N. team of inspectors.
	   Annan's statement included a pointed reminder ``to all concerned
... to respect the human rights of all.''

Text of Lambeth Conference statement on homosexuality
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Anglican Conference

<TEXT>
	   CANTERBURY, England (AP) _ Text of statement on homosexuality
adopted Wednesday by Anglican bishops at the Lambeth Conference:
	   The conference
	   ``(a) commends to the church the subsection report on human
sexuality;
	   ``(b) in view of the teaching of Scripture, upholds faithfulness
in marriage between a man and a woman in lifelong union, and
believes that abstinence is right for those who are not called to
marriage;
	   ``(c) recognizes that there are among us persons who experience
themselves as having a homosexual orientation. Many of these are
members of the church and are seeking the pastoral care, moral
direction of the church, and God's transforming power for the
living of their lives and the ordering of relationships, and we
commit ourselves to listen to the experience of homosexual people.
We wish to assure them that they are loved by God and that all
baptized, believing and faithful persons, regardless of sexual
orientation, are full members of the body of Christ.
	   ``(d) while rejecting homosexual practices as incompatible with
Scripture, calls on all our people to minister pastorally and
sensitively to all irrespective of sexual orientation and to
condemn irrational fear of homosexuals, violence within marriage
and any trivialization and commercialization of sex;
	   ``(e) cannot advise the legitimizing or blessing of same-sex
unions, or ordination of those involved in same-gender unions;
	   ``(f) requests the primates and the ACC (Anglican Consultative
Council) to establish a means of monitoring the work done on the
subject of human sexuality in the communion and to share statements
and resources among us.
	   ``(g) notes the significances of the Kuala Lumpur Statement and
the concerns expressed in resolutions IV.26, V.1, V.10, V.23 and
V.35 on the authority of Scripture in matters of marriage and
sexuality and asks the primates and the ACC to include them in
their monitoring process.''

Israel asks Poland to dismantle crosses at Auschwitz death camp
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Israeli government asked Poland Wednesday
to dismantle controversial crosses recently erected near the
infamous Auschwitz death camp.
	   In a meeting with Poland's Ambassador to Israel, Wojciech
Adamiecki, Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh said that the
presence of 50 new crosses was inappropriate at a site where
millions of Jews were killed during the Holocaust.
	   In the past week, Roman Catholics, many linked to a conservative
radio station, erected the 50 crosses around a 26-foot-tall
(eight-meter-tall) cross put up a decade ago. Last weekend, a
nationalist movement in Silesia erected another cross, this one 10
feet (three meters) tall.
	   The crosses have angered Jewish organizations, who want them
removed but Polish government officials have said that they do not
want to get caught up in the dispute and are leaving it to Roman
Catholic Church officials in Poland to resolve.
	   Israeli officials say the new crosses violate an agreement
reached earlier this year with the Polish government and church
authorities, banning religious, ideological or political symbols at
the site.
	   The dispute over crosses near the camp began in 1988, when the
largest one was erected to commemorate a 1979 Mass in the area
celebrated by Pope John Paul II, who is Polish. It is outside
Auschwitz, on neighboring land that used to be a Carmelite
cloister.

Netanyahu: Israel to invest in military responses to Iranian
</HEADLINE>
missile

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Wednesday that Israel will respond to a recent Iranian missile test
by investing in military responses to meet the new threat.
	   Speaking before high ranking military and intelligence officials
at a graduation ceremony at Israel's National Security College,
Netanyahu said Israel must face the reality that Iran and other
nations may turn ballistic weapons on the Jewish state.
	   ``This (threat) demands investment of national resources and
allowances over the next few years. I plan to present this in
internal meetings and ultimately before the government,'' Netanyahu
said.
	   A recent test of the Shahab-3 missile by Iran has received
prominent media coverage in Israel. Israel believes the missile is
capable of reaching its civilian populations and could eventually
be adapted to carry non-conventional warheads.

Azerbaijani president calls on opposition to drop election boycott
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The president of Azerbaijan appealed to opposition
leaders Wednesday not to boycott the Oct. 11 presidential election,
but said he would not grant them any more concessions.
	   Leaders of several leading opposition parties have refused to
take part in the election until the government meets their demands,
which include the establishment of an independent elections
commission.
	   Although the government has granted some demands, it will not
give in to any others, presidential spokesman Ramiz Mekhtiyev said
at a news conference in Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, according to
Russian and Azerbaijani news agencies.
	   Nevertheless, President Geidar Aliev issued an appeal to three
opposition figures, calling on them to participate in the
elections. Aliev, who was Azerbaijan's Soviet-era Communist Party
boss, came to power in a bloodless military coup in June 1993. He
is running for re-election.
	   According to the ITAR-Tass news agency, Aliev directed his
appeal to Alfubaz Elchibin, chairman of the National Front and
former president of Azerbaijan; Isa Gambar, chairman of the Musabad
Party and a former speaker of parliament; and Lala-Shorket
Gadzhieva, leader of the Liberal Party and Aliev's former chief of
staff.

Newspaper's license revoked for insulting Khomeini
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's hard-line judiciary on Wednesday
permanently revoked the license of a newspaper for publishing a
letter criticizing the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
	   The newspaper's managing director, Mohammad-Reza Za'eri, was
given a suspended six month prison sentence and fined 3 million
rials (dlrs 990), the state television reported.
	   In handing down the verdicts, a media court said Za'eri and his
weekly newspaper, Khaneh, had insulted ``Islam's sacred principles
... and the sanctities of the Iranian nation and the values of the
Islamic Revolution,'' the TV said.
	   The letter that Khaneh published criticized Khomeini's role in
the 1980-1988 war with Iraq.
	   Za'eri published the letter taking advantage of the free-press
policy being pushed by President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate
cleric who came to power a year ago.
	   But Khatami's efforts have met strong opposition from the
hard-line clergymen who control the judiciary, the powerful arm of
the government that has the power to revoke publishing licenses.
	   Khomeini, the leader of Iran's 1979 revolution, has been
elevated almost to the level of sainthood by the ruling clergy, and
public criticism of him taboo.
	   In the letter, an unidentified woman wrote: ``When I think of
Khomeini, all that comes to mind are the horrifying sounds of the
midnight bombs that used to fall on Tehran, and the blood of
thousands of innocent young Iranians who died in that war.''
	   ``Do you call me to follow someone who has transformed Iran into
an international terrorist state with his order to murder Salman
Rushdie?'' the letter said, referring to Khomeini's order to kill
Rushdie for insulting Islam in his novel, ``The Satanic verses.
	   On July 27, militants threw a small petrol bomb at Khaneh's
office and threatened further violence if the paper didn't change
its policies. No one was injured in the incident.

Arab League says Sudan should remain united
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Arab League welcomed on Wednesday peace
talks between the Sudanese government and southern rebels but
stressed that Africa's biggest nation should remain united in any
settlement.
	   On Wednesday, representatives of the Sudanese government and
rebels held a second day of peace talks in Ethiopia. The talks
concentrated on the boundaries of southern Sudan and the role of
the Islam in that region.
	   In May, the government and the Sudan People's Liberation Army
agreed in principle to hold an internationally supervised
referendum on possible independence for southern Sudan _ but they
did not agree on the territory involved.
	   ``The secretariat-general of the Arab League expresses its hope
that this round leads to achieving peace and ending the war in
southern Sudan,'' said the statement by the 22-member Arab League.
	   But the statement added that the league ``reconfirms its fixed
stance based on preserving the unity of Sudan's peoples and
territories.''
	   The SPLA has been fighting various governments since 1983 for
greater autonomy for the south, which is the largely African,
Christian and animist, from the Islamic and Arab north. More than
1.5 million people have died in the fighting and resulting famines.
	   The Cairo-based Arab League also urged ``all sides to respond to
the international community's call for a cease-fire to enable
humanitarian relief'' to meet the latest threat of famine in
southern Sudan.

France Telecom mulls future of phone boxes in age of cellular
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Might cellular phones soon spell the end of French
public phone boxes?
	   That's what unions feared Wednesday after France Telecom said it
planned to study ways of replacing phone boxes in non-profitable
areas ``on a case-by-case basis.''
	   A France Telecom document, obtained Wednesday by unions,
outlined a need for ``radical changes'' regarding the installation
of phone boxes in non-profitable areas.
	   The document said a reduction in the use of public phone boxes
so far this year was ``not a surprise'' given the popularity of
cellular phones.
	   In June, around 7.8 million people in France had a cellular
phone _ roughly one in ten of the population.
	   The document proposed ``limiting ourselves strictly to equipping
the most profitable sites ... and the disinvestment of loss-making
sites.''
	   Pierre Khalfat, federal secretary of the SUD-PTT union, said
Wednesday that scaling back the number of phone boxes would ``run
contrary to France Telecom's mission to serve the public.''
	   ``Outside my home, there's a queue to use the phone box, but
only in the evening,'' he said. ``It's not as profitable as one in
a commercial center, but it's needed.''
	   Jacques Rivals, marketing chief of France Telecom's public phone
sector, said the company, ``on a case-by-case basis,'' would ``seek
replacement solutions in consultation with local communities.''
	   ``Our goal is to adapt to public demand,'' Rivals said. ``That's
also a way of serving the public.''

Combat continues in pre-inauguration rebel offensive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JARED KOTLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Combat raged in nearly a third of
Colombia's 32 provinces Wednesday, continuing a three-day leftist
rebel offensive that authorities said has killed about 125 people.
	   The attacks by Colombia's two largest rebel groups _ the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, and the National
Liberation Army, or ELN _ began late Monday.
	   The guerrillas set off bombs in cities and towns and hit police
and army units with rockets, grenades mortars and machine-gun fire.
	   Military leaders have condemned the rebels, saying they are
violating pledges to seek peace with incoming president Andres
Pastrana, who takes office Friday.
	   The rebels have given no reason for the offensive, however
political analysts said they were trying to gain leverage in
eventual negotiations.
	   Despite the fighting, Pastrana said he'll go ahead with peace
initiatives toward both groups _ which have been fighting since the
1960s.
	   The bloodiest fighting was in the town of La Uribe, in Meta
province, and in Miraflores, in Guaviare province. Both are
southern strongholds of the 15,000-member FARC, the strongest rebel
group.
	   The rebels attacked La Uribe early Tuesday, killing 37 soldiers
and one police officer before capturing 16 soldiers and retreating
into nearby mountains, said Mayor Ernesto Rodriguez in a radio
interview. Eight guerrillas were also killed, Rodriguez said.
	   In Miraflores, residents interviewed by radio said guerrillas
have destroyed the army post and a police anti-narcotics base.
	   Police reported that rebels killed six officers and three
soldiers, but an international aid official said as many as 40
soldiers died in the attack.
	   The army has not confirmed the deaths or reports that 22
soldiers missing in Miraflores were seized by the rebels.
	   The army also reported that fighting in Pavarando, in central
Antioquia province, left 10 soldiers and two civilians dead.

Russian hostage released in Chechnya

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A police officer held hostage in Chechnya for the
past month returned to his home in southern Russia on Wednesday
after his colleagues and family helped free him, a news agency
reported.
	   Police Sgt. Mavledin Gasanov had been kidnapped from the Russian
republic of Dagestan in early July and held in captivity in
neighboring Chechnya, ITAR-Tass said.
	   His colleagues were able to establish his whereabouts, and his
family secured his release, the agency said.
	   The report did not say who had kidnapped Gasanov or whether his
family paid any ransom. It also did not say when he was freed,
although it said he crossed the border into Dagestan on Tuesday
evening.
	   Chechnya, the breakaway region that considers itself independent
of Russia, has been plagued by kidnappings for the past couple of
years. Most involve demands for ransom.

King Hussein orders investigation into drinking water pollution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Working from his hospital bed in America,
Jordan's King Hussein has ordered an investigation into the
pollution of drinking water in Amman, Jordan Television said
Wednesday.
	   Hussein worked the telephone and sent e-mails Tuesday,
instructing his brother and regent, Crown Prince Hassan, to set up
a five-member committee chaired by the justice ministry's secretary
general, the television said.
	   Hussein is undergoing medical treatment at Mayo Clinic in the
United States for cancer
	   The television said Prince Hassan asked the government to
provide alternative source of water while it tries to control the
pollution in the piped water supply.
	   Amman residents have complained for the past three weeks that
water flowing out of taps has an odor and contains worms and
larvae.
	   Newspapers say that the head of the Consumer Protection Society,
Abdul Fatah Kilani, plans to sue the ministers of health and water
works.
	   Public criticism of the government escalated Wednesday with
newspapers urging citizens to initiate legal actions against
``possible official negligence and corruption.''

Anglican bishops condemn homosexual relations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with comment from bishops of Newark, Dallas
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANTERBURY, England (AP) _ Anglican bishops declared Wednesday
that homosexual relations are ``incompatible with Scripture,''
expressed opposition to the ordination of practicing homosexuals
and affirmed traditional teachings that sex is permissible only
within marriage.
	   After a two-and-a-half-hour debate, participants in the
once-a-decade conference took a stronger line than their leader,
Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey, who wanted the issue
referred for further study.
	   The resolution was adopted on a vote of 526 to 70, with 45
bishops abstaining. It was a defeat for liberal bishops, most
notably those in Europe and the United States.
	   ``Homosexual practice is nowhere recognized in Scripture ... It
is condemned in both Old and New Testaments as an immoral act, and
therefore a sin,'' said the Rt. Rev. Eustace Kamanyire, Bishop of
Ruwenzori in Uganda.
	   Bishops who ordain homosexuals or bless same sex unions are
``undermining the faith'', he said.
	   African bishops have backed an even stronger motion that
condemns homosexuality and says to do otherwise would be
``evangelistic suicide.'' But the Rt. Rev. Catherine Roskam of New
York said such strong statements would hamper the work of the
church in the United States.
	   The Rt. Rev. Duncan Buchanan, the Bishop of Johannesburg, South
Africa, said the draft statement offered to the conference was
designed to bridge strongly held differences.
	   ``It does not commend anything other than traditional attitudes
toward marriage and chastity,'' Buchanan said.
	   But a series of amendments adopted by the conference took a
stronger line, especially the clause ``rejecting homosexual
practice as incompatible with Scripture.''
	   The Rt. Rev. David Crawley, Bishop of Kootenay in Canada,
complained that the amendments ``bit by bit, step by step'' were
giving the resolution ``the face of condemnation.''
	   Liberal bishops won a concession with an amendment that
committed church leaders ``to listen to the experience of
homosexual people.''
	   The Rt. Rev. James Stanton, bishop of Dallas and head of the
traditionalist American Anglican Council, welcomed the vote.
	   ``The willingness of so many American church leaders to try to
legitimize homosexual behavior has foisted this difficult
discussion on the worldwide church. It has sapped our energy from
urgent tasks such as evangelism and justice for the poorest of the
poor,'' Stanton said. ``It is time for those bishops and others who
seek to revise orthodox Christian teaching to submit to the mind of
the whole church and the teaching of scripture.''
	   But the Right Rev. John Spong, bishop of Newark, N.J. and a
vigorous advocate for homosexuals, was unbowed.
	   ``We have achieved a great victory here, this issue is now at
the front and center of the Anglican Communion and at the next
conference I predict there will be openly out gay bishops,'' Spong
told reporters after the vote.
	   The votes demonstrated growing influence of generally
conservative bishops in Third World countries and Asia, whose
churches were established by missionaries from the Church of
England.
	   Some bishops were annoyed the homosexual issue had come to the
top of the conference agenda, above their concerns on international
debt.
	   During the debate, the moderator of the Church of South India,
the Most Rev. Vasant Dandin, called for a time limit on the debate
and objected to the amount of time devoted to ``a trivial
business.''
	   The Rt. Rev. Michael Lugor of Sudan said that Christian martyrs
would laugh that the bishops were debating this issue.
	   ``In Sudan, we know nothing of homosexuality. We only know the
Gospel,'' Lugor said.
	   Carey expressed his satisfaction with the resolution and said he
firmly believed in the traditional teachings of sex only within
marriage. But he said he was concerned that differences could widen
into divisions and urged both sides to respect and listen carefully
to each other.
	   The Lambeth Conference _ which drew more than 700 bishops,
including 11 women, this year _ has no authority to regulate
doctrine among the national churches, but it is the main
consultative body for Anglicans.

Security Council: Feuding Afghan forces must resume talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Afghanistan-Fighting &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Concerned about mounting fighting in
Afghanistan, the Security Council called Wednesday for peace talks
and warned of a deteriorating humanitarian situation.
	   Forces opposed to the ruling Taliban religious militia are
backed into a small corner of northern Afghanistan, and the Taliban
appears poised to capture all of the country.
	   ``The Security Council is deeply concerned at the dangerous
escalation of the armed conflict, and it stresses the need to end
the bloodshed,'' Slovenian Ambassador Danilo Turk, president of the
Security Council, said after the council was briefed privately on
the latest fighting.
	   The council, Turk said, wants a peaceful dialogue between the
warring parties.
	   He also said council members expressed ``grave concern'' about
the serious deterioration of the humanitarian situation in the
country and protested the Taliban's expulsion of several
international aid agencies from the capital, Kabul.
	   Taliban authorities expelled 200 aid workers for 38 agencies
last month because they refused to move into a dilapidated
dormitory on the outskirts of the capital. Aid workers have said
their absence could put thousands in the city at risk.
	   The Red Cross and the United Nations were not affected by the
relocation order.
	   The Taliban, which captured Kabul in 1996, has imposed a strict
version of Islamic law in territory it controls. Taliban officials
have barred girls from school and confined most women to their
homes.
	   The anti-Taliban alliance is made up mostly of Afghanistan's
religious and ethnic minorities.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A military court in southern
Yugoslavia sentenced four Kosovo Albanians to prison Wednesday for
smuggling large amounts of weapons into the country and clashing
with border guards, media reported.
	   The four, three adults and one minor, were sentenced to serve 13
and 8 years, respectively, the state-run Tanjug news agency
reported. A military court in Nis convicted them of illegally
entering the country from neighboring Albania last April,
exchanging fire with border guards and carrying large amounts of
weapons destined for the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   All four all are ethnic Albanians from the secessionist province
of Kosovo, in Yugoslavia's dominant republic of Serbia.
	   Defense lawyer Azem Vlasi said the charges were ``not supported
with valid proof,'' calling the verdict political.
	   Also Wednesday in the town of Pec, authorities began criminal
proceedings against another five ethnic Albanians who were captured
in fighting and are suspected of terrorism.
	   Clashes between Serbian military forces and Albanians fighting
for Kosovo's independence have escalated since March, when Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic ordered a crackdown on rebels.

Netanyahu: Israel to invest in military responses to Iranian
</HEADLINE>
missile &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Wednesday that Israel will respond to a recent Iranian missile test
by investing in military responses to meet the new threat.
	   Speaking before high ranking military and intelligence officials
at a graduation ceremony at Israel's National Security College,
Netanyahu said Israel must face the reality that Iran and other
nations may turn ballistic weapons on the Jewish state.
	   ``This (threat) demands investment of national resources and
allowances over the next few years. I plan to present this in
internal meetings and ultimately before the government,'' Netanyahu
said.
	   A recent test of the Shahab-3 missile by Iran has received
prominent media coverage in Israel. Israel believes the missile is
capable of reaching its civilian populations and could eventually
be adapted to carry non-conventional warheads.

Anglican bishops condemn homosexual relations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with comment from bishops of Newark, Dallas
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANTERBURY, England (AP) _ Anglican bishops declared Wednesday
that homosexual relations are ``incompatible with Scripture,''
expressed opposition to the ordination of practicing homosexuals
and affirmed traditional teachings that sex is permissible only
within marriage.
	   After a two-and-a-half-hour debate, participants in the
once-a-decade conference took a stronger line than their leader,
Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey, who wanted the issue
referred for further study.
	   The resolution was adopted on a vote of 526 to 70, with 45
bishops abstaining. It was a defeat for liberal bishops, most
notably those in Europe and the United States.
	   ``Homosexual practice is nowhere recognized in Scripture ... It
is condemned in both Old and New Testaments as an immoral act, and
therefore a sin,'' said the Rt. Rev. Eustace Kamanyire, Bishop of
Ruwenzori in Uganda.
	   Bishops who ordain homosexuals or bless same sex unions are
``undermining the faith'', he said.
	   African bishops have backed an even stronger motion that
condemns homosexuality and says to do otherwise would be
``evangelistic suicide.'' But the Rt. Rev. Catherine Roskam of New
York said such strong statements would hamper the work of the
church in the United States.
	   The Rt. Rev. Duncan Buchanan, the Bishop of Johannesburg, South
Africa, said the draft statement offered to the conference was
designed to bridge strongly held differences.
	   ``It does not commend anything other than traditional attitudes
toward marriage and chastity,'' Buchanan said.
	   But a series of amendments adopted by the conference took a
stronger line, especially the clause ``rejecting homosexual
practice as incompatible with Scripture.''
	   The Rt. Rev. David Crawley, Bishop of Kootenay in Canada,
complained that the amendments ``bit by bit, step by step'' were
giving the resolution ``the face of condemnation.''
	   Liberal bishops won a concession with an amendment that
committed church leaders ``to listen to the experience of
homosexual people.''
	   The Rt. Rev. James Stanton, bishop of Dallas and head of the
traditionalist American Anglican Council, welcomed the vote.
	   ``The willingness of so many American church leaders to try to
legitimize homosexual behavior has foisted this difficult
discussion on the worldwide church. It has sapped our energy from
urgent tasks such as evangelism and justice for the poorest of the
poor,'' Stanton said. ``It is time for those bishops and others who
seek to revise orthodox Christian teaching to submit to the mind of
the whole church and the teaching of scripture.''
	   But the Right Rev. John Spong, bishop of Newark, N.J. and a
vigorous advocate for homosexuals, was unbowed.
	   ``We have achieved a great victory here, this issue is now at
the front and center of the Anglican Communion and at the next
conference I predict there will be openly out gay bishops,'' Spong
told reporters after the vote.
	   The votes demonstrated growing influence of generally
conservative bishops in Third World countries and Asia, whose
churches were established by missionaries from the Church of
England.
	   Some bishops were annoyed the homosexual issue had come to the
top of the conference agenda, above their concerns on international
debt.
	   During the debate, the moderator of the Church of South India,
the Most Rev. Vasant Dandin, called for a time limit on the debate
and objected to the amount of time devoted to ``a trivial
business.''
	   The Rt. Rev. Michael Lugor of Sudan said that Christian martyrs
would laugh that the bishops were debating this issue.
	   ``In Sudan, we know nothing of homosexuality. We only know the
Gospel,'' Lugor said.
	   Carey expressed his satisfaction with the resolution and said he
firmly believed in the traditional teachings of sex only within
marriage. But he said he was concerned that differences could widen
into divisions and urged both sides to respect and listen carefully
to each other.
	   The Lambeth Conference _ which drew more than 700 bishops,
including 11 women, this year _ has no authority to regulate
doctrine among the national churches, but it is the main
consultative body for Anglicans.

Newspaper's license revoked for insulting Khomeini
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's hard-line judiciary on Wednesday
permanently revoked the license of a newspaper for publishing a
letter criticizing the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
	   The newspaper's managing director, Mohammad-Reza Za'eri, was
given a suspended six month prison sentence and fined 3 million
rials (dlrs 990), the state television reported.
	   In handing down the verdicts, a media court said Za'eri and his
weekly newspaper, Khaneh, had insulted ``Islam's sacred principles
... and the sanctities of the Iranian nation and the values of the
Islamic Revolution,'' the TV said.
	   The letter that Khaneh published criticized Khomeini's role in
the 1980-1988 war with Iraq.
	   Za'eri published the letter taking advantage of the free-press
policy being pushed by President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate
cleric who came to power a year ago.
	   But Khatami's efforts have met strong opposition from the
hard-line clergymen who control the judiciary, the powerful arm of
the government that has the power to revoke publishing licenses.
	   Khomeini, the leader of Iran's 1979 revolution, has been
elevated almost to the level of sainthood by the ruling clergy, and
public criticism of him taboo.
	   In the letter, an unidentified woman wrote: ``When I think of
Khomeini, all that comes to mind are the horrifying sounds of the
midnight bombs that used to fall on Tehran, and the blood of
thousands of innocent young Iranians who died in that war.''
	   ``Do you call me to follow someone who has transformed Iran into
an international terrorist state with his order to murder Salman
Rushdie?'' the letter said, referring to Khomeini's order to kill
Rushdie for insulting Islam in his novel, ``The Satanic Verses.''
	   On July 27, militants threw a small petrol bomb at Khaneh's
office and threatened further violence if the paper didn't change
its policies. No one was injured in the incident.

Study: Screening cuts deaths in young athletes with heart defect
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: For release at 2100 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Screening young athletes for a rare heart defect
can prevent some sudden deaths during competitive sports, a study
found.
	   The study in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine looked
at 33,735 athletes younger than 35 in Padua, Italy, who were
screened from 1979 to 1996 for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
	   People suffering from that condition, a birth defect involving
heart muscle enlargement and an overly vigorous heartbeat, can die
suddenly if they overexert themselves.
	   Of deaths among young people studied, only one involved an
athlete with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, accounting for 2 percent
of the sudden deaths among competitive athletes. And among the 22
athletes disqualified from competitive sports because of a
diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, none died.
	   A previous U.S. study found that 36 percent of sudden deaths
among young athletes were caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
	   Annual screening for the condition is required by law in Italy
for young people who want to play competitive sports while U.S. law
does not require screening tests.
	   The Italian screening included: a personal and family history of
heart disease; a physical examination; an exercise test; and an
electrocardiogram. Those with signs of heart problems were given an
echocardiogram and other specialized tests.
	   The study, led by Dr. Domenico Corrado of the University of
Padua, found heart defects were responsible for nearly all the
sudden deaths among young athletes.

<TEXT>
	   VALENCIA, Spain (AP) _ An abandoned three-story apartment
building collapsed Wednesday in Valencia's old quarter, killing two
men who had been doing restoration work and pinning others under
the rubble for hours.
	   A total of 12 men were on the work site when the building came
crashing down. Five managed to extricate themselves and three more
were pulled out with slight injuries.
	   Two others were seriously hurt, suffering crushed limbs or
internal injuries, rescue services said.
	   The interior ministry said two workers died, the state news
agency Efe reported.
	   One of the fatalities was a 34-year-old man who suffered a heart
attack. Rescue workers found him with the aid of sniffer dogs.
Doctors tried to resuscitate him but failed.
	   A second body remained trapped under the rubble more than four
hours after the building collapsed. Firemen were using construction
equipment to try to get to it.
	   The cause of the accident was not immediately known.
	   State radio quoted people who live in the neighborhood as saying
the building was about 100 years old.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Human testing is expected to begin this fall on
a drug that appears to block cocaine addiction in laboratory
animals and might have promise for use against other addictions.
	   Scientists from the U.S. Department of Energy's Brookhaven
National Laboratory held a news conference Wednesday to describe
their tests of the ability of gamma vinyl-GABA, or GVG, to curb
cocaine cravings in rodents and monkeys.
	   The drug could be an improvement over methadone, the most
commonly used antidote to heroin addiction in three decades, said
Dr. Jonathan Brodie, a New York University psychiatry professor who
collaborated on the federally funded research.

<TEXT>
	   CONCORD, New Hampshire (AP) _ People who suffer from mild to
moderate Crohn's disease, a chronic inflammation of the digestive
tract, get more relief from a new drug than the standard treatment,
researchers found.
	   The study published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine found that 9 milligrams daily of slow-release budesonide
led to remission of the disease in 69 percent of patients after
eight weeks. Mesalamine capsules, the standard treatment, caused
remission in 45 percent.
	   The effect of both drugs decreased slightly after 16 weeks of
treatment.
	   Crohn's disease affects an estimated 500,000 Americans. Symptoms
may include pain, fever, diarrhea and weight loss.
	   Moderate to severe cases are treated with corticosteroids that
can have serious side effects, including suppression of the immune
system, excessive hair growth, cataracts and glaucoma.
	   Budesonide is a new corticosteroid that is less easily absorbed
and causes fewer side effects, making it safe enough for patients
with mild to moderate Crohn's disease, Drs. Stephen Bickston and
Fabio Cominelli, of the University of Virginia, wrote in an
accompanying editorial.
	   Budesonide, sold as Entocort by Astra Draco of Sweden, has not
been approved yet by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
	   The study, led by Dr. Ole Ostergaard Thomsen of the University
of Copenhagen in Denmark, was paid for by Astra Draco and carried
out at 25 hospitals and clinics in several countries.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard
Butler on Wednesday said the collapse of disarmament talks with
Iraq was not ``a crisis'' _ but he suggested Iraq had planned to
break up the talks even before his arrival.
	   His comments came as Iraqi President Saddam Hussein froze
cooperation Wednesday with U.N. weapons inspectors to protest eight
years of economic sanctions.
	   Butler arrived at the United Nations on Wednesday, 48 hours
after the talks broke down, to meet with U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan and review a list of Iraqi conditions for reopening the
talks.
	   He said Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz effectively cut off the
talks Monday evening.
	   ``Tariq Aziz demanded of me that I wave a magic wand over their
weapons program and say they're finished, shazam, the wand,
finished,'' Butler said as he waited for an elevator in the U.N.
lobby. ``And I said I can't do that, I need evidence.''
	   Butler said he asked Aziz if he thought it was worth resuming
the talks the next day.
	   ``He said no, unless you're prepared in advance to agree to my
point of view,'' he said. ``If anyone broke off these talks, it
wasn't me, it was Tariq Aziz
	   Earlier, during a brief stopover in London, Butler played down
talk of a crisis.
	   When he spoke to Annan on Monday night from Baghdad after the
talks collapsed, ``I very specifically told him that I don't think
any of us should describe this as a crisis,'' Butler told BBC Radio
4.
	   At the United Nations, Butler said that his inspectors told them
they reported for inspections as usual Wednesday.
	   ``We went out this morning in a normal way,'' he said, adding
that the Iraqis met them ``in a normal and courteous way.''
	   Butler said he believed that Aziz's refusal to compromise was
planned well in advance.
	   ``I think in a way, they were foreshadowing this,'' he said.
	   A letter last week from the U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon to the
Security Council said Iraq expected Butler to ``recognize that the
requirements ... have been met'' at this week's meeting.
	   Saddam's freeze followed after Iraq's 250-member National
Assembly voted unanimously earlier Wednesday to cut off
cooperation.
	   The international sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in
1990, sparking the Gulf War, cannot be lifted until the U.N.
inspectors certify Iraq has destroyed all its chemical and
biological weapons and long-range missiles. The sanctions ban Iraq
from freely exporting its most valuable commodity _ oil.
	   Yuriy Fedotov, Russia's No. 2 representative to the United
Nations, said the breakdown in talks must not be blamed entirely on
Iraq.
	   Butler, he said, decided to break off the dialogue without duly
consulting Annan and the Security Council, and ignored real
progress on the part of the Iraqis.
	   Butler called that view ``extraordinary.''
	   ``What is at issue here here is the decisions of the Security
council which are binding in international law,'' he said.
``Whether or not Iraq is prepared to accept that law is what is at
issue.''
	   Butler said he found Aziz's stance puzzling because the
commission is close to saying Iraq has no weapons of mass
destruction in some areas.
	   ``In the missile area, we're very close. In the chemical weapons
area, we're very close. We're not close in the biological weapons
area. And that's what was most puzzling to me _ that he should
insist on this ... claim that everything is done, because he knows
very well that that's far from true in the biological area,''
Butler said.
	   He said Aziz continued to refuse to hand over a document found
last month by U.N. weapons inspectors, detailing types of bombs and
rockets that Iraq has said were used to deliver chemical and
biological agents.
	   ``Tariq Aziz refused to give it to me and said 'you will never
get it.'''

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Wall Street close in 7th graf. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Wall Street's big drop rattled investor sentiment
around the world, sending share prices lower Wednesday from Asia to
Europe before the New York Stock Exchange reopened with possible
signs of stability.
	   Blue chips on Europe's biggest markets lost about 2 percent of
their value, although many shares managed to finish above the lows
they hit during a hectic trading day.
	   ``It is unpleasant and nasty _ a white-knuckle ride,'' said
Jeremy Batstone, an analyst at Natwest Stockbrokers in London.
	   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
closed with a loss of 103.6 points, or 1.8 percent, at 5,632.5.
Earlier, the so-called ``footsie'' had been down by almost 2.9
percent on Europe's biggest market.
	   Frankfurt's DAX index finished its afternoon electronic trading
session with a loss of 1.8 percent, similar to the losses by the
CAC 40 in Paris.
	   Some analysts urged shareholders not to panic _ but all eyes
were on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average closed
with a gain of 59.47 _ or 0.7 percent _ at 8,546.78.

Greene beats Boldon in the men's 100

 &UR; By STEPHAN NASSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ World champion Maurice Greene got off
to a perfect start and edged his training partner Ato Boldon by
six-hundredths of a second in the 100 meters at the DN Galan Grand
Prix meet Wednesday.
	   ``I had a very good start and that's what produced the finish,''
said Greene, whose winning time of 9.90 was the fifth-fastest of
the season and only .06 off the world record. ``In the heats I had
a little problem. I was feeling a bit tight with the cold and
rain.''
	   Brian Lewis and Jon Drummond, two other Americans, placed fourth
and fifth in identical times of 10.06.
	   Bruny Surin, who had a 9.89 in beating world-record holder and
Olympic champion Donovan Bailey in the Canadian Championships last
weekend, finished a disappointing eighth and last in 10.24.
	   Greene's previously fastest time this season was 9.96, recorded
in the U.S. Championships in New Orleans in June. Boldon, the
fastest man of the year, twice ran 9.86.
	   In addition to appearance money, Greene earned a one-carat
diamond valued at dlrs 10,000 for setting a new Olympic Stadium
record. Boldon won the race last year with Greence finishing
runnerup.
	   ``The only thing that Ato has that I don't have from Stockholm
was the diamond,'' said Greene, who spent a week in the Swedish
capital training for the meet with Boldon and their coach John
Smith.
	   Boldon, the world 200-meter champion from Trinidad, actually ran
a faster time in the heats, clocking a 9.89, the fourth fastest
time of the year. Greene won the first heat in 10.05.
	   ``The thing is he got one of those starts you can't do anything
about ...'' Boldon said. ``I spent the whole race trying to catch
him. The difference in the margin at the finish was the margin he
had at the start.''
	   Daniel Komen of Kenya failed in an attempt to regain the world
5,000-meter record but won the race in 12:58.64. Haile Gebrselassie
of Ethiopia broke Komen's old mark, set last year, with a time of
12:39.36 in June in Helsinki, Finland.
	   Tyree Washington won the men's 400 in 44.78, leading a 1-2
United States finish. Alvin Harrison was second in 45.09. Jerome
Young, a member of the American quartet that broke the 4 x
400-meter relay world record in the recent Goodwill Games, only
managed fourth in 45.39.
	   Wilson Boit Kipketer, who ran a world seasonal best of 8:01.05
last month in Stuttgart, led a Kenyan 1-2-3 sweep in the 3,000
steeplechase, winning the race in 8:06.13.
	   Bernard Barmasai, who set the world record of 8:07.09 a year ago
in Cologne, Germany, placed second in 8:07.09 and Paul Kosgei third
in 8:10.23.
	   ``I don't think it's very likely that a new record will come
this season,'' Kipketer said. ``I'll be running in Zurich, but
honestly I thought my best chance was in Stockholm. I love this
stadium, its people and the track!''
	   Jonathan Edwards of Britain, another world-record holder
competing in a stadium where more world marks (83) have been set
than any other stadium in the world, won the triple jump with a
last-round effort of 16.99.
	   Zohra Ouaziz of Morocco clocked a seasonal best of 14:40.19 in
the women's 5,000 meters. Paula Radcliffe of Britain was a distant
second in 14:51.27.
	   Another U.S. 1-2 came in the women's 100 hurdles, with Melissa
Morrison winning the event in 12.53 for a stadium record and a
diamond in addition to prize money. Angela Vaughn was second in
12.67.
	   Chrystie Gaines of the United States took the 100 meters in
10.95, finishing .02 ahead of Debbie Ferguson of the Bahamas.
Merlene Ottey, the semi-retired veteran from Jamaica, was third in
11.01.
	   ``Usually, something happens to let me win in Stokholm,'' Gaines
said. ``In 1996 a couple of people pulled out, in 1997 I was
injured but now I have come here and Marion pulls out. This meet is
my good-luck charm.''
	   Marion Jones, who has dominated the women's sprints in the past
two years and winner of another Swedish race Monday in Malmo,
withdrew because of a sore thigh.
	   Former world champion Maria Mutola of Mozambique won the women's
800 in 1:56.71 for another Olympic Stadium record.

<TEXT>
	   HUELVA, Spain (AP) _ A lifeguard rescued a toddler clinging to
her father's dead body after he suffered a heart attack while
swimming in the Atlantic, the Civil Guard said.
	   The incident occurred Wednesday at a beach in the town of La
Antilla in the southern province of Huelva.
	   The three-year-old girl was rescued as she floated about 100
meters offshore. ``She was lying on top of her father's body,'' a
Civil Guard official said.
	   He said the man had turned 40 on Tuesday.
	   The girl, identified as Gloria Samaniego, was hospitalized in
the provincial capital. Officials there refused to discuss her
condition.

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Combat raged in nearly a third of
Colombia's 32 provinces Wednesday, continuing a three-day leftist
rebel offensive that authorities said has killed about 125 people.
	   The attacks by Colombia's two largest rebel groups _ the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, and the National
Liberation Army, or ELN _ began late Monday.
	   The guerrillas set off bombs in cities and towns and hit police
and army units with rockets, grenades mortars and machine-gun fire.
	   The U.S. government and Colombian military leaders have
condemned the rebels, saying they are violating pledges to seek
peace with incoming president Andres Pastrana, who takes office
Friday.
	   ``We look for the day when the guerrillas' deeds match their
pledges of peace,'' said a U.S. State Department comment issued by
the U.S. embassy spokesman in Bogota.
	   The rebels have given no reason for the offensive, however
political analysts said they were trying to gain leverage in
eventual negotiations.
	   Despite the fighting, Pastrana said he'll go ahead with peace
initiatives toward both groups _ which have been fighting since the
1960s.
	   The bloodiest fighting was in the town of La Uribe, in Meta
province, and in Miraflores, in Guaviare province. Both are
southern strongholds of the 15,000-member FARC, the strongest rebel
group.
	   The rebels attacked La Uribe early Tuesday, killing 37 soldiers
and one police officer before capturing 16 soldiers and retreating
into nearby mountains, said Mayor Ernesto Rodriguez in a radio
interview. Eight guerrillas were also killed, Rodriguez said.
	   In Miraflores, the U.S. spokesman said, the entire town
including an anti-narcotics base had been overrun and as many as
200 police and army personnel ``are missing and presumed either
dead or disappeared.''
	   The spokesman also denied local radio reports that U.S.
anti-narcotics personnel were present during the attack and
kidnapped by rebels.
	   The army has not confirmed the deaths in Miraflores or that
soldiers were seized by the guerrillas, but an international aid
official said as many as 40 soldiers died.
	   The army also reported that fighting in Pavarando, in central
Antioquia province, left 10 soldiers and two civilians dead.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Rebels reportedly captured two major
centers and advanced on others in troubled eastern Congo where
President Laurent Kabila's government on Wednesday accused one-time
ally Rwanda of deploying soldiers across the border to deepen the
revolt.
	   ``Almost 400 army soldiers have come from Rwanda and have caused
Congolese bloodshed,'' Congolese government spokesman Didier
Mumengi said Wednesday.
	   A leader of the mutineers, however, went on air on a rebel-held
radio station in the eastern town of Goma near Rwanda's border and
denied the uprising was anything but home-grown.
	   ``This is a struggle of the Congolese people,'' said Arthur
Z'Ahidi Ngoma, who was named rebel leader by a group of former
government supporters, opposition officials and soldiers in the
eastern town of Goma on Tuesday night, according to the rebel-held
station.
	   Ngoma, a veteran opposition figure who was briefly jailed by
Kabila's regime, refuted the government's accusations that the
revolt was ethnically-driven or spurred by invaders deployed by
Rwanda's Tutsi-led government.
	   Rwanda's President Pasteur Bizimungu also denied his country had
reason to be involved in the conflict, but left open the
possibility for future intervention.
	   ``We do not know what the outcome will be like in Congo ... If
there should be any serious reasons to be involved, maybe we should
(become involved),'' Bizimungu said during an official visit to
Zambia.
	   Rwanda's forces played a key role in Kabila's victory last year
over longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. But that delicate
alliance of Kabila's rebels, Rwandan troops and Banyamulenge Tutsis
from Congo has unraveled and now threatens to topple the current
government.
	   Hostilities subsided Wednesday in the two largest towns in
Congo's eastern Kivu region _ Goma and Bukavu _ where rebels had
taken control, according to the rebel station and Rwanda's state
radio.
	   Fierce fighting, however, was seen in the Uvira, further south
of Bukavu, in the South Kivu province, where rebels were believed
to be advancing.
	   A brief exchange of artillery and small weapons fire in the
northeastern city of Kisangani was heard in the city, according to
several aid groups based in the capital of Kinshasa. An unnamed
defense ministry official, however, insisted loyalist troops were
not under threat.
	   On the other side of Congo on the Atlantic coastline, an
exchange of gunfire was seen Tuesday in the western village of
Kitona, although it was not clear who controlled the town or its
military base.
	   An unknown number of people were killed in the fighting,
government officials said on condition of anonymity.
	   That battle began after rebel gunmen landed in Kitona, about 225
kilometers (140 miles) southwest of the capital of Kinshasa, in a
hijacked plane.
	   The rebels were believed to be Tutsis _ known as Banyamulenge _
fighters in the eastern city of Goma.
	   In Kinshasa, a truck convoy loaded with troops was seen rumbling
out of the city headed to the east.
	   Although Kinshasa was stunned by brief gun battles in two army
barracks on Monday, the mood in the city was relatively calm as Red
Cross workers collected bodies left in the street from fighting two
days before.
	   Several Kinshasa businesses owned by ethnic Tutsis were
reportedly robbed and burned by gangs of local residents as a
dusk-to-dawn curfew was repealed.
	   Two Tutsi groups _ Banyamulenge and former Rwandan troops who
stayed in the country after helping Kabila overthrow former
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in May last year _ were believed to be
leading the revolt against Kabila, accusing him of corruption and
nepotism.
	   The rebellion began about a week after Kabila ordered all
Rwandan troops out of the country. Kabila did not explain the move.
	   A Rwandan official, who asked not to be further identified, said
Bizima Karaha, an ethnic Tutsi and Congo's foreign minister had
arrived in Goma, apparently to take up sides with the rebels.
	   Karaha, who was fired by Congo's president on Wednesday, did not
return to Kinshasa from South Africa as scheduled earlier this
week, giving rise to speculation that he sought political asylum in
South Africa.
	   Zimbabwe announced plans Wednesday to host a regional summit on
Friday to discuss the Congo crisis. The governments of Congo,
Rwanda, Zambia, Namibia and Uganda had expressed willingness to
attend, an official in Harare said.

Prosecutor files charges against Schering directors

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ A state prosecutor on Wednesday filed
criminal charges against two directors of the local subsidiary of
German pharmaceutical maker Schering AG, whose phony birth control
pills are blamed for several unwanted pregnancies.
	   Some 20 women have reported they became pregnant after taking
fake Microvlar contraceptives, which the company said were intended
solely to test new packaging equipment. The placebo tablets, made
of lactose and sugar, were supposed to have been incinerated after
the tests, but were stolen and sold illegally.
	   Prosecutor Pedro Manoel Ramos said he filed charges against the
company's chief executive officer, Rainer Bitzer and its industrial
director, Valter Schenk for violating the consumer defense law.
	   ``They are responsible for the company's failure to identify the
placebos as such, for failing to promptly notify authorities that
the tablets had been stolen, and for the distribution of a product
unfit for human consumption,'' Ramos said by phone.
	   If the charges are accepted by a judge, Bitzer and Schenk will
be tried and could face prison terms of up seven years and four
months.
	   Neither Bitzer not Schenk were available for immediate comment,
but a company spokesman said Schering would appeal. Schering is not
related to Madison, New Jersey-based Schering-Plough Corp., which
has launched an advertising campaign to notify consumers of that
fact.
	   Some 650,000 packages, containing 21 placebos each, were
manufactured. It is unclear how many packages were stolen and
distributed.
	   The company has already appealed a fine equivalent to dlrs 2.5
million for taking more than a month to notify health authorities
that the phony contraceptives had been stolen.

	   ORAHOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The graves are fresh mounds of dirt
and garbage, the names of the dead, if known, marked on crude
wooden stakes. Serb police said Wednesday this is where they buried
ethnic Albanians, enfuriating local leaders who called the site a
garbage dump.
	   The crude burial ground holds victims of last month's fighting
in Orahovac, one of the ugliest battles in five months of war in
Kosovo province. Police claimed 40 bodies are here, hoping to
disprove reports of Serbs burying ethnic Albanians in multiple or
mass graves.
	   What happened in Orahovac has been controversial from the start,
with ethnic Albanians claiming hundreds of civilians were massacred
and Serb forces denying it.
	   For days, Serb forces have been attacking and burning ethnic
Albanian villages. And allegations of mass graves heightened fears
that Serb forces, in their campaign to crush ethnic Albanian
rebels, are trying to ``ethnically cleanse'' Kosovo of its Albanian
population.
	   European Union monitors who visited Orahovac said they found no
evidence Wednesday of mass graves at the site, on a hillside on the
outskirts of town.
	   A prominent ethnic Albanian politicians also saw the graves.
Afterward, Veton Surroi said as many as 200 Albanians were killed
in the town, most of them in a mosque where they had taken refuge,
repeating accounts described by survivors who said they saw the
slaughter.
	   Standing near the graves, Serb police spokesman Col. Bozdar
Filic denied the site was a garbage dump, claiming that ``somebody
made a mess'' afterward. He said the bodies were buried there
because of the Muslim cemetery just meters (yards) away.
	   The trash mixed with dirt appeared to have been long-buried and
churned up with grave digging _ apparently by the bulldozer still
at the scene. A pile of rotting garbage and a dead cow nearby gave
off a sickening stench.
	   Eight grave markers had ethnic Albanian names. The rest had only
numbers, because they were unidentified, said the police spokesman,
who gave the Serbs' most complete version yet of how many people
died at Orahovac.
	   He said 58 ethnic Albanian bodies were found after the four-day
battle that started July 18. The bodies were taken to a morgue in
Prizren, a nearby city. Families claimed five bodies, and police
buried the others, he said.
	   Forty bodies are buried in Orahovac, 11 in Prizren and two at
another site near Orahovac. Filic insisted the bodies were
``correctly buried,'' but gave no details. He said a local judge
supervised the interments, which took place July 20-Aug. 3.
	   The question of mass graves arose after European newspapers
reported Wednesday that more than 500 ethnic Albanians were buried
in Orahovac, most of them children. The reports cited gravediggers
who claimed to have buried the bodies for the Serbs.
	   ``The rumors about mass graves are a product of Albanian
terrorist leaders to distract attention from their heavy defeats,''
Filic said.
	   All the dead were ``terrorists,'' the spokesman said, referring
to the Kosovo Liberation Army fighting to sever the predominantly
Albanian province from the Serb republic that dominates Yugoslavia.
	   The burial ground controversy came as Serb forces continued
attacks on ethnic Albanian villages, despite Milosevic's promises
that military operations would stop. Hundreds of people have been
killed since Feb. 28, when the Yugoslav leader sent police to crush
the rebels.
	   Of increasing concern to U.S. and other international leaders is
the growing number of ethnic Albanian refugees, estimated by the
U.N. refugee agency to be as high as 200,000. Many people are
living in woods or villages without food, water or medicine.
	   On Wednesday, the Serbian interior ministry used airplanes drop
leaflets urging people to go back to their homes and promising
safety to all. At least hundreds of homes in Kosovo have been
burned, however, and most ethnic Albanians are terrified of Serb
police.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who is trying to set up Kosovo
peace negotiations, visited Orahovac on Tuesday to see if it was
safe for ethnic Albanian refugees to return to the Serb-controlled
town.
	   Outside the town hall on Wednesday, about 20 men were waiting
when journalists arrived. All were refugees who had returned.
	   Cautiously, many said they felt safe.
	   ``Now it's better. The people are coming back home,'' said Camic
Isma, 50.
	   Other Albanians were less certain.
	   One man, standing in the courtyard of his house, gestured to
indicate the battle-wrecked town. ``Look at what they did. Serbs
did this. We are in danger, and we're very much afraid,'' said the
man, who refused to give his name for fear he would be jailed.

Colleagues honor medical ethicist for stand on circumcision
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) _ An international symposium is recognizing
one of Canada's top medical ethicists for her declaration that
circumcising baby boys is criminal assault.
	   Dr. Margaret Somerville of McGill University was scheduled to
receive a human rights award Wednesday at the fifth international
symposium on sexual mutilations at Oxford University. The award
recognizes her courage for stating last year that male circumcision
is as ethically wrong as female circumcision.
	   Somerville's stand prompted a variety of letters and calls to
her office at McGill University's Centre for Medicine, Ethics and
Law.
	   ``Either they love (her position), or they hate it,'' says her
assistant, Eileen Parle, who opens the mail. ``Some of the nastiest
ones weren't signed.''
	   However, support has come from surprising quarters, such as
young Jewish mothers reluctant to see their son's foreskins sliced
in a sacred rite among Jews. Circumcision of male babies on the
eighth day after birth is part of Abraham's covenant with God and
signifies formal admission into the faith.
	   Somerville opposes circumcision mainly because studies show it
is not medically necessary. In 1996, a special committee of the
Canadian Pediatric Society found the only benefit was a reduced
risk of urinary tract infection, which afflicts less than 2 percent
of males and can be treated with antibiotics. Some evidence also
suggests the procedure can reduce the risk of the rare penile
cancer.
	   Even so, about half of North American male babies undergo the
surgery. Bleeding and infection occur in 5 to 10 percent of cases,
and although in rare cases, some permanent damage can result.
	   Until recently, the debate over circumcision centred on whether
infants find it painful. Medical researchers have confirmed this.
They also found that if administered without painkillers,
circumcision can create a lasting pain reflex in infants.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Combat raged in nearly a third of
Colombia's 32 provinces Wednesday, continuing a three-day leftist
rebel offensive that authorities said has killed about 125 people.
	   The attacks by Colombia's two largest rebel groups _ the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, and the National
Liberation Army, or ELN _ began late Monday.
	   The guerrillas set off bombs in cities and towns and hit police
and army units with rockets, grenades mortars and machine-gun fire.
	   The U.S. government and Colombian military leaders have
condemned the rebels, saying they are violating pledges to seek
peace with incoming president Andres Pastrana, who takes office
Friday.
	   ``We look forward to the day when the guerrillas' deeds match
their pledges of peace,'' said a U.S. State Department comment
issued by the U.S. embassy spokesman in Bogota.

	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Police fired rubber bullets and used
water cannons Wednesday to drive away several hundred protesters
outside Lesotho's Parliament.
	   Opposition supporters pelted police with stones as they
prevented the demonstrators from entering Parliament.
	   The demonstration trapped Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili,
cabinet ministers and members of Parliament inside the building
until the crowd dispersed.
	   The demonstration reflected dissatisfaction with May's
re-election of the Lesotho Congress for Democracy to the
government.
	   The main opposition group, the Basotho National Party, won all
parliamentary seats in the 1993 election. It ruled until last year,
when former Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle broke away and formed the
LCD, taking most members of Parliament with him. Opposition members
have tried to block the move.
	   On Tuesday, thousands of opposition supporters thronged the road
leading to the royal palace and gave a petition to King Letsie III.

	   ITZHAR, West Bank (AP) _ Right-wing Jewish settlers and their
supporters on Wednesday demanded a formal suspension of peace talks
with the Palestinians, hours after two Israelis were ambushed and
killed at their isolated West Bank settlement.
	   Attackers repeatedly shot the two at close range and riddled
their white four-wheel-drive vehicle with bullets, the Israeli
military said. The shootings occurred around midnight as the pair
patrolled the boundaries of the settlement of Itzhar, on a remote,
rocky hilltop outside the Palestinian-controlled city of Nablus.
	   The slain men, aged 18 and 24, were both sons of prominent
right-wing rabbis, and both were students at a Jewish seminary in
Nablus that has been a focal point of past confrontations between
Palestinians and Jewish settlers.
	   Even before the slayings, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had
been under heavy pressure from the right wing and the powerful
settler lobby to not cede more West Bank land to the Palestinians.
With the killings, that pressure intensified.
	   Several right-wing lawmakers called for parliament to return
from its summer recess and consider steps to stop the already
foundering negotiations with the Palestinians.
	   ``We will build this land, we will keep this land, and we won't
give it over to murderers,'' said lawmaker Shaul Yaalom, whose
right-wing party has threatened to break with Netanyahu's ruling
coalition over the pullback issue.
	   Netanyahu said he viewed the attack ``very gravely'' and added
that it underscored the seriousness of Israel's security concerns.
	   Yasser Arafat, addressing Palestinian lawmakers Wednesday in the
West Bank town of Ramallah, did not mention the killings, instead
focusing on the deadlocked peace talks.
	   ``The Israeli government bears total responsibility for the
total freeze in the peace process, and the total chaos that will
engulf the entire region if the peace process is destroyed,'' he
said.
	   Israeli-Palestinian negotiations have been stalled for months
over a U.S. proposal for Israel to withdraw from an additional 13
percent of the West Bank. The two sides held two weeks of
high-level talks in an effort to restart the negotiations, but
reached no accord.
	   Israel TV reported that more talks might be held Thursday.
	   Settler leaders say Netanyahu's latest troop-pullback offer _
rejected Tuesday by Arafat as giving the Palestinians too little
land _ instead concedes too much territory, leaving settlements
like this one vulnerable to attack.
	   ``This is a tragic example of what is likely to occur tenfold
when troop redeployments are carried out,'' said settler leader
Ahron Dombe.
	   At an emotional memorial service in Jerusalem for the slain
settlers, some right-wing mourners interrupted a rabbi's prayer
with raucous catcalls. ``Why don't you talk about revenge?'' one
yelled.
	   ``An eye for an eye!'' said mourner Yaffa Cohen, red-faced from
anger and the stifling heat. Afterward, thousands joined in a
funeral procession back to Itzhar for the burials, breaking ground
for the settlement's first graves.
	   Israeli officials said they believed the assailants had fled
into adjacent Palestinian-run areas. Israel TV reported that
Palestinian police in Nablus arrested several individuals suspected
of involvement in the killings.

King gets OK from New Jersey casinos

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey (AP) _ Don King is back in business in
New Jersey, with regulators lifting a ban Wednesday that had
prevented the boxing promoter from working with casinos in the
state.
	   The Casino Control Commission voted 4-0 to vacate its 1994 order
barring King or his company, Don King Productions Inc., from doing
business with the gambling halls. King wasn't present for the vote.
	   The ban was initiated in 1994 after King was indicted on charges
that he bilked insurer Lloyd's of London for training expenses
involving a 1991 Julio Cesar Chavez fight that was eventually
canceled.
	   A year later, the casino commission voted unanimously to block
King from staging a Mike Tyson-Buster Mathis Jr. heavyweight fight
in Atlantic City. The bout was moved to Philadelphia.
	   Last month, a jury acquitted King of all nine wire fraud charges
but could not reach a verdict on charges against Don King
Productions Inc. Prosecutors do not plan to retry the company.
	   Given that outcome, there was no reason to keep the ban in
place, Deputy Attorney General Rick McDonough told casino
commissioners Wednesday.
	   Though the ban was lifted, the commission told King lawyer
Phillip Mizzone Jr. that King can transact business with casinos
only after he files a casino service industry license application.
	   Once he does, regulators will investigate King to determine
whether he possesses the ``good character, honesty and integrity''
required under New Jersey casino law.
	   He has qualified for a license before despite killing a man who
was robbing a numbers house he ran in 1954 _ it was ruled
self-defense _ and fatally beating a man who owed him money in
1967, for which he served four years in prison.
	   King could not be reached for comment Wednesday. There was no
answer at Don King Productions in New York, and a request for an
interview _ relayed through Mizzone _ was denied.
	   King, who now promotes WBA heavyweight champion Evander
Holyfield, hopes to stage a Holyfield fight in Atlantic City by
year's end, Mizzone said. No opponent has been signed, he said.
	   ``We're happy to have the suspension lifted and to resume doing
business in Atlantic City,'' Mizzone said.
	   This is the second time in two weeks New Jersey authorities have
been asked to rule on a prominent boxing figure. Last week, Tyson
sought to regain his boxing license in an appearance before the
state's Athletic Control Board.
	   Tyson was banned from boxing last year after biting Holyfield's
ears during a title fight at Las Vegas. The ban, issued by Nevada
regulators, allowed Tyson to apply for a license after one year. He
chose to do so in New Jersey.

	   ITZHAR, West Bank (AP) _ Right-wing Jewish settlers and their
supporters demanded Wednesday a formal suspension of peace talks
with the Palestinians, hours after two Israelis were ambushed and
killed at their isolated West Bank settlement.
	   Attackers repeatedly shot the two at close range and riddled
their white four-wheel-drive vehicle with bullets, the Israeli
military said. The shootings occurred around midnight as the pair
patrolled the boundaries of the settlement of Itzhar, on a remote,
rocky hilltop outside the Palestinian-controlled city of Nablus.
	   The slain men, Harel Binoun, 18, and Shlomo Livman, 24, were
both sons of prominent right-wing rabbis, and they both were
students at a Jewish seminary in Nablus that has been a focal point
of past confrontations between Palestinians and Jewish settlers.
	   Even before the slayings, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had
been under heavy pressure from the right wing and the powerful
settler lobby to not cede more West Bank land to the Palestinians.
With the killings, that pressure intensified.
	   Several right-wing lawmakers called for parliament to return
from its summer recess and consider steps to stop the already
foundering negotiations with the Palestinians.
	   ``We will build this land, we will keep this land, and we won't
give it over to murderers,'' said lawmaker Shaul Yaalom, whose
National Religious Party has threatened to break with Netanyahu's
ruling coalition over the pullback issue.
	   Netanyahu said he viewed the attack ``very gravely'' and added
that it underscored the seriousness of Israel's security concerns.
	   Yasser Arafat, addressing Palestinian lawmakers Wednesday in the
West Bank town of Ramallah, did not mention the killings, instead
focusing on the deadlocked peace talks.
	   ``The Israeli government bears total responsibility for the
total freeze in the peace process, and the total chaos that will
engulf the entire region if the peace process is destroyed,'' he
said.
	   Israeli-Palestinian negotiations have been stalled for months
over a U.S. proposal for Israel to withdraw from an additional 13
percent of the West Bank. The two sides held two weeks of
high-level talks in an effort to restart the negotiations, but
reached no accord.
	   Israel TV reported that more talks might be held Thursday.
	   Settler leaders say Netanyahu's latest troop-pullback offer _
rejected Tuesday by Arafat as giving the Palestinians too little
land _ instead concedes too much territory, leaving settlements
like this one vulnerable to attack.
	   ``This is a tragic example of what is likely to occur tenfold
when troop redeployments are carried out,'' said settler leader
Ahron Dombe.
	   At an emotional memorial service in Jerusalem for the slain
settlers, some right-wing mourners interrupted a rabbi's prayer
with raucous catcalls. ``Why don't you talk about revenge?'' one
yelled.
	   ``An eye for an eye!'' said mourner Yaffa Cohen, red-faced from
anger and the stifling heat. Afterward, thousands joined in a
funeral procession back to Itzhar for the burials, breaking ground
for the settlement's first graves.
	   Israeli officials said they believed the assailants had fled
into adjacent Palestinian-run areas. Israel TV reported that
Palestinian police in Nablus arrested several individuals suspected
of involvement in the killings.

Three indicted in arms contraband to Croatia during war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ A military court on Wednesday indicted a
retired air force captain and two civilians for selling arms to
Croatia during the war in the former Yugoslavia in 1991.
	   The three were indicted on charges of forging documents to allow
the shipment of 11 tons of rockets, grenade launchers and automatic
rifles for dlrs 200,000.
	   The Court's ruling reopened the case, which had been closed by a
military judge.
	   The arms were exported with documents from the army's arms
factory and labeled as medical supplies and other humanitarian aid
bound for Sri Lanka. Instead, the shipment was intended for
Croatian forces, but was discovered and intercepted by Hungarian
authorities at the Budapest airport.
	   Indicted by the Santiago Military Court were retired air force
captain Patricio Perez; Ramon Perez, a civilian army employee, and
Antonio Sahed, manager of a private exports company.
	   The Court confirmed the acquittal of seven other people,
including a retired air force general.

U.N. weapons chief softens tone, says `creative' solutions needed

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Butler comments after meeting with
Annan. &QL; 
 &UR; With Iraq &QL; 
 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Speaking in softer tones after a long talk
with his boss, chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler said
Wednesday that ``creative'' solutions were needed to break a
``syndrome behavior'' in arms inspections in Iraq.
	   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein froze cooperation Wednesday with
U.N. weapons inspectors to protest eight years of economic
sanctions. Saddam's freeze followed after Iraq's 250-member
National Assembly voted unanimously earlier Wednesday to cut off
cooperation.
	   Butler, who looked chastened after meeting with
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to discuss Iraq's decision, appeared
to back down from his earlier insistence that access to weapons
information was the only way to break the impasse.
	   He said disarmament remained a priority, but that ``the whole
questions of sanctions is very worrying.''
	   ``The Secretary-General and I agree there's a syndrome of
behavior going on here ... maybe we have to be a bit more creative
than in the past.''
	   Butler usually confines himself to the technicalities of weapons
and their disarmament, and his venture into diplomatic niceties was
rare _ indeed, he stressed that any ``creative'' solutions would be
up to the Security Council.
	   His softer tone suggested that efforts by Iraq and its friends
on the Security Council to wear down the inspectors were working.
	   Annan, who in February brokered the Memorandum of Understanding
that averted war over the inspections, has much political capital
invested in making sure there is progress.
	   Earlier, Yuriy Fedotov, Russia's No. 2 representative to the
United Nations, placed much of the blame for the breakdown on
Butler, saying it was his decision to break off the dialogue this
week, and that he ignored real progress on the part of the Iraqis.
	   Butler had responded angrily to those claims, claiming that the
blame for the breakdown lay squarely with Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz.
	   ``Tariq Aziz demanded of me that I wave a magic wand over their
weapons program and say they're finished, shazam, the wand,
finished,'' he said. ``And I said I can't do that, I need
evidence.''
	   Butler said he will present a written report to the Security
Council on Thursday.
	   ``What is at issue here here is the decisions of the Security
Council, which are binding in international law,'' he said earlier.
``Whether or not Iraq is prepared to accept that law is what is at
issue.''
	   The international sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in
1990, sparking the Gulf War, cannot be lifted until the U.N.
inspectors certify Iraq has destroyed all its chemical and
biological weapons and long-range missiles. The sanctions ban Iraq
from freely exporting its most valuable commodity _ oil.
	   Butler said he found Aziz's stance puzzling because the
commission is close to saying Iraq has no weapons of mass
destruction in some areas.
	   ``In the missile area, we're very close. In the chemical weapons
area, we're very close. We're not close in the biological weapons
area. And that's what was most puzzling to me _ that he should
insist on this ... claim that everything is done, because he knows
very well that that's far from true in the biological area,''
Butler said.
	   He said Aziz continued to refuse to hand over a document found
last month by U.N. weapons inspectors, detailing types of bombs and
rockets that Iraq has said were used to deliver chemical and
biological agents.
	   ``Tariq Aziz refused to give it to me and said 'you will never
get it.'''

Court president: U.N. tribunal for Rwanda's genocide looking

 &UR; By SUSAN SEVAREID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Things are looking up for the U.N.
tribunal for Rwanda's genocide, the court president said Wednesday,
defending a body much maligned for its plodding pace in dispensing
justice.
	   The tribunal, based in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha,
has 35 suspects in custody but has won just one conviction in
nearly four years.
	   That should change soon, Judge Laity Kama told reporters
Wednesday through a U.N. translator, saying some things already
have improved considerably.
	   ``For some time, we did not have modern means of communication,
the Internet. (And) we were forced to use the local telephone
lines,'' Kama said. Court officials now can send computer mail and
_ as of a week ago _ have Internet access.
	   The court also was setting up a third trial chamber.
	   ``Now, it is a question of setting it up _ that new hall,
providing it with equipment, increasing the number of legal
asstants. ...Much has been done, much remains to be done.''
	   The court announced new procedures in June to speed up trials,
including pre-trial discussion between the prosecution and the
defense to decide which issues are uncontested and giving judges
more power to control questioning and cross-examination.
	   ``We think now that we can conclude a trial in four to six
months rather than the situation in the past where it would last
more than a year,'' Kama said.
	   The tribunal was established in November 1994 to deal with
alleged architects of the slaughter earlier that year. Only one
person has been convicted, former Rwandan Prime Minister Jean
Kambanda, who pleaded guilty to genocide and crimes against
humanity.
	   At last a half-million Rwandans, mainly minority Tutsis, died in
Rwanda's government-orchestrated genocide.

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Forces opposed to the ruling Taliban
religious militia claimed a victory Wednesday in fighting in
eastern Afghanistan, while the two front lines just outside the
northern opposition stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif were reported calm
Wednesday.
	   Abdullah, a spokesman for anti-Taliban alliance leader Ahmed
Shah Masood, said Masood's troops captured 25 Taliban bunkers after
a successful offensive about 200 kilometers (about 120 miles) east
of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   But Taliban spokesman Abdul Hay Muttayn said his forces repelled
the attack.
	   ``The opposition wants to keep the Taliban busy in different
parts of Afghanistan,'' said Muttayn, who had no details on the
fighting.
	   Fifty Taliban soldiers were killed and 112 captured in
Wednesday's eastern fighting, Abdullah said, making no mention of
alliance casualties.
	   The alliance is backed into a small corner of northern
Afghanistan. With Mazar-e-Sharif in sight, the Taliban appear
poised to capture all of the country.
	   Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council called Wednesday for peace
talks between the two warring factions.
	   ``The Security Council is deeply concerned at the dangerous
escalation of the armed conflict, and it stresses the need to end
the bloodshed,'' the president of the Security Council, Slovenian
Ambassador Danilo Turk, said after the council was briefed
privately on the latest fighting.
	   Turk said council members had expressed ``grave concern'' about
the deterioration of the humanitarian situation and deplored the
Taliban's expulsion of several international aid agencies from the
capital, Kabul.

Butler, saying it was his decision to break off the dialogue this
week and that he ignored real progress on the part of the Iraqis.
	   Butler had responded angrily to those claims, claiming that the
blame for the breakdown lay squarely with Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz.
	   ``Tariq Aziz demanded of me that I wave a magic wand over their
weapons program and say they're finished, shazam, the wand,
finished,'' he said. ``And I said I can't do that, I need
evidence.''
	   Butler said he will present a written report to the Security
Council on Thursday. Annan's office announced Wednesday evening
that the secretary-general had postponed a trip to Portugal because
he felt it would be ``useful'' for him to participate in Thursday's
meeting.
	   The international sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in
1990, sparking the Gulf War, cannot be lifted until the U.N.
inspectors certify Iraq has destroyed all its chemical and
biological weapons and long-range missiles. The sanctions ban Iraq
from freely exporting its most valuable commodity _ oil.
	   Butler said he found Aziz's stance puzzling because the
commission is close to saying Iraq has no weapons of mass
destruction in some areas.
	   ``In the missile area, we're very close. In the chemical weapons
area, we're very close. We're not close in the biological weapons
area. And that's what was most puzzling to me _ that he should
insist on this ... claim that everything is done, because he knows
very well that that's far from true in the biological area,''
Butler said.
	   In a 38-page letter from Aziz to the Security Council, the Iraqi
deputy prime minister reiterated the Iraqi position and described
in detail Iraq's point of view on areas of disagreement with the
inspectors.
	   On missiles, aziz accused the inspectors of raising trivial
matters and asking questions unrelated to the essence of the work.
On chemical weapons, aziz said the special commission closed the
file in 1995 but Butler raised a secondary issue, the fate of a
number of 155 mm shells, demanding more investigation.
	   Aziz repeated Iraq's denial of U.S. claims that there was
evidence of the deadly VX nerve gas on missile heads, explaining
that ``there could be some other reasons to what has been said of
finding of decomposed chemical traces in the destroyed missile
heads that might be among the VX elements.''
	   ``The reason might be some decomposed chemical material that
gave certain indications or that might be a result of using
equipment previously used in producing the VX to fill up missile
heads with another material.''
	   Butler said Aziz continued to refuse to hand over a document
found last month by U.N. weapons inspectors, detailing types of
bombs and rockets that Iraq has said were used to deliver chemical
and biological agents.
	   ``Tariq Aziz refused to give it to me and said 'you will never
get it.'''

Sasaki sets record of 194 saves as BayStars beat Tigers

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Kazuhiro Sasaki set a Japanese professional
baseball record with the 194th save of his career Wednesday as the
Central League's front-running Yokohama BayStars beat the Hanshin
Tigers 4-2 at Yokohama.
	   Sasaki, a 30-year-old right-handed reliever, held the Tigers to
one hit, two walks and no runs in the ninth inning. It was his 29th
save of the season.
	   The previous career record of 193 was set in 1984 by Yutaka
Enatsu of the Seibu Lions. Sasaki and Korean Sun Dong-yol of the
Chunichi Dragons tied last year for the old single season record of
38.
	   The BayStars are three games ahead of the second-place Chunichi
Dragons, who downed the Yakult Swallows 2-1 on Kazuki Inoue's home
run in the bottom of the 12th inning at Nagoya Dome. Inoue has
eight homers.
	   The Dragons led 1-0 on former Chicago Cubs player Leo Gomez's
one-run single in the first inning, but the Swallows tied it 1-1 in
the top of the ninth on Hatsuhiko Tsuji's RBI single.
	   At Tokyo Dome, pinch hitter Kojiro Machida doubled home two runs
with two outs in the top of 13th inning, giving the Hiroshima Toyo
Carp a 9-7 victory over the Yomiuri Giants.
	   The Giants had tied the game 7-7 on Toshihisa Nishi's three-run
home run in the bottom of the five-run ninth inning. Nishi has four
homers.
	   In the Pacific League, Jerry Brooks singled home a run and
Katsuhiro Nishiura drove in two as the front-running Nippon Ham
Fighters beat the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks 3-1 at Fukuoka Dome.
	   In the sixth inning, Nishiura drove in the tying run with a
sacrifice fly and Brooks, formerly with the Florida Marlins,
singled home the winner following a single by former Cleveland
Indians player Nigel Wilson.
	   The Fighters are 6 1/2 games ahead of the second-place Kintetsu
Buffaloes, who beat the Seibu Lions 3-2 in 12 innings.
	   Buffaloes pinch hitter Kazunori Yamamoto doubled home the
winning run in the bottom of the 12th.
	   At Chiba, Kiyoshi Hatsushiba singled home runs in the first and
third innings as the Chiba Lotte Marines edged the Orix BlueWave
2-1 in a game called with one out in the bottom of the fifth
because of torrential rains.

Peru's rebel leaders face different lives in prison

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ The leaders of Peru's two guerrilla groups
serve life sentences in the same prison, but their treatment is far
from equal, Prime Minister Javier Valle Riestra said Wednesday.
	   Guzman, founder of the Maoist Shining Path, and Victor Polay,
head of the pro-Castro Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, were
both captured by police in 1992, and both serve life sentences in a
naval prison in Lima's port city of Callao.
	   But there the similarity ends.
	   Guzman enjoys special privileges such as music and company,
while Polay lives in isolation with no privileges, Valle Riestra
said during a meeting with foreign reporters.
	   ``Abimael Guzman is with his woman listening to Wagner and
Bach,'' Valle Riestra said. ``If I were a prisoner, I would like to
live like him.''
	   Guzman and his lover and fellow rebel Elena Iparraguirre occupy
neighboring cells. Valle Riestra's comments suggest the two are
allowed to visit each other.
	   It had previously been thought Guzman lived in complete
isolation.
	   Valle Riestra's comments came as a surprise, since little is
known about prison conditions in the ultra-secret naval prison.
	   ``Polay's conditions, however, are unjust because he is allowed
only half an hour outside his cell a day,'' said Valle Riestra, who
was named to his post by Fujimori on June 4.
	   Valle Riestra did not say why the two received different
treatment.
	   But following secret conversations with Guzman, the government
in 1993 released a statement by Guzman in which he proposed peace
talks with the government and called on supporters to lay down
their arms.
	   Polay's rebel comrades in December 1996 took hundreds of
hostages at a diplomatic cocktail party in the Japanese
ambassador's residence in a failed attempt to free him and other
imprisoned rebels.
	   The hostage takers denounced prison conditions calling them
``tombs.''
	   Human rights groups say that prison guards don't speak to
prisoners. Cells are 6 1/2-feet-square (2 meters square). Food is
passed under the door.
	   Officials with President Alberto Fujimori's government rejected
Valle Riestra's comments.
	   ``I know of no special treatment among terrorist prisoners,''
said Congressman Anselmo Revilla of Fujimori's governing coalition.
	   Peru's war against leftist rebels has left 30,000 dead since
1980, but the number of Shining Path attacks has fallen sharply
since Guzman's capture.
	   The larger and bloodier Shining Path continues to operate in
remote parts of Peru's northern jungle and central highlands.
	   The smaller Tupac Amaru rebels appear to have largely
disappeared following the failure of the spectacular
four-month-long hostage taking.

	   BEVERLY HILLS, California (AP) _ Steve Sampson, who coached the
United States to a last-place finish in the World Cup and then
quit, says his next job in soccer will be at the local level.
	   Sampson said Wednesday that he will become technical director of
the Las Virgenes Soccer Club in Westlake Village. The club's board
of directors has unanimously approved Sampson's hiring, but he has
yet to sign a contract.
	   Sampson is also seeking to be hired as director of the U.S.
Soccer Federation's Project 2010, whose aim is to have the
Americans win the World Cup within 12 years,
	   Sampson's affiliation with the Las Virgenes Club is an outgrowth
of his original idea of starting a youth team near his Agoura Hills
home. After discussion with Las Virgenes officials, he decided it
would be better to work with an existing club.
	   ``I contacted them about six months ago,'' Sampson said. ``This
was underway well in advance of the World Cup. If I stayed on as
U.S. coach, it would allow me a way to maintain my sharpness as a
coach during the week, because you get very little time to coach
with the national team.''
	   Sampson resigned as U.S. coach on June 29 after the Americans
went 0-3 in the World Cup, finishing last in the 32-nation field.
	   On Wednesday, Sampson joined Iran coach Jalal Talebi at a news
conference, and USSF and Major League Soccer spokesmen said future
games against Iran were likely. Iran upset the United States 2-1 at
the tournament in France.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Combat raged in nearly a third of
Colombia's 32 provinces Wednesday, continuing a three-day leftist
rebel offensive that authorities said has killed about 125 people.
	   The attacks by Colombia's two largest rebel groups _ the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, and the National
Liberation Army, or ELN _ began late Monday.
	   The guerrillas set off bombs in cities and towns and hit police
and army units with rockets, grenades mortars and machine-gun fire.
	   A truck bomb packed with 220 pounds (100 kilos) of explosives
was deactivated without incident in front of an army training
school in the capital, Bogota, the army reported Wednesday.

Duffer targets 43 golf courses in one day

<TEXT>
	   RENO, Nevada (AP) _ Don ``Snoshu'' Thompson hit 43 drives and
lost all 43 golf balls Wednesday, but he didn't take a mulligan and
he didn't seem to mind.
	   ``See you later men,'' he yelled to a dozen golfers on the first
tee at Brookside Municipal Golf Course after he drove the ball into
the left rough, turned on his heals and jogged back to his car.
	   Thompson, 68, didn't have time to look for his ball.
	   He was trying to make tee times at 43 golf courses in the
Reno-Lake Tahoe area in a 12-hour period in an effort to showcase
the region as an up-and-coming golfing destination.
	   ``I guess I'm part of this insanity,'' said his 37-year-old
daughter Randi, who was along for the ride. ``It's his shag bag _
driving range balls he's hitting.
	   ``My dad wouldn't leave a good ball behind. He's too
conservative.''
	   He father, a local golf and skiing writer who owns a tavern in
Reno, planned the event with city officials determined to bolster
their tourism base as legalized gambling spreads elsewhere.
	   ``In the last two or three years, there have probably been 10
new golf courses open,'' said Beverly Loranger, spokeswoman for the
Reno-Sparks Convention and Visitors Authority.
	   ``It has been kind of a quiet little secret people don't know
about,'' she said.
	   For his last stunt, ``Snoshu'' skied at 15 area resorts in the
same day.
	   ``The Guinness Book of World Records turned me down when I did
15 ski lifts in one day, but I'm going to try again,'' Thompson
said Wednesday before he teed off at Red Hawk Golf Course in
Spanish Springs, northeast of Reno, at 6:15 a.m.
	   The left-hander, literally running from idling car to tee and
back, booked a tight schedule that would take him up the Sierra
Nevada to Lake Tahoe and back to Reno for a final 5:55 p.m. tee
time.
	   He already was running a few minutes behind by the time he got
to Brookside Municipal Golf Course for his 6:30 a.m. slot. But he
raced off to nearby Rosewood Golf Course and shaved off a few
minutes despite heeding a request from a sprinting television
cameraman to re-enact his swing.
	   ``Hurry,'' Thompson told the photographer and ran back to his
car.
	   How fast were they driving?
	   ``Too fast,'' said Randi, a businesswoman running for the state
legislature.
	   ``We're not going to break any laws,'' the elder Thompson said
as they took off again.
	   Reno's location at the base of the Sierra Nevada and the edge of
the Great Basin accounts for wide variety of geography encountered
in the 43 courses Thompson targeted within one hour of the city of
143,000.
	   They ranged from the 6,000-foot (1,800-meter) mountain courses
along Lake Tahoe, to narrow links layouts in the swamps of Washoe
Valley to the southeast and the desert courses to the north and
east where temperatures neared a 102-degree Fahrenheit (39-degree
Celsius) record Wednesday.
	   ``Palm Springs has a lot of courses, but they are all desert
courses,'' Thompson said. ``You go to Myrtle Beach and there's tons
of courses, but it is all swamp courses.
	   ``Here, if it's cold we go play in the desert. If it's hot, we
go to the mountains.''

NBA labor talks to resume
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ For the first time in 45 days, National
Basketball Association owners and players will hold formal talks
aimed at ending the lockout. It remains to be seen if Thursday's
meeting will produce more posturing or some real progress.
	   ``Eventually you have to make a deal, and the only way you get
there is to keep talking,'' deputy commissioner Russ Granik said
Wednesday. ``I don't think either party has any specific
expectations, but we don't think it's a great idea to let months go
by without sitting down and talking.''
	   The bargaining session, to be held at a Manhattan law office,
will be the first formal talks since June 22 _ eight days before
the owners imposed the lockout.
	   Along with Granik, Hunter and commissioner David Stern, the
talks will be attended by about a dozen players and seven owners,
plus lawyers for both sides.
	   The sides remain far apart on economic issues, especially what
percentage of basketball-related income should be devoted toward
player salaries. The owners had the right to toss out the old labor
agreement if salaries rose above 52 percent, and that number jumped
to 57 percent last season.
	   ``However you want to describe being as far apart as possible,
that's where we are. I don't think we've found any common ground at
all,'' Granik said. ``I think the players keep hoping that the
problem will just go away. But the players are first going to have
to accept that we have some serious economic problems to deal with.
We have to keep working to convince them of that.''
	   Despite those harsh words and the rhetoric from both sides,
Granik said the owners aren't as married to the concept of ``cost
certainty'' as they earlier indicated.
	   ``Cost certainty'' has been one of Stern's mantras in his public
statements about the lockout.
	   '' `Certainty' is not the right word from our standpoint,
because we're ready to accept that things could operate within a
certain range,'' Granik said. ``But you've got to know what the
outer limit of that range is, because we always seem to hit it.''
	   Hunter, informed of Granik's statement, sounded hopeful.
	   ``My interpretation is that it indicates prudence is setting in,
that maybe owners might be serious about sitting down and trying to
work out some agreement,'' Hunter said. ``I'm anxious to see what
they'll be talking about tomorrow.''
	   Neither Granik nor Hunter would say who should feel compelled to
submit the next formal proposal. Owners have made four different
offers, while the players made only one back when talks began April
1.
	   ``I guess we'll find that out in our general discussion,''
Hunter said. ``Some way or another, either side will conclude
whether it is willing or whether it's in its best interest to
submit some new kind of proposal.
	   Owners have asked for a maximum salary of dlrs 9-10 million and
an eventual elimination of the Larry Bird exception _ the rule that
allows teams to exceed the salary cap to retain their own free
agents _ as well as a lengthening of the rookie salary scale.
	   Players have offered to slow the growth of the salary cap in
future years, but only if the amount of BRI devoted to player
salaries exceeded 63 percent.

	   ANAHEIM, California (AP) _ Manny Ramirez hit a two-run homer in
the ninth inning and the Cleveland Indians beat the Anaheim Angels
6-5 Wednesday to stop a five-game losing streak.
	   After Jim Thome's one-out double, Ramirez connected off Troy
Percival (2-5) for his 27th homer.
	   Paul Shuey (4-1) allowed one run and two hits in two innings.
After Mike Jackson allowed Anaheim to put runners on first and
third with two outs, Paul Assenmacher walked Jim Edmonds.
Assenmacher then got Dave Hollins to hit a game-ending popup for
his first save since last Sept. 19.
 &UR; Orioles 6, Tigers 1
	   In Baltimore, Juan Guzman (7-12) pitched seven innings of
four-hit ball in his Orioles debut and Rafael Palmeiro hit his
fifth career grand slam as Baltimore completed a two-game sweep and
finished the season series 10-1. The Orioles are 20-5 since the
All-Star break.
	   Palmeiro's 34th homer of the season, a two-out shot to center
off Sean Runyan, made it 6-1 in the eighth. All the runs were
unearned, courtesy of an error by shortstop Damion Easley.
	   Justin Thompson (9-9) lost for the first time in seven starts
since June 28, allowing two runs, four hits and a career-high six
walks in 5 2-3 innings.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Sammy Sosa hit his 43rd homer but the Arizona
Diamondbacks sent Kerry Wood to his first loss at Wrigley Field,
beating the Chicago Cubs 10-7 Wednesday.
	   Andy Fox and Tony Batista homered for Arizona, and Andy Benes
(9-11) struck out nine in six innings. Gregg Olson pitched the
ninth for his 20th save in 23 chances.
	   Sosa pulled the Cubs to 5-3 in the third with a two-run homer,
pulling within two of Mark McGwire, the major league leader. Sosa,
1-for-4 with three RBIs, has six homers in his last 11 games.
	   Wood (11-6), who may skip his next start to rest a ``dead arm,''
gave up seven runs and nine hits in six innings.
 &UR; Marlins 5, Astros 3
	   In Miami, Jesus Sanchez (5-6) pitched seven innings on a
92-degree afternoon, winning for only the second time in his past
14 starts, and Derrek Lee hit a three-run homer.
	   Matt Mantei completed the six-hitter by striking out the side in
the ninth for his sixth save.
	   Mike Hampton (9-6) allowed five runs _ four earned _ in five
innings. Houston second baseman Craig Biggio sat out the game,
ending his streak of 494 consecutive games, second only to Cal
Ripken among active players.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Wednesday
froze cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors to protest eight
years of economic sanctions against his country. Saddam's move came
hours after Iraq's 250-member National Assembly voted unanimously
to cut off cooperation and called for an end to sanctions.
Legislators voted after a new dispute with the weapons inspectors
charged with determining whether Iraq has eliminated its weapons of
mass destruction. In New York, chief U.N. weapons inspector said
``creative solutions'' were needed to resolve the impasse. Butler,
who looked chastened after meeting with Secretary-General Kofi
Annan to discuss Iraq's decision, appeared to back down from his
earlier insistence that access to weapons information was the only
way to break the impasse. (IRAQ)
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Rebels reportedly captured two cities and
advanced on others in troubled eastern Congo Wednesday in what
President Laurent Kabila's government called a rebellion supported
by troops from one-time ally Rwanda. ``Almost 400 army soldiers
have come from Rwanda and have caused Congolese bloodshed,''
Congolese government spokesman Didier Mumengi said Wednesday. A
leader of the mutineers, however, went on a rebel-held radio
station in the eastern town of Goma near Rwanda's border and denied
the uprising was anything but home-grown. ``This is a struggle of
the Congolese people,'' said Arthur Z'Ahidi Ngoma. (CONGO)
	   ITZHAR, West Bank (AP) _ Right-wing Jewish settlers and their
supporters demanded Wednesday a formal suspension of peace talks
with the Palestinians, hours after two Israelis were ambushed and
killed at their isolated West Bank settlement. Attackers repeatedly
shot the two at close range and riddled their white
four-wheel-drive vehicle with bullets, the Israeli military said.
The shootings occurred around midnight as the pair patrolled the
boundaries of the settlement of Itzhar, on a remote, rocky hilltop
outside the Palestinian-controlled city of Nablus. The slain men,
Harel Binoun, 18, and Shlomo Livman, 24, were both sons of
prominent right-wing rabbis, and they both were students at a
Jewish seminary in Nablus that has been a focal point of past
confrontations between Palestinians and Jewish settlers.
(ISRAEL-SHOOTING)
	   ORAHOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The graves are fresh mounds of dirt
and garbage, the names of the dead, if known, marked on crude
wooden stakes. Serb police said Wednesday this is where they buried
ethnic Albanians, infuriating local leaders who called the site a
garbage dump. The crude burial ground holds victims of last month's
fighting in Orahovac, one of the ugliest battles in five months of
war in Kosovo province. Police claimed 40 bodies are here, hoping
to disprove reports of Serbs burying ethnic Albanians in multiple
or mass graves. What happened in Orahovac has been controversial
from the start, with ethnic Albanians claiming hundreds of
civilians were massacred and Serb forces denying it. For days, Serb
forces have been attacking and burning ethnic Albanian villages.
Allegations of mass graves heightened fears that Serb forces, in
their campaign to crush ethnic Albanian rebels, are trying to
``ethnically cleanse'' Kosovo of its Albanian population.
(YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   WUHAN, China (AP) _ Bursting through the collapsing levee, a
foaming wall of water crashed into Ma Xiagu's farm and swept away
family and friends. While her house quickly flooded to its eaves,
soldiers and residents who had been guarding the dike kept above
water by clinging desperately to poplar trees. Other soldiers in
boats moved in to pluck survivors from the muddy waters while
helicopters dropped life jackets. ``The waters came and my house
collapsed, just like that. I had to leave because there was no way
to stay alive there,'' said Ma, her heavily lined face showing
complete exhaustion. At least 1,288 people have been killed during
this year's unusually long season of summer flooding. But
Saturday's collapse of levees along the Yangtze River in Jiayu,
about 70 kilometers (45 miles) upriver from Wuhan, represented
disaster workers' worst nightmare. (CHINA-FLOODS)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks rebounded modestly late Wednesday
afternoon from Tuesday's plunge after a bumpy ride that took the
Dow Jones industrials down by as much as 125 points in the final
hour of trading. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 59.47 _ or
0.7 percent _ at 8,546.78 in a choppy day that suggests investors
are still shaken by Tuesday's 300-point drop and the Dow's nearly
10 percent retreat in just 12 sessions since it closed at a record.
(US-CLOSING STOCKS, US-STOCK MARKET)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Wall Street's big drop rattled investor sentiment
around the world, sending share prices lower Wednesday from Asia to
Europe before the New York Stock Exchange reopened. Blue chips on
Europe's biggest markets lost about 2 percent of their value,
although many shares managed to finish above the lows they hit
during a hectic trading day. In London, the Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100-share index closed with a loss of 103.6 points, or 1.8
percent, at 5,632.5. Earlier, the so-called ``footsie'' had been
down by almost 2.9 percent on Europe's biggest market. Frankfurt's
DAX index finished its afternoon elecronic trading session with a
loss of 1.8 percent, similar to the losses by the CAC 40 in Paris.
(WORLD MARKETS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Asian economic crisis is taking a toll on
American manufacturers and farmers, but strong consumer demand is
helping to keep the overall economy steaming ahead, the Federal
Reserve said Wednesday. The Fed found widespread evidence that
Asia's troubles were cutting into demand for American manufactured
goods and depressing the prices of many farm commodities. But even
with these adverse effects, the 12 Fed districts ``generally
indicate a high level of economic activity,'' the central bank said
in its latest snapshot of economic conditions around the country.
The report is used by Fed policy-makers to determine whether to
change interest rates. (US-FED-ECONOMY)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ An independent economic institute on
Wednesday threw cold water on Chancellor Helmut Kohl's optimistic
forecast that unemployment will dip below the psychologically
significant 4 million mark this fall. The Munich-based German
Institute for Economic Research said the number of jobless will
remain around 4.3 million, or 11.2 percent, through 1998, and isn't
expected to decline to 4 million until the end of 1999. Germany's
double-digit unemployment has been a key issue in fall elections,
and Kohl has been counting on improvements in the sluggish German
economy to propel him to a record fifth term. Kohl had predicted
Tuesday that unemployment would fall to 4 million this year and
drop below that level in 1999. (GERMANY-UNEMPLOYMENT)
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's central bank will guarantee
foreign investment in troubled banks and finance companies, the
Bank of Thailand's deputy governor said Wednesday. Kitti
Patpongpibul told reporters that foreign investors will have the
option of selling their stake to the central bank's rescue fund
after a period of five years. The enticement is aimed at
encouraging foreigners to help rescue the financial system,
burdened with bad loans that helped cause the Asian economic
crisis. The government is demanding that banks and finance
companies raise their registered capital and implement tougher
rules on non-performing loans. (THAILAND-BANK INVESTMENTS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Improved tax collections in July show that Russia
is making progress in getting its budget in order under an
austerity program, Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said in an
interview published Wednesday. Also, the government has not had to
spend any of the dlrs 4.8 billion it recently received from the
International Monetary Fund, using the money instead to bolster the
Central Bank's reserves, Kiriyenko told the Moskovsky Komsomolets
newspaper. The loan, part of a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package to
be released gradually as Russia cleans up its finances, helped
avoid a devaluation of the national currency, the ruble, he said.
Russia's tax collection figures are up, but receipts in August will
be lower than expected. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   TRAVERSE CITY, Michigan (AP) _ The proposed merger of Chrysler
Corp. and Daimler-Benz AG is progressing more smoothly than
expected despite initial worries about melding two different
corporate cultures, Chrysler's president said Wednesday. With the
major regulatory approvals recently received from the United States
and the European Union, Chrysler and Daimler-Benz shareholders are
scheduled to vote on the proposed merger Sept. 18. Chrysler said it
would release a special proxy statement on Thursday. The merger
remains on track to be completed in November or early December,
Chrysler President Thomas T. Stallkamp said. (US-DAIMLER-CHRYSLER)

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Prince Charles and his two sons are
vacationing on Greek waters nearly one year after the late Princess
Diana cruised the same area.
	   Charles and Princes William and Harry arrived in Greece late
Tuesday as guests of two billionaire ship owners. The royal
visitors are expected to stay on Yiannis Latsis' 122-meter
(402-foot) yacht Alexander and then embark on a cruise on one of
Panaghiotis Lemos' yachts.
	   Last August, Diana and her friend Rosa Monckton spent six days
cruising the Saronic Gulf south of Athens and visiting several
islands. Diana, her millionaire beau Dodi Fayed and their chauffeur
were killed Aug. 31, 1997, in a car crash in Paris.
	   The vacation plans for Charles and his sons were not disclosed.
	   Their hosts are known for protecting the privacy of their
high-profile guests.
	   In July, former U.S. President George Bush and retired U.S. Gen.
Colin Powell and their families arrived in Greece to cruise aboard
Latsis' yacht.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Months after his wife's death, Paul McCartney is
promising to keep the ``torch burning'' by continuing her animal
rights crusade.
	   In an interview with Animal Times, run by the group People for
the Ethical Treatment of Animals, McCartney said he wants to prove
he is as committed to animal rights as his wife was.
	   ``Animal rights is too good an idea for the next century to be
suppressed,'' he said. ``I think it's time we got nice.''
	   McCartney said he is still grieving his wife, who died of cancer
in April, but added, ``We have to look at the blessings and replace
all the bad memories with good ones.''
	   McCartney, who has remained out of the spotlight since his
wife's death, also granted an interview to British-based Viva Life,
which is run by Vegetarians International Voice for Animals, a
group Mrs. McCartney helped start. Both interviews will be
published next month.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Arguing that a fashion show is not a
cultural event, archeologists snubbed Calvin Klein's request to
stage shows at two of the city's most treasured ancient sites.
	   ``Only artistic shows are allowed at the sites, and a fashion
show is not an artistic show,'' Mary Pandou, director of the
archeological sites for the Central Archeological Committee said
Wednesday.
	   Klein had applied to stage shows at two 2nd century sites: the
Roman Agora, or marketplace, and at the Herodion theater,
constructed in honor of the Roman Emperor Herod's wife Regilla.
	   ``We are looking at the possibility of staging a CK Calvin Klein
Jeans event in Greece,'' said Robert Triefus, a New York spokesman
for Klein.
	   According to Pandou, archeologists feared a fashion show could
damage prized antiquities at the Roman Agora, which has never in
the past been used for any kind of show.
	   ``You can't put a runway in the Agora,'' Pandou said.
	   Although the theater is used to stage plays, musicals and
theatrical events, archeologists said Klein's bid was not musically
or theatrically oriented. Only those types of shows are allowed at
the Herodion, they said.
	   Klein's show will still take place, even if it is not held in
the ancient sites. Triefus said staging an event is part of the
company's marketing plan.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Michael DeBakey credits some of his
success in inventing heart devices to his mother's sewing.
	   ``I read several books on engineering and with the help of the
Dacron which my mother used for sewing, I managed to create the
tubes'' for heart pumps, the 91-year-old DeBakey said.
	   DeBakey, a Lebanese-American pioneer in artificial heart
research, made his comments to the London-based Arabic newspaper
Al-Hayat.
	   A professor and researcher at Baylor University in Houston,
DeBakey was the first surgeon to implant a partial artificial heart
in a patient nearly 40 years ago. He also is among the developers
of a new generation of smaller, more reliable heart pumps.

For USA's Greene, great start makes winning finish
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL;

 &UR; By ED McCULLOUGH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ It was a great start. Close to perfect.
And Maurice Greene needed every bit of it.
	   ``That's probably the best start I ever had in my entire life,''
a jubilant Greene said moments after winning the 100-meter event in
9.90 seconds Wednesday at the DN Galan Grand Prix. ``That's what
made me win the race today.''
	   The muscular American burst from the blocks at the crack of the
starter's pistol. He was the first to raise his head, get his arms
pumping and hit top stride. It was the fifth best time of the year.
	   Just a step behind the whole way, on his left in lane three, was
Ato Boldon, his training partner who posted the best times of the
year and ran a faster qualifying heat (9.89).
	   ``The thing is, he (Greene) got one of those starts you can't do
anything about,'' said the Trinidadian, who finished second in 9.96
seconds. ``I spent the whole race trying to catch him.... The
difference in the margin at the finish was the margin he had at the
start.''
	   Four stadium marks fell at the storied 1912 Olympic arena that's
been the stage for 83 world records, the most anywhere. That meant
one-carat diamonds valued at 10,000 dollars each for Greene and
three others.
	   But there were no world records this time, probably due to the
cool, damp weather. A 25-minute rain shower ended shortly after the
opening ceremony. That took an edge off some performances.
	   ``It's cold tonight and I just thought: Don't get injured,''
said Steve Backley of Great Britain, winner of the javelin event
with a throw of 85.79 meters, well below the world mark (98.48).
``So I didn't really go for it.''
	   Zahra Ouaziz of Morocco, winner of the women's 5,000-meter event
in 14:40.19, sped past the ``rabbit'' at about the halfway point
and led easily the rest of the way, never far off the world mark
(14:28.09) and cheered on by an appreciative crowd.
	   ``Just maybe if it had been not quite so cold, who knows what
could have happened,'' she said.
	   The featured 100-meter event with Marion Jones of the U.S., the
world's best the past two years, fizzled when Jones pulled out
hours before with a sore thigh.
	   Chrystie Gaines of the U.S. won in 10.95 seconds, finishing .02
ahead of Debbie Ferguson of the Bahamas. Merlene Ottey, the
semi-retired veteran from Jamaica, was third in 11.01.
	   ``Usually, something happens to let me win in Stockholm,''
Gaines said. ``In 1996 a couple of people pulled out, in 1997 I was
injured but I have come here now and Marion pulls out. This meet is
my good-luck charm.''
	   Wilson Boit Kipketer sounded disappointed despite winning the
men's 3,000-meter steeplechase in 8:06.13 minutes, about 10 seconds
off the world mark (7:55.72).
	   ``I think it isn't very likely that a new record will come this
season,'' said the Kenyan who ran a world seasonal best of 8:01.05
last month in Stuttgart, Germany. ``I thought my best chance was in
Stockholm.''
	   Kenyans finished 1-2-3 in the steeplechase. Bernard Barmasai
placed second in 8:07.09, and Paul Kosgei third in 8:10.23.
	   In other events, Tyree Washington won the men's 400 in 44.78,
leading a 1-2 United States finish. Alvin Harrison was second in
45.09.
	   Jonathan Edwards of Britain, another world-record holder, won
the triple jump with a last-round effort of 16.99.
	   Former world champion Maria Mutola of Mozambique won the women's
800 in 1:56.71 for another Olympic Stadium record.

Low level of play, low attendance plague worlds
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Blame the NBA and its players.
	   For the shortage of stellar play, for the empty seats, for the
overall lackluster feel of this World Basketball Championship,
which resumes Friday with the quarterfinals.
	   Even without its Dream Team, the U.S. squad joins Yugoslavia and
Russia as the prime gold medal contenders. But it could be a hollow
victory for any of the teams.
	   The matchups are: United States vs. Italy, Spain vs. Greece,
Lithuania vs. Russia, and Argentina vs. Yugoslavia.
	   ``There are several countries that are supposed to be better
than us,'' Spanish coach Lolo Sainz said. ``But you can be certain,
certain, certain that there is no one out there that scares us.
Anyone is beatable.''
	   That's been the case in preliminary round-robin action.
	   Lithuania upset the Americans, but also lost to Australia _
which didn't even reach the final eight _ and faded badly in a
defeat against Spain. Yugoslavia needed overtime to get past Russia
and lost to Italy for the first time since 1984 at a worlds or
Olympics.
	   With the league lockout looming, the NBA stars threatened to
boycott the world championship. USA Basketball reacted by dumping
what would have been Dream Team IV _ the first three versions went
24-0, winning one world and two Olympic titles _ in mid-June.
	   Other countries, including Yugoslavia and Lithuania, are also
without their NBAers, and the overall talent level is low.
	   So is the attendance. A majority of the games so far _ host
Greece's outings are the exception _ have been played before crowds
numbering in the low thousands, even hundreds.
	   ``Maybe the Dream Team would have been blowing people out by 30,
40 or 70 points,'' said guard Jimmy Oliver, whose 14 points per
game average leads the United States. ``There are always going to
be comparisons made, but I could care less about that stuff.''
	   He paused before adding: ``Hey, if we win the gold medal then go
ahead and compare.''
	   Most teams have been shuttling in at least 10 players _ U.S.
coach Rudy Tomjanovich uses all 12 _ each game, in part because of
the physical nature of international play.
	   But it's also because no one seems to have a starting five
that's capable of controlling a game.
	   And if Greece loses to Spain on Friday, organizers face the
embarrassing prospect of medal-round games before thousands of
empty seats at the 18,000-capacity Olympic arena.

Advancing Congo rebels deny Rwandan invasion
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ With a fresh rebellion emerging from the
same province where he began his revolution two years ago,
President Laurent Kabila now faces his former allies in the biggest
challenge to his government so far.
	   Rebels have seized control of the key cities of Bukavu and Goma
and more fighting was reported in nearby towns, government and
rebel sources reported. The victories were accompanied by
persistent reports that neighboring Rwanda has sent troops into
Congo and is orchestrating the rebellion.
	   ``Almost 400 army soldiers have come from Rwanda and have caused
Congolese bloodshed,'' Congolese government spokesman Didier
Mumengi said Wednesday.
	   But a leader of the mutineers speaking on a rebel radio station
denied Rwandan involvement.
	   ``This is a struggle of the Congolese people,'' said Arthur
Z'Ahidi Ngoma, a veteran opposition figure who was at one time
briefly jailed by Kabila's regime.
	   Ngoma was named rebel leader by a group of former government
supporters, opposition officials and soldiers in the eastern town
of Goma on Tuesday night, according to the rebel-held broadcaster.
	   A Rwandan official, who asked to remain anonymous, said Bizima
Karaha, an ethnic Tutsi and Congo's foreign minister, had arrived
in Goma, apparently to join the rebels.
	   Rwanda's President Pasteur Bizimungu denied his country was
involved in the conflict, but was noncommittal about whether it
would intervene in the future.
	   ``We do not know what the outcome will be like in Congo ... If
there should be any serious reasons to be involved, maybe we should
(become involved),'' Bizimungu said during an official visit to
Zambia.
	   Rwanda's forces played a key role last year in Kabila's victory
over longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, but the Rwandans
did not admit their involvement until earlier this year. Rwanda
trained and assisted the Banyamulenge, a group of Congolese Tutsis
from eastern Congo who were being persecuted by Mobutu's government
and became Kabila's key fighters.
	   Government officials say the same coalition of Banyamulenge and
Rwandan fighters inspired the recent mutiny and a brief battle in
Kinshasa on Monday.
	   Although the capital was calm, several Kinshasa businesses owned
by Tutsis were reportedly robbed and burned by local residents
after a dusk-to-dawn curfew was lifted.
	   Hostilities subsided Wednesday in Goma and Bukavu, the two
largest towns in Congo's eastern Kivu region. Fierce fighting,
however, was reported in Uvira, south of Bukavu, where rebels were
believed to be advancing.
	   A brief exchange of artillery and small weapons fire in the
northeastern city of Kisangani was heard by aid workers in the
city. An unnamed defense ministry official, however, insisted
loyalist troops were not under attack.
	   The rebellion began about a week after Kabila ordered all
Rwandan troops out of the country. Kabila did not explain the move.
	   Rwandan leaders have accused Kabila's government of not doing
enough to stop Hutu rebels from launching attacks on Rwanda from
Congolese territory and relations between the two countries have
been strained in recent months.
	   Zimbabwe announced plans to host a regional summit on Friday to
discuss the Congo crisis. The governments of Congo, Rwanda, Zambia,
Namibia and Uganda were preparing to attend, an official in Harare
said.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's Environmental Protection
Agency launched a five-week-long operation early Wednesday aimed at
enforcing laws against the destruction of the Atlantic forest.
	   The operation will involve 130 agents working in 22 teams that
will circulate through the remaining forest searching for irregular
activity throughout Rio de Janeiro state, said Manoel Magalhaes de
Mello Neto, enforcement director for the Environmental Protection
Agency.
	   ``Those who are caught destroying the rainforest can be
sentenced to between three and five years in jail,'' said Mello who
blames farmers opening up forested areas for agriculture and the
illegal extraction of hearts of palm for much of the destruction.
	   Rio de Janeiro is the state that lost the most forested area in
recent years with about 337,000 acres (134,000 hectares) destroyed
between 1990 and 1995.
	   The Atlantic forest once blanketed Brazil's 4,500-mile eastern
coast, today only 3 percent of its original area remains.
	   Between 1990 and 1995, the Atlantic forest lost 1,207,608 acres
(483,043 hectares) according to the National Space Research
Institute.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A lawyer for Jose de Jesus Amezcua, the
alleged head of Mexico's largest methamphetamine smuggling ring,
said Wednesday he will fight the U.S. extradition request which
resulted in his client's latest arrest.
	   The judge in the case has 70 days to rule on the extradition
request, but the process would almost certainly be drawn out _ for
months or even years _ if Amezcua's lawyers file an appeal.
	   Amezcua was cleared of money-laundering charges Tuesday, but
federal agents immediately rearrested him on the extradition
request as he walked out of a jail in the western city of
Guadalajara.
	   In June, a California federal grand jury indicted Amezcua, 32,
and his brother Luis, 34, on charges of manufacturing and
distributing methamphetamine, conspiracy to possess ephedrine, a
component of ``meth'' or ``speed,'' and continuing a criminal
enterprise.
	   Jose de Jesus Amezcua was confined to a Mexico City prison while
the judge reviews the extradition case.

	   GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) _ More than a week after residents
first complained of the smell of gas, authorities in Guadalajara
have discovered an underground pool of diesel fuel in an area that
suffered a deadly gas explosion in 1992.
	   The source of the fuel leak was under investigation, city
officials said Tuesday.
	   Workers so far have drained more than 260 gallons from the pool,
which was 90 percent water and 10 percent diesel. They were
continuing to clean up the site in eastern Guadalajara, capital of
Jalisco state.
	   Mayor Francisco Ramirez Acuna said Tuesday the leak posed no
risk of explosion.
	   In April 1992, a gas leak from an underground pipeline into an
eastern Guadalajara sewer system provoked a series of explosions
which killed at least 220 people and destroyed more than 1,400
homes and hundreds of businesses.
	   Residents' complaints of the strong smell of gas in the days
before the disaster had been ignored.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Thousands of construction workers
marched on Argentina's congress Tuesday to demand stronger safety
legislation, following a sharp increase in labor fatalities.
	   Some 730 workers died in labor-related accidents last year
compared to 850 so far this year, according to figures released by
the construction workers union, which organized the march.
	   Workers beat drums and chanted slogans as they marched through
the capital to a rally on a square facing the congress.
	   Roman Catholic Bishop Osvaldo Musto offered a prayer for five
workers who died last week at two construction sites.
	   Gerardo Martinez, a leader of the construction workers, blamed
the deaths on ``irresponsible businessmen who should go to jail.''
	   Congress on Tuesday was scheduled to discuss amendments to the
current labor safety law.

	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Police on Wednesday sent more than 30
female agents to roam the streets of Santiago as decoys to try to
stop a wave of attacks on woman drivers.
	   The decoy agents, who will pose as office workers, housewives or
college students, were described as ``personal defense experts and
selected shooters'' by police Col. Mireya Perez.
	   At least 25 women have been attacked in Santiago in recent
weeks. Two of them were killed and most were forced to go to their
banks to withdraw money.
	   Col. Perez said police decided to make public the decoy
operation ``because this will probable make assailants think twice
before acting again.''
	   The decoy agents carry handguns and radio communicators and will
be watched closely by male undervocer officers.

	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ An Italian priest who was shot several
times during a suspected robbery attempt has left Guatemala, police
said Wednesday.
	   The Rev. Pablo Sebastiano Crestani, 60, flew to Amsterdam late
Tuesday en route to Italy, accompanied by his brother.
	   On July 20, Crestani was shot four times as he left the San
Carlos de Borromeo Church in southern Guatemala City. Investigators
believe the attack came during an attempted robbery.
	   Dr. Jorge Bonilla, chief of medical services at the hospital
where Crestani was treated, said the priest's condition remains
delicate.
	   The assault on Crestani came three months after Roman Catholic
Bishop Juan Gerardi was bludgeoned to death in Guatemala City. A
fellow priest has been arrested in connection with the killing.

Elephant escapes from circus, eludes searchers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ An elephant named Jenny escaped from
a circus and vanished into woodlands in central Victoria state,
sparking a massive search operation, police said Thursday.
	   Police senior constable Peter Hart, in the normally quiet
wheat-growing town of Dunolly, said officers were checking a
reported sighting of the 1 1/4-ton elephant north of the town just
after dawn.
	   People living in the surrounding countryside were warned not to
approach the 34-year-old pachyderm, but immediately contact police.
	   Police believed the 13-foot-tall (4-meter-tall) Jenny broke free
from her tether in Perry Brothers circus after being scared by a
nearby train at about 10:30 p.m. Wednesday night.
	   Hart said the circus had been in town for several days.
	   ``They searched for her all night in the bush, but as you can
imagine it's pretty hard in the dark, but in daylight the search is
stepping up,'' he said.
	   Police and Jenny's handlers were leading the search.

Fiji economy in recession amid sugar drought
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ Fiji's economy is in recession and it is
likely to worsen because of the poor state of the sugar industry,
according to the latest quarterly review of the Reserve Bank of
Fiji.
	   The bank said Thursday the island nation's vital sugar industry
was suffering because of a nine-month drought that had devastated
crops and cut sugar production by 50 percent.
	   ``The recent boycott of cane harvesting by some farmers on the
eve of crushing start-up (in June), may further reduce sugar
production,'' the bank's review said.
	   The boycott by farmers demanding government grants to
rehabilitate cane farms has cut supplies to the country's four
mills and delayed crushing, which normally begins in June.
	   ``Recent estimates suggest sugar production will be below
200,000 (metric) tons, which is half of the 400,000 tons the
country's four sugar factories normally produce annually,'' the
review said.
	   ``If the estimates are correct, the lower sugar production will
have reduced gross domestic product by more than 7 percent over the
past two years,'' it said.
	   Some good news for the economy was a 10 percent rise in earnings
from tourism in the first six months of 1998 to U.S. dlrs 112
million (231 million Fiji dollars), Tourism Minister David
Pickering told Parliament recently.

New Jersey regulators to consider Tyson, but no decision expected
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TRENTON, New Jersey (AP) _ New Jersey regulators will meet
Thursday to consider whether Mike Tyson can return to boxing, but
they are not expected to issue a decision.
	   The state Athletic Control Board will meet in a private session
at 10 a.m. to review Tyson's application and to deliberate,
spokesman Roger Shatzkin said Wednesday.
	   ``They'll review all aspects of the record and any written
testimony that's been sent in'' in support of _ or against _ Tyson,
Shatzkin said.
	   Tyson, 32, hasn't fought since June 1997, when he bit the ears
of WBA heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield during a bout in Las
Vegas. Nevada regulators revoked his boxing license and said he
could reapply after one year.
	   Tyson opted to apply for a license in New Jersey instead.
	   Last week, he lost his temper and swore in front of regulators
after being questioned by state lawyers about the Holyfield
incident. His lawyer, wife and other supporters told the board
Tyson was remorseful for biting Holyfield and that he wants to
return to boxing.
	   After Thursday's session, board members will convene in public
again and may set a date for issuing a decision. The date must be
at least two days later, to give time for public notification.

Traditionalists show strength on homosexual vote
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Recaps previous &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANTERBURY, England (AP) _ The churches established by English
missionaries in colonial times are now giving a strongly
traditional lead to the Anglican Communion, as they demonstrated in
a struggle over the place of homosexuals in the church.
	   With African and Asian bishops in the forefront, the Lambeth
Conference declared Wednesday that homosexual relations are
``incompatible with Scripture'' and that practicing homosexuals
should not be ordained as priests. They also strongly affirmed
traditional teaching that sex is only for married couples and
prescribed abstinence for everyone else.
	   The resolution was adopted on a vote of 526 to 70, with 45
bishops abstaining. It was a defeat for liberal bishops, most
notably those in Europe and the United States.
	   ``Homosexual practice is nowhere sanctioned in Scripture ... It
is condemned in both Old and New Testaments as an immoral act, and
therefore a sin,'' said the Rt. Rev. Eustace Kamanyire, Bishop of
Ruwenzori in Uganda.
	   West African bishops had backed an even stronger motion that
condemns homosexuality ``as a sin which could only be adopted by
the church if it wanted to commit evangelical suicide.''
	   Such language drew a protest from the Rt. Rev. Catherine Roskam
of New York, who said it would harm the church's work in U.S.
cities. ``To condemn it (homosexuality) in the form it has been
condemned is evangelical suicide in my region,'' she said.
	   The Right Rev. John Spong, bishop of Newark, New Jersey and a
vigorous advocate for homosexuals, declared that the debate was ``a
great victory.''
	   ``This issue is now at the front and center of the Anglican
Communion and at the next conference I predict there will be openly
out gay bishops,'' Spong told reporters after the vote.
	   Spong has been one of the most controversial figures at the
Lambeth Conference, the once-a-decade gathering of bishops
affiliated with the Church of England. The conference can only
debate and advise, and the national churches are free to go their
own way _ as they have done on the divisive question of women
priests.
	   Many American and English bishops welcomed the conference's
stand.
	   ``The willingness of so many American church leaders to try to
legitimize homosexual behavior has foisted this difficult
discussion on the world-wide church. It has sapped our energy from
urgent tasks such as evangelism and justice for the poorest of the
poor,'' said the Rt. Rev. James Stanton, bishop of Dallas.
	   ``I stand wholeheartedly with traditional Anglican orthodoxy,
(and) see no room in the Holy Scripture or the entire Christian
tradition for any sexual activity outside of matrimony,'' said the
Most Rev. George Carey, the Archbishop of Canterbury and spiritual
leader of the communion.
	   But Carey said he feared that disagreement could lead to
divisions in the church. ``We need from this conference to pledge
ourselves to carry on listening _ listening to one another,
listening with those who disagree,'' he said.
	   The Rt. Rev. Duncan Buchanan, the Bishop of Johannesburg, South
Africa, said after the vote that this was not likely to be the last
word on the issue.
	   Ten years ago, he said, the conference refused to even consider
a resolution on homosexuality. Just two and a half weeks ago, he
said, there was very little support for promising to listen to
homosexuals _ a pledge which was included in the motion adopted
Wednesday.
	   ``One of the nice things about being an Anglican,'' Buchanan
said, ``is that you can both doubt and disagree.''

Horta rules out Timor talks until Gusmao freed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-UN-East Timor

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ East Timorese independence leader
Jose Ramos Horta on Thursday ruled out further talks on the future
of the disputed region until jailed resistance leader Xanana Gusmao
is freed by Indonesia.
	   The Nobel Peace prize laureate welcomed a deal between Portugal
and Indonesia to open talks on autonomy for the former Portuguese
colony, illegally annexed by Indonesia after a 1975 invasion.
	   Australia is the only country that recognizes Indonesian
sovereignty over East Timor.
	   But Horta said he would take no part in negotiations until
Gusmao was released.
	   ``They cannot pretend they are serious, that they want to solve
the problem of East Timor and then do not wish to release Xanana
Gusmao,'' Horta told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   ``Xanana is the only political leader with real acceptance and
credibility among the people of East Timor.''
	   Horta said he was no longer prepared to be Gusmao's proxy.
	   ``I will not continue to engage in dialogue myself with
Indonesia while Xanana remains in prison,'' he said.
	   ``They have to talk to him and to talk to him they have to
release him from prison.
	   ``It would be unfair and unworkable if Xanana is not released
... because any decision without his involvement, his imprimatur _
it will be rejected by the people of East Timor.''

Green says Demery was trigger man in Jordan murder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUMBERTON, North Carolina (AP) _ One of the men convicted of
killing basketball star Michael Jordan's father says he was wrongly
accused of pulling the trigger.
	   Daniel Green, 23, who goes by the Muslim name Lord D'Uallah,
told WRAL-TV on Wednesday that Larry Demery, the other man
convicted in the murder of James Jordan, actually fired the shots
that killed Jordan on July 23, 1993.
	   Demery testified in their trial in early 1996 that Green shot
Jordan as he slept in his car along U.S. 74 where it intersects
with Interstate 95.
	   ``I did not kill Mr. Jordan,'' said Green, serving a
life-plus-10 years sentence at a Halifax County work farm. ``It's
pretty cut and dried.''
	   Green admitted in the interview that he drove James Jordan's
Lexus, wore his watch and an NBA championship ring. He also
admitted he helped dump Jordan's body in a South Carolina swamp.
	   He said he wrote a letter to Jordan's family to explain his
version of the incident and apologize. He has not gotten a
response.
	   Green is serving his time at the Caledonia Correctional
Institution. Prison officials said Green has 12 serious infractions
on his record from altercations with other inmates.
	   Green said he has had to defend himself from fans of the NBA
superstar and from prison officials who he said are plotting
against him.
	   ``The administration is trying to cause situations to occur
where I would either be killed or kill somebody,'' Green said.
``And then, that way, they could say, `See? Didn't we tell you he
was violent?'''

Japan criticizes India, Pakistan during Hiroshima anniversary

<TEXT>
	   HIROSHIMA (AP) _ Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi used the 53rd
anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima on Thursday to urge
India and Pakistan to stop their nuclear weapons testing programs.
	   ``It is very regrettable that both India and Pakistan carried
out nuclear tests in May,'' said Obuchi, who took office last month
and appeared for the first time at the time-honored and solemn
annual ceremony of the world's first atomic attack.
	   Speaking to tens of thousands of people in Hiroshima, Obuchi
said the Japanese government was strongly urging both countries to
immediately stop nuclear testing, to unconditionally sign the
comprehensive test ban treaty, and to halt development of nuclear
weapons and the missiles that carry them.
	   India and Pakistan have come under intense international
criticism _ including the imposition of sanctions _ since carrying
out their nuclear tests, raising fears that international efforts
to reign in nuclear proliferation could be seriously damaged.
	   Ceremonies marking the anniversary of the U.S. bombing of
Hiroshima began with the offering of flowers at its Peace Park,
followed by a moment of silent prayer at 8:15 a.m. _ the exact
moment the bomb exploded above the city on Aug. 6, 1945.
	   The summer weather Thursday was hot with hazy skies. As in most
years, the moment of silence was broken only by the ringing of a
Buddhist bell and the constant chirping of cicadas.
	   Many among the estimated crowd of 50,000 clasped their hands in
prayer. Others held Buddhist prayer beads. But some passersby near
the park continued on their way to work as the bells tolled.
	   Anti-nuclear peace marches or rallies also were scheduled later
in the day in India and Pakistan.
	   Addressing the crowd in Hiroshima, Mayor Takashi Hiraoka said
the nuclear tests by those two countries raised tensions in South
Asia and shook the foundation of the world's non-nuclear
proliferation movement.
	   ``The people in Hiroshima feel a strong rage against the nuclear
tests by the two nations, and worry about inducing a chain reaction
of nuclear competition,'' Hiraoka said.
	   About 140,000 people were killed by Hiroshima's atomic bombing
as well as the firestorm and radiation that ensued in the western
city that was a major military center during World War II.
	   Three days after the Hiroshima attack, the United States dropped
a second atom bomb on Nagasaki, located on Japan's southern main
island of Kyushu, killing 70,000 people. Japan surrendered
unconditionally on Aug. 15, 1945.
	   Like the rest of Japan, Hiroshima rebuilt after the war _ except
for the wreckage of one building left on display to remind visitors
of the massive destruction. Hiroshima, 690 kilometers (425 miles)
southwest of Tokyo, is now a thriving commercial center of 1.1
million people.
	   Today, many Japanese believe the atomic bombings of the two
cities were unjustified, despite Japan's war of aggression. But
U.S. wartime leaders defended the bombings as the only alternative
to a bloody invasion of mainland Japan, and many Americans still
hold that viewpoint.

	   About 140,000 people were killed by Hiroshima's atomic bombing
as well as the firestorm and radiation that ensued in the western
city that was a major military center during World War II.
	   Three days after the Hiroshima attack, the United States dropped
a second atom bomb on Nagasaki, located on Japan's southern main
island of Kyushu, killing 70,000 people. Japan surrendered
unconditionally on Aug. 15, 1945.
	   Like the rest of Japan, Hiroshima rebuilt after the war _ except
for the wreckage of one building left on display to remind visitors
of the massive destruction. Hiroshima, 690 kilometers (425 miles)
southwest of Tokyo, is now a thriving commercial center of 1.1
million people.
	   Today, many Japanese believe the atomic bombings of the two
cities were unjustified, despite Japan's war of aggression. But
U.S. wartime leaders defended the bombings as the only alternative
to a bloody invasion of mainland Japan, and many Americans still
hold that viewpoint.

Sampras wins in post-Wimbledon return
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Agassi victory &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Pete Sampras, playing for the first time since
his Wimbledon triumph, defeated Italy's Gianluca Pozzi 6-1, 6-2
Wednesday to advance to the third round of the dlrs 2.45 million du
Maurier Open.
	   Sampras, who had minor foot surgery July 15, will cede his No. 1
ranking to Chile's Marcelo Rios if he loses in Toronto. Sampras is
on course for a quarterfinal match with Andre Agassi, the eighth
seed who advanced Wednesday night.
	   ``For my first match in a month and first on hardcourt in over
three months, it was a match where I could see the ball very well
playing someone who doesn't have a huge serve,'' Sampras said.
	   ``It gave me some time to get into a rhythm out there and feel
the surroundings and the court speed. ... I was pretty pleased with
how I played.''
	   Sampras is appearing in this event for the first time since
1990, when he lost in the semifinals.
	   The flamboyant Agassi kept pace, downing France's Guillaume
Raoux 6-4, 7-5 in a hard-hitting baseline battle before an
energetic center court gathering of 10,000 spectators. Agassi
recorded his 12th straight win in style _ with an ace _ and
continued his amazing 1998 run. The 28-year-old American has won
four tournaments this year _ including his last two _ and has
jumped 99 spots in the rankings to No. 11.
	   And Agassi has dominated this event, winning it three times. He
improved his career record to 24-4 and is an amazing 13-1 in
Toronto.
	   In other matches, No. 3 seed Patrick Rafter of Australia
defeated Neville Godwin 7-5, 6-3; No. 4 Yevgeny Kafelnikov of
Russia downed Todd Martin 6-2, 6-3; and No. 7 Tim Henman of England
outlasted Argentina's Guillermo Canas 3-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2.
	   Other seeds advancing were: No. 9 Alberto Costa of Spain, No. 10
Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia and No. 14 Mark Philippoussis of
Australia. No. 15 Fabrice Santoro of France lost 7-6 (10-8), 6-2 to
Germany's Tommy Haas.
	   Sampras is bidding to become the only player in ATP history to
be No. 1 six straight years. He shares the mark of five straight
with Jimmy Connors.
	   ``One of my main goals this year was to try to break the
record,'' Sampras said. ``Obviously, I didn't do myself any favors
with the first four months of the year when I wasn't playing that
well.''
	   Should Sampras win the upcoming U.S. Open, he'll tie Roy
Emerson's record of 12 career Grand Slam tournament titles.
	   ``When it's over, it's over, and I'll look back and appreciate
what I've done,'' he said.
	   Rod Laver and Bjorn Borg have won 11 Grand Slam tournaments
each. Laver, Sampras' boyhood idol, is recovering from a stroke.
	   ``I was fortunate enough to have seen Rod play when he was in
his prime,'' Sampras said. ``I've thought about him quite a bit
over the past couple of weeks after his stroke, and I certainly
hope I can get a chance to talk to him.''

Dollar higher in Tokyo, Japanese stocks mixed in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen in early
trading Thursday after an overnight rebound on Wall Street.
Japanese stock prices turned mixed.
	   The dollar bought 143.74 yen, up 0.36 yen from late Wednesday in
Tokyo but below its late New York rate of 143.86 yen overnight.
	   Traders said the dollar held its relative strength as Japanese
investors and overseas players bought dollars during morning
trading.
	   It was also supported following an overnight rise on Wall
Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average gained 59.47 points
Wednesday, snapping back from its 299-point loss Tuesday.
	   The dollar's movements, however, will likely remain in ranges
ahead of Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's policy speech
Friday, although market participants do not expect any significant
surprises, dealers said.
	   Meanwhile, stock prices moved little in early trading as many
investors held back to await Friday's speech.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 0.75 points, negligible
in percentage terms, to 15,991.41 points in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Wednesday, the Nikkei index closed down 31.42 points,
or 0.20 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 1.62 points, or 0.13 percent, to 1,237.40
points. The TOPIX closed down 1.17 points, or 0.09 percent, the day
before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.205 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.225
percent, driving its price up to 111.75 yen from 111.61 yen.

U.N. weapons chief softens tone, says `creative' solutions needed
</HEADLINE>
with Iraq &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Recaps Iraq and Butler-Iraq. &QL; 
 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Already facing an Iraqi freeze in
cooperation, the chief U.N. weapons inspector will find little
consolation when he meets with the Security Council.
	   Richard Butler blames the Iraqis for the breakdown in talks this
week that led President Saddam Hussein on Wednesday to declare a
freeze on dealings with the inspectors.
	   But some members of the powerful U.N. Security Council, eager to
end seven years of sanctions on Iraq, will likely blame Butler when
the chief inspector briefs them on Thursday.
	   ``We are strongly convinced that Iraq is not the only one to
blame for this situation,'' Yuriy Fedotov, Russia's No. 2 man at
the United Nations, said after a council meeting Wednesday.
	   He said Butler stopped the talks Monday without consulting his
bosses in New York _ the council and Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   Butler strongly denied that, saying Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz ended the talks when Butler refused to declare the
Iraqis in full compliance with the inspection program.
	   ``What is at issue here is the decisions of the Security Council
which are binding in international law,'' Butler said before
meeting with Annan on Wednesday ``Whether or not Iraq is prepared
to accept that law is what is at issue.''
	   Iraq has been trying to get international sanctions lifted. The
sanctions, imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, cannot be
lifted by the council until the U.N. inspectors certify Iraq has
destroyed all its chemical and biological weapons and long-range
missiles. The sanctions ban Iraq from freely exporting its most
valuable commodity _ oil.
	   Russia, along with France, want to accelerate the end of
sanctions. Both countries have financial interests in Iraq.
	   Over the years, Fedotov said, Iraq has cooperated in dismantling
many of its illegal weapons.
	   ``Unfortunately, there have been no real positive moves from the
Security Council, from the U.N., to recognize these achievements,''
Fedotov said.
	   In a 38-page letter to the Council, Aziz accused the inspectors
of raising trivial matters _ a ploy, he said, to extend the
sanctions and to please the United States and Britain.
	   But even those countries _ Iraq's toughest critics on the
15-nation Security Council _ are beginning to sound weary of this
fight.
	   The State Department on Wednesday described Hussein's freeze as
nothing worse than ``disturbing'' _ although a refusal earlier this
year to allow access to inspectors nearly led to war.
	   Butler could also expect little backing from Annan, who brokered
a February agreement that averted the war and has invested much
political capital in ensuring the agreement's success.
	   Butler emerged from an hour-long meeting with his boss Wednesday
looking chastened and speaking of ``creative'' solutions to end
Iraq's ``worrying'' sanctions _ unusual diplomatic language for the
technician.
	   Annan postponed a trip to Portugal so he could attend the
Security Council meeting, reflecting the seriousness he attaches to
the latest impasse.
	   Butler said he found Aziz's stance puzzling because the
commission is close to saying Iraq has no weapons of mass
destruction in some areas.
	   He said Aziz continued to refuse to hand over a document found
last month by U.N. weapons inspectors, detailing types of bombs and
rockets that Iraq has said were used to deliver chemical and
biological agents.
	   ``Tariq Aziz refused to give it to me and said `you will never
get it.'''

Minister: Deal gives U.S. company option to buy Fiji tuna cannery
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT KEITH REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ A government-owned tuna cannery may soon be
taken over by U.S. company Bumble Bee Seafoods, Fiji's Agriculture
and Fisheries Minister Militoni Leweniqila said Thursday.
	   Leweniqila said the Pacific Fiji Company Ltd., operator of a
cannery at Levuka, on Ovalau island, 60 miles (100 kms) from Suva,
will enter into a five year tuna loining contract with Bumble Bee.
	   The new contract will succeed an expiring 12-month trial during
which the U.S. company supplied the cannery with fish.
	   Under the five year deal, Bumble Bee can purchase the cannery
within the first 12 months of the new contract.
	   The Levuka cannery has a canning capacity of more than 15,000
(metric) tons and has preferential access to European Union markets
under the Lome trade and aid agreement that the union has with 70
African, Caribbean and Pacific Island states.
	   Bumble Bee Seafoods Inc., based in San Diego, is one of the
world's largest distributors of canned tuna and salmon and the
second largest tuna producer in the United States.
	   Its share of the total canned tuna market is 23 percent,
compared with 45 percent for Star-Kist Foods and 14 percent for
Chicken of the Sea. In premium white meat tuna, Bumble Bee has a 39
percent market share.
	   Bumble Bee has processing plants in Santa Fe Springs near Los
Angeles; Mayaguez, Puerto Rico; and Manta, Ecuador. The company
employs about 3,000 people.
	   In May, Bumble Bee was bought from its financially troubled Thai
parent company by a Dallas-based investment firm that owns Chef
Boyardee pastas.
	   The purchaser was Hicks, Muse, Tate and Furst Inc., a leading
private investment firm. It bought Bumble Bee through a subsidiary,
International Home Foods, a leading American manufacturer and
marketer of well-known supermarket staples.

Slayings illustrate volatile _ and unending _ struggle over land

	   AIN AFOOS, West Bank (AP) _ The Jewish settlement is on the
hilltop, the Palestinian village is in the valley, and violence is
the middle ground on which they meet.
	   Israelis awakened Wednesday to the news that a pair of young
Jewish settlers had been gunned down overnight, shot at close range
as they patrolled the outskirts of their isolated hilltop
settlement.
	   Politicians expressed dismay and resolve. The funerals _ always
held swiftly here, for Muslim and Jew alike _ brought an outpouring
of anger and grief. The Israeli and Palestinian governments engaged
in a ritual round of finger-pointing.
	   But far less attention was paid to the slayings' larger
backdrop: the grinding, low-level war that plays itself out daily
on the periphery of settlements scattered throughout the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
	   It's a war of attrition. A sheep slaughtered, an olive tree
uprooted, a road carved out of a hillside, a field burned. Taunts
and fisticuffs, demonstrations and lawsuits.
	   And sometimes, a flareup of deadly force.
	   The Palestinian village of Ain Afoos nestles below a steep-sided
hilltop that is home to the Jewish settlement of Itzhar. Literally
and figuratively, the villagers feel constantly in its shadow.
	   ``Once, these hills were holy places, where hermits would come
to pray,'' said Hashem Ahlan, 65, the patriarch of a Palestinian
clan and owner of a swath of farmland on the village's edge. ``Look
what happens here now.''
	   Part of what makes the conflict so intractable is that neither
side acknowledges any legitimacy to the other's claims.
	   Itzhar is a close-knit community of about 300 people, virtually
all religious Jews, true believers in what they consider a biblical
claim to the West Bank. The Palestinians, already feeling
dispossessed and deprived, consider even a small settlement like
Itzhar an all-encompassing threat.
	   For as long as almost anyone can remember, there has been bad
blood between villagers in the valley and the settlers above.
	   The villagers accuse the settlers of a systematic campaign to
seize their land, by terrorizing them if necessary. The settlers
deny any aggressive acts, and say Wednesday's killings show they
are the ones under siege.
	   Ahlan the farmer, clad in a long white robe, white burnoose and
sandals, showed a scar on his arm where he says a settler's bullet
grazed him six years ago. He said he'd rather fight them in court
than on the ground.
	   When settlers set up trailers on his land, he went to Israel's
Supreme Court and won an eviction order, which the Israeli army
carried out.
	   The settlers of Itzhar have their own fears and grievances. The
Israeli army, they say, has denied some of them permits for weapons
they say they need for self-defense. Surrounded by Palestinian
villages, their isolation sometimes turns edgy.
	   Ahlan called Wednesday's shooting ``very bad, very dangerous,''
predicting it would spur settlers' efforts to acquire more land.
Israeli media reported that within hours of the shooting, the
settlement had asked for government permission to expand.
	   The conflict in these hills, which fall within
Israeli-controlled territory, spills over into the nearby
Palestinian-run city of Nablus, six miles (10 km) away.
	   The slain settlers were both students at Joseph's Tomb, a Jewish
seminary in Nablus that has been a focal point of past
confrontations between Palestinians and Jewish settlers.
	   Six Israeli soldiers died in fighting with Palestinian troops in
1996 at the enclave _ near what Jews believe is the burial site of
the biblical figure Joseph.
	   After Wednesday's shooting, the government dispatched a team of
social workers to the settlement to try to calm passions.
	   ``Everyone is angry and uncertain and disconcerted,'' said
social worker Pinchas Gerber, who arrived at the settlement before
dawn Wednesday to begin setting up counseling sessions.
	   Beneath a tree on one of the settlement's streets, 9-year-old
Pinchas Mansovsky scratched his sunburned nose as he watched the
adults preparing for the afternoon's burial.
	   His eyes were red and swollen, but he said that was sleepiness,
not sadness. The commotion after the shootings kept him awake most
of the night, he said.
	   ``That's all it is,'' he said. ``I'm not afraid to live here.''

Decade after bloody uprising, Myanmar's military retains power

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Anger smolders at home and
international criticism runs hot, but Myanmar's generals show no
signs of easing the iron grip they have held since crushing a
democracy movement 10 years ago.
	   Since the summer of 1988, when thousands of protesters faced
bayonets and bullets in Myanmar, dictatorial regimes from eastern
Europe to Southeast Asia have fallen to democratic demands.
	   But after 36 years in control, Myanmar's junta is proving a
durable institution, having outlasted Suharto's authoritarian
regime in Indonesia and the era of military coups in neighboring
Thailand.
	   An exiled rebel leader, Aung Naing Oo, sees two opposing fears
working to keep Myanmar quiet. ``People are afraid of imprisonment,
torture, loss of jobs if they rise up. And the military is afraid
of retribution if it loses control,'' he said.
	   Recent travelers from Yangon, the capital, say the general mood
is tense with the approach of key dates tied to the 1988 unrest,
such as Saturday _ the 10th anniversary of a nationwide protest
strike. Requests for visas by foreign journalists are being
rejected.
	   The small, but vocal band of open opponents to the junta is
ratcheting up the pressure.
	   Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the 1988 demonstrations and
winner of the Nobel Peace Prize for her pro-democracy work, has set
Aug. 21 as the deadline for the generals to convene a national
assembly that was elected in 1990 but never recognized by the
military.
	   She also has vowed to make more trips outside Yangon despite
being stopped at a rural roadblock for six days in late July and
then forcibly returned to her home in the capital.
	   But despite strong international backing, Suu Kyi and her
followers _ their ranks withered by jailings _ have little
maneuvering room because it is doubtful the populace is ready to
again risk death in the streets.
	   ``I don't think anything will really change as long as the
military hangs together. They know that if they crack they are
finished,'' said Bertil Lintner, a Myanmar expert based in Bangkok.
``The opposition holds the moral high ground and public support but
that's about it. Change has to come from the top.''
	   Lintner notes that unlike other Asian countries where military
regimes were satisfied with just holding the political reins,
Myanmar's generals entrenched themselves in every sector and
ensured no other power centers developed to challenge their
authority.
	   As traditional hotbeds of dissent, Myanmar's universities have
been slammed shut whenever students merged in protest, despite the
damage this has caused to the country's development. In the latest
crackdown, colleges have been closed since December 1996.
	   After crushing the democracy movement, the generals stepped up
attacks on the other threat to its rule _ the welter of ethnic
minority groups that have fought for greater autonomy since
independence from Britain in 1948.
	   Truces have been signed with some groups. For others, like the
Karen and Karenni peoples, holding out has brought military attacks
in which civilians endure rape, murder, forced induction as porters
and burned villages, according to refugees and human rights groups.
	   The generals keep a firm hand on the economy, but unlike the
socialistic days before 1988, they have allowed a fair degree of
private enterprise and opening to the outside world.
	   With this has come the emergence of a fledgling middle class,
which from all evidence resents the military but is leery of
risking its material gains by agitating for political change.
	   Josef Silverstein, a longtime Myanmar scholar at Rutgers
University in New Jersey,thinks time is working against the regime.
	   ``They've got nothing going for them. They've got no money, no
friends and they can have an uprising on their hands at any time,''
he said. ``I don't think they'll fall on their swords. They'll
choke because they have no money.''
	   Analysts like Silverstein see the economy as the regime's
Achilles heel, recalling the uprising a decade ago was in large
part fueled by rice shortagesand other economic problems.
	   The final spark was a minor incident _ a brawl in a tea shop on
March 12, 1988, that led to student demonstrations, which were
later joined by ordinary citizens, monks, civil servants and even
some members of the military. They climaxed in a nationwide strike
Aug. 8, but a month later the military was back in total control
after killing hundreds, if not thousands, of protesters.
	   After some years of economic gains, Myanmar, which is still
called Burma by some, is again being wracked by soaring inflation,
a dropping currency, rice shortages and a lack of investment
because of the economic crisis that has hit Asia.
	   ``The Burmese authorities must learn that they can't go against
the will of the people forever,'' Suu Kyi said in a recent
interview.

Neo-Nazi party says will fight to defend Hanson's partisans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The neo-Nazi National Action group
said Thursday it was prepared to use violence to defend right-wing
populist supporters of Pauline Hanson attacked by protesters at One
Nation rallies.
	   Students have been rallying to shout down Hanson, an independent
member of Parliament from Queensland, and her One Nation party
members at their gatherings.
	   ``We've also been the target of the same mobs and although we
don't turn the other cheek the way One Nation does, we don't think
that these mobs should get away with it,'' National Action chairman
Michael Brander told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   ``We would do what we have done. When leftists have attacked us
at our rallies they've been beaten, physically beaten back and if
that's violent, it's simply self-defense,'' he said.
	   Members of National Action and other extreme right-wing groups
attended Tuesday's rowdy One Nation rally in Ipswich, Queensland,
prompting a violent response from demonstrators.
	   But Brander said his group had no intention of provoking
violence.
	   ``We haven't made it our business to attend for that purpose,''
he said.
	   ``Don't ask me if there's going to be violence at One Nation
meetings, ask the people who instigate the violence,'' he said.
	   Hanson's One Nation party drew about 25 percent of the vote in
Queensland's state election in June, electing 11 members to the
state's Parliament.
	   If it performs that well in the national election that must be
held before March 1999, it may well win the balance of power in the
Australian Parliament.

Sugiyama upsets Graf at Toshiba Classic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be updated with Martinez day singles match, Seles night
match. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CARLSBAD, California (AP) _ Japan's Ai Sugiyama overcame cramps
and a late-match deficit to stun former world No. 1 Steffi Graf
6-4, 1-6, 7-5 Wednesday in the dlrs 450,000 Toshiba Tennis Classic.
	   Sugiyama, ranked 17th in the world, called for an injury timeout
after hitting a backhand winner that set up her fourth match point
in the final game of the third set. Sugiyama, suffering from cramps
in her right hamstring and right quadriceps, was treated by a WTA
Tour trainer for nearly three minutes before closing out the
victory.
	   Calling it the ``best match'' of her career, Sugiyama rebounded
from third-set deficits of 2-0 and 5-4 with Graf serving and
needing just two points to win the second-round match.
	   ``This time I played my best tennis,'' said Sugiyama, comparing
her play with her only other meeting with Graf, earlier this year
at Indian Wells. Graf cruised to a 6-0, 6-1 victory.
	   Graf, a four-time winner here, most recently in 1994, suffered
her first loss in the event in 22 matches.
	   ``It's obviously very disappointing,'' she said. ``I played
really well last night and I was going for my shots. I didn't
really do that today from the beginning.''
	   Graf returned to the tour in February after an eight-month
absence because of various injuries. Her world ranking has dropped
to No. 44, although she was seeded sixth here.
	   In other second-round matches, top-seeded Martina Hingis scored
a 6-3, 6-2 win over Natasha Zvereva of Belarus and South Africa's
Joannette Kruger beat former French Open champion Iva Majoli 6-3,
7-6 (7-1).
	   The momentum of the Graf-Sugiyama match changed repeatedly.
Sugiyama won the first set when she scored the only service break
in the ninth game.
	   It appeared Graf had regained control when she took a
competitive second set and won the first two games of the third.
But Sugiyama surprisingly reeled off four consecutive games,
breaking Graf's serve twice as she allowed her German counterpart
just one point in the two games.
	   Graf took a 5-4 lead on her third break of the set and was
serving for the match. Just two points away from victory, however,
Graf failed to close out the win as Sugiyama broke her serve again
to tie the match.
	   Sugiyama went ahead 6-5 before Graf staved off three match
points in the final game. Graf had two chances to tie the match and
send it into a tiebreak, but failed each time.
	   Following Sugiyama's injury timeout, Graf hit a forehand into
the net to end the match.
	   ``She played some amazing shots when it was important,'' Graf
said. ``She really went after everything.''
	   The Hingis-Zvereva score did not reflect the tight nature of the
match.
	   ``Any time I played her,'' Hingis said, ``she gives me a hard
time. ``She's a very smart player, very clever.''
	   Hingis hadn't played in a tournament since losing in the
semifinals of Wimbledon July 2. But the Swiss teen-ager responded
each time Zvereva challenged.
	   Hingis, whose only action since Wimbledon came in a Fed Cup
match in late July, said she was glad to face Zvereva in her first
match of the tournament.
	   ``I'm quite happy that I played Zvereva because she gives you a
lot of time to prepare yourself. She's not one of the big hitters
... You just get the feel of the court.''

City site yields Ice Age animals that sank into history

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Step carefully down the ladder into the
black, oozing pit 13 1-2 feet (4 meters) below the bustling heart
of Los Angeles and you're staring into a treasure trove of Ice Age
animals that literally sank into history.
	   Mammoths and mastodons, saber-tooth cats and dire wolves, camels
and bison, land sloths and land snails became ensnared by sticky
asphalt that migrated upward through cracks and fissures from the
Salt Lake Oilfield 1,000 feet (300 meters) down.
	   Millions of their bones have been extracted from the
world-famous La Brea Tar Pits, wedged between museums, office
buildings and condo towers in the middle of the bustling
Wilshire-Fairfax district.
	   They're not really pits, but murky puddles of water, seeping
asphalt and bubbling methane that dot the only Ice Age fossil
excavation site inside a major metropolitan area.
	   Rancho La Brea _ Spanish for ``the tar ranch'' _ is more than
just a tourist stop on the way to Hollywood or a school field trip.
It's a renowned scientific resource.
	   ``It's the standard for life in North America in the last phase
of the Ice Age,'' says John Harris, chief curator and head of
paleontology at the Page Museum of the La Brea Tar Pits, part of
the Los Angeles Museum of Natural History.
	   ``No other place in the world has these extinct animals as
well-preserved and in such abundance,'' says William A. Akersten, a
former supervising curator of Rancho La Brea.
	   Rancho La Brea features 650 species, many extinct, and the
remains of the 9,000-year-old La Brea Woman. Her partial skull
suggests a blow to the head that may make her L.A.'s earliest
homicide.
	   Asphalt is the crudest of petroleum products and a remarkable
preservative that fills the tiny pores of bones. It's so effective
that it has protected bird bones that commonly disintegrate.
Washing away most of the asphalt with solvents leaves behind a
stunning sheen.
	   The asphalt deposits were shallow self-baiting traps that acted
``like flypaper spread over the surface,'' Harris says. ``It only
takes 1 1-2 inches of asphalt to totally immobilize an animal the
size of a cow.''
	   Once a large grazing animal got stuck, meat-eating predators
would approach and get trapped, followed by the scavengers and
insects that feasted on rotting remains.
	   ``Pretty soon, you've brought up the whole food chain,'' Harris
says.
	   In summer, warm asphalt flowed over the remains. During winter
rains, streams deposited silt and sand atop the asphalt.
Eventually, cone-shaped deposits buried the bones.
	   In July, on one of year's hottest days _ when the asphalt was
warm and viscous _ the Page Museum opened Pit 91 to reporters.
	   At the bottom, blackened bones criss-cross like a child's game
of pick-up sticks _ a femur jutting out here, a skull there.
	   Protected by an overhead tarpaulin, volunteer excavators perched
on wooden planks scrape away the rough mixture of asphalt, sand,
seeds, leaves, twigs and ancient insect parts that cling to bones
about 28,000 years old.
	   They work one 3-foot-by-3-foot (90-centimeter-by-90-centimeter)
grid at a time, using dental tools, brushes, chisels and
screwdrivers to define the bones, said Meghan Howard Meyer, 27, as
she removed asphalt around two saber-tooth cat skulls.
	   ``I love getting a gooey bone to work on,'' said Karolyn Knoll,
20, a geology student at the University of Wisconsin at River
Falls.
	   The two showed off the day's find, a tiny dermal ossicle, one of
the protective bones embedded in the fur and skin of the giant
ground sloth that would give any biting predator pause.
	   A few yards from the excavation, volunteer guide Ellen Bernick
made sure to correct visitors' misimpression about the tar pits
from the movie ``Volcano,'' in which a fictional volcano erupted at
the site.
	   ``We don't erupt, we seep,'' Ms. Bernick said.

Duffer tees off at 40 golf courses in one day

	   RENO, Nevada (AP) _ Don ``Snoshu'' Thompson hit 40 drives and
lost all 40 golf balls Wednesday, but he didn't take a mulligan and
he didn't seem to mind.
	   ``See you later men,'' he yelled to a dozen golfers on the first
tee at Brookside Municipal Golf Course after he drove the ball into
the left rough, turned around and jogged back to his car.
	   Thompson, 68, didn't have time to look for his ball.
	   He was trying to make tee times at 43 golf courses in the
Reno-Lake Tahoe area in a 12-hour period in an effort to showcase
the region as an up-and-coming golfing destination. He ended up
with 40 for the day after three private clubs on his list wouldn't
allow him on the tee.
	   ``I guess I'm part of this insanity,'' said his 37-year-old
daughter Randi, who was along for the ride. ``It's his shag bag _
driving range balls he's hitting.
	   ``My dad wouldn't leave a good ball behind. He's too
conservative.''
	   The father, a local golf and skiing writer who owns a tavern in
Reno, planned the event with city officials determined to bolster
their tourism base as legalized gambling spreads elsewhere.
	   ``In the last two or three years, there have probably been 10
new golf courses open,'' said Beverly Loranger, spokeswoman for the
Reno-Sparks Convention and Visitors Authority.
	   ``It has been kind of a quiet little secret people don't know
about.''
	   For his last stunt, ``Snoshu'' skied at 15 area resorts in the
same day.
	   ``The Guinness Book of World Records turned me down when I did
15 ski lifts in one day, but I'm going to try again,'' Thompson
said Wednesday before he teed off at Red Hawk Golf Course in
Spanish Springs, northeast of Reno, at 6:05 a.m.
	   The left-hander, literally running from idling car to tee and
back, booked a tight schedule that took him up the Sierra Nevada to
Lake Tahoe and back to Reno _ 401 miles (642 kilometers) total over
three mountain passes.
	   Despite a slow start, he completed the task by teeing off at his
final destination, Washoe Municipal Golf Course, 22 minutes ahead
of his 5:55 p.m. tee time.
	   Three private courses _ Lahonton, Glenbrook and Montreaux _
wouldn't let him tee off due to their exclusive policies but
Thompson said he took no offense.
	   Reno's location at the base of the Sierra Nevada and the edge of
the Great Basin accounts for wide variety of geography encountered
in the 43 courses Thompson targeted within one hour of the city of
143,000.
	   They ranged from the 6,000-foot (1,800-meter) mountain courses
along Lake Tahoe, to narrow links layouts in the swamps of Washoe
Valley to the southeast and the desert courses to the north and
east where temperatures neared a 102-degree Fahrenheit (39-degree
Celsius) record Wednesday.

Study: Some sick babies exposed to secondhand smoke from crack

cocaine &QL;

<TEXT>
	   NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (AP) _ Many infants brought into city
hospital emergency rooms may be suffering from exposure to
secondhand smoke from crack cocaine, according to a new study from
the Yale School of Medicine.
	   The study showed that between one-sixth and one-third of
children under 1 year old who were sick enough to require urine
tests at a city emergency room may have been exposed to crack
smoke.
	   The children tested were about 13 percent of the overall number
of infants seen at Yale-New Haven Hospital between December 1993
and September 1994, according to the study published last month in
the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
	   The study also showed that many of the children whose urine
tested positive for crack cocaine suffered from respiratory
problems such as wheezing and coughing.
	   Researchers presume that the exposure is from secondhand smoke,
likely from the children's parents or other caretakers, and not
from ingesting cocaine directly.
	   ``We're pretty sure it's passive cocaine exposure, but we're not
100 percent sure where the cocaine came from,'' said the study's
principal investigator, Dr. Andrew S. Lustbader. ``You have to
assume people are not giving their children cocaine, but
unfortunately we don't exactly know.''
	   The researchers stressed that the urine samples were routine and
were ordered to determine the cause of the children's illnesses _
not because cocaine exposure was suspected. The samples were
anonymous and were not used for any law enforcement purposes.
	   They examined 124 random urine samples from 122 sick children.
About 36 percent of them tested positive for cocaine exposure;
close to 19 percent appeared to have some level of exposure, but
the results were inconclusive.
	   Close to 64 percent of the children who tested positive were
suffering from stomach problems, most accompanied by fever, and 67
percent had respiratory problems, such as wheezing. The children
who tested positive for cocaine exposure also had medical histories
that showed they had more illnesses requiring medical attention.
	   Babies younger than 4 days old were not included in the study to
eliminate the possibility that the exposure was prenatal.
	   The researchers cautioned that many mothers of children who
tested positive for cocaine did not report being crack cocaine
users themselves.
	   Doctors have long recognized that many babies exposed to cocaine
in the womb _ so-called crack babies _ suffer from a variety of
health problems, including low birth weight and attention deficit
disorder.
	   Doctors also know that passive exposure to smoke from crack
cocaine is a potential health hazard for children, but the extent
of that hazard has not been clearly defined.
	   The researchers stressed that more study is needed to confirm
the results, as well as to determine the long-term health effects
and rate of death in children exposed to crack smoke.
	   Lustbader said he hoped the report would make doctors more aware
that children coming into the emergency room could have had such
exposure.
	   ``We think after other studies are done like this, it would be
wise, for populations that are at risk, to test for cocaine in
little kids who come into the emergency room _ not to report it ...
but to find out what's wrong with them,'' Lustbader said.
	   ``The problem, though, is of course that if parents feel their
kids are going to be tested for cocaine, they may be slower to
bring them into the hospital.''
	   The researchers conceded that the findings may have been skewed
because all study subjects were seen in an inner-city hospital that
serves a high-risk population and the test methods used were highly
sensitive, having a lower threshold for testing positive than those
used for adults.
	   Another limit to the study was a lack of information regarding
exposure to cigarette smoke in the home and whether the children
could have been exposed to cocaine directly through breast feeding,
although the study's authors said breast feeding did not appear to
be the primary source of exposure.
	   The number of children who tested positive was only a small
portion of all those who entered the emergency room. During the
study period, doctors in the emergency room saw a total of 2,548
children younger than 1 year old. About 13 percent of them were
sick enough to warrant urine tests; of those children, the study
examined the urine samples of about half.

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Polar bears fear nothing they can see in
their icy domain _ but they can't see PCBs, and scientists worry
the bears are succumbing to the invisible invaders.
	   Last year, researchers in Norway's remote Svalbard islands
reported they found seven female polar bears with vestigial male
organs. Research team leader Andrew Derocher says the anomaly may
be caused by toxic chemicals.
	   Derocher, a Canadian affiliated with the Norwegian Polar
Institute, will lead a team to the Svalbards to try to determine
whether PCBs and other toxins have affected polar bears' immune
systems.
	   ``We are going to study the Svalbard bears, which is the most
polluted population in the world, and compare them with a low-end
population in Canada,'' he said.
	   The Svalbard archipelago, just 960 kilometers (600 miles) from
the North Pole, might seem to be about as far as possible from
man's pollution.
	   But the islands are at a crossroads of air and ocean currents,
bringing pollution from distant industrial sites in Europe, North
America and even Asia.
	   The level of PCBs _ polychlorinated biphenyls _ in the Svalbards
is at least 2.5 times higher than in Canada's polar bear territory,
Derocher said. Other scientists have reported levels of PCBs in
Svalbard bears 10 times higher than in Alaska.
	   PCBs, chemical compounds once widely used in plastics and
electrical insulation, were banned in the United States in the
1970s and are restricted under international agreements. But it
takes years, even decades, for them to break down.
	   PCBs dissolve readily in animal fat, such as blubber, and stay
there. A polar bear's favorite food is seal blubber.
	   Derocher and his team are headed to Svalbard for an Aug. 8-16
study in which they plan to mark attach radio-tracking devices to
30 adult bears and up to 20 cubs and give them vaccine designed to
test their immune systems.
	   Then, four to six weeks later, they will track down the same
bears to see how their immune system responded to the vaccine.
	   ``We want to test the ability of the immune system in these high
pollution bears,'' he said. The results will be compared with
Canadian bears to be tested next year in Wapsuk National Park.
	   He said the level of PCBs found in Svalbard's bears are similar
to those shown to have caused damage to seals, otters and mink,
ranging from short-term memory loss to sterility and a reduced
ability to withstand disease.
	   Derocher said the Svalbards and the ice-pack to the north
probably sustain a population of 4,000-5,000 bears in a
250,000-square-kilometer (100,000-square-mile) area, where they
have no natural enemies. The population of bears, which grow to
200-400 kilograms (440- to 880-pounds), has appeared stable since
Norway banned hunting them 25 years ago.
	   But if their immune systems are weakened or fail, that could
quickly change, he said.
	   ``If they were hit by a disease, there could be a great impact
in decades, even in years,'' Derocher said. ``It is certainly
something to be concerned about,'' he said about the toxins.

Elephant escapes from circus, eludes searchers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS elephant's name, adds reports of near-sightings &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ An elephant named Ginny escaped from
a circus and vanished into woodlands in central Victoria state,
sparking a massive search operation, police said Thursday.
	   Police senior constable Peter Hart, in the normally quiet
wheat-growing town of Dunolly, said officers were checking a
reported sighting of the 1 1/4-ton elephant north of the town just
after dawn.
	   People living in the surrounding countryside were warned not to
approach the 34-year-old pachyderm, but immediately contact police.
	   Police believed the 13-foot-tall (4-meter-tall) Ginny broke free
from her tether in Perry Brothers circus after being scared by a
nearby train at about 10:30 p.m. Wednesday night.
	   Hart said the circus had been in town for several days.
	   ``They searched for her all night in the bush, but as you can
imagine it's pretty hard in the dark, but in daylight the search is
stepping up,'' he said.
	   Police and Ginny's handlers were leading the search, with help
from townspeople and schoolchildren.
	   But the owner of Perry Brothers Circus, Lorraine Maynard, said
they were ``one farm behind her all the time.''
	   ``We've seen where she's been, but we haven't caught up with
her.''
	   Maynard said elephants were not as easy to spot as people
believed.
	   ``With elephants, they can just stand alongside a gum tree and
you can walk right past them and you wouldn't know they were
there,'' she said.
	   ``She might have come out of the bush and she could be in
someone's paddock, standing having a feed with their sheep or their
cows and their horses.''
	   She said Ginny was gentle and not dangerous.
	   Local resident Dorothy Smith said she received a shock after she
went out to her verandah at 7 a.m. and decided to call out to the
elephant as a joke.
	   ``Blow me down, I got a trumpet call,'' she said.
	   The trumpeting had come from nearby scrub.
	   But again, Ginny was nowhere in sight.

Prince Charles sets up modern architectural foundation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prince Charles is setting up a new architectural
foundation and hopes to call a truce between modern and traditional
styles.
	   The Foundation for Architecture and the Urban Environment will
unite the work of a number of architectural organizations inspired
by the prince but which currently operate independently. Those
include an architecture school and a trust which acquires and
restores historic buildings.
	   The new setup is designed to reinvigorate the prince's Institute
of Architecture, which went through an unsettled period when its
glossy magazine, Perspectives on Architecture, folded in January.
	   ``My new foundation will be modern, but not modernist,'' Prince
Charles said, setting out his thoughts in the latest edition of The
Spectator magazine. ``Its values and culture will respect
traditional techniques in the disciplines of architecture, design
and the building arts, but will also encourage innovation and
utterly modern applications of these skills.''
	   Charles ignited a public debate in 1984 when he described a
proposed extension to London's National Gallery as a ``monstrous
carbuncle on the face of a well-loved friend.''
	   He has continued to criticize architects who produce buildings
that he considers ugly or inappropriate.
	   Asked if the foundation represented a modernist takeover of the
prince's original ideas, the prince's spokesman, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity said: ``Not at all. The prince's
views on architecture and the urban environment are wider than is
properly interpreted. He welcomes contemporary work where it
reflects the surrounding environment.''

African elephant pregnant from artificial insemination
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KANSAS CITY, Missouri (AP) _ Talk about long-distance
relationships.
	   Two African elephants living 500 miles (800 kilometers) away
from each other, one in Indianapolis and the other in Kansas City,
are creating a baby elephant through artificial insemination.
	   It is the first time anywhere that an African elephant has been
artificially inseminated, zoo officials said. A zoo in Springfield,
Missouri, recently announced the first successful artificial
insemination of an Asian elephant.
	   An ultrasound has confirmed that Kubwa, the Indianapolis zoo's
22-year-old virgin cow, is 9 weeks pregnant, zoo officials said
July 28.
	   ``This may be one of the most significant conservation steps for
African elephants in this century,'' said Kansas City Zoo director
Mark Wourms.
	   The Kansas City Zoo has been collecting semen regularly for the
past two years from a 20-year-old bull named Dale, then
express-shipping it to Indianapolis, where zookeepers implant the
semen in their female elephants.
	   It is the only zoo in the world to regularly, manually collect
semen from an African bull, using a technique developed in Germany.
The zoo also is working with the Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha,
Nebraska, to develop ways to freeze elephant semen so genetic
material can be preserved indefinitely.
	   There are only 12 bull African elephants in accredited zoos in
North America, two of which are in Kansas City. And many zoos with
female African elephants don't have easy access to bulls for
breeding.
	   Artificial insemination will allow conservationists more
flexibility in managing the gene pool _ both in zoos and in Africa,
Wourms said.
	    &UR; ___
 &UR; Ecologists tally few species as proxies for the rest in the jungle
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ One of the biggest obstacles facing ecologists
trying to conserve tropical biodiversity is the rain forest itself.
	   So many trees, ferns, moths, birds, ants and monkeys in one
place, and so little time.
	   British researchers working in Africa report in the July 30
issue of the journal Nature that they established a reliable
shorthand method of counting the richness of species in a tropical
forest.
	   The method is commonly used in studies on plains and savannahs,
but those are more open, less diverse ecosystems.
	   The tropical researchers surveyed key groups _ birds and
butterflies, for example _ that share similar habitats. These
creatures serve as proxies for the total number of species in that
area, in some cases as many as 2,500 species.
	   So if the butterfly and bird populations appear plentiful and
healthy, scientists said they can assume the biodiversity of the
entire forest is high.
	   Picking species to count at random, or trying to count
everything within a forest parcel was less efficient and resulted
in species that were overlooked or missed by the counters, they
said.
	   The method helps researchers more rapidly identify biologically
rich areas that should be preserved or threatened forests that
require immediate attention.
	   ``Some groups, by themselves, can reliably indicate the overall
conservation importance of a forest,'' reported Andrew Balmford of
the University of Sheffield. ``Priority-setting surveys could be
carried out more cheaply, without compromising their value.''
	   The approach also can be used from site to site, allowing
scientists to more easily compare widely separated forests.
	   Over a five-year period, the researchers surveyed 50 forests
scattered across Uganda. Within its borders, it contains both East
African savannahs and central African rain forests. Consequently,
the variety and density of species are perhaps the highest in
Africa.

<TEXT>
	   HIROSHIMA, Japan (AP) _ Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi used the
53rd anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima on Thursday to
urge India and Pakistan to stop their nuclear weapons testing
programs.
	   ``It is very regrettable that both India and Pakistan carried
out nuclear tests in May,'' said Obuchi, who took office last month
and appeared for the first time at the time-honored and solemn
annual ceremony of the world's first atomic attack.
	   Speaking to tens of thousands of people in Hiroshima _ including
the Indian and Pakistani ambassadors _ Obuchi said the Japanese
government was strongly urging both countries to immediately stop
nuclear testing, to unconditionally sign the comprehensive test ban
treaty, and to halt development of nuclear weapons and the missiles
that carry them.
	   India and Pakistan have come under intense international
criticism _ including the imposition of sanctions _ since carrying
out their nuclear tests, raising fears that international efforts
to reign in nuclear proliferation could be seriously damaged.
	   Ceremonies marking the anniversary of the U.S. bombing of
Hiroshima began with the offering of flowers at its Peace Park,
followed by a moment of silent prayer at 8:15 a.m. _ the exact
moment the bomb exploded above the city on Aug. 6, 1945.
	   The summer weather Thursday was hot with hazy skies. As in most
years, the moment of silence was broken only by the ringing of a
Buddhist bell and the constant chirping of cicadas.
	   Many among the estimated crowd of 50,000 clasped their hands in
prayer. Others held Buddhist prayer beads. But some passersby near
the park continued on their way to work as the bells tolled.
	   Hiroshima for the first time invited ambassadors to Japan from
the five major nuclear powers _ the United States, Britain, China,
France and Russia - as well as those from India and Pakistan, to
attend Thursday's ceremony.
	   But only India's Sidharth Singh and Pakistan's Touqir Hussain
attended, said Mayumi Tochino of the Hiroshima city hall.
	   Anti-nuclear peace marches or rallies also were scheduled later
in the day in India and Pakistan.
	   Addressing the crowd in Hiroshima, Mayor Takashi Hiraoka said
the nuclear tests by those two countries raised tensions in South
Asia and shook the foundation of the world's non-nuclear
proliferation movement.
	   ``The people in Hiroshima feel a strong rage against the nuclear
tests by the two nations, and worry about inducing a chain reaction
of nuclear competition,'' Hiraoka said.
	   About 140,000 people were killed by Hiroshima's atomic bombing
as well as the firestorm and radiation that ensued in the western
city that was a major military center during World War II.
	   Three days after the Hiroshima attack, the United States dropped
a second atom bomb on Nagasaki, located on Japan's southern main
island of Kyushu, killing 70,000 people. Japan surrendered
unconditionally on Aug. 15, 1945.
	   Like the rest of Japan, Hiroshima rebuilt after the war _ except
for the wreckage of one building left on display to remind visitors
of the massive destruction. Hiroshima, 690 kilometers (425 miles)
southwest of Tokyo, is now a thriving commercial center of 1.1
million people.
	   Today, many Japanese believe the atomic bombings of the two
cities were unjustified, despite Japan's war of aggression. But
U.S. wartime leaders defended the bombings as the only alternative

 &UR; Eds: LEADS with nine grafs to UPDATE 2nd item with Amezcua pleading
 &UR; Brazil moves to enforce laws against the destruction of the
Atlantic forest &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's Environmental Protection
Agency launched a five-week-long operation early Wednesday aimed at
enforcing laws against the destruction of the Atlantic forest.
	   The operation will involve 130 agents working in 22 teams that
will circulate through the remaining forest searching for irregular
activity throughout Rio de Janeiro state, said Manoel Magalhaes de
Mello Neto, enforcement director for the Environmental Protection
Agency.
	   ``Those who are caught destroying the rainforest can be
sentenced to between three and five years in jail,'' said Mello who
blames farmers opening up forested areas for agriculture and the
illegal extraction of hearts of palm for much of the destruction.
	   Rio de Janeiro is the state that lost the most forested area in
recent years with about 337,000 acres (134,000 hectares) destroyed
between 1990 and 1995.
	   The Atlantic forest once blanketed Brazil's 4,500-mile eastern
coast, today only 3 percent of its original area remains.
	   Between 1990 and 1995, the Atlantic forest lost 1,207,608 acres
(483,043 hectares) according to the National Space Research
Institute.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A lawyer for Jose de Jesus Amezcua, the
alleged head of Mexico's largest methamphetamine smuggling ring,
said Wednesday he will fight the U.S. extradition request that
resulted in his client's latest arrest.
	   Amezcua himself made an initial appearance before a judge on the
extradition issue Wednesday at a Mexico City prison. He said he had
lived 15 years in the United States, but called claims he had
committed crimes there ``an invention.''

Torrential rain hits South Korea; more death reported

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Torrential rains triggered floods and
landslides in Seoul and surrounding provinces Thursday, killing at
least 11 people and submerging thousands of homes.
	   Disaster relief headquarters urged 200,000 people in low-lying
districts of the capital to evacuate as tributaries to the Han
River bisecting the city threatened to overflow.
	   Suburbs north and west of Seoul were submerged in waist-deep
water. Rescuers used rubber boats to help move citizens to higher
ground. A satellite city north of Seoul was completely cut off,
with roads swept away, a subway line flooded and telephone poles
downed.
	   Four people were killed when a flash flood engulfed homes along
a valley in Uijongbu north of Seoul. A 49-year-old woman was
electrocuted in a nearby city. A 56-year-old woman was killed in a
landslide.
	   Five people were missing after a restaurant in an amusement park
north of Seoul collapsed under a landslide. Six others were
injured.
	   Up to 61 centimeters (24 inches) of rain poured down in Seoul
and its suburbs between late Wednesday and Thursday morning,
submerging 5,800 homes and other buildings and leaving at least
3,000 people homeless.
	   With weather forecasters predicting more rains, long lines of
people trekked along railway lines to higher ground. Large
stretches of green rice fields disappeared under brown flood water.
	   In Seoul, subway service was disrupted during busy commuting
hours when water submerged tracks.
	   President Kim Dae-jung ordered the military to dispatch soldiers
and equipment to step up relief efforts.
	   A front spreading east from China has been dumping rain on South
Korea since last weekend, first in the south and then in the north.
Flash floods turned streams and ravines in a national park in the
southern part of the nation into raging torrents over the weekend,
leaving 62 people dead and 32 missing.
	   On Wednesday night, a Korean Air passenger plane skidded off a
rain-slicked runway while landing at Seoul's Kimpo International
Airport, injuring 22 people.
	   The flight, carrying 397 passengers from Tokyo's Narita airport,
bounced and skidded before coming to a halt in a meadow.
	   Six of those injured were Japanese and the rest were South
Korean.

Decade after bloody uprising, Myanmar's military retains power

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Anger smolders at home and
international criticism runs hot, but Myanmar's generals show no
signs of easing the iron grip they have held since crushing a
democracy movement 10 years ago.
	   Since the summer of 1988, when thousands of protesters faced
bayonets and bullets in Myanmar, dictatorial regimes from eastern
Europe to Southeast Asia have fallen to democratic demands.
	   But after 36 years in control, Myanmar's junta is proving a
durable institution, having outlasted Suharto's authoritarian
regime in Indonesia and the era of military coups in neighboring
Thailand.
	   An exiled rebel leader, Aung Naing Oo, sees two opposing fears
working to keep Myanmar quiet. ``People are afraid of imprisonment,
torture, loss of jobs if they rise up. And the military is afraid
of retribution if it loses control,'' he said.
	   Recent travelers from Yangon, the capital, say the general mood
is tense with the approach of key dates tied to the 1988 unrest,
such as Saturday _ the 10th anniversary of a nationwide protest
strike. Requests for visas by foreign journalists are being
rejected.
	   The small, but vocal band of open opponents to the junta is
ratcheting up the pressure.
	   Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the 1988 demonstrations and
winner of the Nobel Peace Prize for her pro-democracy work, has set
Aug. 21 as the deadline for the generals to convene a national
assembly that was elected in 1990 but never recognized by the
military.
	   She also has vowed to make more trips outside Yangon despite
being stopped at a rural roadblock for six days in late July and
then forcibly returned to her home in the capital.
	   But despite strong international backing, Suu Kyi and her
followers _ their ranks withered by jailings _ have little
maneuvering room because it is doubtful the populace is ready to
again risk death in the streets.
	   ``I don't think anything will really change as long as the
military hangs together. They know that if they crack they are
finished,'' said Bertil Lintner, a Myanmar expert based in Bangkok.
``The opposition holds the moral high ground and public support but
that's about it. Change has to come from the top.''
	   Lintner notes that unlike other Asian countries where military
regimes were satisfied with just holding the political reins,
Myanmar's generals entrenched themselves in every sector and
ensured no other power centers developed to challenge their
authority.
	   As traditional hotbeds of dissent, Myanmar's universities have
been slammed shut whenever students merged in protest, despite the
damage this has caused to the country's development. In the latest
crackdown, colleges have been closed since December 1996.
	   After crushing the democracy movement, the generals stepped up
attacks on the other threat to its rule _ the welter of ethnic
minority groups that have fought for greater autonomy since
independence from Britain in 1948.
	   Truces have been signed with some groups. For others, like the
Karen and Karenni peoples, holding out has brought military attacks
in which civilians endure rape, murder, forced induction as porters
and burned villages, according to refugees and human rights groups.
	   The generals keep a firm hand on the economy, but unlike the
socialistic days before 1988, they have allowed a fair degree of
private enterprise and opening to the outside world.
	   With this has come the emergence of a fledgling middle class,
which from all evidence resents the military but is leery of
risking its material gains by agitating for political change.
	   Josef Silverstein, a longtime Myanmar scholar at Rutgers
University in New Jersey,thinks time is working against the regime.
	   ``They've got nothing going for them. They've got no money, no
friends and they can have an uprising on their hands at any time,''
he said. ``I don't think they'll fall on their swords. They'll
choke because they have no money.''
	   Analysts like Silverstein see the economy as the regime's
Achilles heel, recalling the uprising a decade ago was in large
part fueled by rice shortagesand other economic problems.
	   The final spark was a minor incident _ a brawl in a tea shop on
March 12, 1988, that led to student demonstrations, which were
later joined by ordinary citizens, monks, civil servants and even
some members of the military. They climaxed in a nationwide strike
Aug. 8, but a month later the military was back in total control
after killing hundreds, if not thousands, of protesters.
	   After some years of economic gains, Myanmar, which is still
called Burma by some, is again being wracked by soaring inflation,
a dropping currency, rice shortages and a lack of investment
because of the economic crisis that has hit Asia.
	   ``The Burmese authorities must learn that they can't go against
the will of the people forever,'' Suu Kyi said in a recent
interview.

Dollar higher in Tokyo, Japanese stocks mixed in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen in early
trading Thursday after an overnight rebound on Wall Street.
Japanese stock prices inched lower.
	   The dollar bought 144.63 yen, up 0.82 yen from late Wednesday in
Tokyo and above its late New York rate of 143.86 yen overnight.
	   Market players bought up dollars against the yen to cover short
positions after the U.S. currency's slide stopped overnight.
	   The dollar also got a boost following an overnight rise on Wall
Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average gained 59.47 points
Wednesday, snapping back from its 299-point loss Tuesday.
	   The dollar isn't likely to move much before a policy speech from
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on Friday, dealers said.
	   In the speech, investors and traders will be looking for
indications Japan's new government will move aggressively to get
its sagging economy back on track.
	   On the Tokyo stock exchange, share prices sank slightly in
morning trading as many investors held back to await Friday's
policy speech.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 21.33 points, or 0.13
percent, to close the morning session at 15,970.83 points. On
Wednesday, the Nikkei index closed down 31.42 points, or 0.20
percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 1.83 points, or 0.15 percent, to 1,233.95
points. The TOPIX closed down 1.17 points, or 0.09 percent, the day
before.
	   Investors would likely take their cue from the U.S. market over
the next few days, traders said.
	   ``It was a relief that the New York market stopped falling,''
said Masaaki Higashida, deputy general manager of the investment
information and services department at Nomura Securities.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.190 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.225
percent, driving its price up to 111.86 yen from 111.61 yen.

Diamondbacks beat Cubs; Marlins top Astros
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Sammy Sosa hit his 43rd homer but the Arizona
Diamondbacks sent Kerry Wood to his first loss at Wrigley Field,
beating the Chicago Cubs 10-7 Wednesday.
	   Andy Fox and Tony Batista homered for Arizona, and Andy Benes
(9-11) struck out nine in six innings. Gregg Olson pitched the
ninth for his 20th save in 23 chances.
	   Sosa pulled the Cubs to 5-3 in the third with a two-run homer,
pulling within two of Mark McGwire, the major league leader. Sosa,
1-for-4 with three RBIs, has six homers in his last 11 games.
	   Wood (11-6), who may skip his next start to rest a ``dead arm,''
gave up seven runs and nine hits in six innings.
 &UR; Marlins 5, Astros 3
	   In Miami, Jesus Sanchez (5-6) pitched seven innings on a
92-degree Fahrenheit (34-degree Celsius) afternoon, winning for
only the second time in his past 14 starts, and Derrek Lee hit a
three-run homer.
	   Matt Mantei completed the six-hitter by striking out the side in
the ninth for his sixth save.
	   Mike Hampton (9-6) allowed five runs _ four earned _ in five
innings. Houston second baseman Craig Biggio sat out the game,
ending his streak of 494 consecutive games, second only to Cal
Ripken among active players.
 &UR; Cardinals 5, Brewers 1
	   In Milwaukee, with Mark McGwire given the night off, backup
first baseman John Mabry homered in his first at-bat and singled to
break a fourth-inning tie.
	   Jeff Juden (7-11) allowed all five runs and five hits in 3 1-3
innings and is 1-6 with a 9.38 ERA in his last nine starts.
	   Kent Mercker (8-8) won his third consecutive decision, allowing
one run on four hits in seven innings.
 &UR; Reds 13, Braves 9
	   In Atlanta, Aaron Boone's two-run single broke a 9-all tie in
the ninth against Russ Springer (5-4) as Cincinnati got 16 hits,
rallying twice to stop Atlanta's three-game winning streak.
	   Dmitri Young matched a career high with four RBIs, hitting a
two-run homer in the first. Ryan Klesko and Javy Lopez hit
three-run homers for the Braves, who wasted 6-3 and 9-6 leads.
	   John Hudek (4-5) pitched a perfect eighth.
 &UR; Giants 6, Mets 4
	   In New York, rookie Russ Ortiz (1-1) allowed six hits, struck
out eight and walked four in eight-plus innings, gaining his first
major league victory. San Francisco overcame hitting into a triple
play.
	   After Bonds hit a two-run double off Bobby Jones (7-7) in the
fifth and crossed on Jeff Kent's single, J.T. Snow hit a hard
grounder to first baseman John Olerud, who threw to second for the
first out. Shortstop Rey Ordonez threw back to first for out No. 2,
and Olerud threw home to get a sliding Bonds. It was the Mets'
first triple play since June 6, 1989, at Chicago.
	   Robb Nen got three outs for his 29th save.
 &UR; Rockies 6, Pirates 2
	   In Pittsburgh, Jamey Wright (6-10) pitched a five-hitter for his
first complete game of the season and hit his first career homer.
He had been 0-4 with a 7.17 ERA in nine starts since June 13.
	   Wright, batting .189 at the time, also finished off a four-run
fifth inning against Francisco Cordova (9-10) with a two-run homer
that followed Jeff Reed's two-run double.
 &UR; Expos 5, Dodgers 1
	   In Montreal, Carl Pavano (4-5) allowed six hits in six shutout
innings and Scott Livingstone hit a two-run double in the first as
Montreal won its third straight. Ugueth Urbina got four outs for
his 25th save.
	   Wilton Guerrero, obtained from the Dodgers last Friday, scored
on Livingstone's first-inning double off Darren Dreifort (6-10) and
on his brother Vladimir's infield single in the sixth. Derrick May
homered against Mike Judd leading off the eighth.

Thai cable operator appeases angry customers with sports channels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ After receiving more than a quarter
million complaint calls, Thailand's sole cable television operator
said it will restore two sports channels to subscribers free of
charge until the end of August, the Bangkok Post reported Thursday.
	   The stations carry English Premier League and other European
soccer league broadcasts which are extremely popular with Thais,
particularly gamblers.
	   United Broadcasting Corporation was inundated with calls when at
the end of July they stopped showing the channels to basic
subscribers and demanded an additional fee to receive them.
	   ``No company in the world can handle that many phone calls,''
UBC Chief Operating Officer Neville Meijers was quoted as saying in
the Post.
	   Viewers will still have to pay an additional fee if they want
the sports channels after August.
	   UBC was formed when two cable operators, International
Broadcasting Corp. and United Television, merged two months ago.

Indians edge Angels; Orioles rout Tigers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANAHEIM, California (AP) _ Manny Ramirez hit a two-run homer in
the ninth inning and the Cleveland Indians beat the Anaheim Angels
6-5 Wednesday to stop a five-game losing streak.
	   After Jim Thome's one-out double, Ramirez connected off Troy
Percival (2-5) for his 27th homer.
	   Paul Shuey (4-1) allowed one run and two hits in two innings.
After Mike Jackson allowed Anaheim to put runners on first and
third with two outs, Paul Assenmacher walked Jim Edmonds.
Assenmacher then got Dave Hollins to hit a game-ending popup for
his first save since last Sept. 19.
 &UR; Orioles 6, Tigers 1
	   In Baltimore, Juan Guzman (7-12) pitched seven innings of
four-hit ball in his Orioles debut and Rafael Palmeiro hit his
fifth career grand slam as Baltimore completed a two-game sweep and
finished the season series 10-1. The Orioles are 20-5 since the
All-Star break.
	   Palmeiro's 34th homer of the season, a two-out shot to center
off Sean Runyan, made it 6-1 in the eighth. All the runs were
unearned, courtesy of an error by shortstop Damion Easley.
	   Justin Thompson (9-9) lost for the first time in seven starts
since June 28, allowing two runs, four hits and a career-high six
walks in 5 2-3 innings.
 &UR; Devil Rays 7, White Sox 3 &QC; 
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, Fred McGriff homered to begin a
six-run, eighth-inning rally that carried Tampa Bay over
error-plagued Chicago.
	   McGriff began the eighth with his 12th homer to tie the score
2-2 and finished the expansion team's most productive inning of the
season with an RBI single.
	   In between, the White Sox committed two of their five errors to
pave the way for five unearned runs off relievers Bob Howry (0-2)
and Chad Bradford.
	   In addition to McGriff's two RBIs in the eighth, Tampa Bay
scored on Quinton McCracken's two-run single, Bradford's
bases-loaded walk to Kevin Stocker and shortstop Mike Caruso's
throwing error.
	   Roberto Hernandez (2-4) pitched 1 1-3 innings in relief of Julio
Santana to get the victory. He allowed one hit, Albert Belle's 35th
homer in the ninth.
 &UR; Royals 4, Twins 3 &QC; 
	   In Minneapolis, Sal Fasano broke out of a slump with a three-run
homer and Jose Offerman hit a solo shot and extended his hitting
streak to 24 games as Kansas City beat Minnesota.
	   Fasano was hitless in 12 at-bats and hitting .114 over 15 games
until he homered to left off Frank Rodriguez with two outs in the
fifth inning. That helped Kansas City win for the fifth time in six
games and move within a half-game of the Twins for second place in
the AL Central.
	   Offerman singled in the sixth to tie Boston's Nomar Garciaparra
for the second-longest hitting streak in the majors this season.
Anaheim's Garret Anderson has the longest streak this year at 28
games.
	   Offerman led off the ninth with a 377-foot drive to right field
for his fifth homer of the season, tying his career high.
	   Terry Steinbach hit a two-run homer for the Twins, who have lost
four straight and five of six.

Cambodia's ruling party says victory at polls a victory for nation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian leader Hun Sen's political
party said Thursday that its victory at the polls was a triumph for
the nation and democracy, and urged the opposition to join the new
government.
	   Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party emerged as the clear
winner as the first complete results from last week's parliamentary
election were announced Wednesday.
	   Pending recounts of some votes, the party appeared to have won a
slight majority in the 122-seat National Assembly but not the
two-thirds majority needed to form a government on its own.
	   ``This victory is not a victory exclusively for the CPP but is
also of the entire nation which is on its path of liberal
democracy,'' the party said, promising to work hard to build up the
economy and social development.
	   A coalition with other parties which won seats in the elections
is the ``best way to guarantee national stability and to build
trust among the Cambodian people toward the government,'' it said
in its three-page statement.
	   Promising to bring peace and stability to Cambodia after winning
the election, the ruling party said it was confident the country
was moving in the right direction.
	   ``The CPP would like to appeal to all compatriots of all walks
of life throughout the nation and outside the country, to remain
calm and be united ... in order to build a prosperous future.''
	   The election on July 26 came one year after Hun Sen ousted
Prince Norodom Ranariddh as his co-prime minister in a violent coup
d'etat, shattering a dual premiership formed after U.N.-sponsored
polls in 1993.
	   Hun Sen hoped that new election would restore his legitimacy in
the eyes of the international community and foreign aid lost after
his takeover.
	   His opponents charge the polls were rigged in his favor and are
challenging the results, alleging widespread irregularities in the
counting of ballots.
	   Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party is projected to take 43
parliamentary seats according to Wednesday's preliminary tally, and
its ally the Sam Rainsy Party was expected to take 15 seats.

Sampras wins in post-Wimbledon return
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Agassi quotes in news grafs 7-8 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Pete Sampras, playing for the first time since
his Wimbledon triumph, beat Italy's Gianluca Pozzi 6-1, 6-2 on
Wednesday to advance to the third round of the du Maurier Open.
	   Sampras, who had minor foot surgery July 15, will cede his No. 1
ranking to Chile's Marcelo Rios if he loses in Toronto. Sampras is
on course for a quarterfinal match with Andre Agassi, the eighth
seed who advanced Wednesday night.
	   ``For my first match in a month and first on hardcourt in over
three months, it was a match where I could see the ball very well
playing someone who doesn't have a huge serve,'' Sampras said.
	   ``It gave me some time to get into a rhythm out there and feel
the surroundings and the court speed. ... I was pretty pleased with
how I played.''
	   Sampras is appearing in this event for the first time since
1990, when he lost in the semifinals.
	   The flamboyant Agassi kept pace, downing France's Guillaume
Raoux 6-4, 7-5 in a hard-hitting baseline battle before an
energetic center court gathering of 10,000 spectators. Agassi
recorded his 12th straight win in style _ with an ace _ and
continued his amazing 1998 run. The 28-year-old American has won
four tournaments this year _ including his last two _ and has
jumped 99 spots in the rankings to No. 11.
	   ``I realized I had to go back to square one, I really had to get
back into shape and go play some Challengers and start over,''
Agassi said. ``If I didn't turn things around it (the end) was at
hand.
	   ``The tough part was to be honest about where I was, then
understand where it was I wanted to go and then to set the course
accordingly.''
	   Agassi has dominated this event, winning it three times. He
improved his career record to 24-4 and is an amazing 13-1 in
Toronto.
	   In other matches, No. 3 seed Patrick Rafter of Australia
defeated Neville Godwin of South Africa 7-5, 6-3; No. 4 Yevgeny
Kafelnikov of Russia downed Todd Martin 6-2, 6-3; and No. 7 Tim
Henman of England outlasted Argentina's Guillermo Canas 3-6, 7-6
(7-5), 6-2.
	   Other seeds advancing were: No. 9 Alberto Costa of Spain, No. 10
Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia and No. 14 Mark Philippoussis of
Australia. No. 15 Fabrice Santoro of France lost 7-6 (10-8), 6-2 to
Germany's Tommy Haas.
	   Sampras is bidding to become the only player in ATP history to
be No. 1 six straight years. He shares the mark of five straight
with Jimmy Connors.
	   ``One of my main goals this year was to try to break the
record,'' Sampras said. ``Obviously, I didn't do myself any favors
with the first four months of the year when I wasn't playing that
well.''
	   Should Sampras win the upcoming U.S. Open, he'll tie Roy
Emerson's record of 12 career Grand Slam tournament titles.
	   ``When it's over, it's over, and I'll look back and appreciate
what I've done,'' he said.
	   Rod Laver and Bjorn Borg won 11 Grand Slam tournaments each.
Laver, Sampras' boyhood idol, is recovering from a stroke.
	   ``I was fortunate enough to have seen Rod play when he was in
his prime,'' Sampras said. ``I've thought about him quite a bit
over the past couple of weeks after his stroke, and I certainly
hope I can get a chance to talk to him.''

Torrential rain hits South Korea; more deaths reported
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with detail throughout
 &UR; AP Photos
 &UR; By SANG-HUN CHOE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Torrential rains triggered floods and
landslides in Seoul and surrounding provinces Thursday, killing at
least 15 people, leaving at least 25 missing and submerging
thousands of homes.
	   Disaster relief headquarters urged 200,000 people in low-lying
districts of the capital to evacuate as tributaries to the Han
River bisecting the city threatened to overflow.
	   Suburbs north and west of Seoul were submerged in waist-deep
water. Rescuers used rubber boats to help move citizens to higher
ground. A satellite city north of Seoul was completely cut off,
with roads swept away, a subway line flooded and telephone poles
downed.
	   Four people were killed when a restaurant in an amusement park
north of Seoul collapsed under a mudslide.
	   Four others were killed when a flash flood engulfed homes along
a valley in Uijongbu north of Seoul. A 49-year-old woman was
electrocuted in a nearby city. A 56-year-old woman was killed in a
landslide.
	   Firefighter Chan Mu-won, 28, was found dead six hours after he
was swept away by floodwaters while saving two people. MBC-TV
reported at least five soldiers were missing in a mudslide, but the
Defense Ministry could not immediately confirmed the report.
	   Up to 61 centimeters (24 inches) of rain poured down in Seoul
and its suburbs between late Wednesday and Thursday morning,
submerging 5,800 homes and other buildings and leaving at least
3,000 people homeless.
	   The government's Disaster Relief Headquarters said 25 people
were missing, but news reports put the figure up to 40.
	   With weather forecasters predicting more rain, long lines of
people trekked along railway lines to higher ground. Large
stretches of green rice fields disappeared under brown flood water.
	   ``We are worried about the water levels in the Han River. But
the imminent danger seems to be subsiding because water levels in
its tributaries are receding,'' said Chan Jong-hwan, a relief
organizer.
	   In Seoul, subway service was disrupted during busy commuting
hours when water submerged tracks.
	   President Kim Dae-jung ordered the military to dispatch soldiers
and equipment to step up relief efforts.
	   The downpours mostly affected Seoul and regions near the North
Korean border, 60 kilometers (37 miles) north of the capital.
Weather officials could not immediately tell how much rain fell in
North Korea, where famine is spreading after years of floods,
droughts and other bad weather.
	   A front spreading east from China has been dumping rain on South
Korea since last weekend, first in the south and then in the north.
Flash floods turned streams and ravines in a national park in the
southern part of the nation into raging torrents over the weekend,
leaving 64 people dead and 32 missing.
	   On Wednesday night, a Korean Air passenger plane skidded off a
rain-slicked runway while landing at Seoul's Kimpo International
Airport, injuring 22 people.
	   The flight, carrying 397 passengers from Tokyo's Narita airport,
bounced and skidded before coming to a halt in a meadow. One of the
airport's two runways remained closed Thursday, forcing delays in
landings.
	   Six of those injured were Japanese and the rest were South
Korean.

Sugiyama upsets Graf at Toshiba Classic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Martinez loss; will be UPDATED with Seles night
match &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CARLSBAD, California (AP) _ Japan's Ai Sugiyama overcame cramps
and a late-match deficit to stun former world No. 1 Steffi Graf
6-4, 1-6, 7-5 Wednesday in the dlrs 450,000 Toshiba Tennis Classic.
	   Sugiyama, ranked 17th in the world, called for an injury timeout
after hitting a backhand winner that set up her fourth match point
in the final game of the third set. Sugiyama, suffering from cramps
in her right hamstring and right quadriceps, was treated by a WTA
Tour trainer for nearly three minutes before closing out the
victory.
	   Calling it the ``best match'' of her career, Sugiyama rebounded
from third-set deficits of 2-0 and 5-4 with Graf serving and
needing just two points to win the second-round match.
	   ``This time I played my best tennis,'' said Sugiyama, comparing
her play with her only other meeting with Graf, earlier this year
at Indian Wells. Graf cruised to a 6-0, 6-1 victory.
	   Graf, a four-time winner here, most recently in 1994, suffered
her first loss in the event in 22 matches.
	   ``It's obviously very disappointing,'' she said. ``I played
really well last night and I was going for my shots. I didn't
really do that today from the beginning.''
	   Graf returned to the tour in February after an eight-month
absence because of various injuries. Her world ranking has dropped
to No. 44, although she was seeded sixth here.
	   In other second-round matches, top-seeded Martina Hingis scored
a 6-3, 6-2 win over Natasha Zvereva of Belarus; unseeded Mary
Pierce of France upset No. 5 Conchita Martinez of Spain 6-7 (1-7),
6-2, 6-3, and South Africa's Joannette Kruger beat former French
Open champion Iva Majoli 6-3, 7-6 (7-1).
	   The momentum of the Graf-Sugiyama match changed repeatedly.
Sugiyama won the first set when she scored the only service break
in the ninth game.
	   It appeared Graf had regained control when she took a
competitive second set and won the first two games of the third.
But Sugiyama surprisingly reeled off four consecutive games,
breaking Graf's serve twice as she allowed her German counterpart
just one point in the two games.
	   Graf took a 5-4 lead on her third break of the set and was
serving for the match. Just two points away from victory, however,
Graf failed to close out the win as Sugiyama broke her serve again
to tie the match.
	   Sugiyama went ahead 6-5 before Graf staved off three match
points in the final game. Graf had two chances to tie the match and
send it into a tiebreak, but failed each time.
	   Following Sugiyama's injury timeout, Graf hit a forehand into
the net to end the match.
	   ``She played some amazing shots when it was important,'' Graf
said. ``She really went after everything.''
	   The Hingis-Zvereva score did not reflect the tight nature of the
match.
	   ``Any time I played her,'' Hingis said, ``she gives me a hard
time. ``She's a very smart player, very clever.''
	   Hingis hadn't played in a tournament since losing in the
semifinals of Wimbledon July 2. But the Swiss teen-ager responded
each time Zvereva challenged.
	   Hingis, whose only action since Wimbledon came in a Fed Cup
match in late July, said she was glad to face Zvereva in her first
match of the tournament.
	   ``I'm quite happy that I played Zvereva because she gives you a
lot of time to prepare yourself. She's not one of the big hitters
... You just get the feel of the court.''

	   In Arlington, Texas, Mike Simms' pinch-hit RBI single won the
game in the ninth inning after Juan Gonzalez tied it with a solo
shot as Texas won its fourth straight.
	   With the Rangers trailing 3-2, Gonzalez led off the ninth with
his 32nd homer, a towering blast to left off Randy Myers (3-4).
Gonzalez, who returned after missing six games with a strained
hamstring, raised his major-league leading RBI total to 117.
	   Myers walked two batters and got an out before Simms hit a
single down the left-field line.
	   Felipe Crespo's two-out RBI single off John Wetteland in the top
of the ninth gave Toronto a 3-2 lead, but Wetteland (3-1) got the
victory after the Rangers rallied to win.
