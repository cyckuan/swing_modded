<P>
CHANGCHUN, Jilin Province, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Enjoying a
perennial big hit in the winter sports, Olympic silver medallist
Ye Qiaobo delighted the country winter sports fans with her
musician genius as the China's Ninth National Winter Games opened
here Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Ye, the first Chinese with an Olympic podium finish in the
Alberville Winter Olympics in 1992, sung Soul of Ice on the ice
where she was more acquaintanded with as a speed skater but not
as a singer.
</P>
<P>
She was joined by a handful of singers, like Wei Wei, Yin
Xiumei and Cai Guoqing in the versicolour and glistering ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old Ye, as Asia's first world all-round winner,
triumphed in the 1992-93 season with a historical Grand Slam
sweep in the world championships, plus two silvers and one bronze
in the Olympics before she retired after the Lillehammer Winter
Olympics in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"This is a new way to express my bless and hope to China's
skating," said Ye, in a brown military suit on a sledge when she
was singing.
</P>
<P>
Far away at the North Big Lake skiing base in Jilin city,
another Olympic silver medalist stole the limelight of the
competition before the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Xu Nannan, silver medal winner of the women's free style
aerial skiing jumping in the Nagano Olympics last February, led
Changchun team for the first gold medal of the games in the
women's team free style skiing event.
</P>
<P>
Other two gold medals on Sunday went to the Army's veteran
Chen Guoguang, who beat race favorite Xu Zhongcheng, silver
medalist in last Asian Winter Games, in the men's 30-kilometer
cross-country, and Baishan's Luan Zhengrong, who took the women's
15-kilometer cross-country gold without surprise.
</P>
<P>
Lucky audience could also watch Hong Kong delegation who sent
for the first time an ice hockey team and five other athletes for
figure skating and short track speed skating.
</P>
<P>
In the pre-opening ceremony ice hockey tournament, Hong Kong
lost all its four games, but was never bothered by the results.
</P>
<P>
"We're here to learn, not to win medals," said team leader Li
Guangjing. "Our aim is to promote the winter sports in the south
part of the country, like Guangdong, Fujian and Yunnan."
</P>
<P>
The Games will be concluded on January 20 with 64 golds in the
nine sports.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Have Right to Establish State: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians have the
right to establish their own state in the territories, Japanese
Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura said in Ramallah on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after his meeting with Yasser Arafat,
President of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), Komura
said that the Japanese government does not object the
Palestinians to establish their independent state in the
territories because they have the right to do so, but this matter
is better to be solved through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese government supports the Palestinians' aspiration
for an independent state because the Palestinians have the right
to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent
statehood," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he added that the permanent issues such as the
establishment of a Palestinian state should be determined through
negotiations and therefore it is difficult for Japan to decide
its position toward this issue now.
</P>
<P>
He said his government is deeply concerned about Israel's
freezing of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Komura signed with Arafat an aid package
of 20 million U.S. dollars that Japan decided to provide to the
PNA.
</P>
<P>
Komura arrived in Ramallah from Jordan to have talks with
Arafat on the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and his Israeli counterpart Ariel Sharon on Monday in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Komura has also visited Egypt, Lebanon and Syria during his
current Mideast tour.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Presses Hard on Ice Hockey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, Jilin Province, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Debutant
Hong Kong delegation has imposed undeniable impact in the Ninth
National Winter Games which opened Saturday night, though its
men's ice hockey team lost all four games in the pre-opening
ceremony competition.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong struggled in vain for a morale-boosting opener
against Jiamusi as the team was crashed 6-1 on Tuesday, and could
not catch up with the pace of Zhuhai to surrender another
lope-sided match 6-2 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong also lost to Qiqiha'er on 4-3 and Jilin 8-6 in the
flowing two days.
</P>
<P>
The new comer, however, never left the pitch empty-handed as
it managed to score every time against all the opponents in its
first entry of the national winter games. The team has set up a
hope to explore a maiden area in China's southern provinces where
the warm winter can not freeze natural ice for the sports.
</P>
<P>
China's national ice hockey squad acquires players mostly from
Heilongjiang and Jilin, both in the northeast of China.
</P>
<P>
Zhuhai Landi accompanied Hong Kong as the other ice hockey
team from southern China, but its players are actually the entire
squad of the Qiqiha'er second-team.
</P>
<P>
"There is no natural ice arena in Hong Kong, so we don't
expect too much from this veteran team. We're learning here, not
for the medals," said Li Guangjing, Hong Kong ice hockey team
leader, after he arrived here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
But the pressure was not released by Li's remarks as Hong
Kong's another younger team, a much better one, which is training
in Canada and could not fly back for the competition, is the real
threat with more mystery for the next edition of the event.
</P>
<P>
Returning to the People's Republic of China in 1997 and
attending the National Eighth Games in October of 1997, Hong Kong
also sent three athletes to compete in the short track speed
skating and two for the figure skating in the ten-day national
winter games.
</P>
<P>
About 4,000 athletes from 35 cities and areas are competing in
the games featuring 62 events in nine sports of speed skating,
shore track speed skating, figure skating, ice hockey, downhill,
cross-country skiing, ski jumping and the combined.

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges Release of Serb Hostages in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia Sunday called for the
immediate release of hostages held by Albanian rebels in the
Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Moscow is demanding the immediate and unconditional release by
Albanian guerrillas of all the hostages they have seized," the
Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The appeal came after reports that Yugoslav federal forces were
moving to rescue the eight Serb policemen held by the Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA).
</P>
<P>
"We are appealing to the authorities of the Union Republic of
Yugoslavia and Serbia to show a maximum of restraint in this
difficult situation, which they have so far been able to manifest
despite provocations," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It denounced the KLA's attack on the military convoy and the
seizure of eight Yugoslav servicemen near the town of Kosovska
Mitrovica Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The event is a crying act of terror," the statement said. "It
is a challenge to the international community, a direct violation
of obligations resulting from the resolutions of the U.N. Security
Council."

<P>
ANKARA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A private medical center
providing radiotherapy treatment could be responsible for two
scrap dealers' being exposed to radiation in Istanbul, Turkey's
health minister said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Anatolia News Agency quoted Halil Ibrahim Ozsoy as saying
that "if the responsible side was a medical center, we will take
necessary measures." But he did not specify.
</P>
<P>
Ilyas and Naki Ilgaz, the two brothers dealing in scrap trading
in a scrap warehouse in the Ikitelli district of Istanbul, went to
a private hospital Friday complaining about frequent nausea,
listlessness and dizziness.
</P>
<P>
The symptoms appeared after they were exposed to radiation from
a bar of cobalt-60 when they tried to cut through it to obtain
lead. The bar is supposed to be found among wastes from the
medical center.
</P>
<P>
The health minister put the total number of victims exposed to
the radiation at eight. The warehouse, with two tonnes of iron and
lead in stock had been sealed off.
</P>
<P>
Six Turkish people were detained in connection with the
incident and the owner of the company, which had brought the
radioactive block into Turkey from the U.S., is wanted by police.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Says Discussion with Mugabe A </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba Sunday described as a success his discussion with his
Zimbabwean counterpart Robert Mugabe on how to put an end to the
five-month conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Returning here Sunday afternoon from a brief visit to Zimbabwe,
Chiluba said he consulted Mugabe on the conflict in DRC. The two
heads of state are concerned over the escalation of the crisis and
are trying to seek a solution.
</P>
<P>
On whether the rebels fighting to topple Congolese President
Laurent Kabila would be allowed to attend the planned talks to be
held here next week, Chiluba can neither confirm nor deny this
possibility, but said all avenues are being pursued to ensure that
the conflict in the country is resolved.
</P>
<P>
He said among the issues he discussed with Mugabe is the
withdrawal of foreign troops and exchange of prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said he will continue to consult regional leaders ahead
of the peace meeting.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Harare, capital of Zimbabwe, on Sunday
morning, Chiluba said there is a positive development toward the
end to the crisis following Kabila's invitation extended to the
rebels for talks in Kinshasa, capital of the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Though the rebels have turned down the offer for dialog in
Kinshasa, a way and consensus has to be established over how they
could be incorporated in the Lusaka talks, said the Zambian
president, adding that the rebels are key to these talks.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday Chiluba held similar talks in Kigali with Rwandan
 President Pasteur Bizimungu and Vice-President Major General Paul
Kagame.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba's visits to the two countries is part of his
preparations for the long awaited peace talks on the war in DRC,
which should have been held here on December 8 of 1998 and now is
rescheduled for next week.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka regional summit on peace in the Congo has been
postponed three times because of Kabila's refusal to have direct
talks with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said last Thursday that now all the warring parties
have agreed to meet to iron out their differences.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda have been accused of backing the rebels in
the DRC while Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Chad have sent their
troops to the vast central African country to support Kabila.

<HEADLINE> Peace-Keeping Force to Fight Back S. Leone Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The West African peace-keeping
force ECOMOG seems to be preparing for a counter-attack against
the rebels holding the east and central parts of capital Freetown
with hundreds of reinforcements arriving in Sierra Leone Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that several hundred Nigerian troops had arrived
 overnight at the Lungi International Airport aboard a Boeing 747
as the rebels rejected the cease-fire agreement reached between
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah and rebel leader Foday Sankoh
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the ECOMOG force was quoted as saying Sunday,
"the troops are being taking up positions in the offensive mounted
against the rebels holding parts of Freetown", according to
reports reaching here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Residents in Freetown said there was a tense calm in the
battered capital early Sunday and there were no reports of
fighting overnight.
</P>
<P>
But there were signs Saturday of intensified fighting between
the Nigerian-led ECOMOG troops and the rebel force, and reports
said ECOMOG troops had taken some rebel-held areas.
</P>
<P>
Field Commander of the anti-government Revolutionary United
Front (RUF) Sam Bockarie insists that he will continue his
offensive against the ECOMOG force until the jailed rebel leader
Foday Sankoh is released while the Sierra Leone government says
that Sankoh could be freed if a cease-fire is established.
</P>
<P>
Bockarie has pledged to press his offensive against the Lungi
airport complex where President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah and senior

<HEADLINE> Iranian Government Cedes Authority on Non-Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Iranian cabinet has decided to
cede the policy-making authority on exports to a special council
in order to inject a new life to the country's stagnated non-oil
exports.
</P>
<P>
The High Council for Non-Oil Exports (HCNOE), instead of the
cabinet, will have the authority to make decisions on policies
concerning non-oil exports, public relations office of Iran's
Export Promotion Center announced on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
From now on, any decisions by the HCNOE will go into effect
without further cabinet approval, the Islamic Republic News
Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The decision to transfer the authority is aimed at speeding up
the decision and policy-making processes regarding non-oil
exports, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Iran's non-oil exports registered a 11.3 percent drop during
the first three quarters of the current Iranian calendar year (to
end on March 20) from the same period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Customs reported recently that the country only earned
2.086 billion U.S. dollars from non-oil exports during the nine
months while its imports stood at 11.4 billion dollars, which
also had a 11 percent decrease from the corresponding period last
year.
</P>
<P>
Iranian economists and experts termed the fluctuation of
policies and bureaucracy as the main hurdles on the way of Iran's
non-oil exports.

<HEADLINE> Israel Accused of Blocking Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official on
Sunday accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of
blocking the Middle East peace process by failing to implement the
signed peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa, head of the Political Department of the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Farouk Kaddoumi blamed
Israel for the current stalemate in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He denounced Netanyahu as a "racist" and "terrorist," saying
the Israeli leader is a person who "can not be trusted."
</P>
<P>
The Wye River accord signed between the Palestinians and Israel
last October was in fact shelved after Israel demanded the
Palestinians to collect illegal weapons, reduce police force, curb
incitements of violence and renounce the plan to declare
unilaterally an independent state next May.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have rejected the Israeli demands as new
conditions outside the Washington-brokered Wye River accord.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the two sides have virtually been
frozen after Israel decided to hold early general elections on May
17.
</P>
<P>
Kaddoumi called for a unified Arab stance to salvage the
Mideast peace process based on the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
He said that his talks with Moussa also dealt with the Iraqi
issue and the military strikes against the country by the United
States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The Arab nations are "keen on Iraq's territorial integrity," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched a four-day missile attack on Iraq
on December 16-19 in what the U.S. said a retaliation for Baghdad's
defiance of the United Nations weapons inspections.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Industrial Investments Fall by 48 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran's industrial investments
plunged 48 percent during the first eight months of this Iranian
year (to end on March 20) on a year-to-year basis, an Iranian
official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The investments for establishing new industrial units under the
coverage of the Industries Ministry during the period amounted to
11,175 billion rials (about 3.7 billion U.S. dollars), said Public
Relations Director of the ministry Mehdi Oyar-Hossein.
</P>
<P>
The ministry issued 4,240 licenses for building new industrial
units during the period, down 41 percent compared to those of the
same period last Iranian year, the Islamic Republic News Agency
(IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The issuance of licenses is supposed to be a yardstick to
measure people's inclination to invest in the industrial sector,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 108,134 new jobs were created during the
eight-month period, down 47 percent from the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
Iran's oil-dependent economy suffered a heavy blow last year as
oil prices plunged into a record low in 20 years. Experts said the
country's oil revenues would fall below 10 billion dollars in the
current Iranian year.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Journalist Condemned for Israel Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti journalist Bou
Yabes has been criticized by his colleagues and lawmakers for his
recent visit to Israel, still arch-foe of most Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's Journalist Association (KJA), of which Yabes is a
member, denounced in a statement Sunday the visit, which happened
last December, as "provocative to sentiments of the Muslims and
Arabs especially in Kuwait which is still at a state of war" with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The association said Yabes' visit was a "dangerous and
unprecedented harmful move against the Kuwait journalism which
rejects any form of connections with the Zionist enemy."
</P>
<P>
The association indicated that it would take proper action
against Yabes for his "irresponsible and rejected behavior."
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, some of Kuwait's parliament members described
Yabes as "a very silly person" and accused him of "selling his
country in return for money."
</P>
<P>
They urged the KJA to take swift action against Yabes, and
called for referring him to the state security authority so that
they "are able to determine the real aims and motives behind his
recent meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu."
</P>
<P>
London-based Arabic daily Al-Sharq Al-Awsat had recently
carried a photo of Yabis shaking hands with Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Yabes also reportedly interviewed Israeli President Ezer
Weizman and other high-ranking officials during the
visit.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Further Offer Transit Routes to Malawi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa assured Sunday that his country will continue to
offer ports, railways, roads and other facilities to land-locked
Malawi to transit goods.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa made the assurance as a friendly gesture to Malawian
President Bakili Muluzi, who arrived in Dar es Salaam Sunday for a
four-day state visit to Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased to offer you the shortest, most direct and most
reliable access to the sea, " Mkapa said at a state banquet in Dar
es Salaam in honor of the Malawian president.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said trade between the two countries has grown over the
past ten years. Bilateral trade volume in 1996 reached 16 million
U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
"These may seem to be small amounts to others, but to us they
are significant and even more importantly, they are moving in the
right direction, a movement we must encourage and facilitate," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian President also urged African countries to
intensify sub- regional and regional cooperation and integration
as it is a global trend.
</P>
<P>
Muluzi, accompanied by his wife Anne Muzuli, are scheduled to
tour the Dar es Salaam Port which handles his country's imports
and exports, meet Tanzanian business communities, and attend the
35th anniversary of Zanzibar Revolution during his official visit.

<P>
BAGHDAD, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf on Sunday slammed the U.S. and Britain
for committing a criminal aggression against Iraq on December
16-19.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held at the Ministry of Information,
Sahhaf also slammed the Saudi and Kuwaiti governments for their
participation in the aggression.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S.-British aggression and imposition of
no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq put the international
community and the region in a strange and dangerous position.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf wondered how the U.S. and Britain, two permanent
members of the U.N. Security council, can commit crimes of
aggression against a member state of the U.N. and at the same
time play the role of protectors of peace and security in the
world.
</P>
<P>
"This has cast a very dark shadow on the credibility and
reliability of the Security Council," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the region, it also creates very odd and dangerous
situation because those two aggressors are taking with them two
states in the region, namely Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, to
participate with them in this odd situation..." he added.
</P>
<P>
He said 492 cruise missiles launched during the U.S.-British
air raids were from Kuwaiti air spaces, 126 air sorties from
Kuwait and 97 air sorties from Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
"This shows that the Saudi and Kuwait governments have
participated directly and effectively in the aggression," Sahhaf
said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Holds Kuwait, Saudi Arabia for Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi National Assembly
(parliament) held the Kuwaiti and Saudi authorities responsible
for the material and human losses resulted from the recent
U.S.-British air strikes against the country.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly stressed in a resolution adopted Sunday
at the conclusion of its extraordinary session that Iraq would
preserve its rights for compensation for the damages.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait was the victim of Iraq's 1990 invasion and had thus been
willing to see President Saddam Hussein being bombed. Saudi
Arabia, which has a defense pact with the U.S., allowed its
territory to be used for attacks against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The assembly also unanimously decided to discuss and study what
it called "unjust" U.N. resolutions and measures which preceded
and followed the recent U.S.-British aggression against Iraq,
reported the Iraqi News Agency (INA).
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi parliament lauded the genuine national stands of the
Arab Parliamentary Union (APU) during its extraordinary meeting in
Amman on December 27 last year.
</P>
<P>
The 17-member APU, with the conspicuous absence of Kuwait,
Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar and Mauritania, adopted a resolution
condemning the U.S.-British attack against Iraq and calling for
lifting of U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The assembly called upon the Iraqi political leadership to urge
the Arab governments to abide by the resolutions of the APU and to
put them into force.
</P>
<P>
The extraordinary session of the Iraqi parliament was convened
on Saturday morning to discuss the U.S.-British air strikes on
Iraq and the Arab position toward it.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain air-raided Iraq on December 16-19 in
Operation Desert Fox to "punish Iraq's failure to cooperate fully
in U.N. weapons inspections.

<P>
CAIRO, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa is to pay a brief visit to Israel Monday.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters Sunday that he was invited to visit
Israel by former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres for the
annual gathering of the Peres Center for Peace, at which he will
deliver a speech on the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The peace process "is now crippled and stalled," the Egyptian
foreign minister said, holding Israel responsible for the current
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
During his brief stay in Israel, he may meet with some Israeli
officials on issues of common concern, Moussa said, adding that
preparations for a meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon have been made. But he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been frozen because of
Israel's demands for what the Palestinians denounced as conditions
that were not included in the Wye River accord signed between the
two sides last October.
</P>
<P>
The peace march came to a standstill also due to Israel's
decision to hold early general elections on May 17.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel in 1979, maintains a "cold peace" with the Jewish state due
to the slow pace of the peace process. The two countries witness
few exchanges of high-level visit recently.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania, China Expect Renewed Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister
Frederick Sumaye told visiting Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan Sunday that his country wishes to explore new forms of
economic cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Tang who arrived here in the morning from
Uganda, Sumaye said as a real and long-lasting friend of Tanzania,
China has devoted great efforts to Tanzania's basic economic
construction in almost every field since it's independence in
early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
"These projects, like the well-known 1,860-km Tanzania-Zambia
Railway built in mid 1970s, have played an very important role in
Tanzania's economic development," he said at his residence in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister said over the past few years, Tanzania and
China have tried to explore ways to revive the out-dated
cooperation projects.
</P>
<P>
"The Sino-Tanzanian Friendship Textile Company has been
successfully changed from a state-run factory into a joint venture
run by enterprises of both countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye suggested that this successful mode be used in other
Sino- Tanzanian cooperation in the fields of agriculture,
industry, hydraulics and others.
</P>
<P>
Tang, who is on the fourth leg of his African tour, said
Tanzania enjoys a very peaceful life which is vital for a rapid
economic development, in a sharp contrast with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Foreign Minister said China wishes to join Tanzania
in probing ways for development and prosperity which are based on
its basic national conditions and in the interest of its people.
</P>
<P>
"China and Tanzania can cooperate, for example, in the items
which are mutually complementary with a combination of Chinese
technology and equipment with Tanzania's vast natural resources
and manpower," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang, who has visited Egypt, Kenya, Uganda since the beginning
of this month, is expected to meet with Tanzanian Foreign Minister
Jakaya Kikwete and President Benjamin Mkapa on Monday for further
discussions.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement delivered upon his arrival at the Dar es
Salaam International Airport, Tang praised Tanzania's tremendous
contribution to the political liberation of the African continent,
and to that of southern Africa in particular.
</P>
<P>
"At present, it is playing important role in African, in
particular eastern and southern African affairs," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that to strengthen solidarity and cooperation with
African countries has always been an important component of
China's independent foreign policy of peace.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that this visit to Tanzania will reach the goal
of making more friends, steeping up consultation, enhancing mutual
 understanding, expanding common ground and pushing for
cooperation," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tang Jiaxuan is also scheduled to visit some Sino-Tanzanian
joint ventures on Tuesday before departing for his last African
stop in Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi FM Doubts Saudi Initiative of Lifting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf termed on Sunday the reported Saudi
initiative to lift U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq as
"contraversial and contradictory" with Saudi participation in the
U.S.-British air strikes and imposition of no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf said at a press conference that Iraq would welcome any
decision of the Arab countries to lift the sanctions imposed on
the country.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Saudi Arabia will make an initiative that
will aim to get U.N. sanctions lifted to export food and medicine
to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf stressed that the reasonable minimum steps that can be
taken by the Arab League member states "is to lift the sanctions
by a unilateral or by a group of Arab countries from their side
and they have all reasonable justifications to take such a
position."
</P>
<P>
He said the reported Saudi initiative to lift U.N. sanctions
on Iraq was "illogical."
</P>
<P>
"How can we match or get it in harmony from a country
participating an illegal actions against Iraq by imposing or
participating no-fly zone in the south of Iraq and insists to
continue its participation in this crime of aggression against
Iraq and at the same time news coming saying the same country
would propose lifting sanctions?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf urged Saudi Arabia to stop participating in the
imposition of no-fly zone in the south of Iraq and prevent the
American and British forces from using its air space to "commit
crimes of aggressions against Iraq."
</P>
<P>
"This will be also a very very much demanded step from the
Saudis," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf refuted the allegations that Iraq is pushing for a
confrontation with the United States and Britain by not
recognizing the no-fly zones in Iraq, saying the imposition of
restricted zones is illegal and has nothing to do with the
U.N. resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Official Mouthpiece Slams Saddam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The official Saudi Press
Agency (SPA) on Sunday held Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
responsible for his people's sufferings.
</P>
<P>
"Since Saddam came to power in 1979, the Iraqi people suffered
from his despotic rule which made the patient people suffer all
sorts of brutality and persecution," the SPA said in a
harshly-worded political commentary.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said Saddam Hussein was "not satisfied with
brutalizing his people but turned to his neighbors who stood with
him in difficult times."
</P>
<P>
"He stormed the territories of his neighbors, desecrated their
sanctities and got involved in an eight-year was with Iran that
crippled the potentials of the Iraqi people," it said.
</P>
<P>
It added that Saddam "turned back to his sin by calling on the
Arab people to revolt against their leaderships, instead of
improving himself."
</P>
<P>
The commentary also said that Riyadh was always seeking
support to the Iraqi people and ending the sanctions imposed
after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources in Riyadh told the Kuwait News Agency that
Saudi Arabia was planning to launch a fresh initiative for easing
the sufferings of the Iraqis, if any measures were taken for
punishing the Iraqi regime for its adverse practices.
</P>
<P>
The sources predicated that the initiative would be made
public soon, without speculating on a specific date. But Iraqi
Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf at a press conference
earlier Sunday called the Saudi move "contradictory" with its
siding with the U.S. and Britain in the mid-December airstrikes
against Iraq.

Jeddah, Saudi Arabia Sunday night to unify stances on current Arab
issues.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was aimed at formulating a joint Gulf stand on the

</P>
<P>
During a similar meeting in Riyadh on December 29, the GCC

Some new developments have emerged in the Arab arena following
the U.S.-British air strikes against Iraq in mid-December, which

The Arab foreign ministers' meeting had originally been slated
for December 30, but was postponed at the requests of the GCC
states, said Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid, secretary general of the
Cairo-based Arab League.
</P>
<P>
The last GCC summit, held in the United Arab Emirates earlier
December, stressed the need to enhance Arab relations and exert

<HEADLINE> U.N. Protests Beating of Environmentalist in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan has protested at the beating up of Kenyan environmentalist
Wangari Maathai by private security guards at Karura Forest, near
the headquarters of the U.N. Environment Program (UNEP) in the
Kenyan capital last Friday.
</P>
<P>
UNEP Executive Director Klaus Toepfer also said in a statement
issued here Sunday that he has written to the Kenyan Minister for
Environment and Natural Resources, protesting the brutal treatment
of Maathai and other environmentalists at the forest.
</P>
<P>
Maathai is a member of Annan's advisory board on disarmament
and also a UNEP Global Award winner.
</P>
<P>
" Violence and intimidation were not the way to deal with
sensitive environmental issues like Karura which must be handled
by a process of dialog and cooperation," said Toepfer.
</P>
<P>
He repeated that Karura Forest was "a precious natural resource
which the city of Nairobi cannot afford to lose. The destruction
must stop as the loss of this valuable ecosystem will have serious
environmental implications".
</P>
<P>
Annan said in a statement Saturday that he expected Kenyan
authorities to take "appropriate action" against those responsible
for attacking Maathai.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general has learned with concern that Maathai, a
 member of his advisory board on disarmament matters and
coordinator of the Green Belt Movement, was hospitalized after
being the subject of violence," a statement from Annan's office
said.
</P>
<P>
Three opposition members of parliament and two German
environmentalists were among those roughed up Friday at the Karura
Forest site, north of Nairobi, when a group of guards attacked the
Maathai-led protest group which had gone to plant trees there in a
demonstration against the sale of the forest land.
</P>
<P>
The gazetted Karura Forest, covering an area of just over 1,000
hectares, serves as a water catchments area for four rivers on the
outskirts of Nairobi and acts as "an all important lung for the
city", according to the UNEP statement.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Fighting Dust Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Beijingers have gotten used to
the dust on their glasses and dirt on their white collars when
they come back home from the streets, but they worry about their
health being affected by dust pollution.
</P>
<P>
The city is now one of the ten most polluted cities in the
world, and dust pollution control has become a priority for the
municipal government.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's 5,000 construction sites are the main source of dust
pollution, followed by coal and sand transport vehicles, accord
ing to a report in Science Times.
</P>
<P>
More than 4,600 tons of dust were cleared from the Third Ring
Road in the first 11 months of last year, according to an
official at the street-cleaning center.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that a total of 470,000 Chinese suffered from
pneumoconiosis from the 1950s to 1991, and more than 100,000 died
of this disease, caused by inhaling too much dust.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that minuscule particles of dust can enter
people's circulation systems carrying all sorts of viruses.
</P>
<P>
Ye Qian, a scientist at the Institute of Plasma Physics under
the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that the a serious flu
virus carried by dust spread over a large area of China last year.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing government has issued regulations on the
management of dust control at construction sites this year, but
Science Times said that because it is difficult to totally
control the dust sources, dispersing the dust should be tried as
another solution.
</P>
<P>
Last November, the Beijing Administration of Environment and
Sanitation began to spray the city's main streets with water
every day, and Beijing's green coverage rate has reached 40
percent, as a new afforestation project with an investment of six
billion yuan (about 723 million US dollars) was initiated at the
end of last year in order to form a screen in the northwest
portion of the city to keep the dust away.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Resettle Area Farmers in Neighboring Counties Beijing to Resettle Area Farmers to Neighboring Counties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will move another
group of over 8,000 farmers from the Miyun Reservoir area in
northeast Beijing to Shunyi County and Tongzhou District, in the
northern and eastern parts of Beijing respectively, in an effort
to protect the quality of the capital's major source of drinking
water.
</P>
<P>
Today's Beijing Economic Daily reported that the farmers are
required to move out of the reservoir area by the end of this
year as part of an overall plan to finish resettlement by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, the Beijing municipal government has been
resettling farmers from the Miyun Reservoir area into Shunyi and
Tongzhou because of the rapid economic growth which has so far
displaced 6,866 farmers in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
The government decided to quicken resettlement this year by
building or repairing houses for the farmers as soon as possible,
providing them with free food, offering preferential policies for
their farm production, giving them access to employment in rural
enterprises, and allowing them to run private businesses and
breed domestic animals.
</P>
<P>
This year's first group of farmers are expected to leave their
old homes before the on-set of the flood season.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Beijing government said these steps are
being taken to protect the environment around the Miyun reservoir
while helping the farmers there to escape from poverty.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Commerce ministers from the South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) will meet in
Dhaka from February 2-3 to discuss the process of implementing the
SAARC Preferential Trade Arrangement (SAPTA), the Foreign Ministry
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
SAARC, which groups India, Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka,
the Maldives and Bangladesh, adopted SAPTA at a SAARC summit in
Dhaka in 1993. Its main objective is to enhance trade and business
among the member countries by establishing liberalized trade and
business relations.
</P>
<P>
The objective, however, has not yet been reflected in bilateral
or multilateral trade and business due to some major differences
over trade liberalization among the member countries.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming meeting will focus on the issues in efforts to
make SAPTA a reality and a success.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has decided to put
its armed forces on maximum alert against a fresh possible Iraqi
threat to the country, the Kuwait News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made Sunday night at an emergency meeting of
Kuwait's Defense Council chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and
Defense Minister Sheikh Salem Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
The decision came after Iraqi National Assembly said Sunday
that it held Kuwait and Saudi Arabia responsible for the material
and human losses in the U.S-British air strikes against
Iraq on December 16-19.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched the air strikes with a declared
aim of punishing Iraq for not cooperating with U.N. weapons
inspectors in charge of Iraq's disarmament after the 1991 Gulf
War, triggered by Baghdad's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed sl-Sahhaf said Sunday
night that Kuwait and Saudi Arabia "have participated directly and
effectively in the U.S.-British attack."
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that U.S. cruise missiles shot through
Kuwaiti space during the bombardment. And dozens of U.S. and
British warplanes flew over Saudi Arabia and Kuwait during the air
strikes.

<HEADLINE> Modern Style Wall Posters Mark Changes in Rural China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Wall posters in many Chinese
villages, normally used for political purposes, have also
recorded changes in China's rural reform and are now increasingly
being used to advertise commodities.
</P>
<P>
One 20 year old picture still on a wall shows a young man,
too hungry to walk, leaning against a mud wall on which a slogan
in bold characters reads "Never forget class struggle".
</P>
<P>
Yan Junchang, the real man described in the picture, recalls,
"The campaign of dividing class status swept across the country
at that time. Wall slogans were a means of education called for
by the campaign."
</P>
<P>
Farmers in Yan's village, Xiaogang, in Fengyang County, Anhui
Province, suffered from starvation, but were obliged to put
farming work behind in order to carry out the political campaign.
</P>
<P>
When the rural reform was introduced in 1979, Xiaogang set the
pace for most villages by introducing a household responsibility
system, which is now most commonly practiced nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Radical political slogans were disappearing, but the tradition
of painting posters on cottage walls as a means of keeping people
informed was kept on and they began to tell a much wider story of
life in the villages.
</P>
<P>
Today, many commercial companies trying to break into the
rural market have become involved in what is described as an
"advertising war" on the walls of many farm communities' cottages
and houses. These modern wall posters are now as powerful as the
brash neon advertisements which adorn many city high-rises. F
amous domestic brands, such as Konka TV, have painted their
company names and trademarks on walls throughout rural China.
</P>
<P>
As the reform deepens, many villages have also learned to
promote their own products and goods by painting advertising
slogans on walls facing main roads such as: "China's largest
walnut market" or "Hometown for Chinese mink". Township factories
have also joined in the craze, painting useful business
information on the outside walls.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, these new style wall posters are an indication of
democratic progress as many publicize village accounts and
decisions which affect everyone in the community.
</P>
<P>
Adapting the old propaganda methods has also helped village
heads to interpret and publicize new rural policies such as: "No
good future for illiterates", "Daughters are as good as boys",
which they have painted on walls.
</P>
<P>
Xin Qiushui, a social science expert, said these
multi-function wall posters demonstrate how open the rural sector
has become in China.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Police Are Policed Too </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese police were caught
breaking the law in more than 130,000 cases last year by special
units set up to supervise the force, the Ministry of Public
Security announced today.
</P>
<P>
Over 10,000 men make up the units within China's nationwide
1,940 police brigades.
</P>
<P>
The ministry established a new supervisory bureau last
September to increase supervision and monitoring of police work.
</P>
<P>
Those who "police the policemen" dress slightly differently
from their colleagues, wearing white helmets and white
decorations on their uniforms.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, they have brought to task 27,638 policemen
found to have engaged in improper conduct or who broke the
regulations. They have also redressed 224 cases illegally handled
by other policemen.
</P>
<P>
This elite group also caught 385 people pretending to be
policemen, and confiscated 25,180 items with police badges that
had been made and sold illegally.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, they handled more than 23,000 cases last year
involving the illegal use of police badges and other false
identity items, as well as looking into incidents where police
cars had disturbed the normal life of civilians.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Security first set down its regulations
for supervising public security organizations in 1997. Since its
foundation the new police disciplinary body has focused on
drawing up comprehensive rules and regulations and instituting
new mechanisms to prevent corruption and crimes within the police
force.

<HEADLINE> Government Pledges Support For Rio's Olympic Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian government
has pledged full support for Rio de Janeiro's bid for 2008
Olympic Games, a top government official revealed here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The government will "mobilize all forces" to land the sports
extravaganza, which they believe will give a huge boost to the
country's tourism and polish their international image, the
minister of tourism, sports and youth said.
</P>
<P>
As a world-renowned tourism center and symbol of Brazil, Rio
has its special edges over other rival bids which the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) would be unlikely to
ignore, he said.
</P>
<P>
The city government declared the entry into the already
crowded race which also involved front-runners Paris and Beijing
and other possibilities such as Osaka of Japan and Kaula Lumpur
of Malaysia by officially submitting its bid to IOC on 6th this
month.
</P>
<P>
Rio's bid came amid IOC's cash-for-votes bribery scandals
which have brought down two senior officials of the Salt Lake
City 2002 Winter Olympic bid and are set to be snowballing with
more investigations going on.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi, China's Top Sugar Producer for Six Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Sugar production in southwest
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, one of the country's
leading sugarcane growers, hit a record high of 3.23 million tons
during the 1997-98 sugar pressing season, a hefty increase of 38
percent from the previous season.
</P>
<P>
Its output of sugar, according to the regional government,
accounts for 40 percent of the country's total and ranks ninth
among the world's largest sugar production bases.
</P>
<P>
The sugar producing sector realized a total of 8.65 billion
yuan in output value during the 97-98 period, about nine percent
of Guangxi's total output value. In the same period, the sector
also recorded total sales of more than 11 billion yuan and paid
some 1.5 billion yuan in tax, which was 11 percent of region's
total revenue.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, Guangxi has topped the country in sugar production
for six straight years. But back in 1958 when Guangxi was first
declared an autonomous region, it had only nine sugar factories
with an annual output of 66,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Before 1988, most of the sugar factories were small-scale
workshops. However, with the 160 million yuan in financial
support from the central government between 1988 and 1995, the
region's sugar production sector grew rapidly, and presently it
has 110 sugar factories with a daily sugar pressing capacity of
250,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> Asian Crisis Shrinks African Economies:UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The East Asian financial crisis
has contributed to the slash in Africa's steady economic growth by
almost 50 percent in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Monday's Zambia Daily Mail quoted an article contained in
Industrial Africa, a publication of the United Nations Industrial
Development Organization (UNIBO), as saying there was a major
slump in Africa's economic growth in 1997, which saw a decline in
the continent's GDP from 5. 8 percent in 1996 to 3.2 percent in
1997.
</P>
<P>
There was also a drop in the GDP for sub-Saharan Africa from
five percent in 1996 to 3.2 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The publication notes that Africa's export earnings are likely
to be reduced significantly due to the persistent decline in world
commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, export of Africa's textiles, garments, cocoa,
wood, rubber, palm oil, vegetable oils and other products could be
hit by more competitive Asian products following the devaluation
of Asian currencies in the wake of the financial crisis," the
publication reads in part.
</P>
<P>
However, the article suggests the need for Africa to be quick
in implementing economic reforms to strengthen the continents
economies and reduce their vulnerability to external shocks. It
suggests both long and short term strategies.
</P>
<P>
Among the short term actions suggested are the adoption of
sound, consistent economic policies for low inflation and small
budget deficit, the maintenance of a sustainable current account
with a flexible exchange rate through monetary and fiscal
discipline and strengthening the banking and financial system
through increased supervision and strict and prudential
regulations.
</P>
<P>
For the long term strategy, the article says, "The aim is to
remove structural constraints, strengthen competitiveness, seek
new comparative advantage, carve out new markets and create the
basis for new vigor and dynamism for sustainable growth."

<HEADLINE> S. African Police Cells Leak Like Sieves: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 11 (Xinhua) -- An average of 100
prisoners escape from South African police holding cells each
month with the lack of facilities at police stations cited as a
major contributing factor, Sowetan newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
National police statistics show that 3,818 prisoners escaped
from police custody in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) as
saying that police cells were not designed to hold such a great
number of detainees or to cope with the often lengthy periods of
detention.
</P>
<P>
The ISS believed that overcrowding contributed to escapes.
</P>
<P>
Poor buildings and insufficient security, such as no fencing
and bad lighting, decrease the ability of police to detain
prisoners and prevent escapes.
</P>
<P>
The ISS said police stations should be upgraded and enclosed
with barbed wire fencing to eliminate escapes and the smuggling in
of weapons which are used in the escapes.
</P>
<P>
The paper did not say when the ISS made the remarks.

<HEADLINE> Rare Snow Falls on Southwest China's "Spring City" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Kunming, capital of southwest
China's Yunnan Province, today saw a rare heavy snowfall that
soon coated this renowned "Spring City" in white.
</P>
<P>
Excited local residents flocked out amid the large snowflakes
to enjoy the rare scene of snow-covered roads and buildings,
while joyful children cheered and played in the streets, braving
the zero degrees Celsius temperature.
</P>
<P>
"This is the largest snowfall in Kunming since 1983, and there
are only seven or eight snowfalls in the city's historical
records," said an official with the local meteorological bureau.
</P>
<P>
The snowfall began at 8 pm on Sunday evening, beginning as
sleet. Big flakes started to fall at five am today and hadn't
stopped by press time. Local weather reports said that by eight
o'clock this morning, total precipitation in the Kunming region
had exceeded 15.1 millimeters.
</P>
<P>
As the snow piled up to three centimeters on the runways and
the whirling flakes reduced the visibility to a dangerous level,
the Kunming Airport had to cancel 22 domestic flights and ask 9
flights due at Kunming before eight am today to land at other
airports.
</P>
<P>
Airport authorities said there are now some 900 domestic and
foreign passengers stranded at the airport.
</P>
<P>
However, traffic police said the snowfall caused little
trouble for urban traffic, with no reports of traffic jams or
accidents.
</P>
<P>
Kunming has earned the reputation as China's "Spring City"
with its year-round mild climate and an annual average
temperature of 14.5 degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>
Local meteorologists believe that today's snowfall was mainly
caused by the convergence of a cold air current from the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and a warm and damp air current from the
Bay of Bengal.

KAMPALA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba is expected in Kampala this week to have talks with
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni on the situation in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a senior Ugandan official
said.
</P>
<P>
Monday's New Vision daily quoted State Minister of Regional
Cooperation Amama Mbabazi as saying over the weekend that Chiluba
is coming for talks to resolve the DRC crisis.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said Sunday that he hoped to convene a 14-nation summit
this week on ending the five-month-long civil war in the third
largest African country, but left open the question of rebel
participation, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba told reporters that Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
had urged him to convene the summit as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba visited Rwanda last week and was expected to go on from
Zimbabwe to other countries involved in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola, Chad and Namibia have been supporting DRC
President Laurent Kabila while Uganda and Rwanda are reportedly
behind the Tutsi rebels.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts and South Africa's government fear that the
DRC war contains the seeds of a broader African conflict.
</P>
<P>
Some regional analysts say Mugabe is looking for a way out
because the war is undermining his political support, and that
Angola wants out to focus on its own war against Jonas Savimbi's
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela has made the rebel
participation in peace talks a condition of his country's
involvement in the proposed summit, which has already been
postponed three times.

<HEADLINE> Oldest Great Wall Built 2,500 Years Ago, Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Many know that the self-styled
first emperor Qin Shihuang initiated the building of the ancient
Great Wall, but some Chinese experts now believe that the
earliest part of the Great Wall was built 2,500 years ago, or
three hundred years before the first emperor.
</P>
<P>
"The earliest part of the Great Wall has been found in the
Shandong Province, which roughly parallels the ancient Qi
Kingdom," Zhang Guangming, deputy chief of the cultural relics
bureau of the city of Zibo in Shandong, said today.
</P>
<P>
The Qi Great Wall started at a small village in Changqing
County and ran to the sea near Qingdao for a total length of 620
kilometers, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
According to historical records, the now-dilapidated wall had
12 passes, nine gates, 50 castles and barracks and 12 beacon
towers, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The winding wall comprised the southern fortifications of
this strong kingdom," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The Kingdom of Qi at that time contended with others for
hegemony and its king Huangong was one of the five most powerful
dukes during the Spring and Autumn period (770 B.C. -- 476 B.C.).
</P>
<P>
"It was extremely difficult for the ancient people to build
such giant military defenses," Zhang said,  and laborers in the
kingdom spent 170 years in building the wall, according to some
historians.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists recently unearthed cultural ruins and relics
near this section of the Great Wall, and the new finds will aid
in the study on the Qi Culture.
</P>
<P>
In the course of Chinese history, more than 20 emperors
ordered the building or renovation of the Great Wall, which
eventually gained a length of more than 5,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The most famous part of the Great Wall was built during the
Ming Dynasty (1368 -- 1644), and the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization has listed this Badaling
Section in suburban Beijing as a World Heritage site.

<HEADLINE> Privately Run Universities Flourish in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Beijing-based newspaper said that since its first
privately run university, Zhonghua Social University, opened in
1982, the city has established some 95 such institutions with
250,000 students and assets of 270 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
A Beijing Municipal Government official said that together
with publicly run universities and universities for adult
education, private universities have become an important part of
Beijing's higher education system.
</P>
<P>
About 95 percent of the private university students are those
who have failed to pass the national entrance examination, and
privately run universities in Beijing provide these students with
majors in popular fields such as law, computer science, English,
and food and nutrition.
</P>
<P>
These private universities have been established with funds
from sponsor investments, overseas endowments, and university-run
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In a recent appraisal by the Beijing Municipal Education
Commission, 21 out of the 95 privately run universities received
excellent grades, and a majority of these universities are fully
accredited schools.
</P>
<P>
Beijing hopes to make ten of the private universities
nationwide exemplary institutes within three to five years, the
paper said.

ABU DHABI, January 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
has said whether the Palestinian National Authority finally
declares an independent state on May 4 this year depends on
developments in the situation over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Abu Mazin, the Secretary General of the Executive Committee of

"By that time, the issues of refugees, settlements, borders and
the fate of Jerusalem (in the status talks) should have been dealt
with so that a Palestinian state, with Jerusalem as its capital,
could be declared," Abu Mazin said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Ahthority Chairman Yesser Arafat on
several occasions threatened to declare an independent state by May
4 no matter a final peace deal with Israel is signed or not.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel are currently locked in disputes
over security concerns on the part of Israel. Israel has suspended
troops deployments as laid down in the Wye accord, citing the
Palestinian side's failure to bring violence against Israel under
control.
</P>
<P>
On the advancement of Israel's parliamentary election, Abu
Mazin said it is just an attempt to evade commitments made in the
Wye deal.
</P>
<P>
"The deal is well-balanced. It gives the Israelis peace and
gives us redeployment, release of prisoners and other rights.
(Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu thinks he will
take what he does not have and not give what he has," he said.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with Zayed, Abu Mazin delivered him a message
from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
He said Zayed advised Arafat to be patient in reaction to
Israel's refusal to implement Wye River Memorandum, because the
Israeli elections has made the situation complicated and
nervousness "may lead to negative consequences."

PARIS, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers on Monday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- In an article contributed to Liberation, British Prime
Minister Tony Blair justified Britain's participation in the
``Desert Fox'' operation. He said that Britain does not seek to
play the role of world policeman with the United States, but the
lack of action against Saddam Hussein would cost a tremendous
price. He also said that those who think Saddam Hussein will
cooperate more when the sanctions are lifted are ``covering their
own eyes.''
</P>
<P>
-- Bosnian Serb war crime suspect Dragan Gagovic was shot dead
last Saturday by French soldiers of the SFOR operation of NATO.
Gagovic was driving back to Foca, Bosnia, from Montenegro with
five of his daughters. All his children were unhurt. Gagovic was
searched by the International Tribunal in the Hague on war crimes
in ex-Yugoslavia for years for rapes and torture during the war
in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The death of Dragan Gagovic, a Bosnian Serb war crime
suspect who was killed by French soldiers of SFOR, has caused
anger among Bosnian Serbs, but Washington and Paris said it was a
warning to those who want to get away from international justice.
Gagovic was accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity by
the International Tribunal in the Hague in charge of putting on
trial war criminals in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
-- The French electricity material group Schneider is expected
to announce on Monday its merger with the Scandinavian electricity
 material group Lexel. Schneider has an annual sales figure of 5
billion francs (910 million U.S. dollars), while the Lexel has a
sales figure of 4 billion francs (720 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Shuttle Talks on Cyprus Issue Re-commence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.N.-sponsored shuttle
talks on Cyprus issue has re-commenced, Ann Hercus, the
U.N. Resident Representative, said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement after meeting with Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides, Hercus said she will be meeting with Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash later in the week.
</P>
<P>
She said she will meet again with President Clerides early
next week.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored shuttle talks began in mid-October 1998 in
a new bid to seek for a settlement to the protracted Cyprus
issue. The talks are now re-started in the light of Cyprus'
decision not to deploy the Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft
missiles on the island.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Cyprus ordered S-300 missiles from Russia in a bid to
booster its defense, a move rejected by Turkey which threatened to
launch preemptive strike on the missiles if they were deployed.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides decided on December 29, 1998 to cancel
the deployment of the missiles after consultation with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of a failed pro-Athens coup. The U.N. has been trying for
decades to reunite the island.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Asks for 300 Million Dollars for Site Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) will allow the United States to inspect
a "sensitive" site, which the latter suspects is being used to
develop nuclear weapons, if it pays 300 million dollars, a
Foreign Ministry spokesman said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"If the United States pays 300 million dollars in compensation
for blasphemy, we will allow a once-only visit to Kumchangri,"
the spokesman told the Korean Central News Agency.
</P>
<P>
If it is not convenient for the United States to pay in
compensation, it must give the DPRK some appropriate economic
benefits, he said before the talks scheduled to be held between
the two countries Saturday and Sunday in Geneva over Pyongyang's
underground construction.
</P>
<P>
The construction of Kumchangri, which is located in North
Pyongan Province, is "a sensitive target both for the national
security and technology" and once it is opened to the United
States, it could not be used for the original purpose, so it is
quite right for the DPRK to raise such a demand, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that since the signing of the framework of
agreement in 1994 between the two countries, the DPRK has been
honestly fulfilling its obligations and did not conduct any
nuclear activities.
</P>
<P>
However, the United States did not properly fulfill its part.
If this situation continues, the DPRK will lose interest in the
agreement, which would unavoidably come to break, the spokesman
added.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Issue Farm Bonds in Stages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government Monday
assured the banking sector that agriculture development bonds will
be issued in stages and there would be "no unnecessary risks" in
the issuance.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican allayed fears by bankers
that the government may not exercise enough caution in issuing the
Economic Recovery Through Agriculture Productivity (ERAP) bonds.
</P>
<P>
"The issuance of the ERAP bonds will be done in stages," he
said. "There will no be a one-shot deal."
</P>
<P>
The Department of Finance expects the government to issue the
bonds at 25 million U.S. dollars to 50 million U.S. dollars at
each stage, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated that the disbursements of the proceeds from
the issuance of the bonds will go to "agriculture projects and
development, an area where banks tend to be too conservative in
lending."
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada last December authorized
the issuance of 1.25-billion-U.S. dollar worth of long-term,
tax-exempt bonds to tap the support of private banks in
modernizing the agriculture sector.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Fears Rapid AIDS Epidemic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Medical experts have warned
that China's largest city of Shanghai could be on the verge of a
rapid growth of HIV/AIDS cases if public awareness of preventive
measures is not given priority.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last November, the city, which has some 12
million residents, had 183 people registered as infected by HIV,
or the AIDS virus. But the actual figure might be higher and will
reach 16,000 next year, said today's Shanghai-based "Wenhui
Daily".
</P>
<P>
And China as a whole might have over one million HIV/AIDS
patients by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai-based newspaper listed likely causes of a
potential outbreak, such as increasing prostitution, intravenous
drug use (IDU), illegal blood deals, an increase in the floating
population and lack of awareness about self protection among
ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey found that more than 33 percent of
Shanghainese did not know that using condoms could help prevent
transmission of the virus, and 20 percent didn't think that
drug-taking using needles that were handed around had any
connection with HIV infection.
</P>
<P>
Another poll among 3,000 college students suggested that half
of them underestimated the risk of HIV infection as a result of
high incidences of sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
An AIDS patient in China might spend 12,000 yuan (1,440 US
dollars) on annual treatment while causing 200,000 yuan in terms
of indirect medical expenditure and economic losses, according to
the research.
</P>
<P>
"Thus Shanghai could face a bill of 3.4 billion yuan each year
if HIV/AIDS cases reach 16,000," the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Global Warming Aggravating Water Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Global warming will further
aggravate the water shortage problem in North China as
evaporation of river water will far exceed rainfall, reported a
recent issue of the China Water Resources News.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted scientist Ye Duzheng as saying that
compared with the current level, the temperature will be
increasing by 1.0-1.5 in winter by the year 2030, with rainfall
remaining unchanged, while the summer temperature will witness a
rise of 0.5-0.8 degrees Celsius, with rainfall edging up by 1-2
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the rainfall that results from global warming will
not be enough to make up the loss in river water, said the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the flow in the Haihe and Luanhe rivers will drop
by three to six percent from the present level.
</P>
<P>
Higher temperatures and severe water shortages will bring about
 a rise in winter wheat production, but a drop in spring wheat
and corn.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the changed climate is also threatening to expand
the dry and arid area further north, forming a large sandy
desert.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam PM Calls for Application of New Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's Prime Minister Phan Van
Khai has called for rapid application of the latest technology,
including that of management, to production and other fields,
official media reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"This is a decisive factor for Vietnam to avoid lagging behind
in economics and technology in its international and regional
integration process," said Khai.
</P>
<P>
Khai was speaking at a congress of the Vietnam Union of
Scientific and Technological Associations in Hanoi last week. He
dwelled upon the main tasks of the intellectual circle.
</P>
<P>
He said Vietnamese intellectuals must take more responsibility
for perfecting the party and state's policies, promoting the
socialism-oriented renovation as well as overcoming shortcomings
caused by non-principle adventure or dogmatism.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said building socialism in Vietnam is "a new
great cause but is without any ready-made model" and the Communist
Party of Vietnam has mapped out main features for the cause.
</P>
<P>
However, there exist many issues needed to be clarified in the
socialism-oriented renovation, Khai noted, describing it as an
"important and long-lasting task."
</P>
<P>
He highlighted the development of human resources and average
education level as a major responsibility of intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
Khai urged the intellectuals to show exemplary models in
cultural and disciplinary lifestyle, saying the preservation and
display of national identities was a factor to ensure the
country's sustainable development.

<P>
SEOUL, January 11 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung Monday urged the United States to be patient in dealing
with the suspected underground nuclear facilities and missile
development program in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK).
</P>
<P>
Kim made the remarks when he met with a nine-member delegation
from the U.S. House of Representatives led by Douglas Bereuter,
head of the House Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
President Kim had full and frank discussions with the U.S. legi
slators and said there are both "positive and negative" changes
in Pyongyang, presidential spokesman Park Jie-won said.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman declined to disclose details of the
discussions, saying they included some "delicate issues."
</P>
<P>
The Republican-controlled U.S. House has been pressuring
Pyongyang for inspection of the suspected underground nuclear
facility in the country since last year.
</P>
<P>
President Kim is concerned that Washington's tough stance
could impact his pursuit of "sunshine policy" of engaging the
DPRK.

<HEADLINE> New Loans For China's Largest Sugar Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region, the largest sugar producer in the
country, will receive a 1.25-billion-yuan loan from the regional
branches of the Agricultural Bank of China and the Industrial &AMP;
Commercial Bank of China for sugar reserves, according to today's
Economic Daily.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi accounts for 40 percent of all the sugar output in
China, and more than 20 million farmers are engaged in sugar cane
growing in the region. The slump in sugar prices in recent years
has placed Guangxi's sugar industry in serious difficulty.
</P>
<P>
The central government has taken steps to strengthen its
regulation of the sugar industry in order to ameliorate the price
slump, and loans are being granted to Guangxi to help establish a
sugar reserve of 370,000 tons for industrial use.
</P>
<P>
Sugar producers in Guangxi began adopting the prices suggested
by the State Development Planning Commission on December 12 last
year, and the new loans are expected to help stabilize sugar
prices.

<HEADLINE> HK Receives More Tourists from Inland Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region received the largest number of tourists
ever from inland areas in 1998 with an estimated 2.5 million
arrivals, up 13 percent over 1997.
</P>
<P>
During the January-November period last year, visitors to Hong
Kong from inland areas exceeded the 1996 high of 2.31 million,
according to B.Y. Wong, an official with the Hong Kong Tourist
Association.
</P>
<P>
Wong, who is in charge of inland-area tourist affairs,
attributed the increase to the further relaxing of restrictions
imposed on inland-resident travelers to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China International Tourist Service, the largest
travel group in China, obtained the approval to run a Hong Kong
travel service in the latter half of 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Hong Kong Tourist Association indicate
that China's inland areas surpassed Japan to became the largest
tourist resource for Hong Kong in 1997, with each inland-area
traveler spending about 5,000 HK dollars (about 640 U.S. dollars)
during their stay in Hong Kong.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 11 (Xinhua) -- South African Moslem
groups have warned that they would go to war with the government
if one of their supporters wounded by police should die.
</P>
<P>
Yusuf Jacobs, 25, was reportedly in a critical condition after
he was shot in the head with a rubber bullet last Friday when
police dispersed Moslems demonstrating against Britain's role in
the recent air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"If anything happens to that brother, we swear to Allah, this
country will become ungovernable," Salih Abadah, the security
chief of vigilante group People Against Gangsterism and Drugs
(Pagad), told a mass rally in Cape Town Sunday, media reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Three Moslem groups Sunday held a placard demonstration at Cape
Town's Waterfront, protesting against "police brutality" and
promising revenge.
</P>
<P>
Pagad leader Abdusalaam Ebrahim told reporters on the spot that
the demonstration was peaceful, but if Jacobs died, "all of this
is going to take a very different turn."
</P>
<P>
Relations between the authorities and Pagad and other Moslem
groups have long been tense, but deteriorated recently.
</P>
<P>
Eight members of Moslems Against Global Oppression and Moslems
Against Illegitimate leaders were arrested during flag-burning
protests outside parliament and the American embassy.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- A total of 117 people were
killed and 237 injured in 78 serious fires across China last
year, according to the Firefighting Bureau under the Ministry of
Public Security.
</P>
<P>
The death toll was about 74 percent lower than in 1997, and
direct economic losses, totaling 270 million yuan ( 33 million US
dollars), were about 27 percent under the figure for 1997.
</P>
<P>
The most deadly blaze claimed 24 lives and injured 14 people
when it engulfed a six-storey hotel in the city of Tonghua in
northeast China's Jilin Province during the early hours of
January 3, 1998, said a report in the China Police Daily.
</P>
<P>
Another conflagration, at a hospital in the city of Changzhou
in east China's Jiangsu Province on August 26, killed 14 patients
and nurses. Faulty electric wiring in violation of regulations
was blamed for the fire.
</P>
<P>
Seven firefighters were killed and eleven injured when they
tried to put out the flames after several gas tanks exploded in
suburban Xi'an in Shaanxi Province on March 5.
</P>
<P>
Furniture malls, factories and department stores run a much
higher risk of burning because of their storage of inflammables,

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Says No Difficulties in Raising Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said Monday it
does not face difficulties in raising funds to finance its
economic recovery plan, as it can raise them locally while foreign
lenders are also offering loans at attractive rates.
</P>
<P>
The National Economic Action Council (NEAC), set up to
spearhead Malaysia's recovery from the economic slowdown caused by
the regional currency turmoil, said in a statement that in view of
the government's success in raising a financial package locally as
well as from Japan, "several other foreign lenders have recently
approached the Malaysian government with funds at attractive
rates."
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's National Economic Recovery Plan needs about 62
billion ringgit (16.315 billion U.S. dollars) throughout
1998-2000.
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of the funding will be sourced locally, mainly
involving borrowings from local institutions, the NEAC said. The
government recently concluded an agreement with locally-based
foreign banks for a loan of 1.35 billion U.S. dollars at an
interest rate of 8.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
The foreign sources of funds which have been tapped included a
structured loan of 560 million U.S. dollars from Sumitomo Bank of
Japan, guaranteed by Japan's Ministry of International Trade and
Industry (MITI); the Japan EXIM Bank loan of 500 million U.S.
dollars, for which an agreement would be signed soon, and 5
billion U.S. dollars pledged by the Japanese government under the
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF), it said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia would continue to tap its traditional multilateral
sources as these offer funds at relatively low rates, it said,
adding that total loans from the World Bank, the Asian Development
Bank and the Islamic Development Bank would amount to 1.1 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In sum, Malaysia has put in place a financial package that can
adequately fund the recovery plan, the NEAC said, allaying
concerns about Malaysia's ability to finance the recovery plan.

<HEADLINE> Stock Investors Increasing in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The number of individual
stock-market accounts in Beijing reached 1.46 million by the end
of 1998, which means that one out of every ten Beijing residents
is a stock investor.
</P>
<P>
The total number of institutional accounts totaled 7,300 last
year, according to statistics from a Beijing stock registration
company.
</P>
<P>
Some 355,700 new individual accounts and 2,040 new
institutional accounts opened last year, down 22.1 percent and
31.1 percent respectively from 1997.
</P>
<P>
The stock market in China last year was not as brisk as in
1997, which resulted in a slower growth in the number of local
stock investors, today's Beijing Economic Daily quoted an expert
from the registration company as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the second half of last year, the stock market faced a
declining trend, and people tended to put their money in bank
deposits instead of stock exchanges, because they thought the
risk of economic loss was higher in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
Experts said there is a saturation point for the number of
investors, and predicted that the number of stock investors in
Beijing may sustain a much slower growth after the rapid
increases of the past few years.

LAGOS, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's People's Democratic
Party (PDP) has reaffirmed its nationwide spread and strength when
it won 18 out of 31 state where the results of Saturday election

</P>
<P>
The All People's Party (APP) came second with seven states

Osun, Ondo and Ekiti.

The APP, whose image has been tarnished by links of some of its
leaders to late dictator Sani Abacha, recorded victory in the
northwestern and north-central parts of the west African country.
</P>
<P>
Results of House of Assembly elections also showed the PDP as
topping the chart with 430 seats while the APP won 156 seats with

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Uses 14 Bln Dollars in Foreign Investment in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment capital
disbursed in Vietnam in the last 10 years has reached 14 billion
U.S. dollars, accounting for 36 percent of registered capital,
according to an official report here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) said that a total
of 2,545 foreign-invested projects have been licensed since the
promulgation of the law on foreign investment in Vietnam in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 2,061 projects with a total registered capital of
34.31 billion U.S. dollars possess valid licenses, of which 1,000
projects are operational.
</P>
<P>
The foreign-invested sector has registered 3.23 billion U.S.
dollars in export turnover in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign investment sources are an important supplementary
source for Vietnam's economic growth," MPI Deputy Minister Do Ngoc
Trinh said.
</P>
<P>
She said foreign invested projects increased their share of
gross domestic product (GDP) from two percent in 1992 to 9 percent
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, weaknesses in the management of foreign investment
activities have existed over the past 10 years, including
cumbersome procedures, incomplete land planning regulations and
management, misunderstanding between investors and their partners,
and the shortage of qualified local managers, said Nguyen Nhac,
who is also an MPI deputy minister.
</P>
<P>
This year, Vietnam will continue to lower land rents, service
charges,  and electricity, water and transport costs.
</P>
<P>
The government will also further simplify entry-exist
procedures for foreign businessmen and re-consider a number of
taxes and wage policy.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- A Yemeni official source disclosed that the government
discussed Thursday a strategy of land, maritime and air transport
in Yemen.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided to promote the involvement of private
sectors in various forms of transportation, the Arabic daily Al
Hayat reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
BAGHDAD -- Iraqi Commercial Bank has decided for the first time
to issue credit cards entitled "Iraq Express", to ensure the
purchase of commodities without being obliged to carry lots of
cash, in view of the devalued Iraqi dinar.
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of the Baghdad weekly Nabd Al Shabab quotes a
source at the private Iraqi bank as saying that such service is
the first of its kind in Iraq, and will make banking services
similar to many other countries.
</P>
<P>
The bank fixed a credit card value at 150,000 dinars which, in
fact, is less than 100 dollars.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The World Gold Council expects that 1.5 billion
U.S. dollars of foreign investments will flow into the Egyptian
gold ornaments manufacturing in the near future if its domestic
sales taxes on gold industry are amended.
</P>
<P>
The consultant of the council in Cairo, Samah Nabil, has
disclosed that investments in Egyptian gold industry are estimated
at about 10 billion Egyptian pounds (2.9 billion dollars), with
the imports standing at some 3 billion dollars, the Arabic daily
Alam Al Yom reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian official said that Canadian, Lebanese, Saudi and
Swiss investors have the will to invest in the gold industry in
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Chiefs of Egyptian fertilizer companies have submitted
a letter to the government, urging intervention in the fertilizer
trade to secure a market share for home-made fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
The annual fertilizer trade volume stands at 4 billion pounds
(1.17 billion dollars), but the market has been nibbled by foreign
brands, which are sold at half prices of local ones, the Alam Al
Yom reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The foreign fertilizer products are mainly from Libya, Saudi
Arabia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The exports from Egyptian public and private zones
reached 74 million dollars in October and November 1998, compared
with the 61 million dollars in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
A report by the Egyptian Investment Authority has revealed that
the products produced in these zones to European and American
markets increased by 76 percent and 37 percent respectively in
1998 over 1997, the Alam Al Yom reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt and Saudi Arabia have clinched a deal, under
which Egypt will export to the kingdom 100,000 tents to meet the
needs for the next pilgrimage season.
</P>
<P>
Sami Aouf, chairman of Port Said Weaving and Spinning Company,
said the tents will be made up of fire-resistant material, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Aouf added that his firm has received orders for tent material
and tents from a number of African countries and the United
Nations Relief and Works Agency in the Near East.
</P>

CAIRO -- More than 120 Egyptian companies will attend an
exhibition of Egypt's products, to be staged in Dammam, Saudi
Arabia, on February 16-26, the MENA reported Monday.

exhibition, which comes under a plan to promote Egyptian exports
to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>

billion Egyptian pounds (735 million dollars) in 1997, accounting
for about 30 percent of the inter-Arab trade.

<HEADLINE> Infiltration of Foreign Movies Will be Checked in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Information
Ministry is determined to stop the infiltration of Cambodia's
airwaves by foreign programming and is urging local television
stations to screen Khmer movies three times a week in order to
promote Khmer culture.
</P>
<P>
According to the Cambodia Daily Monday, the ministry is taking
aim at a multitude of foreign films on television.
</P>
<P>
The move is one of several made by the Information Ministry to
fight back the invasion of foreign cultural influences.
</P>
<P>
Thai and Chinese movies dubbed into Khmer are shown regularly.
Cambodia's film industry, which saw a boom in the late 1980s and
early 1990s when hundreds of films were produced annually, has
nearly vanished.
</P>
<P>
Only a handful of production companies and those producing
mostly karaoke videos have survived. Former movie stars now hold
other jobs or perform in the music videos.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia has six TV stations. But only the state-run TV
Kampuchea shows a Cambodian movie each afternoon, and the other
five private-run stations rarely broadcast Khmer movies.
</P>
<P>
A number of factors are discouraging TV stations from showing
Cambodian films -- a shortage of films, the cost, and a lack of
interest among viewers. To buy a Thai movie from a distributor
costs only 90 U.S. dollars, but a Cambodian movie costs more than
1,200 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The revenues may also be a deciding factor. Facing fierce
competitions, private stations prefer to run the more popular
foreign films that attract viewers.
</P>
<P>
The government's move was welcomed by some Cambodian movie
stars as a boost to the film industry and an incentive to movie
producers and TV stations to work together in promoting local
movies and the Khmer culture.

<HEADLINE> India to set up Second National Commission on Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Indian Labor Minister S. N.
Jatiya said Monday that a second national commission on labor was
being set up this month in a bid to protect millions of workers in
the unorganized sector.
</P>
<P>
The commission would take into account the opening up of the
economy, international competitiveness and the needs and demands
of the future labor market, Jatiya told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Since the first national labor commission was set up more than
30 years ago, developments in the economic sector have brought
about radical changes in the domestic industrial climate and the
labor market. The existing labor laws did not appear to be
adequately equipped to tackle effectively the challenges thrown up
by these changes, he said.
</P>
<P>
The new commission would study labor laws pertaining to social
security, occupational safety and health and minimum wages,
linking wages with productivity and safeguards, he said.

<HEADLINE> Oil Town in N. Angola in Danger: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The rebel UNITA forces are
poised to mount attacks on Mbanza-Congo, capital of Zaire Province
in northern Angola, aiming to capture the important oil town of
Soyo, the official Jornal of Angola newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that recently the National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) forces took over the city of
Cuimba, 60 kilometers west of Mbanza-Congo and massed there some
1,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
It charged that some 300 Banyamulunge rebels from the
Democratic Republic of Congo and mercenary troops from Uganda and
Rwanda, who are equipped with tanks and long-range artillery, are
fighting together with the UNITA forces.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA militia turned north after they were defeated in
central provinces of Huambo and Bie. They have reportedly taken
most parts of the provinces of Malanje and Uige before arriving in
Zaire Province.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that the UNITA troops are aiming to take
over Mbanza- Congo and then to capture the town of Soyo at the
mouth of Congo River to cut the supply route of the government
troops. The largest oil supply base of Kwanda is located in Soyo
where over 40 percent of Angola's oil is exported.
</P>
<P>
Oil earns the Angolan some 80 percent of its foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan military sources said that the government troops
will strengthen their final defense lines to protect the
provincial capital and the oil town.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the new year, fierce battles have taken
place in many towns in Zaire Province.
</P>
<P>
In northern Malanje Province, 11 out of the 14 towns had been
taken by the UNITA troops and even province capital Malanje is
incessantly attacked by the rebels.

<HEADLINE> Review of 1998 Foreign Exchanges by China's Trade Unions (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The All-China Federation of
Trade Unions (ACFTU) today said farewell to its first group of
foreign visitors of 1999, as a delegation from the World
Federation of Trade Unions headed by General Secretary Alexander
Zharikov departed after an 8-day China tour.
</P>
<P>
Xia Xiaomei, director of the International Liaison Department
of the ACFTU, said that the ACFTU further enhanced friendly ties
with their counterparts in neighboring countries, developed
traditional friendships with those in developing countries, and
restored and improved relations with those in Western countries
in the past year, in line with the principle of independence and
extensive exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
(ACFTU) received 75 delegations from Asia, Africa, America and
Europe, and sent 55 visiting groups to other countries.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, the ACFTU had forged friendly ties with
more than 400 national trade union organizations in 130 countries
and regions.
</P>
<P>
The ACFTU has always upheld the principles of independence,
equality, mutual respect, and non-interference in each other's
internal affairs, and promoted the image of the Chinese workers
as independent and self-confident with a love of world peace.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, foreign guests of the ACFTU acquired a better
understanding of the Chinese workers' current situation and the
efforts made by the Chinese government to protect their rights.
</P>
<P>
Two delegations of Japanese trade unions visited China in 1998
to mark the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Japanese
Peace and Friendship Treaty. During their stay in China, the
Japanese visitors went to several historic sites including the
Memorial Hall of the War of Resistance Against Japanese
Aggression, and both sides planted trees as a symbol of the
everlasting friendship between China and Japan.

<HEADLINE> Center-Left DSP Leader Becomes Turkish Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's center-left Democratic
Left Party (DSP) Chairman Bulent Ecevit announced Monday that he
is ruling the newly established 56th government.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit made the announcement at the presidential palace after a
30-minute meeting with President Suleyman Demirel, who approved a
cabinet list submitted by Ecevit.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said the new government includes three posts of
interior ministry, justice ministry and transportation ministry
for independent parliamentary deputies.
</P>
<P>
He has appointed Husamettin Ozkan Deputy Prime Minister, Hikmet
Sami Turk National Defense Minister and Ismail Cem remains as
Foreign Minister, Ecevit said.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit, who was deputy prime minister of the ousted government
led by motherland Party (ANAP) leader Mesut Yilmaz, was
reassigned by Demirel to form the new government last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Yilmaz government collapsed in November in a no-confidence
vote in parliament because of corruption scandals.
</P>
<P>
Demirel bucked at appointing the leader of the largest party in
the parliament to form a cabinet because such an appointment will
bring the pro-Islamic Virtue Party to power, angering the
pro-secular military.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit tried for three weeks to form a new government in
December, but failed to command a majority in the parliament. He
was reassigned after an independent lawmaker was also unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit served as prime minister in 1974 when the Turkish
government landed its troops and took over the northern one third
of Cyprus, in the wake of an abortive pro-Greece coup.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz and True Path Party (DYP) leader Tansu Ciller have
promised to support Ecevit's minority government from outside,
which can secure the new prime minister a majority in the
parliament in a vote of confidence set for Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Trade Relations Increasingly Important To Sino-U.S. Relations (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Sun Zhenyu, vice-minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, said here on Monday that
trade relations have become increasingly more important to
Sino-U.S. relations in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Sun spoke with Xinhua about the 20th anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the
United States and said that the expansion of economic and trade
relations has helped stabilize bilateral relations, providing a
countless number of job opportunities in both countries, and
increasing exchanges and friendship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Sino-U.S. trade relations and economic cooperation have helped
each other, Sun said, and now account for a major part of China's
foreign economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Trade with the United States grew 20-fold between 1979 and
1997 and adds up to 309.6 billion U.S. dollars. It increased at
an average annual rate of 9.4 percent in the 1980s and 23 percent
during the 1990-1997 period, well above the overall 16 percent
growth in China's foreign trade. By 1997, when Sino-U.S. trade
was worth nearly 49 billion U.S. dollars, it accounted for 15
percent of China's overall foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Sun estimated that Sino-U.S. trade in 1998 will amount to
about 55 billion U.S. dollars, a 12 percent increase from the
previous year. The U.S. is China's 2nd largest trade partner, and
China is the 4th largest trade partner of the United States.

<TEXT>
<P>
Bilateral investment also grew steadily, Sun said, with direct
investment from the United States growing as China continues its
reforms and opening up. The U.S. ranks first among all nations in
direct investment.
</P>
<P>
Chinese investment in the United States is still quite small.
The greatest benefit Chinese companies in the United States get
is experience in overseas business operations, Sun said, and by
using U.S. markets and resources, they will continue to increase
investment there.
</P>
<P>
He said that the main feature of bilateral trade is the
development of cooperation. Recent exchanges of visits of senior
leaders of both countries have helped the smooth growth of
bilateral trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that the trade disputes are "normal" for
rapidly-growing trade relations and should be resolved through
consultations based on equality. These disputes should be viewed
from a development perspective, he said, and because some
disputes have been resolved successfully in that way. He believes
others can also be resolved as well.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year history of Sino-U.S. relations shows that
bilateral trade relations and economic cooperation could only
come about as the result of good bilateral relations, and in
turn, trade relations help promote ties, he said.
</P>
<P>
Trade and economic cooperation helps the two countries to
reach common ground, narrow differences, and increase mutual
benefits and friendship, he said, and the expansion of trade and
economic cooperation will create a better environment for the
growth of healthy Sino-U.S. relations.

KUALA LUMPUR, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Work on the Trans-Asia
Railway from Singapore to Kunming, China, is expected to begin
soon after the region's economic recovery, Malaysian Transport
Minister Ling Liong Sik said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 5,513 kilometer long railway at an estimated cost of 1.5
billion ringgit (about 400 million U.S. dollars) was one of the
subjects he discussed in a meeting with a 20-member Vietnamese
government officers delegation here, Ling said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
There is already a railway link from Singapore to Bangkok via
Malaysia, he said, adding that in Vietnam there is a railway line
from Ho Chi Minh City in the south to Hanoi and on to Kunming,
China.
</P>
<P>
The missing link is between Phnom Penh in Cambodia and Ho Chi
Minh City, he said, adding "We have to build the stretch between
these two cities. In view of the economic slowdown we have to
wait."
</P>
<P>
He said that the feasibility report on the project which should
have been completed last year had to be postponed because of the
political problems in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Cambodia has since improved and work on the
project can now continue," he added.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu's Former Political Patron to Run for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Moshe Arens, former
political patron of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
announced on Monday that he will run against Netanyahu for the
leadership of the Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a news conference in Tel Aviv, Arens said that only
he can unite the Likud and lead the party to the victory in the
early elections scheduled on May 17.
</P>
<P>
Arens, who had served as a defense minister and foreign
minister in former Likud governments, said that he was against
the Oslo accord and the Wye agreement reached between Israel
and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that since the agreements have been signed,
both sides must fulfill their commitments.
</P>
<P>
Arens also asked the sitting Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
and Communications Minister Limor Livnat, who were also at odds
with Netanyahu over the peace process, to remain in the Likud.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, as the Israeli ambassador to Washington, Arens
appointed Netanyahu, then marketing director at the Rum furniture
company, as minister in the Israeli embassy there, thereby
becoming known in Israeli politics as Netanyahu's first political
patron.
</P>
<P>
But despite this personal relationship, Arens has been
critical over Netanyahu's handling of the Oslo accord. And the
signing of the Wye agreement last October motivated Arens to run
against Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The Likud primaries are scheduled for January 25. Arens
will thus join another party member Uzi Landau in challenging
Netanyahu for the Likud leadership.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Rejects Saudi Initiative on Sanction Lift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz said Monday that Iraq totally rejects a reported Saudi
initiative calling for lifting the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Iraqi News Agency, Aziz said that Saudi
Arabia is a partner in the recent U.S.-British aggression against
Iraq and it has remained so since 1990.
</P>
<P>
"It is not expected that Saudi Arabia comes with honest and
positive proposals for the interest of Iraq," the agency quoted
Aziz as saying.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting Sunday of foreign ministers of Arab Gulf nations,
a Gulf official said that Saudi Arabia will propose an initiative
on easing the sanctions to allow Iraq to food and medicine except
military equipment.
</P>
<P>
If approved by the Gulf states, and later by the Arab League,
the proposal will be presented to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq following its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990 and maintains that they will not be lifted unless
the U.N. Special Commission, which oversees Iraq's disarmament of
weapons of mass destruction, certifies that all the banned arms
have been eliminated.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched air strikes on Iraq for four
consecutive nights on December 16-19 with a declared aim of
punishing it for not cooperating with the weapons inspectors.

<P>
On Sunday, Iraq held Kuwait and Saudi Arabia accountable for
the property and human losses in the strikes because they allowed
the U.S. and Britain to use their space and bases for the
bombardment.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, what was leaked of information concerning the
so-called Saudi initiative accorded with British ideas submitted
in the U.N. galleries," said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Aziz added that the objective behind such ideas was to cover
the U.S.-British aggression and to impose new restrictions on Iraq
after the failure of their air strikes.
</P>
<P>
"If Saudi Arabia had a good intention, it would be better for
it to brief Iraq on such ideas rather than to circulate them in
dark galleries," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said "any Arab meeting that does not determine the
lifting of the embargo or condemn the U.S.-British aggression
will not be a genuine Arab meeting expressing the will of the
Arab Nation."
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of Arab League member states will meet on
January 24 to discuss a call for an Arab summit on Iraq following
U.S.-British air strikes.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Peso Closes at 9 Month High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine currency peso
Monday continued to strengthen, closing at 37.83 pesos against the
U.S. dollar, the highest rate since April 1998 when it stood at
37.82 pesos to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
This was following a similar appreciation of regional
currencies and a weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese
Yen and the Euro, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The success of the flotation of 1-billion-U.S. dollar worth of
Global bonds by the Philippines was also a contributor to the
rebound of the currency market, they said.
</P>
<P>
The appreciation of the peso was coupled by a decline in
Treasure bill rates and National Treasurer Leonor Briones
predicted a good year for the country.
</P>
<P>
But the analysts said the continuing appreciation of the peso
would damage the country's export competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said earlier that they expected the peso
to stand at 38 to 39 pesos against the U.S. dollar this year.

<HEADLINE> Blood Test Introduced At Chinese Winter Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, Jilin Province, January 11 (Xinhua) -- China will
introduce a blood test against doping offences in some of the
events at the Ninth National Winter Games, which opened on
Sunday, organizers announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We will adopt a new method of the blood test against doping
offences in the short track speed skating, cross-country and
biathlon at the games," Zhu Chengyi, deputy general secretry of
the games organizationg committee, said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The blood test is not a common dope-detecting method even in
the World Cup and the Olympics as it costs too much and the
cross-country becomes the only winter sport event adopting the
blood testing.
</P>
<P>
"More than 200 athletes will go through the blood tests during
the games," Zhu said, "and 151 samples have been tested prior to
the games, which features a total of 646 athletes, with no
positive results have been found.
</P>
<P>
"We have come to a pre-tournament agreement with every
delegation for a strict control of medicines and foods, and rec
eived promises from athletes for not using any
performance-enhancing drugs, including some controversial
prohibitions such as marijuana," Zhu added.

<HEADLINE> Peres Urges to Implement Oslo Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Former Israeli prime minister
Shimon Peres urged on Monday the parties concerned to speed up the
implementation of the Oslo Accord signed with the Palestinians in
1993.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Palestinian Council (PC) in Ramallah, Peres said
the Oslo Accord has laid down the framework for moving the Mideast
peace process forward and the accord must be fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
Peres, also a key Israeli parliament member from the opposition
Labor party, told the Palestinians that he supports the
Palestinians to establish their own independent state in the
territories.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis and Palestinians must live side by side in peace,
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Peres was leading the board of governors of the Peres Peace
Center to visit the PC on Monday as part of the planned program of
the center's three-day meeting which started in Tel Aviv on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Among those participating in the meeting included former
Soviet Union president Mikhail Gorbachev, South African Archbishop
Desmond Tutu, former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
Polish President Aleksander kwasniewski, Egyptian Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev also addressed the council meeting, urging Israelis
and Palestinians to solve their differences and move the process
forward.
</P>
<P>
The center, set up by Peres last year, was aimed at enhancing
peace in the region through economic development and cooperation
at the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Peres said last week that the Center has raised about 60
million U.S. dollars in 1998 and the money has to be well used in
promoting peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Besides helping the Palestinians to enhance their educational,
agricultural and technical development, the Center also plans
for the near future to form a Jordanian-Israeli fund to help
the Jordanians to speed up their economic development.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Continues to Climb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
continued its upward climb Monday, finishing the local session
stronger on the back of recent commodity price improvements and
continued positive fall-out from the introduction of the Euro
currency on January 1.
</P>
<P>
The local unit ended the day at 63.41 U.S. cents from its close
Friday of 63.22, after spending the day between 63.30 and 63.52
U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Colonial State Bank foreign exchange manager Peter Whitley said
the Australian currency was not only stronger but was holding onto
its gains.
</P>
<P>
Recent improvements in commodity prices were one of the factors
prompting the local currency gains, he said.
</P>
<P>
In New York overnight the Commodity Research Bureau index (CRB)
closed 1.25 points higher at 197.72. The CRB is an index of 17
U.S. futures markets and although not weighted to Australia's
exports, traders follow it as an indicator for the commodity
price-sensitive Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
The recent introduction of the Euro was also a main factor in
the stronger Australian dollar, Whitley said.
</P>
<P>
"A new currency has prompted a lot of people to adjust
portfolios for one reason or another," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It certainly has not hurt us - the Australian dollar has had a
good run last week and is holding on to its gains."
</P>
<P>
At the close of trading here the Australian currency was buying
0.5473 Euro from 0.5406 Friday, and finished trading at 70.13
Japanese yen from 70.12.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Expects More Japanese Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar hopes that more Japanese
investors and entrepreneurs, making good use of their financial
and human resources, will come to Myanmar in developing its rich
natural resources, a Myanmar diplomat was quoted by Monday's The
New Light of Myanmar newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
In his article, carried on the paper, L Zau Goone, Charge
d'Affaires of the Myanmar Embassy in Japan, pointed out that with
the drop in commodity prices and the surplus of skilled labor in
the region due to the present economic setback, opportunities
abound in Myanmar for investors, especially in the field of
natural gas and electric power in addition to the agro-based
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"Even though Japan is currently confronting its own economic
difficulties and political pressure from the West, it has made
enormous efforts to extend humanitarian assistance to the people
of Myanmar to elevate their livelihood," he said, appreciating the
Japanese efforts.
</P>
<P>
Japan, one of Myanmar's major donors, has extended to Myanmar
21 grants-in-aid for debt relief.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Japan's investment in Myanmar
reached 218.87 million dollars in 19 permitted projects at the end
of May last year, ranking the ninth among 23 countries or regions
which have a total of 7 billion dollars of investment in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Japan is also a major trading partner of Myanmar in Asia,
having its export of 360.46 million dollars to Myanmar and import
of 39.97 million dollars from Myanmar in the 1997-98 fiscal year,
favoring Japan in the balance of trade.

<HEADLINE> 20 Mafiosi Arrested in South Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Italian police arrested 20
suspected mafiosi Monday, including those allegedly responsible
for the January 2 massacre of five men in a cafe in Vittoria, a
town in the south of Sicily.
</P>
<P>
Police said that among those arrested, all of whom belonged to
the local Carbonaro-Dominante clan, were two mafiosi suspected of
ordering the Vittoria massacre.
</P>
<P>
The killers' main target, said police, was Angelo Mirabella.
He may have been eliminated from the clan because of his ruthless
climb to the top of the Mafia family after the clan was decimated
one year ago when 18 life sentences were handed down to clan
members by a local criminal court.
</P>
<P>
In the immediate aftermath of the shootings, investigators
became convinced that the deaths were a "clean-up" operation
between crime gangs.
</P>
<P>
Among the victims, however, two were confirmed by police as
fans of the local soccer team who just happened to be in the bar
at the wrong time. "The killers would have killed anyone in the
bar at that time," police said.
</P>
<P>
After the bloody massacre, the Italian government said last
Tuesday that it plans to shift police resources and promote more
effective legislation for the battle against organized crime.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Filming Of Rabe's Diary To Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Preparations began for a
Chinese film of Rabe's Diary as of today in east China's Jiangsu
Province,
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the script is expected to be
completed by May and filming to begin in September. The film will
be completed by April, 2000 and will be distributed to theaters
in China and abroad in May.
</P>
<P>
John D. Rabe was a representative of the Siemens Company in
the city of Nanjing when war broke out there and witnessed the
atrocities committed by the invading Japanese troops in 1937 and
recorded all of what he saw on a daily basis from September of
that year to the following February.
</P>
<P>
In that period, the Japanese troops slaughtered more than
300,000 civilians and unarmed soldiers in a nightmare that came
to be remembered as the "Nanjing Massacre".
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here today, Xie Jin, the film's
director, said that the film is being made not only for China but
for the rest of the world as well, because it describes a common
human predicament.
</P>
<P>
The diary has appeared in English, German, and Japanese, but
many details of the atrocities committed by the Japanese troops
were omitted in the Japanese edition. "This is totally
unacceptable," Xie says, "we must expose this immoral conduct."

<HEADLINE> Price of Romanian International Bonds Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BUCHAREST, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The price of international
bonds issued by Romania have started to increase in the
international capital market, said Rompres news agency quoting a
report by Merrill Lynch, a U.S. investment firm.
</P>
<P>
 After about two months of stagnation, the international
bonds issued by Romania have become more valuable. They have now
reached 86 percent of their nominal value.
</P>
<P>
 According to Rompres, Merrill Lynch has recommended that its
customers buy the bonds issued by Romania, They say the external
market's perception of Romania has changed lately.
</P>
<P>
 Progress in the process of privatization, the adoption of a
restructuring plan for Bancorex, including capitalization of
around 400 million U.S. dollars, efforts to sell the Petromidia
refinery, and the closing of unprofitable mines, could help
resolve doubts about Romania's development in 1999, the
investment company said.
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the market and foreign investors are waiting for
the results of negotiations, which are scheduled to be resumed
late in January, between Romanian authorities and the
International Monetary Fund's (IMF) delegation over a new loan
agreement. Credits to Romania from the World Bank and the
European Union (EU) also depend on the outcome of these
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
 Bonds in U.S. dollars, German marks and Japanese yen have
been issued until now by the National Bank of Romania, the
Ministry of Finance and the Romanian Commercial Bank in the
international capital market. The latest issuance, which occurred
in 1997, was for bonds worth 600 million German marks.

three-point lead at the top of the table.
</P>
<P>
They chalked up two firsts and a second place as many of these
high performance, two-man dinghies spent much of the day capsized.
</P>
<P>
Nicholson himself was not immune from the odd dunking in the
testing conditions, but for the most part his misfortunes
occurred while he wasn't racing.
</P>
<P>
In second place is fellow Australian Emmett Lazich and crew
Euan McNicoll, who were fourth, first and second on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Brothers John and Gary Boyd were also consistent with a first
and two second places to be level on points with Lazich, but
dropping to third on a tie-breaker.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Germans Big Winners at World Cup Swimming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Germany displayed what a
swimming power could do as the 10-strong squad grabbed eight gold
medals and five silver for a medal tally of 13 to top the final
medal table of the World Cup short-course series Hong Kong leg
which closed here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two-day event saw 17 of the world's best teams competing
for the 34 gold medals on offer. And at the end, 35 gold medals
were produced due to a tied first places in the women's 50 meters
freestyle final on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Denmark followed Germany with six gold, three silver and one
bronze medals for the second place on the table, followed by
Ukraine with a medal credit of 4-2-0 and China on 3-6-1.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine, fifth on the medal table with two gold and one silver
medals after the opening-day competitions, lifted its ranking to
the third, thanks to the fruitful efforts by Yana Klochkova. The
17-year-old Ukrainian, silver medalist for 400 meters individual
medley at last year's 50-meter-pool world championships in Perth,
Australia, won the women's 100 meters freestyle and finished
second in the 100 meters individual medley. And her teammate
Denys Sylantyev's victory in the men's 100 meters butterfly also
contributed to the rise of the overall standings.
</P>
<P>
A small-sized Chinese team with only six second-string
swimmers was less impressive here compared with a complete
domination by the hosts in the earlier Beijing leg of the 12-leg
World Cup series. But its team manager Shi Tianshu was happy
with such results. "The young swimmers had not had any real rest
after the Asian Games in Bangkok and their performance here is
fairly good considering their poor preparations for the Hong Kong
leg," he said.
</P>
<P>
Susan Rolph of Britain grabbed a total of three gold medals
and one silver from the two-day competitions to become the most
decorated swimmer here. But Ukrainians Sylantyev and Klochkova
obtained 987 and 960 points respectively and the two were named
the Hong Kong leg's Outstanding Swimmers.
</P>
<P>
Recovering from a headache caused by strong air-conditioning
in the hotel room, asthma-plagued Olympic champion Tom Dolan from
the United States added one more gold medal to his weekend
triumph as he took the men's 200 meters individual medley event.
He won the event in two minutes 2.79 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Dolan, who holds the long-course world record for men's 400
meters individual medley, said earlier that he would skip the
short-course world championships slated for April this year in
Hong Kong due to schedule clashes with the U.S. national
championships.
</P>
<P>
His other major event this year would be the Pan-Pacific
championships in August in Sydney, Australia, for which he had
already qualified.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican star Claudia Poll, Olympic champion in women's 200
meters freestyle and holder of short-course world records for
200- and 400-meter freestyle events, furthered her success story
here by taking women's 400 meters freestyle title on Sunday. She
won the 800 meters distance at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Swimmers from various parts of the world had taken different
approaches to the World Cup series. The Americans, as Dolan
earlier put it, took the 12-stop series as part of their ongoing
training, for both this year's national championships and the
Olympic Games next year in Sydney. This could be taken as that
it goes with their traditional focus on long-course (50 meters
pool) competitions.
</P>
<P>
But that was not the way for Claudia Poll, who took the Hong
Kong leg really serious as the national heroine of Costa Rica is
coming back here three months later for the short-course world
championships. She had revealed earlier that her other major
event this year would be the Pan-Pacific championships in August
in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The next and sixth stop of the World Cup series is slated for
Friday and Saturday in Sydney.

<HEADLINE> Centenarian Going Strong at End of 20th Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"My secret for longevity is family happiness," said the
106-year-old woman, who was sitting cross-legged on a bed in her
room. She had just got up after a nap at noon, and looked
refreshed with her white hair combed neatly behind her ears.
</P>
<P>
Having experienced more than 100 years of twists and turns,
Wei still recalls the hardest time in her life was when the
family business making homewoven cloth went bankrupt, like so
many other small businesses in China, after the Marco Polo Bridge
Incident on July 7, 1937, which triggered the War of Resistance
Against Japanese Aggression.
</P>
<P>
"My husband and I had to take our three children to live with
relatives or friends, first in Beijing and then in my home
province of Shandong," she said. But this hardworking and thrifty
life helped Wei perfect her household skills and in turn meant
that she enjoyed good health.
</P>
<P>
The five-member family had already started on its third
generation, when they finally moved back to Beijing after the
founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, according to
the Beijing Evening News.
</P>
<P>
Then Wei was given her current name Wei Zhongqing, as a
replacement for Xie Wei Shi (the first was her husband's family
name, and the second her own family name).
</P>
<P>
In 1979, one of Wei's daughters-in-law retired and took the
place of 87-year-old Wei as family hostess. Most unwillingly, Wei
had to give up cooking, because she just could not "adjust" to
modern cooking utensils.
</P>
<P>
"For me, a coal stove and an iron frying pan are enough for
cooking," said Wei.
</P>
<P>
The centenarian always eats simple food, and is not particular
in her diet. But she is very fond of deserts, especially
Misandao, a kind of sweet made from honey and flowers.
</P>
<P>
"I like the fun of people being together," said the
centenarian, "and we always have family gatherings and invite
friends to join us for dinner."

<HEADLINE> Security Sector to Have Testing on Computer 2000 Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- China's securities sector
plans to carry out another nationwide testing of their computer
networks to solve the year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
A circular issued today by the China Securities Regulatory
Commission (CSRC) requires that all business units in the
securities sector participate in the CSRC's third national
testing conducted to be a program from February 10-13 on the year
2000 computer bug.
</P>
<P>
With the approaching of the new millennium, the CSRC has
accelerated its effort to the 2000 problem, with two nationwide
tests of its computer networks already completed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the circular, securities and futures operators
have to rely on themselves to revise and test their systems,
including over-the-counter trading, market quotations, financial
management and office systems.
</P>
<P>
All operators must carry out test on sensitive dates such as
September 9, 1999 and January 1, 2000, to ensure that their
systems operate smoothly on these days.
</P>
<P>
They are also required to create testing and emergency plans
covering the entire process of account opening, trading and
settlements.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, January 11 (Xinhua)-- A recent survey carried out
by the Henan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions reveals that
the number of employees in non-state enterprises in 1996 reached
410,000, 14 times more than in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number in state-owned enterprises rose by 12
percent and that of township-level collective enterprises fell by
6.8 percent or 110,000, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
During the transition from the planned economic system to
market economy, Chinese people have been increasingly interested
in vacancies with foreign-funded or private enterprises. Under
the planned economic system, they were quite willing to work in
state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Li Yueming, a graduate of the Accounting Department of the
Henan Institute of Finance and Economics, is now busy looking for
a job. He admitted that for him and many of his classmates, the
first choice nowadays is no longer state-owned enterprises, but
either private, foreign-funded enterprises, or joint-stock
companies.
</P>
<P>
Good profits, flexible management, and high pay of such
enterprises are the main reasons for this change, although the
traditional medical care and pension schemes offered by
state-owned enterprises are still quite attractive to many
middle-aged staff.
</P>
<P>
Further research shows that the average age of employees in
private and foreign-funded enterprises is now 32.7, six years
younger than that of all the province's work force on the
payroll. And employees below 35 in such enterprises account for
53 percent of the total, compared with 50.4 percent of the
province's total.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Key Economic Sectors Record Low Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's three key sectors of
 manufacturing, mining and agriculture recorded declines in growth
last year, the Zimbabwean Finance Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
In its first monthly Treasury Bulletin released Sunday, the
ministry said the sectors were hit by cost-push inflationary
pressures largely due to the depreciation of the Zimbabwean
Dollar, which took a deep plunge against major currencies in the
last quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Herald daily newspaper Monday quoted the bulletin as saying
that although the agricultural sector was expected to record 3. 2
percent growth by the end of 1998 compared with 1.8 percent
achieved in 1997, production of major crops would decline.
</P>
<P>
"This growth comes from horticultural output which is expected
to grow by 27.7 percent and beef production which is expected to
increase by 30 percent," said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
However, it said maize production was expected to be down by 33
percent, sunflower 34 percent, cotton four percent and sorghum 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said manufacturing was stagnant in the first seven
months of 1998 as volume dropped by 0.8 percent while mineral
production decreased by seven percent compared with the same
period in previous years.
</P>
<P>
However, another key sector, tourism shot up 57.1 percent in
business volume due to an increase in international visitors.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean businesses last year struggled to survive a harsh
economic environment, characterized by high interest rates in the
region of 50 percent, soaring inflation now pegged at 45.1
percent, a weak currency and reduced demand on the domestic
market.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Historians Unravel Mystery of Ancient Dates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese historian has traced
the chronology of more than 3,000 years ago, pin-pointing the
exact dates of a well-known ancient war.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Xiaoyuan, a professor with Shanghai Astronomical
Observatory, confirmed that King Wu of the Zhou Dynasty (11
century B.C.- 221 B.C.) won a victory over King Zhou of the Shang
Dynasty (16 century B.C.- 11 century B.C.) on January 9, 1044
B.C., the Wenhui Daily reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Professor Jiang and his followers consulted the most advanced
astronomical database for their precise dating work, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
After strenuous study, they discovered the time of King Wu's
battle, which is academically highly valued by the state's
leading historians Li Xueqin and Xi Zezong.
</P>
<P>
Chinese historians were determined to find precise dates for
the Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasties which have been the basis for
abundant legends and anecdotes over many centuries. Their studies
focused on events some 2,800-4,000 years ago and resulted in an
accurate assessment of the three dynasties' lengths.
</P>
<P>
The existing historical chronicle for China, one of the
world's four ancient civilized nations, begins in 841 B.C., with
no precise record for nearly half of the nation's remote
history.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Revenue Collection Short of Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's revenue collection
during the first six months of the current July 1998-June 1999
fiscal year was short of the target by about 6.29 billion taka
(129.7 million U.S. dollars), an English newspaper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The revenue collection from July to December last year stood at
65.3 billion taka (1.35 billion dollars) against the target of
71.6 billion taka (1.48 billion dollars), sources were quoted by
The Independent as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government policy discouraging import to save the foreign
currency reserve, inadequate local production, fall in import of
raw materials and smuggling of Indian goods affected the revenue
collection, they explained.
</P>
<P>
Though the total volume of import during the first half of the
current fiscal year increased 4.4 percent over the total volume of
the corresponding period of the previous fiscal, revenue earning
was low as the volume mostly comprised of foodgrains which is
duty-free item, they said.
</P>
<P>
The country had to import a huge quantity of foodgrains with
much of its foreign currency to replenish the shortage of
foodgrains caused by last year's catastrophic floods. Therefore,
the government had to discourage import of other taxable items to
preserve the country's foreign exchange reserves, they added.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand PM to Visit Canada, US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley will kick-start her new year by paying a visit to
Ottawa and Washington.
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a busy few days, but I've been delighted at
the extent to which the Canadians and Americans want to use my
time to discuss both bilateral trade issues and my goals as chair
of APEC this year," Shipley said Monday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"It's vital to position APEC for the emerging signs of recovery
from the Asian crisis," she added in the statement.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand prime minister and her party are scheduled to
leave for Canada and the Unites States Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During her only one-day state visit to Canada, Shipley will
focus on a meeting with her host Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien and the key ministers responsible for APEC on January
13.
</P>
<P>
Her visit to Washington arose when U.S. Vice President Al Gore
invited her to be a keynote speaker at an international forum on
reinventing government. The forum will be chaired by Vice
President Gore on January 14-15.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand prime minister is unlikely to meet President
Bill Clinton or his wife during her stay in Washington, thanks to
the presidential impeachment.
</P>
<P>
However, Shipley will rub shoulders with her host Vice
President Gore during the forum.
</P>
<P>
In her statement, Shipley said she will meet Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and other U.S. Cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
"These meetings give us the opportunity to address APEC issues
including developing an adequate response to the Asian financial
crisis, ensuring that APEC members' food systems, border
management and electronic commerce issues are advanced together,
and promoting the free trade agenda," she said in the statement.

<HEADLINE> China Suspends Excavation of Qinshihuang Tombs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
decided to call a temporary halt to the excavation of a tomb
beside the grave of Qinshihuang, the country's first emperor.
</P>
<P>
Local archaeologists in northwestern Shaanxi Province stumbled
upon a suit of stone-made armor in the tomb, which dates back
more than 2,200 years, a couple of months ago.
</P>
<P>
After finding the giant armor, archaeological authorities in
the province, which is rich in cultural relics, announced that
they will suspend work on the excavation, a decision supported by
the State Administration of Cultural Heritage.
</P>
<P>
The experts believe that there should be better preparations
made for future complete excavation of the tomb, especially as
they have experienced great difficulties working in the cold
weather, according to a report in the Shanghai based Wenhui Daily.
</P>
<P>
Work is expected to resume early next year and the experts say
they have a rough idea about the size of the tomb and location of
a number of priceless cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists stunned the world 25 years ago with the
astonishing finds of armies of clay warriors and horses which
were buried with Qinshihuang, who unified China in 221 B.C.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Rubber Exports Said to Increase in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's rubber exports will
increase by at least five percent to 1.16 million tons this year
from 1.53 million tons in 1998, according to Indonesian Rubber
Association estimates.
</P>
<P>
But the association anticipates earning less foreign exchange
from the exports, with prices forecast to drop in the coming
months, the Jakarta Post daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The association's executive director A. Budiman said last
weekend that production would remain high this year, even though
rainfall was expected to be higher than last year.
</P>
<P>
However, he predicted that rubber export revenue would drop
slightly this year from 1.4 billion U.S. dollars recorded last
year due to falling international prices.
</P>
<P>
"Weakening prices will continue to drive down revenue raised
through Indonesia's rubber exports this year," Budiman said
without revealing the association's forecast for foreign exchange
earnings from rubber exports in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Rubber prices have slipped to a 30-year low of around 60 U.S.
cents a kilogram since the Asian financial crisis began in the
middle of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Rubber Foundation said earlier that the value of
rubber exports was expected to have dropped by over 20 percent
last year to 1.44 billion U.S. dollars from 1.83 billion dollars
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The foundation said that the slump in prices was due to
sluggish world demand for rubber products and the low price of
crude oil which made synthetic rubber products cheaper.
</P>
<P>
It also attributed the lower demand to the increased use of
recycled rubber in the United States, Europe, China and India.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Tourism Booms in Contrast to Other Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's tourism
revenues reached 17.6 billion U.S. dollars in 1998, an increase
of more than 14 percent compared to the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The booming tourism was in sharp contrast to other industries,
which all suffered slowdown in 1998, newspapers here reported.
</P>
<P>
The increase was attributed to a rise in domestic tourism,
which collected 11 billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government also launched a campaign to attract
foreign tourists. As a result, 5.53 million foreigners visited
the country last year, bringing in 6.6 billion dollars, an 85
percent increase over 1997.
</P>
<P>
With a possible economic recession in sight, Brazilian
officials and economists hope that the prosperous tourism would
pull the country out of the doldrums.

<HEADLINE> India Monitoring Euro for Reserves Composition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) is closely monitoring the developments in euro to see if it
needs to change the composition of reserves which has a high
proportion of U.S. dollars, official sources said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
It was imperative to see the movements in the new currency to
hold a higher amount of euro in the reserves, RBI officials said.
</P>
<P>
In case the euro appreciates against the U.S. dollar, it makes
eminent sense for RBI to reduce the dominance of the dollar in the
reserves, they said.
</P>
<P>
Usually the RBI holds currencies in its reserves in proportion
to the trade with the different countries. If exporters prefer to
invoice in the euro instead of the U.S. dollar, it will prompt the
RBI to hold more euros.
</P>
<P>
It was too early to take a view on whether to hold more euro.
The major factor the RBI will consider is the view that other
central banks take on the Euro. If they increase euro holdings, it
makes sense for the RBI to increase the holding in the new
currency, the official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The RBI will now automatically hold euros after the conversion.
Its holding in Deutsche mark, Italian lira and the currencies of
other countries opting for currency union, will automatically be
converted into the euro.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will hold a three-day
international leather fair in its capital Dhaka on January 27,
said an official press release here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The fair is being jointly organized by the Export Promotion
Bureau and the Bangladesh Finished Leather and Leather Goods
Exporters Association.
</P>
<P>
About a dozen foreign companies from India, Italy, Australia,
Singapore and Pakistan will participate in the fair.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 58 local companies will take part in the fair
to be visited by about 300 buyers who are expected to come up with
export orders.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 150 million square feet of hides are available on an
average annual basis in this South Asian country, but only some 15
percent of such hides are actually used by about 250 local
tanneries while the remaining 85 percent are exported, according
to estimates.
</P>
<P>
Leather exports from the country have been declining due to
acute fund crisis faced by the tanneries. Therefore, Bangladesh
lost export earnings from leather to the tune of 18 billion taka
(371 million U.S. dollars) in the last two and a half years.
</P>
<P>
The government has been urged to take measures to help the
leather sector, as tannery owners are confident enough to earn as
much as 50 billion taka (one billion dollars) from leather exports
as they have got all the potentials.

<HEADLINE> China to Increase Organic Tea Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 11 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to boost China's tea
exports, which lag behind other tea growing countries, experts
have called for increased production of the special "green"
organic tea, for which the country is renowned.
</P>
<P>
This particular tea is grown without the use of artificial
fertilizers or insecticides and many of China's tea plantations
are in remote mountainous areas which have retained traditional
agricultural methods, giving them an advantage in growing "green"
tea.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Zongmao, former director of the Tea Research
Institute under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, there are strict
international standards on the production and distribution of
this tea.
</P>
<P>
"The price of organic tea is usually 30 to 50 percent higher th
an the usual name brands on the international market and many
traditional tea plantation areas in China have favorable natural
conditions for cultivating organic tea." he added.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a few tea plantations in east China's Zhejiang
Province have been awarded production certificates from the
International Standards Organization to expand their output of
organic tea but so far it is still small scale.
</P>
<P>
Chen explained that increasing the crop of organic tea calls
for further development of the processing industry and advanced
packaging and marketing systems.

In addition, Vietnam's state bank has asked the Bank for
Agriculture and Rural Development to provide sufficient loans for
food companies to buy up about one million tons of reserve rice
between February 1 and March 31 to boost rice exports.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's rice exporters will be subsidized for part of their
interest payments as a further incentive and the money will come
from the Price Stabilizing Fund.
</P>
<P>
The past rate for broken rice of less than 25 percent was set
at one percent. It was set last October.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has planned to export 3.9 million tons of rice this
year, 100,000 tons more than last year when the country became the
world's second rice exporter. This year's first-quarter exports of
rice are expected to reach one million tons.

risks, following a fire Saturday that badly damaged the city's
largest lamp market.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xiaoyun, director of the Climate Center of Beijing
Meteorological Station told Xinhua today that his station is
cooperating with the Beijing Fire-Fighting Bureau and Beijing
People's Insurance Corporation to launch the program.
</P>
<P>
Wang, head of the program, said preparatory research has been c
ompleted and the program is expected to pass the appraisal of
fire experts later this month. The daily early warning will be
announced through the media.
</P>
<P>
No causalities were reported after the Saturday blaze that
damaged the Hualong Lamp Market. The cause of the fire and the
value of property losses are still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
A total of 42 fire engines and three ambulances rushed to the
scene after a "119" fire call was reported at 11:06 a.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Last May a massive blaze destroyed the Yuquanying Furniture
City, the largest of its kind in Beijing and resulted in losses
of over 2.4 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Private Car Purchases on the Rise in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Private ownership of cars in
China is surging and a recent survey shows that some 300,000
families across the country are expected to buy cars in the
coming two years while another three million more are considering
doing so in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Personal demand for cars rose by an average of 28.1 percent
over the past five years, and is expected to hit one million cars
annually by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The reform of the fee charging system on automobiles, which is
under heated discussion at the National People's Congress,
China's top legislature, will also pave the way for more private
car purchases in China as potential car owners will pay less.
</P>
<P>
Credit facilities and installment payments, which China's
commercial banks have promised to introduce, are expected to push
forward the car buying momentum.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted among 600 urban families in Beijing, by
the China Economic Climate Monitoring Center, says that well to
do families account for 11 percent of the population, families
that enjoy a relatively comfortable standard of living, 53
percent, and those that have adequate food and clothing, 34
percent.
</P>
<P>
The first category have put car purchase high on their
consumer agenda, and the second are expected to have similar
lifestyles and hopes within five to 10 years. This will spur on
the private car sector, making it maybe even the foremost market
for auto manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
However, economic experts warn that current loan facilities
aimed at the luxury car sector are beyond the range of ordinary
consumers, and stress that more economy-priced cars should be
built to meet market demand.

<HEADLINE> Over 100 Killed by Colombia's Ultra-right Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The ultra-right United
Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) killed at least 27
churchgoers in northern Magdalena province on Saturday, bringing
the number of deaths in the fresh attacks to over 113.
</P>
<P>
The latest incident took place in Playon de Orozco village
when the villagers were attending a baptismal mass in the local
church, Provincial police chief Octavio Grajales said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Alleged members of the AUC, a loose 5,000-strong alliance of
paramilitary gangs, raided the village and butchered the
churchgoers, including children on Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The AUC death squads have killed at least 113 people, who they
believe are sympathizers of the guerrilla group Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), in the northern provinces of
Antioquia, Sucre, Magdalena and two other provinces since
Thursday when the 18-day cease-fire they declared for Christmas
and New Year holidays ended.
</P>
<P>
Local and international human rights groups have been accusing
the AUC of receiving supports from the military and killing
leftists and suspected rebel sympathizers with impunity for more
than a decade.
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old conflict in Colombia has claimed more than
35,000 lives, mostly of civilians, over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
The FARC, which opened preliminary peace talks with the
government Thursday, is demanding the disbandment of the AUC
group.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Magway Division Reclaims Land for Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of hectares of vacant,
fallow and virgin land as well as wetlands in Myanmar's
northwestern Magway division have been reclaimed by local private
enterprises and cultivation of crops have started in the division
along with two others.
</P>
<P>
A total of nine private companies have been granted to engage
in over 75,700 hectares of such lands in different townships of
the division along with those in Yangon and Ayeyawaddy divisions.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government is encouraging domestic private
entrepreneurs to turn part of their investment in agriculture,
which is the mainstay of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar has formed a special group under the
Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation to assist the private
entrepreneurs to undertake the large-scale farming, disseminating
to them technology for the transformation efforts.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, in the 1997-98 fiscal year
fallow land in Myanmar came to 1.1 million hectares and cultivable
wasteland 7.89 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
The country expanded cultivated land under crops to 12.51
million hectares in the year, 185,540 hectares more than the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's paddy production fell from 19 million tons in 1995-96
fiscal year to 17.66 million tons in 1996-97 and then to 17.3
million tons in 1997-98 with its rice exports reducing from
354,000 tons to 93,100 tons and then to 28,300 tons
correspondingly.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the country's population is estimated to
have reached 46.4 million in 1997-98, growing by 1.84 percent
annually.
</P>
<P>
In view of these facts, Myanmar is adopting the above-mentioned
measures of reclamation of more land for cultivation.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's agriculture, accounting for 36 percent of the gross
domestic product and 35 percent of the exports in value, grew by
2.9 percent in output value in the fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Give State of Union Address as Scheduled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will give his State of the Union address to Congress and the
nation in mid-January despite calls that he postpone it because
of his impeachment trial, a White House spokesman said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The president looks forward to delivering the State of the
Union address on January 19th," James Kennedy said, adding that
"we have no intention of being diverted from addressing the
issues that are important to the country."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, stands
accused of two articles of impeachment -- perjury and obstruction
of justice, in connection with his effort to conceal a sexual
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. He
is the second president in U.S. history to be subjected to a
trial, after Andrew Johnson in 1868.
</P>
<P>
With his impeachment trial set to resume on January 14,
Clinton faces the daunting challenge of addressing a joint
session of Congress on January 19 in the midst of Senate
proceeding into whether he should be removed from office on the
charges stemming from his affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Many Republicans have called for a delay, although Senator
Susan Collins said the timing should be driven by circumstances.
If the Senate was "almost to the conclusion of the trial, the
president should wait. If it looks like it's going to be a longer
period than anticipated, then he should go ahead," she said.
</P>
<P>
Several Democrats also joined Republicans Sunday in urging
Clinton to either delay the speech or submit it as a written
report instead.
</P>
<P>
However, Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle defended
Clinton's decision, saying "the business of the country still
must go on, even if the trial is under way."
</P>
<P>
"It will be uncomfortable clearly, but I don't see any other
real option... Let's get on with the business. This is important,
but so is running the country," Daschle said on CBS's "Face the
Nation."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Constitution requires a president to present Congress
annually with a status report on the nation. It first was
submitted in writing but, since the days of President Woodrow
Wilson, has been a formal address.

<HEADLINE> Mandela to Mediate in Sri Lanka's Civil War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 11 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela has informed the Sri Lankan government that he would be
happy to mediate in Sri Lanka's ethnic crisis, official sources
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has accepted the offer and on her recent visit to
India discussed the matter with Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee and won his support.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government has accepted the Mandela offer in
preference to fourteen other international offers to mediate in
the country's ethnic crisis here, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said South Africa's foreign minister will be in Sri
Lanka in due course to map out the basis on which South Africa
could serve as the facilitator in bringing the two warring parties
back to the negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said Mandela's offer has been accepted as South
Africa is seen as an independent force with a genuine interest in
seeing an end to the country's ongoing war.
</P>
<P>
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) that has been
fighting for a separate state since 1983 recently indicated it was
willing to enter into negotiations with the government through
third-party mediation.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the LTTE too favored the Mandela intervention.

<HEADLINE> Analysis: Farming Sector Has Potential for Overseas Investors (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- China's farming sector has a
huge profit potential although overseas investment lags far
behind the national average enjoyed in other sectors.
</P>
<P>
China's reform was first introduced in the countryside 20
years ago, but overseas investment in the farming industry still
only accounts for a tiny portion of the overall foreign
investment in China.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, the number of foreign-invested projects in
the farming sector had reached only 7,896, with a contractual inv
estment volume of 8.2 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for 1.5
percent of the nation's total.
</P>
<P>
At a recent national conference focused on rural development,
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
decided that economic growth in the sector should incorporate
high quality and efficiency by making use of favorable
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that the CPC's new thinking will enable high
profit-making opportunities for overseas investors in the farming
sector.
</P>
<P>
Lu Mai, a scholar with the Development Research Center of the
State Council, said, "Apart from the financial input, the
advantages and benefits which foreign investors bring to this
sector include entrepreneurial skills which, in general, Chinese
farmers lack.
</P>
<P>
Using such abilities an overseas investor can rapidly
establish a working company in the Chinese countryside and make
profits," he concluded.
</P>
<P>
The Chia Tai Group of Thailand and the Kam Kowong Group of
Indonesia, for instance, achieved success in their investment in
China's farming sector not because of their advanced technology
or equipment, but largely because of their management and sales
skills, Lu pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Analysis: Farming Sector Has Potential for Overseas Investors (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lu said the reason so few foreign-invested agricultural
companies were established is mainly due to China's small scale
peasant economy. Costs are high for working with a large number
of scattered farms in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, relevant policies have yet to be improved and
the existing regulations make it difficult to reduce the cost of
investment," Lu noted.
</P>
<P>
However, another well known Chinese agricultural expert, Wang
Wenxue, said that this does not necessarily mean that investment
in the farming sector will not generate profits.
</P>
<P>
Wang said, "So long as China's overall economy keeps
expanding, and national incomes rise constantly, there are good
opportunities for foreign investors to enjoy success in the
country's farming sector.
</P>
<P>
The price of rural labor and land is very low, there are
plentiful farm species and the climatic situation varies
remarkably from region to region," he added. "China's huge
population, whose income is increasing and who spend nearly half
of it on food, can almost guarantee that profits can be realized
from investing in farming."
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by the Development Research Center
of the State Council and the China Association of International
Agricultural Cooperation Promotion shows that two-thirds of
overseas-invested farm ventures in China have broken even or made
profits. Ironically, that is a higher percentage than the
national average for foreign-funded ventures all over China.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in China's farming sector was first
introduced in the early 1980s, and grew very slowly until 1988.
Most ventures are small-scale ones involving less than 500,000
U.S. dollars each and the majority are focused on fishing, animal
breeding, and forestry. About 70 percent are located in the five
coastal provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, Shandong, Liaoning and
Jiangsu.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Develop Fruit Trees, Fruit Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam plans to have 710,000
hectares of fruit trees and export 130,000 tons of fruits by
2005, Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A project proposed to develop fruit trees from now to the year
2005 has been formulated by Vietnam's Ministry of Agriculture and
Rural Development.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, about 320,000 more hectares will be put
under fruit trees, raising the country's total fruit tree acreage
to 710,000 hectares by 2005, thus enabling Vietnam to export
130,000 tons of assorted fruits a year, including 20,000 tons of
fresh fruits.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's domestic consumption of fresh fruit will also
increase from 38 kilograms per person per year at present to 80
kg.
</P>
<P>
Main fruits to be developed under the project include longan,
mango, litchi, orange, mandarin orange and grapefruit.
</P>
<P>
Large areas in Vietnam's northern midland and mountainous
provinces of Thai Nguyen, Phu Tho, Yen Bai, Bac Giang and Thanh
Hoa central province, and Tien Giang and Binh Phuoc provinces in
the south will be zoned for growing these fruits.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, about 60 million U.S. dollars will be
invested in the construction of 3,000 packaging establishments and
freezing and storage systems.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam now has 20 vegetables and fruit processing factories
with a combined capacity of more than 100,000 tons per year. These
factories with backward technologies are located far away from
materials areas. They process around 10 percent of Vietnam's total
fruit output.
</P>
<P>
In the coming years, the vegetable and fruit sector will focus
investment on construction of many medium- and small-sized
processing establishments with a combined designed capacity of
700,000 tons a year. Some major processing factories capable of
processing 100,000 tons a year will be built in materials
concentrated areas.
</P>
<P>
Total cost for the project to develop fruit trees growing and
processing technology to the year 2005 is estimated at about 700
million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Thai Exports to Grow Four Percent This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports are expected
to grow four percent to 56.6 billion U.S. dollars this year
compared with 54.5 billion U.S. dollars last year, Deputy Commerce
Minister Pravit Rattanapien said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The anticipated exports figure this year would be very close to
the 55.9 billion U.S. dollars exports value registered in 1996,
the year when Thailand began to experience a slowdown in growth,
Pravit said.
</P>
<P>
The exports estimation this year was conservative and based on
views expressed by several exporters and overseas-based Thai
commercial attaches, Pravit was quoted Monday by the Bangkok Post
as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the estimation was close to the figures anticipated by
both the International Monetary Fund and the National Economic and
Social Development Board. Both agencies predicted that Thai
exports would reach 56.1 billion U.S. dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Attributing the anticipated four percent growth are the
prospects of a global economic recovery which will spur
international trade, said Pravit, adding that Thai products would
be able to command market shares in the U.S. and European markets.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that three obstacles needed to be addressed
to spur exports. These include import tax restructuring, a cutback
in expenses related to exports and securing new markets for Thai
exports.
</P>
<P>
He said a panel would be set up to monitor exports and to
follow up market trends on a monthly basis.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Election Bill to Deprive Non-voters of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's government and a
group of academics have worked out a draft election bill which
would deprive eligible voters of three rights if they fail to vote
during elections.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, penalized voters would lose their rights to be
appointed to a local election committee, to sit on an overseas
election panel if the eligible voters are abroad, and to lodge
complaints about election results, government sources confirmed
press reports Monday.
</P>
<P>
A resolution has recently been reached over the penalty for
those who refuse to vote. The proposed penalty did not go against
the Constitution, the sources said, requesting anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the government, citing Article 23 of the Constitution,
had proposed that the Election Commission of Thailand determine
the penalty for those who fail to exercise their voting right.
Government officials said the penalty was very lenient and would
not affect the voters.
</P>
<P>
Thiwa Ngernyuang, a Democrat law expert, said there should be a
special law that can take away errant voters' rights, therefore it
was necessary to propose election law amendments bills to
parliament.
</P>
<P>
But the Constitutional Court had ruled that the Election
Commission had no power to deprive the voters of any rights they
enjoy under the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
There was also a suggestion that a fine should be imposed on
errant eligible voters. But opponents said this could not be done
because it went against the Constitution which states that the
penalty must be in the form of the deprivation of rights.

WASHINGTON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Tom Welch, the former

Olympics.
</P>
<P>
According to a local press report, Welch acknowledged cash
payments and gifts to IOC members, but called them contributions
to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We made contributions out there as a part of the
Olympic family, as an obligation we have. It was the responsible
thing to do."
</P>
<P>
Welch admitted giving $50,000 cash to Jean-Claude Ganga, an
IOC member from the Republic of Congo. Ganga sought the money to
help children in the African nation ravaged by civil strife.
</P>
<P>
"That's where I think the money went," Welch said.
</P>
<P>
He also acknowledged the bid committee made a $10,000
contribution to the campaign of Children IOC member Sergio
Santander Fantini, who was running for mayor of Santigo.
</P>
<P>
Welch resigned from the post in 1997 after spousal abuse.

BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- China plans to increase the
salaries of scientists and professors to 100,000 yuan (12,000
U.S. dollars) annually, still poor compared with western
countries, but three times their current pay.
</P>
<P>
Today's overseas edition of People's Daily said the first

According to today's Wenhui Daily, the project will persuade a
lot of overseas Chinese scientists to work in Chinese
universities. An official of Beijing University was quoted as
saying that more than 40 scientists have applied for the
available nine posts.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said more than half of the scientists applying
to return work in foreign countries and are much higher paid. But
their patriotism and the improving research environment in China
are factors drawing them back to the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Credit Ratings to Be Revised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 11 (Xinhua) -- International credit rating
agencies are expected to revise Thailand's sovereign ratings by
mid-year in a major move that would guide the country's future
investments, finance ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
Moody's Investors Service now gives Thailand a "Ba1" rating,
just below investment grade status, while Standard and Poor's has
maintained a "BBB" grade, one step above the investment grade
threshold.
</P>
<P>
Both agencies are expected to announce their findings in June.
With financial markets still volatile and the regional economic
outlook uncertain, ratings agencies can be expected to revise
their forecasts each six months. During the economic boom, a
ratings review would come once every two years, said the
officials, quoted by Monday's Bangkok Post.
</P>
<P>
In December, officials from the two ratings agencies visited
Thailand to gather information on the economy and government
efforts to lead the country out of its worst recession in decades.
</P>
<P>
Financial markets and investors rely heavily on international
ratings agencies in pricing debt issues. Highly-rated countries,
with little risk of default, pay less to borrow from the
international capital markets.
</P>
<P>
Political factors would also be important in reassessing the
country's credit risk.

<HEADLINE> Peking Opera Festival Closed with Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- China's Second National Peking
Opera Festival closed here Sunday after 12 days of competition.
</P>
<P>
It was hailed as a "complete success" by Pan Zhenzhou,
vice-minister of culture, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Culture Sun Jiazheng expressed confidence over
revitalization of Peking Opera, which is considered as an
outstanding representative of the Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
"This festival makes me even more confident," Sun was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Experiments of combining this old Chinese artistic form with
modern stories proved successful in this festival, Sun said. "Our
working principle is to keep the traditional art's path, while
reforming its bravely," he added.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the festival is not to appraise and award, but to
push forward the development of Peking Opera by attracting
people's attention, Sun stressed, urging theaters to present
their plays to local audiences as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
The Jiangsu Peking Opera Theater with the opera "The Rickshow
Boy", and Beijing Peking Opera Theater with the opera "Legends of
Tongrentang," won the top award of the Festival, the Golden
Chrysanthemum Award.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Imports Predicted to Rise 40 Pct in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's imports this year
are predicted to increase by 40 percent from the 1998 figure, but
would be still lower than the 1997 value which reached 46 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Imported goods would be dominated by industrial raw materials,
foods, and capital goods, said Amirudin Saud, chairman of the
Indonesian Importers Association (Ginsi).
</P>
<P>
"Although this year we will deal with important political
events like the general election and the general meeting of the
People's Consultative Assembly, it is likely that the import of
goods in 1999 will rise by 40 percent to 32.2 billion U.S.
dollars," he was quoted by the Indonesian Observer Monday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, if riots followed by looting happened again
like last year, "it could discourage importers to do their
businesses because of the disturbance to the distribution system."
</P>
<P>
The imports of goods in the last couple of months have been
increasing significantly following the rising demand during the
festivities of Christmas, Chinese Lunar Year and Idul Fitri (feast
celebrating the end of fasting period).
</P>
<P>
In January 1999, Ginsi's members have signed contracts to
purchase 30,000 tons of soybean from the U.S., 30,000 tons of
sugar from the U.S., the Philippines, Brazil and Thailand, and
around 5,000 tons of wheat from the U.S., he added.

<HEADLINE> Blair Supports Foreign Minister in Sex Allegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair expressed his full support on Sunday to Foreign Minister
Robin Cook who faces a sex and drinking allegation.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with BBC, Blair said stories in Sunday's
papers were "a whole lot of nonsense."
</P>
<P>
In a newly published book which was serialized in the Sunday
Times, Cook's ex-wife Margaret Cook accused the foreign secretary
of having several love affairs before leaving her for his
secretary Gaynor Regan -- the woman he married after his divorce
last year. She also claimed Cook had a habit of drinking heavily.
</P>
<P>
Blair denied that the new claims against the foreign secretary
damaged the dignity of his office and described him as "the most
respected foreign minister in the rest of Europe that we've had
for years and years and years".
</P>
<P>
"I have every confidence in the job he does," Blair said,
adding that "if you go through any big corporation" employees had
problems in their private lives that did not affect the way they
carried out their jobs."
</P>
<P>
Rounding on the media, he said the government should be judged
on its ability to deliver on election pledges, not "scandal,
gossip and trivia."
</P>
<P>
"If we haven't delivered by the next election, judge us on
that. Judge us on the things that really matter," he said.

<HEADLINE> Computer Network Poses New Threat to Security: Article </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Cybercrimes, including
stealing confidential technological ad economic information,
spreading pornography on the Web and hacking into public
networks, are on the rise in China and pose a grave threat to the
national security, according to a Beijing-based magazine.
</P>
<P>
In its recent issue, the "Outlook Weekly" said that although
accurate figures for computer crimes are not yet available, "it
is clear that the number is on the rise."
</P>
<P>
"Cybercrimes can damage the normal economic order and threaten
national security, and the government should take steps to deal
with it," the weekly urged.
</P>
<P>
The illegal activities have severely damaged the State's
banking network, it said, noting that the most harmful computer
crime in recent years cost 21 million yuan (2.5 million U.S.
dollars), and over 180 cases related to computer crimes have been
handled so far.
</P>
<P>
Lack of effective protection makes the country's national
computer networks increasingly vulnerable to outside attack, said
the article.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Security found the situation
disquieting after examining the computer security system network
in the State's banking, government and public networks in 1996.
Measures to prevent outside attacks are absent in most of the
computers serving in the nation's securities exchanges, according
to the magazine,
</P>
<P>
Even worse, the Internet presents new challenges for law
enforcement, commented the magazine. As cybercrimes are conducted
in an intangible, electronic environment and thus no longer
subject to traditional rules and constraints, the abuses create
unique problems for law enforcement, it said.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has no specific law combating cybercrime, though
the revised Criminal Law, coming into effect in October 1997,
contains articles concerning computer crimes.
</P>
<P>
To ensure a safe and clean national information network, China
and the international community still have a long way to go, the
weekly said.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Case of Psychoactive Drug Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese customs officers said
today they seized 880,000 tablets of amfepramone, a psychoactive
drug, in a recent two-day operation at Horgos, a city on the
border with Kazakstan.
</P>
<P>
According to them, it is the largest case of psychoactive drug
smuggling ever uncovered. The Horgos branch of the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region's Urumqi Customs discovered 720,000 pills in
the luggage of three citizens of Kazakstan when they passed
through customs in mid-December.
</P>
<P>
Amfepramone is under strict control in China. Extended use of
the drug can damage the health and lead to addiction.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Wang Liqin Wins Men's Singles Title in ITTF Pro-Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 11 (Xinhua) -- China's Wang Liqin served notice
that he will be the man to beat in men's table tennis in the next
few years by toppling Olympic champion and his teammate Liu
Guoliang to take the ITTF Pro-Tour title here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The in-form 20-year-old, who remained unbeaten both in singles
and doubles at the tournament, overcame a first set slump to kill
the match 18-21, 21-13, 21-13, 21-15.
</P>
<P>
"I lost to Belarus' Vladimir Samsonov here last year for lack
of experience, and I'm pleased with my performances this year."
Wang, the best of the new generation of China's table tennis
players, told the packed crowd at the stadium.
</P>
<P>
Liu, who had been tipped for the title after ousting world
champion Jan-ove Waldner of Sweden in Saturday's semi-finals,
said he played well but Wang even better.
</P>
<P>
In the women's final, Asian Games champion and world number
three Wan Nan labored to beat her compatriot Lin Ling, ranked
17th in the world, in a 21-23, 21-18, 19-21, 22-20, 21-9 five-set
thriller.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Sunday, Wang Liqin and Yan Sen beat Ma Lin and Qin
Zhijian 25-23, 21-12, 17-21, 21-18 to take the men's doubles
title. The women's doubles title also went to China Saturday with
Li Ju and Wang Nan the champions.
</P>
<P>
The 220,000-dollar competition, which concluded here today,
saw a Chinese clean sweep of gold and silver medals in all four
events, which according to China's head coach Cai Zhenhua, "has
brought considerable psychological pressure for European players
before the Belgrade world championships in April."
</P>
<P>
"It's a marvelous rehearsal for our boys and girls ahead of
the Belgrade worlds, and I think Europeans will be suffering
psychologically," Cai told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The event, billed as table tennis' equivalent to the ATP
tennis' world championship finals, attracted the best 16 men and
women players from 11 international tournaments between February
and November last year.

<HEADLINE> Young Imams Becoming More Active in Beijing's Mosques </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Yin Guofang, a 36-year-old
ahung, or imam, keeps busy at the Niujie Mosque, the largest
mosque in the Chinese capital, at his regular religious services
and presiding over weddings and funerals for the area's Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Yin is a major part of the mosque, according to Xia Qi,
chairman of the administrative committee of the mosque and a
vice-chairman of the Islamic Association of Xuanwu District,
where the mosque is located.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has 68 mosques, with 104 ahungs, half of them below
the age of 40. There are very few middle-aged imams because
mosques here were closed for several decades until 1978, when
China began its reforms and opening up, allowing religious
activities again.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Yin became one of the city's first young Muslims to
study at its Quran Study Institute, where they received a more
complete education about Islam than the older generation of
ahungs, he said.
</P>
<P>
For five years, Yin and his classmates got their schooling at
local mosques, attending eight classes and five religious
services a day. They had lessons on the Quran and Islamic
teachings and religion, Islamic Law, and Arabic language taught
by older imams like An Shiwei, the late chairman of the China
Islamic Association.
</P>
<P>
In the past two decades, a large number of Muslim students
have graduated from the Beijing Religious Studies Institute and
the China Religious Studies Institute, and more recently the two
schools have sent some of their teachers to study abroad to
improve their professional standing. Students can get financial
assistance from the schools.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma Huisheng of the China Islamic Association,
China has nine religious institutes in various parts of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Task Force Unveils Community Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Football Task Force will
publish plans to enable top clubs to invest millions of pounds in
developing the game at grassroots level on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Investing In The Community" is the first report by English
football's watchdog, chaired by former government minister David
Mellor, since it was set up 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
The report, to be officially unveiled in London, says the
future of the game depends on fair redistribution of the wealth
generated by the FA Premier League.
</P>
<P>
An agreement has been reached which will see 5% of the money
raised from the next Premiership television deal being invested
in better facilities for community football.
</P>
<P>
The sum could be as much as 50m, but the proposal now has to
go before the government for consideration.
</P>
<P>
Publication of the report follows the resignation of player's
union chief executive Gordon Taylor from the Task Force after he
was not invited to the launch.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Task Force administration assistant David
Mahoney, Taylor stated that his union "initiated the Football
Club and community Programme in 1986, and also it is current
players and former players who are directly involved in the
programme".
</P>
<P>
He outlined how the PFA "makes a direct contribution of
500,000 per year (3m in total) since 1992 to the programme".
</P>
<P>
Taylor added: "In your press release, reference is made to
'promoting footballers as role models and helping increase their
participation in community schemes'.
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would have been self-evident to include their
Association and consider it a disrespectful snub.
</P>
<P>
"A similar snub has been directed at the Footballers' Further
Education Society, who are the administrators of the programme
and who have also not been invited to attend.
</P>
<P>
"The above treatment illustrates the vindictiveness shown by
the chairman of the Task Force towards players and the PFA, and
this has given me no alternative but to resign from the Task
Force and disassociate the PFA from any of its findings.
</P>
<P>
"Also, bearing in mind the Football Trust has provided the
secretariat for the Task Force, I shall be reconsidering with my
Management Committee our membership of the Trust."

<HEADLINE> Gazza Attacks Foreign Stars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Paul Gascoigne has stirred up
controversy by speaking out against foreign stars playing in the
FA Premiership.
</P>
<P>
The Middlesbrough midfielder said he had no sympathy for
foreign players who complain about the number of matches they are
expected to play in English football.
</P>
<P>
He told BBC TV's Match of the Day: "I don't hear our 34 or
35-year-olds saying that. I don't hear Andy Townsend saying we
are playing too much. Sometimes he can't get enough football
because it is a great game and the supporters pay good money.
</P>
<P>
"They are saying they need rest or going AWOL or on strike. I
can't see the point of that. It is our league, our English league
and I don't like it one bit."
</P>
<P>
Gascoigne, who is still trying to regain full fitness after
problems with drink and stress, made his remarks following
Middlesbrough's 0-0 draw with Aston Villa on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He voiced pleasure at the number of talented "English"
youngsters appearing in the Premiership.
</P>
<P>
"I get so proud to see young kids coming through and doing
well for the country. I don't like the foreign lads coming in and
moaning. 'The league's too long' or they need more days off and
returning home.
</P>
<P>
"It is none of my business but they are foreign lads coming
into the English game and they should respect the English game
and not complain about playing too much," Gascoigne added.
</P>
<P>
He is still hoping to revive his England career after being
excluded from Glenn Hoddle's squad for last summer's World Cup
finals.
</P>
<P>
"I have played some good games for Middlesbrough and some bad
ones. But as long as I can give 110 per cent, then there's
nothing wrong with that," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The England situation is in Hoddle's hands. If I get picked
for England I do, and if I don't I don't. As long as I keep
enjoying playing for Middlesbrough it will be fine, but it would
be good to have a farewell game for England, for the fans, " he
added.

<HEADLINE> Manchester United Beat West Ham </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Two goals from Dwight Yorke and
Andy Cole each gave the Manchester United a 4-1 victory over West
Ham United at the English Premier League on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
With the win, Manchester United moved up to the third place at
the team standings.
</P>
<P>
Yorke shot United ahead after 10 minutes following a Cole pass
and Cole made it 2-0 in the 40th minute after Nicky Butt's shot
came back off a post.
</P>
<P>
Yorke returned the compliment in the 68th minute, feeding Cole
who coolly slotted home.
</P>
<P>
The two strikers, who have struck up a deadly partnership
since Yorke's arrival from Aston Villa in the summer, have now
notched 13 goals each this season.
</P>
<P>
In a game that kicked off 45 minutes late because of a
floodlight failure, United were never troubled and completed a
one-sided victory 10 minutes from time when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer
headed into an empty net moments after coming on as substitute.
</P>
<P>
The only bright spot for the visitors was an encouraging
performance by 17-year-old midfielder Joe Cole, who came on for
the second half to make a confident league debut.
</P>
<P>
Frank Lampard scored a consolation goal for West Ham in the
dying moments of the game.
</P>
<P>
The victory lifted United above Arsenal to third place, two
points behind Aston Villa and Chelsea, who top the standings on
goal difference.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea beat Newcastle United 1-0 away on Saturday while Villa
lost top spot after drawing 0-0 at Middlesbrough.

<HEADLINE> Cote d'Ivoire, Togolese Ministers Mediate on S. </HEADLINE>

<P>
LAGOS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Cote d'Ivoire Foreign Minister
Amara Essy and Togolese Foreign Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh
arrived in Conakry, capital of Guinea, Sunday on a mission of
mediation on Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
They would have talks with President Lansana Conte and fly on
Monday to Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone, to meet the two
parties of the conflict in that country, according to a report
reaching here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Togo currently chairs the 16-nation Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) which provides the mandate for the west
African peacekeeping force ECOMOG in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Following rebels' attacks on Freetown last Wednesday, Sierra
Leone President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah reached a seven-day ceasefire
agreement Thursday with the jailed leader of the Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) Foday Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
However, Field Commander of the RUF Sam Bockarie rejected the
agreement, saying he would continue his offensive against the
ECOMOG until Sankoh is freed from detention.
</P>
<P>
He has pledged to press his offensive against the Lungi
International Airport complex where Kabbah and senior government
officials have taken refuge.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the rebels which hold the east and central parts
of the capital city threatened to launch a renewed attack on the
west end of Freetown which is still in the control of ECOMOG
troops backing Kabbah's democratically-elected government.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG sent several hundreds of reinforcement troops on
Sunday to Sierra Leone to prepare for a counter-attack on the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Cote d'Ivoire Foreign Minister told reporters Saturday that
"both President Kabbah and the leaders of the Revolutionary United
Front have asked me" to mediate.

JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
reiterated here on Sunday that Israel will not allow the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to declare an independent
state in May this year.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told a weekly cabinet meeting that the Israeli
government intents to implement its decision concerning Israel's
response to an unilateral declaration of Palestinian statehood or
the division of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
PNA President Yasser Arafat said in the past that PNA has
the right to declare an independent state in May this year
with Jerusalem as its capital when the five-year interim period
of the Oslo Accord expires. Netanyahu said in response that
Israel will annex the part of the West Bank now under Israeli
control if the PNA does that. (BC-Israel-Palestinian state)

BAGHDAD -- Iraqi National Assembly (parliament) held the
Kuwaiti and Saudi authorities responsible for the material and
human losses resulted from the recent U.S.-British air strikes
against the country.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly stressed in a resolution adopted Sunday
at the conclusion of its extraordinary session that Iraq would
preserve its rights for compensation for the damages.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait was the victim of Iraq's 1990 invasion and had thus been
willing to see President Saddam Hussein being bombed. Saudi
Arabia, which has a defense pact with the U.S., allowed its
territory to be used for attacks against Iraq.

BAGHDAD -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf said
at a press conference here on Sunday that United States and
Britain were using the United Nations Security Council and Saudi
Arabia and kuwait in committing aggression against Iraq on December
16-19.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries view the United Nations
Security Council as a pair of shoes, when they like it, they put
on them and when they do not like it they take off.

<HEADLINE> Migraine Sufferers May Be at Greater Risk of Having Stroke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Women who get migraines are
at greater risk of having a stroke than whose who do not,
according to a study published recently in the British Medical
Journal.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from Imperial College School of Medicine in London
and the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford have found that young women
with a history of migraines are 3.5 times more likely to have an
ischemic stroke, which is caused by a lack of blood to the brain
due to constriction or blockage in blood vessel.
</P>
<P>
After studying 291 women ages 20 to 44 who had had strokes, the
scientists found the risk is even higher if the woman smokes, has
high blood pressure or uses oral contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
They said that from 20 to 40 percent of strokes in women with a
migraine history seemed to stem directly from a migraine attack.
