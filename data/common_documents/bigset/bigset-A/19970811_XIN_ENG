<HEADLINE> KAL Crash Survivors Suffer From Psychological Disorders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Some of the survivors of the
crashed Korean Air Flight 801 in Guam, who have returned here for
medical treatment, suffer from severe psychological disorders
which could persist for an indefinite period, doctors said today.
</P>
<P>
"About 70 percent of the survivors face a wide spectrum of
symptoms such as psychological unrest, mood swings, memory loss
and other problems," said Kim Kwang-il, a doctor at Hanyang
University Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Kim said that some patients suffer from despair, frustration and
deep remorse for a long period which could result in nervous
breakdowns, melancholia and even suicide.
</P>
<P>
Only 27 people survived after the Boeing 747 carrying 254
passengers and crew members crashed into a rocky hill near Guam's
Agana International Airport on August 6.
</P>
<P>
KAL survivors have been stricken with sorrow and the burden
when they found their relatives, friends or family members were
killed in the crash, said doctors.
</P>
<P>
Lee Chae-nam, 43, who lost her son, daughter and husband in the
crash, refused to meet with her relatives. He was transferred to the
Samsung Medical Center in southern Seoul Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
Covering her face with a handkerchief, Lee cried, "I don't want
to meet my relatives. Leave me alone."
</P>
<P>
Lee Chang-woo, 29, said he couldn't close his eyes because of
the terrible image of darkness and the downed plane. He lost three
friends in the disaster.
</P>
<P>
Son Sun-nyo, 23, who suffers from severe burns, is troubled by
horrible memories and nightmares.
</P>
<P>
Hong Hyon-sung, 36, who escaped with slight injuries, said, "I
can't get to sleep because I still hear children under the debris
shouting desperately 'Help me! Help me!'"
</P>
<P>
"Survivors of deadly accidents are apt to be afraid that
another big disaster will strike again and take their lives," said
Ha Kyu-sob, a psychiatrist at Seoul National University Hospital.
</P>
<P>
He added that the persistent stress may make them act
unreasonably and imprudently in their life.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Most Cultivable Land Uncropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Some 84 percent of Zambia's
cultivable land remains uncropped, according to a report edited
by the government and the United Nations agencies in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The immediate resource challenge is to make use of the
cultivable land and labor, said the report available here today.
</P>
<P>
The main resources that can support Zambia's future economic
development are its cultivable land, the abundance of labor and
the associated potential for developing the people's stock of
human capital, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Until now, Zambia has done little to develop its economic
potential due to misguided past policies, added the report.
</P>
<P>
The available natural resource based opportunities for the
development of agriculture were obscured by unfavorable policies
and by the general failure to make necessary investments in rural
infrastructure and services, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Palestine Expects U.S. Envoy Middle East Tour to Succeed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Palestinian Council
Ahmed Queria said today Palestine hoped that the current Middle
East tour paid by U.S. envoy Dennis Ross would succeed.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Egyptian Sawt Al-Arab Radio, Queria
said the tour of Ross was expected to succeed so as to pave the
way for U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's visit to the
region at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Palestinian side would brief Ross on its
standpoint about the current situation of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Queria described the deadlock over the Middle East peace as
"very dangerous", saying the peace process will not achieve its
objectives unless the Israeli government halts the building of
Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem and lifts the punitive
sanctions imposed on the Palestinians following the two suicide
bombing attacks in West Jerusalem on July 30.
</P>
<P>
Ross arrived in Israel on Saturday, whose tour was reported to
aim at providing an appropriate atmosphere for Albright to visit
the Middle East at the end of this month as well as strengthening
security cooperation between Israel and Palestine.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Departs for Direct Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides left here today for Switzerland to attend the second
round of the United Nations-sponsored direct talks between leaders
of the two communities in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press before his departure, Clerides said he
has got support of all Cypriot political parties for the second
round of talks on certain issues.
</P>
<P>
"First, to go to the talks, second, to submit our remarks on
the second U.N. document and third, to go there with good will to
discuss the fundamental aspects of the Cyprus problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
He avoided replying to questions concerning the strategy of the
Greek Cypriot side during the talks.
</P>
<P>
The second round of face-to-face talks between President
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash will begin
Monday at the Hotel Righi Vaudois in Glion-sur-Montreux.
</P>
<P>
According to a U.N. announcement, a photo opportunity for a
pool of media representatives will be organized at the hotel at
the start of the talks and from then on, there will be no other
media access at the site of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
A press briefing will be held at the end of the talks on August
16, by U.N. Secretary-General's Special Advisor on the Cyprus
problem Diego Cordovez at the Palais des Nations. Cordovez will
preside over the five-day talks.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the talks is for the two communities to create
new constitutional and institutional structures which will allow
the people of both Cypriot communities to live together in peace,
the U.N. announcement said earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Clerides and Denktash held their first round of talks, under
the U.N. auspices, at Troutbeck, near New York, from July 9-12.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides is accompanied by Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides, Government Spokesman Manolis Christofides, and his two
advisers, Attorney-General Alecos Markides and Under Secretary to
the president Pantelis Kouros.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus issue has remained unresolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkish troops invaded and took over the
northern third in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with
Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite this island
nation as bi-communal, bi-zonal federation through peace talks,
but so far no tangible results have been achieved.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen today accused the United States of imposing its
so-called democracy and human rights on Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with "the Washington Times" and "the Washington
Post," Hun Sen said that the United States should learn a lesson
from the history, introspecting what it had done to the Cambodian
people.
</P>
<P>
He said the fire of the decades-long Cambodia War had been
ignited by the United States, which had cost tens of thousands of
Cambodians' lives.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is meaningless for Washington to have the
Cambodian people accept its so-called democracy and human rights.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said it is impossible that large-scale war would occur
again in today's Cambodia, which is facing the challenge of
achieving stable politics, economic development and elimination of
poverty.
</P>
<P>
he said that his government would abide by the Paris peace
accord as well as the result of the 1993 election so as to ensure
the free and just general elections scheduled for May 1998.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Continues to Use Jordan's Aqaba Port as Key Supply Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today reassured Jordan of the
continuous using of the latter's Red Sea port of Aqaba as a key
route for receiving humanitarian aid despite of the planned
opening of a supply line through Syria.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Iraqi Minister of Industry and Mineral Resources Adnan
Alani made the promise here at a meeting with Jordanian Prime
Minister Abdul Salam Majali and Minister of Trade, Industry and
Supply Hani Mulki.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time for an Iraqi cabinet minister to
make such assurance. Iraqi Minister of Commerce Mohammed
Mehdi Saleh had made the same assurance on August 3.
</P>
<P>
Alani, who arrived here Saturday, also called on Jordanian
authorities to increase exports to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
This was part of the Iraqi effort to develop bilateral
relations with Jordan and strive for closer cooperation in
economic and trade sectors, he said
</P>
<P>
Mulki said on the occasion that Iraq would double its imports
via Aqaba more than that witnessed in the first phase of the
oil-for-food reached between Iraq and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The deal allows Iraq to export oil worth two billion
U.S. dollars in a 6-month period to buy back food and medicine
badly needed in the country.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the deal started last December and has been
renewed for another six months.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's promise to use Aqaba port came after Baghdad applied to
the U.N. for the opening of the Iraq-Syria border. This route, if
approved by the U.N., will facilitate the flow-in of the
Syrian-made goods which are cheaper than the Jordanian-made
products and provide European exporters a shorter transportation
line to Iraq than the one through Aqaba port.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's applyment has triggered fear among the Jordanian
businessmen of losing business with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Via Aqaba port, Iraq imported civilian goods and military
equipment during the Iraqi-Iranian war in the 1980s and Jordan
made more than one billion dollars every year from entrepot trade
through Aqaba port bound for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, the Aqaba port lost its glory when the U.N. sanctions
was imposed on Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Iraq has
since then relied more on its border with Turkey as well as its
own Um Qasr port, both of which were approved by the U.N. under
the oil-for-food deal for Baghdad to import humanitarian goods.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been Iraq's largest trade partner for years, with
its exports of goods and services to Iraq totaled 220 million
dollars in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Government Open for Dialogue with Political Powers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Salam Majali said here today that his government was, is and will
be open for holding talks with all political forces in the country
on issues of the parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
The one-person, one-vote system, which was one of the main
reasons for some political parties to boycott the elections,
conforms to the idea of equation among the Jordanian citizens and
the country's constitution, Radio Jordan quoted the prime minister
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Majali also called for reviewing the arrangements and measures
in connection with the forthcoming elections, which were earlier
dated as on November 4.
</P>
<P>
The arrangements for the elections must guarantee a fair, free
and democratic atmosphere for voting, he added.
</P>
<P>
Altogether six opposition parties decided to boycott the
elections because they opposed the Press and Publication Law, the
one-person, one-vote election system, the normalization of ties
with Israel and the government's measures to marginalize political
parties.
</P>
<P>
After the declaration of boycott, the government showed its
willingness to hold dialogues with the opposition parties in an
effort to settle the disputes.
</P>
<P>
But all the parties refused to cooperate with the government
and continue to keep their stance of boycott.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties now occupy 23 seats in the 80-member
Lower House of Parliament.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy Aims Mission at Middle East Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Middle East peace envoy
Dennis Ross said here today that his current mission will focus on
restoring Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation following a
bloody suicide attack.
</P>
<P>
Ross told reporters after meeting with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this morning that
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeline
Albright asked him to focus his efforts on security questions.
</P>
<P>
The security relationship between Israel and Palestine
should be established "in a way that is productive and effective,"
said Ross, adding that Albright will visit the region only after
progress is made on security.
</P>
<P>
Ross arrived here Saturday night to try to ease tensions
plunged deeper into crisis by a July 30 suicide bombing at an
Israeli market that killed 15 people, including two Islamic
suicide bombers, and wounded 170 others.
</P>
<P>
The militant Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) claimed
responsibility for the attack, which extinguished a glimpse of
optimism for resuming the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks that
have been stalled since Israel began building the Har Homa
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who left the prime minister's office for a meeting with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in the West Bank, said Clinton
and Albright also recognized there was "a political dimension that
has to be addressed".
</P>
<P>
Ross's comments seemed to please Israel, which has placed its
security needs above progress in peace talks, but will anger the
Palestinians who hoped Ross to address their concerns, especially
the punitive measures taken by Israel following the bombings.
</P>
<P>
Israel closed off the West Bank and Gaza after the market
attack, expelled Palestinians working in Israel and halted the
transfer of tax revenues it collected on Palestinian National
Authority's (PNA) behalf, and conditioned any resumption of talks
on Arafat cracking down on Islamic militant groups.
</P>
<P>
In a television interview with Reuters and CNN on Saturday,
Arafat said he was making a "100 percent effort" to arrest
militants trying to wreck peace moves.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Arafat made it clear that it was
unacceptable for Ross to focus his efforts only on Israel's
security concerns.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also said on Saturday that he would raise with Ross the
issue of Israel's Jewish settlement policy on land occupied since
the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat refused to comment on
Ross's statements, saying the Palestinians were waiting to be
briefed by the envoy himself on the purpose of his trip.

medallist Olimpiada Ivanova of Russia and women's 800 meters

<HEADLINE> Labor Government Attacked As Hospital Queues Lengthen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Waiting lists in National Health
Service (NHS) hospitals are set to rise sharply over the next
year, despite Labor's election promise of swifter patient
treatment.
</P>
<P>
It could drive hospital waiting lists up by as much as 360,000
over the next two years, according to calculations based on the
Government's budget forecasts.
</P>
<P>
Chantrey Vellacott, a firm of accountants, said waiting lists
are set to rise by as many as 500 patients a day until the middle
of 1999 unless spending is increased.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Alan Milburn has admitted that waiting
lists will get longer in 44 of the 100 health authorities in
England and shorter in only four.
</P>
<P>
Among them, almost half the health authorities in England have
discreetly altered their contractual arrangements to allow for
longer waiting times.
</P>
<P>
South Essex, West Herts and West Sussex have told hospitals to
keep within maximum waiting times of 18 months in 1997-98,
compared with a maximum of 12 months last year.
</P>
<P>
The Chantrey Vellacott report warned of other unaccounted
costs, including three billion pounds (4.8 billion U.S. dollars) of
negligence claims and the cost of changing the date in computers
at the millennium.
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Democrats said that before election, hardly a day
went by without Labor highlighting the problem of growing waiting
lists. One of the Government's key manifesto pledges was to take
100,000 people off waiting lists.
</P>
<P>
However, Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat health spokesman,
said: "The harsh reality is that under Labor, waiting lists are
set to get longer."

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Raps Israel for Escalating Mideast Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait today accused
Israel of escalating the Middle East tension and urged the
international community to press the Jewish state to put
the peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
After a weekly session chaired by Kuwaiti acting Prime
Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, Kuwaiti cabinet said in
a statement that Israel's activities in southern Lebanon,
Palestinian autonomous areas and Jerusalem would further
complicate the already tense situation in the region and thwart
current efforts to revive the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the international community,
especially the Unites States and Russia, co-sponsors of the peace
process, should pressure Israel to stop its "arbitrary" measures
against the Palestinians and step up efforts to salvage the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the Jerusalem suicide bombings on July 30, in
which 15 people were killed and 170 others wounded, Israel has
closed the Palestinian self-ruled areas of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip and imposed crippling economic sanctions upon them.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been deadlocked since
Israel began the construction of a Jewish settlement in East
Jerusalem in March this year.

<HEADLINE> Software Error in Guam Airport Radar System Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- A software error was found in
a Guam airport radar system that might have prevented last week's
deadly crash of a Korean Air jet in Guam, U.S. federal
investigators said today.
</P>
<P>
The FAA Radar Minimum Safe Altitude Warning normally issues an
alert if a jet is flying too low, and officials on the ground
inform the pilot. But U.S. federal investigators said the system
was modified recently and an error apparently was inserted into
the software, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
National Transportation Safety Board investigators said the
software error is not the culprit in Wednesday's crash of Korean
Air Flight 801, which crashed and skidded along a hillside
overlooking Guam International Airport, killing 225 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a cause, it might have possibly been a
prevention," said George Black, an NTSB member.
</P>
<P>
However, the finding is a major piece in the crash. But the
warning system was not the only piece of equipment not operating
on Guam at the time of the crash. The airport's glide slope, which
helps guide the pilot to the runway, was not in service at the
time the plane crashed.
</P>
<P>
The altitude warning system is designed to cover a circular
area with a radius of 63 miles. However, after the software was
modified, it only covered about a mile-wide circular strip that
ran the circumference of the area. Flight 801 was not covered when
it crashed, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Investigators were looking into when the software was altered
and whether only the Guam system was affected.
</P>
<P>
They also were looking at other crucial aspects of the crash,
such as the heavy rain that might be an impact to the crash.
Meanwhile, the NTSB has dispatched officials to Seoul to look at
Korean Air's training methods and the crew records.

ATHENS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Daniel Komen of Kenya won the men's
5,000 meters gold medal at the 6th World Athletics Championships here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
His winning time was 13 minutes 07.38 seconds, ahead of Khalid
Boulami of Morocco's 13:09.34 and Tom Nyariki of Kenya's 13:11.09.
</P>
<P>
Komen, who had beaten the 13-minute-barrier three times this season
before the meet with a personal best of 12:48.98, control the race
completely from the gun to the finish. His leading position was never
challenged before winning his first world title with time to spare.
</P>
<P>
Boulami, 1992 Olympic champion, denied a Kenya 1-2 finish when he
outkicked Nyariki on the home straight.
</P>
<P>
"I knew I need a fast race and a good time to win the gold medal.
Now I have two days of rest before I face Gebreselassie in the 5,000m
race in Zurich. I am still working on a plan to be able to beat him,"
said Komen.
</P>
<P>
Boulami said:"I expected Komen to go away like this for the last
1,000 meters. He surprised me by doing it so early. I didn't notice
his move at the right moment."

ATHENS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Sergey Bubka of Ukraine won the men's
pole vault world title six times in a row when he sailed over 6.01
meters at the 6th World Athletics Championships here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
With the victory, he becomes the first person in the world to win
all the titles in the championship history. But the 33-year-old
disappointed the crowd when he gave up his three attacks at the 6.15
meters, one centimeter more than his own world record.
</P>
<P>
The silver medal was won by Maksim Tarasov of Russia at 5.96m and
the bronze went to Dean Starkey of the United States at 5.91m.
</P>
<P>
Bubka, who has broken the world record for 35 times, entered the
meet with a 5.60 meter best this season, but performed brilliantly in
today's final.
</P>
<P>
Tarasov, the 1992 Olympic champion who jumped over 6.00 meters
early this year, was his only challenger. The Russian jumped over
5.96m on his first attempt, but Bubka sailed over 6.01m on his opening
try. With the gold in hand, Bubka intended to beat the record, but
stopped midway on his first attack at 6.15m.

"If the first start had been okay, I think the winning time would

Africa rose by 5.2 percent in June to 39,140 kg from 37,168 kg in
the previous month, the Chamber of Mines announced at the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
On a year-by-year basis, chamber production in June rose 204
kg or 0.5 percent from the 3,893 kg produced in the same month in
1996, the chamber said.
</P>
<P>
Production so far this year has reached 241,581 kg, or 2.3
percent down compared with the 247,096 kg produced in the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Non-chamber producers' output measured 736 kg this June
compared with the 753 kg registered in May, the chamber said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is the biggest gold producer and exporter in the
world. However, its gold output has been declining in recent
years. For this, the chamber sealed a contract with gold miners
last month in which it promised to raise the miners' pay in
return for their pledge to increase 90 tons of gold this year.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot Leader Pessimistic about Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas
today expressed his pessimism about the upcoming second round of
U.N.-sponsored peace talks with the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Denktas said that the peace talks with the Cypriot government
is bound to fail if Turkish Cypriots' equality and sovereignty is
neglected, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot leader made the remarks during a stopover in
Istanbul's Ataturk Airport en route to a meeting with Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides in the Swiss town of Montreux tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Turkish Cypriots are determined to defend their
basic rights, Denktas said that the Greek Cypriot side should make
positive steps for the setting up of a bi-zonal federation on the
divided island.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated his early demand that the Cypriot government
should freeze its accession negotiations with the European Union (EU)
and stop the development of anti-aircraft missile system to be
purchased from Russia.
</P>
<P>
"I think this meeting will be the last one. If no clarity is
reached on these topics, it will be clear that we can go nowhere,"
Denktas said.
</P>
<P>
On the first round of talks with Clerides under the U.N. mediation
near New York from July 9 to 12, Denktas said that there had been a
political setback, or regression, since the talks in New York.
</P>
<P>
Rebuffing the accusations of the Turkey-Northern Cyprus partial
integration accord signed last week, the Turkish Cypriot leader
said that these people should ask how the Cypriot government could
apply to the EU on behalf of the whole island.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot President Clerides left earlier today for Switzerland to
attend the peace talks with Denktas, according to reports reaching
here.
</P>
<P>
A Turkish delegation from the Foreign Ministry led by Deputy
Undersecretary Inal Batu will reportedly also fly to the Swiss town of
Montreux to monitor the talks between the two rival communities of
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and took over the northern third of the island in the wake of an
abortive coup by Greek Cypriots who tried to seek union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
For years, the United Nations has been striving for a peaceful
settlement of the thorny issue but no concrete results have been
achieved so far.

<HEADLINE> Half Million S. Africans Apply to Join Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 10 (Xinhua) -- More than half a million
people have applied to the South African Police Services (SAPS)
for only one thousand jobs recently advertized by the police, an
official said today.
</P>
<P>
SAPS Human Resources Manager Strini Govender, who is in charge
of the process of recruitment, said the SAPS has received
6189,327 applications to fill the 1,200 jobs recently advertized.
</P>
<P>
The police management is interpreting the situation as a sign
of public confidence in the police force. They have brushed aside
suggestion that this could be a desperate sign of unemployed
people willing to take on any job.
</P>
<P>
Graduates from universities and technical colleges, who are
unable to find employment, are also reportedly trying their luck
with the SAPS.
</P>
<P>
According to Govender, 93.3 percent of the applicants are from
the black population. Colored applicants accounted for 3.3
percent. Indian and white applicants accounted for 1.5 and 1.7
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Govender said the lengthy process of sifting through the
applications to find the right candidates could mean that
successful candidates might start their duties a year from now.
</P>
<P>
"We are currently involved in checking whether applicants
fulfill the basic requirements, which include a matriculation
certificate and a driver's license," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that "those without a driver's license will not
qualify for the second phase of the process, which include an
interview, a literacy test, as well as a medical fitness test."
</P>
<P>
At least 40 police personnel have been assigned the task of
sifting through piles of applications.

Sarajevo, August 10 (Xinhua) -- British princess Diana on
Sunday ended a three-day visit to Bosnia as part of her world-wide
campaign to spotlight human sufferings from landmines.
</P>
<P>
The visit of the divorced princess was sponsored by the
Washington-based landmine survivors' network and took her to
Tuzla, Zenica and Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, she had met with victims of landmines, some
of them children, rehabilitation facilities and former frontlines.
</P>
<P>
In more than three years of the Bosnian war which ended in
1995, an estimated three millions of mines had been laid across
the country by fighting ethnic foes and a fraction of them have
since been dismantled.

<HEADLINE> Former S. Leone Leader Asked to Help Resume Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Former Sierra Leonean leader
Joseph Momoh has been brought back on the political stage for a
peaceful solution to the current crisis as neighboring countries
tightened sanctions against the military junta.
</P>
<P>
Former president Momoh, who himself was overthrown in a coup
five years ago, was called back from exile by ousted president
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah to help restart the failed Abidjan peace
talks, the British Broadcasting Corporation reported today.
</P>
<P>
Momoh was quoted as saying today he hastened to lead a
delegation to neighboring Guinea for talks with President Lansana
Conte.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which was held on Saturday night, helped return all
hopes for peaceful settlement of the Sierra Leone crisis, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We are all unhappy with the present situation in the country.
I thought I could use what little remaining influence I have with
the Guinean authorities and with the foreign ministers of the
sub-region to help resolve the present impasse in Sierra Leone in
a peaceful manner," Momoh said.
</P>
<P>
The former president did not mention the outcome of the talks
he had on Saturday night with Guinean authorities, saying he had
to discuss the negotiations with Freetown's military junta leader
Major Johnny Paul Koroma before making anything public.
</P>
<P>
It is not known what effect this move would have on the United
Nations demand for the restoration of power to ousted president
Kabbah's government.
</P>
<P>
But many observers are keen to see what will evolve in the
next few weeks in Sierra Leone's political maze.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Sierra Leone has been tense after the
blockade of the troubled country's land, sea and airspace by the
west African peace-keeping force was tightened in the wake of
Koroma's announcement that the junta will stay in power for four
years.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Imposes New Arms Embargo on Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The South African government has
ordered a ban on the sale of 12 Rooivalk helicopters to Turkey due
to Ankara's Cyprus policy and human rights record.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper Daily News said today that the decision was
made for fear that the South Africa-manufactured choppers might be
used in Cyprus or Turkey's military operation in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that South Africa's Sunday Independent Daily
quoted Kader Asmal, chairman of the board which imposed the new
arms embargo on Ankara, as saying that this move could be seen as
a protest against Turkey's Cyprus policy and its poor human rights
situation.
</P>
<P>
Denel, the Rooivalk-type helicopter producer, however, has
reportedly planned to do more arms business with Turkey, which is
making efforts to enhance its defense capacity.
</P>
<P>
The South African government lifted a previous arms blockade in
April, which was imposed following a massive Turkish military
incursion in northern Iraq to strike outlawed Kuridsh Workers'
Party rebels there in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Xinhua HK Branch Holds Reception on Chief's Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 11 (Xinhua) -- More than 2,000 people from
all walks of life in Hong Kong attended a reception given by the
Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch this evening to bid farewell
to its former director Zhou Nan and welcome its new director Jiang
 Enzhu.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Nan, who came to work in Hong Kong as Xinhua Hong Kong
Branch chief in February 1990, said at the reception that it was
"the greatest delight" in his life to take part in and witness the
 return of Hong Kong to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The "one country, two systems" concept has now become a reality
 in Hong Kong, he said, adding that future developments will prove
 the great vitality of this concept.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that during the past seven years or so he got to know
 Hong Kong people's love of their motherland, and their
industriousness, wisdom and enterprising spirit had left an
indelible impression on him.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had made friends with many people in different
walks of life in Hong Kong and established profound friendship
with them. This friendship, he said, will live for ever.
</P>
<P>
He also wished the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) government headed by Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa new
successes in their work to maintain sustained prosperity and
stability in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Enzhu, former Chinese ambassador to Britain who came here
 on August 6 to replace Zhou, spoke highly of Zhou Nan's fruitful
work in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said that with Hong Kong's return, the functions of Xinhua
News Agency Hong Kong Branch "will be adjusted appropriately". It
"will not interfere in the affairs which fall in the domain of the
 high-degree autonomy of the Hong Kong SAR" and it "will continue
to maintain extensive contacts with people in different walks of
life in Hong Kong and make its own contributions in enhancing the
contacts and exchanges between Hong Kong and the inland areas," he
 stated.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed the conviction that Hong Kong people will
surely build a better future under the leadership of the SAR
government and with the backing of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa expressed heartfelt thanks to
Zhou Nan and extended a warm welcome to Jiang Enzhu on behalf of
the SAR government and Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that Hong Kong got to an inspiring start in
implementing the principles of "one country, two systems," "Hong
Kong people governing Hong Kong" with a high degree of autonomy. A
 host of facts after the establishment of the SAR on July 1 have
shown the Central Government's determination to carry out these
principles, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Among those present at the reception were vice chairmen of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference Ann Tse-kai and Henry Fok Ying-tung and representatives
 of the SAR government, the Executive Council, the Provisional
Legislative Council, the People's Liberation Army Hong Kong
Garrison and the Commissioner's Office of the Chinese Foreign
Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh, India Reach Consensus on Tie-up Dam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Water experts of Bangladesh and
neighboring India today reached consensus on the construction of a
tie-up embankment on both sides of the common river Teesta,
informed sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The consensus was reached at the Standing Committee of the
Bangladesh-India Joint River Commission (JRC), which today began a
cross-border meeting on Lalmonirhat town, 270 kilometers northwest
of Bangladesh's capital Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
The sharing of waters of the Teesta is also being discussed at
the Standing Committee meeting, said the sources, adding that the
two countries share 54 common rivers while both sides last
December signed a 30-year water treaty on sharing Ganges water.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Sunday, the water experts on the JRC inspected the
changed course of the Teesta in Bangladesh's side, to find out the
technical feasibility of an embankment on the right bank of the
common river.
</P>
<P>
The proposed one and half a kilometer embankment will start
from Permekligonj in India and end at the no-man's land near
Kaligonj in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The JRC Standing Committee members are expected to begin
another round of talks at Shiliguri in India on August 12. The JRC
members will visit the Indian Teesta Barrage Project at Bazal Doba
before beginning the two-day meeting, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The Shiliguri meeting is scheduled to finalize the draft
proposal on the construction of the tie-up embankment, the sources
added.

<HEADLINE> France Supports OAU Intervention in Comoran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- France today expressed its support
for the intervention by the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
aimed at finding a "negotiated solution" to the crisis in the
Indian Ocean nation of Comoros.
</P>
<P>
A group of separatists in one of the Comoran islands, Anjouan,
last week declared "independence" and asked for the return of
French rule.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that this intervention (by the OAU) should
create the conditions of a negotiated and lasting solution," said
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutraux.
</P>
<P>
An OAU special envoy, Pierre Yere, held talks with Comoran
President, Mohamed Taki Abdoulakarim, last Saturday and will be in
Anjouan today to talk with the separatists.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said that France opposed the use of force by
either side in the Comoros, and respected the territorial
integrity of the island nation.
</P>
<P>
He also said that France had asked the European Union to
increase economic aid to the Comoros to improve the living
condition of the Comoran people.
</P>
<P>
France granted independence to the Comoros in 1975, but has
retained rule in one of its four islands, Mayotte.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Get 16 Billion U.S. Dollars Bail-out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Thailand got a promise today of at
least 16 billion U.S. dollars in financial aid to rebuild its
flagging economy.
</P>
<P>
The bail-out will come from international financial
institutions and its Asia-Pacific neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The amount was decided at a one-day international conference
here under the initiative of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF). It was held in a bid to help Thailand recover from its
recent currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
In the package, the IMF pledged to provide four billion dollars
under a "standby loans" scheme. Japan offered to extend the same
amount in loans through its Export-Import Bank.
</P>
<P>
A total of five billion dollars has been promised by six
economies, with Australia, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore each
pledging one billion dollars, and Indonesia and South Korea 500
million dollars each.
</P>
<P>
The remaining three billion dollars will come from the World
Bank, the Asian Development Bank and China.
</P>
<P>
The funds were medium-term loans maturing in three to five
years at market-based interest rates, Shigemitsu Sugisaki, IMF
deputy managing director who chaired the Tokyo conference, told a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
The multilateral and bilateral loans will be provided soon,
with the IMF Executive Board approving its loans sometime next
week, Sugisaki said.
</P>
<P>
The size of the bail-out is the second largest of its kind,
after Mexico, which received 50 billion dollars in international
financial assistance during the peso crisis in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's baht currency has been tumbling since the government
shifted to a floating exchange mechanism on July 2. The Thai
currency crisis also had an adverse impact on other Asian currency
markets.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo conference was attended by 10 countries and economies
from the Asia-Pacific region, including China, Japan, Australia,
Singapore and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Reiterates Full Support to Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdul Meguid said today that the Arab organization fully
supports Syria, and that it categorically rejects Israeli threats
to Syria.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the media today, he strongly attacked the
Israeli government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for
intimating that a war would be waged between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Meguid said the Israeli government has gone beyond all
limits by imposing unfair siege on the Palestinian people, and by
repeatedly violating Lebanese sovereignty. In so doing, he said,
Israel is indicating its unwillingness to resume the Middle East
peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Meguid pointed out that any effort or initiative ought to
tackle the root causes of the tension in the region, including
Israel's settlement expansion, tampering with religious beliefs,
and imposition of unjust siege on the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
He called on the U.S. administration to undertake a neutral and
fair role in the peace process, demanding attention be
concentrated on the core of the problem rather than its fringes.
</P>
<P>
Three Katyousha rockets fired from south Lebanon landed in
northern Israel last Friday, wounding three people. Israel has
held Syria responsible for the rocket attack, saying whoever
launched the rockets, the terrorists were working for Syria.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Holds Talks With US Presidential Assistant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Liu Huaqiu, director of the
State Council's Foreign Affairs Office, had a lengthy meeting with
Samuel R. Berger, assistant to the U.S. President for National
Security Affairs, in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that developing a stable and healthy
Sino-U.S. relationship is in the fundamental interests of both
countries and the world at large, and the two sides will continue
to make active efforts toward this end.
</P>
<P>
The talks on Sino-U.S. relations and some major international
issues started this morning and lasted until late in the
afternoon, with both sides expressing their views on President
Jiang Zemin's state visit to the U.S. this fall.
</P>
<P>
Both sides emphasized the significance of the visit, saying
that the two countries should work together to prepare for this
visit and to ensure its success, so that the Sino-US relationship
will enter into a new period of development on the eve of the new
century.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that the 21st century has great
hope. Although the world still faces many challenges, detente and
co-operation are becoming the main stream of international
relations.
</P>
<P>
In the new international situation, they said, the two
countries, which share many important interests, hope to maintain
world peace and stability and avoid the chaos of wars, and are
ready to increase strategic dialogues and co-operation. They
expressed the hope for peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific
region and economic co-operation and development. Preventing the
spread of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction is
a common goal of the two countries, they pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The two countries' economies have become more complementary and
bilateral exchanges in education, science and technology continue
to grow.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have maintained effective co-operation in
fighting international crimes, drug trafficking, illegal
immigration and international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
As two environmental and energy powers, China and the US should
tighten co-operation on environmental protection, which is of
great significance to both sides and to the rest of the world,
they emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Liu Huaqiu said that both sides should have a positive and
realistic attitude toward differences between the two
countries. As long as both sides strictly abide by the principles
of the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and consider the overall
circumstances of the bilateral relationship, conduct dialogue on
equal footing, avoid differences, reinforce co-operation oriented
towards the future, there are many prospects for bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Berger said the U.S. side is willing to collaborate with the
Chinese in making new progress in the bilateral relationship.
</P>
<P>
Berger is here as a guest of the Chinese Foreign Ministry for a
three-day visit. He is expected to meet top Chinese leaders
tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' Economy Shows Signs of Recovery: Finance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' economy is showing
signs of a "relative recovery" this year after its recession in
1996, Finance Minister Christodoulos Christodoulou said here
today.
</P>
<P>
"If unforeseen political developments do not intervene, it
will have better results in 1997 than in 1996," the minister
told reporters after a meeting with the governor of the Central
Bank of Cyprus, the general manager of the Cyprus Development
Bank and some government officials.
</P>
<P>
He said that the 1997 growth rate is expected to be at around
3 percent, compared with 2 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment rate in 1997 will be around 3.3 to 3.4 percent,
while inflation is expected to be around 3.5 percent,
Christodoulou said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the island's public debt, he noted that it is
expected to be around 54 percent of GDP, while the limit set by
the Maastricht Treaty is 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the island's tourism is also recovering,
the minister indicated that there would be a better performance
in the next three to four months than that in the same period of
1996.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, around 1,950,000 tourists visited the island, down
from 2.1 million in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on speculation in the local press concerning the
liberalization of the island's financial system, Christodoulou
said that it would proceed as scheduled, adding that it would
take place before Cyprus' accession negotiations with the
European Union start.
</P>
<P>
"The liberalization would be concluded by March 1998," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for full EU membership in 1990. The EU has
reaffirmed that accession negotiations with Cyprus will begin
early next year.

<HEADLINE> Businessmen Confess to Payments to President's Son </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Two businessmen today admitted
having paid Kim Hyun-chul, the second son of South Korean
President Kim Young-sam, money for favors.
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old junior Kim was arrested on May 17 on charge of
tax evasion, and for having taken at least 3.6 million
U.S. dollars in return for favors from two business firms.
</P>
<P>
However, Kim Hyun-chul rejected the accusations, arguing that
the money was given under the name of "operational funds" or
"political donations."
</P>
<P>
In a hearing on suspected irregularities involving Kim
Hyun-chul Monday in the Seoul Court, Kim Tok-yong, chairman of the
Dooyang Group, indirectly testified that he had given the junior
Kim money, and asked for his influence in a civil suit.
</P>
<P>
The other businessman, Lee Song-ho, former president of Daeho
Construction Company, said he had asked Kim Hyun-chul to influence
an application for a cable television business license.
</P>
<P>
Lee confessed that he had given Kim Hyun-chul a total of two
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Local observers said the confessions of the two businessmen
would help the prosecution verify the charges of irregularities by
Kim.

<HEADLINE> Top Yamaichi Executives Step Down Over Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- As many as 11 top executives of
Japan's fourth largest brokerage, Yamaichi Securities, resigned
from their posts today to take responsibility for the unfolding
scandal involving payoffs to a Sokaiya corporate racketeer.
</P>
<P>
The resigned include Yamaichi Securities Company Chairman
Tsuguo Yukihira, President Atsuo Miki, five vice presidents and
four directors.
</P>
<P>
The resignations came 12 days after Yamaichi was raided by
Tokyo prosecutors searching for evidence to substantiate
suspicions that 79 million yen (680,000 U.S. dollars) was funneled
to racketeer Ryuichi Koike in 1995 as compensation for his
investment losses.
</P>
<P>
Yamaichi's reshuffle follows similar moves by Nomura Securities
Company -- Japan's largest brokerage -- and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank,
one of the country's largest commercial banks, which have also
been involved in payoff scandals involving Koike.
</P>
<P>
Nomura and Dai-Ichi Kangyo have already been forced to suspend
some of their business operations as administrative punishment for
their illegal actions.

<HEADLINE> Militia Demobilization Program Well Underway in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The first militia
demobilization program which started late last month in the Lower
Shabelle region of southern Somalia is running smoothly and
successfully.
</P>
<P>
The program, the first of its kind, has demobilized more than
150 militiamen in a rehabilitation center inside the port town of
Merca, 100 km south of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
All weapons belonging to the militiamen were collected before
enrolling them in the camp where they are given different
lectures including English and basic arithmetic in the first six
months while those who survive their civil education program will
be rewarded with vocational training techniques including proper
farming.
</P>
<P>
According to Zakaria Mohamed Sheikh, one of the 11 teachers at
the Merca Militia Rehabilitation Center, the project is sponsored
by the Italian aid agency COSV and the women group of IIDA with
the collaboration of Hussein Mohamed Aidid's regional security
officials.
</P>
<P>
The project, funded by the European Union office for Somalia,
will last for a year, Zakaria said.
</P>
<P>
The center, headed by Professor Ibrahim Hirsi Aden, former
geology rector of Somalia's National University, provides full
accommodation, food, medicine, launderette for the clothes of the
militiamen and little pocket money exceeding 350,000 Somali
shillings equivalent to 41 U.S. Dollars for each student per
month.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the ordinary lessons, the militiamen are also
taught different lessons on sports and arts.
</P>
<P>
The demobilized militiamen are not allowed to chew khat or
smoke cigarettes during the six-day programs of each week. They
are given a brief holiday of 24 hours every Friday to visit their
families.
</P>
<P>
The demobilization is not only beneficial for the ordinary
citizens whose security is improved with increasing number of
demobilized militiamen, but for the families of the gunmen who
are now receiving this little non-blood stained money.
</P>
<P>
According to the administration of the center, there are quite
a large number of militiamen from the capital and the surrounding
districts applying for the center.
</P>
<P>
"Our resources are limited at the time being, but we're
hopeful that the program will be extended later," Zakaria noted.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Drug Addiction Means Jail Term in UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Two months ago, 43-year-old
Abdullah had never believed his hashish addiction could bring him
to prison, but he was wrong.
</P>
<P>
Spending most of his time in a 1.5-meter-wide, two-meter-long
room in a Sharjah prison in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the
Pakistani engineer is serving his first jail sentence in his
life. He received a one-year jail term two months ago because of
drug use.
</P>
<P>
"I used hashish during a brief holiday but had no idea I
could be imprisoned in the UAE," he told reporters dispiritedly.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested after being found his blood was positive
after addicting hashish. Doctors said hashish and valium could
remain detectable for up to two weeks while hard narcotics such
as heroin and cocaine could linger for up to two months in man's
circulatory system.
</P>
<P>
Under a new UAE anti-drug law issued last year, those who
take, in any way, drugs or psychotropical substances in the UAE
shall be penalized by sentences of one to four years depending
on the drug involved.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah was not the only one who was put into jail because of
drug use. Many others are serving prison terms for the same
offense in UAE prisons.
</P>
<P>
A young Australian woman who was sentenced to four years in
prison when traces of marijuana were detected in her urine. The
25-year-old woman who admitted smoking the drug in Sri Lanka is
awaiting for an appeal against her conviction in a Sharjah
court.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. diplomat here confirmed that four U.S. citizens living
in the UAE are serving sentences in the Dubai jail after
consuming drugs overseas and having been tested positive upon
their return.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers in the UAE said drug use was treated very seriously
in the Gulf country, but they suggested the anti-drug law could
enforce rehabilitation instead of jail.
</P>
<P>
"The laws on drugs here are one of the best of their kind in
the world," said Salim, a lawyer in Abu Dhabi, "the law shows
little sympathy toward drug dealers. For the sake of the
protection of society, the death penalty will be applied to those
promoting and dealing in drugs."
</P>
<P>
"But the authorities could send the abusers for treatment
instead of jail on the basis of some people being patients
rather than criminals," he suggested.
</P>
<P>
Police officers did not agree with the opinion. They are
launching a nation-wide war against drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
"How could drug dealers find a market? A place with many drug
addictors is the most suitable one," said captain Safi Bitar
from Abu Dhabi Police Station.
</P>
<P>
"The best way to eliminate the drug market is to lessen the
number of drug users. Hash punishments are always effective," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He may be right. Many drug users who are serving jail terms
in prison have said they would never thought about hashish or
heroin again.
</P>
<P>
"While I have found out the hardest way possible, I just want
other people to know this can happen and to be careful because I
has ruined my life," Abdullah said regretfully.

BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Minister of Foreign Trade and

of Commerce Tun Kyi, said she hopes that China and Myanmar will
increase border trade to expand bilateral economic and trade
co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the two countries' friendship dates back to
ancient times, that their people enjoy a time-honored friendship,
and that the Chinese government places great importance on
economic and trade co-operation with Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Southwest China's Yunnan province is a neighbor of Myanmar, so
the two sides should make full use of their respective advantages
in economic exchanges to increase mutually-beneficial

efforts in this.
</P>

Bilateral trade volume is currently about 700 millions US
dollars a year. Wu Yi said that the two countries can explore new
ways to co-operate, and expressed confidence in the prospect for
bilateral economic and trade co-operation.

<P>
Tun Kyi said that the purpose of his China trip is to enhance

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Minister Assures Good Price for Crops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian government will
formulate reasonable policies to enable farmers to sell their
crops at good prices, the Minister for the Agro-Industrial Complex
(AIC), Yuri Karasyk, said today.
</P>
<P>
Karasyk made the remarks because of farmers' worry about
possible lower selling prices than production costs for their
crops.
</P>
<P>
However, the AIC minister admitted that the current advance
price for third grade wheat stood at only 270 hryvnas (about 148
U.S. dollars) per ton, while fifth grade was priced at 214 hryvnas
(about 118 dollars) per ton. These prices could hardly cover the
production costs.
</P>
<P>
The final prices for grain should be high enough to cover the
production costs and allow farmers to earn reasonable profits,
Karasyk noted.
</P>
<P>
State policies on prices would be worked out after the grain
harvest, he added.
</P>
<P>
By August 10, more than 60 percent of cereals and beans had
been reaped. Karasyk was fairly optimistic that reaping of crops
would be completed by mid-August.
</P>
<P>
At present, prices for agricultural products in Ukraine are
largely dependent on the level of mechanization of agriculture,
said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He called for leasing of agricultural machines to farmers as a
possible way out of the crisis of shortage of machines.

<HEADLINE> Gold Price Future Still Gloomy: Analysts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Australian gold analysts are
still less than optimistic about the future of gold despite a
moderate price improvement since early this month.
</P>
<P>
The spot gold price slid to 315.60 U.S. dollars an ounce in
early July after news that the Reserve Bank of Australia sold off
two thirds of its gold stocks.
</P>
<P>
After several price fluctuations, it was trading at 327.05
dollars this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Norm Miskelly from Paul Morgan Securities was quoted by the
Australian Associated Press as saying that he expected the gold
price to continue to move sideways for quite some time into the
future, as there was a worldwide oversupply of gold together with
only moderate demand.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not expect the spot price to drop below 300
dollars, nor to move above 340 dollars within the next few months.
</P>
<P>
He believed gold was now less a financial instrument and viewed
instead as a commodity, and as a result has shared the drop in
prices other commodities had experienced.
</P>
<P>
Nic Dinham, a Porter Western gold analyst, said gold would
remain vulnerable to continued central bank sales.
</P>
<P>
A lot of European Union participants were selling their gold
stocks off, but there were still some big countries showing
interest in gold, he said.
</P>
<P>
Analyst Ted Leschke from BZW Australia Ltd said the gold price
is continuing to suffer under hedge funds deliberately forcing
down the price.
</P>
<P>
Other analysts based in Sydney said gold was no longer regarded
as a monetary tool and its future looks poor.

<HEADLINE> More Foreign Investment In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The amount of foreign capital
China used in the first seven months of 1997 reached 26 billion
dollars, up 15.75 percent from the same period last year, in spite
of a decrease in the number of enterprises approved to use foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC), in the first seven months of this year,
11,487 enterprises were approved to deal directly with foreign
funds. This involved 26.124 billion US dollars of contractural
investment, down 46.16 percent compared with the same period of
1996.
</P>
<P>
However, actual use of foreign funds by these enterprises
climbed 8.9 percent compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC sources said the solely foreign-owned enterprises and
Sino-foreign joint ventures used a considerably larger amount of
foreign capitals, with increases of 26.65 and 15.02 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months of this year, China also took in 1.7
billion US dollars of foreign investment from other foreign
capital sources, 9.59 times more than for the same period of last
year. These include international leasing, compensation trade and
processing and assembling with imported parts.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine to Have New Income Tax Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian State Taxation
Administration (STA) has drafted a new income tax bill for
taxpayers, following complaints by taxation experts that the
existing law is outdated and does not conform to realities in
Ukraine, STA Superintendent Victor Moroz said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Moroz said the new bill is much simpler and easier to read
because of its more orderly and logical presentation of provisions.
</P>
<P>
The present law on personal income tax has a troublesome
over-abundance of sundry references, making it very hard to
comprehend by legal people, let alone ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
The new version is designed to make provisions clear-cut,
unambiguous and understandable to ordinary taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
Under the new bill, monthly income above 70.6 hryvnas (about
38.8 dollars), which is the poverty line drawn by the Ukrainian
parliament, shall be taxable. Under the old law, citizens earning
above 18 hryvnas a month (about 10 dollars) should pay a tax.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the active law, the new bill will have a
simplified scale with three major categories of 10, 20 and 30
percent introduced instead of the existing 10, 15, 20, 30 and 40
percent of the aggregate income.
</P>
<P>
Moroz said he believed that the new law would appear very
attractive to low-income citizens.

<HEADLINE> France: Congo Republic Fighting "Unacceptable" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- France today described the renewed
fighting in Brazzaville, capital of the Congo Republic, as
"unacceptable," and deplored the breakdown of the ceasefire signed
by the two warring factions on July 13.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux said: "It is
again for Congolese parties to put an end to the hostilities and
agree rapidly on a political accord under the auspices of Gabonese
President Omar Bongo and Mohamed Sahnoun, the representative of
the OAU (Organization of African Unity) and the United Nations for
the Great Lakes region."
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.N. Security Council would not send a
peacekeeping force to Brazzaville until a political agreement was
reached between the two warring sides, and a ceasefire observed.
</P>
<P>
The troops loyal to Congolese President Pascal Lissouba and
militias controlled by former President Denis Sassou Nguesso have
used artillery and other heavy weapons in a new round of fighting
which began on August 7. Reports said there had been heavy
casualties to civilians in Brazzaville.
</P>
<P>
More than 4,000 people have been killed since fighting began in
Brazzaville on June 5 between the two rival factions, while
negotiations mediated by Bongo and Sahnoun in Libreville have
failed to produce concrete results.
</P>
<P>
The French Ambassador to Brazzaville, Raymond Cesaire, who is
one of the few foreign envoys holding out there, said on Sunday
that he did not plan to quit the city. He urged the parties to
seek a political solution to the conflict with "diplomatic
tenacity."

<HEADLINE> Worst Fighting Breaks out in Somalia Since May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Three people were killed and
three others wounded when armed militiamen exchanged heavy fire
at the ex-control junction via Afgoe of south Mogadishu Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to an eyewitness, the fighting started when a convoy
of vehicles transporting khat from the K-50 airstrip and escorted
by battle wagons were attacked by other militiamen trying to loot
the khat.
</P>
<P>
Reports said all three victims killed in the attack were
combatant militiamen, while the wounded were civilians caught in
the cross fire. The fighting subsided as each side of the
militiamen ran for defense.
</P>
<P>
Attacks on the khat kiosks by gunmen are frequent, but this
one was the most serious since south Mogadishu returned to
relative calmness following the agreement between the factions
led by Osman Ali Atto and Hussein Aidid in May this year.

<HEADLINE> Lucent's Millionth Switching Gear Line In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Lucent Technologies, the leading
US telecommunications company, announced today in Beijing that it
has installed the one millionth line of one of the world's most
technically sophisticated switches in China.
</P>
<P>
Randy Yeh, president of Lucent Technologies (China) Co., Ltd.,
said that it was installed in a telephone switching center in
Qingdao, a coastal city in Shandong Province, on July 24, and will
support more than 35,000 phone lines.
</P>
<P>
The 5ESS-2000 was developed by Bell Laboratories, the R and D
arm of Lucent Technologies, at the start of the 1990s, and is used
in more than 50 countries and regions, and is known for its
outstanding transmission capacity and speed.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Defects Seen in Phare Aid Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A global evaluation of the
Phare aid program, the first since its launching in early 1990, has
discovered defects within the program, a European Commission press
release said today.
</P>
<P>
An evaluation submitted to the European Parliament has shown
fragmentation of effort and lack of leverage in implementing Phare
(Program of Aid for Central and Eastern Europe).
</P>
<P>
The program, set up after the Group of Seven summit in
July 1989, provides assistance to central and eastern European
countries for their reform in the sectors of transport, energy and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
"Its effectiveness and impact have been diluted by lack of
leverage to ensure good program performance, by deficiencies in
project cycle management and by a preoccupation with financial and
procedural control to the detriment of substantive program design
and performance," the release said.
</P>
<P>
The evaluation, however, showed that the Phare had also shown
"remarkable flexibility in addressing the different needs of the
partner countries, which have embarked on transition from
different starting points with different paces."
</P>
<P>
The evaluation, drawn up by independent consultants, was based
on monitoring and assessing Phare's relevance, appropriateness,
impact, effectiveness, sustainability and efficiency.

<P>
BANGKOK, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Thailand for the first time will
start to export chickens to Canada this year, according to the
Thai Commerce Ministry today.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has granted the
certificates to five Thai companies for exports of chickens to
Canada, the foreign trade department under the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Thai exporters will have to meet high quarantine
standards and pass tight examinations by Canada, which blocked
Thai chicken products' entry into Canada in the past, the
department said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand exported 12 billion baht (480 million U.S. dollars)
worth of frozen chickens and chicken products last year. The Thai
Commerce Ministry has set a target of 13 billion baht for this
year.

<HEADLINE> Annan's U.N. Reform Gets Support From 16 Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan accepted a formal statement of support from 16
countries on reform within the U.N., in Stockholm, Sweden.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued today by the U.N. Office at Geneva
(UNOG) said the statement was presented on Sunday by Swedish Prime
Minister Goran Persson.
</P>
<P>
Persson's predecessor, Ingvar Carlsson, convinced the 16
countries -- Australia, Brazil, Canada, Cote d'Ivoire, the Czech
Republic, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Jamaica, Japan, the
Republic of Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, South Africa, and
Sweden -- in 1995 to encourage U.N. reform, on the occasion of the
U.N. 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the 16 countries described the U.N. reform package
proposed by Annan in July as "timely," and deserving of "full
support" of their governments.
</P>
<P>
"There is an opportunity to take real and substantive steps
forward. That opportunity should not be missed," they were quoted
by the UNOG release as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Now is the time to go from words to deeds," the statement
said. "Let's empower the United Nations to confront, through
collective action, the global challenges of the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
Annan expressed thanks to Persson for the statement, which he
saw as a sign of growing government support for his proposals.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A three-day '97 Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) Symposium on telecommunications sector
opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by China's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications
(MPT) and APEC Telecommunication Working Group, the symposium,
which is attended by senior telecom officials and delegates from
APEC, is expected to touch on potential co-operation in human
resource development in the telecom sector, an industry in need of
well-trained employees.
</P>
<P>
Also on the agenda are long-distance education, vocational
education for the telecom industry, multimedia technology, and a
human resource database.
</P>
<P>
A number of countries in the Asia-Pacific region have achieved
rapid growth in recent years and the trade volume of 18 members
accounted for 46 percent of the world's total. The telecom
industry, a pioneer in the region's economic growth, needs to be
developed.
</P>
<P>
Lin Jiquan, vice-minister of MPT, said in the opening speech
that the speedy development of China's telecom industry shows
that telecom moderization should rely on scientific advancement
and good employees.
</P>
<P>
China's posts and telecom industry in 1996 employed a total of
1.2 million full and part-time workers, with the per-capita labor
productivity of 119,000 yuan, or 29.6 percent more than in
1995. The target set by MPT is 220,000 yuan in the year 2000, he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Minister of Trade and
Economy, Maher Masri, today underlined the necessity of bringing
the Mideast peace process back on its right course.
</P>
<P>
This came in an interview broadcast by the "Sawt Al-Arab" radio
of Egypt today.
</P>
<P>
Masri hoped that Dennis Ross, the U.S. coordinator of the
Middle East peace process, would succeed in his current mission
understand the Palestinian viewpoint and go back to the general
principles of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Palestinian side believes that all aspects of
the Middle East peace process - including security and and all the
other issues agreed upon in the Oslo peace accord - are linked
together.
</P>
<P>
As for the security issue on which Israel insists, el Masri
pointed out that it is an item of the Oslo accord, and security
cooperation between the two sides has not ceased.
</P>
<P>
There has even been tripartite coordination among Palestinian,
Israeli and American counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Ross met yesterday both Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Following his meeting
with Ross, Arafat agreed to resume Palestinian-Israeli security
coordination, but he made it a condition that the U.S. side
participate in it as a witness.
</P>
<P>
Ross arrived in Israel Saturday night to start a new round of
U.S. mediation designed to revive the Middle East peace process.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Daqing Oilfield, China's
largest, recently added one billion tons of oil reserves, meaning
another 15 years of high oil yields in the old oilfield in
Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
It began production in the 1960s, and after three decades, its
proven reserves are 5.26 billion tons, 4.65 billion tons of which
have already been tapped. It has drilled 30,312 oil and water
wells.
</P>
<P>
In 1976, annual output went above the 50 million ton mark, a
peak, and 56 million tons in 1994, and the output has kept at that
level for three years. Its output in 1996 accounted for 35.6
percent of China's total.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, Daqing's aggregate crude oil output was
1.46 billion tons, 47 percent of China's total continental oil
output. In the first six months of this year, 27.79 million tons
of crude oil were produced, with an industrial output value of
25.3 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Daqing Oil Management Bureau is China's No.1 industrial
conglomerate. Its long-term development has reduced the number of
blow-out wells and water-injection and polymer flooding have been
used to ensure steady production.
</P>
<P>
Its goal for the next 15 years is to become a multinational oil
syndicate and by 2010 to increase sales and profit to three times
the 1995 amount.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong has decided to
contribute to a financing package organized by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) to assist Thailand in making economic
adjustments.
</P>
<P>
According to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the
package was agreed at a meeting organized by the IMF in Tokyo
today.
</P>
<P>
An HKMA spokesman said that at the request of the IMF,
participants agreed to a financing package totaling 16 billion
U.S. dollars including one billion dollars from Hong Kong, four
billion US dollars from the IMF and the rest from Japan,
Australia, Singapore, South Korea and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Lending to Thailand will take the form of a medium-term loan at
market interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Donald Tsang, financial secretary and controller of the Hong
Kong Exchange Fund, said that Hong Kong is committed to regional
monetary stability.
</P>
<P>
He said that the recent spate of speculative attacks has caused
volatility of various degrees in the currency markets of Southeast
Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Although the Hong Kong dollar has not been affected, the
likely contagion effect is very real," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is in Hong Kong's interests as a leading
financial center in the region to see a strong and stable
neighboring environment.
</P>
<P>
HKMA Chief Executive Joseph Yam who represented Hong Kong's
financial secretary at the Tokyo meeting said that Hong Kong's
participation in the financing package to Thailand will contribute
to the overall financial stability of the region.
</P>
<P>

crossroads in regional financial cooperation, and possibly as a
precursor of standing arrangements.

<HEADLINE> Pigs Heart Transplants for Humans Possible in 5 to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Pig hearts and kidneys could be
transplanted into humans within five to 10 years, a senior
cardiologist said today.
</P>
<P>
Venom from the deadly cobra snake may be the secret ingredient
that allows the breakthrough to happen, said Peter MacDonald, an
associate professor at the University of New South Wales.
</P>
<P>
he said an acute shortage of human donors had forced
researchers to examine using pig hearts in transplant patients.
</P>
<P>
The major hurdle was stopping the human immune system rejecting
the pig heart through a violent reaction where antibodies
immediately started killing pig cells.
</P>
<P>
"There's a very powerful and rapid rejection response that
occurs within minutes of transplanting a pig organ into a human,"
MacDonald said.
</P>
<P>
"The cobra venom factor is a derivative of cobra venom and what
it does is take out one of the key steps that starts this
hyper-rejection response, interrupting the whole process," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
MacDonald said researchers had already conducted experiments
where rats had survived for a month after receiving guinea pig
hearts.
</P>
<P>
"They might sound like fairly close species but the rat has
pre-formed antibodies against the guinea pig in much the same way
that the human does against the larger pig," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pig hearts were the most compatible with humans because of
their size, the professor added.
</P>
<P>
"Given the development in this area, I think it would be
clinically feasible to do this type of transplant within the next
5 to 10 years," he said.
</P>
<P>
Professor MacDonald will present his findings to the Cardiac
Society of Australia and New Zealand annual meeting on Wednesday
in Hobart, Tasmania island off mainland Australia.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Foreign Ministers End Meeting on Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) ended their special
meeting on Cambodia here today with an agreement to remain engaged
in their efforts for restoring stability in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was briefed by an ASEAN Mission on Cambodia,
consisting of the foreign ministers of Indonesia, Thailand and the
Philippines, on their second meeting with Cambodian Prime Minister
Hun Sen on August 2 in Phnom Penh, Philippine Foreign Minister
Domingo Siazon, chairman of the special meeting, told reporters at
a press conference.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement after the meeting, which lasted about four
hours, the foreign ministers said that as a result of the
briefing, and the discussions that followed, they "agreed that
ASEAN will remain engaged in its efforts to help restore political
stability in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers also discussed the latest developments in
Cambodia, including the appointment of Foreign Minister Ung Huot
as First Prime Minister, and assessed these developments in the
context of their implications and impact on the continuing efforts
to restore political stability in Cambodia, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN will continue to carefully monitor further
developments," they said, adding that the question of recognition
of Foreign Minister Ung Huot as First Prime Minister did not arise
at the meeting "because ASEAN member states recognize states not
governments."
</P>
<P>
The ministers also said that the timing of Cambodia's admission
into ASEAN was not on the agenda of the special meeting.
</P>
<P>
As to the form in which ASEAN will pursue its efforts, the
foreign ministers agreed that it need not necessarily be limited
to direct meetings at the Prime Ministers level on the Cambodia
side, and at the various capitals, but could also proceed at the
level of the foreign ministers at various other places, such as
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of organizing an informal meeting, involving
all parties directly concerned, is also not to be excluded, they
said.
</P>
<P>
Explaining their assignment division of work, in order to
follow up the developments in Cambodia, Siazon said Indonesian
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas will be in contact with Ung Huot,
while Thai Foreign Minister Prachuab Chaiyasan will be contacting
Prince Norodom Ranariddh and his group.

<HEADLINE> More Young Scientists In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Sciences
(Cast) announced today that it will increase the number of young
scientists it employs a great deal this year for the country's
21st century scientific development drive.
</P>
<P>
Lu Yongxiang, the academy's new president, said that this will
satisfy the country's need for new scientists in the next
century. It will add 100 young scientists each year and put them
in responsible positions in key projects.
</P>
<P>
The young scientists must be below 40 and should have a
Ph.D. degree with at least two years' post-doctoral research. Lu
said they will receive financial and equipment assistance from the
academy and the research institutes that employ them.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six institutes have promised to spend at least one
million yuan (about 125,000 US dollars) each in the scientists'
research, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
The academy will assess the work of the employed scientists
after three years, Lu noted, saying that those incompetent will be
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
More than a half of the academy's research institutes have
vacancies for young scientists, 46 of which are in Beijing and
Shanghai, Cast sources said.
</P>
<P>
The academy plans to release its detailed employment plan in
overseas Chinese embassies and consulates and on the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Targets 75 Naira to One Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has set
an exchange rate target of 75 Naira to one U.S. dollar by the end
of the year, compared to a rate of 83.2 Naira to one dollar at
present, The Vanguard reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a competent finance ministry source as
saying that the decision is one of the tools of macro-economic
management adopted by the government for resuscitating the
economy.
</P>
<P>
It is also based on the success in the exchange market in the
first half of 1997, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the year, the Nigerian currency Naira
has been revaluating from 85 Naira to one dollar consistently to
83.3 Naira to one dollar at present, at the autonomous foreign
exchange market operated by the central bank.
</P>
<P>
However, the sharp rise for dollars at the market in the last
few weeks has put the government target at risk, even though the
central bank's increasing the rate of treasure bills has helped
in mopping up some of the funds, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to it, the government has also set a target of a
single digit inflation.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that Nigeria's inflation rate declined
from 28 percent in December last year to 17.5 percent in June.
The targets are 15.5 percent for July and 13.8 for August.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Rejects U.N. Census Estimation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has rejected a U.N
estimation that its population reached 120 million, insisting
that the biggest African country's population is 104.2 million.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Champion today quoted Lieutenant-Colonel Charis
Ugokwe, chairman of the National Population Commission as saying
that the estimate by the United Nations agencies was based on the
growth rate from the faulty 1963 census figure.
</P>
<P>
They should use the results of the country's 1991 census,
which indicated a population of 88,992,220 and an annual growth
rate of 2.83 percent, he continued, adding that the mistake was
deliberate.
</P>
<P>
The chairman admitted that there are controversies concerning
the census, noting they were mainly concerning those abroad who
were not counted.
</P>
<P>
He also quoted the examples of the United Kingdom and Germany,
saying that there is no census that is not controversial.
</P>
<P>
Ugokwe denied that Nigeria is over-populated or that the
population is growing faster than necessary, though he recognized
the need for control so that over-population will not occur.
</P>
<P>
He explained that while there has been an improvement in the
registration of child births by Nigerians, the registration of
deaths is still a problem as people do not care to do it.
</P>
<P>
He added that his commission has started preparations for the
2001 census.

<HEADLINE> Albright May Visit Egypt during Mideast Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright might visit Egypt within her expected Mideast tour due to
start late this month, a diplomatic source in Cairo said.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East News Agency (MENA) of Egypt quoted the source
as saying that there is increasing possibility that Albright visit
Egypt as part of a U.S. effort to contain the present crisis
facing the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The possibility of Albright's visiting Egypt during her
proposed Mideast tour depends on how far Dennis Ross, the
U.S. peace envoy, will succeed in his current mission in in the
region, and how far he will get the peace process out of the
deadlock it has been put into," the source said.
</P>
<P>
The source affirmed that Ross's mission does basically focus on
containing the effects of the recent Jerusalem suicide bombings
which claimed 15 lives and on brokering some sort of security
cooperation between Israel and the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> China's Economic Structure Improving (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- China's economic structure,
mainly that of its industries, has been improving in the past six
years especially since the 14th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The improvement has been marked by a steady transition and the
switch from light to heavy industrialization, according to a
recent report by the State Statistics Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
China's gross national product (GNP) increased at an average
rate of 12.1 percent annually during the period, with the primary
industry rising by 4.7 percent in value-added output, the
secondary industry by 17.1 percent, and the service sector by 9.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of the value-added output produced by the three
industries changed from 24.5, 42.1, 33.4 in 1991, to 20, 48.9,
31.1 in 1996. The employment figure increased by 40.51 million,
with a rise of 3.13 million in the secondary industry, 56.54
million in the service sector, but a drop of 39.16 million in the
primary industry.
</P>
<P>
The SSB report said these changes represent the speedy progress
of the country's effort to industrialize itself, with the
secondary industry, especially the industrial sector, becoming the
major contributor to the economy.
</P>
<P>
Of the total value-added output in 1996, the secondary industry
accounted for more than half, 85.2 percent of which came from
industrial production. During the six years, production in the
primary and service sectors fell by 6.8 percent, while the
secondary industry increased by the same percentage.
</P>
<P>
The steady rise of the secondary industry in the nation's
economy, most notably a sustainable and rapid increase of
industrial production, indicates that China's industrialization
has become more advanced.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Seoul Mayor to Run for Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Mayor of Seoul, Cho Soon, has
decided to run for the country's presidency, representing the
Democratic Party (DP), the former president of the minor
opposition party, Lee Ki-taek, said today.
</P>
<P>
Lee said Cho Soon asked the DP on Sunday to postpone its
national convention to nominate its presidential candidate. "The
request means Cho has solidified his bid to run as the DP's
candidate."
</P>
<P>
After a high-level meeting, DP officials said today the party
supported the bid of Cho, who told a staff meeting of the City
Hall today that he would leave his present office to campaign for
the presidency in December.
</P>
<P>
The main rivals facing the DP candidate are Lee Hoi-chang of
the ruling New Korea Party, veteran politician Kim Dae-jung
representing the National Congress for New Politics, and Kim
Jong-pil of the United Liberal Democrats.

<TEXT>
<P>
The proportion of heavy industry in industrial production has
been growing steadily, standing at 53.9 percent last year and
representing a shift from a system dominated by light industry in
the 1980s to present-day heavy industry-oriented structure.
</P>
<P>
Over the past six years, both the output value ratio between
the three industries and that of their own has been greatly
improved. Although the primary industry's proportion has declined
somewhat, the total agricultural supply and demand has maintained
a level growth.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the practice of diversifying businesses in rural
areas has proved successful, with animal husbandry and fisheries
playing a bigger role in these regions.
</P>
<P>
The service sector has become a leader in employing surplus
labor forces, while the booming real estate, banking and insurance
fields are promoting the diversification of the sector and moving
it to a higher level.
</P>
<P>
The SSB report also pointed out four problems that have
surfaced in China's economic structure:
</P>
<P>
-- Agriculture remains the weak link in the national economy;
</P>
<P>
-- The industrial sector, though a major contributor, needs to
make internal improvements;
</P>
<P>
-- The service sector is relatively inefficient, its internal
structure needs to be revamped, and more importantly, the total
supply and demand is insufficient; and
</P>
<P>
-- Regional industrial structures are developing in a copycat
fashion.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Stock Market Active in First Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's stock market recorded
an impressive performance in the first half of the year, in terms
of market capitalization, all-share index, deals, turnover and
foreign portfolio investment, The Guardian reported today.
</P>
<P>
It quoted a release of the Nigerian stock exchange on Friday
as saying that the total value of securities listed on the
exchange appreciated by 33 percent in the first six months to
stand at 380.5 billion Naira (about 4.5 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
This was compared to 285.6 billion Naira (about 3.4 billion
dollars) at the begining of the year and an increase of 29
percent in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, a total of 31,710 deals for 672.5 million
shares worth of 5.8 billion Naira (about 69 million dollars) were
executed on the six trading floors of the exchange, namely in
Lagos, Kaduna, Ibadan, Port Harcourt and two other cities.
</P>
<P>
The release attributed the buoyant trading to the introduction
of a central securities clearing system.
</P>
<P>
The exchange's all-share index stood at 8,459.29, 21 percent
up from the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
"The Nigerian stock market remains attractive to foreign
portfolio investors who are now going beyond inquiries to
actually invest in the market," the release said.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, foreign currency transactions valued at 8.6
million dollars have been effected, 79.2 percent more than the
4.8 million dollars in the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months, the exchange approved eight new
issues with a total market value of 1.2 billion Naira (about 14
million dollars).

<P>
CANBERRA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
followed the lead of Wall Street to close sharply lower as sellers
sought to avoid the downward U.S. outlook and the local bond
market faltered.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index closed down 44.2 points or 1.63
percent at 2,667.2 after Wall Street fell almost two percent on
Friday night as a result of profit-taking prompted by inflation
fears.
</P>
<P>
"The market has reacted to Wall Street today and there was
quite a bit of selling in the mid-afternoon," Clint Smith from
Peake Lands Kirwan said.
</P>
<P>
"This market has three or four weeks to run and I can see
another 40 points off the market," Stuart Smith from Henderson
Charlton Jones said.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index fell 82.8 points to 4,301.0, with
News Corp, one of the major casualties, and ordinary shares down
15 cents at 5.92 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The banking sector fell generally in line with the market.
</P>
<P>
National Australia Bank fell 34 cents, Westpac Bank was 10
cents lower, ANZ dropped 21 cents while Commonwealth Bank was 17
cents lower.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index fell 12.3 points to 1,392.1, but
bellwether BHP was surprisingly light in trade and avoided the
market dip despite recent boardroom upheaval.
</P>
<P>
BHP recovered from an early morning low of 16.7 to close two
cents firmer at 17.01 on turnover of 5.7 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Gold stocks stood out against the market, with the index rising
5.3 points to 1,288.9 and bullion closing at 326.55 US dollars per
ounce compared to Friday's close of 322.05 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 294.08 million shares worth 836.16

Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- At least 175 people were killed in the past several days in
Algeria in collective massacres of villagers and in bombing attacks
assumably committed by Islamic extremists. These new killings have
brought to 800 the number of people killed since the legislative
election on June 5.
</P>
<P>

the security of Israel, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Sunday made
his first concession to U.S. Middle East coordinator Denis Ross by
agreeing to cooperate with Israel in security matters, on the
condition that the Americans also participate in it.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Seeks Investment Safety in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said today it
would participate in the reconstruction of Bosnia-Herzegovina but
added that the Malaysian private sector is still not very
confident in Bosnia's stability at present time.
</P>
<P>
During talks with visiting Co-Chairmen of the Council of
Ministers of Bosnia Haris Siladjzic and Boro Bosic, Malaysian
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad sought an assurance from the
Bosnian government that Malaysians' businesses and investments in
the Balkan state will be safeguarded and given attention by the
authorities there, Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad
Badawi told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir in the talks also expressed the hope that all
conditions under the Dayton Peace Accord on Bosnia would be met by
all parties in the Balkan state, Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir told the two Bosnian leaders that it was essential for
all factions to observe the peace accord to ensure that the
situation in Bosnia return to normal and the peace and political
stability prevail, the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister stressed that if this could be achieved, it
would be easier for Bosnia to obtain assistance like investment
and cooperation in the economic field and forge ties in trade and
other fields with the international community including Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir asked the Bosnian government to take positive measures
to further boost the confidence of Malaysian businessmen so that
they would increase the volume of their investment there.
</P>
<P>
The two Bosnian leaders said it was the desire of Bosnia to
provide protection besides encouraging investments from abroad in
line with efforts to forge trade ties.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said both Siladjzic and Bosic agreed that their
country should learn from Malaysia's experience.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has identified assistance for projects worth 12
million ringgit (about 4.6 million U.S. dollars) to be implemented
around the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo. The projects are expected
to be completed within a year. Several projects related to health
and agriculture would be launched in a few months, according to
officials here.
</P>
<P>
The two Bosnian leaders arrived here Sunday for a four-day
visit to Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> KAL Crash Results in Cancellation of Overseas Trips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The tragic crash of a South Korean
Air (KAL) plane in Guam, the United States, has resulted in
increasing cancellations of South Korean travellers' overseas
trips, according to an investigation by the Ministry of Culture
and Sports.
</P>
<P>
Of 54,450 South Koreans who made reservations for oveaseas
trips at the nation's top 15 travel agencies to the end of this
month, 2,927 surveyed have scratched their plans in the wake of
the KAL crash.
</P>
<P>
"In our survey on reservation cancellations after the mishap,
the cancellation rate stood at about 5.4 percent," the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry pointed out that the cancellation rate, which
means five out of every 100 of travelers cancelled their
schedules, is considerably high, given that August is the apex of
the tourist season.
</P>
<P>
It was analysed that the travelers who cancelled their plans
apprently fear they could be the next victim of an air accident.
</P>
<P>
A KAL Boeing 747 plane with 254 on board crashed and burned on
August 6 in Guam. Only about 30 have survived the crash.
</P>
<P>
The trend of cancellation is expected to continue for the time
being as shockwaves are felt nationwide from the KAL tragedy, it
added.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Cellular Phone Industry Grows Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Cellular telephones are
penetrating the densely populated townships in South Africa,
providing a quick and effective way to reach the millions of
people, local daily Business Day reported today.
</P>
<P>
The cellular phones are made available through a community
phone program run by MTN and Vodacom, the industry giants in the
country. As part of their contracts, the government requires the
two companies to provide facilities to under-privileged areas and
to charge subsidized rates to consumers, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Cellular telephones were introduced to South Africa in 1994.
Since then they have proved so successful that they rival the
rate of fixed telephones.
</P>
<P>
The cellular phone industry has attained one million
subscribers in the past three years, which is among the highest
growth rates in the world, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to achievement in the cellular phone industry, the
state-owned telephone company Telkom has also rolled out four
million lines to South Africans since 1994.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is believed to be the most developed country in
telecommunication industry in Africa. Nonetheless, many of South
Africa's 37.9 million people have never made a phone call, let
alone owned one.
</P>
<P>
On average, there are about 10 telephone lines per 100 people
in South Africa. However in the affluent areas, the rate can be
as high as 45 lines per 100 people as against the 0.1 line per
100 people in the impoverished rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Telkom has vowed to spend between 7.82 billion and 11.7
billion U.S. Dollars on expanding the network. The plan will
include doubling connections to 9.3 million lines by the year
2005.
</P>
<P>
About 120,000 public telephones are within this blueprint and
1.7 million lines are targeted for rural consumers, said Mac
Geschwind, chief operating official of Telkom.

<HEADLINE> Fujian to Accelerate Development of Rural Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Fujian Province in east China has
mapped out a plan to boost the development of rural enterprises,
the local economic pillar.
</P>
<P>
From now to the year 2000, the value-added output of the rural
enterprises is expected to increase by an average of 15 percent
annually and ultimately reach 140 billion yuan (about 16.87
billion US dollars), according to the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the value-added industrial output is to come to 93
billion yuan (about 1.12 billion US dollars), with that of exports
standing at 100 billion yuan (about 1.20 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
To make this happen, Fujian will allocate 50 million yuan
(about 6.02 million US dollars) in funding for the upgrading of
the rural enterprises, and will give them an additional five
million yuan (about 602,400 US dollars) every year.
</P>
<P>
The property rights system now operating in the rural
enterprises will be overhauled, with large companies changing into
limited liability corporations and small ones becoming cooperative
shareholding companies.
</P>
<P>
The government is encouraging the enterprises to use foreign
capital to improve major products.
</P>
<P>
Fujian also will allocate five million yuan (about 602,400 US
dollars) to the enterprises for technological renovation, and is
urging them to use advanced equipment and establish their own
research institutes.
</P>
<P>
Rural enterprises got their start in Fujian 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, the total output value of the rural
enterprises in the province had reached 293.063 billion yuan
(about 35.308 billion US dollars) and the total exports hit 54.84
billion yuan (about 7.089 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
One-third of the total value-added output of the province and
three-fifths of the income of the farmers came from rural
enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Artificial Rain Brings Relief to Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- By the end of July, artificial
rainfall had brought more than 200 million cu m of precipitation
to the upper reaches of the Yellow River in northwest China's
Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
Drought conditions since the 1990s have sharply decreased the
flow volume of the Yellow River, China's second longest river,
affecting the economic development and lives of the residents
living on the riverbanks.
</P>
<P>
The Qinghai Meteorological Bureau has been working with the
Qinghai Power Bureau since late April to produce rain by
artificial means in an area of 30,000 sq km along the upper
reaches of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
When weather conditions are suitable for rainfall, chemicals
can be released into the clouds by plane.
</P>
<P>
The rainmaking operation is expected to last until the end of
September. Its goal is to increase precipitation by 480 million cu
m, about 2.2 percent of the yearly flow of the river across
Qinghai Province.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Wipes out Budget Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
recorded a 42 billion Kwacha (about 32 million U.S. Dollars)
budget surplus for the second quarter of the year compared to
12.5 billion Kwacha (about 9.6 million dollars) budget deficit in
the first quarter, the Zambia Daily Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted Finance Minister Ronald Penza as
explaining that there was a remarkable improvement in the
collection of value added tax (VAT) while import tax collection
had also increased.
</P>
<P>
He said 34 billion Kwacha (about 26 million dollars) was
collected in the second quarter in customs duty as against 22.8
billion Kwacha (about 17.5 million dollars) in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Excise duty, domestic VAT, fees and fines collections also
showed dramatic improvement which accounted for the positive
budget surplus during the second quarter, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed his concern over the huge civil service
wage bill which may disturb the budget, but explained that
besides salaries, the government is capable of paying other perks
to be awarded to public workers if the system is managed well.
</P>
<P>
A quarterly report by the Zambia Chambers of Commerce and
Industry indicates that the most notable domestic expenditure
during the second quarter of this year was that of wages and
salaries totaling 88.8 billion Kwacha (about 68 million dollars)
compared to 65.9 billion Kwacha (about 50.7 million dollars)
during the first three months.
</P>
<P>
"Should the Civil Servants Union of Zambia clinch another
salary increase during their anticipated wage talks with the
government this year, the total wage bill will go through the
roof," Penza said.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Mine Owners to Pay More for Electricity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia Electricity Supply
Corporation (ZESCO) will not allow the current subsidized rate to
mines to continue, according to Zambia Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the mining firms to take over Zambia Consolidated
Copper Mines (ZCCM) which are currently on sale will have to pay
about 75 percent more for their electricity consumption.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted Water and Energy Minister Suresh
Desai as saying on Sunday that the ZCCM consumes about 70 percent
of the country's electricity and has so far been paying
uneconomic rates for power which has adversely affected ZESCO
operations, forcing it to charge high rates for domestic
consumers.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that once the new owners of the mines take over,
ZESCO will charge realistic tariffs and reduce tariffs on
domestic users and agricultural sector.

<HEADLINE> Liberian Cabinet Complete, Awaiting Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- President Charles Taylor of
Liberia has completed the building of the 19-member cabinet of
his new government with Sunday's nomination of the last minister.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here today, Taylor appointed
Fineboy Darkiwah as minister of health and social welfare,
putting the final touch to cabinet establishment.
</P>
<P>
A government statement said the newly installed 26-member
senate would have to confirm all the nominations made so far
although all are said to have been on the job already.
</P>
<P>
It is anticipated that all the nominees will pass the senate
hearing, the time for which is unknown presently, as Taylor's
National Patriotic Party (NPP) has 21 of the 26 seats in the
senate.
</P>
<P>
Taylor has also nominated five other NPP persons to posts with
cabinet member equivalence, including governor of the central
bank, commissioner of maritime affairs, and managing directors of
Liberia telecommunications corporation, forestry development
authority and Liberia electricity corporation.
</P>
<P>
Among the 19 ministers named, at least three are Taylor's
former rivals in the seven-year civil war, and their inclusion is
seen as a sign of Taylor's promise to forge unity and encourage
reconciliation in the war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet also consists of at least six persons who had
served in previous governments from William Tolbert's regime to
the Ruth Perry-led council of state, the provisional ruling body
before Yaylor's inauguration.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a report from Monrovia, capital of Liberia, quoted
a spokesman for Taylor as saying that the president is planning
state funeral for former president Tolbert who was killed in a
military coup in 1980.
</P>
<P>
There is also report that Taylor is to re-bury former
president Samuel Doe, the leader of the 1980 coup who later was
tortured to death during the bitter civil war triggered by
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
The reported funeral is also regarded as part of the efforts
for post-war reconciliation after Taylor's overwhelming victory
in last month's election.
</P>
<P>
But Taylor's critics have pointed out that re-burying could
not be the most important task the warlord-turned president could
utilize time, money and energy on.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders in the country were said to have equally
criticized Taylor's appointments into cabinet positions, saying
that his choice of ministers does not have national spread.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they said that the plan for proportional
representation in the legislature has been messed up by the size
of Taylor's party.
</P>
<P>
The opposition warned that the new president's policies should
be tailored towards encouraging Liberians rather than further
frustrateing them.

<HEADLINE> Large Group of Ancient Tombs Found in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-four ancient tombs
dating from the Han Dynasty about 2,000 years ago have been
located at a highway construction site by archaeologists in
northeast China's Liaoning province.
</P>
<P>
Most of the excavated tombs are one-room brick burial chambers,
according to the archaeologists. Funerary objects were found on
tables placed behind the burial beds, and several passageways
winding through the site were discovered.
</P>
<P>
Also unearthed were a dozen bronze coins of the Han Dynasty and
many burial objects, mostly earthenware.
</P>
<P>
The archaeologists said that more items might have been found
if grave robbers had not plundered the site throughout history.
</P>
<P>
Xin Zhanshan, director of the Liaoning Institute of Relics and
Archaeology, said that never before have so many tombs from the
Han Dynasty been found in the western area of Liaoning. He said
he believes that more ancient tombs have yet to be found in the
area.
</P>
<P>
The site can provide useful information for research on burial
customs of the Han Dynasty.

<HEADLINE> Polo Originated in Tibet, Researcher Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese scholar who specializes
in Tibetan research claims that the Western sport of polo
originated in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Polo, known as the "Game of Kings," was developed by ancient
Tibetans and later spread to Central Asia and Europe, Wang Yao
explains in his newly-published paper entitled "A New Study on
Polo."
</P>
<P>
The earliest Tibetan lexicon, dating back more than 1,000
years, provides corroborating evidence for polo's true beginnings,
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
German American researcher B. Laufer, who also focuses on
Tibetan studies, said that the compilers of "The Century
Dictionary" and "Encyclopedia Britannica" regarded "polo" as an
ancient Tibetan word.
</P>
<P>
And "The New History of the Tang Dynasty" has recorded that
Tibetan dukes and princes gave treasures, including gold polo
mallets, to the emperor of the Tang Dynasty when asking to marry
into the royal family.
</P>
<P>
Ancient Tibetan people were renowned for their advanced polo
skills, according to the experts. The sport became particularly
popular in the capital city, Chang'an, of the Tang Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
He cited a Chinese history book which recorded interesting
games between Tang warriors and Tibetan envoys. After a streak of
losses, the emperor sent into the game a prince who showed off his
athletic prowess and led his team to victory.
</P>
<P>
Professor Han Guopan claimed that Tibetans liked playing polo
and people of the Han nationality studied the sport from Tibetans.

NAIROBI, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's ruling party Kenya
African National Union (KANU) continues to blame the opposition
for the deaths of three men, two of them police, during the

Earlier, Kenyan Police Commissioner Duncan Wachira ordered for
a countrywide crackdown on all forms of lawlessness and launched
a major manhunt for the killers of two police officers.

In a statement issued here on Saturday, the police boss said
that all acts of lawlessness would be met with the full force of
the law. Wachira had ordered his men to deal "firmly" with anyone
involved in lawless activities.

<HEADLINE> White Tortoise Returns to Wild in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A white tortoise which had
been cared for by humans for 13 years in Huaiyang county in
central China's Henan Province was set free last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On August 14, 1984, a local boy who was fishing in a lake
caught a white tortoise by mistake. The 650-gram female was a
milky-white color, and according to an expert, was about 250 years
old.
</P>
<P>
So the county built a shed for it that approximated the natural
environment, and assigned personnel to take care of it.
</P>
<P>
In the past 13 years, the weight of the tortoise has increased
50 grams, and although it has laid 24 eggs, no tortoises have
hatched, because the eggs were not fertilized.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of people have visited the white tortoise,
but in order to give it a more natural life and to allow it to
breed, the county authorities sent it back to the lake where it
was caught.

<HEADLINE> Gurkhas Threaten to Sue British Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The retired British Gurkha
soldiers has threatened that if the British government does not
meet their demand for equal treatment, they will drag it to the
court, Nepali newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing some 800 ex-Gurkha army and their families Sunday,
President of the Gorkha Army Ex-Servicemen Organization (GAESO)
Padam Bahadur Gurung said that they will wait for a dialog between
the governments of Nepal and Britain, if that does not materialize
or fail to address their grievances, they will go to London
courts.
</P>
<P>
A team of Ex-Gurkha officers, politicians and human rights
workers visited London recently and met with British politicians
and human rights activists.
</P>
<P>
"We talked with lawyers there who have assured that our case is
strong. A barrister is coming here soon to prepare and gather
necessary documents," Gurung said.
</P>
<P>
The GAESO threatened late last year that it would file a case
in a British court against the British government to fight the
"discrimination" meted to the Gurkhas if the issue is not settled
on governmental level by April 1997.
</P>
<P>
The demands raised by the GAESO include pension to the 10,000
Gurkhas who were sent back to Nepal after the Second World War and
the war between Malaysia and Indonesia in 1968.
</P>
<P>
The organization argued that about 70 percent of these Gurkha
soldiers have died, but their families are left without the
pension.
</P>
<P>
The second demand is to provide pensions for the Gurkhas on par
with their British counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Many Gurkhas receive as little as 24 pounds a month while the
British get 475 pounds, they said.
</P>
<P>
The organization also demand the rights for the British Gurkhas
to live and work in Britain after retirement.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed in 1947 between Britain, India and
Nepal, the British and Indian armies can recruit Nepalese, who are
called the Gurkha soldiers.

XI'AN, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The number of China's crested ibis
has gone above 100, as against only seven in 1981, when the country
first found the very rare birds in inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Some of the birds flew south from Yangxian County in northwest
China's Shaanxi Province, and members of an ibis protection center
have successfully bred 28 crested ibises during the reproduction
period this spring, 21 of which are healthy and doing fine and
four young birds are well taken care of in the center's clinic.
</P>
<P>
In the arid summer, more than 30 members of the protection
center watched ten crested ibises around the clock and helped two
pairs of mature ibises change nests, ensuring reproduction.
</P>
<P>
They also took back three abandoned ibis eggs for further
observation and breeding, producing two young birds.
</P>
<P>
With the help of local farmers, they found new water sources
and planted 1,200 kg of loaches for the precious birds to feed on.
</P>
<P>
Crested ibises are found only in China and Japan. China listed
the crested ibis as a protected species in 1983, and 37 ibises
were reported in the country in a 1993 study.

established criteria, said SET President Singh Tangtatswas on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Singh said that he will be the first SET president in Thailand
to remove unqualified public firms from the market.
</P>
<P>
The stock market has seen voluntary withdrawals of three firms
and some others will be delisted soon, he was quoted as saying by
local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The Thai stock market is introducing new regulations to ensure

<HEADLINE> Chinese Large State Enterprises Look to New Issuances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Issuance of new A shares will
help China's large State-owned enterprises with their stock
structure, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The English-language newspaper reported that a recent general
meeting of Hong Hong-and-Shenzhen-listed Jilin Chemical Co Ltd
proposed to issue 300 million new A shares.
</P>
<P>
If approved by the government, the issuance will be the first
of its kind in China's securities market.
</P>
<P>
The company had issued 960 million H shares and 50 million A
shares with total stock capital of 3.4 billion yuan (409 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The China Securities Regulatory Commission has also confirmed
that among this year's 30 billion yuan worth of new shares issuing
quota, some will be used by large State-owned enterprises to issue
new A shares.
</P>
<P>
The increased A-share issuance will help listed State
enterprises to raise more funds while also improving the stock
structure of such companies.
</P>
<P>
An analysis in the newspaper "China Securities" said some
companies listed in both Hong Kong and domestic exchanges have a
"typical irrational stock structure," meaning that they generally
have big total capital stock but a small volume of A shares in
circulation.
</P>
<P>
This can easily lead to manipulation in the stock market if
investors try to control the composite index through buying and
selling shares in such companies.
</P>
<P>
The "China Securities" analysis said that the new A shares
issued by large State-owned enterprises will be characterized by
large volume and low price.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The recent closure of 42 ailing
finance firms by the Thai government is hurting the local car
market and sales could lower to 400,000 units this year from the
previous prediction of 460,000 units.
</P>
<P>
The local car market this year will face difficulties due to
the shutdown of the 42 finance firms and the 16 ones suspended
earlier, according to a report from the automotive club under the
Thai Industries Federation available today.
</P>
<P>
Some customers could not afford to car purchases due to the
lack of support from finance firms, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Because of the sluggishness on the domestic market, some
companies, like Mitsubishi, Toyota and Honda, have turned to the
export market.
</P>
<P>
The export volume for this year is expected to exceed 45,000
units, according to the report.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A regulation aimed to help
prevent earthquakes and improve disaster-relief work in east
China's Fujian Province has been drafted by local legislator.
</P>
<P>
The move was prompted by minor or medium quakes repeatedly
metered in the province over recent years, according to a report
in today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
Fujian is among the regions in the country most prone to
earthquakes because it is located in the earthquake belt that
entails the southeast coast and is close to Taiwan, which is in
the Pacific region that has the most dynamic seismic activity in
the world.
</P>
<P>
A recent quake on May 30 in Yong'an County, measured 5.2
degrees on the Richter scale, caused direct economic losses as
high as 73.5 million yuan (8.8 million US dollars), said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The province has set up an earthquake-relief system that
involves monitoring, forecasting, prevention, emergency and rescue
measures.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, legislation has also been passed in the province
providing for rules and regulations to help disaster relief.

<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The collection of levies from
mining units for the exploitation of mineral resources has been
going well this year, despite some problems, "China Daily"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based newspaper quotes Jiang Chengsong,
vice-minister of geology and mineral resources as saying that the
rate of the fee to be collected varies in proportion to the output
volume and value of the mining sector in any particular year.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, the ministry has set the collection
quota from mining units at one billion yuan (120 million US
dollars) each year. Yet the ministry failed to fill the quota in
1995, the first year the system was put into practice. The total
money collected that year was far less than the quota set by the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
The turning point came in 1996 when the one billion yuan (120
million US dollars) quota was fulfilled, ministry sources said.
</P>
<P>
As the money collected by May this year has exceeded 240
million yuan (28.9 million US dollars), almost the same amount as
in the previous year, the ministry is confident of reaching this
year's quota.

MOSCOW, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Tajik President Emomali Rkhmonov

All the conflicts should be settled through negotiations,
Rakhmonov stressed.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmonov called on servicemen of the country's armed forces
not to yield to the influence of criminal groups and to keep away
from criminal actions.
</P>
<P>
The president called on the local people to render assistance
to law-enforcement authorities to stem organized crime and armed
mafia.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council had taken measures to ensure and restore
law and order in Dushanbe and adjacent regions and in southern
districts of the Khatlon region, he said.
