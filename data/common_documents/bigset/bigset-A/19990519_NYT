 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
SAN ANTONIO _ Get ready.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That's the unspoken warning from the Lakers' locker room as they
get ready to rumble with the Spurs tonight in Game 2 of the Western
Conference semifinals at the Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   After all, if the Lake Show can be pre-empted by a night of live
tag-team wrestling, as it was Monday, then the Spurs should brace
themselves for the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs manhandled the Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal in San
Antonio's 87-81 victory in Game 1, and O'Neal isn't happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   So expect the sequel to be different when the best-of-seven
series resumes.
</P>
<P>
   Who are these new-look Spurs, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   The league's wallflowers looked more like clinging vines Monday,
throwing O'Neal into the mother of all funks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to guard Shaq is to break the rules that the NBA
is supposed to enforce,'' O'Neal said. ``But they never enforce
them, which is fine. I've been getting played like that for seven
years. But nobody's going to break me.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Spurs didn't try. With David Robinson, Tim Duncan,
Will Perdue and Malik Rose tag-teaming O'Neal into submission, or
at least as close as teams come to subduing the 7-1, 335-pound
center, the slaps on the big man's arms were so frequent it sounded
like applause.
</P>
<P>
   But the strategy worked because O'Neal was held _ and he'll tell
you that's the word _ to 21 points, far below the 29.5-point
average he had in four games against the Rockets in the opening
round.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Shaq Daddy'' intends to show the Spurs just who their
daddy is tonight, especially because O'Neal thinks the officials
didn't give him his due Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all knew what their plan was when I get it down low _ foul.
So?'' said O'Neal of the Spurs' tactics. ``But it didn't work out
like that (referees calling fouls). I think that's going to be more
to my favor because that's my style of ball.''
</P>
<P>
   So expect tonight to be something along the lines of ``Daddy
Dearest,'' with O'Neal meting out the punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson didn't see how the Lakers could get O'Neal any more
involved than he was Monday night, when he attempted 19 field goals
(making six) and 14 free throws (making nine).
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll adjust some,'' Robinson said. ``They're definitely
going to get some other players involved. It's hard to say. Shaq
posted up really hard in that game. I thought he was very
aggressive, and I thought that he came down and got low-post
position and they went to him a lot. I don't know what their
philosophy (will be in Game 2), but they definitely went to Shaq
(Monday).''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was irritated that referees Steve Javie, Ron Garretson
and Joe DeRosa didn't go to him more often, as in sending him to
the foul line.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal stalked Javie after the game spewing his gripes (almost
everyone's story) or holding his tongue (O'Neal's version).
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get a chance to say anything to him,'' O'Neal said.
``I didn't have to say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. Besides, the Lakers spent most of Tuesday saying it
for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see on the tapes where Shaq is getting fouled, but
they (the referees) didn't do anything about it,'' said the Lakers'
Robert Horry. ``Those two (Robinson and Duncan) are the `Golden
Boys,' though.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the Spurs are going to get physical, the Lakers _ and
O'Neal in particular _ will respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to have to play (the same way),'' O'Neal said.
``Hopefully they (the refs) will let both teams play physical.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (Monday's game) was not physical. Where I've been,
they're more physical. That's not physical at all. It was just
another day at the office for me.''
</P>
<P>
   It is funny hearing the Lakers complain about rough play,
because guys like O'Neal, J.R. Reid and Derek Harper are among the
more physical players at their positions. But they discovered the
Spurs can play that way, too.
</P>
<P>
   And so did the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can play physical ball,'' Mario Elie said. ``We can get up
and play defense against the best of them. Against Shaq (Monday),
we threw everything but the kitchen sink at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Expect the kitchen sink to be next.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it goes on, I think it will get more physical,'' Robinson
said. ``That's just the nature of the playoffs, especially as you
get to Games 4, 5, 6 and 7. That (more physical play) is what is
going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you still have to play basketball. You have to play. The
defense has to be good, the rotations have to be good, and
offensively we're going to have to execute. That first game is
always that feeling-out game. You have to get a feel for what
they're going to do and what you want to do. We saw some good
things that worked, so we're going to try and improve upon those.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game plan was to make him work a little bit, and then when
he puts it on the floor, to try and help out. But he has good
quickness and he makes some pretty good, quick moves into the
middle and toward the baseline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were more fortunate than anything else. Like I
said, it's just a real feeling-out process right now. We're trying
to get a feel for what we want to do, and (Monday) wasn't exactly
how it's going to end up, but we saw some good things.''

BREWERS DEFEAT METS, 4-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Armando Benitez was not going to give in and throw
his second-best pitch. He surely remembered the devastating home
run Marquis Grissom had hit off him in the 1997 American League
Championship Series, when Benitez was with Baltimore and Grissom
was with Cleveland, and Grissom hit a slider for a home run to win
Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, the stakes were not nearly so high, and the
teams were different. But Benitez, now a New York Mets reliever,
was facing Grissom, a Milwaukee Brewer, with a game on the line.
And if Grissom was going to beat him this time, he was going to
have to hit a fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Grissom did, hammering a 95-mile-an-hour fastball over the fence
in left field for a three-run home run with two out in the eighth
inning. It enabled the Brewers to rally for a 4-2 victory over the
Mets at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   This home run and third straight loss did not cost the Mets
(21-18) a pennant, but they were costly nonetheless. Before Dennis
Cook (5-1) had come on to begin the eighth with a 2-1 lead, Rick
Reed had turned in a beleaguered rotation's strongest starting
performance in 10 days. In the process, Reed had been exonerated of
the assertion by Milwaukee Manager Phil Garner and right fielder
Jeromy Burnitz that he was doctoring the ball.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Reed's best outing of the season _ one run in seven
innings _ went for naught.
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud's run-scoring single in the fifth was still holding
up when the turnaround came. Brian Banks beat out a bunt single to
open the eighth off Cook. Burnitz followed by singling up the
middle just past a diving Edgardo Alfonzo, giving the Brewers men
on first and third and nobody out.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Valentine called for Benitez, who had struck out
29 batters in 19 innings. And the Mets badly needed a strikeout.
Benitez responded with not one, but two, as he mixed up his pitches
and fanned both Jeff Cirillo and Dave Nilsson on three pitches
each. But then came Grissom's turn. Benitez threw five pitches, all
fastballs. And on a 3-1 count, Grissom _ who nearly had to be
removed from the game after crashing into the center field fence on
Alfonzo's fifth-inning double _ blasted the game-winning home run,
his third of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Since they ran off six straight victories from April 28 to May
3, the Mets have lost 9 of 13 games. &QL;

OSUNA MUST HAVE SURGERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If Los Angeles Dodgers right-hander Antonio Osuna
had done what was originally asked by the team, he'd be
approximately halfway through his rehabilitation. Instead, his
targeted return date is Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna will have arthroscopic surgery on his right elbow to
remove a bone spur Thursday at Centinela Hospital Medical Center.
Osuna was placed on the 15-day disabled list Tuesday, retroactive
to Monday, his third trip there this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the bottom line came in the game (Sunday),'' Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson said. ``The first pitch, and in a jam, was 88
(mph) and his next one was 88. He let it go and it went to 90, but
he said he felt (pain) on the fastball. That was it for me and for
(pitching coach) Charlie (Hough).''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also sent nonhitting catcher Paul Lo Duca to
Triple-A Albuquerque and recalled catching prospect Angel Pena and
outfielder Trenidad Hubbard. It gives the Dodgers 11 pitchers, five
outfielders, seven infielders and two catchers, and both were in
uniform against the Houston Astros at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson tried to use Osuna sporadically to allow the pitcher
time to recover between outings, but it had an adverse effect on
the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last few outings, I was not good at all,'' said Osuna, who
has a 7.71 ERA in five games. ``Lately, it was bothering me a lot.
My speed went down a lot and I couldn't do anything with my
fastball. That's why I agreed (to have the surgery). I don't have
any regrets because (when I skipped the surgery) I thought I could
have pitched without the operation.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgery was first recommended April 21 by Dodgers team
physician and elbow guru Dr. Frank Jobe. Osuna, who had a bone spur
and bone chips removed in the same elbow in September, agreed to
have the surgery then but changed his mind on the drive back from
the doctor's office. Jobe and Dr. Ralph Gambardella will perform
the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson raised the issue of Osuna's health after a May 11 loss
to the Chicago Cubs. Osuna yielded four runs in a third of an
inning, and afterward Johnson questioned his velocity.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said he spoke with Osuna's
agent, Rocky Hall, last week, but the decision was made by Osuna
during a visit to Mexico on Monday to see his father, who recently
had hernia surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have him 100 percent for the last two months of the
season than 75 percent for the rest of the season,'' Malone said.
``I think every time he went out there, depending on his
performance or velocity, there were going to be questions. This
way, we'll get him fixed and rehabilitate him and he'll be back.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Osuna chronicles have apparently ended, the backup
catching situation is now intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Malone both said Lo Duca, who was 2 for 36 (.056),
was sent down to get his timing back on offense. If Pena doesn't
perform in a backup role, he and Lo Duca could spent the rest of
the season passing each other on the Albuquerque Shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we see Angel getting rusty and ineffective, we'll send
him back,'' Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   Pena was hitting .284 with 17 RBI at Triple-A, but several
Dodgers officials were worried that he was losing interest since he
wasn't at the major-league level.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard, who hit .298 last season with the Dodgers, batted .322
with five homers, 24 RBI and 14 stolen bases with Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Extra bases: Tripp Cromer made his first start of the season. He
played second in place of Eric Young, who was spiked Sunday in St.
Louis. The swelling in Young's ankle diminished, trainer Charlie
Strasser said, and he could return today.... With leadoff batter
Young out, Adrian Beltre batted first.... Jose Vizcaino (hamstring)
remains day-to-day.... Johnson said center fielder Devon White, who
hasn't played since May 9 because of a hamstring strain, could
return to the lineup today.... Two of the three games this weekend
against St. Louis, i.e., Mark McGwire, are sold out. Tickets remain
for Friday's game, but Saturday and Sunday are sold out.

RED SOX DEFEAT YANKEES, 6-3 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Before returning as the New York Yankees' manager on
Tuesday, Joe Torre missed his time in the dugout. He missed hearing
the voices of his players, watching their reactions closely,
analyzing their body language, all of those ways a manager measures
his team.
</P>
<P>
   But Torre had no idea that on his first night back, the Yankees
would provide enough body language to fill a semester's worth of
Psychology 101 _ from David Cone's self-loathing grimace to Scott
Brosius' monumental bat slam to Jorge Posada's woe-is-me amble.
Stranding 15 runners in a 6-3 loss to Pedro Martinez and the Boston
Red Sox would cause contortions in any player, or principal owner.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting next to the Yankees' dugout, George Steinbrenner waved
his arms disgustedly after the slumping Chuck Knoblauch committed
his seventh error.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who fell half a game behind Boston in the American
League East, have scored 11 runs in their last 54 innings, and on
Tuesday night, they were 3 for 19 with runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle innings, Torre lowered his cap so that his eyes
were almost completely hidden and leaned his head back against the
dugout wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very calm,'' he said later, plaintively. ``I wish the
result was better.''
</P>
<P>
   In losing for the sixth time in their last seven games, the
Yankees failed to capitalize on an evening when Martinez wasn't
dominating. The Boston right-hander's stuff had been electric
recently; he'd thrown nasty fastballs, changeups, curveballs, all
for strikes. But against the Yankees, he struggled to command his
curve, and his changeup sometimes drifted over the middle of the
plate. Martinez allowed 10 hits and 4 walks in his 7 innings, or 5
more base runners than he had allowed in any of his first 8 starts.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees could not finish him off. First and third, two
out in the first inning: No runs. Lead-off double in the second: No
runs. Bases loaded, one out, one run in during the fifth: No more
runs. Lead-off single in the sixth: No runs. Lead-off double in the
seventh: No runs. ``We had our hits,'' said Brosius, ``but boy,
when there were runners on base, he just seemed to take it to
another level.''
</P>
<P>
   He struck out 11, nine of those with runners in scoring
position. When Brosius struck out to close the seventh, he turned
and flung down his bat.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees did muster a 2-0 lead through the top of the fifth
inning, with Cone breezing. But when Martinez labored through a
36-pitch inning in the fifth, Cone had to wait and watch and wait,
and after returning to the mound, he just didn't have the same
quality of breaking ball or split-fingered fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanley led off by slamming a hanging slider into the left
field screen. It was this hit, Cone said, that rattled him, turning
him into a tentative pitcher. Reggie Jefferson singled home the
tying run in the same inning. Nomar Garciaparra blasted a double
off the center field wall to start the sixth, and with one out,
Cone threw a splitter that bounced off the glove of Posada, a wild
pitch; Garciaparra raced home with the go-ahead run. Cone scowled,
blaming himself, Posada hung his head and blamed himself, and Torre
saw it all.
</P>
<P>
   Torre surprised everyone other than his wife, Ali Torre, with
his decision to return on Tuesday. They went to dinner Monday
evening and discussed the possibilities, how strong he's felt
recently. ``Are you ready to do it?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I am,'' he answered directly, and on Tuesday morning, he
called the interim manager Don Zimmer at 8 a.m. and asked his own
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you ready to do the job we hired you to do?'' Torre
queried. Zimmer immediately understood the implication of what
Torre was saying, two months to the day after undergoing surgery
for prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Torre flew here with Steinbrenner, and after he arrived at the
ball park and surprised his players, Derek Jeter, the Yankees'
shortstop, plopped down in his office grinning and called him Mr.
Torre; others shook his hand. Torre, who met with his stunned
players in March to tell them about his forthcoming operation,
gathered them again on Tuesday, under far different circumstances,
telling them he was back for good, jokingly mentioning the movie
``Halloween 3'' _ ``I'm back.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre is not fully recovered. When asked on Tuesday if he will
undergo radiation for his cancer, Torre declined to be specific,
saying only that he will continue to be treated and that the
particulars are a private matter, so long as it does not cause him
to leave the team.
</P>
<P>
   Torre added that he did not anticipate missing any games as he
underwent further tests and treatment. He repeated that he felt
great, that he'd been ``champing at the bit'' to manage the Yankees
again. ``This is what I want,'' Torre said. ``I'm ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were 21-15 (.538) under Zimmer, Torre's hand-picked
replacement. It appears the 68-year-old Zimmer will stay with the
team as Torre's bench coach, rather than return to New York to rest
his aching knees. ``I'm just glad he's back,'' said Zimmer. ``I'm
just tickled to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre came out of his office and sat next to Zimmer, speaking
quietly into his left ear, placing his arm on Zimmer's shoulder.
When Torre met with the players, he decided against thanking Zimmer
in front of them; he knew Zimmer would break down.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner, who scrapped publicly with Zimmer over Hideki
Irabu at the end of spring training and barely spoke to his interim
manager since, wouldn't speak directly of Zimmer's performance.
``I'm not in a position to sit here and judge these guys,''
Steinbrenner said. ``He's got them in first place, doesn't he?''
</P>
<P>
   Torre had no intention of taking the lineup card to the field
before Tuesdasy night's game; rather, he wanted the hitting coach
Chris Chambliss go to the plate, as he usually does.
</P>
<P>
   But Zimmer suggested to Torre that he do so, and Torre joined
the umpires at home plate. Fans at Fenway Park stood and applauded,
and kept on cheering, for perhaps two minutes, and Torre raised his
cap. ``Welcome back,'' the giant screen above center field read.
</P>
<P>
   And then Torre went about the business of analyzing the body
language of a slumping, frustrated team. As Torre spoke to
reporters and the players ate silently after the loss, Steinbrenner
stood against a wall stiffly, his mouth turned downward. Welcome
back, indeed.

GAP IN PROPOSED FREEWAY ADDITIONS COULD PRODUCE MORE GRIDLOCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DOUGLAS HABERMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Caltrans is moving ahead with two lane additions
to relieve traffic congestion at the 101-405 interchange despite a
1,200-foot gap between the two projects that could create a
bottleneck, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of the work was accelerated at the urging of Gov. Gray
Davis in January, which could shave up to a year off the timetable
for the two lane additions _ one on the northbound 405 from
Mulholland Drive to the Ventura Boulevard off-ramp at Greenleaf
Street, and the other on the connector from the northbound 405 to
the eastbound 101.
</P>
<P>
   But Caltrans officials acknowledge they belatedly identified a
1,200-foot gap between the end of the extra lane on the northbound
405 and the start of the extra lane on the 101 connector ramp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody realizes that for the ultimate solution, you're
going to have to close that gap,'' said Caltrans spokesman Jim
Drago.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the two lane additions will be a net gain for
drivers even with a missing link. They said it's better to move
forward with those two projects than wait a year or longer to go
through a cumbersome planning and approval process and find funding
to bridge the gap.
</P>
<P>
   Caltrans and project proponents say the gap will create a
bottleneck.
</P>
<P>
   As long as there's a 1,200-foot missing link, motorists will
come to the end of the extra lane on the 405 northbound and be
forced to merge into the lane to the immediate left before they can
get on the connector ramp to the eastbound 101.
</P>
<P>
   But incremental projects like the two lane additions, which cost
$13.1 million, can help ease traffic congestion without waiting for
the additional time that would be required to plan and build the
$12 million missing link, Drago said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our position that the projects really stand alone,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of stories beginning in 1997, the Daily News has
focused attention on the 101-405 interchange as ground zero for
gridlock in the San Fernando Valley. Designed decades ago to handle
only a fraction of the traffic that crowds it each day, the 101-405
interchange is one of the most heavily traveled locations in the
state highway system.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, local leaders have been calling for interim
improvements as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Wally Knox, D-Los Angeles, whose district includes
the interchange, said recently that his jaw dropped when he learned
in January that there might be a gap. Once he verified there was a
missing link and understood the problem fully, he sent a letter to
Davis in April asking for his administration to fund the gap
closure, which he said preliminarily was estimated to cost $12
million.
</P>
<P>
   Knox suggested that the money be found in a $267 million
statewide transportation fund called the Interregional
Transportation Improvement Program.
</P>
<P>
   Drago said a gap-closing project is neither simple nor likely to
be cheap, because traffic is going in so many different directions
along that stretch. ``If it was easy, someone would've probably
done it by now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Caltrans must determine the best options for closing the gap and
their respective price tags, Drago said. And because any option
will affect traffic on Ventura Boulevard and the surrounding
neighborhood, a detailed environmental impact study also will be
necessary, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such a study takes at least a year because it involves analyzing
the project's likely impacts and what would have to be done to
offset them, Drago said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't design it unless you take into account what
happens on Ventura Boulevard'' as a result of the construction and
use of the additional lane, he said. The environmental analysis
also would have to examine how the extra lane would expand capacity
at the interchange, which will affect air quality, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said it makes sense to move forward with the other two
improvement projects rather than delaying them until a gap-closure
project is ready to roll.
</P>
<P>
   Nate Brogin, a San Fernando Valley civic leader who sits on the
Planning and Transportation Committee of the Southern California
Association of Governments, said the best solution might involve a
bridge at the Greenleaf Street on-ramp ``so that the on-bound
traffic is not competing'' with the traffic already on the freeway.

SHOOTING AT AFFLUENT HIGH SCHOOL EXPOSES VULNERABILITY OF CAMPUSES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Parents and students at Palisades High School said
Tuesday they thought their ocean-view campus in an affluent
neighborhood was safe from violence that is plaguing schools
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Now they say they know better, after a coach and student were
wounded in a drive-by shooting Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it happens here you realize there's no safe place to
be,'' said Sandy Mizrahi, whose daughters attend the school, which
draws children from across Los Angeles to one of the nation's most
wealthy communities. ``We're so sequestered here on this oasis.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the Colorado high school massacre, the shooting Monday
underscored for many students and parents the vulnerability of all
campuses _ even one of the safest in the Los Angeles Unified School
District by any measure.
</P>
<P>
   The drive-by attack occurred when a carload of young men fired
several times into a group of students, grazing the head football
coach in the calf and hitting a teen-ager in the thigh.
</P>
<P>
   Vontray Gardner, 18, was treated and released from Santa
Monica-UCLA Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The coach, 62-year-old Ron Price, returned to the math, science
and technology magnet school Tuesday and tried to calm jittery
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought about anyone shooting at us,'' said Price, a
teacher and coach for 33 years. ``I know what gang activity is all
about. There's just not gang activity around here.''
</P>
<P>
   While counselors talked with students and staff, detectives and
campus police were trying to determine whether the shooting was
fueled by gang rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are getting conflicting reports,'' said Detective Ron
Phillips of the Los Angeles Police Department's West Los Angeles
Division. ``We don't know the whole story.''
</P>
<P>
   Four suspects, including an adult, two Palisades High students
and a student from another school, were arrested on suspicion of
assault with a deadly weapon, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Pearce, 20, of South Central Los Angeles, is scheduled
to be arraigned today, Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   The three others _ two 15-year-olds and a 16-year-old _ were not
identified by police because of their ages. They were booked and
released to their parents, pending a juvenile court date.
</P>
<P>
   School officials told detectives they had heard the shooting
resulted from an argument over a girl.
</P>
<P>
   Palisades High School administrators plan to beef up security
throughout the week, said Linda Hosford, the acting principal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly are a quiet campus. We certainly are a safe
campus. But we have to realize that we are on the same planet and
in the same society and these things can happen,'' Hosford said.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting is scheduled for parents at 7 p.m. Monday to address
their concerns, Hosford said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Carrillo, a freshman who lives in Koreatown, said he
decided to attend Palisades High to get away from the violence that
infests schools in his own neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when something like this happens here, you're shocked,''
Carrillo said in between classes.
</P>
<P>
   After the attack across the street from the school at 15777
Bowdoin St., students said they heard young men yell that they were
part of the ``Jamaican Mafia,'' a gang whose members speak with
Jamaican accents.
</P>
<P>
   Police said witnesses gave them the account, but they have no
evidence to the claim.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting occurred during the last class of the day as about
three dozen students who do not have a sixth period waited for a
ride home, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Price noticed people gathering near a green car and went to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone started running. I started to run also,'' Price said.
``I ducked behind the handball court out of the line of fire.''
</P>
<P>
   As he hid, he recalled hearing a ``pop, pop, pop'' noise and
felt a sting below his calf, he said.

ENERGY DEPARTMENT CONTRACTORS SPENT $250 MILLION ON BUSINESS TRIPS
IN '98 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Private contractors for the Department of Energy
crisscrossed America and the world last year on more than 210,000
taxpayer-financed business trips that critics say are getting way
out of control.
</P>
<P>
   The $250 million in travel spending included a $300 hotel room
and a $1,600 airline ticket that could have been bought for a
fourth of that amount, says a recent audit by the General
Accounting Office.
</P>
<P>
   Spending by the 34 contractors, including two from Kansas City,
was up $27 million from two years earlier despite an Energy
Department goal to cut spending by $30 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unconscionable; it's unacceptable,'' said Rep. Ron
Packard, a California Republican. ``They think there's an unending
supply of money. There isn't. This simply takes money away from
projects and research and programs that are crucial.''
</P>
<P>
   The department took similar heat several years ago after
then-Secretary Hazel O'Leary spent $4.58 million on 16 overseas
trips from 1993 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may have permeated the entire agency because we now see
those same problems widespread,'' said Packard, chairman of the
House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development,
which requested the audit.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the audit, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson wrote
a letter to his staff April 14 telling it to ``act quickly and
decisively'' to reduce contractor trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``In times of limited budgets and electronic alternatives to
travel, we cannot continue such practices,'' Richardson wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The audit did point out that although the department was not
meeting its contractor travel cost reduction goals, it had exceeded
goals for cutting travel of its own employees. Its costs have
dropped by 32 percent, or about $15 million, since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The travel by private contractors is part of their duties
managing plants and supplying materials to the department. Travel
and all costs are supposed to be monitored by the department.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, O'Leary announced a downsizing plan. One goal was to
cut contractor travel costs of $261 million in 1995 by $30 million
annually. The first year, costs dropped to $222 million but then
increased to $240 million the next year and to $249 million last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to have gone back to the old ways, and I think that
it's because there are no consistent guidelines,'' Packard said.
</P>
<P>
   The rising costs have come despite a 33 percent decline in
contractor employees since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Contractors said inflation, especially in airfares, partly
accounts for the recent rise in travel spending. Another factor is
more foreign travel, especially to Russia, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City companies operate two Energy Department plants.
Midwest Research Institute oversees the National Renewable Energy
Laboratory in Colorado. In Kansas City, AlliedSignal Federal
Manufacturing and Technologies makes non-nuclear energy components.
</P>
<P>
   Midwest Research Institute spent $4.9 million on travel last
year, up from $4.8 million in 1996. AlliedSignal spent $5.4
million, up from $4.7 million 1996. Both companies say they are
aiming to cut costs. Midwest Research Institute set a goal of $4.4
million this year.
</P>
<P>
   At AlliedSignal, travel spending has dropped this year, a
spokeswoman said. It was down by about 15 percent for February and
March, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The 34 energy contractors took 213,213 trips by air, road and
rail in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 1998. About 96 percent
were domestic and about 11 percent were from contractor sites to
Washington, the audit found.
</P>
<P>
   Some contractors said many Washington trips are at the request
of the Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want reports, they want presentation, they want
interaction,'' said David Schwoegler, spokesman for the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, operated by the University of
California for the Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   Some travel spending at Lawrence Livermore was specifically
cited in the report as excessive, including $303 for a hotel room
in Monterey, Calif., and $1,602 for an airline ticket that another
person got for $414.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Lawrence Livermore employees' hotel rooms are
obtained at discounted rates, and 75 percent of airline tickets are
bought as advance fare purchases, Schwoegler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report picks out the most flagrant expenses,'' Schwoegler
said. ``It's not like we're spending flagrantly.''
</P>
<P>
   The audit is especially critical of the preference some
contractors have to buy refundable airline tickets, which are the
most expensive. Although the tickets can be refunded or changed at
no cost, nonrefundable tickets can be much cheaper and usually can
be changed by paying a $75 fee to the airline.
</P>
<P>
   Among other findings:
</P>
<P>
   Expenses were paid for some employees at Los Alamos, N.M., to
make trips related to obtaining master's degrees. In all, 24
employees made 380 trips to the University of New Mexico, about 100
miles from Los Alamos. The Energy Department later said the trips
were not justified.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 percent of all trips from 1996 to 1998 were to
conferences that cost $59 million. One trip alone, to a conference
in Vancouver, British Columbia, was attended by 520 contractor
employees at a cost of $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, about 800 contractor employees were assigned to
Washington at a cost of $76 million in salary, living allowance and
relocation costs. That number was excessive, the department found,
and the number has been cut by almost 300.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have problems,'' said Michael L. Telson, chief
financial officer for the department. ``But when you look at the
historical sweep, we are really making progress.''

RANGERS GROUND INTO FIVE DOUBLE PLAYS, FALL TO DEVIL RAYS
</HEADLINE>
 RAYS-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Twenty-two of the Texas Rangers' 43 batters
reached safely.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' lineup collected 14 hits, and designated hitter
Rafael Palmeiro drove in four runs. Right-hander Mike Morgan
pitched into the sixth inning, and the bullpen provided 3 2/3
scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   And it all went for naught.
</P>
<P>
   The double-play ground ball remains the pitcher's best friend
and the Rangers' worst enemy. Tuesday night's 5-4 loss to the Tampa
Bay Devil Rays at The Ballpark in Arlington only reinforced that
fact.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who entered yesterday's games having grounded into
a major-league-worst 41 double plays, padded their total with a
season-high five.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've hit into a lot of double plays this year,'' Rangers
manager Johnny Oates said. ``And tonight was the most noticeable of
any game we've had.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because the Rangers stranded 13 runners _ nine in scoring
position _ in the one-run loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't control the ball after you hit it,'' said catcher
Ivan Rodriguez, who grounded into his American League-high 10th and
11th double plays. ``If it goes right at them, it's going to be a
double play. There's nothing you can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing except watch as the double play sucks the life from an
inning once filled with potential.
</P>
<P>
   Devil Rays right-hander Rolando Arrojo (2-4) induced first-,
third- and fifth-inning double-play ground balls from Rodriguez,
Rusty Greer and Lee Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth-inning ground ball from Stevens kept the Rangers from
a potential big inning after Palmeiro's two-run single. Palmeiro
advanced 90 feet after Todd Zeile drew a walk, and the Devil Rays'
4-3 lead appeared in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, though, bounced into a 6-4-3 double play, and Arrojo
retired Roberto Kelly on strikes to strand Palmeiro at third base.
</P>
<P>
   ``In situations when there are runners on, I like to throw the
two-seam sinker and try to keep the ball low, and hope they hit it
on the ground,'' Arrojo said.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Esteban Yan slammed the door shut when the Rangers
threatened in the seventh inning. The Rangers scored once off
left-hander Scott Aldred, who failed to retire any of the three
batters he faced, but Yan induced a double-play ground ball from
Zeile to preserve the Devil Rays' 5-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa closer Roberto Hernandez, who pitched a scoreless ninth
inning for his 14th save, also escaped trouble by inducing the
fifth and final double-play ground ball.
</P>
<P>
   Greer opened the inning with a single, but Rodriguez bounced
into his second double play of the night. It became more painful
after Palmeiro and Zeile delivered consecutive two-out singles.
Stevens drew a walk to load the bases, but Kelly popped Hernandez's
first pitch to the mound to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any one reason,'' Oates said of the
Rangers' penchant for double-play ground balls. ``I think at times
we swing at pitchers' pitches and press with runners in scoring
position. We've also got about five guys in the lineup who don't
run very well.'' nn

REPORT SAYS PROSPERITY BYPASSING 9 MILLION U.S. CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONALD BRADLEY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ While many American families cheer the Dow
and move up to bigger homes and nicer cars, more than 9 million
children are being left behind, according to a national report
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 Kids Count report says that 13 percent of the country's
children, one in seven, are at serious risk because they are
growing up in homes where parents are poor and jobless and lack a
high school diploma.
</P>
<P>
   Ten percent of Missouri children fall into that ``high risk''
category. In Kansas, the rate is 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pocket of kids who will face tough odds the rest of
their lives. These are children being sidestepped by the booming
economy,'' Gary Brunk, executive director of Kansas Action for
Children, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Nelson, president of the Annie E. Casey Foundation, the
Baltimore-based child advocacy group that produces Kids Count, said
that although success is never guaranteed for anyone, America must
do more to see that more children have an honest chance to achieve
it.
</P>
<P>
   Kids Count used six criteria to determine these ``high-risk''
children: The head of household is a high school dropout; the
children have no health insurance; the family lives in poverty;
only one parent lives in the home; no parent works full time; or
the family receives welfare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   A child whose family meets four of the six factors was deemed
``high-risk.'' Statistics show that those household conditions
raise the likelihood that young people will drop out of school,
become teen parents or abuse drugs and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Utah had the lowest rate of high-risk children, 5 percent.
Louisiana, at 22 percent, had the highest.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Berta Sailer, director of St. Vincent's child-care center
in Kansas City, sees some of Kansas City's share every day at 6
a.m. when she opens the doors.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 200 children at St. Vincent's would be considered
``high risk,'' Sailer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no economic boom around here,'' she said. ``I can get
in a car and travel 10 minutes and see more disparity than if I'd
flown in a plane for two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what a luxury is to our families? Utilities _ and
some of them don't have that.''
</P>
<P>
   And contrary to what she believes to be a wide perception about
impoverished families, most of her parents have jobs. But it's no
longer true that vocational training and a full-time job are a
ticket to a better life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting into the work force doesn't mean getting out of
poverty,'' Sailer said. ``Sometimes, it's only enough to keep you
from sliding back.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill O'Hare, national Kids Count coordinator, said the study's
``high-risk'' findings were likely to surprise those who believe
prosperity has occurred across the demographic board.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a concentration of people in this country that the
middle-class and the well-to-do don't see,'' O'Hare said.
</P>
<P>
   Karla Myers, 36, is a mother of four who once was homeless and
recently began working at St. Vincent's as a receptionist.
</P>
<P>
   At times, she has hit all six of the high-risk factors. Her two
oldest children have dropped out of school.
</P>
<P>
   She said many high-risk parents are products of their own
upbringing, such as growing up in welfare families with parents who
didn't finish school and abused alcohol and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not using that as an excuse, because everybody can do
better if they try,'' Myers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's gotten lost here is that the best way to help
kids is to help parents. Times are great and wonderful for a lot of
people, but there is another part of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Hare said research shows that children do better when parents
do better.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 26 percent of teens with four of the six high-risk
factors were high school dropouts in 1998 compared with 1 percent
of teens with none of the risks.
</P>
<P>
   Also, 16 percent of high-risk females age 15 to 19 were teen-age
mothers, compared with only one-tenth of 1 percent of those girls
with none of the risk factors.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics show that race plays a key role in determining who is
``high-risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty percent of black children and 25 percent of Hispanic
children grow up in ``high-risk'' families, compared with 6 percent
of white children.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of ``high risk'' children live in poor areas of
central cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moving jobs to suburbs creates distressed inner-city
neighborhoods,'' O'Hare said. ``The tax base is in the suburbs, so
that's where the better schools are.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first year that Kids Count had compiled
``high-risk'' findings. Since 1990, the annual study has used 10
health, economic and social indicators to determine child
well-being in the various states.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire ranked best nationally this year in that study.
Mississippi ranked 50th. The District of Columbia was 51, getting
the lowest score in nine of the 10 areas.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri, which fell from 31st to 32nd since last year, scored
improvements in teen pregnancy and infant mortality but showed a
big jump in high school dropouts. While the national dropout rate
dropped 9 percent from 1985 to 1996, Missouri's increased by 50
percent. The dropout rate has risen to 12 percent, from 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whatever reason, a lot of our teens don't see high school
as being a part of their road map to the future,'' said Ruth
Ehresman of Citizens for Missouri's Children.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas, which fell from 15th to 18th overall, improved in the
dropout rate but registered a 69 percent increase from 1985 to 1996
in the share of children living in single-parent households, a jump
three times the national rate.

DIERKER   GETS THE LAST LAUGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Houston Astros are on their way to a third
consecutive National League Central title under Larry Dierker, and
you know what this means, don't you?
</P>
<P>
   Next Los Angeles Dodgers manager: Rick Monday.
</P>
<P>
   You laugh?
</P>
<P>
   Hey, you laughed when Dierker _ long-ago ballplayer and
long-time broadcaster _ was asked to trade in his familiar Hawaiian
shirts for an Astros jersey and his scoresheet for a lineup card
after the team finished its 10th season in a row without a division
title in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But who's laughing now?
</P>
<P>
   If the '98 NL Manager of the Year award and the affection of his
players are proof, Dierker has arrived in his first attempt at
being somebody's boss, proving a good baseball man doesn't lose his
feel for the game just because he spends 17 years watching it from
the press box.
</P>
<P>
   Most nights, Dierker even feels at home in the dugout now, much
as the old Taft High pitching and basketball star has come to feel
like a ``hybrid Texan'' after drawing an Astros paycheck for 33 of
the past 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a slow progression,'' said Dierker, who's not afraid
to admit the occasional tactical error, the admission itself
suggesting he's not fully a manager yet. ``Before this I was always
performing _ pitching or broadcasting. I didn't have people working
for me or have control over people's lives. This is a weighty
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker, 52, sat at the desk in the visiting manager's office at
Dodger Stadium three hours before the Astros' series-opening, 11-3
victory over the Dodgers on Tuesday night. A Hawaiian shirt hung in
the closet behind him.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Reseda and Woodland Hills and was a delivery boy
for the Daily News when it was called the Green Sheet. He quit that
job after two weeks when he found out how much money was to be
earned in handing out what was then a free-of-charge newspaper. His
mother, Marilyn, lives in Woodland Hills and Dierker is staying
with her this week.
</P>
<P>
   He was still a kid when he signed with the Astros and still a
kid when he pitched his first major-league game on his 18th
birthday, striking out Willie Mays in the first inning on Sept. 22,
1964. He went on to win 20 games in '69, no-hit the Montreal Expos
in '76 and set five Astros career records that still stand.
</P>
<P>
   But his playing career ended in '77, and by the time he was
appointed manager, to his and everybody else's surprise, he was no
longer an Astros ex-pitcher, he was an Astros ex-broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
   Astros management thought it had to do something different to
compete with better-financed clubs, wanted an unorthodox manager,
and got one. And the team wanted a calming influence after three
seasons of Terry Collins' intensity, and got it.
</P>
<P>
   In Dierker's let-'em-play style, starting pitchers work into the
late innings, ``lefty-righty'' bullpen and pinch-hitting moves are
rare and slumping regulars know they'll get a chance to work
through their problems on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the main thing is the trust he has in all of his
players,'' said Jack Howell, the former Angel who is the Astros'
busiest pinch-hitter. ``If I'm not swinging the bat well, he
continues to throw me out there, and that makes me feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker speaks of treating players as something more than ``game
pieces,'' personifications of statistical tendencies. He prefers
``dealing with the human element,'' of ``care and nurturing,'' of
occasionally ignoring the percentages to make the ``emotionally
stabilizing'' move.
</P>
<P>
   From the perspective of the broadcasting booth, Dierker had
observed that the majority of managers live lives of quiet
desperation. Unproven young men afraid to blow their big chances.
Tired old men worried that patience would be interpreted as
slow-wittedness.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker watched insecure managers make changes for the sake of
making changes _ to impress owners for whom the financial stakes
were rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I saw happening was that as the game changed and the
salaries grew, the managers would be armed with all these stats and
reports, and if there was any opportunity to make a move, even if
it might give you very little advantage, they'd do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you make a move and it doesn't work, then the players
failed,'' Dierker said of the way these things are viewed. ``If you
don't make a move and it doesn't work, you should have made a
move.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker learned from the surprising success of notably patient
Expos manager Buck Rodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like when we would go into Montreal, (the Expos)
always had a lefty and a righty available in the seventh, eighth,
ninth innings, and we were always out of pitchers by then,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he became a manager, having never asked for the job
in the first place, Dierker literally could afford to follow his
own unique approach. He can draw on his major league pension or
fall back on broadcasting if this doesn't work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have the sense of desperation that some guys bring to
this job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he'd better not get too comfortable. The Astros' division
titles the past two years were pleasant surprises. Now, after a
franchise-best 102 victories in '98, they're expected to run away
with the division.
</P>
<P>
   With first baseman Jeff Bagwell, second baseman Craig Biggio and
most of the pitching staff among the league leaders, the Astros are
doing it, their NL-best 24-13 record giving them a four-game lead
in the NL Central.
</P>
<P>
   At this rate, Dierker won't get kicked back upstairs anytime
soon.

MAKAH CELEBRATE WHALE HUNT, DIVIDE THE CATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE BARBER AND REBEKAH DENN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEAH BAY, Wash. _ Under an oyster-colored sky, the curious came
down to the sea Tuesday to take one last look at the whale that had
brought about the biggest celebration in the recent history of this
tiny Indian fishing village.
</P>
<P>
   After a day of joy, song and prayer _ and more protests _ the
Makah were at peace on Tuesday, enjoying the return of their
whaling heritage after more than 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   After a night of stripping the meat and blubber off the 30-foot
female whale, all that remained of the 30-ton animal caught on
Monday morning was its bony carcass. Even its powerful smell was
not enough to keep people away.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a big fish, hmmm? Can you say fish?'' fisherman Steve
Johnson murmured to his 22-month-old son, Xavier. The boy toddled
over and grasped the whale's tail, making his father smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted him to touch it ... the first whale that we
got,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first whale, but tribal members say not the last.
</P>
<P>
   Families throughout the tribe worked together to form the first
whaling crew, but now individual families plan to start up separate
whaling crews.
</P>
<P>
   Whaling captain Wayne Johnson said at least three families,
including his own, already are interested in organizing a hunt. The
timing would depend on how quickly the first whale is consumed, he
said, but he would like to have a crew start to practice for the
next hunt within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Whaling protesters vowed to return.
</P>
<P>
   The Makah _ the only tribe in the continental United States to
have whaling rights under an 1855 treaty _ may kill as many as 20
gray whales through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Whaler Donnie Swan said he knows he'll hunt on the water again.
Tuesday, though, he was happy just to sleep in after weeks of
waking before dawn to paddle out to sea in the tribe's canoe.
</P>
<P>
   Swan said he was thrilled to find the tribe's children grabbing
chunks of muktuk, or whale blubber, from his hands as fast as he
could cut it Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the little guys were saying `Cut me off a piece,' '' he
said. ``It was just awesome, hearing them say that.''
</P>
<P>
   It tasted like clam chewing gum, though some said it was
``nutty'' or ``bland.'' Others spit out their samples.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal members, supervised by an Alaska native finished
butchering the whale about 3 a.m. Tuesday. The tribe awarded the
man an eagle feather for his work. Moved, he placed it inside his
shirt, by his heart.
</P>
<P>
   The whale's skeleton was towed into the bay late Tuesday, and
sunk in a cargo net. It will be hauled up after crabs and other
creatures pick the bones clean. It will then be reassembled for the
Makah Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The families who received cuts of meat were planning how to
prepare it Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal member Richard Butler said he might smoke the 5 to 10
pounds he received. Swan said his family's cut was soaking in
water, which ``gets the wild taste out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the blocks of meat, though, were loaded into community
freezers and refrigerators, Swan said. They were taken to a plant
on the reservation, where 17 women and 11 men are using rendering
machines, meat slicers and other equipment on the blubber and meat.
Some crew members, meanwhile, have asked for pieces of the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Whaling captain Wayne Johnson said he didn't think adding whale
to the tribe's diet would be a big deal. ``We've been eating it for
thousands of years,'' he said. Depending on its purity after
rendering, the whale oil could be used for everything from
lubricating machinery to fueling stoves to garnishing food, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Neah Bay High School teacher Maureen Winn, who watched the whale
being gutted on the beach Tuesday, said she was gathering recipes
from game cookbooks and other sources, and planned to add whale
meat to her home economics course to integrate it into the Makah
diet.
</P>
<P>
   Whale meat is already on the menu for a potlatch Saturday, when
2,000 to 5,000 Indians from as far as New Mexico, Alaska and Canada
are expected to arrive and celebrate Monday's hunt as a victory for
treaty rights, said Tribal Council Chairman Ben Johnson Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal elder Helma Ward, 88, who preserved many Makah whaling
traditions and songs in her mind during the decades the tribe did
not hunt , said, ``I'm glad I lived to see this.''
</P>
<P>
   On the beach Tuesday afternoon, next to the whale bones, was the
hand-carved Hummingbird canoe used to hunt the animal. The canoe
attracted visitors, who touched it and climbed inside.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists Louise and Brian Pearce of New Zealand happened to
motor their yacht into Neah Bay Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wished we had been here the day before,'' said Brian Pearce,
a rancher. ``We'd heard about it. I think it's all a lot of hassle
over nothing. There are thousands of grey whales out there. Good
luck to the Makahs.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler asked children flocking over the canoe to photograph him
and his son, Wayne, sitting inside. Wayne Butler, who lives in
Portland, cut short a vacation and drove nine hours to Neah Bay to
see the whale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a first in my lifetime,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine, too,'' his father added.
</P>
<P>
   Children, who poured onto the beach Tuesday after hearing a
whale had been caught, said they hoped that May 17 would become a
Makah holiday. The carcass fascinated them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a bite out of the rib. It was chewy,'' said Leon
Sawyer, 12. He and buddy Blake Hill, 14, said they'd like to be
whalers and hope the school would teach courses on it.
</P>
<P>
   Rosanna Ward, 16, said, ``There are a lot of kids who look up to
basketball players and movies stars and singers, but they never get
a chance to see those kind of people here. To a lot of kids around
here who want to get a chance to see the whalers, they look like
heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   Tribal leaders, meanwhile, fielded angry messages calling them
``murderers,'' death threats and other ``abuse'' because of the
hunt, Ben Johnson Jr. said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe rejects such insults, Johnson said. ``We have a
culture, and we live by it.''

KNICKS DEFEAT HAWKS, 100-92
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On Sunday, Allan Houston sprinted defiantly down the
Miami Arena floor and punched his fist into the air after his
dramatic shot that eliminated the Heat.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the player labeled as too passive and nice, the New
York Knick who walked too slump-shouldered and unassuming, was
flaunting a confident edge and exuding an extrovert's ability to
take over a party. Just 48 hours later, without breaking his bold
stride, Houston took over the Atlanta Hawks' home and made himself
comfortable as he delivered a playoff career-high 34 points to give
the Knicks Game 1 of their four-of-seven-game second-round series,
a 100-92 victory on Tuesday night at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get paid to shoot, make or miss,'' said Houston, who was 13
of 20 from the floor. ``Over all, as far as confidence, if people
want to consider the Miami shot the one that propelled me, that's
fine. But I want to think of it as one of many more to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his 10-foot jumper in Miami was a defining shot for
Houston, one that set his confidence up for a night like Tuesday
night. His assertiveness was contagious as the team formed a line
behind him and followed.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of overindulging on their victory in Miami, the Knicks
came out crisp and sharp at the beginning. There was no letdown, as
Coach Jeff Van Gundy had feared. There was no sign of a team that
seemed uninterested in the Hawks or less energetic in the face of
an opponent they did not loathe as much as they did the Heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was worried, too,'' Chris Childs said. ``When we got out
there, I was shocked at how ready we were. I didn't know if we'd
have the same attitude we had when we played in Miami. But we
did.''
</P>
<P>
   They had that aggressive air about them even with the gallant
Patrick Ewing in foul trouble most of the night. Without him for
all but 17 minutes in the game, Houston and his running partner,
Latrell Sprewell, filled the offensive void.
</P>
<P>
   The two of them set out on a torrid transition game that defied
the plodding, halfcourt style that seemed inevitable when the
matchup between these two defensive-minded teams developed.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of walking the ball up the floor and allowing the aging
and worn Hawks to take a breath and set up their defense, the
Knicks seized any missed shot and pushed the ball up the floor. It
was a situation made for Sprewell in the first half, when he scored
17 of playoff career-high 31 points. In the third quarter, it was
Houston's turn. Delivering smooth, silky jumpers and also darting
to the hoop, he collected 15 points and helped turn an 8-point
deficit into an 80-73 Knick lead entering the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``To attack before their defense is set, you have to get stops
and rebound,'' said Van Gundy, whose team outrebounded the Hawks,
40-32. ``And rebounding has been the hardest part against them.''
</P>
<P>
   The ominous Dikembe Mutombo has had a lot to do with that. But
when Ewing was on the floor, he was able to pull Mutombo away from
the basket with an uncanny baseline jumper. When Ewing, who made 6
of 7 shots, kept collecting fouls, there was Chris Dudley. He
didn't have the offense to draw Mutombo, but he had fouls to give
and a brawny body to put in front of the elbow-throwing
shot-blocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dudley gave us great minutes,'' said Van Gundy, who didn't
play Dudley in Game 5 against Miami. ``He hadn't been playing, but
to his credit, he kept himself ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing kept himself in the right frame of mind as well. He had
been exasperated all night, and even picked up a technical foul
with 11 minutes 25 seconds left in the third quarter, popping off
when he picked up his fifth foul. But upon his return, Ewing
rediscovered his touch.
</P>
<P>
   For a brief moment, the Knicks eased their foot off the pedal.
After the Knicks built a gaudy 17-point lead with 6:53 left in the
game on a massive two-handed dunk by Sprewell, the Hawks went on a
12-4 run to cut the Knicks' lead to 7 points with 1:59 left. That
was when Ewing, who loped back onto the floor just two minutes
earlier, came up with a 10-foot jumper to spell some relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating sitting,'' said Ewing, whose injury-riddled
body probably benefited from his 17 minutes of playing time, during
which he scored 12 points. ``I'm just happy we got the win. If I
knew I wasn't going to play, I would have sat out.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the night, Ewing had a good seat for Houston's
performance. Houston worked in tandem with Sprewell, whose
explosive night offensively was tempered only by the shaky defense
he played. Just after Sprewell had scored 9 points in the first
quarter to send the Knicks to a 38-27 lead in the second quarter,
he inexplicably left the mild-mannered Chris Crawford open for two
straight 3-pointers. Crawford, who scored a team-high 26 points,
had 17 in the second quarter to give the Hawks a 50-48 halftime
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks had made up this ground without Steve Smith, who
scored 25 points, but was saddled with foul trouble through the
game. Smith has been an irritant to the Knicks and has often got
the best of Houston. This time was different. This time, Smith was
facing a player who burst out of his shell in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you hit a shot like he did, your confidence
skyrockets,'' Childs said. `'I've told him, he's the future here.''
</P>
<P>
   He played like it. He played as if the Miami shot had been a
turning point for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may be a stretch,'' Van Gundy said. ``But let's stay with
that if he can come out and give us 34 every night. I do know this:
He's always been confident. Obviously, making a shot like he did
just expands that confidence.''

EDITORIAL: BAD DECISION ON CLEAN AIR 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, May 19:
</P>
<P>
   In a bizarre and tortured decision, a three-judge federal
appeals panel last week invalidated air-quality regulations imposed
by the Clinton administration to ease the suffering of millions of
Americans with asthma and lung disease. If upheld, the decision
would repudiate one of the administration's main environmental
achievements and award victory to a coalition of industries and
state governments that have fought the regulations in Congress and
in the courts. It could threaten a series of other clean-air
initiatives as well, and overturn a half-century of jurisprudence
that has allowed Congress to delegate important rule-making powers
to federal agencies. For all these reasons, the administration is
obliged to appeal this decision _ first to the full Court of
Appeals, and, if that fails, to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   At issue were two administrative rulings by the Environmental
Protection Agency in 1997. One tightened the standards for
ground-level ozone, a major contributor to smog. The other set new
limits on microscopic dust-like specks called particulates.
</P>
<P>
   The rulings were controversial. Though they would clearly bring
health benefits, they would also force many industrialized states
to find new ways to reduce pollution. That in turn would mean big
investments in cleaner power plants, fuels and cars. This page
supported the rulings, as did the governors of New York, New Jersey
and other Northeastern states that suffer from dirty air
``imported'' from coal-fired plants in the Midwest. But they were
bitterly opposed by several Midwestern state governments, many big
utilities and industry.
</P>
<P>
   The two judges who voted to overturn the rulings were Stephen F.
Williams and Donald H. Ginsburg, both Reagan appointees. David S.
Tatel, a Clinton appointee, dissented. In explaining their
decision, the majority dusted off the ``nondelegation doctrine,''
which says that Congress cannot delegate legislative-like powers to
the executive branch. The doctrine was twice upheld in the 1930s.
Since then the Supreme Court has shown no appetite for reviving it,
and has consistently upheld delegations of power from Congress to
agencies like the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from its shaky constitutional underpinnings, the decision
was confusing as to which branch of government had in fact violated
the nondelegation doctrine. Some parts of the opinion blamed
Congress for writing a vague clean-air law and giving away too much
authority. Other parts blamed the EPA for exceeding its authority
and imposing ``arbitrary'' standards. Either way, there are
problems. To tell Congress that it can no longer broadly delegate
authority is to say that Congress must henceforth write detailed
regulations _ an executive function it does not want and cannot
effectively perform. To fault the EPA is to say that it cannot make
the choices it must make to institute broad congressional mandates.
</P>
<P>
   To some people, especially opponents, agency choices will always
seem ``arbitrary.'' But as Tatel noted, that does not mean the new
standards for soot and ozone were arbitrarily arrived at. On the
contrary, he noted, the EPA had ``adhered to a disciplined
decisionmaking process,'' including four years of scientific and
medical studies and extensive peer review. In addition, the agency
gave the states up to 15 years to meet these standards.
</P>
<P>
   The court has now sent the rulings back to the EPA for review
and, presumably, revision. But the question that leaps to mind is
whether any new standards will satisfy Judge Williams and Judge
Ginsburg. The administration's obvious course is to challenge their
decision.

EDITORIAL: A PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY FOR MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Timees said in an editorial on Wednesday, May 19:
</P>
<P>
   Mexico was already headed toward a lively three-party
presidential contest next year. Now the contest will begin even
earlier, with this week's welcome decision by the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, to choose its nominee through a
national primary election open to all voters.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the PRI reflected the undemocratic circumstances
of its birth some 70 years ago. The victorious veterans of Mexico's
revolution organized the party as an instrument for keeping power
in their own hands, and those of their chosen political heirs,
indefinitely. The PRI has controlled Mexico's presidency and most
other high offices ever since. In the past, its presidential
nominees were hand-picked by the outgoing president. That helped
turn Mexico's political leadership into a closed, self-perpetuating
club.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to a broad-based national primary will contribute to a
healthy opening of Mexican political life. It may also help
reinvigorate a party that has grown complacent and out of touch
with the modern Mexican electorate.
</P>
<P>
   The new primary system will allow prospective PRI nominees to
sharpen their appeal to voters. Victory will go to the contender
who wins the largest number of electoral districts, a rule designed
to encourage campaigning outside urban centers like Mexico City.
Candidates will have to resign any government offices, participate
in debates and abide by campaign spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   Credit for the new system goes mainly to President Ernesto
Zedillo, who pressed ahead with changes far bolder and more
resistant to high-level tampering than most Mexican analysts
expected. Having earlier pushed through legislation to assure
fairer campaigning and impartial election supervision, Zedillo is
well on his way to building a legacy as the president who brought
real democracy to Mexico after decades of manipulated candidacies
and fraudulent elections. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES:personnel and employee relations.
</P>
<P>
   Broadhurst said the Police Department also is investigating
claims of similar incidents in Los Angeles public libraries, where
Smith has been employed intermittently since 1990 _ although city
officials said he has not worked for the city in a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's confronted about these bizarre behaviors, he claims
to have had a seizure, which is identical to what occurred at El
Sereno,'' Broadhurst said. ``That's why people were calling me even
before the name was published.''
</P>
<P>
   The LAUSD is experiencing a shortage of teachers and is
struggling to fill thousands of vacant positions, and last week's
incident was the latest symptom of the teacher crunch, said school
board member David Tokofsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we are short thousands of teachers and hundreds of
substitutes,'' Tokofsky said. ``Issues of selectivity are not high
on L.A. Unified's radar screen when we're in that deep of a
shortage.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to fingerprinting, the LAUSD background check
includes a written agreement requiring disclosure of any criminal
convictions or pending court cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if individuals do not have convictions, then it becomes
rather difficult to deny them their credentials,'' said Santiago
Jackson, assistant superintendent of the district's Office of
Legislation.
</P>
<P>
   School officials said there are no immediate plans to seek
expansion of their access to employees' background information.
</P>
<P>
   ``From where we sit as a school district, we'd like to have all
of the information and pursue all of the information, but with
everything in place right now as far as privacy laws, employee
records, it is hard to get information unless there has been a
conviction of an individual,'' Jackson said.

EDITORIAL: THE FED EDGES TOWARD ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, May 19:
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve's decision on Tuesday to leave interest
rates unchanged but to warn that it was thinking of raising them in
the future reaffirms how unsure the policy makers are about the
state of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed cut rates three times late last year when it believed
that the financial panic following the Russian default would slow
American growth and might bring on a world recession. In retrospect
the Fed seems to have overreacted, although the cuts appeared
prudent at the time. Now, with the United States' economy growing
far more rapidly than expected, a world recession seemingly
unlikely and with some signs of a rebirth of inflation, a modest
increase in rates could easily be justified.
</P>
<P>
   That the Fed did not dictate such an increase, but instead
announced a ``bias'' in favor of raising rates in the future,
probably reflects a continued argument within the Fed's open market
committee about the extent to which inflation is a threat. Some
believe that thanks to increases in productivity brought on by
computers, the economy is now able to grow much faster than in the
past without any appreciable threat of inflation. But it is also
possible that inflation has been held down by overseas weakness
that is now reversing. The Fed should be vigilant about inflation,
and may rightly conclude next month that a rate increase is wise.

TEACHER'S ARREST SHOWS HIRING FLAWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A substitute teacher accused of taking off his
pants in front of fourth-graders last week had a history of alleged
sexual battery or harassment against co-workers at area libraries,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   And even after the incident at El Sereno Elementary School,
teacher Wendell Smith got a job substituting the next day at a
second Los Angeles school, Yorkdale Elementary School in Eagle
Rock, when rules were bypassed, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not go through the substitute office when they hired
him,'' said Los Angeles Unified School District spokesman Pat
Spencer, adding that a memo is being sent to all principals
reminding them of proper substitute hiring procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 46, was arrested Thursday at his Highland Park home. He
has pleaded not guilty to four counts of forcible lewd acts with a
child and was being held on $750,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's case is not unique.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a former deputy state labor commissioner without
teaching credentials was hired to work at a Los Angeles elementary
school even though he was under federal investigation and
eventually indicted on suspicion of collecting more than $60,000 in
bribes in his previous post.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases and others, officials said the privacy rights of
prospective employees collided with the need to provide for the
safety of children _ and that safety lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a parent, my gut instinct is to say always err on the side
of caution to protect children,'' said Kathleen Dixon, a San Pedro
attorney who serves as chairwoman of the LAUSD Parent
Collaborative. ``But as an attorney, I know how badly that can be
abused.''
</P>
<P>
   Eadie Gieb of Sylmar, president of Parents and Students United
of the San Fernando Valley, took a less compromising view and
suggested making release of full employment records a condition of
working as a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We entrust our children to go to school, and we believe that
somehow they're going to be safe there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that there are some sexual predators out there
that need to be weeded out of the system, and they threaten all
children's safety.''
</P>
<P>
   LAUSD officials said they have little access to negative
information unless a person is convicted of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   In the Smith case, incidents at libraries in Glendale, Inglewood
and Los Angeles where he worked part time did not lead to criminal
prosecution or convictions and were never reported to the school
district, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had we known of any of this, he would not have been hired,''
said LAUSD spokesman Brad Sales. ``We have a reference on file from
Inglewood that doesn't mention any of this. It said everything was
hunky-dory.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials for the cities of Inglewood, Glendale and Los Angeles
said that because of recent lawsuits, records of employee
misconduct remain confidential _ inaccessible to even other
prospective employers.
</P>
<P>
   The school district conducts background checks of job
applicants, including a fingerprint check, but state law allows
access to information about criminal convictions only _ not
arrests, Sales said.
</P>
<P>
   Arrests that occur after an employee is hired would be reported
to the school district only if the employee reveals to the
arresting agency that he or she works for a school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a concern to the parents, and it's a concern to us
also,'' said LAPD Inspector Detective Larry Broadhurst, who is
supervising the investigation of Smith. ``Maybe there's a flaw in
the system that needs to be looked at.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Smith, of Highland Park, had worked as a
substitute teacher for the LAUSD for two years with no incidents
until last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On April 27, 1998, the Inglewood Police Department filed a
sexual battery report against Smith after a co-worker at Inglewood
Public Library complained that he entered her office, suddenly
reached down, grabbed her hand and placed it on his groin. The city
attorney did not prosecute.
</P>
<P>
   Inglewood Library Director Miguel Alaniz said he knew that Smith
worked for the LAUSD but officials would not say whether anyone
notified the school district of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our policy is we don't volunteer information without a
release,'' said Inglewood Personnel Director Robert Wilson. A
release is a statement signed by the individual, authorizing
disclosure of information.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1998, Smith began working as an intermittent librarian
at the Glendale Public Library but was fired just six months later
in February 1999 as the result of a sexual harassment complaint by
a female librarian, said Jack Hoffman, director of personnel and
employee relations.

HOTLINE HELPS PARENTS MONITOR TEEN DRIVERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JESSE HIESTAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Do you know how your teen-ager is driving?
</P>
<P>
   Now if teen drivers misbehave on the road, there's a way to find
out. An emergency room nurse, tired of treating child car-crash
victims, has set up a hotline to report bad drivers whose cars have
``1 (888)-TELL DAD'' bumper stickers.
</P>
<P>
   The service costs $14.95 for the bumper sticker and $5 per month
for monitoring, including notification of parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times you can have a really good kid, and when
they're with their friends they get a little reckless, careless, a
little daring,'' said Wendy Petta, 26. ``This will make them think:
Oh, yeah, I have a sticker on my bumper.''
</P>
<P>
   Petta recently began distributing the stickers. Each carries a
large-print identification number so motorists can lodge a specific
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   So far she has four customers, including Lisette Perez, who made
her 19-year-old daughter put it on the bumper of her Honda Civic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will give me a little more peace of mind to know someone is
keeping an eye on her and she's not driving recklessly,'' said
Perez, 40, who said she has reported truck drivers for bad driving.
``It's just one more deterrent.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristell Perez said she had little choice but to accept the
sticker because she is still living at home and the car is in her
parents' name.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said as long as I keep having the sticker on, I can take
the car wherever I want to go,'' she said. ``I have a feeling that
if they do get called, I'd probably get my car taken away.''
</P>
<P>
   Police welcome the idea but question how effective it will be
for kids who might remove the sticker or who face little prospect
of being punished if they are caught.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, how are you going to get the kids to keep it on
their car?'' said Officer Dwight McDonald of the California Highway
Patrol's West Valley station. He said the one who doesn't mind
having the sticker on the car is probably the one more likely to
obey traffic laws, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald said the CHP regularly receives complaints about bad
driving and, using the license plate as an identifier, follows up
with a letter warning that the alleged violator's actions were
observed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get enough complaints, we take it to the city
attorney,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Petta said she started the business out of her home after a
close call with a teen-age driver on Angeles Crest Highway about
two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was coming home from my mom's with my two kids in the car,
and this young kid came by in his Mustang and cut me off, and I had
to swerve,'' she said. ``I thought: I wish his mom knew how he was
driving because if she did he wouldn't be driving like that.''
</P>
<P>
   As an emergency room nurse at Verdugo Hills Hospital north of
Los Angeles, Petta said she often sees the injuries that teen-agers
and others suffer in traffic crashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they know their parents are going to find out about
reckless driving, they're going to drive safer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When phoning in a complaint to her service, a person should give
the identification number on the bumper sticker and the time, date
and location of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Petta said she will then call the parents and relay the
information.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen-year-old Melissa La Joice said she is glad to drive the
family Dodge Caravan when she is allowed, although it carries one
of the bumper stickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a burden,'' said Melissa, who has a
learner's permit. ``It's a protective measure. If someone has that
on, they'll have that responsibility on their shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Jan La Joice, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard some people say, oh, it's Big Brother watching, but
I don't think that's what it was intended for,'' she said. ``It's
more of a reminder that you need to be aware and need to be safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Jan La Joice also drives the Caravan, she knows she must
live up to the standard she expects of her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could just as easily report me as my daughter,'' she
said. ``So the parents have to set an example.''

EDITORIAL: BEFORE THE BEGINNING, AFTER THE END 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Most viewers will recall the chronological discontinuity at the
beginning of the first ``Star Wars'' film, which appeared in 1977.
In the opening text that scrolled up the screen, ushering audiences
into the unknown, there were two puzzles. ``Star Wars,'' subtitled
``A New Hope,'' was a science-fiction movie set in the remote past,
and it was also called ``Episode IV.'' The old Horatian advice to
poets is to begin ``in medias res,'' in the middle of things. That
adage still applies, but for a different reason than Horace had in
mind. If you call the first ``Star Wars'' film ``Episode IV,'' you
enclose the audience, as Horace understood, in an already onrushing
vehicle. But if your story is as entertaining as ``Star Wars'' was,
you also build demand for the missing episodes, for what is now
called the prequel, a word unknown until the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   So far, George Lucas' new film, ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The
Phantom Menace,'' which opens today, has been prequel only to
itself. The soundtrack was released early, and so was the
novelization. ``Phantom Menace'' merchandise went on sale
nationwide two weeks ago. Hype is too small a word for the sales
pressure that has been building up behind this movie, which is only
appropriate, since the original ``Star Wars'' trilogy set a
precedent not only in the use of special effects and the fervor the
films inspired among fans but also in the development of retail
licensing. All in all, it seems a little disingenuous for Fox,
which is releasing the movie, to complain about reviews that jumped
the release date. If they had been glowing, perhaps Fox executives
would never have complained. As it is, advance reviews suggest that
there are few harder tasks than making a really good prequel.
</P>
<P>
   The business of America is business, said a man not half as wise
as Obi-Wan Kenobi. But the entertainment of America is also
business, which, as George Lucas has proved many times over, can be
entertaining in itself. Whatever the final verdict on ``The Phantom
Menace,'' yea or nay, Lucas will go down in cinematic history as
the greatest director of licensed properties yet, a brilliant
commodifier of the movies. It would have been hard enough for ``The
Phantom Menace'' to compete with the original ``Star Wars''
trilogy. To compete with what is expected of it may prove nearly
impossible.

 THE ASTROBIOLOGY INSTITUTE: NASA'S METAPHYSICAL MISSION  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. _ Nobel prize-winning biochemist Baruch S.
Blumberg has been named to head NASA's new Astrobiology Institute,
a bold project to seek evidence for the origin and evolution of
life in the universe, space agency administrator Daniel S. Goldin
announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at eleven major universities and research centers are
already linked together and collaborating by computer to form the
``virtual'' institute, with its headquarters at the Ames Research
Center in Mountain View.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin made the announcement of Blumberg's appointment during a
talk to the Ames staff that clearly displayed his own excitement
over the institute's future. Among the extraordinary scientific
advances envisioned by the NASA chief are:
</P>
<P>
   _Intelligent DNA-based computer chips and ``biologically
inspired electronics'' aboard miniature space vehicles may seek
signs of life among comet clouds beyond the solar system, he
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   _Submarines may one day probe the frigid oceans that most
probably underlie the cracked and icy crust of Jupiter's moon
Europa.
</P>
<P>
   _``Simulation chambers'' will exploit new knowledge of
Earth-bound microorganisms living in extreme environments to model
the earliest life on Earth and beneath the Martian surface _ and
even predict entire ecosystems of planets around distant stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new field of study,'' Goldin said, ``will bring a new
understanding of fundamental life processes on Earth and throughout
our universe, if it exists.'' But it will demand a ``revolution in
communications, networking, information technology, computing and
scientific thinking,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has asked Congress to increase the institute's annual
budget from $10 million to $25 million, and Goldin projected that
the institute would eventually need $100 million a year to achieve
its goals.
</P>
<P>
   To Goldin, astrobiology involves ventures ``so vast and with
goals so staggering'' that it may well enable science to ``capture
and develop the universal fingerprints of life processes.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching those goals, he said, will involve finding answers to
such questions as: How does life begin and evolve? Does life exist
elsewhere in the universe? And what is the possibility of life on
Earth and beyond?
</P>
<P>
   There may be more than a touch of metaphysics in such questions,
but scientists around the world have long been trying to answer
them. America's own National Science Foundation, as well as NASA,
is already financing major research into the first two mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   A new Exobiology Institute, Goldin said, will try to create
artificial cells that mimic the metabolic processes of living
organisms ``and search for the complex chain of interactions that
may determine how life originates and evolves.''
</P>
<P>
   And if submarines do probe Europa's ocean on missions inspired
by the Astrobiology Institute, they could carry newly conceived
machines to ``discover, analyze and automatically sequence the
genome of any microbes found there,'' Goldin said. ``Just imagine
how finding even single-cell life forms on other planets may add to
our understanding of the biodiversity of our universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumberg, the Institute's new director, is both a physician and
biochemist. He won his Nobel laurels in 1976 for isolating the
unique protein that led to a vaccine against hepatitis B, a liver
disease that once afflicted more than 200 million people worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   A cancer specialist and frequent visiting professor of biology
at Stanford, Blumberg has been a research chief at the Fox Chase
Cancer Center in Philadelphia and is a professor of medicine and
anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the Ames Research Center staff yesterday, Blumberg
said the Institute will ``answer some of the most fundamental
questions of biology, unencumbered by previous hypotheses.''
Scientists at all the Institute's component centers will focus
their energies on ``curiosity-driven research'' rather than
specific space missions, he said, which will mean ``a whole new
universe is opening before us.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Goldin and Blumberg stressed that they cannot begin to
predict what life may be like and how it originated elsewhere in
the universe. When a reporter asked Blumberg, ``How do you look for
something if you don't even know what it is,'' he replied _ to
appreciative laughter from the scientists in his audience _
``That's just what basic research is all about.''

EX-COUNCILMAN WINS PHILADELPHIA PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ A long and often nasty Democratic primary
campaign ended Tuesday when John F. Street, the former City Council
president and Mayor Edward G. Rendell's chosen successor, defeated
five other candidates to win the party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Street will oppose Sam Katz, a financial consultant
who is seeking to become the city's first Republican elected mayor
since 1947. Katz, who lost a mayoral primary bid in 1991 and a 1994
bid to become Pennsylvania governor, faced no opposition in
Tuesday's Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell, a Democrat who is is barred by law from seeking a third
four-year term, has been credited with revitalizing Philadelphia's
finances and spirit. His strong support and early endorsement of
Street, along with that of the city's three main newspapers, helped
Street keep atop of most polls.
</P>
<P>
   With 97 percent of the ballots counted, Street had 100,308
votes, or 35 percent, to defeat Marty Weinberg, a former high-level
aide to the late Mayor Frank Rizzo. Weinberg had 88,297 votes, or
31 percent, better than expected.
</P>
<P>
   While the campaign began with thoughtful discourses on issues
like crime, education and economic development it became dominated
by attack advertising as the candidates spent record amounts, more
than $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg, who is white, made no secret of the fact he was
counting heavily upon a high turnout among white voters, especially
those from the working-class and middle-class neighborhoods where
Rizzo enjoyed widespread support during his divisive tenure as
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of advertisements, Weinberg showed 18-year-old film
footage of Street, who is black, as a young, boisterous member of
the City Council, shoving a television reporter in one instance and
throwing water in someone's face in another.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg also ran advertisements that cited Street's history of
personal financial problems, including two bankruptcy filings, as a
way to raise questions about his ability to manage the city
government.
</P>
<P>
   Street, who served seven years as council president through last
December, vowed throughout his campaign to continue the progress of
the Rendell administration and avoided the mud slinging.
</P>
<P>
   But he was finally drawn in last week, running commercials that
condemned Weinberg for injecting race as an issue. The Street
advertisements quoted newspaper endorsements of Street that chided
Weinberg for exploiting racial tensions.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, it was probably Street's working partnership
with Rendell that cemented victory. Over the years, they worked
closely to turn around Philadelphia's financial status, from near
bankrupt in 1992 to robust in more recent times. In particular, the
downtown area has enjoyed a surge in economic development as
Philadelphia enhances its attractiveness to tourists.
</P>
<P>
   In the rest of the primary field, John F. White Jr., the city's
former public housing director, received 22 percent of the vote,
followed by Happy Fernandez, a former member of the City Council;
Dwight Evans, a state legislator for the last 18 years, Queena R.
Bass.
</P>
<P>
   While Street will undoubtedly be considered the front-runner in
the fall campaign, owing in large measure to the greater number of
registered Democrats over Republicans, about 7 to 2, in the city,
Katz has an unusually large pool of Democrats to approach _ the
majority of those who voted Tuesday for candidates other than

THE ASTROBIOLOGY INSTITUTE: NASA'S METAPHYSICAL MISSION
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. _ Nobel prize-winning biochemist Baruch
S. Blumberg has been named to head NASA's new Astrobiology
Institute, a bold project to seek evidence for the origin and
evolution of life in the universe, space agency administrator
Daniel S. Goldin announced Tuesday.
<P>
   Scientists at eleven major universities and research centers are
already linked together and collaborating by computer to form the
``virtual'' institute, with its headquarters at the Ames Research
Center in Mountain View.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin made the announcement of Blumberg's appointment during a
talk to the Ames staff that clearly displayed his own excitement
over the institute's future. Among the extraordinary scientific
advances envisioned by the NASA chief are:
</P>
<P>
   -- Intelligent DNA-based computer chips and ``biologically
inspired electronics'' aboard miniature space vehicles may seek
signs of life among comet clouds beyond the solar system, he
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   -- Submarines may one day probe the frigid oceans that most
probably underlie the cracked and icy crust of Jupiter's moon
Europa.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Simulation chambers'' will exploit new knowledge of
Earth-bound microorganisms living in extreme environments to model
the earliest life on Earth and beneath the Martian surface _ and
even predict entire ecosystems of planets around distant stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new field of study,'' Goldin said, ``will bring a new
understanding of fundamental life processes on Earth and throughout
our universe, if it exists.'' But it will demand a ``revolution in
communications, networking, information technology, computing and
scientific thinking,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has asked Congress to increase the institute's annual
budget from $10 million to $25 million, and Goldin projected that
the institute would eventually need $100 million a year to achieve
its goals.
</P>
<P>
   To Goldin, astrobiology involves ventures ``so vast and with
goals so staggering'' that it may well enable science to ``capture
and develop the universal fingerprints of life processes.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching those goals, he said, will involve finding answers to
such questions as: How does life begin and evolve? Does life exist
elsewhere in the universe? And what is the possibility of life on
Earth and beyond?
</P>
<P>
   There may be more than a touch of metaphysics in such questions,
but scientists around the world have long been trying to answer
them. America's own National Science Foundation, as well as NASA,
is already financing major research into the first two mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   A new Exobiology Institute, Goldin said, will try to create
artificial cells that mimic the metabolic processes of living
organisms ``and search for the complex chain of interactions that
may determine how life originates and evolves.''
</P>
<P>
   And if submarines do probe Europa's ocean on missions inspired
by the Astrobiology Institute, they could carry newly conceived
machines to ``discover, analyze and automatically sequence the
genome of any microbes found there,'' Goldin said. ``Just imagine
how finding even single-cell life forms on other planets may add to
our understanding of the biodiversity of our universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumberg, the Institute's new director, is both a physician and
biochemist. He won his Nobel laurels in 1976 for isolating the
unique protein that led to a vaccine against hepatitis B, a liver
disease that once afflicted more than 200 million people worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   A cancer specialist and frequent visiting professor of biology
at Stanford, Blumberg has been a research chief at the Fox Chase
Cancer Center in Philadelphia and is a professor of medicine and
anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the Ames Research Center staff Tuesday, Blumberg
said the Institute will ``answer some of the most fundamental
questions of biology, unencumbered by previous hypotheses.''
Scientists at all the Institute's component centers will focus
their energies on ``curiosity-driven research'' rather than
specific space missions, he said, which will mean ``a whole new
universe is opening before us.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Goldin and Blumberg stressed that they cannot begin to
predict what life may be like and how it originated elsewhere in
the universe. When a reporter asked Blumberg, ``How do you look for
something if you don't even know what it is?'' he replied _ to
appreciative laughter from the scientists in his audience _
``That's just what basic research is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, SGI Inc., a major Silicon Valley
computer company, signed an agreement with NASA Tuesday to develop
specialized supercomputers for the space agency's new Astrobiology
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with the $2.7 billion Mountain View company _
formerly called Silicon Graphics _ is aimed at speeding the
application of ``high performance'' computer power to solve
problems in biology, astrophysics and chemistry, said SGI sales
director Ross MacPhee. No dollar amount for the collaborative
effort has been set, MacPhee said.
</P>
<P>
   NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin, who signed the agreement
with SGI, said the space agency's renewed quest to understand how
life originated and evolved on Earth and perhaps elsewhere in the
universe will require new generations of powerful computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a revolution in communications, networking,
information technology, computing and scientific thinking,'' Goldin
told the staff at the Ames Research Center in Mountain View
Tuesday. SGI computer scientists will apparently work to foment
that revolution under its memorandum of understanding with NASA.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is the first in what Goldin promised would be an
ongoing commitment by the Astrobiology Institute to collaborate
with private industry in a wide range of research efforts _
particularly those that call for advanced equipment for analyzing
life forms and simulating what new and unknown forms of life might
be.

DODGERS ROUTED BY ASTROS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Dodgers left-hander Carlos Perez
lasted 31/3 innings against the Houston Astros, which is indicative
of the state of the supposed strength of the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   On nights Kevin Brown isn't on the mound, the Dodgers' starters
aren't pitching very well or deep into games. Starters not named
Brown haven't thrown a pitch in the eighth inning this month.
</P>
<P>
   Only Chan Ho Park finished the seventh inning, which he's done
twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you asked me (in March), in the middle of May what would I
be worried about, and you said the starting pitching not giving me
enough innings, I'd say you were crazy,'' Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said before L.A. lost to Houston 11-3 Tuesday night at
Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' offense _ little as it was _ came courtesy of Raul
Mondesi, who hit his 14th homer of the season, a three-run shot in
the sixth. Mondesi was matched by Houston first baseman Jeff
Bagwell, who hit his 11th homer, went 3 for 4 and had three RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of starting pitching on Johnson's spring training
checklist was the bullpen, the second slot in the batting order,
the health of catcher Todd Hundley's elbow, some golf in Vero
Beach, maybe some fishing, how the Dodgers would perform during the
equinox...
</P>
<P>
   With Brown, Park, Ismael Valdes, Perez and Darren Dreifort in
the rotation _ not to mention Dave Mlicki as an insurance policy _
getting innings out of the starters wasn't a concern.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is the only starter with an ERA under three at 2.75.
Valdes (4-1, 3.40) is off to his best start but blisters have
limited his innings.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dreifort (4.61), Perez (6.63) and Park (5.32) have
all been hit hard lately. Other than Brown, the Dodgers' starters
have averaged less than six innings per outing. In turn, it hasn't
allowed Johnson to set his bullpen up to utilize Alan Mills as a
bridge between the starter and closer Jeff Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, Perez has been the biggest disappointment, a
trend that continued against the National League Central leading
Astros. They entered the night feasting on left-handed pitching,
hitting .362 against southpaws, and they devoured Perez.
</P>
<P>
   It took them an inning to get their timing on Perez, who was
chased before the fifth inning for the second time in six starts.
Perez lasted 41/3 innings in another start.
</P>
<P>
   Perez (1-5) gave up six runs (four earned) on five hits and the
Dodgers trailed 6-0 before they had three hits off Houston starter
Jose Lima (7-1).
</P>
<P>
   The Astros took a 1-0 lead in the second inning when Lima
singled to score Russ Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Houston then hit Perez hard in the third inning. Bagwell began
the three-run inning with a one-out solo homer to left field, his
15th hit in 35 at-bats (.429) against lefties. Three batters later
catcher Tony Eusebio hit a two-run homer as Houston went ahead 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   It was Eusebio's first homer of the season, a 435-foot blast
into the bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros added two runs in the fourth, helped along by third
baseman Adrian Beltre's fielding error on Tim Bogar's grounder.
After a walk to Craig Biggio, Johnson lifted Perez in favor of
Dreifort.
</P>
<P>
   Before Johnson reached the mound Perez was off it. He flipped
the ball to Johnson, headed to the dugout to grab his jacket and
walked straight up the tunnel. Dreifort then yielded a two-run
double to Bagwell as the Astros increased their lead to 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi drew the Dodgers within 6-3, but the Astros peppered
right-handed reliever Jamie Arnold for five more runs in the eighth
inning. Pinch-hitter Bill Spiers had a two-run double and Derek
Bell drove in two runs with a single.
</P>
<P>
   The only good news for the Dodgers?
</P>
<P>
   Brown pitches today.

 HERB MIXTURE AS PROSTATE CANCER TREATMENT PRAISED  &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A traditional blend of eight Chinese herbs is starting to show
promise as a treatment for advanced prostate cancer, researchers
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The herbal concoction, called ``PC-SPES'' and sold in health
food stores as a dietary supplement, achieved results by one
measure even in men who had failed conventional hormonal therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows how the mixture might work, which of the eight
ingredients may be the most beneficial or harmful, and whether side
effects will prove acceptable after long-term use.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors warned cancer patients that supplements fall outside the
standard regulatory system for drugs and may vary in purity and
potency. And while early studies often seem promising, further
research could lead to different conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the caveats, cancer specialists said they are intrigued
by the potential benefits of PC-SPES, which derives its English
name from the abbreviation for ``prostate cancer'' and the Latin
word for ``hope.''
</P>
<P>
   The mixture includes saw palmetto, a supplement used by some men
to achieve shrinkage of an enlarged prostate. Other ingredients
include indigotica (da qing ye), glycyrrhiza glabra and glycyrrhiza
(gan cao), Panax Pseudo Ginseng (san qi) and Ganoderma Iucidum
Karst (ling zhi). Only one company makes it, a Southern California
firm that based the mix on a traditional Chinese recipe. It costs
$200 to $400 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary results of an ongoing two-year study of PC-SPES were
reported at a meeting of cancer specialists in Atlanta Tuesday.
Authors included Dr. Eric Small and colleagues at the University of
California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The study is one of the first to subject the herbal compound to
rigorous clinical testing. Results reported Tuesday involved 61
men, out of a total of 70 enrolled in the clinical study, including
34 patients whose cancer was no longer responding to hormonal
therapy and 27 men who had not been treated with hormones.
</P>
<P>
   All the men received a standard dose of nine capsules daily of
PC-SPES. Researchers then measured circulating levels of prostate
specific antigen (PSA), a blood marker commonly used to track
cancer patients although by no means a perfect indicator of
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Reductions of PSA levels exceeding 50 percent were observed in
all 27 ``hormone-naive'' patients. But experts were most impressed
by Small's report that PSA levels also plummeted in 19 of the 34
hormone-resistant patients.
</P>
<P>
   That suggests PC-SPES may have effects that go beyond simply
reducing male hormones that act on the prostate. There were also
hints of tumor shrinkage in some men, though details were not yet
available.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's clearly showing an effect,'' said Dr. Robert DiPaola at
the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick, N.J. ``But
to really know its usefulness, we need to do further studies.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Wu, a researcher at New York Medical College in Valhalla,
N.Y., also emphasized the need for caution when interpreting the
limited study results.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the fundamental idea behind PC-SPES _ throwing
multiple weapons against a disease _ makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cocktails work much better than single agents alone,`` Wu
said, noting the recent experience in using multiple drug
combinations to fight HIV.

IN REAL LIFE, THE MOVIE WAS BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ Razzing the nerds, that wasn't invented at
Columbine High School, and it's not new.
<P>
   We all knew a Ronnie Gebron. Or we were him.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Jackson, local business and political figure, is a
compassionate champion of the underdog. It's his life. But recently
Arthur has been haunted by the memory of a kid from his high
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronnie Gebron,'' Jackson says. ``He was fat, had red hair and
freckles and wore glasses. That's the grand slam of nerdiness,
isn't it? We were never kind to him in four years. He must have
been angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur was a high school jock, a soccer star. The scariest thing
he and his pals could imagine was to be seen being nice to a Ronnie
Gebron. And sweet Jesus, what if Ronnie somehow showed up at a
party?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why was I like that?'' Jackson says. ``I wasn't brought up
that way. And it was a Quaker school. But they never once told us,
`You've got to be nice.' We have to teach that.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Billy Madison,'' a '95 Adam Sandler movie, Billy (Adam) has
a similar delayed attack of conscience. Billy remembers the nerd he
tormented in high school. He phones the nerd and sincerely
apologizes.
</P>
<P>
   The nerd, still nerdy, is taken aback but graciously accepts the
apology. He hangs up, reaches over to a long list of names taped to
his wall, labeled ``People to kill,'' and crosses off Billy
Madison.
</P>
<P>
   It was funnier before Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   BULLY.COM: The online book behemoths are trying to crush your
local bookstore by slashing prices on best-sellers. But what about
the speed of delivery?
</P>
<P>
   History buff Jerry Matters ordered a book on the Berlin airlift
from Amazon.com. He placed the order on Christmas day of '97. The
book arrived Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry says, ``I hope they stay out of the mail-order-bride
business.''
</P>
<P>
   WWWWW...: We're lucky that when Tim Berners-Lee invented the
World Wide Web he didn't name it the Wondrous World Wide Web Window
to the Whole Wide Weird Wacky World. But even at a mere three Ws,
it's a lot to say.
</P>
<P>
   Why not fix it? The WWW is supposed to make our lives more
efficient, so why such a ponderous mouthful o' wordage? Why not say
``dub'' instead of dubbaya-dubbaya-dubbaya? Save eight syllables
every time.
</P>
<P>
   MANNY 4 SALE: Bill Babbitt, brother of the recently executed
Manny, is in Hollywood, shopping Manny's life story. Bill and San
Francisco PR whiz Lee Housekeeper are camped out at the Sportsman's
Lodge, entertaining bidders, and there are many.
</P>
<P>
   Free advice to Bill: Make the movie guys promise not to
Hollywoodize the story. Their favorite thing is to buy the rights
to a compelling real-life story, then invent key facts to punch it
up.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you were on Manny's side or not, you don't want to watch
the movie and say, ``I didn't know Manny Babbitt was married
briefly to Marilyn Monroe.''
</P>
<P>
   PACKING HEAT: Having survived the Bay to Breakers, Carolyne
Zinko and a friend boarded an N-Judah train heading back downtown.
It was packed solid and stiflingly hot.
</P>
<P>
   A rider pressed the intercom and begged the operator to turn on
the air conditioning. The operator explained that the AC was on the
blink, and so was the switch to shut off the heater. He told the
passengers he had begged the Muni mechanics to turn on the AC,
``but they didn't know how.''

SOX GET DROP ON YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-RED SOX-YANKEES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   Maybe there are better ways to spend $450 million, after all.
</P>
<P>
   On splendid May nights like this, when Yawkey Way trembles with
the chants of fans from Brighton and the Bronx, the Yankees are in
the third-base dugout and Boss Steinbrenner is strolling through
the stands, Pedro Martinez and David Cone are dueling on the hill,
and Derek Jeter and Nomar Garciaparra are comparing All-Star
pedigrees at short, perhaps it's best to quietly put away all the
pretty models of the future Fenway and savor the crusty antique,
just as it is.
</P>
<P>
   While Tuesday night's outcome could not diminish the poignancy
of Yankee manager Joe Torre's return from prostate cancer, the Red
Sox moved into sole possession of first place in the American
League East with a 6-3 win over New York, which dropped a half-game
back. The Sox, who have not been alone in first place this late in
a season since winning the division in 1995, have won 10 of their
last 12; the Yankees have lost 7 of 9.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez gave up hits (10) and racked up strikeouts (11) in
nearly equal measure Tuesday night, but drew a Maginot Line in the
sand when it came to giving up runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like all great pitchers, Pedro turns it up with runners in
scoring position,'' pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said of Martinez,
who stranded 13 Yankees in seven innings while permitting just two
New Yorkers safe passage home. ``It's just a quality that a great
starting pitcher has. Sabes (Bret Saberhagen) is like that, Ramon
(Martinez) is like that. They just reach down a little deeper.''
</P>
<P>
   Let the statmeisters sort through the strikeout numbers: seven
straight games of 10 strikeouts or more, at least one strikeout in
31 consecutive innings, and 102 K's this season, or more strikeouts
than any two other pitchers in the American League combined. The
poets will marvel at the soul of the slender Dominican who stranded
four Yankees on third base and ended five innings with strikeouts,
before leaving to a deafening ovation from a sellout crowd of
33,620.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been that way for a long time,'' said second baseman Jose
Offerman, whose shared history with Martinez extends through their
time together with the Dodgers and back to the Dominican Republic.
``He's just a tough guy when he's out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got something hard for us, to keep the game that way. But
he was able to do the job, which was exciting for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who leads the majors in wins with eight after strong
relief work by Rheal Cormier and Tom Gordon (save No. 5), struck
out the side and left with a 3-2 lead in the seventh, which ended
with World Series MVP Scott Brosius flinging his bat in frustration
after whiffing with runners on first and third.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get that many opportunities against a pitcher like
him,'' said Torre, whose 1999 debut was shrouded in secrecy until
he arrived here yesterday afternoon. ``We let him off the hook, but
you've got to give him credit. He reached back and did the job.''
</P>
<P>
   And had fun doing it, even though he required 36 pitches just to
get through the fifth inning, when the Yankees scored once and
might have had more except for Darren Lewis's head-banging catch of
O'Neill's drive to the wall in center. ``They put him through the
wringer there,'' Kerrigan said.
</P>
<P>
   But he came out intact on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a game and I enjoy the game,'' Martinez said. ``It
was a great opportunity for me to face those guys. If I retire
tomorrow, I have a chance to say, `I beat those guys.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my job. I enjoy every part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, held to Jason Varitek's swinging-bunt single
through the first four innings, trailed, 2-0, before finally
breaking through against Cone in the fifth. Mike Stanley, twice a
Yankee, twice a Red Sox, led off with his third home run, a
377-foot drive that was aided by a 10-mile-an-hour east wind to the
top of the wall in left-center field.
</P>
<P>
   One out later, Lewis singled to left. Trot Nixon flied deep to
center, but Offerman walked and both runners moved up on a passed
ball. Jeff Frye walked to load the bases and Reggie Jefferson
followed with a line single to right, scoring Lewis with the tying
run.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman tried to score the go-ahead run from second, but was
gunned down by O'Neill, the second time in two nights Offerman has
been erased on a play at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra led off the sixth with a double high off the
left-center field wall, took third as Troy O'Leary grounded out to
the right side, and scored on a wild pitch by Cone, the type of
imperfections the Yankees rarely showed en route to winning a
record 125 games last season.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch's throwing error in the eighth was another, as
the second baseman tried to do too much with Varitek's bases-loaded
grounder. Knoblauch, who was going to his left, reversed direction
and went airborne with his throw to second in an attempt to turn
two, but his throw rolled into short left field as two runs scored.
Nixon's ground ball brought home the final run, making it 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a little bit of fun in the middle of the season,''
Martinez said. ``To us, we're realistic. It's too early to compare
ourselves to them. They're the best team in the last 30 years. We
have to keep battling and hope to sneak by.''

SABRES BEAT BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
 HKN-BRUINS-SABRES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO _ Bruins president/general manager Harry Sinden said his
team's failure to beat the Sabres in the Eastern Conference
semifinals, which ended Tuesday night in a 3-2 loss in Game 6 at
Marine Midland Arena, boiled down to exactly one thing: His best
players, with the notable exception of captain Ray Bourque, were
simply not up to the task.
</P>
<P>
   Sinden singled out Jason Allison, who held out for a significant
pay increase last fall, and Dmitri Khristich, who took the club to
arbitration last summer, as the two most disappointing members of
the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a sixth game tonight and our best player was Ray
Bourque,'' said Sinden. ``Where the hell are all our young players?
When you have an inspiration like Ray Bourque, and you can't
respond to that inspiration, then as a young player, you've got to
look at yourself and say, `Wait a minute, am I good enough to be a
star player or a good player?' It's not talent. It's a Ray Bourque
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's a lack of experience, or a lack of understanding of
the price that has to be paid in the playoffs, but whatever it is,
Sinden said too few had what the 38-year-old Bourque had.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a guy, they booed him every time he touched the puck
and he was the best player on the ice,'' said Sinden. ``He was
fantastic. Do I get the response from my young players to his
performance? I don't get it. I'm not sure they get it. They have to
know what I'm trying to tell you. Until they understand what that
means, they will never ever, ever be a great team. You have to be
what Ray Bourque is, in your own level. We have some, but we don't
have enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden thought his team was mediocre Tuesday night and through
too much of the series. He thinks part of the reason Khristich and
Allison struggled was because of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a sixth game comes and you're going to be eliminated,
there's no room for just a mediocre display,'' he said. ``We paid a
few players this year and I don't think it helped them. As a matter
of fact, they were reduced in their capabilities. I don't think
Allison was the player he was last year, he wasn't the player he
should've been for one of our top-priced players in tonight's game.
That's his problem, not mine. I paid him. If you want it and you
get it, earn it. Earn it, baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fair to say things like that. I like Allison,
he's a terrific talent, but you've got to perform. You can't just
come out and say, `Here's a game in Buffalo, it's over, let's go
home.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden was even more pointed on Khristich, who once again is up
for a contract when July 1 rolls around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Khristich was a total, total disappointment,'' he said. ``All
he does is give the puck to the other team. He passes it to the
other team every time he gets it. He wants all this money because
he gets a few goals that are meaningless, really. Meaningless
goals. I need him in the playoffs. You need these high-priced
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not mad at either of them. I'm saying they want big money
_ I want it now. I want it now. In the four games we lost, we had
very few good players. Very few, and that was disappointing that we
should go up and down on the roller coaster like that. Most of them
worked their butts off, but some of our higher-priced players were
disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden thought coach Pat Burns and assistants Jacques Laperriere
and Bob Francis employed every possible tactic in an effort to make
the team competitive. They just didn't have enough help from their
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaching staff did a great job,'' said Sinden. ``They
tried traps, they tried forechecking, they tried everything. I
think it was a player issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden thinks management is going to have a good amount of work
ahead of it this summer to shore up the roster. It is likely the
brass will go out and get some experienced players to complement
their young talent. It was patently obvious throughout the playoffs
they didn't have enough depth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to come to grips with the fact that Buffalo outplayed
us,'' said Sinden. ``We have to face it and we have to get better.
This team is improving, we need some help. We have to do a little
better than we've done. We have to have some players who are a
little bit better than what we've got at some positions, no
question. Obviously, we're not good enough to go to the Stanley Cup
finals, which is our goal. But we're getting there. We have really
good young talent, we don't have enough maybe. This is a big,
difficult problem, these playoffs; you have to be on top of your
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo in general and this rink in particular have proven to be
dark places for the Bruins, and not just in the middle of winter.
The Bruins are 1-9-1 here since the arena opened, and they lost all
three postseason games.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Peca gave Buffalo the lead with a goal on the power play
at 5:15 of the first period. Steve Heinze answered for Boston, also
on the man advantage, at 12:49. Wayne Primeau made it 2-1 at 17:29,
a goal that really hurt the Bruins. Early in the second, Curtis
Brown made it a two-goal cushion at 1:08. In the third, Boston
pulled goalie Byron Dafoe for an extra attacker late and the move
paid off, with Joe Thornton beating Dominik Hasek at 18:57. But it
wasn't enough, and the series was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost four games and in the four games we lost, we played
terrible,'' said Sinden. ``We did not play well. If you don't play
well, you're going to lose, and Buffalo played really well. We
weren't able to counteract their forechecking, never, and so we got
beat.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is good news, Sinden said it's that the Bruins are a
much better team than two years ago, when they missed the playoffs,
and better than last year, when they were eliminated in the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a team that really has a chance to be something,'' he
said. ``They got beat by a team that really forechecked them, they
weren't ready for it and didn't know how to counteract it and
didn't counteract it. It had a lot to do with experience. I think
(Burns) knew exactly what he wanted them to do and they weren't
prepared to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a good team and they just ran into a team that was a
little better. Most of these guys gave a great effort, but I'm
disappointed that the people who are supposed to win you playoff
series didn't win us the playoff series.''

TORRE BEST OF NEW YORK STORIES 
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-SHAUGHNESSY COLUMN-BOS  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Yankees are in town, but Don Zimmer isn't managing and Roger
Clemens isn't pitching. Those boys from the Bronx simply have no
sense of drama. None at all.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening farewell for a now-officially-moribund Fenway
Park, the Yanks Tuesday night lost to Pedro Martinez, 6-3, and fell
into second place behind the surging Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   It was especially painful for New Yorkers because the fall from
first came on the night of Joe Torre's return to the bench. It
seems poor Joe just can't keep the Bombers on top the way Zim did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt very good, very calm,'' Torre said after the game, his
first since he was sidelined with prostate cancer during spring
training. ``There was no stress for me tonight. The only thing I
had to be careful of was my hands. I didn't want to reach up and
scratch something and all of a sudden there'd be some guy running
to second base.''
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner watched from his box next to the Yankee
dugout and was in Torre's office after the frustrating defeat. He
did not look particularly happy after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the loss, there was nonstop action on the visitors'
side of the field. Noble Torre was back in the corner office, Zim
was on the bench, holding a fungo bat, officially done as manager
for the last time. Meanwhile, the Rocket was meeting behind closed
doors with Torre, general manager Brian Cashman was again proving
to be the exact opposite of Dan Duquette (read: accessible), and
Steinbrenner was sitting in Box 65-D of a near-empty Fenway
discussing Torre, Zimmer, Clemens, old Fenway, new Fenway, and his
days running track for Williams in the old Boston Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Whew. All that and we hadn't even seen Pedro (11 more strikeouts
and 136 pitches) yet.
</P>
<P>
   The return of Torre qualifies as one of the feel-good stories of
the spring. The perfect manager for this near-perfect team, Torre
was diagnosed early in spring training and left the team for
surgery and recuperation.
</P>
<P>
   In Torre's absence, the Yankees turned to Zimmer, who honored
his friend by leaving the manager's office chair empty and refusing
the front-row seat on the team bus and airplane.
</P>
<P>
   All the Yankees had faith that Torre was coming back sometime
this summer, and the decision was made while the manager and his
wife had dinner at home Monday night. Torre called Steinbrenner
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``George kept saying, `Are you sure; are you sure?' '' said
Torre. ``He was flying today, getting in around two, so I asked him
if he could go a little earlier and we'd fly together.''
</P>
<P>
   They did. Torre was in the Yankee clubhouse by mid-afternoon.
The first players he saw were Jeff Nelson and Joe Girardi. And he
saw Zim. The infamous former Sox manager has been getting to the
park early for 51 years, and Tuesday was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer wasn't doing any formal interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm done with that,'' said the man who steered the S.S.
Steinbrenner for two months. ``I'm just a bench coach.''
</P>
<P>
   There's speculation in Yankeeland that Zimmer might quit. He has
been hobbled by a bum knee and threatened to retire once Torre
returned. His threats are sometimes ignored because he's retired a
couple of times already. The lovable Zim has become like the
neighborhood barkeep who gets into a snit with management and quits
every other weekend, only to return on Monday. He might be serious
this time. His knee is a legitimate pain, and it's no secret that
he feels unappreciated by the Boss.
</P>
<P>
   Sox fans were denied the delicious prospect of watching Zim
march out with the lineup card, but that's not as regrettable as
the Yankees' decision to bring Clemens off the disabled list Friday
in Chicago rather than Thursday at Fenway. Torre took credit/blame
for the decision, just as John McNamara didn't take the blame for
removing Clemens from Game 6 in '86.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the Rocket was magnificently obtuse, even by the
lofty standards he set during his 12-year Boston career. As if
trained in the Duquette school of no-pulse nonspeak, Clemens said
it made no difference whether he pitched here or at the new
Comiskey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I badly want to pitch, but we're just looking at the big
picture,'' said Clemens. ``There's no more distractions here than I
have when I pitch in Texas. I'm sure I'll pitch here again.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Rog. Does that mean you'll stare at the Jerry Reinsdorf
luxury box when you walk off the field after fanning 16 White Sox
Friday night?
</P>
<P>
   For New Yorkers, the bottom line is that the Yankees are whole
again. They have their trusty manager, they'll soon have another
ace, and Boston's flirtation with first should be brief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Torre is a player's manager,'' said the respectful Derek
Jeter. ``There's a calmness when he's around. Nothing seems to faze
him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a couple of months since things seemed normal,''
said Girardi. ``Joe's our leader, and we're accustomed to seeing
Joe in the leader's chair.''
</P>
<P>
   Proving that courage and class supersede even the polarizing
passion of the Red Sox-Yankee rivalry, many Fenway fans stood and
applauded madly when Torre brought out the lineup card before the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was moving,'' said the manager. ``I didn't want to take the
lineup card out, but I asked my bench coach (Zimmer) and he told me
I should take it out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre said his comeback had nothing to do with Boston and was
not expedited by New York's mid-May free-fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been taking my daughter to arts and crafts every
Tuesday,'' said Torre. ``My wife took her (yesterday), and I think
that was OK with her. I was happy to be going back to work. This is
where I want to be. We've created something special here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been ready for about a week. I'd been thinking about
coming back sometime during this series. So (Tuesday) morning I
called Zim and told him, `Are you ready to do the job you were
hired to do?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer was ready. George was ready. Roger was (almost) ready.
And the Yankees should be ready to resume the dominance that marked
their 1999 season under the steady hand of Torre.
</P>
<P>
   Now they just have to get climb over the first-place Red Sox.

MEXICO'S ZEDILLO, CALIFORNIA'S DAVIS STRESS CORDIAL RELATIONS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By ROBERT B. GUNNISON and CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SACRAMENTO _ Opening a historic three-day trip to California,
President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico proclaimed ``a new
understanding'' Tuesday with his northern neighbor and new era of
democracy in his own nation.
<P>
   It was a day of contrasts _ a warm official welcome from
Governor Gray Davis and cheers of ``Viva Mexico'' in the
Legislature, and angry protests against Mexican government policies
in Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Zedillo nor California politicians in their official
remarks mentioned Proposition 187, the 1994 anti-illegal immigrant
measure that irked Mexico. Instead, they used the coded language of
politics to try to put the issue behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new understanding to continue our path toward the
21st century with a productive, fruitful relationship for all, a
productive and fruitful relationship of friends and trade
partners,'' Zedillo told the Legislature in Spanish, which was
translated for his audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have come to California to reassure you, to reassure the
Mexican-origin population and all inhabitants of California, that
we are working very hard in Mexico to build a future of prosperity
and justice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his introduction, Davis, who met with Zedillo in Mexico City
in January, said California's antagonistic attitude toward Mexico
is a thing of the past. ``Those days are gone forever,'' he said.
``You do the state of California and the people of California a
great honor with your presence.''
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco Tuesday night, Zedillo explained to a packed
audience his long absence from California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a coincidence that for more than four years I
couldn't come here,'' he told the crowd of 2,000 at a meeting of
the Commonwealth Club of California and the World Affairs Council.
</P>
<P>
   There were, he said, ``certain circumstances'' _ his way of
saying that former Gov. Pete Wilson made him unwelcome because of
the Proposition 187 campaign and the Republican governor's attacks
on illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   ``And besides,'' he said, ``I was not invited.'' The Fairmont
Hotel audience roared with laughter.
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, a questioner in the audience asked Zedillo
what steps he was taking to counter the ``anti-Mexican backlash''
sponsored by the previous administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sentiment was ill-founded,'' the president said, ``and
probably it was not right to feed that sentiment. We have the will
to take very concrete steps to show people it is better to work
together than to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   The only time the words ``Proposition 187'' were actually
mentioned came in a reporter's question _ during the first press
conference Zedillo has given since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   While Mexico bitterly condemned Wilson for his support of
Proposition 187, Zedillo was careful not to criticize Davis for his
decision to appeal a federal court ruling against the measure,
which halts government services, including education, for illegal
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trust Gray Davis, and I hope and trust and know there will
be in the end a good solution regarding this issue,'' he said in
response to the question.
</P>
<P>
   While California politicians used Zedillo's visit to try to show
themselves friends of Mexico and of the state's large Latino
population, Zedillo had a message of his own _ that his nation is
becoming more democratic and more stable for economic investment.
Mexico is now the state's No. 1 trading partner.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived one day after his Institutional Revolutionary Party,
which has held power for seven decades, agreed to the first
nationwide presidential primary later in November.
</P>
<P>
   The primary will end the tradition of Mexican presidents
selecting their successors and will allow voters to pick their
nominee for the general election in July 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in English to a luncheon audience of several hundred
local business and political leaders, Zedillo said his nation has
``a new kind of political stability that will make it more
realistic to reach our economic targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo also may have been speaking to potential voters. Some
Latino activists want legislation in Mexico that would allow more
than 3 million Mexican citizens living in California to vote in the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   As Zedillo arrived at the Capitol, California Highway Patrol
officers on horseback efficiently swept dozens of chanting
protesters out of the president's view.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators, many of them supporters of the Zapatista
movement in Chiapas, carried effigies of the Mexican president,
with blistering signs reading: ``Why does Zedillo kill families in
Chiapas?'' and ``Why does Zedillo kill Mexico's poor?''
</P>
<P>
   After the police did their work, the protesters were quickly
replaced by a line of enthusiastic students, carrying ``Welcome to
California'' signs. A smattering of boos was drowned out by the
students directly in front, who cheered lustily for the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should know that there is a problem,'' said Marianna
Rivera, a member of the Zapatista Solidarity Coalition. ``The
Mexican government abuses its own people. They have been the party
in power for 70 years. They are totally corrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatista movement began in January 1994 in southern Chiapas
state in the name of greater rights for indigenous people. The
conflict, especially a 1997 massacre of 45 Indians in the Chiapas
village of Acteal, has received international attention.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 people spent the morning in front of the Capitol,
several holding aloft a large papier-mache figure of Zedillo with a
sign denouncing him as a puppet of the rich. Blocked behind metal
barriers, the protesters faced the red carpet that Zedillo and
Davis had used to enter the Capitol and prayed and performed an
Aztec dance.
</P>
<P>
   Around the corner, the fourth annual immigrant lobby day was
taking place. The timing was coincidental but appropriate, said
Angie Wei of the California Immigrant Welfare Collaborative, which
coordinated the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are glad President Zedillo could be here to join in our
efforts for better treatment of immigrants,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the protest was Davis' decision to seek federal
appellate court mediation of Proposition 187. Davis, although
opposed to the measure, said he was obligated to continue the
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Zedillo plans to travel to Los Angeles for more
speeches, a town hall meeting and a state dinner in Beverly Hills.
Thursday, he will read to a bilingual elementary school in Los
Angeles, then travel to San Diego for another speech before
returning to Mexico.

THIS BRUINS TEAM HAS A FUTURE

<P>
   BUFFALO _ Here's what you should remember about the 1998-99
Boston Bruins:
</P>
<P>
   That with a minute and change left, and with a two-goal deficit
that had been sitting up there for more than a period and with the
sellout Marine Midland Arena crowd of more than 18,000 chanting
``We Want The Leafs!'' while waving thousands of white pom-poms,
and with the cumulative effect of a lot of hits and a lot of
hard-skating shifts and with the thought of a nice hot shower
almost impossible to suppress, Joe Thornton _ the now fully-minted
Hope of the Future _ redirected a Mattias Timander six-on-five slap
shot past the almighty goaltender Dominik Hasek and suddenly those
18,000-plus people were in bad need of a wee-wee.
</P>
<P>
   OK, the final was Buffalo 3, Boston 2. Both the series and the
season are over. Buffalo now will play Toronto in an Eastern
Conference final made in newspaper beancounters heaven. (Wow! 60
miles apart. No hotel stays! Um, you think you guys could car
pool?) The Bruins didn't win because they weren't quite good enough
to win, but they did what all the beloved Bruins teams of yore
would have done, which was to let the Sabres know that a 60-minute
hockey game is a 60-minute hockey game. ``We played hard right to
the buzzer,'' said coach Pat Burns. ``You have to be proud of those
guys, and I am.''
</P>
<P>
   The night had ``celebration'' written all over it. The Sabres
had the 3-2 series lead, they had the home ice, and they had the
Great Hasek. Then they even got the first goal, which, according to
conventional wisdom, should have decided things right there. But it
didn't, because Steve Heinze tied it up before the first period was
over.
</P>
<P>
   But Wayne Primeau made it 2-1 before the period's end, and the
pesky Curtis Brown (3-2_5 in this series) took advantage of a
fairly complete Bruins breakdown to make it 3-1 after two periods,
and for the Bruins, the third period would be like trying to run up
Mt. Washington while carrying a Hammond organ. The crowd was
getting whoopier and whoopier, and why not? Buffalo in the winter
and spring is a one-sport town. Sabres rule. And for the second
year in a row, they are going to the conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are going home. They now can admit it: They are
whipped, physically, mentally, and perhaps even emotionally. They
have just played 12 grueling playoff games, and I mean grueling.
Bruins hockey ain't no Ice Chips, pal. Bruins hockey ain't pretty;
no how, no way. Bruins hockey is body-sacrificing, gut-check
hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love coming to games this time of the year,'' said Anson
Carter. ``The sun is out. You wear shorts to practice. But then you
lose and it's like a punch in the face. Tired? Yes, I'm tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody but everybody had said before the playoffs began that
the East was a thoroughly unpredictable hodgepodge in which
seedings meant nothing. Sure enough, only one of the top four seeds
(Toronto) remained after the first round. This series was a battle
between No. 6 (Boston) and No. 7 (Buffalo). Everything that
everybody had said was the gospel truth. And that's why this will
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't be watching the Toronto-Buffalo series,'' vowed
Heinze, who came up awfully big in the playoffs. ``We thought we
could go farther. We believe we have something special here. It was
just a matter of a bounce, one way or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A few shifts here and a few shifts there in their favor,''
agreed Rob DiMaio. ``That was the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   That might have been an oversimplification, but Heinze and
DiMaio can be forgiven. Like everyone else in the room, they had
given everything there was to give, and now they were hurting
inside, completely firm in the belief that the Buffalo team
advancing to play Toronto isn't a damn bit better than they are,
starting with the goaltender.
</P>
<P>
   Dominik Hasek may be Dominik Hasek, but he did not win this
series for the Sabres. ``That was never even a question,''
maintained Carter. ``We knew from our experience and from watching
the tapes that Buffalo was not a one-man team. One individual
wasn't going to beat us _ and he didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Trading Byron Dafoe for Hasek wouldn't have improved the Bruins'
chances. Trading just about anybody for Michael Peca would have.
The nasty forward with the angelic face (and amazingly tiny body)
did everything he was supposed to do, including scoring the game's
first goal Tuesday night. One thing that might improve the Bruins'
chances of continuing this step-by-step march to the Stanley Cup
would be to study tapes of Peca's six-game series in the hopes of
figuring out just how this wonderful player does what he does.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins didn't leave anything in reserve. What they had to
give was what we got to see, and that includes every trick Burns
could think of. The mentor railed about physical play throughout,
accusing Peca of ``getting away with murder'' and moaning that Ken
Belanger constantly was being targeted by officials with ``radar''
trained on No. 18, and No. 18 alone. I would say the chances of an
``I told ya' so'' tumbling out of Burns's lips when Belanger was
sent off for roughing in the second period were pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff shrugged it all off, often answering
with playful jests of his own. ``What Pat said didn't anger me,''
Ruff declared. ``He was just doing his best to disrupt my thought
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns did what he did because all is fair in love, war, and
Stanley Cup series. You prod and push and jolt your own team. You
make public appeals to the referees. You do whatever it takes,
especially when you know in your heart of hearts that the other
team is more experienced and just plain savvier in the whys and
wherefores of playoff hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing, 3-1, the season a little more than a minute away from
its conclusion, the Bruins put a smile on the crusty coach's face.
They ensured that Buffalo would stagger, not swagger, its way to
the finals.
</P>
<P>
   They may be tired and frustrated today, but we know one thing
for sure. Their pride is intact. The Bruins will be back.

M'S TREAT TWINS TO THREE-MARTINEZ LAUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ On a night against the Twins, Edgar Martinez provided
triplets.
</P>
<P>
   Over 24 hours, he threw a party of five.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it was a birth announcement people won't soon
forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I played the last two days, I think I'm better than
ever,'' the 36-year-old Martinez said. ``I feel like 21.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking batting practice at the expense of Minnesota for the
second consecutive night, the Mariners designated hitter launched
three home runs to help punish the visitors 10-1 at the Kingdome
Tuesday _ giving him five long balls in two games and the second
hat trick of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's two-game outburst tied a major league record, making
him the 21st player to pull this feat.
</P>
<P>
   He hit one to each field in the fifth, sixth and eighth innings,
giving him seven homers for the season.
</P>
<P>
   And people said he was in a batting slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have occasional power, but five in two days?'' said
Martinez, who has been on a tear since sitting out Sunday's
contest. ``You see guys like Junior (Ken Griffey Jr.) do it. I
guess it amazes me.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's efforts meshed nicely with another superb outing by
rookie pitcher Freddy Garcia, who was back after a 10-day injury
layoff, prompted by a Chili Davis liner that tattooed his right
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia didn't leave until he said so this time. So fluid and
poised for his 22 years, he allowed just the one run on seven hits,
walking one and striking out three.
</P>
<P>
   That brought Garcia a team-leading fifth victory in six
decisions, the Mariners a season-best-tying third win in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The home club (18-21) will try pull off its first series sweep
of the season against the Twins Wednesday night, concluding a
six-game homestand before touring Kansas City and Minnesota.
Long-suffering M's lefty Jeff Fassero will face the Twins' Mike
Lincoln. The way things have been reversing themselves lately,
Fassero might find some solace.
</P>
<P>
   When Garcia went down in New York, the big right-hander was one
of the few good things the Mariners had going. He's just one of the
guys now.
</P>
<P>
   Another would be Ken Griffey Jr., who smacked his
major-league-leading 15th homer into the right-field seats in the
first inning, getting the onslaught rolling. With a nice easy
swing, Griffey reached for a low delivery on the first offering
from Dan Perkins and sent it into a tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   And now Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time AL batting champ was slumping, his average at an
unEdgar-like .277, hearing the same subtle digs he's been hearing
for the past couple years _ that he finally might be slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   All that makes him do is shrug. And start hitting like an
absolute mad man.
</P>
<P>
   After grounding out and flying out, the Martinez rampage got
started in the sixth. He led off with a homer to right, the ball
slicing away from him for a 6-1 Mariner lead.
</P>
<P>
   He said the pitch was high in the strike zone, a little outside.
Swat.
</P>
<P>
   An inning later, Martinez pulled one to left with Alex Rodriguez
aboard, putting his club up 9-1.
</P>
<P>
   He saw a slider down the middle of the plate. Boom.
</P>
<P>
   For good measure, Martinez led off the eighth with a blast to
straightaway center, putting a final exclamation mark on a
power-filled evening.
</P>
<P>
   High and down the middle. Gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a joke,'' Mariner backup catcher Tom Lampkin said.
``That was unbelievable. It didn't even look like he was swinging
at them.''
</P>
<P>
   Said manager Lou Piniella, ``One of Edgar's strengths his whole
career is he can use (the field) line to line. That's why you see
him with a .320 career batting average.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, his homer exploits themselves awe-inspiring, presented
Martinez with three cigars, one for each long ball. Moments before,
he had teased his teammate, asking him what time they were going to
eat?
</P>
<P>
   Providing a translation, Martinez said, ``He wants to know what
I've been eating these last few days.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's other three-homer night came in July 1996 at Texas.
This one was better, because he supposedly wasn't swinging as well.
</P>
<P>
   As he wrapped up his interviews, Martinez was asked if he would
sit for an ESPN radio interview, a little national exposure. He
said he would if there was time.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was headed for a postgame workout.
</P>
<P>
   Don't all 21-year-olds do that?

ANOTHER DODGERS STARTER STRUGGLES ON MOUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Dodgers left-hander Carlos Perez
lasted 31/3 innings against the Houston Astros, which is indicative
of the state of the supposed strength of the Dodgers. On nights
Kevin Brown isn't on the mound, the Dodgers starters aren't
pitching well, nor are they pitching deep into games.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Dodgers were lambasted by the Houston Astros 11-3 in
the first of a three-game series Tuesday at Dodger Stadium, a
prophetic manager Davey Johnson talked about just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you asked me (in March) in the middle of May what would I
be worried about, and you said the starting pitching not giving me
enough innings, I'd say you were crazy,'' Johnson said. ``We're
still young. (Still) outthinking yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   And still pitching poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, the poster child for the Dodgers' struggling starters
this season, dug his team a 6-0 hole by the fourth inning that made
Raul Mondesi's three-run homer (his 14th) of little help. The
Astros' five-run eighth inning against rookie Jamie Arnold only
ended the misery a bit early as Jose Lima improved to 7-1 with
seven solid innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlos wasn't real sharp,'' Johnson said. ``He needs maybe a
little regular work. He's been sporadic, between his off days and
his injury. He's not in a groove now. He'll get it.''
</P>
<P>
   But can the Dodgers afford to wait for Perez (1-5) to get there,
especially with the way they've pitched in May? Starters without
the Brown surname haven't thrown a pitch in the eighth inning this
month. Only Chan Ho Park finished the seventh inning, which he's
done twice.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of starting pitching on Johnson's spring training
checklist was the bullpen, the second slot in the batting order,
the health of catcher Todd Hundley's elbow, some golf in Vero Beach
and how the fish were biting.
</P>
<P>
   With Brown, Park, Ismael Valdes, Perez and Darren Dreifort in
the rotation _ not to mention Dave Mlicki as an insurance policy _
getting innings out of the starters wasn't a concern. Now, it is
 &UR; !ital! &LR; the &UR; !off! &LR;  concern.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is the only starter with an ERA under three, at 2.75.
Valdes (4-1, 3.40) is off to his best start, but blisters have
limited his innings.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dreifort (4.61), Perez (6.63) and Park (5.32) have
all been hit hard lately. Other than Brown, the Dodgers starters
have averaged less than six innings per outing. Perez, who wasn't
around to answer questions after allowing six runs on five hits,
epitomizes the starter's problems. He can't pitch deep into games,
averaging 51/3 innings per start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Velocity-wise, the last two starts he's had the best fastball
he's had in his career,'' Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley said.
``That's what is so frustrating about it. You go fastball away _
ball one. Fastball away _ ball two. And you have to go to the soft
stuff and try to trick the hitter. They were biting early and they
made the adjustment.''
</P>
<P>
   Without question, Perez has been the biggest disappointment, a
trend that continued against the National League Central-leading
Astros. They entered the night feasting on left-handed pitching,
hitting .362 against southpaws, and they devoured Perez. It took
them only an inning to get their timing on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know he's going to throw a lot of change-ups,'' Houston
catcher Tony Eusebio said. ``He tried to come in one me, but I
don't think it was enough. He tried to come inside and he left it
down the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   And Eusebio hit it 435 feet for a two-run homer and a 4-0
Houston lead in the third inning. They scored two more in the
fourth on an RBI double from Bagwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the game we were pounding them in with fastballs and
stayed away from the offspeed stuff,'' Hundley said. ``The second
time through they caught onto it.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only good news for the Dodgers is that Brown pitches
today.

QUAYLE NO LONGER ALONE ON `FAMILY VALUES' PLATFORM
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Exactly seven years ago, Vice President Dan
Quayle blasted America's cultural landscape by attacking the
hippest feminist and single mom on television _ Murphy Brown.
</P>
<P>
   His now-famous ``Poverty of Values'' speech in San Francisco, in
which he lambasted the popular TV character for choosing to be a
single mom, put Quayle on the front lines of the family values
debate and made him the punch line of late-night TV talk shows
across America.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Quayle will mark the anniversary of the ``Murphy
Brown'' speech with another address to the Commonwealth Club of
California as he attempts to move from dark horse to front-runner
in the race for the GOP presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But this year he is hardly a lone voice on family values. A pack
of presidential hopefuls _ Republicans and Democrats alike _ are
rushing to champion the issue.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of incidents of youth violence, including the
Littleton massacre, the question of family values resonates with
more voters and politicians, experts say. If the 1996 election was
about ``the economy, stupid,'' some pundits suggest next year's
vote will be about what's close to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Baby Boomers have kids, and they're starting to get
grandkids ... but while there's a sense that the economy's doing
great, it's not enough,'' said Karl Rove, chief strategist to the
campaign of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who has stressed issues like
juvenile crime, welfare reform and family health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government plays a role in that _ encouraging a society of
responsibility, in which people attempt to do their best,'' Rove
said.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing dialogue on the issue by a host of presidential
hopefuls underscores both the enduring appeal of family values as a
political theme and its evolution as America heads into the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle kicked off the debate in 1992 when he delivered the
speech in San Francisco that vilified one of America's most popular
TV characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't help matters when prime-time TV has Murphy Brown, a
character who supposedly epitomizes today's intelligent, highly
paid professional women, mocking the importance of fathers by
bearing a child alone and calling it just another `lifestyle
choice,''' Quayle told the Commonwealth Club of California in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle spokesman Jonathan Baron says the former vice president
``clearly won the debate on the debate over values. ... (He) made
it safe for the political leaders to confront the decline in the
culture that threatens so much of our society.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that was the beginning,'' Baron said. ``Now he is on a
mission to achieve a restoration of values.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle is hardly alone in that quest.
</P>
<P>
   These days, ``Republicans, Democrats, you name it _ everyone
wants family values. ... Everyone agrees they're important,'' said
GOP analyst Dan Schnur. ``The partisan debate is now over the role
of government in the family values arena.''
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats, the discussion of family values encompasses
topics like violence prevention, mental health services and even
old-fashioned parental controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better to give a kid a rule to break than no rule at
all,'' said Tipper Gore, wife of Vice President and Democratic
front-runner Al Gore, in a recent interview with The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, that's what I do as a parent,'' she said. ``I'm not
saying my kids are perfect. But it is up to us to teach our
children values.''
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore has discussed her own bout with depression and the
need for more counseling services while pushing her husband's
proposals on education, guns and youth violence. For Republicans,
family values can range from Pat Buchanan's emphasis on religious
values to Elizabeth Dole's support for gun control to Gary Bauer's
critique of homosexuality to the parental responsibility issues
raised by Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I have five daughters. If that's not a reality
check (on family values), I don't know what is,'' said Forbes, in
an interview in Sacramento last week.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the Littleton tragedy, Forbes said it isn't a
question of gun control but a return to the high expectations and
strict guidelines that many Baby Boomer parents like himself recall
from their own youth.
</P>
<P>
   Among the presidential hopefuls lining up to stake their claim
to the issue:
</P>
<P>
   -- Gore, who unveiled a detailed educational plan this week,
calling for increased school discipline, including
``second-chance'' schools to help at-risk kids and a host of other
proposals that he said would improve the prospects for both kids
and families in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   -- Senator John McCain, R-Ariz., who was part of the original
V-chip coalition. He joined Democratic Senator Joseph Lieberman, of
Connecticut, in introducing a resolution calling for the surgeon
general to study the impact of media violence on children.
</P>
<P>
   -- Elizabeth Dole, who has argued passionately for gun control
in recent weeks and has called for programs for at-risk youth and
educational reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah DiVito Hardman, former president of the California
Christian Coalition and now grassroots state coordinator for
Forbes, said voters are now as concerned with their families'
spiritual well-being as they are with their economic health.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are starting to look at the big picture, and they're
seeing things here and there,'' Hardman said. ``It's not just
Littleton ... (but Littleton) creates a fear _ and fear is a
terribly motiving factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who have been out front on the family values issue haven't
necessarily found it easy to be pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan Quayle ... set off a match in a gas can when he delivered
the Murphy Brown speech,'' said Leslie Goodman, a GOP consultant
and editor of politicalaccess.com, a leading political Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a crusader for something he's felt strongly about,''
and should have been applauded, not ridiculed, she said. ``Tipper
Gore has been a leader of another crusade, and she talks about
mental health and the availability of counseling. ... That's
another piece of the puzzle.''
</P>
<P>
   California Gov. Gray Davis' wife, Sharon, who is outspoken on
family issues, recalled that ``people ridiculed (Tipper Gore) and
said she should be minding her own business ... (but) I admire her
for being right at the cutting edge at a time when it wasn't
popular. It's so easy to get on the bandwagon after you've had a
huge tragedy like Littleton.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Quayle is hoping to position himself at the center of
the values debate for the year 2000. ``Remember, Murphy Brown is
gone, and I'm still here fighting for the American people,'' Quayle
said, in announcing his presidential run earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Reprising that theme _ and the speech is San Francisco _ is a
savvy but risky idea, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``By coming back for the sequel, he's reminding people his
original point was a good one,'' said Schnur.
</P>
<P>
   But ``you cannot give an I-told-you-so speech,'' said one GOP
insider. ``(That) doesn't get us where we need to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman, a Bush supporter, cited the Texas governor's successful
youth and volunteer programs as evidence of the family values that
Americans will demand in the next election. The successful
presidential candidate for the year 2000, she said, will be
``talking about what should be and will be. Lay out your game plan,
and tell us the solutions you propose.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT SUMMARY -- No. 431 -- May 19, 1999 We are offering
the following articles for sale. Please contact us for availability
your country. Best regards, Karl Horwitz
</P>
<P>
   1. RACHEL, RACHEL Rachel Weisz, 28, worked hard at not growing
up - until now. Although she earned a reputation for dating her
co-stars and appearing nude on screen, this English stage and film
actress may be getting ready to act like an adult. Responsibility
looms with three movies due out in the U.S: the $90 million remake
of ``The Mummy,'' Michael Winterbottom's dark sexual thriller ``I
Want You,'' and the historical epic ``The Taste of Sunshine,''
co-starring Ralph Fiennes and William Hurt. By James Fallon. W
Magazine. 1,500 words + photos.
</P>
<P>
   2. FOLK HEROES : PETER, PAUL AND MARY TUNE UP FOR THE
</P>
<P>
   NEXT MILLENNIUM It's been almost four decades since three folk
singers combined talents for a concert at Greenwich Village's
``Bitter End'' coffee house, and Peter, Paul and Mary are still
going strong. Their latest album, ``Songs of Conscience and
Concern'' is a collection of their lesser-known songs that they
feel deserve a wider audience, and one new song, ``Don't Laugh At
Me,'' whose message seems especially appropriate in the wake of the
tragedy in Littleton, Colorado. By Bonnie Siegler. 1,500 words +
photos.
</P>
<P>
   3. MOVIES AREN'T THE VILLAIN Gary Ross, a writer and director
whose films include ``Big,'' ``Dave'' and ``Pleasantville,'' writes
that it is absurd to blame the movie industry for a climat of
violence in which a tragedy such as the Littleton school massacre
can occur. New York Times Op-Ed. 800 words.
</P>
<P>
   4. STAR WARS PACKAGE We are offering the following features to
celebrate the opening of the film ``The Phantom Menace'': A. The
Force Is With Samuel L. Jackson cf ENT. 429 B. The Man Who Would Be
Obi-Wan Kenobi cf ENT. 429 C. Fans in the Grip of 'Star Wars' Fever
cf ENT. 429 D. Force Field : A 'Star Wars Quiz' cf ENT. 429 E. The
Source Behind the Force : 'Star Wars' Producer Rick McCallum. F.
Liam Neeson interview cf ENT. 429 Art is available. Please contact
us for further details.

   5. THE GIRL WHO WOULD BE QUEEN : NATALIE PORTMAN TALKS
</P>
<P>
   'STAR WARS' Natalie Portman won't be waiting to see the film
``Star Wars : The Phantom Menace'' (in which she plays Queen
Amidala,) on its release day in the U.S. The 17-year-old will be
taking her biology final ... By Cindy Pearlman. 1,500 words.
________________________________________________________ 6.
EVERETT'S PEAK After an auspicious debut, Rupert Everett struggled
for years under his own notoriety as Hollywood's gay poster boy.
Now with three movies coming out, he's back on top. By Merle
Ginsberg. From W Magazine. 1,500 words + photo.
</P>
<P>
   7. MR. NICE GUY Capital punishment may be a divisive issue but
it has been very good to Alice Cooper. It's been a big part of the
singer's professional life as he has been ``executed'' night after
night on the concert stages of the world for more than a quarter of
a century. Cooper may die for his sins, but he always comes back
from the grave, prancing and preening. ``Always with the best of
taste,'' he adds. By Jim Sullivan. BPI. 1,300 words + photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 8.
THE ROMANCE IS BACK FOR HUGH GRANT Hugh Grant's appeal has survived
several resounding box-office flops and even some Divine
intervention. He may soon be more popular than ever, as he returns
to romantic comedy - the genre most favoured by his fans - for
``Notting Hill,'' co-starring Julia Roberts. He admits that the
film's look at celebrity, the tabloid press and the paparazzi hit
home for him. By Ian Spelling. 1,500 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 9.
T2 : 3D ONE OF A KIND SPECTACLE Universal Studios has developed the
ultimate attraction for movie fanatics. It's not just a 3D film,
its a multi-sensory ride that virtually delivers the audience
straight into the 1991 Arnold Schwarzenegger blockbuster
``Terminator 2.'' ``Terminator 2: 3D'' combines the most
sophisticated 3D imaging with live-action stunt work, blurring the
line between the silver screen and reality. By Tamara Conniff. BPI.
800 words + photos.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Now the tough part
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The impressive election of Ehud Barak as prime minister of
Israel is, most agree, convivial to the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is a general and a national hero like his great
predecessor, Yitzhak Rabin. That gets him some initial respect.
(Like Rabin, he has only small reserves of charisma. The defeated
Benjamin Netanyahu had tons of charisma, and look where that got
him.)
</P>
<P>
   Barak will guard Israel's borders without giving away the store.
He can trade some West Bank land for time. The West Bank has always
been an overly hyped issue. More substantive matters _ security,
economics, water _ have never really been seriously visited. Then
there are the intransigents who have never been rendered placable
about anything _ Israel's vivacious far right, Hamas, Hezbollah,
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   New ideas are needed. Everyone stays busy verifying the old
ones. If Ehud Barak has any, now's the time.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Question: &LR;  I often get e-mail from people whom I'd like to add
to my Address Book, but creating new contacts is time-consuming. Is
there an easy way in Outlook 98 to transfer e-mail addresses in
messages to the Address Book?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Indeed, there is. Open up the message. Now right-click
on the sender's e-mail address, which you'll see on the From: line
at the top of the window. Choose Add to Contacts from the menu that
pops up. This will bring up the Contact dialog box and
automatically insert the e-mail address. You also can use the box
to add other useful information you may have about the person, such
as a phone number. When you're done, click Save and Close.

   Q: I am running Windows 98 on a fairly new computer. When I'm
using Internet Explorer 4, I often get ``frozen'' and can't escape
the program. As a result, I am forced to shut down by turning the
power off. Is there some way to get the computer to quit the
program without having to do that?
</P>
<P>
   A: I have an uncle who sometimes freezes, and we've found that
the best way to get him going again is to shout at him. But yelling
at your computer isn't going to help. There is something you can
try, however. Press one of the Control keys (they're probably
labeled Ctrl) and, at the same time, press one of the Alt keys and
the Delete key. This will display the Close Program box. In theory,
if you then click End Task, the program will close and you can get
back to business.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the Ctrl-Alt-Del combination sometimes doesn't
work. In which case you can do one of two things: Press
Ctrl-Alt-Del twice in a row, which should restart the computer, or
do what you've been doing and shut down the system.
</P>
<P>
   Because your problem seems to happen most often in Internet
Explorer 4, you also might try downloading the latest version of
the browser, IE 5, which may prove more stable for you. You can get
it for free at www.microsoft.com/ie.
</P>
<P>
   Font Frenzy
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there way to print out all the fonts in Word 97 for
comparative viewing? If not, is there another resource for doing
it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Windows only lets you print separate samples of each font. To
do that, go to Fonts in the Control Panel (Start
Button/Settings/Control Panel/Fonts), double-click a font and click
Print.
</P>
<P>
   That having been said, there are some good third-party programs
that can print the comparative lists for you. One that's gotten
high marks in reviews is FontLister, a $5 shareware program that
you can download from ZDNet's software library at www.hotfiles.com.
</P>
<P>
   At the same site, you also can download a free program that lets
you view a sample list of fonts right from the Word toolbar _ which
may save you the trouble of having to print them. This is a feature
that Microsoft has included in some other programs, notably
Publisher, but which for some reason hasn't been available in Word.
(It will be, however, with the arrival of Office 2000 next month.)
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the program you should try is called ``Enhanced
Drop-Down Font List for MS Word 97,'' which is about as descriptive
as a name can get.
</P>
<P>
   CD-ROM Facts
</P>
<P>
   Q: Currently my system has a 40x CD-ROM drive. I would like to
install a recordable CD-ROM drive (CDR) so I can record stuff on
CDs for backup purposes. But the CDR I have in mind has a slower
reading speed than the CD-ROM drive I already have. Is it possible
to have two CD drives at the same time?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure it's possible, but I don't know whether there's much
advantage to it. The CDR drive you're contemplating probably reads
at 24x, which is plenty fast. And since it can also read ordinary
CDs, it would make your existing CD-ROM drive redundant.
</P>
<P>
   One benefit of having two CD drives is that you could copy a CD
directly. But that's time consuming, and it's actually easier to
``rip'' information off a CD, store it temporarily on your hard
drive, then write it to a blank CD. And for that procedure, all you
need is the CDR.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TIP OF THE WEEK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Tired of the same old sounds that your computer emits when you
start Windows, shut down your system or perform other Windows
functions? You can easily customize your system with short audio
clips that you can record or download from the Web. Once you have
the sounds on your hard drive (they must be stored in ``.wav''
files), use the Sounds feature in the Windows Control Panel to
substitute them for the boring Windows sounds.

INTERNET'S TOP PLAYERS MIX STRATEGY, GRIT TO SURVIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ In December 1997, when the cappuccino
machine first appeared at the headquarters of Yahoo Inc., it didn't
deliver quite the jolt that executives had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were e-mails to me and everybody saying this is
rubbish,'' recalls company president Jeff Mallett. ``Why are we
wasting money on a cappuccino machine? Let's put it back into the
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Only when workers learned that Yahoo founders David Filo and
Jerry Yang had paid for the machine from their own pockets did
their outrage subside.
</P>
<P>
   It's plainly one of Mallett's favorite stories, part of the
Yahoo mystique. Here's one of the Internet's premier firms, a
company with a stock market value of $30 billion, and it still
revels in its scrappy image.
</P>
<P>
   Just as well. Because Yahoo and other elite Internet firms can't
afford to forget that they're in the fight of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the high values the market has placed on Internet
stocks. Most of the high-flyers earn slim profits, if any. But the
stocks stay up thanks to investors who believe that some of these
hot companies will still be hot _ and profitable _ a few years down
the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully believe that many of the Web companies that we see
today will become mammoths of the next millennium. But many more
will cease to exist,'' says Bob Davis, chief executive of Waltham,
Mass. Web service Lycos Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Already there's a top tier of firms like Yahoo, Amazon.com and
America Online Inc., companies so well entrenched that only a drop
in the IQ of top managers could kill them. The eBay auction site
has established itself as the standard by which on-line auction
sites are judged. Other companies, like Lycos, have built huge
audiences but are still trying to lock down a position of industry
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Pay close attention, and it's clear that all of the hot Net
firms have bet on a set of basic strategies they think will assure
their survival and dominance over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  At first glance, the Web titans seem to face a simple
problem: Anybody can do what they do. Internet access and Web
technologies are available to all. In theory, any small-timer with
a good idea could knock Yahoo or eBay off its perch virtually
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, it's not that simple. Most of the leaders were among
the first in their niche _ Yahoo and Lycos in Web searching, eBay
in auctions, Amazon in retailing. In an infant industry, their head
start has helped establish them as recognized brand names. Now
they're spending millions to lock in their brands and freeze out
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's done it better than AOL. It was once dwarfed by firms
like Prodigy and CompuServe. But TV and print ads, and a tidal wave
of free AOL software disks have made the firm perhaps the
best-known name on the Internet. AOL's research claims that over
half of all Americans think of AOL when they think of the Internet,
while fewer than one-tenth think of Yahoo or Microsoft. Brags AOL
Interactive Services Group president Barry Schuler: ``America
Online, when it comes to on-line services, is the only company
that's a true national brand.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Internet companies are aiming to win superbrand status
for themselves. Amazon, for instance, is stifling a competitive
threat from rival on-line bookseller Barnes &AMP; Noble.com by using
aggressive pricing and heavy advertising. Amazon's first-quarter
revenue of $293.6 million far outstripped Barnes &AMP; Noble's $32.3
million. David Risher, Amazon's vice president of marketing, says
the power of the Amazon brand deserves much of the credit. ``You
talk to a lot of people, they don't tell you they bought a book or
a CD,'' says Risher. ``They tell you they bought it at
Amazon.com.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  And Amazon regulars find it's ridiculously simple to keep on
buying. That's because the company created a system that memorizes
address and credit card data the first time a customer buys. To buy
another book tomorrow, there's no need to retype the data.
</P>
<P>
   It's part of another vital leadership strategy _ keeping it
simple.
</P>
<P>
   Early commercial Web sites were saturated with color photos and
dancing animated images _ stuff that can take forever to download
on a home computer. Yahoo was having none of it. ``Users don't want
that,'' Mallett says. ``What users want is fast, clean and so
forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Yahoo has never strayed from its bland
blue-on-white graphics and near-total absence of graphics. And the
company still has a team of living, breathing humans at its Santa
Clara, Calif. campus who spend their days creating the Yahoo Web
index. Instead of overwhelming the searcher with millions of
``hits,'' Yahoo displays a list of categories that quickly guide
the user to the needed information. These days, practically every
search site on the Web emulates Yahoo's simple design.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  Simplicity has its downside, though. If a visitor finds what
he's looking for, and immediately leaves, it's hard to make money
off of him. Successful Internet sites must get people to visit
frequently and hang around _ the better to sell them things and
flash ads on their screens.
</P>
<P>
   It's called ``stickiness,'' and it's a crucial measurement of an
Internet company's success.
</P>
<P>
   In the stickiness sweepstakes, AOL's the one with the tube of
superglue. The company claims its 17 million users stay on the
service for an average of 55 minutes a day, far and away the best
performance in the industry. But remember that AOL, unlike almost
every other Net business, is more than a Web site. It's an Internet
service provider as well.
</P>
<P>
   Web companies that don't have their own on-line services need
other ways to build user loyalty. They're doing it by letting
visitors personalize the site. With special software, visitors to
Yahoo or Lycos can create their own custom Web page, with the
information and features that matter to them.
</P>
<P>
   Merchants like Amazon build up a database of information about
everything the visitor has ever purchased. Return to the site and
you're greeted by name, and told about new products and services
you might want to buy. ``In a physical store, you can't be all
things to all people,'' says Amazon's Risher. ``In mine, you can do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more notable are efforts by Web leaders to create on-line
communities, where visitors become participants in electronic
subcultures. Yahoo is spending $3.6 billion to buy the GeoCities
Web hosting site, where 3.5 million subscribers build personal Web
sites and maintain hundreds of communities appealing to a vast
range of tastes and interests. Lycos has done the same by acquiring
the Tripod and Angelfire Web hosting services.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most surprising community site is eBay. People come
to the Internet auction house in search of bargains, but thousands
stick around to chat. ``That is what eBay is based on,'' says Steve
Westly, the company's marketing chief. ``We are about changing
lives here.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, eBay is one of the stickiest sites on the Web.
According to the research firm Media Metrix Inc., eBay's 6.5
million users in February spent an average of two hours a month on
the site. That's far behind AOL, but vastly better than most Web
properties. By comparison, Amazon holds its average visitor for a
mere 12 minutes a month.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  Amazon is trying to find new ways to get visitors hooked.
Born as a bookstore, Amazon now sells recorded music, videos,
flowers and other gift items. In March the company launched a new
auction site to tap into eBay's market. Amazon even has a free
service for e-mailing electronic greeting cards. Risher says it's
just one more way to bring in visitors who might stay and shop.
</P>
<P>
   All the Web leaders figure that more is better, and they're
constantly adding new features. Search services like Yahoo, Lycos
and AOL's Web home page are now ``portals,'' with free e-mail and
Web page services, chat rooms, message boards _ anything that might
reel in more users.
</P>
<P>
   Not that this is a certain path to success. Yahoo's Mallett says
it's just too easy for Web firms to copy each others' innovations.
``We may have a 90-day advantage over some people . . . but that
would be a long time,'' he says. ``Most of the time, the next day,
AOL or Microsoft will pop up with a similar service.''
</P>
<P>
   But while flashy features may not give Web firms a lasting edge,
they do force competitors to play follow the leader. Fancy features
also screen out market newcomers. To take on a Yahoo or a AOL,
you've got to have at least as much to offer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  That was the daunting challenge that faced Lycos little more
than a year ago. One of the first search engines, it had become an
industry also-ran, its visitor count far behind Yahoo and AOL. Then
chief executive Davis got out his checkbook and bought several
major Web services, weaving them into a new Lycos Network.
</P>
<P>
   The push for eyeballs has paid off. Media Metrix recently found
that Lycos had edged past Yahoo in total visitors for the month of
March. ``I think what has proven to be the most challenging
issue,'' says Davis, ``is how to build and sustain a meaningful
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether an on-line company hopes to make money by selling goods
and services to consumers or advertising to businesses, the model
depends on drawing in millions of visitors.
</P>
<P>
   There's still a vast untapped Web audience in the United States,
where only about one-quarter of the population is regularly on
line. All the Web leaders are bombarding the masses with radio, TV
and print ads to tempt them to log on. But AOL is in the strongest
position to reach the unwired because it operates its own Internet
service, not just a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's Mallett says that in five years, half a billion people
will be on line. Most won't be American. No surprise then that
Yahoo and every other major Web company is making aggressive moves
overseas. Yahoo has 18 foreign subsidiaries providing custom Web
content in Europe, Asia and Latin America. AOL's purchase of the
struggling on-line service CompuServe has made it a major Internet
provider in Europe. Lycos has 10 foreign sites. Amazon's biggest
on-line bookstores are in Britain and Germany and eBay is running
on-line auctions in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   It's all about locking in dominant market position. AOL, backed
by billions in subscriber revenue, has already pulled it off. It's
the standard that the other Web-based companies aspire to.
</P>
<P>
   That's why even now the Yahoo people work in an anonymous
low-rise building with cheap gray plastic chairs, preferring to
pump every spare dime into efforts to dominate one of the world's
most competitive industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're running a business,'' says Mallett. ``Everything
matters. Every single hire matters. Every single light bulb
matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when you're already on top _ if you plan to stay there.

HARVARD STUDENTS PLUGGING INTO ON-LINE CAREERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEVEN WILMSEN   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Youssef Ghazal, like many of his fellow Harvard
Business School students, thought he wanted to become a consultant.
He wanted the six-figure starting salary, the prestige that comes
from advising giant corporations, and a career on what has been one
of the hot job tracks of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But then he took a trip to Silicon Valley last summer, and
everything changed. Sitting around a beer-stained pool table in an
abandoned San Francisco honky-tonk that now serves as offices for
WebMethods, an Internet start-up company hoping to go public soon,
Ghazal, 31, experienced a revelation he calls ``the turning
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, he realized that what he really wanted was a piece of
his own company. ``I realized it's not about the office you work
in, it's not about the salary. It's all about equity,'' The
Austrian native said of that moment.
</P>
<P>
   Ghazal ditched consulting and along with several other business
students is launching an on-line pharmacy in Europe. ``Those who
believe in the Internet will go far,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   So many of Ghazal's classmates have arrived at the same
conclusion that few are planning to follow traditional business
paths when they graduate. In a frenzy that professors compare to
the Great Oklahoma Land Rush, graduates are turning down lucrative
offers to stake claims in the burgeoning on-line world by trying to
start Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 343 Harvard Business School graduates out of a class
of 880 say they plan either to launch high-tech start-ups or join
the venture capital firms that support them to cash in on the
Internet boom, according to a student poll. That's triple the
number four years ago. Also, the number of graduates taking
traditional consulting and Wall Street jobs has dropped by nearly
half, to 308.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be all about consulting and investment banking at
Harvard,'' says John Borchers, a Harvard business student who
recently cochaired the school's business plan competition,
dominated by proposals for new Internet companies. ``Now,
everybody's got a business plan under their arm. They're passing up
the big salaries and the security for $40,000 a year and a few
stock options.''
</P>
<P>
   The shift has been so sudden and severe that some consulting
firms could not recruit enough business students this year and
turned to Harvard law students, says Kirstin Moss, the business
school's director of career services.
</P>
<P>
   Moss says that even Fortune 500 companies, longtime outposts for
Harvard students, are struggling to fill positions. One student's
recent comments, she says, summed up the obsession with the
Internet. ``A student said to me, `The gold rush is on, and it's
not going to last very long.' They want to get out there while the
opportunities are still available.''
</P>
<P>
   The same trend is evident at other prestigious business schools,
including MIT's Sloan School of Management, the Wharton School at
the University of Pennsylvania, and the Stanford Graduate School of
Business. But at Harvard, whose august reputation and wood-paneled
corridors for so long nurtured captains of industry and fed the
nation's corporations, the change has been particularly stark.
</P>
<P>
   Driving the sudden enthusiasm for Internet enterprises are the
almost incomprehensible sums of money being pumped into new on-line
companies. A recent survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that
venture capitalists rained $14.3 billion on start-ups last year,
almost all of them Internet-related.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley alone, a record 787 Internet ventures sprouted
in 1998, the report said. Each received about $5.8 million. In New
England, which had the second-largest concentration of Internet
start-ups, 407 new companies got a record $2 billion in venture
capital funding.
</P>
<P>
   With that kind of money, ``no brilliant idea should go wanting
for lack of funds,'' the report stated.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists who provide seed money to start-ups for a
piece of fledgling companies are ensuring that money is not a
problem. During recruiting season at Harvard, they invaded the
business school's Allston campus, handing out business cards to
students who one day might launch the next eBay or Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some fear that business students might be taking a big
gamble in passing up solid opportunities in corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about some of these kids,'' says Marco Iansiti, a
Harvard professor whose course on starting new ventures went from
an enrollment of 50 last year to 120 this year. ``There are some
who are going out there and doing very gutsy things. They're
turning down big offers and rolling the dice. It's a tougher world
out there than some of them think.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Harvard's hallways buzz with stories of recent
grads such as Stig Leschly, who two weeks ago sold his
seven-month-old start-up Exchange.com, an on-line seller of used
books and recordings, for a reported $200 million to Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the prospect of incredible sums of money, some say
students are motivated by a sense that the Internet represents a
vast frontier with unrivaled opportunities for making a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never been a time in contemporary history when there's
been a chance like this to leave your mark on the world,'' says
Anthony Tjan, a 1998 Harvard business graduate and cofounder of
Zefer, an Internet company specializing in business-to-business
communications. Last week, the company won $100 million in
financing from GTCR Golder Rauner LLC, a Chicago venture capital
firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industrial revolution produced Fords and Sloans,'' he
says. ``That's the opportunity we see in front of us now.''
</P>
<P>
   Such possibilities have inspired a near panic among student
entrepreneurs hoping to come up with the next big idea before
someone else does, students and professers say. In Harvard's annual
business plan contest, 80 student teams submitted entries for
companies they intend to launch this year, double the number in
1998. All but a few were ideas for Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   In the race to get started, many business students skipped
classes to make weekly pilgrimages to California and New York to
meet with potential investors. Some said they set up offices long
before they finished the spring semester.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many people getting in on this that you can work
on an idea for a year only to find somebody else is trying to do
the same thing,'' says one student who asked not to be named
because financing arrangements for his Internet start-up are at a
delicate stage. ``There's nothing worse than being a minute too
late.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also the ever-present fear that investor enthusiasm for
Internet companies, which has driven initial stock offerings to
astronomical heights, will suddenly go flat and pop the Internet
balloon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to know when the music is going to stop,''
says Mike Roberts, a senior lecturer and director of
entrepreneurial studies at Harvard. ``Very few of these companies
are making money. It's largely driven by the capital markets at
this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the last 50 Internet public offerings nationwide, only one
has fizzled. But last week, a San Diego on-line real estate firm,
Comps.com, made headlines when its initial public offering opened
at $15 a share but finished three-fourths of a point lower by the
end of the trading day. In a world where it has become common for
new Internet offerings to jump dozens of points in a single day, it
was an ominous sign.
</P>
<P>
   Even venture capitalists who have staked fortunes on the
Internet's ability to generate huge gains can't peer very far into
the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything could happen,'' says Klaus Koch, a 1997 Harvard
business graduate who works for the Los Angeles venture capital
firm Kleine, Hawkes &AMP; Co. ``I wouldn't be surprised if it goes on
for five years, and I wouldn't be surprised if it goes into the
toilet in three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   But student entrepreneurs at Harvard such as Jason Palmer, who
says he's close to securing financing for Mascotnetwork (``a sort
of America Online for college campuses''), are banking on the
Internet's long-term viability as a place to make their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunities are still endless,'' he says.

 &HT;    Wolfe was wrong; it is quite possible to go home again
 &HT;    By Jay Milner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ I think it was Tom Wolfe who said, ``You can't
go home again.'' That's not the Tom Wolfe who wrote ``The Right
Stuff'' and those other recent books, but the other one who wrote
those mammoth novels a generation or two ago.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe's declaration has been challenged many times in the
decades since he first came up with it. Some have agreed and some
haven't.
</P>
<P>
   I have just recently made a return trip to my old home town,
Lubbock, ``The Hub of the Plains and the Home of Texas'' and it was
indeed a trip. Make that A Trip!
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards I was somewhat dazzled by the experience. Felt a lot
like jet lag. I'm pretty sure I had fun, though.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing it was exhilarating to again, after more than 30
years, see how outrageously flat the country is out there on the
Texas High Plains. I remembered it being flat, of course, having
lived out there from babyhood until I went into the Navy to help
win WWII by teaching Waves how to swim at Waikiki Beach. But it is
flatter and the sky is bigger than I recalled. I love it!
</P>
<P>
   The occasion for this return to my home town was something
called ``Raising a Reader Book Festival'' put on by the Barnes and
Noble Bookstores and the Lubbock Area Coalition for Literacy. A
lady named Ann Boggs was the head honcho and did a marvelous job of
putting it together and keeping it rolling smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   I talked with some students at my old high school, the
magnificent Lubbock High School, built back when they really knew
how to build schools and the cost wasn't so high they could follow
through as they pleased, and at one of the ``new'' high schools
(meaning one built after I left town) Monterey High. Each session
was attended by students who were truly interested in books and
authors and such as that, and each session was an experience to be
remembered and cherished.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the real highlight: a book signing session at the
bookstore attended by several of my former teammates and classmates
at Lubbock High and their wives, children, and grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   That's when I started feeling the jet lag.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the first comment by my former football teammates was
along the lines of ``Put on a little weight there, haven't you,
hoss.'' No question mark at the end of that sentence, you see. It
was a statement of fact.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they had put on some heft as well, but not as much as
I had. I allowed as how I am on a strict diet now and going to the
gym at least twice a week and will soon again be looking like the
slender racing animal I once was.
</P>
<P>
   The tidings passed along by my old friends included both happy
and sad things. A couple of old friends had died I hadn't heard
about and one former teammate, a co-captain my senior year, was
reported to have Alzheimers. But the remarkable aspect of this old
friends session for me was the fact that those who were there
didn't appear to be all that different than they were way back
before the big war. There was a lot more grey hair, of course, and
reports of bad knees and such as that, but beneath it all they
looked and sounded astonishingly similar to the way they looked and
sounded way back when.
</P>
<P>
   As my friend Joe Murray has written, I grind out a new book
every 35 or so years. But after that return home to autograph my
latest one (''Confessions of a Maddog'', University of North Texas
Press) I've decided it won't be that long before I grind out
another one and get to go back home again.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
WebMD shifts gears, cancels plan for IPO 
By Michael E. Kanell  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ WebMD, one of the hottest Internet plays in Atlanta,
has for the second time pulled back from the brink of an initial
public offering of stock.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based company, which hopes to become the leading
site for health care information on the Net, filed a formal request
with the Securities and Exchange Commission to withdraw its
much-ballyhooed IPO.
</P>
<P>
   ``This request is made because the company has decided to pursue
a strategy that does not involve the offer and sale of its shares
to the public,'' wrote Jeffrey Arnold, WebMD chairman and chief
executive, in the SEC document, which was dated May 12.
``Therefore, the company has decided not to engage in an initial
public offering at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   An IPO had originally been slated for early May, then was
delayed before being shelved Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold was not available after filing the statement. Other
company officials, who have said nothing this week, said there
would be no comment beyond the written statement to the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   But rumors about the company have been swirling for weeks, and
the retreat from a lucrative IPO can only feed still more frantic
speculation. A similar, if less well-publicized, IPO filing last
summer was withdrawn when the market turned suddenly chilly. But
since then, the climate has reversed, and numerous Net-related
companies have soared in sometimes-delirious trading.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, WebMD launched its Internet business and chalked up a
series of deals with large players. WebMD registered for an IPO in
February, hoping to raise up to $55 million.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the launch seems to have been canceled _ or at least
postponed _ not for lack of likely investment but the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Bloomberg News reported that Microsoft had committed
to paying $300 million in exchange for 27 percent of WebMD. That
report was never confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, CNBC's David Faber reported Microsoft had
failed to strike a deal, but that continued talks indicated the
market value for the young company was climbing past the $2.5
billion mark.
</P>
<P>
   And where Microsoft is sniffing, other investors may not be far
behind.
</P>
<P>
   An IPO is typically a way for a young and unproven company to
trade control for cash, raising money that can bankroll operations
and expansion until its budding business takes off. An IPO also
lets early investors and executives turn at least some of their
shares into hefty checks.
</P>
<P>
   But WebMD, whose business by most accounts is not near
profitability, has already turned its promise into some cash. Most
impressively, the company announced a five-year, $220 million
investment by DuPont, which will hold two seats on the WebMD board.
</P>
<P>
   And if WebMD is poised for an injection anywhere in the
neighborhood north of $300 million, an IPO right now seems
unneeded. The early investors can surely get whatever payoff they
need, while the company grows. Assuming WebMD succeeds, it can bide
its time for a still more lucrative IPO in the future.
</P>
<P>
   As for the chances of success, there's no guarantee. But what
better indicators than an aggressive business plan, piles of cash
and the imprimatur of Microsoft?
</P>
<P>
   WebMD at first conceived a two-pronged strategy, going after
consumers to be sure, but expecting to make its money serving
doctors and other professionals who would be charged for various
services and special professionals-only information.
</P>
<P>
   But over the months, that strategy seems to have morphed until
the emphasis has seemingly come to rest on consumers who will
access the free side of the site. That shift to the consumers
expecting free access means advertising is key, and that means that
brand recognition matters.
</P>
<P>
   WebMD has deals with Lycos and CNN, as well as various providers
of health care information. Each deal adds content to the WebMD
site, each adding reasons that a Net surfer would visit
www.WebMD.com. And the more visits and the more eyes that ``drill
down'' into the site, the more WebMD can charge advertisers for
space.
</P>
<P>
   WebMD is not entering an empty field. Scores of entrepreneurs
have noticed that health care, which accounts for 14 percent of the
nation's $6 trillion-a-year economy, could be a monstrous market on
the Net as well. Hundreds of sites have emerged as competitors for
that market, but thus far, none is dominant.
</P>
<P>
   Among a slew of rivals are Atlanta companies like ADAM.com and
Medcast.
</P>
<P>
   Other contenders have some brand recognition of their own,
including sites of the Mayo Clinic and former Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop.

 &HT;    Double dutch the game, catching on quickly the aim
 &HT;    By Cara Ann
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Smack-dab in this month's issue of
``Teen People'' is a fashion spread starring Stan's Pepper
Steppers, the reigning world champs of double-dutch rope jumping.
</P>
<P>
   Bring down the old clothesline from grandma's attic. This sport
is cool.
</P>
<P>
   Double-dutch jumping, first popular in New York City, involves
two ropes twirling in opposite directions and one or two jumpers
doing tricks _ flips, rolls, push-ups, all without stopping.
</P>
<P>
   The sport's just catching on around here, again. Palm Beach
County used to send a team to the national tournament every year.
Then the elementary school teachers who organized teams moved on.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, one simply transferred. Felisa Miles wound up at Lake
Worth High, with no double-dutch team and the responsibility of
hosting last weekend's state tournament.
</P>
<P>
   She rustled up an old elementary student of hers _ Donald
Mundell, now 18 _ and two others who knew how to jump.
</P>
<P>
   They had months to prepare for the tournament. Pahokee Middle
School had just two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know the rules until Monday,'' says physical
education teacher Paula Yeater, who heard about the tournament and
organized students. They used flag football jerseys for uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Pahokee eighth-graders Joyetta Burgess, Brittney Godfrey and
Rochanna Geffare participated in speed-jumping, a two-minute
sprint-in-place measured by how many times a jumper's left foot
hits the floor.
</P>
<P>
   They jumped 35 times. More experienced teams from Broward County
jumped 265 and 285 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got another year before we get like this,'' says
Godfrey, watching the freestyle competition with its flips and
turns.
</P>
<P>
   But one young Palm Beach County team made it to nationals, after
just a year of jumping. Maggie Gonzalez and Meika and Brittany
Bodwell, third-graders with West Palm Beach Girl Scout Troop 14,
will compete in Hartford, Conn., in June.
</P>
<P>
   Troop sponsor Mary Dean thinks the school system should pick up
double-dutch as a competitive sport for girls, like softball.
</P>
<P>
   ``But people just don't know about it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Yet.

 &HT;    Spandex gives clothing comfort, flexibility
 &HT;    (EDS: Art available.)
 &HT;    By Christi Mays
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ S-T-R-E-T-C-H out and relax _ it's going to be a
fluid-fit, wrinkle-free, comfy-as-can-be summer.
</P>
<P>
   Stretchy spandex and Lycra fibers are showing up in trace
amounts in everything from clingy dresses to plus-size shirts and
from trousers to tailored jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, these fibers, which can stretch up to six times their
original length, were found mostly in workout wear, swimwear and
under garments.
</P>
<P>
   Now manufacturers are using them in all kinds of clothing. Knit
shirts and sweaters sport a bit of the stretchy fiber. Suits and
capris offer some flexibility, as do shorts and skirts. Most of
these stretchy clothes can be found in the juniors and plus-size
departments, while only a few items with spandex or Lycra can be
found in women's.
</P>
<P>
   ``These clothes can be in dressy or casual, depending on where
you're going,'' said Cassandra Rayson, department manager at Stein
Mart.
</P>
<P>
   Spandex is the generic term for elastane, man-made elastic
fibers. Lycra is a registered brand of spandex made only by DuPont,
which developed the fiber in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Spandex or Lycra can be combined with just about any other
fiber, including cotton, rayon, polyester, acrylic, acetate, etc. A
little bit of it goes a long way, too. Spandex or Lycra is usually
found in small portions in garments _ from 1 percent to 8 percent _
which doesn't change the appearance of the fabric, yet offers a
smooth, fluid-form silhouette.
</P>
<P>
   Garments with these fibers are very ``wearable'' and have a
bounce-back stretching quality so they retain their shape better,
even when stretched and washed repeatedly, said Linda Dizmon, sales
manager for women's apparel at Sears.
</P>
<P>
   They also offer a lot of support and can help ``hold things in''
or smooth things out, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Probably spandex and Lycra's greatest attribute is the comfort
it offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in pants and things, to have that little bit of spandex
makes it so much more comfortable because it moves with you and
breaths with you,'' Dizmon said. ``It also helps the clothes kind
of keep their shape better.''
</P>
<P>
   Teens and college-age shoppers go crazy for anything with
spandex in it, Rayson reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of it you really have to have the body for the little
skirts,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But just because a clothing item has spandex in it doesn't mean
the garment has to fit tightly or is ``clingy,'' says Millisa
Herring, co-manager of Lane Bryant, which sells women's sizes 14
through 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of our items do have some type of spandex in them
to allow for stretch and comfort so it's not too tight,'' she said.
``About 75 percent of the capri pants we sell have stretch in them,
as well as the elbow-sleeve stretch shirts. That allows for a
little bit more freedom of movement and comfort.''
</P>
<P>
   Store managers say they definitely have seen an increase in the
number of clothing items that contain spandex. Even though some of
this spring's clothing items are trendy, they said they don't see
the idea of adding spandex to clothes as a soon-to-fade fad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's something that will continue,'' Herring said.
</P>
<P>
   Dizmon sees the addition of spandex to clothing as a lifestyle
demand.
</P>
<P>
   Lifestyles are geared toward comfort and casual living now, she
said. ``But then people still want to look cute. To buy something
on sale that is cute and comfortable, that's the absolute
superlative to be able to get all that. I think that's a lot of
what the spandex offers.''
</P>
<P>
   Allyson McKee, 15, said she has a closet full of items that
contain either spandex or Lycra _ dresses, skirts, shirts and
pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels really good,'' she said as she sorted through some of
the stretchy styles at Sears. ``They're really comfortable to wear
to school and really cute and in style.''
</P>
<P>
   Clothing items with Lycra or spandex may require some special
attention when washing. Here are some of the fabric-care tips
listed on the DuPont Web site at www.dupont.com/lycra/facts
/care.0.html:
</P>
<P>
   _ Never use chlorine bleach on garments with Lycra. Bleach can
cause discoloration, growth and eventual breakage of Lycra.
All-fabric, nonchlorine bleach can be used for laundering Lycra
garments and may actually be beneficial in preventing graying.
</P>
<P>
   _ If the garment tags recommend washing and tumble drying, it's
probably for a good reason. The heat generated by the drier will
help recover any lost stretch that occurred while wearing the
garment and thorough washing, rinsing and drying in machines will
bring out the best in Lycra.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dry cleaning Lycra is no problem.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most fiber combinations can be cleaned by following simple
guidelines (listed on the clothing's tag). When mixed with cotton,
nylon, polyester or acrylic, Lycra can be hand or machine washed
and tumble or line dried.
</P>
<P>
   When mixed with rayon, silk, acetate or tri-acetate, fabrics
with Lycra should only be dry cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   _ When in doubt about the care of a fabric, always follow label
instructions.

 &HT;    KITCHEN GARDENS: Books may plant seeds of inspiration
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It's positively absolutely safe!
</P>
<P>
   Those who record such details remind us that as of last weekend,
it's OK to plant anything in the garden without fear of frost.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to rush right in, troweling in the tomatoes and basil,
and planting the beans. But if you're putting down the same old
crops in the same old place, this may be the time for a new
approach to the kitchen garden.
</P>
<P>
   A crop of new books provides inspiration that may motivate you
to pencil in a new plan, or just curl up on the porch and think
about it.
</P>
<P>
   Start with ``Country Home's new Kitchen Garden Planner''
(Meridith, $34.95), which offers plan sketches and gorgeous, though
somewhat repetitious, photos of herbs and their life-size flowers.
The book records plans of 13 gardens in various parts of the
country, and all are dedicated to a decorous kitchen garden. While
long on herbs, the plans also focus on vegetable gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Getting organized also is the focus of ``Country Living
Gardener: A Garden of Recipes'' (Hearst, $24.95). It's written and
illustrated with watercolors and pen-and-ink drawings by Cynthia
Gibson, who calls the book ``my personal approach to combining the
arts of gardening and cooking.'' Chapter headings bring the two
together in themes such as ``The Soup Garden,'' ``The Salad
Garden'' and ``The Edible Flower Garden.'' Chapters cover both the
growing and using of the edibles.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes Ronni Lundy with another approach in her ``Butter
Beans to Blackberries: Recipes from the Southern Garden'' (North
Point, $30). This is not really about the growing of the beans and
berries, but rather about enjoying the harvest of what she calls
``the whole garden of treasures that every Southerner remembers and
loves.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the ribs, fried chicken and biscuits usually
associated with the Southern table, it is the fruits and vegetables
that captured the author's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Lundy, who lives in Louisville, came to national attention with
her first book, ``Shuck Beans, Stack Cakes and Honest Fried
Chicken.'' Her second, ``The Festive Table,'' wandered too far from
her roots, but now she is back home in territory as comfortable as
a pair of garden clogs.
</P>
<P>
   Lundy is passionate about all the foods of the South, but in
particular those harvested from the fields, and the book and
recipes are laced with the recollections of where and when she ate
them, starting in her mountain home of Corbin, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   For Southern expatriates, the book may be a trip down memory
lane, even if they never step from the back porch to the garden.
The rest of us may just make our first acquaintance with lady cream
peas and ``greasy'' beans.

WHEN PARENTS NEED ANSWERS, THEY TURN TO NETMOM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The other night, I found myself in a chat room on America
Online, waiting for Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine to get
to the point. Along with Hillary Rosen, president of the Recording
Industry Association of America, Morello was on-line to discuss
violent music in the aftermath of the shootings in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of addressing the subject, Morello began with a
screed about the war in the Balkans and got on a soap box about
politicians decrying violent lyrics while NATO engages in a bloody
bombing campaign. Morello certainly wasn't the first to make that
connection, but the thing was, nobody in the chat room was there to
discuss it. Most of the teen-agers just wanted to type love letters
to Morello, but some of the parents on-line had genuine concerns.
What, if anything, should they be doing to monitor their kids'
exposure to pop culture? And what about the Internet? How do you
ensure kids' safety on-line without hindering their exposure to its
enormous potential?
</P>
<P>
   Forget the chat room: All you got there was ``Blah, blah, blah,
Yugoslavia,'' ``Blah, blah, blah, President Clinton,'' and ``Blah,
blah, blah, Tom Morello is God.'' I gave up and zapped off an
e-mail to NetMom, an expert in youth culture on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Parents are concerned, NetMom replied. She's seen a dramatic
increase in hits to her informative site (www.NetMom.com) since the
Littleton tragedy. ``Kids are more savvy about the Internet than
their parents are,'' says NetMom, aka Jean Armour Polly, a former
librarian and author of ``The Internet Kids and Family Yellow
Pages.'' ``But that doesn't mean parents should go off the deep end
and pull the plug. They should investigate it. If you don't have it
at home, go to a cyber cafe or the public library. See what's out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Polly is an Internet pioneer and something of a Net evangelist
(she coined the term ``surfing the Net''), and she's not about to
offer alarmist views about cyberspace. ``There are dangers out
there, but outweighing those dangers is the wonder of the Internet
and the fabulous sites created for and by kids. The educational
benefits are so rich, and I'd hate to see parents scared off
because of stories saying that the Internet is evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely. Polly urges parents to allow the Internet into their
homes on their own terms. And she offers some sensible advice on
how to do just that. The first thing, of course, involves
old-fashioned, non-technical communication. ``People don't talk to
their kids,'' she says. ``You can have someone on-line talking in a
chat room about how to be a better parent while their own kid is on
the floor behind them. It's so funny. You can reach across the
globe in a chat room, but why can't you reach out to your own
kids?''
</P>
<P>
   That's lesson number one. But what about that eerie feeling that
your kids are one click ahead of you out there in cyberspace? Here
are NetMom's suggestions. Some parents opt to filter the Internet
in a variety of ways. First, some Internet service providers filter
certain content for children; these providers can be found by
checking out http://thelist.internet.com; do a search on
``filtered.'' AOL, for instance, offers its members a parental
control option.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the filtering software packages, which have been
controversial since they came on the market. First Amendment
activists are against them as a general rule, especially in public
libraries. But even the staunchest free speech advocates would
admit that people can make their own choices about what content
comes into their homes. These packages, which include products like
CyberSitter and SmartFilter, allow parents to block pages that
contain pornography and hate speech. When they were first
introduced, they were creaky, blocking sites that might have a
chicken breast recipe or a discussion of breast cancer. They've
gotten better, though, and the question ``To filter or not to
filter'' is a personal choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have filters in our house,'' Polly says. ``Son of
NetMom (Stephen) is almost 13, and we do a lot of talking about
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Son of NetMom, of course, is pretty adept on-line. And his
mother can tell you about plenty of places where kids can learn
on-line in a safe environment. She raves about some of the search
engines designed specifically for children. The popular Ask Jeeves
site, for instance, has a site designed for youngsters called Ask
Jeeves for Kids (www.ajkids.com). Polly also recommends
www.yahooligans.com and Kids Click, a site created by librarians
(http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/kidsclick!/).
</P>
<P>
   The point is, you don't have to be powerless and you don't have
to turn to chats with rock stars to figure out what to do. Danger
may be only one click away in cyberspace, but so is a wealth of
educational experiences. Just ask NetMom. She knows.

----- &QC;  Liesl Clark didn't expect to be deluged with media requests
when she ascended Mount Everest to film a PBS Nova documentary. But
early this week, the team of climbers discovered the body of George
Mallory, the British adventurer who disappeared on Everest back in
1924. Word travels fast in these days of instant communication,
especially when you're chronicling your adventures on a Web site
(www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/everest/).
</P>
<P>
   ``While we were waiting at Base Camp, the climbers used their
satellite phone and laptop to announce the news to the world,''
Clark wrote in an e-mail to this column. ``Instantly, the whole
world knew... Somehow, Web-casting has taken the world by storm,
and anyone can post news, without understanding the repercussions.
While the outside world feasted on the breaking news, we were
holding on at Base Camp for the team to return, still very much in
the dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we deluged with media requests? Just about every major
magazine and newspaper has been in touch with us, asking for photos
of Mallory and doing interviews. I just got off the satellite phone
with the Sunday Times in London. I'm not so sure the media would be
quite so anxious to speak with us if we were in Boston. I can only
tell you that when I call a reporter and say, `This is Liesl Clark
calling from Everest Base Camp,' they, amazingly, don't put me on
hold.''

 &HT;    Luyendyk drives towards retirement
 &HT;    By Dave Lance
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Through the years, it wasn't so unusual to see
Arie Luyendyk signing autographs. After all, he's a two-time
Indianapolis 500 winner.
</P>
<P>
   But Luyendyk had never been approached for his signature by a
fellow driver until 1998 Indy 500 Rookie of the Year Steve Knapp
asked him to sign his driving uniform last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I thought he was kidding, but he was serious,''
Luyendyk said. ``That was a first for me. I've signed underwear
(this week), bras and some flesh.''
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk's writing hand is in overdrive because fans realize the
end is near for a racing legend. Late last year, Luyendyk announced
the Indianapolis 500 on May 30 would be his last open-wheel race.
It has led to a wave of well-wishing and reminiscing from fans,
sponsors and drivers.
</P>
<P>
   And it's made for a sentimental week for Luyendyk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure if I'm going to totally retire,'' Luyendyk said.
``It's going to be tough, because I want to be in a race car. But I
want to spend time with my family and do other things that life has
to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   But before he does that, in honor of his last Indy run there's
been public appearances, charity events and press conferences. In
between, the 45-year-old Holland native has found time to practice
at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, although practice was shortened
Tuesday because of rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I'm busier and there's been more requests for
interviews,'' Luyendyk said. ``I realize what this is all about,
but I also realize I'll be here in the future, probably still
working with Team Treadway and other sponsors we have.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I might broadcast next year. I live in the States
(Scottsdale, Ariz.) and I'm not moving anywhere else. So I'll be
around.''
</P>
<P>
   That Luyendyk will stay in racing comes as good news to the fans
who have followed his career as a Dutch Formula Vee series driver
in 1972 to the Indianapolis 500's all-time prize-money leader with
$5.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   But it's more than his prize money that's made Luyendyk a
favorite in the racing community. It's his class, on the track and
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the two years I raced in America, I found Arie to be a
gentleman as well as a very professional driver,'' said Nigel
Mansell, who finished third in the 1993 Indy 500. ``When I did my
last race for the Newman/Haas team at Laguna Seca, Arie came by our
motorhome . . . to say goodbye and wish us well.
</P>
<P>
   ``That showed he is a true sportsman, and I'm certain that's one
reason why the public has been supportive of him throughout his
career.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the support stems from Luyendyk's success at Indy. He won
the race in 1990 and 1997, set the 500-mile average speed record
(185.981 mph) in 1990 and the one-lap qualifying mark (237.498) in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Said Indianapolis Motor Speedway president Tony George, ``I
think it's safe to say when his name comes up on the ballot for
induction into the Hall of Fame, he will most likely be elected on
the first ballot.''
</P>
<P>
   But will he be inducted as a two-time Indy champion or three?
Luyendyk likes his chances of winning the race, especially after
finishing with the fourth-highest speed on Monday (221.119).
</P>
<P>
   ``Things happen here you can't foresee,'' Luyendyk said. ``You
hope your car handles good and you stay close to the lead. If you
stay close at lap 150 or 160, you have a shot at winning this race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put it this way, I'm not counting on (winning), but we're
working on it.''
</P>
<P>
   When Luyendyk is finished with the 500, he said he'll spend more
time with his son, Arie Jr., lending monetary support to the
Formula Ford 1600 class racer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stay away and just try to get the money,'' Luyendyk said.
``I try not to be an overbearing dad. I'd like to see him here, but
now we want him to get the experience of all kinds of race
tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like his dad did.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Bubba-Wan Kenobi, with Litesaber
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ There's been so much talk about this new ``Star
Wars'' prequel coming out that I figured I should jump into the
game. Here's what ``Star Wars'' would be like if it had been shot
in South Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of fighting with lightsabers, the Jedi Knights would use
pool cues.
</P>
<P>
   The mantra would change from ``May the Force be with you'' to
``Let's you and me kick some space butt.''
</P>
<P>
   Darth Vader would admit he got the idea for the black clothing
from Johnny Cash.
</P>
<P>
   There would be several scenes in which Darth Vader gets beer all
over his mask from trying to drink through the hole.
</P>
<P>
   And he wouldn't be called Darth Vader. He would be called Garth
Vader.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Alec Guinness, Obi-Wan Kenobi would be played by Burt
Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often, Yoda would say, ``I know what. Let's barbecue
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Every so often, somebody would tell Yoda, ``Hey, rubber face,
why don't you just shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   Those airborne Harleys the Ewoks stole and rode around on
through the trees would have Miller Lite, Pennzoil and Red Man
decals on them.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of ``a long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away''
it would read, ``somewheres back in there down toward Kyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Luke Skywalker, his name would have been Duke
Skywalker.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody would get a welding torch out of the truck and turn
R2-D2 into a keg.
</P>
<P>
   In the bar scene, a couple of the characters would use the Force
to cheat at shuffleboard, run up a large tab or get somebody else
to put money in the jukebox.
</P>
<P>
   There would be at least one scene where Stone Cold Steve Austin
hits Darth Vader over the head with a folding chair.
</P>
<P>
   Jabba the Hutt, the big, fat bad guy, would have been a used car
salesman called Jabba the Regular at Hut's. In the plot line, it
would be explained that he turned himself into a load from eating
too many double-meat cheeseburgers.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody would get a welding torch out of the truck and turn
C-3PO into a still.
</P>
<P>
   In the bar scene, a couple of the characters would have used the
Force to get the bartender to buy everybody a round, keep the place
open past closing time and get Queen Amidala from the prequel to
enter the wet T-shirt contest.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of almost falling in love, Luke Skywalker and his sister
Princess Leia would have gotten hitched, moved out to a
manufactured home off Nuckols Crossing Road and raised three
children named Li'l Bit, Scooter and String Bean. And the Austin
Independent School District wouldn't be able to find them on their
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Princess Leia. The lead female interest would have been
Miss Bud Light.
</P>
<P>
   Chewbacca would have been called Manchaca, and of course his
name would have been pronounced Manchak.
</P>
<P>
   The wisecracking and flirtatious Han Solo would have been known
by all the gals as ``Hands'' Solo.
</P>
<P>
   Han Solo would have a ``Stop Honking, I'm Reloading'' bumper
sticker on the fender of his Millennium Falcon and a pair of fuzzy
dice hanging from the rear view mirror.
</P>
<P>
   There would be at least one scene with Han Solo on a creeper
under the Millennium Falcon changing out the oil.

 &HT;    Manic moms: Lazy days loom _ but first, there's a frantic end of
school frenzy
 &HT;    (With illustration.)
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Lee
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Summertime, and the living is easy? Not for parents.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Christmas, there's no time of the year that keeps
families more frantic than May and June. School is wrapping up,
clubs are winding down and summer activities are beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like you get into May and everything goes into
overdrive,'' says Melanie Payne, 39. ``I've got two kidsd with my
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Fussell, owner of the home-organizing service Clutter
Coach, recommends keeping a weekly calendar on the refrigerator as
a reminder of family activities and responsibilities. Running
errands such as grocery shopping without children in tow can save
time, too, says Fussell, the mother of an 8-year-old and leader of
a Cub Scout troop.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the flip side of the coin. Kelly Burke, a high
school physics teacher, has her share of end-of-the-school-year
pressures _ finishing the curriculum, scheduling around a series of
special events. Katie, 6, is wrapping up Girl Scouts for the year,
and baseball season ends in late May for Adam, 7.
</P>
<P>
   But for Burke, there is an end in sight. Like her kids, she gets
a summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I pick them up at school now, the first two questions are
`How was your behavior at school?' and `Do you have any homework
tonight?' '' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in the summertime we wake up and say, `Shall we go
swimming today or play golf? Do you want to go to the aquarium in
Tennessee or Callaway Gardens?' It's fun.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Former orphan returns home to help others
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service DAYTON, Ohio _ The last thing Roy
<TEXT>
Sturgill wanted to do is to come back to Dayton. Too many toxic
memories.
<P>
   Progress is forward motion, after all, not backward. The only
way to prove you've transcended your past is to travel light-years
away from it.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why Sturgill's young clients at Montgomery County
Children Services have such a hard time buying his story. They find
it hard to believe their caseworker once lived at the orphanage at
Shawen Acres. Hard to believe he would came back on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think every caseworker is trained to give out the same
story _ about how they made it, and you can make it too,'' Sturgill
says with a wry smile.
</P>
<P>
   Disbelief aside, Sturgill, 43, has found that his past helps him
understand his clients, both children and parents. And working with
children on the very grounds where, a troubled adolescent, he once
lived, has exorcised some of his demons. ``I get a lot of memories,
walking around,'' Sturgill says.
</P>
<P>
   The memories, up to the day in '70 when he came to Shawen Acres,
are mostly bad. His mother married at 15 and had three children by
the time Roy came along. Overwhelmed, she sent the baby to live
with a great-aunt until he was 4 years old.
</P>
<P>
   When he came home, his parents were virtual strangers to him.
``My parents were constantly arguing,'' Sturgill recalls. ``I
thought they were arguing mainly because I was back. I carried that
blame for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   His parents divorced shortly after Roy rejoined the family. His
mother contracted multiple sclerosis, and his father, an alcoholic,
had little to do with the family. When he was 14, his mother was
put in a nursing home. The children were told that none of their
family members could take care of them, and they went to live at
Shawen Acres.
</P>
<P>
   That stung. But after years of neglect and abuse, the orphanage
was a relief. A caseworker took them shopping for shoes and
clothes. ``It was the first time we'd had anybody invest that kind
of money in us,'' Sturgill says. ``It was nice to be able to go to
school and wear new clothes and shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   School was another matter. By ninth grade, Sturgill had a spotty
attendance record. His Shawen Acres caseworker informed him, ``Not
going to school is not an option.''
</P>
<P>
   Sturgill lived in Cottage 5 with 18 other boys from different
cultures and backgrounds, who came together as a family. For the
first time, he learned discipline through consequences, not fists
and broom handles. ``I had to make choices, with my choices
resulting in good or bad consequences,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the great-aunt who had raised him his first four
years sent for Sturgill. After graduating from high school, he
joined the Navy, well-prepared by the discipline and camaraderie of
life at Shawen Acres.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, he tried to bury his past. It surprised him when he
cried at the funeraln a whole lot quicker. I have the benefit of
having been that teen-ager.''
</P>
<P>
   He can talk to children about forgiveness: ``I try to tell them,
'Look, I know your parents have done bad things to you, and you're
angry and upset. But eventually, if you both live long enough,
you'll forgive them _ or you should.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sturgill also believes no case is hopeless: ``With the right
intervention, you can take almost any situation that involves
children, and turn that around and improve their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   At first apprehensive, Sturgill now says, ``Kicking me off the
property is the only way I'll go out.'' He bought a home less than
a mile from his office.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, how he found his calling at the place where he started
out. Day by day, he strives to redeem childhoods at the place that
redeemed his.
</P>
<P>
   You can move forward, after all, by going back.

MAKING THE WEB ACCESSIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's much to be said for being a titan of industry. There's
the money, the corporate jet and the private island. But there's
also the power to bend others to your will.
</P>
<P>
   That could mean crushing a few labor unions or stamping out some
annoying government regulation. Or it could mean the kind of
far-sighted move that IBM Corp. recently made. IBM said it would
stop advertising on any Web site that didn't pledge to respect
visitors' privacy. ``Our objective is not to cancel advertising,''
said IBM spokesman John Bukovinsky, ``but to get people to
comply.'' And comply they shall, if they want a slice of IBM's
$60-million Web advertising budget.
</P>
<P>
   It's a classic case of a big, powerful mega-corporation throwing
its weight around in exactly the right way. At a single stroke, IBM
gave every major Web site an incentive to do what they should all
be doing anyway--looking out for the privacy of Internet users.
It's good business for IBM to reach out to Internet-shy customers
fretful about losing privacy. But it also comes across as a noble
deed.
</P>
<P>
   But if I were IBM CEO Lou Gerstner, I'd follow up the privacy
triumph with an even more daring act of enlightened self-interest.
I'd tell my Web advertising partners that in a year's time I'd stop
doing business with them unless their Web sites were redesigned so
that blind people can use them.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is known as ``universal Web accessibility,'' and
even many Web savvy readers are probably ignorant of it. Those who
encounter the idea often respond with derision. The Internet, they
figure, is an inherently visual medium. Designing Web pages for
blind people makes as much sense as designing sports cars for them.
</P>
<P>
   Not so. Web sites can be designed to work with computer
technologies long used by blind people, such as software that will
read electronic text aloud. But to reliably use these technologies,
the Web site must follow some basic principles of accessible
design.
</P>
<P>
   There's no excuse for not knowing the principles. The World Wide
Web Consortium in Cambridge, the international body that sets
standards for the Web, released a set of accessibility guidelines
last week. They list a number of relatively simple steps to ensure
disabled visitors can make use of the site.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these steps aren't just good for blind people; they make
sense on general principle. For instance, if you attach text tags
to all pictures on a site, a blind user's screen-reader program
will tell him what he's missing. But the same tag also flashes on
the screen, so it's useful as a caption for sighted Web surfers.
Ever notice how a department store's wheelchair entrance is the
easiest one to use? In the same way, adding accessibility to a Web
site makes it a friendlier place for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Complying with the accessibility standards is well within the
ability of professional Web designers. There's even a Web site
called Bobby, created by the Center for Applied Special Technology
in Peabody, that'll test the site. To Bobby-test some of your
favorite sites, go to www.cast.org/bobby.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, major Web sites may have no choice but to become
accessible. There's a running argument about whether the federal
Americans with Disabilities Act requires businesses and government
agencies to make their sites universally accessible. So far, the
courts have offered no guidance. But it's not unthinkable that the
same law that requires wheelchair ramps will soon be interpreted to
require universal Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   I share an entrepreneur's distaste for government intervention,
even in a good cause, but I'd set that instinct aside for the good
of 8.5 million Americans with serious visual impairments.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, why should the government bully Web designers into
doing the right thing, when IBM can do it instead? Let them
threaten to pull their ads from sites that neglect the disabled.
Perhaps Microsoft will join in -- those guys love to twist arms.
Maybe even the resurgent Apple Computer Inc. might issue such a
threat. It's been awhile since Apple has been strong enough to push
people around. Here's a chance for them to get back into the habit.

 &HT;    Installment 9: Ron Wiggins' midlife journey to Mount McKinley
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few ways to tell you're in the Midwest:
</P>
<P>
   _ Fewer Mercedes and Volvos, more John Deere tractors. A lot
more.
</P>
<P>
   _ Business signs tend to be perky. ``If you can't stop, smile as
you go by.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Rampant Bambicide. It's almost as if deer say, ``I came
through a long, cold winter in good shape, so now that it's spring,
I think I'll throw myself in front of a truck.''
</P>
<P>
   _ When you forget to move your slow vehicle into the right lane,
Midwestern drivers seem to take the attitude that inconsiderate
nitwits are God's creatures, too. Not once, when I forgot, did
Midwestern drivers lean on their horns or offer me instructive
gestures.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask for directions and you not only get directions, but you
are required to repeat them back, and then your foster angel waits
to see that you're going the right way.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coffee is 25 cents at gas marts. When I remarked on the price,
I got my only frown from an Iowan who said a trifle defensively,
``A quarter's a fair price for a cup of coffee.''

   ALLIANCE, Neb. _ As I drove to see ``Carhenge'' in Alliance,
Neb., I kept saying to myself: ``There has to be more to this than
I've been told.''
</P>
<P>
   A colleague told me what I'd see: ``It's unbelievable. You go
into this field off town and this farmer's got a bunch of cars set
up exactly like those mysterious stone formations at Stonehenge in
England.''
</P>
<P>
   Carhenge? Druid farmers in Nebraska?
</P>
<P>
   ``Trust me, you've got to see this.''
</P>
<P>
   When helpful reader Marsha Baker of West Palm Beach, Fla.
recommended Carhenge as well, I marked it on my map.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Stonehenge, except with cars,'' I kept saying to myself
as I drove west, making a slow go of it in a sustained headwind of
30 mph that held Max, my Toyota-powered RV, to 50 mph.
</P>
<P>
   I wondered how Max would fare if the winds sustained through the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   They sustained, and Max hated it. I never got the game little RV
up to 50 all the way to Alliance, often kicking into second gear
just to maintain headway.
</P>
<P>
   On the bright side, I was able to appreciate the rolling
Nebraska countryside pretty much at my leisure. And the country was
so beautiful in its rise and fall that I wondered why Rodgers and
Hammerstein didn't simply go with Nebraska!
</P>
<P>
   And then I understood. Oklahoma _ four syllables. Nebraska _
three. How are you going to sing Nebraska, without making it
``Nebraskaka,'' which I don't think the citizens of Nebraska would
appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the musings of the newcomer struck by the blue-skied,
golden beauty of the country, the cloudless storms notwithstanding.
Would I ever get to Alliance bucking these headwinds? And if not,
who would help me? I drove hours without a car or truck passing me.
</P>
<P>
   I got my answer up the road at Red's Cafe in Mullen, Neb. _
population 728. Nebraskans, when they're spread thin, look out for
the other fellow as Sam Simonson demonstrated when he came over to
my table to refill my coffee.
</P>
<P>
   No, Simonson was not my waiter. Coffee is self-serve in these
parts and when you're helping yourself, you come around to the
other tables and top off cups. Simonson was a rancher, I was to
learn, and a fit, fiftyish man with crinkly blue eyes.
</P>
<P>
   I thanked him and, thinking a compliment was in order, said
``Your Sand Hills countryside reminds me of the British Open.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what Ben Crenshaw thought,'' smiled Simonson. ``South
of here a ways, he built Sand Hills Golf Club, fixing it up to look
like one of those British courses. He flies in folks to North
Platte and they shuttle 'em to the golf course. Celebrities like
it. The Gatlin Brothers and Glen Campbell come out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Before that, Ted Turner came in with a buffalo ranch. Now land
is up to $250 an acre, a shocker to folks around here. ``Six or
seven years ago it was $60 and $70 an acre.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell him about how we rate in the nation,'' said the man
behind the counter who was Bill Neumeyer, the manager. He pointed
to a yellowing Associated Press clipping rating Hooker County as
the 13th least populated county in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got 2,700 people in the whole county,'' Simonson said.
``You got to go 100 miles one way and 75 miles another to reach a
town of any size. Where you going?''
</P>
<P>
   ``To Alliance. To see Carhenge,'' I said. ``Have you seen it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' the rancher said evenly. ``Just some cars stuck in the
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Post Script: Yes, by golly, that is exactly what Carhenge is,
some cars stuck in the ground, replicating the work of ancient
Druids who, having no access to junked Cadillacs and Fords, made do
with slabs of granite. I went, I saw, I bought post cards. As to
why anyone would bother, there was only this explanation at the
``attraction:''
</P>
<P>
   ``(Carhenge) was conceived by Jim Reinders who once lived on
this farm. Constructed during a family reunion, it was dedicated on
the summer solstice of 1987.''
</P>
<P>
   As to ``why,'' the artist declines comment, saying ``PLANE LOQUI
DEPREHENDI''
</P>
<P>
   Which loosely translates to ``If you have a flat place, do
something with it.''
</P>
<P>
   I left a half dollar donation in a lock box, saddled up Max, and
headed for the Colorado Springs gold country.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Do I worry? Yeah, but fears can't stifle joy
 &HT;    By Emily Minor
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ We parents today are struggling with a
set of worries so different from the worries of our past that it's
hard to know whether we should forge ahead, heads high, or build
ourselves a bunker.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose the answer lies somewhere in the middle. But that
middle is often so obscured by the news of bomb scares at our
proms, guns in our schools, hungry children in our midst that
sometimes we can't help but embrace all the fear, real or not.
</P>
<P>
   I started thinking about this, really thinking about it, Monday
when I was in the car, alone. There was a Columbine story on NPR,
then a car pulled up next to me and the guy in it stared at me and
made me feel so uncomfortable, so unnerved, that my heart thumped
wildly and my adrenaline fed my imagination.
</P>
<P>
   (ITAL)My God,(END ITAL) I thought, (ITALAL)what(END ITAL) is
keeping you awake? Sleeplessness is sleeplessness. Fear is fear.
</P>
<P>
   Worrying is worrying.
</P>
<P>
   Except lately. Lately we're all so skittish about the most
regular of things. School days. Prom nights. Even strangers at a
stoplight.
</P>
<P>
   So far, I've had to offer only cursory explanations of Columbine
and death by tornadoes and bomb scares to my 8-year-old, which is
good. I can barely comprehend it all myself. Except to say that,
whatever we do, however we fight what's happening around us, we
can't let ourselves be crippled by things we cannot control.
</P>
<P>
   We can't let the fear steal our joy.
</P>

   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

<P>
   Q: What authority does Hillary Rodham Clinton have to run around
the world giving $20 million to whomever she wishes?
</P>
<P>
   A: This subject has come up before. The $21 million in aid funds
wasn't ``given'' by Clinton. She merely announced it during her
visit to Macedonia to meet with refugees and talk to international
aid workers. Designed to support ethnic Albanians who were forced
from Kosovo, and the Macedonian people who have taken them in, the
money was part of an aid package approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What can you tell me about Project Adventure? I understand
that it operates homes for troubled youths.
</P>
<P>
   A: Described as an intervention program for those who are
``socially maladjusted,'' Project Adventure has as its premise the
concept that outdoor settings and adventure-based activities will
increase the students' enthusiasm and willingness to pay attention.
Based in Hamilton, Mass., it has four U.S. offices and a number of
workshop sites nationwide, and is expanding with outreaches in
Asia, Australia and New Zealand, and a worldwide network of
educators.
</P>
<P>
   If you're online, check www.pa.org for general information about
Project Adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported that an expedition found a body on Mount
Everest that may be a man who reached the summit 29 years before
Sir Edmund Hillary. Do you have any details? Is Hillary still
alive? If so, what was his reaction?
</P>
<P>
   A: The reported discovery of the remains of British climber
George Mallory, who died on Mount Everest in 1924, has reopened a
debate on who was first to climb the world's highest mountain.
History books have credited Hillary and his guide, Tenzing Norgay,
for accomplishing the feat in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Expedition members found the body they believe to be Mallory's
on May 1 near the top of Everest, but they haven't been able to
prove that he reached the summit before falling to his death.
Mallory and his companion, Andrew Irvine, were last seen on June 8,
1924.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary indeed is still living. In Auckland, New Zealand, the
80-year-old explorer said he believed an ascent of Mount Everest
could only be described as a success if the climber returned alive.
``Despite that, it was a very remarkable effort by Mallory (and
Irvine) even to get as high as they did, and we don't know where
that was.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read a short article on an Alabama jury awarding $581
million to a family that claimed to have been overcharged for two
satellite dishes. There were no particulars about the case. What
was the big deal?
</P>
<P>
   A: The case involved finance charges by Whirlpool Financial
National Bank, a former subsidiary of Whirlpool Corp. now owned by
TransAmerica Bank. As reported by the Birmingham News, Barbara
Carlisle and her parents, George and Velma Merriweather of
Greensboro, Ala., bought two satellite dishes and financed $1,124
at an interest rate of 21.9 percent. They said they were told the
deal involved payments of $34 a month for three years, when in fact
the term was for four years and four months.
</P>
<P>
   Carlisle and the Merriweathers said the longer term caused them
to be overcharged $612. By paying on the contract for 4 1/2 years,
their attorney said, they were being charged 300 percent interest.
Their lawsuit alleged that Whirlpool targeted ``uneducated and
illiterate people.''
</P>
<P>
   A Hale County jury awarded $975,000 in compensatory damages and
$580 million in punitive damages. ``The jury sent a message that
they will not tolerate companies' going into people's homes and
robbing and stealing from them this way,'' said Tom Methvin of
Montgomery, one of the plaintiff's attorneys. He added that the
trial judge can reduce the verdict and the Alabama Supreme Court
can reduce it even further.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I send an e-mail comment about the NATO campaign in
Yugoslavia to President Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   A: Address your message to president(at)whitehouse.gov or call
up the White House web site _ www.whitehouse.gov _ and use the form
you'll find after clicking on The President &AMP; Vice President,
followed by The President.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is the numerical size of a man's hat determined? It can't
be the circumference of the head.
</P>
<P>
   A: Head size is based on the circumference of the head, but
you're right, it isn't the circumference. Casey Bush of the
Millinery Institute in New York cited information from the book
``Hat Life Directory,'' which uses this example in explaining how
hat size is determined. If a string is placed around a head and it
measures 21.8759 inches, and this circumference of the odd oval is
made into a circle, the diameter of the circle is 7 inches. The
equivalent hat size, then, is 7.
</P>
<P>
   This is for American hat sizes only; hatmakers in France, Italy
and other countries use different sizes and ways of measurement.
Even among American hatmakers there's not a complete
standardization in all factories, however, so buyers would be wise
to try hats on for correct fit, no matter what the number says.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the racial breakdown of people on death row in the
United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: The NAACP Legal and Educational Fund's Capital Punishment
Project says 3,565 inmates were on death row nationwide as of April
1. It listed these statistics: white, 1,657 (46.48 percent); black,
1,516 (42.53); Latin, 299 (8.39); Native American, 48 (1.35);
Asian, 28 (.79); and ``unknown,'' 17 (.48).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm curious about the NATO military commander, Gen. Wesley
Clark. What is his educational and military background?
</P>
<P>
   A: Clark, who grew up in Little Rock, Ark., is a 1966 graduate
of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., where he
graduated first in his class. He has a master's degree in
philosophy, politics and economics from Oxford University in
England, where he studied as a Rhodes scholar between 1966 and
1968. He also is a graduate of the National War College, Command
and General Staff College and Ranger and Airborne schools.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Clark has been a White House fellow and special
assistant to the director of the Office of Management and Budget.
He also taught at West Point and served in various Army positions
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He has been commander of the National Training Center at Fort
Irwin, Calif.; deputy chief of staff for concepts, doctrine and
development at the Army Training and Doctrine Command, Fort Monroe,
Va.; commander of the 1st Cavalry Division, Fort Hood, Texas; and
commander in chief of the U.S. Southern Command in Panama. Clark
also led the military negotiations for the Bosnian peace accords at
Dayton, Ohio, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   He became commander in chief of the U.S. European Command on
July 11, 1997; he also is the supreme allied commander, Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that the woman in Boston who won the $197 million Big
Game jackpot in April couldn't claim her prize because she wasn't
an American citizen. Is that true? Why haven't we seen anything
more about her lately?
</P>
<P>
   A: Citizenship doesn't necessarily figure into the claiming of a
lottery prize, but in fact the woman you're inquiring about,
Chilean-born Maria Grasso, has been a U.S. citizen since 1984. On
April 6, she won the $197 million Big Game jackpot, the largest
single prize ever won by an individual in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The public hasn't seen her or heard much about Grasso since then
because, after claiming her windfall _ $70.2 million taken in a
lump-sum _ she dropped out of sight. She had quit her job as a
nanny for Boston millionaire and venture capitalist Chris Gabriele,
and hired a lawyer and public relations firm to deal with the
onslaught of media and other inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Grasso's relatives in Chile also have dropped from view. Chilean
television coverage showed Grasso's mother scrambling down the
front walk of her Santiago home, luggage in hand. State television
editor Denis Jones said Grasso herself apparently told her family
to duck the media. ``We called the United States and were told that
she hired a security company that recommended that,'' Jones added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In one of his novels, Tom Clancy writes about the ``seven
sisters of women's colleges,'' but he doesn't list them. Then I
read an article that identified Radcliffe as a ``Seven Sisters''
school, saying it was to merge with Harvard. Can you fill me in on
the other six?
</P>
<P>
   A: In addition to Radcliffe, which is in Cambridge, Mass., these
are the others: Vassar, Poughkeepsie, N.Y.; Smith, Northampton,
Mass.; Mount Holyoke, South Hadley, Mass.; Barnard, New York City;
Bryn Mawr, Bryn Mawr, Pa.; and Wellesley, Wellesley, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you print the poem read at the funeral of Rachel Scott,
one of the students killed last month at Columbine High School?
</P>
<P>
   A: A number of people spoke and gave readings at the April 24
service at Trinity Christian Center in Littleton, Colo. The only
poem in the CNN transcript is this, written by a cousin of Rachel
Scott identified only by her first name, Sara:
</P>
<P>
   Looking down, seeing despair / Only leaving a soul-searching for
air / Feeling the warmth, seeing the light / Reaching for wings of
eternal flight / Slipping away from this world today / Angel of
mine, you found your way / Let my love be the wind beneath your
wing / As you rejoice in heaven in seeing / Angel of mine, watch
over me always / Because I will need you in my heart in many ways /
You, my angel, I promise to you, to share your rhythm and rhyme to
them, you will show them what's true / Angel of mine, your face
will make the heavens so bright / With your beauty, grace and
loving spirit / Only God knows why you were shot / But I know I
shall never forget my beloved friend and cousin, Rachel Joy Scott.

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: The G-7 and G-8 countries are much in the news. But why does
the media refer to them by both numerical designations? What's the
difference?
</P>
<P>
   A: The name at first was Group of Seven (or G-7) for the seven
largest industrial countries in the world: the United States,
Germany, France, Japan, Canada, United Kingdom and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The organization originally came together in response to the
OPEC-induced oil crisis of the 1970s. The increases in oil prices
rocked the stability of the global monetary system, creating
massive deficits in balance of payments accounts. Representatives
of the seven nations met to discuss mutually agreeable
macroeconomic and monetary policies that, it was hoped, would
neutralize the effects of the imbalance. By 1997 the president of
Russia was being included, so G-7 became G-8.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the Commission of the European Union also is
often included in economic summits for discussions of economic and
political issues, but as yet that hasn't created any momentum for
adding yet another number.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It is true, as I've heard, that Al Gore and Tommy Lee Jones,
the actor, were roommates at Yale?
</P>
<P>
   A: Right people, wrong school. They were roomates at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent item about the anniversary of the burning of the
German airship Hindenburg reminded me of something I've been
wondering about for years. When I was growing up in Washington,
D.C., in the 1930s, I once saw a very large dirigible. Did the
United States have any airships comparable in size to the
Hindenburg?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Hindenburg, which exploded and burned May 6, 1937, was
804 feet long and 135 feet wide, making it the largest rigid
airship ever constructed, according to Encyclopedia Britannica.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy experimented with airships in the 1920s and '30s, and
it's possible you might have seen one of them. The Navy's Akron and
Macon were large enough to carry fighter airplanes, both launching
and receiving them while in flight. While it didn't state their
exact dimensions, World Book Encyclopedia described the Akron and
Macon as ``giant.'' Or you may have seen Germany's Graf Zeppelin,
which flew more than 1 million miles between 1928 and 1937,
including many trans-Atlantic trips.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. construction of rigid airships was halted after the Akron
went down in a storm off the New Jersey coast in April 1933, and
the Macon was forced by bad weather into the sea off California in
February 1935. Some 75 people died in the two accidents.
</P>
<P>
   For comparison, today's nonrigid airships, such as the familiar
Goodyear blimp, average about 200 feet in length. Rigid airships,
which had a wood or metal frame, are no longer flown.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article concerning a study by J.D. Power about automobile
defects mentioned a number of makes, but not Nissan. Were any
Nissan vehicles tested? If so, how did they do?
</P>
<P>
   A: Information about Nissan vehicles wasn't included in the
Associated Press article you saw, so it isn't known if any were
tested. In fact, the study on which the article was based was a
private report to automakers made by J.D. Power and Associates, a
global marketing information services firm based in Agoura Hills,
Calif. As reported, the findings came from a confidential executive
summary of the study.
</P>
<P>
   Information about Nissan vehicles is included, however, in the
Power firm's 1999 Initial Quality Study 2, which lists the top
three vehicles in various size categories in initial quality. In
the entry midsize segment, the U.S.-built Nissan Altima was listed
as ``best,'' followed by Plymouth Breeze and Dodge Stratus. Among
compact cars, Nissan Sentra placed third, after Toyota Corolla
(``best'') and Saturn SW (station wagon).
</P>
<P>
   Internet users can see this report at http://www.jdpower.com/
and clicking on ``Hot Off the Press,'' then on the May 5, 1999,
entry under ``What's New.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm curious about Candlestick Park in San Francisco. Where
does the name come from, and is it the official name?
</P>
<P>
   A: The official name now is 3Com Park, but many people still use
the original Candlestick name. That comes from Candlestick Point, a
rocky outcropping into San Francisco Bay that was offered in 1958
by developer Charles Harney as the site for the Giants' new home.
The team previously had been playing at Seals Stadium. The names
Candlestick Point (and Park) came from the jagged rocks and trees
that rise from the tidelands like giant candlesticks.
</P>
<P>
   Candlestick Park opened April 12, 1960. In an effort to build up
recognition of its identity, 3Com Corp. paid $500,000 to the City
of San Francisco in 1995 to have its name attached to the stadium.
In 1996, the deal was extended to January 2000 for an additional
$3.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   3Com Corp., based in Santa Clara, Calif., makes hardware that
lets computers communicate with each other across networks. It's
the No. 2 company in its field after Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about decaffeinated coffee in one of the tabloids
stated that it's best to use a product prepared by steam
distillation or the Swiss water process. It indicated that coffee
decaffeinated by other means could contain dangerous chemicals. Do
you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: Decaffeinated coffee is made by two methods, and the Food and
Drug Administration has determined that both are safe, said Chris
Rosenbloom, spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association and a
professor in Georgia State University's department of nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   In one process, caffeine is removed from the green, unroasted
coffee beans by softening them with water, flushing them with a
solvent usually containing chlorine, and heating and blowing them
with steam to remove the solvent. To obtain a product that is 97
percent caffeine-free, this process must be repeated up to 24
times. In the other process, any of five or so decaffeination
agents is mixed directly with the coffee beans to remove the
caffeine. Either way, little or no trace of the solvent ends up in
the product.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbloom added that she isn't aware of any research currently
being done that shows any danger.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On a trip to London, I noticed a statue of Abraham Lincoln in
the center of the city. Do you know who sculpted it and why it's
there?
</P>
<P>
   A: The British chose to honor Lincoln because of his policies,
such as emancipation. In addition to Lincoln's statue in Parliament
Square, a bust of him is displayed in the Royal Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The bronze statue you saw was sculpted by Dublin, Ireland-born
Augustus Saint-Gaudens and was unveiled in 1920. A replica of a
monument in Chicago, it depicts Lincoln standing in front of an
elaborate chair with the design of an eagle on its back. Sculptor
Saint-Gaudens was taken to the United States as a child, so it's
likely he wanted to take a give a touch of Americana to London
years later. The British Tourist Authority had little information
about the bust of Lincoln, other than saying it was created out of
Indiana limestone by American sculptor Andrew O'Connor (date
unrecorded).
</P>
<P>
   Q: When the president flies into a city, where does his
motorcade come from? I'm told that vehicles in the motorcade are
bulletproof, so I'm sure there aren't such vehicles already in
place in every city he visits. Are they driven in advance to
wherever he goes?
</P>
<P>
   A: The president's armored limousine, and any other armored
vehicles required for a motorcade, come from Washington, said Jim
Cool of the Secret Service. They aren't driven to each location,
however; they're flown aboard military aircraft in advance of the
president's visit. Local non- armored vehicles, such as police and
highway patrol escorts, also are routinely part of a motorcade, as
you know.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My son is interested in joining the CIA when he completes his
Air Force service. What are the requirements, what is the procedure
for applying, and where can he get information?
</P>
<P>
   A: An applicant must be a U.S. citizen and must successfully
complete a thorough medical examination, a polygraph interview and
an extensive background investigation.
</P>
<P>
   A number of fields are open, both immediately (such as applied
research psychologists, biological scientists, computer scientists,
economists, energy analysts, information threat analysts, nurses
and polygraph examiners) and on an ongoing basis (computer and
electronic engineers, interpreters, language instructors, imagery
analysts, security protective officers and software development
engineers, among others).
</P>
<P>
   Those interested should send a resume and cover letter. The CIA
says it will respond within 45 days if there is further interest.
</P>
<P>
   The best source of information can be found on the Internet at
http://www.odci.gov/cia/ciahome.html and then clicking on How to
Apply. A Job Kit and Resume Guide shows how to format your resume
properly. Or call the CIA, 703-482-1100, and ask for the recruiting
center.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An obituary on Joe Adcock, first baseman for the Milwaukee
Braves, said he hit a home run on May 26, 1959, that didn't count
because he passed Hank Aaron on the bases. I don't understand what
that means. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: A runner who passes another runner on the basepaths is
automatically out. The incident in question occurred at Milwaukee's
County Stadium. Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Harvey Haddix set down
the first 36 Braves he faced, throwing 12 perfect innings. But the
Pirates, too, were being shut out.
</P>
<P>
   In the 13th inning, the perfect game ended with Felix Mantilla
reaching base on an error. Mantilla moved to second base on a
sacrifice by Eddie Mathews. With the perfect game over and first
base open, the Pirates gave an intentional walk to Hank Aaron to
set up a possible double play. Adcock, the next batter, not only
broke up the no-hitter, but also won the game for Milwaukee when he
hit a hanging slider over the right center field fence. Aaron
didn't see the ball sail into the seats, but he did see Mantilla
cross the plate. Assuming the game was over, he ran from second
base straight to his dugout instead of continuing to third and
home.
</P>
<P>
   After a huddle, officials declared that Adcock was out for
passing Aaron on the bases, but would be credited with a double for
allowing the man on second base to score. Since Mantilla scored,
the game was over, with the Braves winning 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   End.

PRESERVING THE EVIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, Adobe's Acrobat system has been the gold standard for
publishing printed documents over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Most computer companies distribute their manuals as Acrobat
``PDF'' (Portable Document Format) files from their Web sites,
letting customers download the files and print them out.
</P>
<P>
   The big advantage of PDF is that you can view a PDF file and
print it out on almost any computer, no matter whether you have a
Windows-based PC, a Macintosh, or even a UNIX workstation.
</P>
<P>
   The second advantage of PDF is faithfulness: PDF documents are
designed to look and print exactly the same on every combination of
computer and printer. That's why the Internet Revenue Service
distributes tax forms in PDF format, and why a growing number of
scientists are using Acrobat and PDF to distribute preprints of
their scientific papers.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Adobe released version 4 of its preeminent Acrobat
software. This new package has powerful features for creating and
managing PDF files. It's also a really handy tool if you want to
sue somebody over their Web site.
</P>
<P>
   For the litigation-minded, Acrobat 4 is truly a breakthrough.
The new product will automatically download pages from the Web and
use them to create a PDF file, completely preserving the text,
links, and images. You can then take the Web site, digitally sign
it, and save it away into a single file. This is really useful,
because when there is objectionable information on a Web site, it
can change quickly. Acrobat 4 gives attorneys and others a powerful
tool for preserving the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to download all the images and pages from the Web is
great even if you aren't going to take somebody to court. For
example, a salesperson going on the road could download their
entire company's Web site. They could then give a fast presentation
on a laptop computer, using Acrobat, without having to find a
telephone jack and deal with the slowness of a modem connection.
</P>
<P>
   Acrobat has always been great for electronic forms. A small
newsletter, for example, might use Acrobat to create a form for
advertising insertion orders. The sales manager could then keep a
copy of the form's PDF file on her computer's desktop. When
somebody needs the form, she could print it out and send a paper
copy, fax it using her fax modem, or e-mail out the Acrobat file.
With Acrobat 4, you can also generate Web pages complete with
complex JavaScript, giving the manager even more publishing
options.
</P>
<P>
   Although Acrobat 4 has a lot more options than its predecessor,
the program is actually easier to use. For example, when you go to
create an Acrobat file using Adobe's ``Acrobat Distiller'' program,
there is a simple pull-down menu that lets you optimize the PDF
file for screen display, for printing, or for a printing press.
With the previous version of Acrobat, you had to go into several
configuration screens and change about a dozen options to get the
correct results.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem that I had with Acrobat version 3 was deciding
between Adobe's PDF Writer and the Acrobat Distiller. Both programs
can be used to create PDF files. The PDF Writer program was easier
to use, but the Distiller did a better job. With Acrobat 4 you
still have the choice of Distiller and the Writer, but they are now
both easy-to-use. Oh, Distiller still does a better job.
</P>
<P>
   Like its predecessor, Acrobat 4 also has a lot of tools for
editing Acrobat files themselves. You can change text, add
annotations, delete pages from files, or combine Acrobat files
together. This editing capability can be really handy. If you
discover a small glitch in a big manuscript, you can just go in and
fix the error, rather than regenerating the original PDF file.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have created a PDF file, you can password-protect it.
This prevents somebody else from opening the file without knowing
the password. Unlike the password systems used by Microsoft Word
and Word Perfect, Acrobat's password system is based on RSA Data
Security's encryption technology. This makes it much harder for
somebody to access the contents of your Acrobat files without your
permission. Besides the password, you can also specifically
disallow printing, changing, selecting text, and making
annotations.
</P>
<P>
   As I hinted above, Acrobat 4 also adds a comprehensive digital
signature system for documents. With Acrobat 4 you can create your
own digital signature. You can then use this signature to digitally
``sign'' a PDF file. Along with the signature you can specify that
you are the author, that you have approved the file, that the file
is certified, and so on. This is an important step for giving
electronic documents the legal standing that paper documents now
enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, one of the best things about Acrobat 4 is file
compatibility. All of the files that I created with Acrobat 4 I
could easily read back with the freely-available Acrobat 3 reader.
I wish that other companies would follow Adobe's lead by creating
software that has both forward and backward file
</P>
<P>
   compatibility.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, I've noticed that a lot of companies have started
e-mailing Microsoft Word files as a way of sharing documents.
Unfortunately, this is a rather dangerous practice, since Microsoft
Word files can carry computer viruses and other hostile macros.
It's far safer for companies to e-mail PDF. Let's hope that Acrobat
4 makes them reconsider their ways.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, my only objection to Acrobat 4 is the price _ a rather
steep $230 each for the Macintosh and Windows versions. If you
don't want to pay for Acrobat but you need to generate PDF files,
you might look into the program GhostScript. Available for UNIX,
Linux, Windows, and many other operating systems, GhostScript has
the ability to generate its own PDF files that can be read back
with the Acrobat reader. Unfortunately, GhostScript's PDF files
tend to be between 10 and 100 times larger than the compact PDF
files that Adobe's
</P>
<P>
   Distiller creates.

IT'S RESEARCH, I SWEAR IT IS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY   
 c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I find myself suddenly deluged with porno
e-mail on America Online. I am curious how I became the recipient
of such drivel. My only Internet usage has been for e-mail and for
searching medical literature through the Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spammee
</P>
<P>
   DEAR SPAMMEE: Well, where do you think congressmen keep all
their dirty books? No wonder you're getting those solicitations.
And I wasn't aware that the latest copy of ``Big Buxom Babes'' was
considered ``medical literature.'' I'm more of a National
Geographic man myself.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think you're special just because some scumbucket is
filling your mailbox every morning. Spam is a fact of life. Who
knows how you got on the list? It could have been that time you
typed in the wrong keyword or visited the American Urological
Association home page or downloaded pictures of farm animals for
your kid's school project. There are slimeballs out there who spend
their whole day trolling AOL and a hundred other places for
potential suckers.
</P>
<P>
   About all you can do is set your mail controls to accept letters
only from a pre-approved list of other AOL members and Internet
addresses. And nobody says you have to read any of the crud you
receive. Delete it all and go back to your research, unless you
actually think a letter with a subject line of ``Free XXX pics''
could be from dear old Aunt Mabel. And that's just plain sick.
Maybe you should run for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I just read an article that when you visit a
Web site, you provide information about yourself, including your
viewing habits, search terms, etc. What is the truth?
</P>
<P>
   _ Not So Anonymous
</P>
<P>
   DEAR NOT: Are you kidding? They even know if you're wearing
clean underwear. The people who build Web sites are fond of pulling
every little trick out of the book when it comes down to figuring
out who you are and why you'd like to buy their products or enjoy
their muck-laden spam. Weren't you paying attention during the last
question?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, they get all the normal stuff, like what browser or
Internet provider you're using. But every time you click on a link
or search a site, there's the potential some Web weasel just earned
a commission. And if you fill out any questionnaires? Well, duh.
What did you think they were going to do with that information?
</P>
<P>
   Here it is: If you do anything at all on the Internet, then
somebody else probably knows what it is. In fact, I can tell what
you're doing right now. And you'd better stop it.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I don't understand how a program like Yahoo!
Pager knows that a particular person is online.
</P>
<P>
   _ I'm Not Here
</P>
<P>
   DEAR I'M: Isn't anybody listening to what I've been saying? If
you're on the Net, somebody somewhere knows you are there. Programs
like Pager and AIM and ICQ compound the exposure. They log you in
to a server with all the other people running those programs. When
you put people on your notification list or vice versa, the
insidious little things actually query that server to see who's on.
</P>
<P>
   Call me paranoid, but sometimes I'd like to check out that hot
urology page the first guy was looking at without everybody in the
world knowing I'm hooked up. But that's just me.

3 ONLINE BOOK RETAILERS CUT PRICES ON BEST SELLERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an escalating battle of the books, Amazon.com Inc., the
online retailer, cut the prices on best-selling books by 50 percent
Monday, a move that was matched hours later by its Internet rivals,
Barnesandnoble.com and Borders.com, all of whom will almost
certainly lose money on the bargain rates.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's price-cutting comes during a rather auspicious time for
its No. 2 rival, Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc., which has imminent plans for
a public offering of its Internet unit within the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But a company spokesman for Seattle-based Amazon.com said the
timing of its discounts on books from The New York Times
best-seller lists was a matter of coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three things that drive this business,'' said Bill
Curry, a spokesman for Amazon. ``It's selection, price and
convenience. And we are constantly working on all three of these
things. We've added convenience with distribution centers that will
get merchandise faster to customers. And this is an opportunity to
do something with price.''
</P>
<P>
   With a flurry of announcements on Monday, the three electronic
booksellers announced virtually identical plans to cut the prices
of hardcovers and paperbacks appearing on The Times best-seller
lists. That amounts to deep discounts on about 70 titles in any
given week.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, publishers offer books to retailers for less than
half of the list price, which means that the electronic rivals will
be losing money with these discounts on best sellers.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not seem to deter the major booksellers, who
offered similar reasons for plunging ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to remain competitive in the marketplace,'' said
Leonard Riggio, the chairman and chief executive of Barnes &AMP; Noble,
who added that Amazon has ``changed their prices in the middle of a
public offering for Barnesandnoble.com and that speaks for
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   With a certain element of distaste, Borders.com, a unit of
Borders Group Inc., also announced a price-cut. ``I have to tell
you that this is not the battlefield that we think we're going to
win on in the long run,'' said Rich Fahle, a spokesman for
Borders.com. ``But we're not going to let this distinguish us from
the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the booksellers set any particular time limits on the 50
percent discounts. And, in fact, Amazon was issuing refunds on the
difference in price to customers who bought best-selling books
shortly before its announcement of the discounts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kate Delhagen, director of online retail strategies for
Forrester Research Inc., a technology research firm, said the
outbreak of discounting was not particularly surprising given new
competitive pressures.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of new companies that are helping book buyers
to compare prices through Web site services such as Add All that
instantly list shipping and title costs for major booksellers. For
example, Monday that site compared the prices for more than 24
bookstores and prominently listed Amazon for offering the best
price for the best-selling children's novel, ``Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone.'' The list price is $16.95, but with the discount
and a shipping charge, Amazon was selling the title for $12.43.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are using these comparison tools,'' Ms. Delhagen said.
``And what Amazon is doing is making sure that they are there. It's
definitely a defensive strategy being deployed, but it's also part
of their increasing energy to add customers to their database.''
</P>
<P>
   Curry, Amazon's spokesman, declined to say whether the company
would lose money on the 50 percent discounts. ``We're just not
talking about whether we're selling at a profit or a loss,'' he
said. However, Curry said Amazon has decreased its reliance on book
distributors and was dealing more directly with publishers. Those
efficiencies have resulted in increased savings that Amazon is now
passing along to its customers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that the discounts were not a reaction to the
activities of competitors. ``We don't fancy ourselves with the
competition,'' he said. ``We're focused on our customers as opposed
to what the competition is doing.''

THE NEW PAUL ALLEN  
 REAL NETWORKS TRIES TO DODGE A BULLET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LAURIE J. FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hey _ didn't that used to be Paul Allen?
</P>
<P>
   Techies who are also professional basketball fans may have
noticed that Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft who owns the Portland
Trail Blazers, looks a lot more dapper these days as he takes his
accustomed seat courtside at Trail Blazers games.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on television frequently as the Trail Blazers are
having their best season in years, the 45-year-old billionaire
looks much more like a high-technology investor than the
guitar-playing, hacker geek that many recall. Gone are the rumpled
sport shirts and the beard, replaced by clean-shaven cheeks and
well-cut suits.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Allen's Vulcan Ventures investment firm,
which is based in Seattle, declined to discuss his makeover, though
one employee estimated that it began two years ago. That would be
around the time that Allen was said to be dating the tennis star
Monica Seles.
</P>
<P>
   But the spotlight is shining even more brightly on him in the
current National Basketball Association playoff season. Last week,
his team swept the Phoenix Suns in three games to advance to the
next round _ the first time the Trail Blazers have won a playoff
series since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Curious techies and sports fans alike can get more details about
Allen at the Paul Allen Web site (www.paulallen.com). There, one
can read about his interest in music education and philanthropy,
his numerous telecommunications investments and his teams (he also
owns the Seattle Seahawks football team) _ and learn that one of
his favorite movies is ``La Dolce Vita.''
</P>
<P>
   Lessons in Not Blocking the Ads That Feed You
</P>
<P>
   Real Networks is trying to dodge a bullet, one that is headed
straight for its own foot.
</P>
<P>
   The software company, which is based in Seattle, produces
so-called streaming media technology that can be downloaded free
from the Web and enables personal computers to receive live audio
and video feeds on the Web. But Real Networks has also been selling
another company's program, called At Guard, that enables PC users
to block out Internet advertising. And that doesn't sit well with
Real Networks' paying customers _ operators of Web sites that
employ Real Networks technology and that in many cases depend on
advertising for their revenue.
</P>
<P>
   After Real Networks sent e-mail a few weeks ago to tens of
thousands of people offering At Guard for half the usual $29.99
price, some Web developers fired off e-mail of their own to Real
Networks and engaged in heated debates on industry bulletin boards.
Some have threatened boycotts or even defections to other brands of
streaming media, like Apple's or Microsoft's.
</P>
<P>
   Real Networks got the message. Last week, the company decided it
would stop selling At Guard altogether after June 15, Steve
Haworth, a spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   Ad-blocking software like At Guard is intended to speed Web
viewing by stopping graphics-laden ads from downloading to a user's
PC. But many of Real Network's customers contend that widespread
use of ad-blocking software could seriously hurt their industry.
</P>
<P>
   Web viewers need to accept advertising if they want free
programming, said Scott Mathias, managing editor at ITVWorld.com, a
producer of online programming. ``If ad blocking is freely
available,'' he said, ``how will everyone's needs be met?''
</P>
<P>
   Although ad-blocking software has been available for several
years, it has been slow to catch on.
</P>
<P>
   But Anne Marshall, a product marketing manager at WRQ, the
Indianapolis company that produces At Guard, said the Real Networks
promotion had been generating strong sales for her company.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marshall said that regardless of what Real Networks had
decided, At Guard is a product that ``puts choice back in the hands
of Internet users.''

TRYING TO MOVE ONLINE RADIO BEYOND A NICHE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Until recently, it might have been fair to
enlist the cliche ``those crazy kids'' to describe people who
listened to radio on the Internet. But a series of announcements
last week signals that the demographic profile of online listeners
is expanding beyond 20-somethings to include the corporate set.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, Yahoo started a Web radio service called Yahoo
Radio (http://radio.yahoo.com/), comprising 10 audio channels that
visitors can listen to using software called the Realplayer G2 from
Real Networks. The audio programming for Yahoo's service is
provided by Spinner.com, a San Francisco company that announced
plans last week to go public in September. Separately last week,
Looksmart, another search engine, announced plans to produce an
online talk show devoted to Internet topics.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, these deals underscore the growth of a
multilayered industry with players convinced that the PC will be
the radio tuner for the next generation. The entrepreneurs driving
the convergence of radio and the Internet say that listeners will
flock to specialized audio programming delivered over the PC,
sponsored by advertising aimed at individual listeners. But the
emergence of the technology poses a question for the industry: Is
the business proposition sound, or is it more white noise about the
Internet?
</P>
<P>
   Spinner.com illustrates one example of the type of business
model these companies are relying upon. The company, founded in
1996 as TheDJ.com, offers 175,000 songs on 120 channels; the fare
includes punk, funk, gospel, gumbo, surf and swing. Visitors to the
site download a player called Spinner Plus, which enables them to
listen to the channels.
</P>
<P>
   Like traditional radio stations, Spinner.com and its competitors
license the songs at a per-play fee from music industry groups like
the American Society of Composers, Artists and Performers.
</P>
<P>
   Spinner.com makes its money by several means: displaying banner
ads on the site; embedding audio commercials within the programming
_ 90 seconds each hour _ and by taking a cut of transactions when
visitors buy music at the site.
</P>
<P>
   The company also displays banner ads on the audio player, but
because listeners can minimize the image of the player, they might
not see those commercials, the company acknowledges. Still, Josh M.
Felser, president of Spinner.com, said that the site's traffic was
growing 25 percent a month and that Spinner.com had 1.3 million
unique listeners last month.
</P>
<P>
   People who register to use the site's audio player must divulge
their sex, age and some musical interests, allowing the company to
give highly targeted information to advertisers. ``We do what radio
does, only better,'' Felser said. ``It's going to take time for ad
buyers to wake up to our capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment and the Spinner.com business model are copied by
several competitors, including Rolling Stone Radio, a partnership
between the online music hub Tunes.com and Real Networks.
</P>
<P>
   Another competitor, Imagine Radio, which was acquired in
February by the MTV Networks unit of Viacom, creates individually
customized radio stations. Visitors to the site can choose the
genre of music they want to hear and indicate which artists they
would like to hear more or less often.
</P>
<P>
   These Internet companies are vying for consumer attention with
some 1,600 traditional radio stations that have made their
programming available over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Verdino, vice president of Arbitron New Media, which
studies radio listening patterns, said more than 3,500 radio
stations were still not online. But he said they had better start
thinking about it, citing studies showing that people who listen to
radio on the Net listen to less radio on traditional stations.
``It's potentially'' a threat, he said. ``It's also potentially an
opportunity.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A study released in April by Arbitron New Media found the
portion of Internet users who had listened to radio online more
than doubled in the previous six months to 13 percent from 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be huge,'' said Rotem Perelmuter, former chief
executive of Imagine Radio and now vice president for strategy at
MTV, referring to online-only radio content. ``The operating
profits from radio are $6 billion,'' he said. ``We're going to take
a big chunk of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is so optimistic, at least in the short term. Some
industry analysts say that despite the recent growth, most radio
listeners will not regularly turn to their PCs for listening.
Skeptics point out that the audiences even for the most popular
online radio hubs remain in the low tens of thousands of visitors
daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``A radio advertising executive is going to look at that traffic
and go, `Come on, I can't sell advertising on that,' '' said Mark
Hardie, a senior analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge,
Mass. Hardie thinks online radio will remain a niche market.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick H. Keane, an analyst for Jupiter Communications, a
market research firm in New York, is less pessimistic. Keane said a
new category of at-work radio listener was emerging. He said he
thought there was a growing market for online audio programmers to
reach into offices where employees may listen while they work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're definitely looking at a niche audience, but I'm firmly
convinced it's going to grow,'' Keane said.

E-COMMERCE REPORT: THE BUSINESS OF PAYING BILLS ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeing opportunity in every crevice of the economy, a growing
number of Internet commerce companies now want to serve as the
bearers of bad news _ in this case, delivering bills online.
</P>
<P>
   And the idea seems to be catching on, with some of the nation's
biggest billers adopting online systems and one of the Internet's
most popular Web sites expected to offer similar billing services
by the end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is simple. A company sends e-mail to customers,
notifying them to check a Web site for new bills. Or, alternately,
customers simply know to check the site at regular intervals. In
either case, the billing agent charges merchants a small fee while
allowing them to save the $3 or so that it typically costs to print
and mail a paper bill. Customers pay their bills online without
incurring postage or check-processing fees. And banks save on
processing costs, because there is no paper to push.
</P>
<P>
   One key to the success of this approach, analysts and executives
say, is to aggregate the billers on a single site to make bill
delivery and payment as quick and painless as possible for
consumers. Unless enough large billers are willing to move to
online billing, though, the practice appears to have little chance
of proliferating.
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies competing to bring more billers online are
the Checkfree Corporation, the industry leader so far, and
Transpoint, a joint venture of Microsoft, First Data and Citigroup.
As billing agents, Checkfree and Transpoint work with companies
like BellSouth and Consolidated Edison to deliver their bills
online and with banks to work out the online payment process.
</P>
<P>
   Transpoint and Checkfree are racing to create partnerships with
the biggest billers, such as electric utilities, credit card
companies and mortgage lenders. Checkfree's early lead in the field
comes in part from its having started sooner, in early 1997; the
company says it has signed up many of the nation's top billers,
including GTE, Chase Credit Card and MCI Worldcom.
</P>
<P>
   Both Checkfree and Transpoint are also signing partnerships with
banks, so that a customer can visit his or her own bank's Web site
and view and pay the bills of every company signed up by either
billing agent.
</P>
<P>
   Since banks have offered various types of proprietary online
bill-payment services for years, consumers can be expected to
gravitate first toward bank Web sites to view and pay their bills.
But stiff competition for the banks is on the way from portal Web
sites, the gateways to the Internet that are visited by millions of
Internet users each month. Though no portal deals have been made
public, analysts say Checkfree and Yahoo have reached an agreement
for Yahoo visitors to receive and pay the bills issued by each of
Checkfree's merchant partners. (Yahoo and Checkfree declined to
comment on the deal.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This technology is unbelievably sticky,'' Robert Sterling, a
Jupiter Communications analyst, said, using industry jargon for
features that keep viewers coming back to a particular site.
Customers who pay bills on one site will not only return out of
habit, Sterling said, but will be reluctant to learn another site's
system. With tens of billions of bills mailed in the United States
each year, at least millions of repeat site visits could be at
stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is potentially a King Midas technology,'' Sterling said.
</P>
<P>
   But if online bill delivery can save customers time, save
merchants and banks money and provide Web sites with guaranteed
visitors, why are fewer than 1 percent of the nation's merchants
offering the service?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a chicken-or-egg problem,'' said Lewis Levin, chief
executive of Transpoint. ``Billers have been saying that they'd do
something like this if there were billions of customers who were
dying to get their bills on the Internet. Customers say they'd love
to get their bills on the Internet if only billers would deliver
them. I think the billers have finally realized they're the
chickens and they have to invest in order to get this started.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The investment, however, is significant. It costs an average of
$150,000 to build a Web site with the technology to present bills
to customers and accept payments online, executives from Transpoint
and Checkfree said. Both companies provide the software that
enables consumers to view and pay their bills online, and they
charge merchants roughly the price of a stamp for each bill
processed.
</P>
<P>
   For AT&AMP;T, one of the nation's biggest billers, such an
investment was well worth the price, said Daniel H. Schulman,
executive vice president for consumer markets. AT&AMP;T introduced its
online billing service in March 1998, using a system designed
in-house, Schulman said. Hoping to gain broader exposure for this
service, AT&AMP;T is now negotiating to have its bills offered through
Checkfree, too.
</P>
<P>
   Schulman said the company had been aggressively promoting the
service. He would not disclose the number of customers using the
system, ``but we do well over a couple hundred million dollars in
electronic billing per year,'' which he said could save up to 60
percent of the cost of paper bills. The system, at www.att.com,
also enables customers to apply online for on-the-spot credit for
disputed long-distance charges and to learn about special pricing
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could see if someone is making a slew of international
calls,'' Schulman said, ``and we could offer them a plan for that
when they're paying at our site.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the online billing service makes it easier
for customers to obtain a wealth of information about their
accounts _ such as the name of each person called rather than just
the phone number. In addition, customers who set up an online
billing account receive a discounted long-distance rate of 9 cents
a minute, with no monthly fee, as compared with 10 cents a minute
and a $4.95 monthly fee for AT&AMP;T's ``One Rate Plus'' calling plan.
</P>
<P>
   Banks are also offering incentives for consumers to pay their
bills online. The Union Bank of California, for example, offers
free banking and checking for a year when customers join its online
program. Analysts and executives say that creating such consumer
inducements is crucial to the success of online bill delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billers save money, but there aren't really enough incentives
yet for consumers,'' said Ullas Naik, senior vice president for
research at FAC Equities/First Albany, an investment banking firm.
``Only when they offer those incentives will we see a broad-based
migration.''
</P>
<P>
   Naik suggested one such incentive: ``Take a buck off each bill
if you receive and pay it online. That could save you $10 a
month.''

START-UP LEADS PHONE CAUSE IN BATTLE FOR INTERNET ACCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Michael W. Malaga, chairman of Northpoint
Communications Group Inc., stood at a whiteboard in his office here
recently and explained how his newly public company planned to
change the Internet business.
</P>
<P>
   Northpoint builds high-speed data networks using normal phone
lines _ an approach that could render the networks of most current
Internet service providers obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   He drew a box on his improvised map of the Bay area. ``So ISP's
have these big modems pools in every city,'' Malaga said, referring
to the conventional Internet service providers, ``and these access
points for dedicated services like T-1 lines,'' he continued,
drawing another box. ``And then they aggregate the traffic
somewhere else to transport to another city,'' he added, drawing a
third box and connecting them all with lines.
</P>
<P>
   After pausing, the 34-year-old executive erased the entire
schematic with three swift strokes. ``In the future,'' he said,
``they won't have to do any of this. We will allow ISPs to become
sales and marketing companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether by ``allow'' he really means ``force.''
Although it had revenue last year of only about $1 million,
Northpoint, which raised $360 million in an initial public stock
offering on Nasdaq on May 5, now has a stock market value of about
$5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company is perhaps the most advanced of a small cadre of
aggressive new players that are building high-speed Internet
networks based on a technology called digital subscriber line, or
DSL. It is a technology that, if widely embraced by computer users,
could do away with the dial-up modem access offered by the leading
Internet service providers, like the network-access portion of
America Online's business or Internet access provided by companies
like Mindspring Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   DSL is shaping up as the telephone network's main weapon against
the cable television industry's mounting campaign to offer
high-speed Internet access. That is why the Baby Bell local
telephone companies themselves are taking a hard look at DSL. But
so far, the smaller and nimbler DSL upstarts like Northpoint are
the ones having more success turning the technical concept into
commercial reality.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, if the Internet service providers really are
fated to obsolescence, they may be planting the seeds of their own
destruction: for those companies are Northpoint's main customers.
</P>
<P>
   Northpoint uses advanced DSL technology from Copper Mountain
Networks Inc., which itself went public on Thursday, raising $84
million and achieving a stock market value of $1.5 billion. The
technology, which combines software and hardware, enables
Northpoint to build networks that can deliver up to 1.5 million
bits of information a second _ or about 30 times as much Internet
data over a normal phone line as is possible with a conventional
56,000-bit-a-second modem. Rather than sell the use of those lines
directly to customers, Northpoint strikes deals with Internet
service providers to use its systems to resell the high-speed data
service to small and medium-sized business users and residential
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, computer users seeking high-speed access through the
telephone network have typically used a special kind of circuit
called a T-1 line. T-1 can deliver 1.5 million bits of information
a second, but it might cost the user $800 or more a month. A
comparable system based on Northpoint's DSL network might cost the
user as little as $350. As a result, an Internet service provider
can resell Northpoint's DSL lines more economically than providing
its own T-1 lines or leasing such lines from a telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   But the fundamental rules of communications economics mean that
the success of Northpoint and its initial DSL competitors, Covad
Communications Group Inc. and Rhythms Netconnections Inc., may very
well spell the end of broad profitability for traditional Internet
providers.
</P>
<P>
   But Northpoint cannot afford to be greedily gleeful about this
prospect. For if the Baby Bell local phone titans also expand into
DSL, those same economic rules could endanger the long-term success
of Northpoint and the other DSL upstarts.
</P>
<P>
   An essential economic characteristic of the communications
industry is that communications networks cost a lot to build but,
once built, relatively little to operate. While it may cost
billions to build a fiber optic link from New York to Los Angeles,
for instance, it costs only pennies, if that, to transmit a call
using that network.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the companies that control the assets _ the optical
fiber, the switches, the advanced gear for transmitting data from
one point to another _ control the pricing for communications
services. These companies also reap most of the profits. It is very
difficult to generate long-term success in the communications
business by leasing communications capacity from others.
</P>
<P>
   The quest to control physical communications assets, and thus to
control one's own costs and increase profitability, is the basic
rationale behind many of the billion-dollar deals that have become
so routine in the telecommunicatons business. That is why
Northpoint's business model may look so attractive to investors but
also so potentially dangerous for Internet providers.
</P>
<P>
   For everyday Internet providers, squeezed between America
Online's marketing juggernaut in the consumer market and the power
of international giants in the big-business segment, Northpoint
offers a compelling proposition. Northpoint can build the DSL
network, operate it and maintain it. That frees Internet providers
to concentrate on finding customers, operating e-mail and World
Wide Web server computers, selling the service at a markup and
answering the phone when something goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
   By using Northpoint, even the smallest Internet provider gets
access to a high-speed data system more advanced than just about
anything America Online is using _ and competitive with the cable
modems that are beginning to sprout around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But in one sense a deal with Northpoint is a Faustian bargain.
The sacrifice is profit margin, because Northpoint controls the
asset. An example illustrates the case: Northpoint generally sells
a 160-kilobit line to an Internet provider for $75 a month.
Flashcom, which is based in Westminster, Calif., and is one of
Northpoint's biggest customers, sells that same line to end users
for $79.95 a month.
</P>
<P>
   With discounts for buying in bulk, Flashcom is probably paying
less than $75 _ but not much less. Because Northpoint controls the
asset, Northpoint controls most of the profits.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is pursuing much the same strategy, but using cable
television systems, rather than traditional phone lines. When
America Online and other Internet providers complain that AT&AMP;T will
not have to offer the use of its cable systems to other Internet
providers, what they really fear is the prospect that AT&AMP;T will
sell access to those systems at prices that keep the bulk of the
profits for itself.
</P>
<P>
   For Northpoint, the potential pitfall in its business plan is
that the very economic forces that could let it absorb most of the
profits from traditional Internet providers could eventually
undermine its own profitability. Northpoint, after all, has to
lease the actual copper phone lines to its customers from the Baby
Bell phone giants (though at rates that are regulated).
</P>
<P>
   The company connects to those circuits by installing its own
network equipment inside the Bell companies' central switching
offices. Northpoint buys this equipment from Copper Mountain and
hires Lucent Technologies Inc. to actually install it. Moreover,
Northpoint deals with the end-user customers only through its ISP
resellers. Given all this, what _ if anything _ is Northpoint's
long-term asset?
</P>
<P>
   ``The asset is really in the co-location,'' Malaga said,
referring to the deals Northpoint has struck to place equipment
inside the Bells' central offices. Northpoint has hundreds of such
deals, each of which can take months to negotiate. That has given
Northpoint a head start on many of its potential rivals.
</P>
<P>
   But in the long run, the Bells are compelled by regulation to
offer co-location to just about any company that asks for it. What
that means is that Northpoint might well end up being more valuable
as an acquisition target for a bigger company _ a Bell, say _
looking to make a quick DSL splash.

SOFTWARE THAT HELPS CREATE NEW INVENTIONS RECEIVES PATENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps it was inevitable that someone would one day patent the
act of inventing. Certainly the age of computer modeling and
powerful, nimble technical software has made it possible for a
group of inventors to now own what it calls an ``invention that
creates new inventions.''
</P>
<P>
   The patented software program aims to eliminate the need for an
engineering degree in product design and instead allow everyday
inventors to find out what would happen if they really tried to
build a device or implement a process they have in mind. It takes
its inspiration from computer-aided design programs now commonly
used by engineers and designers to try out and modify new ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Five inventors, all originally from the former Soviet Union,
designed the software, which enables a user to create an
engineering model of an invention idea, and then test the model's
scientific properties. At each stage, the software offers
descriptions and illustrations of the science or engineering
concept involved, chooses technical properties that will work in
combination, and suggests alternatives to the mechanics or the
method.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, an inventor should not need a technical
background, though the software is laden with physical, geometric
and chemical laws, theorems and hypotheses that only an engineer or
scientist could love.
</P>
<P>
   The inventors say their software goes beyond computer-assisted
design and into what they call in the patent ``concept
engineering.'' The purpose, they say, is to help designers and
inventors come up with new ideas, evaluate and trouble-shoot them,
and consider different engineering approaches for realizing their
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``These systems serve to increase the designer's inventive and
creative abilities in solving engineering and scientific
operational or functional problems and, in the course of such
problem solving, induce the designer to invent new structural and
functional concepts applicable to his/her design goals,'' the
inventors write in their patent.
</P>
<P>
   The software enables a user to quickly understand the technical
results that are being sought, the structure and function of
engineering devices, and how such devices might produce those
results if two or more are linked together. The inventor can
simulate the effect of combining engineering properties,
manipulating parts of those properties or adding his own customized
properties. The software itself will automatically combine
engineering components in an effort to refine the invention or
suggest new designs and problem-solving techniques to the inventor.
</P>
<P>
   The program is built around a data base of scientific and
engineering concepts and their effects. Using key words, an
inventor can search through 6,500 entries and pull up full-motion
animation and a text description of each concept.
</P>
<P>
   But first, the inventor must state an objective. The software
then suggests engineering concepts that can make that design
objective a reality. Each suggestion is accompanied by an
explanation and illustration.
</P>
<P>
   An inventor can connect the effects of two or more concepts to
see what will happen, or he can simulate the results of changing
parameters. He can click on a prompt that leads the software to
offer other engineering or scientific facts that will improve the
performance of his device or process.
</P>
<P>
   The inventor can bookmark his most commonly researched effects,
and he can store the system's suggestions in his computer.
</P>
<P>
   The software creates animated versions of the engineering
effects, shows 5 to 10 seconds of full-motion video, describes the
reactions and gives any examples of similar technologies that
already exist.
</P>
<P>
   The patent belongs to the Invention Machine Corp.. The company
has already incorporated it into its computer-assisted design
software, which can be examined at www.invention-machine.com..
</P>
<P>
   The inventors, Leonid Batchilo, of Arlington, Mass., Valery
Tsourikov of Boston, Vitaly Glazunov of Moscow, and Alexandre
Kirkovski and Alexandre Korzoun, from Minsk, Belarus, received
patent 5,901,068.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

FCC TO STUDY NEED FOR BROADBAND RULES By ANDREW J. GLASS  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON-- Government regulators plan to move cautiously in
framing rules to govern high-speed digital services for consumers,
Federal Communications Commission Chairman William Kennard said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As telecommunications companies increasingly offer Internet
service, the FCC must weigh to what extent it should regulate what
Kennard pointed out is an essentially unregulated medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be very, very careful about injecting government
into a market like the Internet, which has thrived quite well
without a lot of government intervention,'' Kennard told a National
Consumers League forum on information technology.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard argued that consumers have benefited because the
Internet market ``has been effectively unregulated.'' But he said
the FCC will soon seek wide public comment ``on access to the
broadband pipe so that we can gain a better understanding of how
this marketplace is developing and whether there is an appropriate
regulatory response to this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have is the cable companies moving into the Internet
and the telcos moving into the Internet,'' Bell Atlantic Chairman
Ivan Seidenberg, another forum speaker, said. When fully
implemented, their rival broadband technologies will be capable of
offering high-quality video and audio links to the World Wide Web,
as well as other interactive consumer services.
</P>
<P>
   Seidenberg agreed with Kennard that consumers should have easy
entry to a host of communications gateways, including wireless and
satellite services. But he also called on the FCC to deal ``with
issue of parity,'' claiming that the cable companies currently
enjoy an unfair advantage as a result of ``disparate regulatory
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennard and Seidenberg were joined on the panel by America
Online Chairman Steve Case, who said: ``My own view is that there
are only two broadband wires into the home: the cable line and the
telephone line....
</P>
<P>
   We need to recognize that two wires taken to an extreme would
lead to a duopoly that would gut innovation and momentum in this
industry.''

   America Online recently sought to become a partner in a bid by
Comcast to acquire MediaOne Group, a big cable firm with Internet
aspirations. But, America Online, the nation's biggest online
service, backed out of the deal when AT&AMP;T trumped the Comcast offer
in an effort to become the nation's top cable provider.
</P>
<P>
   Asked after the forum about America Online's broadband strategy
in the wake of the failed Comcast overture, Case said:
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to work with any company who is interested in
working with us to try to move this medium forward and try to take
advantage of the audience we have to sell their technology.
Certainly AT&AMP;T is on the list of companies we'd love to work with
as long as we can establish a win-win partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   Case noted that about one-third of all U.S. households currently
possess Internet access. Although only a tiny fraction have the
kind of fast connections that are increasingly common in the
workplace, that number is expected to rise rapidly in the next five
years.

How to play the game at E3 
By Omar Gallaga  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What's the hardest part about the video game
business?
</P>
<P>
   Forget about bringing bloodthirsty aliens to life or building
virtual worlds.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest part of the business may be convincing folks in the
real world to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   In today's competitive gaming world, game makers have got to
convince hard-core gamers that they're not just selling a shameless
rip-off (even if it is a sequel) or something that's as boring as a
modern-day Pong.
</P>
<P>
   You've also got to be at the right place at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're George Lucas, the best place to sell the game hype
is at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, which wraps
up today after three days. How's the game played at E3, as the expo
is known?
</P>
<P>
   Learn from the folks at Austin-based Iguana Entertainment and
its parent, Acclaim Entertainment, who let me spend some time with
them at E3:
</P>
<P>
   _Create the illusion of exclusivity.
</P>
<P>
   Acclaim's booth was a circular structure with a single entrance.
Anyone who wanted to see the inside, including its upcoming games,
had to get past security.
</P>
<P>
   _Throw a party, but keep people out of it.
</P>
<P>
   A party scheduled for after the show for Acclaim was restricted
to VIPs. Likewise, Eidos Interactive whetted attendees' appetites
by sending out hundreds of invitations in advance to a House of
Blues party that featured Everclear and David Bowie, then turned
away half the crowd when the place got too full. And a VERY private
party thrown by game developer Psygnosis at the Playboy Mansion was
a distant dream for hopeful E3 attendees _ it was booked up before
E3 began.
</P>
<P>
   _Get some celebrity endorse- ments.
</P>
<P>
   Acclaim brought in motocross racer Jeremy McGrath to sign
autographs. Electronic Arts hosted wrestlers from the WCW and Bowie
was guest of honor with Eidos. Acclaim makes the Jeremy McGrath
Supercross game.
</P>
<P>
   _Get some sexy celebrity endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Acclaim welcomed buxom personality ``Debra'' from the World
Wrestling Federation to sign autographs too. Strangely, her line
was longer than McGrath's. Acclaim produces WWF Attitude.
</P>
<P>
   _Announce important-sounding news.
</P>
<P>
   Acclaim announced Thursday that it was changing the names of the
companies it owns. So, after this week, Iguana will cease to exist.
It will be called Acclaim Austin. Releasing news during E3 gives
the appearance that a company is a mover and shaker. And it makes
it so much easier to distribute those pesky press releases.
</P>
<P>
   _Remember that floor space equals buzz.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest names at E3 had the biggest booths. Sony. Sega.
Nintendo. Microsoft and Electronic Arts. Acclaim claimed a huge
chunk of space for a relatively small area of game demonstrations.
But because of the security mentioned earlier, the general E3
public didn't know that, and had to wonder what kinds of goodies
were inside.
</P>
<P>
   _Give out free stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Acclaim and Iguana handed out stickers to publicize the new
Chef's Luv Shack game that Iguana produced in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   _Oh yeah, the games.
</P>
<P>
   Have at least some games available to players.
</P>
<P>
   If they're good, the players will come.

Online TV listings go far beyond daily schedules 
By Bill Husted  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Once upon a time, it was considered a technology that
had the potential to tear apart the American home.
</P>
<P>
   Parents worried that kids would get the wrong ideas from it.
Some people spent way too much time using it and _ in the process _
lost opportunities to take part in real life. Some experts wrote
long articles praising it, saying that the technology would change
education and bring arts to the masses. Others said it was the tool
of the devil.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about television. Long before there was an
Internet, many of the same fears and hopes were fanned by the other
box that invaded the home. Obviously, these two technologies have a
lot more in common than their flickering monitors. So it's only
fitting that we spend today talking about how to use the Net to
make TV watching more fun and efficient.
</P>
<P>
   At the most basic level of the marriage between PC and Web,
there are the online listings for programming. Several sites offer
listings, but one of the best comes from the folks at Yahoo! You'll
find the listing at tv.yahoo.com/yahoo/moretopics.dpg.
</P>
<P>
   It's a well-designed service. On that page, you'll find about 30
topic areas, including romance, science-fiction, adventure, comedy,
religion and movies. To show you how the listings work, click on
``movies'' and see what happens. You're zapped to a page that looks
very much like a newspaper listing of TV movies. It automatically
pops on the screen for today's date, but you can use pull-down
menus to change the date or the way the information is presented.
Once you have set up the page to suit your taste, you can browse
the movies on tap for that day from AMC, TBS, TNT or any of the
networks or programming services that offer movies.
</P>
<P>
   If you find a movie you like, you can click on the title and get
a mini-review. You'll also find links on this page that will take
you to listings for the major satellite TV services including USSB
and DirecTV.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say, however, that you want your TV listings served up
according to where you live and the cable TV provider that serves
that area. Simply stick with Yahoo! but go to tv.yahoo.com/. Enter
your ZIP code and you'll get the listings (if there is more than
one provider serving your area, you'll get a pull-down menu that
lets you pick the cable company).
</P>
<P>
   At the risk of giving too much space to Yahoo!, let's take a
look at one other service provided by the search engine: a soap
opera update that you'll find at tv.yahoo.com/soaps/soap.dpg?d
</P>
<P>
   &QC; 1&AMP;wk &QC; 1. If, for instance, you forgot to tape last week's ``The
Bold and the Beautiful,'' you can simply click on the listing for
that soap opera to get the latest details. This is detailed, if
drably written, stuff. For instance, a recent summary explained:
``Rick tells himself over and over again that he is married to
Amber and they have a son. Brooke confronts Amber and her mother
and boasts that she knows the terrible secret about the baby and
why Amber couldn't give birth with anyone around.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't get the idea that Yahoo! is the only place to get TV
listing information. Here's a page with links to almost any TV
listing service you can name: www
</P>
<P>
   .buttle.com/tv/schedule.htm. And, since it offers worldwide
television listings, you may enjoy browsing the listing services
for South American and European networks.

Design Shop builds Web sites well 
By Jack Warner  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Anyone wishing to make a no-holds-barred Web site
without learning HTML code ought to consider investing in a program
called Internet/Intranet Design Shop Gold.
</P>
<P>
   You're going to have to invest in something if you want a
what-you-see-is-what-you-get Web site builder, and Design Shop is
the best I've seen. It not only does the job, it comes with just
about all the bells and whistles you'd want to add to your site.
</P>
<P>
   As a sort of by-the-way feature, it will also do posters,
banners, certificates and calendars for printing on paper.
</P>
<P>
   Because Design Shop is powerful, one needs to go through the
tutorial and keep the manual close at hand for a while. It's not
really a difficult program to use, but its many features lead to
complications.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat like Microsoft's Front Page, it provides various views
of the Web site being created, all of them selected from a screen
called the Site Manager.
</P>
<P>
   The Physical Layout view presents the site in a tree-like
structure. Most of the work will be done from the Logical Layout,
which presents each page with its relationship to others. The
Navigate Layout screen shows all connections, chiefly to let the
user hunt for any missing or broken links.
</P>
<P>
   There are controls that make it simple to keep a standard look
from page to page in the site, but these controls are also easily
overridden if you want to get crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Creating frames is quite simple, and you can stuff a bunch of
them on a page if you wish. Tables are also easy to handle, and can
be expanded to cover an entire page and used to keep bulleted items
in order. As in a word processor, standard headers and footers can
be created and the program will place them on each page.
</P>
<P>
   Design Shop comes with 45,000 images, sound clips, videos and
animations that can be used in a Web site; there is also a powerful
graphics editor and 25 separate types of business charts. There are
a bunch of templates _ basically, ready-made items _ for every
function of the program, including Web sites. Good for those who
want to do something, but don't know what or even why.
</P>
<P>
   A one-button click gives you a preview of any page at any time.
</P>
<P>
   I tried hard to find something to carp about here, and all I
could come up with concerns the icons on the multitude of menu
bars. They are rather obscure and unintuitive. So there.
</P>
<P>
   Internet/Intranet Design Shop Gold is made by Boomerang
Software, and it retails for $139. It ought to be generally
available, but if you can't find it at a store, go to the Web site
www.boomerangsoftware.com.

Computer, Internet privacy starts with the basics 
By Bill Husted  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Can we have some privacy?
</P>
<P>
   That's what folks will tell you, if you ask about the fears they
have of the Internet and the Web. Most people will tell you they
are scared to death that some 13-year-old evil hacker genius will
steal their credit card information and use it to buy a Lear Jet;
or that some nut basket in New Jersey will make copies of all their
e-mail and send it to all the country music stations on the eastern
seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   But you have to wonder just how serious these people are when
they fret over the possibility of a cyber-criminal breaking into
their computers. If they protected their homes with the same level
of security as their home computers, they might as well hang a sign
on the front door saying: ``Come in and take what you want.''
</P>
<P>
   So instead of worrying, let's talk about some of the really
basic things you need to know to keep your computer _ and the
information it transmits and contains _ safe. Before you start
worrying about fancy programs that can worm their way in and take
control of your computer, let's fix the obvious problems first.
Just as most burglaries are done by amateurs, most computer
break-ins take advantage of some really obvious security breaches.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with passwords. Don't use your birthday, your dog's
name, a child's name or something that obvious as a password. I
feel silly saying something so obvious, but my buddies who work for
Internet companies and who administer business computer networks
swear that this advice is still needed. Use a combination of
letters and numbers and avoid any words that would be found in the
dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   If people you don't know well or don't trust have access to your
computer at home or at work, be careful of stored passwords. Even
if the password is stored in an encrypted file, it can easily be
discovered. I know it's a lot more work to type out the password
each time, but you wouldn't leave the combination to a safe taped
to its side, and it's dumb to leave your passwords sitting around
where others can get to them.
</P>
<P>
   One last bit of password advice: Most of us log onto work
systems, personal e-mail accounts and also use passwords for voice
mail and for pay Web services. Avoid using the same password for
everything. It's like using a master key for all your locks. If you
do slip up and lose that key, then every lock you have is
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's talk about chat rooms. I don't much care if you think
that they are warm and inviting places where really interesting
people gather to engage in deeply meaningful conversations, or
whether you think that they are works of the devil where the
tattoo-to-person ratio exceeds that of the U.S. Navy of 1941. We're
not here today to talk about your private life, or even to take
sides as to whether you ought to have one. Instead let's talk about
computer security.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging out on an IRC channel is very much like wandering down a
dark street with $20 bills taped to your body. We don't have time
to cover every possible opportunity that chat rooms offer even the
slowest-witted cyber-invader. But I promise you that IRC chats are
the modern day equivalent to wearing a sign that says ``kick me.''
If you want to chat and care about privacy, buy a rocking chair and
get some friends.
</P>
<P>
   Or, if your life is such that chat rooms offer your only chance
for contact with humanity, then at least consider avoiding the IRC
channels and use AOL or Web-based chat instead.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, try to avoid falling for any of the really stupid
tricks you'll see on the Internet. Don't tell someone your
password, even if they claim that they've been appointed lord over
all the Internet; don't lend your password or an e-mail account to
a friend.
</P>
<P>
   None of these tips will turn your PC into the cyber equivalent
of Fort Knox. But they do serve as important first steps in making
it safe from casual intruders.

Wired schools get graded by FamilyPC 
By Charles Haddad  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ How wired is your school? Now you can compare, using
the latest issue of FamilyPC magazine. The May issue includes a
list of what the magazine considers the top 100 wired high schools.
Among those that qualified were Armada Senior High School in the
town of the same name in Michigan. Others were Hunterdon Regional
High School in Fleming, N.J., Ketchikan High School in the Alaskan
town of the same name and Mashpee High School in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The same issue of FamilyPC takes a look at what, if any, role
the Internet played in the tragedy in Littleton, Colo. It offers a
package of articles examining the Internet, violent software and
the effectiveness of programs that filter Net content. Not
surprisingly, the magazine concludes that it's hard, if not
impossible, to understand whether the Internet played a decisive
role in the school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   The school year is ending, but that doesn't mean your kids have
to stop learning. Microsoft has released a collection of
educational software for elementary school kids. The package of
computer CDs is called ``My Personal Tutor: Grades 1st and 2nd.''
The software offers educational games designed to help kids sharpen
their math, reading and thinking skills. Its available only for
Windows PCs and workstations.
</P>
<P>
   Graphic artists, take note. Deneba Software in Miami has
released the latest version of its graphic design program Canvas 6.
This version blends illustration, photo editing and typography into
one package. The program also includes 30,000 clip art images and
2,450 fonts. Available for both Macs and PCs, Canvas 6 retails for
$375. Upgrading an earlier version costs $200.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Workshop, producer of ``Sesame Street'' and other
popular kids' shows, has created a Web site designed for mothers
with babies and toddlers. The site provides advice on caring for
young kids and keeping them busy in healthy ways. It also offers
scads of other links to useful sites. You'll find this site, called
Baby Workshop, at www.ctw.org/babyworkshop/.

FORMER HACKER SAYS TEXAS PROSECUTOR TRYING TO DOWNLOAD HIM INTO
CELL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By PATTI MUCK  
c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUGAR LAND, Texas _ From the blackness of his bedroom, Dark
Spyre would be awakened by a desk lamp clicking on.
</P>
<P>
   Hooked to his computer, it would signal him _ sometimes in the
middle of the night _ that a fellow hacker was ready to begin.
</P>
<P>
   For several weeks in late 1993 and early 1994, Ryan David
Schwartz, alias Dark Spyre, was a high school senior by day, a
computer hacker by night. Breaking the security code of a
long-distance phone company based in Mississippi, he was able to
charge thousands of dollars worth of computer bulletin board calls
to the company.
</P>
<P>
   When Sugar Land police showed up at the Houston-area home he
shared with his grandparents and mother in March 1994, Schwartz
confessed to hacking. They took his computer, all of the
components, even the desk lamp.
</P>
<P>
   Indicted on two counts of felony theft a month after his
graduation, he pleaded guilty in January 1995. He was sentenced to
five years' deferred adjudication _ a punishment that would expunge
the conviction from his record if successfully completed _ plus 450
hours of community service, court costs and nearly $5,000
restitution.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just a year shy of completing his probation, Schwartz faces
a motion to revoke the probation. Revocation could send him to
prison and end his pursuit of a degree at Baylor University in
Waco.
</P>
<P>
   From Schwartz's perspective, the Fort Bend County District
Attorney's Office set him up for failure from the start and has
treated him more like a violent criminal than an intelligent young
man who made a mistake and was willing to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   From the prosecutor's perspective, Schwartz has been thumbing
his nose at the court and deserves to be punished.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has he ignored probation conditions that included
orders not to use a computer, but he has abused a string of second
chances, Assistant District Attorney Mike Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame in a lot of ways, because he's a bright kid,''
said Elliott, who, coincidentally, is the computer expert in his
office. ``But he just can't leave it alone. He's got an
addiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz denied violating his probation. He insisted that he has
been walking the straight and narrow _ working nearly full-time at
a Service Merchandise store in Waco, attending classes at Baylor
and frantically rushing back to Fort Bend County every Friday
afternoon to meet with his probation officer.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar Land, an affluent community just outside of Houston, is
about 150 miles from Waco.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has not used a computer and that fellow students have
typed papers for him, which, according to his understanding of the
probation, was allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott said the ruling was clear: Schwartz is forbidden from
using a computer, period. Allowing someone else to use a computer
on Schwartz's behalf, and using Schwartz's password, is the same as
if Schwartz had used it, Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to get school done and get a degree and get a
career going,'' said Schwartz, now 23.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott contended that Schwartz doesn't merit pity. Not only did
Schwartz ignore a warning from LDDS Metromedia Communications, the
long-distance company, to stop hacking long before the criminal
charges were filed, but he also violated his probation by accessing
the Internet and using a computer, the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a game to them,'' he said of computer hackers. ``They
don't see the danger, the real harm in what they're doing. Many
people are under the misconception that if you do a crime on the
computer, it's not that bad, like murdering somebody.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is a crime _ a felony crime. How many people's phone
bills went up because of acts he and others did? Everybody pays for
his kind of crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz's probation problems started early, when he contended
that his severe asthma prevented him from the lawn-cutting and
outdoor maintenance chores that are typical of community service.
</P>
<P>
   He had enrolled at the University of Houston in August 1994 and
attended classes there through May 1995. After his enrollment at
Baylor in July 1995, the community-service hours became more
difficult to complete.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1997, the first motion to revoke Schwartz's
probation was filed, alleging that he had failed to report to the
probation department in February, May and June 1996 and that he had
failed to perform community service. A probation department report
said Schwartz hadn't done service for a year.
</P>
<P>
   It also maintained that, even after being referred to light duty
because of his asthma, Schwartz failed to report for community
service in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   He denied that, saying he had reported but wasn't given an
assignment compatible with his health.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he was instructed to clean out a dark, cellarlike
room at a Waco charitable organization, he said. It was, he said,
infested with rats, an environment his asthma was unable to
tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   He kept the job for only one day. A promised assignment in a
library never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was willing to do the work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After a hearing in December 1997, state District Judge Bradley
Smith did not revoke his probation but made several changes in its
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz was given an additional 600 hours of community service,
to be completed by Jan. 1, 1999. And he was forbidden from
operating a computer without written court permission.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz took off a semester and reported for work daily at the
Precinct 4 justice-of-the-peace office to complete his community
service. His mother, Linda Schwartz, a secretary, paid the
restitution, and his grandparents, Greta and Izu Schwartz, 71 and
73 respectively, helped pay lawyer and bond fees.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the family had stacked up about $50,000 in payments to
bail bondsmen and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The family thought that the ordeal was nearing an end and that
Schwartz could finish college and get his degree in finance and
management information systems. He wants to have a career in
financial consulting or investments.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz applied for early termination of his probation after he
completed his community service, but was turned down.
</P>
<P>
   Although the court granted his request to return to Baylor, he
was told to report to the probation office in Richmond at 4 p.m.
every Friday. Schwartz said he did his best to comply, leaving as
soon as classes or work were through and driving hard to make the
deadline. But he was late three times, clocking in at 4:25 p.m. one
time, at 4:31 p.m. another time and at 4:16 p.m. another.
</P>
<P>
   After using several lawyers, the family hired Houston attorney
Dick DeGuerin to try again to get the probation terminated early.
Schwartz obtained a letter from an associate dean at Baylor, saying
he lacked 39 hours to graduate and would have to have access to a
computer to complete his course work.
</P>
<P>
   An assistant professor at Baylor wrote to Judge Smith, asking
that Schwartz be allowed to use a computer ``and move on to a
career in business.''
</P>
<P>
   While supportive letters were filling Schwartz's court file,
Elliott was getting tips that the probationer was actively using
the computer, the Internet and e-mail at Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   The second motion to revoke his probation was filed in March. It
is set for a June 10 hearing before Smith, who has a reputation
around the courthouse of being tough on wayward probationers.
</P>
<P>
   The Schwartz family views the latest development as continued
torture, referring to Elliott as a persecutor instead of a
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to put him in jail. That's what they want,'' said
Linda Schwartz, 47. ``He was young and foolish,'' she said, but he
has paid for his mistake. ``Now we don't know what to do. We're
going crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, meanwhile, is preparing for the hearing. If Schwartz's
probation is revoked, he could receive two to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times can you thumb your nose at the court and get
away with it?'' Elliott asked. ``He would have had a very bright
future with some company. Why couldn't he do something constructive
with his time instead of trying to beat the system?''
</P>

INTERNET FUELS REVIVAL OF CENTRALIZED `BIG IRON' COMPUTING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEVE LOHR with JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHAUMBURG, Ill. _ As Walt Grom tours his domain _ row upon row
of hulking black computers _ he speaks of the importance of
``fundamental engineering disciplines'' and ``brute force
experience.'' The vast room is spotless, brightly lit and chilled
by air conditioning, an austere interior designed for the care and
feeding of big computers.
</P>
<P>
   The huge datacenter, run by IBM, is one of the engine rooms of
the Internet, powering the World Wide Web sites and electronic
commerce operations of some 400 companies and organizations
including BankAmerica, Macy's, Goodyear and the National Hockey
League.
</P>
<P>
   Such computer centers, known as server farms, are the
unglamorous side of the Internet revolution _ a world apart from
the young, urban culture of Web design artists with their tattoos
and earrings. Here, a no-nonsense style prevails, and the hallways
tend to be populated by big, beefy men with beepers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy to do the plumbing,'' said Grom, who runs IBM's
server farm in Schaumburg.
</P>
<P>
   Internet datacenters are sprouting up across the country in a
sure sign of the trend toward once again housing information and
computer power centrally _ a seeming reversal of the last two
decades of computing.
</P>
<P>
   The personal computer has defined the industry's recent history
and how computers were used. As personal computers spread rapidly
in the early 1980s, they were seen as engines of individual
empowerment and decentralization of information. Millions of
islands of information were suddenly stored on desktop machines _
knowledge residing in the spreadsheet, word processing and database
programs of individuals. It was a technical and social repudiation
of the previous three decades, dominated by mainframes and
minicomputers, a computing formula based on ``big iron'' machines
that held all the information.
</P>
<P>
   But in an odd alliance, the Internet _ hailed as the technology
behind a new economics, tearing down old hierarchies and flattening
corporate organizations _is fueling a recentralization of
information and a revival of big iron computing.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet holds the promise of anytime, anywhere access to
information and entertainment delivered over powerful networks to
an array of information appliances like handheld devices, cell
phones with screens and television set-top boxes, not just personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   That makes the present round of information centralization very
different from the old days. The glass-house datacenters of the
1960s were controlling gatekeepers, with information rationed from
the center. Today's modern server farms, by contrast, are powerful
nodes on the Internet, making information more readily available to
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   There are, to be sure, privacy concerns raised by the prospect
of creating increasingly large digital storehouses of personal
information. Those concerns, technology experts say, require
clear-cut corporate and public policies to protect privacy as
collecting, storing and distributing information becomes easier and
cheaper in a digital economy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even personal computer pioneers generally regard the
shift to Internet-based computing as an irreversible step toward
efficiency rather than a retreat from the information democracy
they sought to foster.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to own their own information but they don't want
to maintain it, and that is driving the shift toward
centralization,'' said Adele Goldberg, a member of the team at
Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in the early 1970s that created the
founding concepts of personal computing.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Internet, companies are starting to embrace
centralized computing again for the first time in decades. ``A real
mind shift is under way in corporate America,'' Scott Winkler, an
analyst at Gartner Group, a research firm, said.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, corporate America is following the Internet
leaders. For behind an America Online or an Amazon.com is a massive
arsenal of computing power. America Online Inc. supports its
service to more than 16 million subscribers _ with a million people
using the system simultaneously on many evenings _ with two vast
server farms in Virginia and a third one planned, a $520-million
project announced in March. (Such datacenters are known as server
farms because they are veritable crop-rows of big computers that
send, or serve, data out to users.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The good old economics of scale really do apply when it comes
to server farms,'' Marc Andreessen, the chief technology officer of
America Online, said.
</P>
<P>
   The new model of computing _ a proliferation of information
appliances linked by the Internet to server farms _ has been called
the ``post-PC era.'' For the post-PC vision to be fully realized
will take years, and billions of dollars of investment to build
ultra-fast digital networks, wireless technology and new kinds of
handheld and other devices.
</P>
<P>
   And to say that computing appears to be heading toward a post-PC
era is not to say the PC will become obsolete anytime soon. Indeed,
the PC industry has benefited from the rise of the Internet so far
because the PC today is the principal access device to the Net.
Desktop alternatives to the PC like the ``network computer,'' or
NC, running only a Web browser for tapping into the Internet _
first proposed in 1996 by Lawrence Ellison, chairman of Oracle
Corp. _ have not yet slowed PC sales.
</P>
<P>
   But the evolution toward the Internet model, most analysts
agree, represents the most significant change in the industry since
the PC replaced the mainframe as the center of gravity in computing
two decades ago. The shift represents a daunting challenge to the
big winners of the PC industry, Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp.,
whose software and microchips are the essential technology in most
PCs. Their high profit margins are expected to erode as consumers
increasingly use simpler, lower-cost devices to tap into the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies recognize the challenge and are responding. As
one step, Intel announced in April that it was planning a big move
into Internet services by building and running server farms. The
move seems a big departure for Intel, whose microprocessors serve
as the electronic brains of most PCs. But Intel sees the server
farms as part of its future of moving beyond the personal computer
to become a ``building-block supplier'' to the Internet economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PC industry is changing drastically,'' said Andrew Grove,
the chairman of Intel, ``and when it's over it probably won't even
be called the PC industry. It will become the Web infrastructure
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is preparing for the day when people may keep much of
their personal and professional information on large servers with
an initiative called Megaserver. The concept is that a person will
be able tap into a large central database via the Web to get
e-mail, personal schedules, news, weather updates and other
information anywhere, anytime.
</P>
<P>
   Even Microsoft concedes the access device will not always be a
PC. ``While the PC will stay central, we realize there is demand
for computing on non-PC devices,'' said Steven Ballmer, the
Microsoft president.
</P>
<P>
   An early test bed for the Megaserver concept is Hotmail, a
Web-based e-mail system, which Microsoft bought for an estimated
$300 million in January 1998. Since then, the number of users of
the free e-mail service has jumped from less than 10 million to 40
million. With Hotmail, a person can retrieve e-mail from anywhere
with any PC or other device equipped with a Web browser instead of
being required to use a particular machine loaded with one's own
e-mail software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hotmail has served as a big wake-up call for us, and we're
delighted that we bought it,'' John Ludwig, a vice president of
Microsoft, said.
</P>
<P>
   Hotmail is supported by four large datacenters, and Microsoft is
using them as incubators for developing the heavy-duty software
needed to run server farms, thus improving the capabilities of
Windows NT, the company's most powerful operating system. But
Microsoft, Ludwig notes, is also working to improve the software
the user sees, making it easier to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more software to write than ever before _ that's the
good news for us,'' he observed.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft added another centralized information service in April
when it acquired Jump Networks Inc., a Web-based calendar and
datebook system.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's move came a few weeks after America Online purchased
an Internet calendar service, When Inc., for an estimated $150
million. The start-up, which stores personal scheduling information
on a Web site, started its fast-growing service just four months
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies are headed in the same direction, though from
different starting points, one a software giant, the other an
online service. Clearly, the line between software and services
will increasingly blur as the shift to Internet-based computing
proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   In an internal memo last fall titled ``The Era Ahead,'' Bill
Gates, the Microsoft chairman, pointed to the opportunity as
software becomes more a services business. ``We get a closer
relationship with customers and a predictable revenue model because
they pay us a regular fee for the service,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But Gates also warned of the rising threat to some Microsoft
products likely to come from online services. ``A company such as
America Online is in competition for all our information-management
software, because they can do it through their servers,'' he
observed.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, dozens of start-ups have been created as
Internet services to centrally handle personal information. The new
companies mostly focus on e-mail, calendars and back-up file
storage to insure information is not lost when an individual's PC
crashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these applications should be moved onto the Internet
because it is more reliable, available everywhere and cheaper,''
said Eric Brewer, a University of California at Berkeley computer
scientist who is a co-founder of Inktomi Corp., a Web software
company.
</P>
<P>
   Building and running the computing engine rooms behind these
Internet services promises to be a good business for years to come.
Yet this behind-the-scenes technology business _ like the market
for Internet appliances _ will most likely be more diverse and
competitive than the bygone mainframe era, whose dominant supplier
was IBM, or the current PC era, ruled by Microsoft and Intel.
</P>
<P>
   The start of the trend back to central computing has already
been rewarding for the established producers of ``big iron''
machines like Sun Microsystems Inc., a leader in computers running
the powerful Unix operating system, and IBM, whose mainframes have
been retooled as Internet servers. The big Unix and mainframe
server computers range in price from $100,000 to millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big growth for us has been in everything-dot-com _ the
revolution in Internet commerce in all its forms,'' said Edward
Zander, the president of Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as more and more companies begin to view the Internet
not as an experiment but as a technology on which they run their
businesses, they need Web sites, e-mail networks and Internet
order-processing systems to be up and running around the clock,
seven days a week. That kind of reliable, industrial-strength
computing is the traditional bailiwick of mainframes and Unix
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Still, PC technology is improving steadily and PC servers _
typically using Intel microprocessors and Microsoft's Windows NT
software _ are increasingly tackling heavy-duty computing chores.
Some heavily trafficked Web sites, handling huge amounts of
business, are backed up by server farms using mostly PC technology.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer Corp., a direct marketer of PCs, says that sales
from its Web site are now running at a pace of $5 billion a year.
``Look at our Web site,'' Michael Dell, the company chairman, said.
``It's Dell servers running Windows NT. Yes, we have a way to go at
the high end of computing, but don't bet against the PC industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Hargreaves does not much care about who supplies the
technology. He just wants it to work.
</P>
<P>
   Hargreaves manages an electronic commerce project at Goodyear
Tire and Rubber Co. _ a company Web site set up to more efficiently
distribute and share information with its tire dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The current system, which is gradually being phased out, is
costly by any measure _ time, paper or aggravation. Three thick
packets of documents are mailed out each week to Goodyear's 2,400
dealers in the United States and Canada. The company's call center
in Akron, Ohio, receives 2,500 inquiries a day from the dealers,
many of which are merely to obtain routine information on prices
and the availability of tires.
</P>
<P>
   All of that kind of information _ along with sales reporting _
is being transferred to the Web site. A third of Goodyear's North
American dealers are online and using the Web site, though the rest
are joining soon, and Hargreaves is already impressed by the
results. The call center is reporting fewer routine calls, he says,
and dealers say they are getting more timely information, which
helps them sell more tires and improve customer service. The weekly
mailings will be stopped at the start of next year.
</P>
<P>
   For all the attention understandably focused on the meteoric
rise of online retailers and auctioneers, like Amazon and Ebay, the
biggest economic impact of the Internet in the next few years is
expected to be inside old-line companies like Goodyear _ boosting
productivity by electronically automating back-office transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Though Goodyear has an in-house datacenter, it chose to let
outside experts provide the computing power for its Web site _ a
role known as hosting _ and run its electronic commerce network.
Many companies are making the same choice. That is why the Web
hosting business of both established companies like IBM and AT&AMP;T,
and newcomers like Exodus Communications Inc. and Verio Inc., is
projected to grow from $696 million last year to $10.7 billion in
2002, according to International Data Corp., a research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies like America Online, to be sure, will have
their own server farms. But others increasingly view computing as a
utility, a service to be purchased like electricity. Indeed,
technology historians note that when factories began using
electricity in the late 19th century, each had its own power plant.
Later, regional utilities were created and sold electric service to
the factories.
</P>
<P>
   At Goodyear, Hargreaves seemed to apply the same logic to his
company's decision to have its Web site for dealers managed by IBM
at its server farm in Schaumburg. ``We're in the tire business,''
he explained. ``Why run the digital power plant ourselves?''

U.S. SEARCH ENGINE IS STOPPED HOURS AFTER DEBUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A few hours after starting a fee-based search
engine for federal government Internet sites and documents, the
Commerce Department put the project off Monday to review whether it
conflicts with the Clinton administration's policy on unrestricted
access to government information.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce officials said the administration wanted to review the
joint venture by the National Technical Information Service and
Northern Light Technology Inc. from all policy angles, not just
that of the Information Service, which is a for-profit agency.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement that the project was being delayed came several
hours after the Information Service and Northern Light officials
held a news briefing to demonstrate the search engine at the
National Press Club and after newspaper articles about the project
had appeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``In announcing the product and joint venture with Northern
Light, we did not anticipate any conflict with government
information policies,'' the acting under secretary for technology,
Gary R. Bachula, said in a statement. ``But questions that have
arisen today point up the need for a review of this service from a
policy perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Bachula added, ``Specifically, press reports today raise
questions of consistency with government information policy, and we
want to make sure that this search service, which was to be sold by
subscription, is appropriate and fits within government policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration's longstanding policy is to insure that all
government information is open and unrestricted, the Commerce
Department said. Any fees are to cover only the cost of
dissemination.
</P>
<P>
   The National Technical Information Service, a Commerce
Department agency that falls under Bachula's purview, by law
charges users for its products and services.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Information Service is financed from fees for its
products and services. It is also authorized by law to enter joint
ventures with private-sector entities to make government
information not otherwise available accessible to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed fee in the Northern Light joint venture would be
for the use of the search engine. The government data that the
search engine, to be known as usgovsearch.com, would analyze would
remain free and accessible independently to the public, the
department emphasized.

   MIDLIFE-JOURNEY _ ALLIANCE, Neb. _ As I drove to see
``Carhenge'' in Alliance, Neb., I kept saying to myself: ``There
has to be more to this than I've been told.'' A colleague told me
what I'd see: ``It's unbelievable. You go into this field off town
and this farmer's got a bunch of cars set up exactly like those
mysterious stone formations at Stonehenge in England.'' Carhenge?
Druid farmers in Nebraska? ``Trust me, you've got to see this.''

   MANIC-MOMS _ The end of May and early June may be the busiest
weeks of a parent's year, except for Christmas. There are school
parties to organize, Brownie troop year-end camping trips to plan,
teacher gifts to buy and summmer daycare to line up, as well as the
wrapup of spring sports and the start of summer ones. Add in
vacations and juggling work schedules around your kids' needs, and
you've got the makings of parental stress. (Lee, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) WITH ILLUSTRATION. MOVED.

   DOUBLE-DUTCH-JUMPROPE _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Smack-dab in
this month's issue of ``Teen People'' is a fashion spread starring
Stan's Pepper Steppers, the reigning world champs of double-dutch
rope jumping. Bring down the old clothesline from grandma's attic.
This sport is cool. Double-dutch jumping, first popular in New York
City, involves two ropes twirling in opposite directions and one or
two jumpers doing tricks _ flips, rolls, push-ups, all without
stopping. (Anna, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   FASHION-SPANDEX _ WACO, Texas _ S-T-R-E-T-C-H out and relax _
it's going to be a fluid-fit, wrinkle-free, comfy-as-can-be summer.
Stretchy spandex and Lycra fibers are showing up in trace amounts
in everything from clingy dresses to plus-size shirts and from
trousers to tailored jackets. (Mays, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

   COXNET FOOD 0515 FRIED CHICKEN MAKEOVER _ We don't eat fried
chicken anymore. Right? Wrong, nugget breath. We're eating fried
chicken all right, and a lot more than you might suspect. We're
just not calling it that. It now parades around town as nuggets,
strips, fingers and chunks (Crider, Austin American-Statesman) Art

porch and think about it. (Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

out seven hours for tickets,'' 26-year-old Paul Herris said after

 DOES YOUR CHILD HAVE A HEARING PROBLEM?

<TEXT>
<P>

America's favorite baby doctor and longtime columnist for The New
York Times Syndicate. Dr. B.'s Q&AMP;As and essays are a magnet for

 &UR; By T. BERRY BRAZELTON, M.D. &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Parents often worry about whether or not their baby's hearing is
normal. There is certainly reason for concern. Lack of hearing can
greatly interfere with an infant's development.
</P>
<P>
   Profoundly deaf babies are slowed down in all areas. They are
likely to appear depressed and unreactive _ slow to develop motor
skills and to reward parents' attempts at interaction. They may lie
in their cribs passively, or they may develop autisms _ such as
head rolling or other repetitive behaviors _ as if to fill up empty
space.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, their other senses, such as sight and touch,
become heightened. This can make a baby hypersensitive and easily
overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are ways to test the hearing of a baby. I
find it is best to do it when she is asleep or as she is just
rousing. I use a soft rattle and a bell, in a quiet room. After
several startles, a baby with normal hearing will shut out or
ignore either of these sounds.
</P>
<P>
   A quiet room is one of the keys to this assessment. If I test a
baby in a noisy environment, she may have already shut out auditory
input. Then she can appear to be deaf, even though she's not. The
reason for the two stimuli is to test the range of her hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Another test would be to give the baby a chance to respond to my
voice when she's awake and looking at the ceiling. If she quiets
and slowly turns to my voice, I know that she hears me. If her
mother and I compete on either side of her, she should choose the
higher-pitched female voice.
</P>
<P>
   If there is concern about a baby's hearing, the primary
physician usually refers the child to an otolaryngologist (ear and
throat specialist), who can examine the ears and upper respiratory
tract. If the cause is a temporary condition, the otolaryngologist
will provide treatment. If the hearing loss seems permanent, the
child may be referred to an audiologist who can perform further
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Tests, such as auditory evoked responses (AER), can detect major
hearing impairment in babies _ before it interferes seriously with
the child's development. If there is any indication that a baby is
not hearing or hears in certain ranges but not in all, I'd suggest
a complete evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing loss may become more obvious in the second year, as a
child who is beginning to speak garbles words in a regular fashion.
I would always be aware of hearing impairment as a possibility in a
child who is not developing properly, particularly in areas of
communication.
</P>
<P>
   Otitis media (infection of the middle ear) can threaten a
child's hearing. Many infants develop a tendency to chronic otitis
media. After an acute earache, the pressure and the discharge seem
to linger despite antibiotics. Otitis media is sometimes called
glue ear _ as if the ear contained glue that was hard to mobilize.
</P>
<P>
   Chronic infection of the middle ear can cause hearing
impairment. Infants in group care or infants with older siblings in
school who are exposed to many different infections are
particularly vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Ear infections may follow colds as often as every two weeks.
Each ear infection becomes more difficult to treat. Parents and
physicians get discouraged. The baby's general condition is often
affected; she seems to become rundown and vulnerable to everything.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, an ear and throat specialist should be consulted.
It may be necessary to use tubes in the child's eardrums. They
allow drainage, reduce pressure in the inner ear and prevent
hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
   Following the development of speech and other forms of
communication is the most important way of determining whether
there is hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
   With an older child, if you are concerned about hearing, try
whispering in one ear or the other. Be sure to whisper something to
which you know she will want to respond, since there are many
periods in a child's development when ``selective attention'' can
be operating. Whisper a welcome question, such as, ``Do you want to
go to town with me?'' or ``Do you want a cookie?''
</P>
<P>
   In my office, I put my finger in one of the child's ears and
whisper in the other, ``Do you want a lollipop?'' This is almost
sure to get a response. If there are no responses and/or speech is
developing inappropriately, I refer the child for evaluation by an
otolaryngologist or testing by an audiologist.
</P>
<P>
   In future columns Dr. Brazelton will answer selected questions
from readers. Questions or comments should be addressed to Dr. T.
Berry Brazelton, care of The New York Times Syndication Sales
Corp., 122 E. 42nd St., New York, N.Y. 10168. Questions of general
interest will be answered in this column; Dr. Brazelton regrets
that unpublished letters cannot be answered individually. &QL;

   Another test would be to give the baby a chance to respond to my
voice when she's awake and looking at the ceiling. If she quiets
and slowly turns to my voice, I know that she hears me. If her
mother and I compete on either side of her, she should choose the
higher-pitched female voice.
</P>
<P>
   If there is concern about a baby's hearing, the primary
physician usually refers the child to an otolaryngologist (ear and
throat specialist), who can examine the ears and upper respiratory
tract. If the cause is a temporary condition, the otolaryngologist
will provide treatment. If the hearing loss seems permanent, the
child may be referred to an audiologist who can perform further
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Tests, such as auditory evoked responses (AER), can detect major
hearing impairment in babies _ before it interferes seriously with
the child's development. If there is any indication that a baby is
not hearing or hears in certain ranges but not in all, I'd suggest
a complete evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing loss may become more obvious in the second year, as a
child who is beginning to speak garbles words in a regular fashion.
I would always be aware of hearing impairment as a possibility in a
child who is not developing properly, particularly in areas of
communication.
</P>
<P>
   Otitis media (infection of the middle ear) can threaten a
child's hearing. Many infants develop a tendency to chronic otitis
media. After an acute earache, the pressure and the discharge seem
to linger despite antibiotics. Otitis media is sometimes called
glue ear _ as if the ear contained glue that was hard to mobilize.
</P>
<P>
   Chronic infection of the middle ear can cause hearing
impairment. Infants in group care or infants with older siblings in
school who are exposed to many different infections are
particularly vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Ear infections may follow colds as often as every two weeks.
Each ear infection becomes more difficult to treat. Parents and
physicians get discouraged. The baby's general condition is often
affected; she seems to become rundown and vulnerable to everything.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, an ear and throat specialist should be consulted.
It may be necessary to use tubes in the child's eardrums. They
allow drainage, reduce pressure in the inner ear and prevent
hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
   Following the development of speech and other forms of
communication is the most important way of determining whether
there is hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
   With an older child, if you are concerned about hearing, try
whispering in one ear or the other. Be sure to whisper something to
which you know she will want to respond, since there are many
periods in a child's development when ``selective attention'' can
be operating. Whisper a welcome question, such as, ``Do you want to
go to town with me?'' or ``Do you want a cookie?''
</P>
<P>
   In my office, I put my finger in one of the child's ears and
whisper in the other, ``Do you want a lollipop?'' This is almost
sure to get a response. If there are no responses and/or speech is
developing inappropriately, I refer the child for evaluation by an
otolaryngologist or testing by an audiologist.

   QUESTION: My 10-year-old daughter is very friendly and enjoys
playing with other kids, but she has no friends. She calls kids on
the phone, but they don't call back. She has had classmates come
over to our house, but no one invites her to theirs. She is in
extracurricular activities such as Girl Scouts and dancing class,
but she does not see anyone after these activities are over.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't complain, but I know she longs for a playmate and
friend. Any suggestions? _ L.K., Leesburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   DR. BRAZELTON: Maybe this is revealing something about your
daughter that you don't see yourself. If you could understand why
other children aren't attracted to her, you would be better able to
help her.
</P>
<P>
   When other children can't or won't relate to a child, that child
may have a deeper problem. For example, your daughter may bully
other children or try to control them because she feels insecure
herself.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, I would take this situation seriously. Consult her
teachers or a psychologist who can evaluate her. Meanwhile, try to
find your daughter a child who is like her in temperament. Woo the
other child by taking them to a museum or a movie. Try to get them
together regularly for something they can enjoy. If your daughter
can make one friend, it will be easier for the two of them to enter
a peer group _ together.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I'm a single mom of a 2-year-old son. He was 4 months
old when I left my husband and moved from Arizona to Tennessee so
that my parents could help me raise him. My ex-husband never
contacts us anymore, and I have no idea where he is living now.
</P>
<P>
   My son and I will soon be moving back to Arizona. I have always
been open with him about his daddy, telling him, ``Every child has
a mommy and a daddy; yours just lives in another state.'' But when
he gets older and starts to understand more, how do I explain to
him that his dad just couldn't handle the responsibility of raising
a child? I don't want him to think he is the reason he has no daddy
_ or blame me! _ No Name, Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   DR. BRAZELTON: You may never be able to explain it
satisfactorily to him. A child will always long for the other
parent. He is likely to blame himself (and you) for losing his
father: ``If I were a better boy, he would have never left me.''
</P>
<P>
   You need to be ready to repeatedly reassure him that his
father's abandonment had nothing to do with him. Tell him that you
and his dad couldn't make it together. You need to assume the blame
to protect him.
</P>
<P>
   You should also assure him that you will never leave him. A
child without one parent always fears the loss of the other.
</P>
<P>
   Is it necessary for you to leave your supportive family now?
Being a single parent can certainly be difficult, and it may be
hard for your son to be without an extended family or close friends
as cushions when stressful times hit.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My 10-year-old daughter is very loud when she eats or
drinks. The sound she makes is like a moaning/heavy breathing. It's
nearly impossible to get through a meal without telling her to
quiet down.
</P>
<P>
   Should I ignore this and hope she grows out of it, or keep
reminding her about it so she doesn't embarrass herself at social
functions? Could this be a health problem? _ R.T., Clinton
Township, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   DR. BRAZELTON: I am not familiar with a physical reason for her
heavy breathing at mealtimes, but I suggest that you consult her
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no physical reason for the breathing, she may be
trying to get a response out of you. If this is the case, ignoring
it is the best way to diminish it.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to let her know that others may find the heavy
breathing socially unacceptable, say that once _ and then shut up.
More pressure from you may just cause her to repeat it.

 DOES YOUR CHILD HAVE A HEARING PROBLEM?

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (The following is a sample column by Dr. T. Berry Brazelton,
America's favorite baby doctor and longtime columnist for The New
York Times Syndicate. Dr. B.'s Q&AMP;As and essays are a magnet for

 &UR; By T. BERRY BRAZELTON, M.D. &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Parents often worry about whether or not their baby's hearing is
normal. There is certainly reason for concern. Lack of hearing can
greatly interfere with an infant's development.
</P>
<P>
   Profoundly deaf babies are slowed down in all areas. They are
likely to appear depressed and unreactive _ slow to develop motor
skills and to reward parents' attempts at interaction. They may lie
in their cribs passively, or they may develop autisms _ such as
head rolling or other repetitive behaviors _ as if to fill up empty
space.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, their other senses, such as sight and touch,
become heightened. This can make a baby hypersensitive and easily
overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are ways to test the hearing of a baby. I
find it is best to do it when she is asleep or as she is just
rousing. I use a soft rattle and a bell, in a quiet room. After
several startles, a baby with normal hearing will shut out or
ignore either of these sounds.
</P>
<P>
   A quiet room is one of the keys to this assessment. If I test a
baby in a noisy environment, she may have already shut out auditory
input. Then she can appear to be deaf, even though she's not. The
reason for the two stimuli is to test the range of her hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Another test would be to give the baby a chance to respond to my
voice when she's awake and looking at the ceiling. If she quiets
and slowly turns to my voice, I know that she hears me. If her
mother and I compete on either side of her, she should choose the
higher-pitched female voice.
</P>
<P>
   If there is concern about a baby's hearing, the primary
physician usually refers the child to an otolaryngologist (ear and
throat specialist), who can examine the ears and upper respiratory
tract. If the cause is a temporary condition, the otolaryngologist
will provide treatment. If the hearing loss seems permanent, the
child may be referred to an audiologist who can perform further
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Tests, such as auditory evoked responses (AER), can detect major
hearing impairment in babies _ before it interferes seriously with
the child's development. If there is any indication that a baby is
not hearing or hears in certain ranges but not in all, I'd suggest
a complete evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing loss may become more obvious in the second year, as a
child who is beginning to speak garbles words in a regular fashion.
I would always be aware of hearing impairment as a possibility in a
child who is not developing properly, particularly in areas of
communication.
</P>
<P>
   Otitis media (infection of the middle ear) can threaten a
child's hearing. Many infants develop a tendency to chronic otitis
media. After an acute earache, the pressure and the discharge seem
to linger despite antibiotics. Otitis media is sometimes called
glue ear _ as if the ear contained glue that was hard to mobilize.
</P>
<P>
   Chronic infection of the middle ear can cause hearing

particularly vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Ear infections may follow colds as often as every two weeks.
Each ear infection becomes more difficult to treat. Parents and
physicians get discouraged. The baby's general condition is often
affected; she seems to become rundown and vulnerable to everything.

   Following the development of speech and other forms of

</P>
<P>
   With an older child, if you are concerned about hearing, try
whispering in one ear or the other. Be sure to whisper something to
which you know she will want to respond, since there are many
periods in a child's development when ``selective attention'' can
be operating. Whisper a welcome question, such as, ``Do you want to
go to town with me?'' or ``Do you want a cookie?''
</P>
<P>
   In my office, I put my finger in one of the child's ears and
whisper in the other, ``Do you want a lollipop?'' This is almost
sure to get a response. If there are no responses and/or speech is
developing inappropriately, I refer the child for evaluation by an
otolaryngologist or testing by an audiologist.

</P>
<P>
   Parents often worry about whether or not their baby's hearing is
normal. There is certainly reason for concern. Lack of hearing can
greatly interfere with an infant's development.
</P>
<P>
   Profoundly deaf babies are slowed down in all areas. They are
likely to appear depressed and unreactive _ slow to develop motor
skills and to reward parents' attempts at interaction. They may lie
in their cribs passively, or they may develop autisms _ such as
head rolling or other repetitive behaviors _ as if to fill up empty
space.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, their other senses, such as sight and touch,
become heightened. This can make a baby hypersensitive and easily
overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are ways to test the hearing of a baby. I
find it is best to do it when she is asleep or as she is just
rousing. I use a soft rattle and a bell, in a quiet room. After
several startles, a baby with normal hearing will shut out or
ignore either of these sounds.
</P>
<P>
   A quiet room is one of the keys to this assessment. If I test a
baby in a noisy environment, she may have already shut out auditory
input. Then she can appear to be deaf, even though she's not. The
reason for the two stimuli is to test the range of her hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Another test would be to give the baby a chance to respond to my
voice when she's awake and looking at the ceiling. If she quiets
and slowly turns to my voice, I know that she hears me. If her
mother and I compete on either side of her, she should choose the
higher-pitched female voice.
</P>
<P>
   If there is concern about a baby's hearing, the primary
physician usually refers the child to an otolaryngologist (ear and
throat specialist), who can examine the ears and upper respiratory
tract. If the cause is a temporary condition, the otolaryngologist
will provide treatment. If the hearing loss seems permanent, the
child may be referred to an audiologist who can perform further
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Tests, such as auditory evoked responses (AER), can detect major
hearing impairment in babies _ before it interferes seriously with
the child's development. If there is any indication that a baby is
not hearing or hears in certain ranges but not in all, I'd suggest
a complete evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing loss may become more obvious in the second year, as a
child who is beginning to speak garbles words in a regular fashion.
I would always be aware of hearing impairment as a possibility in a
child who is not developing properly, particularly in areas of
communication.
</P>
<P>
   Otitis media (infection of the middle ear) can threaten a
child's hearing. Many infants develop a tendency to chronic otitis
media. After an acute earache, the pressure and the discharge seem
to linger despite antibiotics. Otitis media is sometimes called
glue ear _ as if the ear contained glue that was hard to mobilize.
</P>
<P>
   Chronic infection of the middle ear can cause hearing
impairment. Infants in group care or infants with older siblings in
school who are exposed to many different infections are
particularly vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Ear infections may follow colds as often as every two weeks.
Each ear infection becomes more difficult to treat. Parents and
physicians get discouraged. The baby's general condition is often
affected; she seems to become rundown and vulnerable to everything.
</P>
<P>

which you know she will want to respond, since there are many
periods in a child's development when ``selective attention'' can

   QUESTION: My 10-year-old daughter is very friendly and enjoys
playing with other kids, but she has no friends. She calls kids on
the phone, but they don't call back. She has had classmates come
over to our house, but no one invites her to theirs. She is in
extracurricular activities such as Girl Scouts and dancing class,
but she does not see anyone after these activities are over.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't complain, but I know she longs for a playmate and
friend. Any suggestions? _ L.K., Leesburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   DR. BRAZELTON: Maybe this is revealing something about your
daughter that you don't see yourself. If you could understand why
other children aren't attracted to her, you would be better able to
help her.
</P>
<P>
   When other children can't or won't relate to a child, that child
may have a deeper problem. For example, your daughter may bully
other children or try to control them because she feels insecure
herself.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, I would take this situation seriously. Consult her
teachers or a psychologist who can evaluate her. Meanwhile, try to
find your daughter a child who is like her in temperament. Woo the
other child by taking them to a museum or a movie. Try to get them
together regularly for something they can enjoy. If your daughter
can make one friend, it will be easier for the two of them to enter
a peer group _ together.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I'm a single mom of a 2-year-old son. He was 4 months
old when I left my husband and moved from Arizona to Tennessee so
that my parents could help me raise him. My ex-husband never
contacts us anymore, and I have no idea where he is living now.
</P>
<P>
   My son and I will soon be moving back to Arizona. I have always
been open with him about his daddy, telling him, ``Every child has
a mommy and a daddy; yours just lives in another state.'' But when
he gets older and starts to understand more, how do I explain to
him that his dad just couldn't handle the responsibility of raising
a child? I don't want him to think he is the reason he has no daddy
_ or blame me! _ No Name, Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   DR. BRAZELTON: You may never be able to explain it
satisfactorily to him. A child will always long for the other
parent. He is likely to blame himself (and you) for losing his
father: ``If I were a better boy, he would have never left me.''
</P>
<P>
   You need to be ready to repeatedly reassure him that his
father's abandonment had nothing to do with him. Tell him that you
and his dad couldn't make it together. You need to assume the blame
to protect him.
</P>
<P>
   You should also assure him that you will never leave him. A
child without one parent always fears the loss of the other.
</P>
<P>
   Is it necessary for you to leave your supportive family now?
Being a single parent can certainly be difficult, and it may be
hard for your son to be without an extended family or close friends
as cushions when stressful times hit.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My 10-year-old daughter is very loud when she eats or
drinks. The sound she makes is like a moaning/heavy breathing. It's
nearly impossible to get through a meal without telling her to
quiet down.
</P>
<P>
   Should I ignore this and hope she grows out of it, or keep
reminding her about it so she doesn't embarrass herself at social
functions? Could this be a health problem? _ R.T., Clinton
Township, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   DR. BRAZELTON: I am not familiar with a physical reason for her
heavy breathing at mealtimes, but I suggest that you consult her
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no physical reason for the breathing, she may be
trying to get a response out of you. If this is the case, ignoring
it is the best way to diminish it.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to let her know that others may find the heavy
breathing socially unacceptable, say that once _ and then shut up.
More pressure from you may just cause her to repeat it.

<P>
   MIAMI _ Coca-Cola may be America's most popular soft drink, yet
Orlando housewife America Vaughan(CQ both) is eager to point out
how her new soda, Havana Cola, is different.
</P>
<P>
   It has a citric taste, she says, with the distinctive touch of
Key lime. And although Havana Cola's can is red -- like Coca-Cola's
-- its shade is a candy-apple one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a different taste, and I think a better one,'' boasts
Vaughan, a 48-year-old mother of four. ``I believe once people try
it they'll pull a switcheroo.''
</P>
<P>
   If sheer exuberance were an asset, Vaughan -- who's never run a
business before -- would already be a millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   But exuberance alone may not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   By launching a new soft drink, Vaughan has taken the plunge into
the already crowded and hostile American beverage industry, one
that's filled with ample examples of prodigiousness.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers in the United States already down more soft drinks
than in any other country outside of Mexico, leaving the Coca-Cola
Co. and the Pepsi-Cola Co. battling for every smidgen of market
share they can find.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Two together enjoy more than 75 percent of market share
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And they have decades worth of advertising know-how to make sure
sales keep climbing.
</P>
<P>
   So with the average American currently drinking more than 800
servings of soda a year, industry experts doubt that the U.S.
market can yield much more growth -- unless it's at someone else's
expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``A uniquely flavored brand has the potential of getting a niche
in some regional markets, but beyond that I think the challenge
would be a herculean one,'' said John Sicher, editor of Beverage
Digest, an industry newsletter based in Bedford Hills, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are already so many soft drinks,'' he said. ``I think
people have plenty of choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Vaughan's not the type to be easily deterred.
</P>
<P>
   Since it went on the market last November, she has sold some
75,000 cans of Havana Cola. Tens of thousands more have been given
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a nice clean taste that will liberate the taste buds,
and people just love it,'' the Cuban-born Vaughan beams, ``so I
think it's going to do very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The product has started to win a faithful following in Florida,
one which Vaughan hopes will grow to include customers in several
other states.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, she scored perhaps her biggest coup yet when
Houston-based Sysco Corp., the nation's largest marketer and
distributor of food-service products, agreed to distribute Havana
Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughan is so emboldened by her product's potential that she's
striking out with another risky venture: the development of a diet
version of Havana Cola with the help of a chemist in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Dead serious, she says her goal is to earn 3 percent of the cola
market in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That's news to Atlanta-based Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, I guess I'm aware of the product, but not all that
much,'' said Cocal Cola spokeswoman Polly Howes, emphasizing,
though, that Coca-Cola welcomes any and all competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly there is plenty of room for anyone out there who
wants to get into this business,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Havana Cola's currently available at restaurants and small
grocery stores across central and south Florida, including several
in Miami and Orlando. Barnie's Coffee and Tea Co. has agreed to
sell it, as has the Latin Quarter, a new restaurant at Universal
Studios in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of the Havana restaurant in West Palm Beach, Fla.
call it their ``house soda.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The drink is selling really well,'' said Rafael Perez,
Havana's assistant owner. ``Everyone who tries it wants more.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for Havana Cola was born by happenstance in the Florida
Keys, where Vaughan and her children often vacationed in the 1980s.
While there, her brother, who didn't always like to drink alcohol,
would mix Cuba Libres minus the rum, a taste the whole family
enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always enjoyed the taste of cola and lime,'' she said.
``I thought, 'Why not share the taste with others'?''
</P>
<P>
   In her native Cuba -- which she left in the 1960s for the United
States -- cola splashed with lime juice was a popular drink.
</P>
<P>
   She spent months refining that cola-and-lime taste in her
Orlando kitchen, experimenting on friends and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, she finally felt the time was ripe to launch her own
company. She did some research at the public library and called the
U.S. Department of Commerce to find out how to register a
trademark.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughan said her son, Greg, 23, came up with the name Havana
Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were in the Floriday Keys we would see a lot of Cuban
rafters trying to make it to Florida, and so my son became very
interested in Cuba and came up with the name,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Before it can become a registered trademark, a product's name
must be published in a weekly government trademark magazine, giving
objectors a chance to notify the commerce department's patent and
trademark office.
</P>
<P>
   One early hitch developed after attorneys representing Havana
Club rum opposed registration of the name Havana Cola in early
1995, fearing consumers might be confused by the products' similar
names.
</P>
<P>
   Havana Club backed down, though, in late 1997, and Havana Cola
was registered as a trademark by August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   She was then free to sign up with a bottler, and start locating
sales outlets.
</P>
<P>
   But the road ahead will be a tough one, as even major national
brands have gone from hot to not in just a few years.
</P>
<P>
   For example, California Cooler, the brand that sparked the wine
cooler craze that spread in the 1980s, faded rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   And the industry's major players are adding new products all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has developed a host of new drinks, including a
citrus-flavored one called Surge. Royal Crown Co. has come up with
a drink called RC Edge it dubs a ``power cola'' loaded with extra
caffeine and other energy boosters.
</P>
<P>
   But far from shrinking from the challenge, Vaughan has launched
a publicity blitzkrieg in Florida that's already fomented a buzz
about her cola.
</P>
<P>
   In March, she set up a promotional booth at the popular Carnaval
Miami festival. Vaughan crowned a Miss Havana Cola at the booth, a
Colombian named Lexdiana Ortiz. In April, the cola was the featured
beverage at a three-day, dead-fish-throwing contest -- known as a
mullet toss -- near Pensacola, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The Havana Cola logo also will be featured on Ron Burkett's race
car when he competes June 19 in the Slim Jim NASCAR race at the
Lanier National Speedway in Gainesville, Ga. One of her neighbors
is a friend of Burkett's -- now a big fan of the drink.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Vaughan continues to give away free samples of Havana
Cola everywhere she can.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my belief that people's palates have a very good
memory,'' Vaughan said. ``If I give them a taste, you can bet
they'll be back for more.''

   ``We figured we'd at least get back what we paid for them,''
said Matt Albee, a Web designer in Palo Alto, Calif., who was
selling eight tickets to ``The Phantom Menace'' on the eBay
Internet auction site. ``If I don't get rid of them, I can always
give them to friends.''
</P>
<P>
   EBay and sites like it link buyers and sellers. The auction
sites are considered some of the most popular destinations on the
World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Star Wars'' fanatics have been making headlines by
camping out at box offices around the country, Albee and others
said buying tickets for Wednesday's premiere hardly required an
overnight stay on the cement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised how easy it was,'' said Albee, who bought 12
tickets without standing in line.
</P>
<P>
   Theaters have been limiting sales of tickets to 12, the better
to keep ticket resellers in check, but for amateur ``Phantom
Menace'' ticket brokers, a dozen tickets in hand is enough to turn
a tidy profit.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets to the movie, costing about $8.50 each, were going for
an average of $30 each on eBay.

INJUSTICE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In case you haven't noticed how screwed up the
world is, listen to Danny Piazza. He's a masonry contractor with a
wife and three kids, one of them just 9.
</P>
<P>
   He lives in the Albany suburb of Colonie. He and his neighbors
have a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice middle-class neighborhood,'' Piazza was telling me
the other day. ``About two weeks ago, a neighbor, whom I didn't
know, came walking by and handed me a piece of paper that said
there's a pedophile that's been released and is living virtually
across the street in the development.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked her a couple of questions. She said there's not a lot
of information available because the crime was committed prior to
'96. The police can't tell you who the guy is. They can't give you
a description _ can't even acknowledge that he's there.''
</P>
<P>
   This was cause for concern to Piazza, as it would be to most
people with kids. He knows that these guys have stunningly high
rates of recidivism. They tend to fall prey to what shrinks call
``uncontrollable urges.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why it's nice to know when they get sprung into your
neighborhood. You want to be able to warn your kids to stay away
from certain people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called the Town of Colonie,'' Piazza told me. ``I spoke to a
detective over there. He was pretty helpful except that he couldn't
talk about this. He told me to give a call to this guy at the New
York State Parole Board.''
</P>
<P>
   So Piazza called the parole board guy, who confirmed to him
that, yes, there was a paroled pedophile in his neighborhood, but
his identity is confidential. New York has a neighborhood
notification law regarding sex offenders, but it applies at the
moment only to people convicted after the law was passed. Offenders
convicted before that date have gotten an injunction to keep their
names confidential _ at least until this is fully hammered out in
the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Also, New York's version of Megan's Law _ the catchall name for
such laws derived from the name of a New Jersey victim _ permits
people to get information from the New York State Sex Offender
Hotline at 900-288-3838, but only if you already have the sex
offender's name and one other piece of information about him, like
his address or Social Security number. And, by the way, only if
you're willing to cough up five bucks for what should be free,
public information.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, though, word of these releases still gets around
sometimes, as this one did. Somebody hears just enough information
to get everybody in the neighborhood frightened and furious at a
system that's supposed to protect their kids and doesn't quite do
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody tipped off the North Colonie schools, where my son
goes,'' Piazza said. ``They heard something from somebody off the
record. They said their teachers know what this guy looks like.
They have a description of him. But they can't tell the kids
anything. They can't send a notice home because this guy has got
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Hey, that's great. Everybody knows about this guy
except the people who should know _ the children and the parents in
the neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza was told by the parole board guy that this pedophile is
considered high-risk. The parole people suspect that this guy
probably will do it again.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza said, ``I've been trying to get a picture, a name, so I
can plaster it around the neighborhood. Now I'm being told by
people who know about this stuff to let it go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I can't. My son's a prisoner in his own house when I'm
not around. It's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Yep.
</P>

BOSTON:  ...  Boston stadium. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On March 15, another key development occurred, not in New
England, but in Phoenix, where NFL owners voted to change league
policy to foster internal funding of stadium projects. Finneran
felt vindicated. And the door to bringing the Patriots back home
opened a little wider.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really a key turning point,'' Finneran said
recently.``It meant the league might be willing to participate. And
it was a tacit acceptance of what the House had argued all along:
that those who stood to benefit from a new stadium, like the NFL
owners, also had to participate in funding it.''
</P>
<P>
   A month later, the Boston group -- now consisting of Kirk,
Monan, Boston Edison chairman Thomas J. May, Budd, and Connell --
began crafting an opinion piece to be published in the Globe. The
draft, articulating broad backing for keeping the team, was
circulated on Beacon Hill in advance so leaders would not be
stunned when they opened their papers April 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest is history,'' Kirk said. ``This thing just
unfolded.''
</P>
<P>
   The article triggered strong statements of support, most
importantly from Beacon Hill, and unexpectedly positive statements
from the mayor saying he was open-minded. Privately, though, it
soon became clear Menino still did not want a stadium in Boston, so
the group began focusing on Foxborough, the Patriots' base since
1971.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Birmingham, the Senate president and a former labor
negotiator, called Kirk at home, urging a face-to-face summit on
Beacon Hill the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way I figured we might be able to get this done was
to all sit down in the same room and hammer it out,'' Birmingham
said. ``So that's what we proposed.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It all came together, quite literally in the 11th hour _ on
Tuesday, April 27, at 11:35 p.m., to be exact.
</P>
<P>
   The state's power troika emerged from a three-hour meeting with
a plan that could upend everything the team planned and Hartford's
dream of becoming an NFL city.
</P>
<P>
   The seed planted by Kirk and Rooney nearly five months earlier
had sprouted in this cluster of leadership gathered in Birmingham's
cavernous office, paneled with Honduran Mahogany and draped in
patinated yellow and green fabric.
</P>
<P>
   At one end of the 12-foot antique table sat the House speaker,
Finneran. Birmingham sat at the other. Seated on blue-leather
chairs between them were Kirk, Governor Cellucci, Lieutenant
Governor Jane Swift, aides to all three political leaders,
stadium-expert Goodell, and another NFL executive, Neil Glat.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second night in a row the group had met in
Birmingham's office. The first evening, there was a lot of
posturing. By the second night, it was clear everyone was working
toward a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Except there was a sticking point: Finneran's demand that the
Patriots pay up to $2 million a year to cover some of the state's
costs for road, sewer, and other public infrastructure work
required at a new Foxboro Stadium. NFL officials balked, noting
that should be the state's responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   A tense standoff ensued, and for a few minutes it looked like
the deal could die.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by the impasse, Cellucci, a strong supporter of a new
stadium for the Patriots, sided with Finneran. Still, NFL officials
insisted they couldn't agree to the payback language. To keep the
momentum of the talks going, Birmingham asked Kirk and the NFL men
to wait in another room while the three political leaders discussed
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   After about 30 minutes, they were invited back in, presented
with the the final plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a general feeling that this was it,'' Birmingham
said later. ``The deal was as good as it was going to get.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL signed on.
</P>
<P>
   Under the offer, drafted into the legislation that passed
Tuesday, Kraft would build the stadium, partially assisted by
low-rate NFL financing. The state would provide $70 million in
infrastructure improvements around Route 1. Further, Kraft would
grant an easement on his land, allowing the state to upgrade access
ramps and sewer lines on his private property.
</P>
<P>
   Several people involved in the negotiations claim credit for the
easement plan. But whoever promoted the idea, it broke the
stalemate by eliminating the land purchase component of the
Senate's last plan, which Finneran opposed, while preserving
infrastructure spending that the team deemed necessary.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Massachusetts moved closer to a counteroffer, Connecticut
fell behind.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, on Thursday, April 29, a team of Patriots
consultants delivered a prognosis that put the Hartford deal in
critical condition: the stadium, they concluded, most likely could
not be ready by 2002, as promised, because it would take longer to
clear the site of the steam plant and scrub it of environmental
contamination. Under the stadium contract, that was enough for the
team to walk away without penalty, as long as it made the decision
by the upcoming Sunday, May 2.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft faced a choice: wait at least another year for the
Hartford stadium or take his chances in Massachusetts, where a plan
was now on the table but had not received full legislative
approval.
</P>
<P>
   That night, Kraft, his son Jonathan, and team executive Andy
Wasynczuk flew to Hartford to see if a third option was possible:
Would Connecticut extended the penalty-free deadline another month,
by which time a more definitive review of the site could be
completed?
</P>
<P>
   Rowland refused. Mostly, the governor couldn't believe the team
would really turn their backs on a free stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a game of high stakes poker'' said one person who was
in the room.``And I think the governor was calling the team's
bluff.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, furious and desperate, gave Kraft just 24 hours to
decide _ even though Kraft legally had several days to make up his
mind. The meeting ended. They all left the governor's office to
face a throng of reporters camped outside and issued sober, but
vague, statements about being committed to their ``goal'' of the
Patriots playing in Hartford by 2002. They shook hands as cameras
clicked and went their separate ways.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a final parting.
</P>
<P>
   Consultants for both sides stayed up well into Friday morning,
trying to salvage the agreement, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, the Krafts got a final consultants' report.
</P>
<P>
   With a void of good news, Robert Kraft retreated to his office
on the 34th floor of a Boston skyscraper to fax the formal
termination notice to Connecticut. He called Rowland as it was
being transmitted.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Kraft and Wasynczuk left the room. It was a painful and
emotional conversation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, in Los Angeles promoting Massachusetts film
production, was chatting with renowned chef Wolfgang Puck, about to
make a cheese, tomato, and pepper pizza, when news of the stunning
about-face broke.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, Cellucci would be on the set of ``The Tonight
Show.'' Jay Leno, originally from the Boston area, gave a nod to
the governor during his opening monologue, asking him what was
happening with the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   The camera, beaming the program to some 6 million viewers, spun
around toward the audience where Cellucci sat smiling with his
thumb in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're staying,'' the governor shouted, ``in Massachusetts!''

REPORT CITES VULNERABILITY OF RUSSIAN NUCLEAR MATERIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nuclear materials that could be used to build bombs are spread
throughout locations in Russia, and the security systems in place
to guard them are more vulnerable than had been previously
estimated, according to a new report issued Tuesday by the National
Research Council.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the report said, despite efforts in recent years to
address these problems, there is not even a reliable inventory of
the weapons-grade uranium and plutonium in Russia, making it
impossible to know whether any has been stolen or moved out of the
country. The independent group recommends a minimum expenditure of
$725 million over five years to continue a joint US-Russian program
to analyze and address the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although joint efforts by Russia and the United States have
strengthened security at many sites,'' said Richard Meserve, head
of the committee that prepared the report, ``we believe that
terrorist groups or rogue nations have more opportunity to gain
access to Russian plutonium and highly enriched uranium than
previously estimated.''
</P>
<P>
   Some progress has been made, the committee said. For example,
protection systems in several buildings where the materials are
stored have been greatly improved, and hundreds of kilograms of the
material that had been widely distributed has been consolidated
into fewer sites, making security more manageable.
</P>
<P>
   But, the group added, Russia's recent financial woes have
produced such hardship for many officials, nuclear specialists and
workers who have access to the sites that there is now an ``added
incentive for materials to be stolen or sold illegally.''
</P>
<P>
   At some facilities, the report said, guards have not been paid
for months and have not been given adequate food or clothing for
outside patrols.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the report estimated, about 1,350 metric tons of
plutonium and highly enriched uranium are located in many different
kinds of facilities throughout Russia. About half is already in the
form of nuclear weapons, and the remainder is in a variety of
different forms, including scrap material. One suitcase full of
either material would be sufficient to make a nuclear bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The committee analyzed only the non-weapons material. Among
their recommendations: Consolidate the material into fewer
buildings to improve security; support Russian organizations to
build up that nation's ability to better manage its stockpiles;
complete a thorough accounting of the material now in Russia to
allow it to be tracked; and devise ways of protecting large
quantities of spent nuclear fuel left over from naval uses and
experimental reactors.
</P>
<P>
   The National Research Council is a private, nonprofit
institution chartered by the US Congress to provide independent
advice on matters of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
   The panel said the government has requested $145 million for
fiscal 2000 to continue a joint program to improve the security for
these materials, and strongly recommended that funding be
maintained at that level for at least the next five years, and at
``adequate'' levels thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   With greater access to Russian nuclear facilities, the report
said, ``the US government has identified more extensive dispersion
of material and more pervasive inadequacies of protection systems
than had been anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, it concluded, ``the gravity of the threat has
increased.''

REPORT ON SPRAWL RAISES HABITAT CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- As Massachusetts loses 44 acres a day to development,
efforts to protect open space have accelerated recently, but barely
one-sixth of the state can be called truly protected wildlife
habitat, according to a new Massachusetts Audubon Society report.
</P>
<P>
   While the study reiterates now-common fears that Massachusetts
is losing swaths of countryside to sprawl, one of its more
innovative features is scrutinizing the quality of so-called
protected open space _ much of which turns out to include prison
yards, covered landfills, golf courses and other
less-than-truly-natural areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is talking about the value of the land we're losing,''
said John J. Clarke, advocacy director for the society.
Environmentalists and state officials have perhaps been overly
focused on a ``numbers game'' of boosting acres of land publicly
owned, rather than focusing on protecting natural habitats, Clarke
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to do a better job of convincing people that it's
important to buy land for functional wildlife habitats, not just
for soccer fields,'' Clarke said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the report found that 23.8 percent of the state's 3.76
million acres of land has been developed, up from 15 percent in
1971 and 20 percent in 1985. Most of the growth is coming from
demand for houses, malls and office parks on Cape Cod, in
southeastern Massachusetts and the lower Connecticut River Valley,
and booming exurban communities along Interstate 495.
</P>
<P>
   But while state and federal agencies count 40 percent of the
state as protected open space, the Audubon study contends that no
more than 17.3 percent should really be counted as what it calls
``truly protected wildlife habitat.''
</P>
<P>
   The 40 percent figure includes land that has been altered in
ways that may threaten native animals and plants, and includes
sections of military bases, covered landfills, school campuses,
prison yards, amusement parks, ski areas and golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   It also includes land subject to what the society considers
less-than-permanent protection, including nearly 270,000 acres
under Chapter 61 agriculture, conservation or forestry arrangements
that provide a temporary local tax break for the owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all open space is equally valuable or healthy habitat; not
all developed land is equally degraded,'' study author Jennifer
Steele wrote. ``Not all protection is equal or equally effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Clarke said, protected wildlife habitat areas tend to
be highly fragmented and ``in some areas like a museum inside a
fence,'' rather than continuous areas that can support a natural
ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   For conservation advocates, the report does show some positive
trends. The annual rate of conversion of land in the state has
dropped from 21,000 acres a year in the mid-1980s to about 16,000
acres per year recently.
</P>
<P>
   Also, from 1988 to 1997, land has been formally protected for
wildlife habitat 48 percent faster than it has been developed, a
rate the society acknowledged is ``high and should be lauded.''
</P>
<P>
   James C. Dougherty, president of the 15,000-member Massachusetts
Association of Realtors, said he was surprised that the Audubon
report found that less than a quarter of the state has been
developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us live in communities that are being built up faster
than we might like,'' Dougherty said, but the solution lies in
better local planning and land conservation efforts based on broad,
locally approved taxes rather than taxes only on home sales.
</P>
<P>
   However, given projections showing Massachusetts will continue
to gain population over the next 25 years, Dougherty said, ``If you
don't have new construction, you're going to have a lot of people
living in the street. . . . The key is managing growth so that it
is done intelligently and properly.''
</P>
<P>
   State Environmental Affairs Secretary Robert A. Durand has begun
developing ``build-out analyses'' for all 351 cities and towns in
Massachusetts to show local officials how much development could
occur under their current zoning codes, with more than 20 such
studies completed in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   After the state last year met a goal of preserving 100,000 acres
of land during the 1990s, Governor Paul Cellucci set as a state
goal preserving another 200,000 acres of open space by 2010.
Cellucci's new goal includes not just additions to state forests
and parks but nonprofit nature preserves and agreements by
landowners and farmers not to develop their land.

<P>
   The Yankees are in town, but Don Zimmer isn't managing and Roger
Clemens isn't pitching. Those boys from the Bronx simply have no
sense of drama. None at all.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening farewell for a now-officially-moribund Fenway
Park, the Yanks Tuesday night lost to Pedro Martinez, 6-3, and fell
into second place behind the surging Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   It was especially painful for New Yorkers because the fall from
first came on the night of Joe Torre's return to the bench. It
seems poor Joe just can't keep the Bombers on top the way Zim did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt very good, very calm,'' Torre said after the game, his
first since he was sidelined with prostate cancer during spring
training. ``There was no stress for me tonight. The only thing I
had to be careful of was my hands. I didn't want to reach up and
scratch something and all of a sudden there'd be some guy running
to second base.''
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner watched from his box next to the Yankee
dugout and was in Torre's office after the frustrating defeat. He
did not look particularly happy after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the loss, there was nonstop action on the visitors'
side of the field. Noble Torre was back in the corner office, Zim
was on the bench, holding a fungo bat, officially done as manager
(itals)for the last time.(unitals) Meanwhile, the Rocket was
meeting behind closed doors with Torre, general manager Brian
Cashman was again proving to be the exact opposite of Dan Duquette
(read: accessible), and Steinbrenner was sitting in Box 65-D of a
near-empty Fenway discussing Torre, Zimmer, Clemens, old Fenway,
new Fenway, and his days running track for Williams in the old
Boston Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Whew. All that and we hadn't even seen Pedro (11 more strikeouts
and 136 pitches) yet.
</P>
<P>
   The return of Torre qualifies as one of the feel-good stories of
the spring. The perfect manager for this near-perfect team, Torre
was diagnosed early in spring training and left the team for
surgery and recuperation.
</P>
<P>
   In Torre's absence, the Yankees turned to Zimmer, who honored
his friend by leaving the manager's office chair empty and refusing
the front-row seat on the team bus and airplane.
</P>
<P>
   All the Yankees had faith that Torre was coming back sometime
this summer, and the decision was made while the manager and his
wife had dinner at home Monday night. Torre called Steinbrenner
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``George kept saying, `Are you sure; are you sure?' '' said
Torre. ``He was flying today, getting in around two, so I asked him
if he could go a little earlier and we'd fly together.''
</P>
<P>
   They did. Torre was in the Yankee clubhouse by mid-afternoon.
The first players he saw were Jeff Nelson and Joe Girardi. And he
saw Zim. The infamous former Sox manager has been getting to the
park early for 51 years, and Tuesday was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer wasn't doing any formal interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm done with that,'' said the man who steered the S.S.
Steinbrenner for two months. ``I'm just a bench coach.''
</P>
<P>
   There's speculation in Yankeeland that Zimmer might quit. He has
been hobbled by a bum knee and threatened to retire once Torre
returned. His threats are sometimes ignored because he's retired a
couple of times already. The lovable Zim has become like the
neighborhood barkeep who gets into a snit with management and quits
every other weekend, only to return on Monday. He might be serious
this time. His knee is a legitimate pain, and it's no secret that
he feels unappreciated by the Boss.
</P>
<P>
   Sox fans were denied the delicious prospect of watching Zim
march out with the lineup card, but that's not as regrettable as
the Yankees' decision to bring Clemens off the disabled list Friday
in Chicago rather than Thursday at Fenway. Torre took credit/blame
for the decision, just as John McNamara didn't take the blame for
removing Clemens from Game 6 in '86.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the Rocket was magnificently obtuse, even by the
lofty standards he set during his 12-year Boston career. As if
trained in the Duquette school of no-pulse nonspeak, Clemens said
it made no difference whether he pitched here or at the new
Comiskey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I badly want to pitch, but we're just looking at the big
picture,'' said Clemens. ``There's no more distractions here than I
have when I pitch in Texas. I'm sure I'll pitch here again.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Rog. Does that mean you'll stare at the Jerry Reinsdorf
luxury box when you walk off the field after fanning 16 White Sox
Friday night?
</P>
<P>
   For New Yorkers, the bottom line is that the Yankees are whole
again. They have their trusty manager, they'll soon have another
ace, and Boston's flirtation with first should be brief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Torre is a player's manager,'' said the respectful Derek
Jeter. ``There's a calmness when he's around. Nothing seems to faze
him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a couple of months since things seemed normal,''
said Girardi. ``Joe's our leader, and we're accustomed to seeing
Joe in the leader's chair.''
</P>
<P>
   Proving that courage and class supersede even the polarizing
passion of the Red Sox-Yankee rivalry, many Fenway fans stood and
applauded madly when Torre brought out the lineup card before the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was moving,'' said the manager. ``I didn't want to take the
lineup card out, but I asked my bench coach (Zimmer) and he told me
I should take it out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre said his comeback had nothing to do with Boston and was
not expedited by New York's mid-May free-fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been taking my daughter to arts and crafts every
Tuesday,'' said Torre. ``My wife took her (yesterday), and I think
that was OK with her. I was happy to be going back to work. This is
where I want to be. We've created something special here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been ready for about a week. I'd been thinking about
coming back sometime during this series. So (Tuesday) morning I
called Zim and told him, `Are you ready to do the job you were
hired to do?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer was ready. George was ready. Roger was (almost) ready.
And the Yankees should be ready to resume the dominance that marked
their 1999 season under the steady hand of Torre.
</P>
<P>
   Now they just have to get climb over the first-place Red Sox.

VENTURE CAPITAL: INTERNET SPEEDS MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pressure was on. The venture capitalists at Highland Capital
Partners were eyeing BeFree Inc., a promising Internet start-up in
Marlborough, Mass. that had come to their attention just three days
before. Normally, partners of the Boston venture firm would take up
to four weeks to check out the entrepreneur, his business plan and
his references, often in face-to-face meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But other venture capitalists were ready to rain money on
BeFree. So the four partners of Highland had to move quickly: They
canceled all their appointments and spent just a day on the phone
evaluating their prospect. Within 48 hours, Highland committed $10
million to BeFree and its founder, Gordon Hoffstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it `fire drill' due diligence,'' chuckles Paul A.
Maeder, managing general partner. ``If we didn't act quickly we
would have lost the deal. There's a frenzy out there with Internet
start-ups we have never seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the frenetic new world of venture capital. The
financiers who have traditionally bankrolled promising technology
start-ups are throwing out many of the old rules of venture
investing to keep up with the Internet gold rush.
</P>
<P>
   With on-line ventures cropping up all over, the money men of
high tech are adopting a new code of behavior that matches what
some would call the ``irrational exuberance'' of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists are moving at warp speed, making decisions
in hours and days instead of weeks and months. Attention to profit
is being jettisoned in favor of fast growth for their portfolio
companies. Product technology, once the main reason for investing
in a young company, is taking a back seat to marketing and creating
a brand name for an Internet venture.
</P>
<P>
   The financiers are betting larger sums, up to $50 million on a
single Internet prospect, compared to less than $30 million for a
computer hardware firm just six years ago, for instance. Naturally,
with more money and higher risks, venture capitalists are looking
for quicker payoffs from their investments by either selling the
company or taking it public within 24 months instead of the
traditional three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   Given Wall Street's fervor for Internet stocks, venture
capitalists, like many investors, are looking to strike while the
market is still hot. The scramble to get in on the most promising
deals has prompted some of the most daring venture capitalists to
commit $5 million or more to a single on-line company after a mere
two-hour meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet start-ups today are a once in a lifetime
opportunity,'' says Jonathan Flint, general partner of Polaris
Venture Partners, a three-year old Waltham, Mass. venture capital
that has invested in more than a dozen Internet-related companies.
``While Amazon.com, Netscape, e-Bay, and a few others have the
mother lode, there is still some adjoining acreage where you can
mine for gold _ and that's what we are after.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Internet is seizing a bigger and bigger share of the
venture capital pie. Overall, a whopping $13.7 billion was invested
last year in 2,023 high technology and biomedical companies
nationwide, according to Technologic Partners' Venture Finance, a
publication that tracks venture spending. Nearly half of the
companies were Internet-related. In 1997, 627 deals captured $2.5
billion in venture funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a a land grab and there are no signs of an
Internet investment slowdown,'' says Richard A. Shaffer, Venture
Finance editor and publisher. ``The Internet is so central to
investing that many venture capital firms have stopped doing life
science and health care deals. Why spend a decade going through
clinical trials and federal approvals when you can launch an
Internet company that the public may buy?''
</P>
<P>
   But some worry that venture capitalists may be throwing caution
to the winds. Their hefty bets in small companies that are years
from profitability could backfire, particularly if Internet stocks
tumble on Wall Street and dampen the overall market for on-line
ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the ``.com'' fever that has struck the venture community
has made a big difference to entrepreneurs looking for money.
</P>
<P>
   Stig Leschly, founder of Exchange.com, for instance, raised
venture money in less than six weeks. Exchange.com, which runs Web
sites that bring buyers and sellers of antique books and old music
recordings together, got $12 million in venture capital, including
$4.5 million from Polaris.
</P>
<P>
   He and his investors found out how quickly they could hit the
jackpot. Just seven months after Leschly formed the Cambridge,
Mass. company, Exchange.com was snapped up by Amazon.com for more
than $200 million, even though Exchange.com in the first quarter
lost $1.2 million on revenues of only $173,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has happened very quickly,'' says Leschly, 29, who
will relocate his company to Amazon.com's Seattle headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   And with scores of Internet ventures being formed monthly, some
venture capitalists are quick to switch investments if they
perceive another on-line company can get to market first.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Polaris did after spending $250,000 to form
Netconnects, a start-up in Sunnyvale, Calif., that planned to put
classified advertisements on the World Wide Web. After learning
that another company, Classifieds 2000 of Santa Clara, Calif., had
the same idea but was about four months ahead in developing its
service, Polaris abandoned Netconnects and invested $1.5 million in
Classifieds 2000 instead. The payoff came in April 1998, when
Classified 2000 was acquired by Excite.com for nearly $50 million
in Excite.com stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Classified 2000 could get bigger very quickly and give us
branding _ name recognition _ plus we could also sell it very
quickly,'' explains Flint.
</P>
<P>
   Besides making decisions faster, venture capitalists have
adopted new rules for the Internet age. They used to nurture
start-ups through many years and rounds of financing, guiding a
company to profits before taking it public. Now, the Internet
corporate motto seems to be ``Get big fast; profits can wait.'' And
since most on-line companies provide a service rather than make a
product, technology is overshadowed by the marketing quest for ever
more ``eyeballs.''
</P>
<P>
   For Desh Deshpande, the founder of Cascade Communications Corp.,
one of the state's most successful telecommunications companies of
the 1990s, the rapid financing of electronic commerce companies is
strikingly different from the funding of high-tech manufacturing
companies like Cascade, which received venture financing in the
early 1990's before going public in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are used to building revenues and profits, so valuing a
company based on eyeballs . . . is a very different concept,'' says
Deshpande, who now runs Sycamore Networks Inc., a
telecommunications business in Chelmsford.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, venture capitalist firms are hustling to taking on
more deals. Polaris, for instance, has backed more than a dozen
electronic commerce and Internet software companies _ including
Exchange.com, Wrenchead.com of Armonk, N.Y., an on-line auto parts
business headed by Gus Conrales, and Crimson Solutions of Boston, a
Web-based job search service for college students and recent
graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the days when a venture partner launched two start-ups
a year, spending 60 to 90 days to evaluate deals. Several venture
capitalists said they each expect to finance and oversee a half
dozen Internet deals this year, making financing decisions in less
than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists are finding that the entrepreneur and his
management team are often far younger but more business-savvy than
some of the engineers who founded earlier generations of technology
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing founders of Internet companies who are very
bright, generally under 35, who are knowledgeable about consumer
marketing. We would not have seen that five years ago,'' says
Robert F. Higgins, a Highland managing general partner, noting that
the Internet has prompted young executive talent to forgo the
corporate ladder for a chance to become an entreprenuer.
</P>
<P>
   Among the youngest local entreprenurs is 23-year-old Wellie
Chao, who formed Crimson Solutions with two schoolmates while
attending Harvard College. His company's Web site,
``eRecruiting.com'' enables students and alumni of nearly 60
colleges to search on line for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   At 46, Gordon Hoffstein of BeFree is among the older leaders of
an Internet company. His ability to get a quick financial
commitment from Highland stemmed in large part from his successful
track record launching two previous companies: MicroAmerica, a
computer hardware distributor, and PCs Compleat, a mail-order
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1991, I got venture financing for PCs Compleat, but it took
about six months. Now with so much investment money available, not
only is it a lot easier . . . but the competition . . . favors the
entrepreneur, something we have not seen before.''

 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY AND MEG VAILLANCOURT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- It took just one day to debate and approve a bill that
will keep the New England Patriots in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday's vote may never have happened if a couple of old
friends had not bumped into each other in a Washington hotel
ballroom last December _ an encounter that sparked a nearly
six-month campaign to keep the team from moving to Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   At a dinner honoring Nobel Peace Prize winners David Trimble and
John Hume, Boston attorney Paul G. Kirk Jr., former chairman of the
Democratic National Committee, spotted his pal, Pittsburgh Steelers
president Daniel Rooney, an outspoken critic of National Football
League franchises leaving their home markets for smaller ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went over and gave him a little tease about the NFL
referees'' making bad calls, said Kirk, one of more than two dozen
people interviewed for this story. ``He said, `Well, what are you
going to do about getting the Patriots to go back to
Massachusetts?' We talked about it a little bit, the dismay...''
</P>
<P>
   ``It did go from there,'' Rooney said, referring to the mostly
secret efforts that resulted in Tuesday's legislation being
forwarded to Governor Paul Cellucci for his signature. ``I will
admit that.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, at a meeting of a small group of NFL owners
in Chicago, Rooney listened as team owner Robert Kraft chronicled
the Patriots three-year quest for a new stadium. Blocked from
building in Boston itself, the team flirted with Providence while
Massachusetts legislators argued into a dead end over a proposal
Kraft and Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham had put together.
Then, Connecticut came acourting.
</P>
<P>
   Rooney was stupefied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know business guys in Boston,'' Rooney reportedly said, his
mind reverting back to his talk with Kirk. ``And I know they don't
want this to happen.... I really can't imagine they will let this
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Hartford looked like a done deal on Nov. 19, when Kraft
stood in the ornate Judiciary Room of Connecticut's Capitol,
signing a ``memorandum of understanding'' with Governor John G.
Rowland. The document was a plan to move the team from the one of
the oldest stadiums in the nation to a new one in downtown
Hartford, centerpiece of a $1 billion rejuvenation project for the
ailing insurance city.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft, there with his son, Jonathan, had tears in his eyes.
Although he felt welcomed by the cheering crowd and pleased with
what would be the richest deal ever offered an NFL team, sadness
and disappointment at leaving his home state were also evident on
his face.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Dec. 15 _ days after the Kirk-Rooney encounter _ the
Connecticut General Assembly passed legislation authorizing $374
million for a stadium, public infrastructure, and maintenance of
the facility, where the state university's football squad would
also play.
</P>
<P>
   But Rooney and Kirk, longtime friends through Irish charity
circles, were already working the phones. The Steelers president
started with NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue, along with Roger
Goodell, the league's stadium expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I talked to Father Monan next,'' Rooney said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. J. Donald Monan, the chancellor of Boston College who
helped broker the FleetCenter deal, was a significant force among
the widening group of mostly Irish Catholic executives trying to
spread the faith that the Patriots could be saved for the Bay
State. He gave Rooney some names of people to call, including
advertising executive John J. Connors Jr. and industrialist William
F. Connell, both of whom would become part of the inner core of
civic leaders _ known as ``Operation Team Back'' _ rallying the
business community to purchase luxury seating if and when a new
stadium got built.
</P>
<P>
   Equally significant, Monan bestowed inspiration for what seemed
like an impossible feat at that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Father Monan was very important, giving me encouragement that
it could be done. I have a lot of respect for him,'' added Rooney,
whose son attended Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk, soft-spoken, persuasive, and once considered for the NFL
commissioner's job _ which ultimately went to his friend Tagliabue
_ had also sprung into action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Paul Tagliabue. I remember saying, `You know, I'm
glad to be helpful, but no one wants to embark on a fool's errand.'
''
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner assured Kirk that developing a Massachusetts
alternative would be worthwhile. And by Jan. 6, Goodell was in
Boston, where Kirk introduced him to the civic group in his
Sullivan &AMP; Worcester law office.
</P>
<P>
   Goodell, with a background in economics and business, was
responsible for getting stadiums built from Seattle to Tampa.
However, this deal would not be as easy as the rest.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Kraft's accord with Rowland prohibited the owner
from talking with another state. That meant Operation Team Back
would have to pull together a proposal without consulting the team,
something they insist they did to prevent exposing Kraft to a
lawsuit by Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Second, there was the seemingly intractable position of House
Speaker Thomas M. Finneran. The Mattapan Democrat refused to
compromise on Senate legislation last year offering as much as $20
million for land and $52 million for infrastructure improvements
around Foxboro Stadium, ultimately halting legislative action and
pushing a tired and frustrated Kraft into Connecticut's hungry
grasp.
</P>
<P>
   But as the son of Charles E. Goodell, the US Senator from New
York who replaced the assassinated Robert F. Kennedy, Roger Goodell
understood politics. And he knew navigating them would be key to an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   So at their first meeting, Goodell quoted local favorite Tip
O'Neill as saying: ``There's always a solution if you give other
people credit for it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But many factors contributed to the turn of events, including
missteps and overconfidence on Connecticut's part and the NFL's
growing concern about franchises being lured to smaller cities with
stadium bait. Within a month of that state's approval for an
open-air facility, there were signs -- some public and some private
-- of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   At their January Super Bowl press conferences, Tagliabue and
Gene Upshaw, head of the NFL Players Association, made it clear
they weren't thrilled about the Patriots' proposed move. Hartford's
smaller television market would mean less broadcast revenue shared
among the teams.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Kraft was starting to hear that clearing the
Hartford site of a steam plant would be more complicated than
Rowland had let on.
</P>
<P>
   So he paid a visit to the freshly reelected governor.
</P>
<P>
   Behind closed doors at Rowland's gubernatorial mansion in
January, Kraft made it clear he was worried about meeting a 2002
season opening after already extending the original 2001 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   As a fire crackled in the background, Rowland looked Kraft in
the eye and said he was putting his best people on the project. He
said the state would meet the goal. Indeed, the young Republican
governor was so confident, he gave the team an easy escape: If, by
May 2, the team did not feel the stadium could be completed on time
and within budget, the Patriots could walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy is a charming, big-picture guy who thinks the people
around him are competent enough to handle the details,'' one
Connecticut lobbyist said of Rowland. ``I don't think he was well
served and hasn't been for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some outside Rowland's inner core have been calling the
Connecticut site crew the ``Junior Varsity Squad,'' a well-meaning
group ill-equipped to handle a project of such complication and
magnitude. It took them months to figure out a way to clear the
steam plant -- responsible for heating and cooling most of downtown
Hartford -- and environmental tests had still not been completed.
</P>
<P>
   All of that made outsiders smell weakness with the deal even as
Rowland and Kraft remained publicly committed to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Boston group began quietly visiting key
officials, including Finneran and Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino,
who had vehemently opposed Kraft's previous plan for a South Boston
stadium.

DIVIDED PARLIAMENT SHADOWS BARAK VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The morning after winning a landslide victory,
Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak prayed at Jerusalem's
Western Wall, the spiritual center of Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, he laid a wreath at the grave of former Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin, now a secular shrine to Barak's mentor, who
was assassinated by a Jewish extremist opposed to his vision of
peace.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's visit Tuesday to these two sites symbolized his effort
to move forward on peace and to heal the deep rift between Israel's
secular and religious Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's voting was a mandate for Barak personally, but it
underscored a widening gulf between Israelis who envision a secular
democracy and the ultra-Orthodox who insist on a religious state.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday it was already clear that the bitter divisions will
present the first test of Barak's vows to form a strong coalition
government of unity and change, and could undermine his ability to
run the country effectively if he fails to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Both camps, the secular and the ultra-Orthodox, dramatically
increased their strength in Israel's 120-member parliament. And, at
this moment, each refuses to sit in a government with the other.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful ultra-Orthodox Shas Party, mostly first- and
second-generation North African immigrants, made gains in the
election, increasing its representation in the parliament from 10
seats to 17.
</P>
<P>
   That means Shas has only two seats fewer than the established
Likud Party which was headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
until his, and the party's, defeat Monday. Likud lost more than
one-third of its 32 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Shas party leader, Aryeh Deri, has stunned Israel's
establishment with his success in empowering Israel's Sephardim,
Jewish immigrants from North Africa and Arab states. Deri is a
classic political boss who has provided services for his
constituents, much as James Michael Curley did for Boston's Irish.
And like Curley, he has had trouble with the law.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Deri was sentenced to four years in prison for
corruption, bribery and fraud. He has portrayed himself as a victim
of trumped-up charges from a judicial system controlled by the
elite intent on stopping his effort to help the Sephardic
underclass. Tuesday, he said he would step down from the leadership
of the party to ``reflect on the social and spiritual fiber'' of
the party while he awaits an appeal on his case.
</P>
<P>
   But many saw a deal in the making. Israel's TV and radio news
broadcasts were buzzing Tuesday with the possiblity that Barak may,
now that Deri has stepped down, invite Shas into his coalition,
recognizing that Shas's new power was a force to be reckoned with.
The rumors infuriated the secular left, which worked hard to elect
Barak in large part because of his promise to end the
disproportionate influence of the ultra-Orthodox in Netanyahu's
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will drive the left crazy, but bringing Shas into the
coalition cannot be ruled out,'' said Daniel Ben-Simone, who writes
on ethnic and religious politics for Israel's leading newspaper,
Ha'aretz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak knows he needs the rabbis to put a blessing on the peace
process, or he will not be able to get it through,'' said
Ben-Simone.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts were dismissive, saying it was a trial balloon by
Barak's camp. Many said they believed Barak was more likely to
bring members of the weakened Likud Party into his coalition to
build unity.
</P>
<P>
   As political analyst Zeev Chafetz put it, ``Deri is the third
rail of Israeli politics; anyone who touches him gets burned. It
just happened to Netanyahu. So Barak would be stupid to bring him
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Another ascendant party is called Change, whose leader Yosef
``Tommy'' Lapid, a veteran journalist, staked out a new ground in
Israeli politics by fashioning a message that was harshly
anti-religious. Not represented in the outgoing Knesset, Change won
six seats in the election.
</P>
<P>
   The far-left party Meretz won nine seats and has also bitterly
opposed the surging influence of the ultra-Orthodox in politics.
The two parties reflected a strong sentiment among secular voters.
</P>
<P>
   Change's Lapid said, ``I want to be minister of justice, there
is too much ultra-Orthodox influence on our justice system. If
Barak invites Shas into the coalition, we will stay in opposition.
. . . We will see it as a betrayal, a deep betrayal.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Michael Melchior, who was elected to a seat in the
parliament on Barak's One Israel list of candidates, stood by Barak
Tuesday at the Western Wall.
</P>
<P>
   Melchior has become an ambassador for Barak's spirit of
inclusion for the religious in the traditionally secular Labor
party. ``One Israel wants to find a new basis for dialogue between
the religious and the secular,'' he said. ``We want to end the
religious arm twisting.''

HONG KONG SEEKS CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW IN MIGRANT CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In what critics are calling the worst threat to Hong
Kong's autonomy since the former British colony was returned to
China in 1997, the local government plans to ask Beijing to
reinterpret the territory's constitution to block a flood of
migrants from mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa and his Cabinet say they had no
choice but to ask China to override a Hong Kong supreme court
ruling granting residency to all mainland-born children of Hong
Kong residents _ including illegitimate children and children born
before their parents gained citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Tung will ask Beijing to throw out the court ruling and narrow
residency rights to children born after their parents became
residents, a move that the government says would cut those eligible
to 200,000, from 1.67 million. Tung's announcement followed a
three-week government drumbeat of doomsday predictions if Hong Kong
were forced to accommodate a tidal wave of new arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's legal community and opposition legislators decried
the decision, calling it a violation of Hong Kong's judicial
independence. Tung's request to Beijing makes a mockery of the
Court of Final Appeal, the supreme court, and opens the door for
the government to reject any court ruling it dislikes, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the government is doing is to teach the five judges a
lesson for not ruling in their favor,'' said Martin Lee, chairman
of the opposition Democratic Party and a prominent lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a move,'' he said, ``would cause untold damage to the
rule of law, the independence of the judiciary, the `one
country-two systems' arrangement and the so-called `high degree of
autonomy' Hong Kong is supposed to enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``one country-two systems'' model promises capitalist Hong
Kong autonomy from communist China on all matters other than
defense and foreign affairs. Under the Basic Law, Hong Kong's
postcolonial constitution, the former colony was allowed to retain
its British legal system, and its Court of Final Appeal was to be
the final arbiter of law.
</P>
<P>
   The government insists the request is an exceptional case and in
the best interest of Hong Kong, which could not afford a projected
25 percent increase in its 6.8 million population over the next 13
years. The government has said taxpayers would have to spend $92
billion for new infrastructure and $4 billion annually for social
services to accommodate the new arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is only on such extraordinary issues that we take such
unusual steps,'' Tung said. ``Truly, Hong Kong cannot accept such a
huge population growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the government has inflated the figures of people
eligible for residency to scare the public. If the government's
survey is accurate, 692,000 people would be immediately eligible to
move here, but 20 percent of people surveyed said they did not
expect their mainland-born children to come.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong already accepts 150 mainland immigrants a day.
Accommodating all of the newly eligible people in a timely manner,
however, would require raising the quota to a number somewhere
between several hundred and 1,000 a day, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has repeatedly said in recent months that it would
prefer Hong Kong to settle the matter itself but would assist the
territory if asked for help. Under the Basic Law, the standing
committee of the National People's Congress _ China's rubber-stamp
parliament _ can ``reinterpret'' Hong Kong's constitution, or the
congress as a whole can vote to amend the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
   Democracy advocates and lawyers say it would be preferable to
amend the Basic Law to limit residency rights rather than overturn
the court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials say it would take too long to amend the
constitution, since the congress as a whole will not meet again
till next March _ too late to block an expected wave of arrivals.
The standing committee of the National People's Congress meets next
month.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of demonstrators on both sides of the issue chanted and
waved banners throughout the day outside the legislature. Polls
indicate most locals fear the arrival of migrants and disagree with
the court ruling.

GORE JUST WAVES OFF THE MEDIA MISGIVINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a fundamental difference between politicians who seem
to come out of nowhere and those whose lineage bred them to the
game from birth.
</P>
<P>
   In the first category would be Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton,
Michael Dukakis, or Pat Buchanan, aspirants who fell into running
for president by a combination of luck and aptitude. The second
group, scions of a successful political parent, would include any
Kennedy you can name, any Bush you can think of, and the topic of
today's screed, Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And the difference is that sons of political families tend to be
wary and guarded around press and public, as opposed to the more
spontaneous, less formal, essentially more free-wheeling gents who
became first of their issue to get elected to anything. What sparks
this thought is the spate of news media nattering about Gore's
presidential campaign, the state of which seems to have displaced
Clinton's libido as bone-of-choice in the media dog's jaws.
</P>
<P>
   I was invited to a brief seance with the vice president Monday,
one of a string of journalists run through his hotel suite like
banquet waiters being inspected by the head chef before a starchy
dinner. A few minutes' chat is not enough time to size up a
politician's psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Not when Gore's campaign spends as much time on the pundits'
couch as it does. The man is raising money to beat the band; he has
only one rival, Bill Bradley, for his nomination, and his
institutional support, including among the often-overlooked foot
soldiers of organized labor, is vast and deep.
</P>
<P>
   But like crows flapping around a barnyard, waiting for something
appetizing to happen, the journalists circle noisily, assuring each
other that this is trouble, things don't look good, this guy is
toast, watch out for Bradley, George W. Bush will eat Gore's lunch,
breakfast, and snack-time delicacy too.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's is the psyche-of-the-moment because he is the recipient
of more free advice and second-guessing than anyone since the
Clinton of impeachment-time. He sheds criticism well _ I'll say
that for Gore. After eight years of either being vice president or
running for it, bidding for eight more years in the top job, God
willing, his skin is thick, his direction clear, and his political
battalions are staffed and financed. So why is he subject of so
much journalistic foreboding?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge disconnect between the real world,'' he
responded evenly, and the slippery, gossipy world of contemporary
journalism. He cited what he called ``content analysis of future
trends when there is no information on which to base it,'' which
sounds to me like 21st century lingo for ``They don't know what
they're talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore waves off all the whispers and misgivings, and in fact the
same doubts are voiced about him as filled the air about Vice
President Bush, trying to succeed Reagan in the '88 campaign. Vice
presidents seem as stick figures, hollow men, when measured against
a charismatic incumbent president like Reagan or Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Why can't Gore do more now to counter the image that he may just
be ``standby equipment,'' in Nelson Rockefeller's cryptic phrase? I
think it's because Gore, like George Bush the elder or Ted Kennedy
in his 1980 run, never needed the media to pump him up, like Reagan
and Clinton did. Clinton courted journalists assiduously and used
them brilliantly till they turned on him, but by that time he
didn't need them anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Bush were sons of US senators; Ted Kennedy,
another pol uneasy around reporters, had two senator brothers.
These three never needed the media in the same way outsiders did,
to define themselves, to carve out elbow room at the table of
national political debate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will not discuss Bradley's challenge, which is smart. Why
build the guy up? Bradley starts out with the 35 percent of
Democrats who cannot abide Clinton or his faithful sidekick. Ted
Kennedy began with roughly that against incumbent Jimmy Carter. But
the reality for insurgents is that while you may start out with 35
percent, you end up with 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore certainly has a Clinton-immorality problem. But Gore does
not have a Gore-immorality problem. With his wife Tipper as partner
on the stump, Gore presents the image of a family man, a steady
customer, with no bimbos in the closet and an appealing family
behind him. In contrast to Hillary Rodham Clinton's icy sang-froid,
Tipper is more of a cheerleader, an America's sweetheart type, an
effective and appealing campaign surrogate.

<P>
   Gore himself is not a charmer in the Reagan-Clinton sense. But
neither are Bill Bradley or George W. Bush. The Texas governor
reminds a lot of pros of Ted Kennedy in '80, a consensus favorite
with a famous name, not too sure of what he's doing or why he's
doing it, who is even warier of the national press pack than
thick-skinned Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is starting to get cuffed around now. After his bandwagon
has been run through the media carwash for a few trips, the shine
will be duller and dents more apparent. Just as Gore is no Clinton
when it comes to schmoozing and oozing, this Bush is no Reagan
either.

A LOT OF NEW AGE HOT AIR ABOUT OXYGEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This would make Chicken Little subscribe to Consumer Reports. In
our latest peril, the sky is not falling. It has disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our atmosphere is severely depleted of oxygen!''
</P>
<P>
   ``As toxic levels on our planet increase and as oxygen levels
decrease, it becomes apparent we must do something!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bodies are now experiencing oxygen starvation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Without adequate supplies of oxygen, in effect, you are merely
rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   You do not have to suffer this dying world. Earth may be the
Titanic, but the new pushers of panic have your life preserver.
They say they have oxygen in tablets. They claim to have oxygen in
drops. You can drop into oxygen bars in California and abroad to
get a direct hit of oxygen from a tank.
</P>
<P>
   You can save your life, if you pay $29.95 for the bottle. This
is a typical price that several nutritional supplement companies
are charging in a racket that gives New Age a bad name. With the
paranoia of characters in a Woody Allen movie, company after
company tries to outdo the other in depicting the putrid state of
our air. Even though scientists say there is still quite sufficient
oxygen to maintain a healthy earth, one Internet ad for a product
called Oxy-Moxy said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Many years ago there was 30 to 35 percent oxygen in the air.
Generally there is now 18 to 20 percent. In certain industrial
cities (e.g. Gary, Ind.) oxygen levels in the air have fallen to 12
to 14 percent _ dangerously close to the minimum that's needed to
sustain human life.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, the claims of how oxygen tablets and drops can
``sustain human life'' have caught the attention of the government.
Early in the spring, the Federal Trade Commission embarrassed two
particularly aggressive companies, Rose Creek Health Products and
the Staff of Life. The companies had advertised ``Vitamin O'' in
big ads in USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC said ``Vitamin O'' was just bottled salt water.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, because of the way our hemoglobin works,
physiologists say you get more oxygen out of one deep breath than
you can ever obtain with a full day of supplements. Furthermore,
the supplements that advertise oxygen in liquid drops are utterly
useless, since the only way you could absorb oxygen out of water is
if you had gills like a fish. ``It's a psych job,'' said Frank
Katch, exercise physiologist at the University of Massachusetts at
Amherst. ``There's no physiological benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   That has not stopped many other companies from trying to psych
out consumers. Between the many companies and their products,
products with names like OxyToddy, OxyBody, Oxy-Gen, Oxy Cooler,
Oxyrich, and Oxygen Solution, the products claim to treat just
about anything imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling ugly? One company's doggerel for a skin moisturizer
claims, ``When superoxygenated minerals are formulated together
with natural pigments, they share their oxygen with these pigments,
turning this nourishing moisturizer into a skin-beautifying
treatment'' that ``protects your face from environmental
pollutants.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeling sick? The oxygen products supposedly treat headaches,
asthma, high blood pressure, cancer, and AIDS. They claim to keep
the blood pure and the colon clean.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling mortal? One company, Life Extensions, posted on its Web
page: ``Oxygen capsules: Researchers find technique to resupply
critical nutrient and halt aging.''
</P>
<P>
   Hot air has long been used to sell air. In 1846, George Green,
in an ad endorsed by five US senators and four congressmen,
proclaimed that ``the celebrated oxygenated bitters'' were ``a sure
remedy for dyspepsia, asthma, and general debility.'' In 1887, a
product called Seven Barks claimed that ``The sixth layer of bark
acted upon the lungs, making the breathing healthy and natural, a
means by which the blood becomes oxydized while passing through the
organs of respiration.''
</P>
<P>
   You would think that by now, just as we are about to celebrate a
millennium when we will praise our progress in medicine and public
health, from sanitation to cutting the mortality rate from cancer,
the Federal Trade Commission would not have to be concerned with
such farcical products.
</P>
<P>
   But just when you thought the FTC was driving Rose Creek
underground, along comes another company with Cat and Dog Oxy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oxy-Pet delivers more oxygen (and oxygen energy) into the
bloodstream from every breath,'' the ad said. ``Important for
animals, who are exposed to so much more pollution than humans are,
since most pollutants are heavier than air and their nostrils are
closer to the ground. Provides added energy and vitality, a better
coat and resistance to aging.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicken Little, holding his Consumer Reports, has to be clucking
at the quacks who claim even Fido can have eternal youth. As for
me, I will continue to take my chances with exhaling and inhaling.
The New Age of oxygen pills and drops returns us to the old age of
selling you nothing for something.

ONEIDAS BET ALL ON SUIT OVER 250,000 ACRES IN N.Y. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERONA, N.Y. _ The turning point in Ray Halbritter's life _ and
possibly the life of central New York State _ came in 1975, when a
fire engulfed the bingo hall on the tiny Indian Reservation where
he lived. The city's fire department refused to answer a call for
help. His uncle and aunt died in the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real awakening experience,'' Halbritter, who was 25
at the time, recalled. ``I realized we had to find a way to take
care of ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   He decided to go to college, then to Harvard Law School. Now, at
age 48, Halbritter is CEO of the Oneida Indian Nation, which owns
not merely a bingo hall but the Turning Stone Casino Resort, a
multimillion-dollar enterprise that has transformed the
once-impoverished tribe into a political and economic powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Halbritter has also mounted the largest Indian land claim in the
United States _ one that could affect similar claims in New York
and all along the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   He is demanding the return of all the land taken from his tribe
over the past 200 years _ a total of 250,000 acres. And he is suing
not just Oneida and Madison Counties but also the 20,000 private
landowners who currently hold title to the territory.
</P>
<P>
   This is no idle challenge: The US Justice Dept. is backing the
land claim, and has publicly declared that one way to settle the
dispute might be to evict the present occupants, who number about
80,000. The Oneida Indians in the area, by contrast, number fewer
than 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The counties, in angry legal counterclaims, have laid siege to
the entire notion of tribal sovereignty -- at least to the degree
it exempts tribal holdings from local laws, regulations and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of tension here, and the tension is growing
dramatically,'' said Ralph Eannes, the Oneida County Executive,
sitting in his 10th floor office, overlooking the vast green
meadows of the Mohawk Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard people talk about guns,'' Eannes went on. ``There's
been a lot of protest rallies against the Indians _ so far
peaceful, but some have threatened not to stay peaceful.''
</P>
<P>
   Every weekend, a few hundred members of a group called the
Upstate Citizens for Equality picket the casino and the Indians'
other enterprises _ five gas stations, a deluxe RV park, an inn,
and a textile printing shop.
</P>
<P>
   One homeowner has hung a poster on his porch, a cartoon of a man
holding a rifle and saying, ``Ray Halbritter, come collect your
rent!''
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Conklin, co-founder of Upstate Citizens, whose family
ties to the area go back three generations, said he does not
condone violence, but does call for a boycott of the Indian
businesses. He tells his fellow townspeople who patronize the
Oneida businesses, ``All you're doing is giving them more money to
sue you with.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oneida tribe filed its lawsuit against the landowners last
December. Since then, Upstate Citizens' membership rolls have
skyrocketed from 600 to 3,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcomed the fact that landowners are named in the suit,''
Conklin said. ``It woke a lot of people up.''
</P>
<P>
   To Halbritter, thoough, the suit should not have shocked
anybody. ``People who live here all knew we have a land claim on
this property,'' he said. ``It says so on the titles and deeds of
their homes. Nobody can claim ignorance. What nobody counted on was
that, one day, we'd assert our claim.''
</P>
<P>
   Halbritter bases the claim on the Treaty of Canandaigua, signed
by the US government in 1794, which promised never to disturb the
Oneida's right to 250,000 acres of central New York.
</P>
<P>
   Of the six Iroquois tribes in the state, the Oneida were alone
in supporting the colonists during the Revolutionary War. They
helped fight off the British in a few key battles and, in a famous
bit of lore, supplied corn to George Washington's hungry troops at
Valley Forge.
</P>
<P>
   The 1794 treaty was the American government's token of
gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   Then, between 1795 and 1846, New York State imposed 26
land-treaties on the Oneida that, eventually, reduced the tribe's
holdings to a mere 32 acres _ barely enough to live on, much less
develop or seriously farm.
</P>
<P>
   The Oneida have long claimed that the state treaties violated
the Trade and Intercourse Act, passed by the US Congress in 1790
and still in force today, which forbids states from buying Indian
lands without the approval of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what's at issue in the current controversy,'' said
Tony Wonderley, the tribe's official historian. ``All the New York
land treaties are illegal because they were done without federal
consent.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, the Oneida sued the State for damages. State judges
rejected their claim. But then in 1985, the US Supreme Court ruled
the Indians' claim had merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That 1985 decision changed the landscape,'' said Robert
Witmer, the lawyer who represents the county. ``Nobody ever had to
take the land claims seriously till then. Once they did, so much
land and money was involved, nobody knew quite how to address it.''
</P>
<P>
   For 14 years, the state government stalled. Then last December
the tribe upped the legal ante. Until then, the Oneida, like many
other Indian tribes pushing land claims, had sought financial
compensation for their loss of land. But since its casino opened in
1993, money hasn't been the prime need of the Oneida.
</P>
<P>
   Respect is. And so, seeking to prod the state into action,
Halbritter modified the suit in December to name the landowners as
defendants and to declare the tribe wanted its land back _ a rare
and brazen step in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say we're being adversarial, but what's what the
American court system is,'' Halbritter said. ``In the courts,
that's what you do in a real-estate claim _ you sue the current
occupants. It's like that anywhere in America. Then, in a
negotiation, you work it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the suit was modified, the state finally appointed
a special negotiator to mediate a compromise, which may be unveiled
later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Eannes, the Oneida County Executive, is bewildered at the
federal governments support for the claim _ support that was
softened somewhat after state political leaders voiced outrage at
the possibility of evictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about this,'' he said. ``Two hundred years ago, New York
State purchased land from Oneida Indians. The federal government
was aware this was going on, and said it shouldn't happen. Still,
the federal government purchased land in Wisconsin that many
Oneidas were moved to. Federal and State governments encouraged
white people to settle in the Mohawk Valley. Now they say, `Oh,
April Fools! It's not really your land!' ''
</P>
<P>
   With the wealth gained from the casino, the Oneida Indian Nation
has already been buying up as much land as it can _ 10,500 acres in
the past three years, spread out in eight of the 10 towns that
cover the 250,000 acres under dispute. And they have declared each
new parcel of land to be part of their sovereign nation.
</P>
<P>
   This expansion has boosted more than just Indian fortunes. The
Oneida are the county's largest employer, providing jobs to 3,000
people, 90 percent of them non-Indian. The economic boost has also
compelled Moody's and Standard &AMP; Poor's to upgrade the county's
municipal bond rating, saving taxpayers $3.2 million in borrowing
costs.
</P>
<P>
   However, their new wealth has also triggered resentments,
especially since Indian nations pay no state or local taxes and are
not obliged to observe state or local laws.
</P>
<P>
   Eannes acknowledges what many of the Indians' critics do not _
that, in lieu of property taxes, the Oneidas have paid over $1
million in a so-called ``silver covenant,'' which goes to the local
school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he has other concerns. ``If they buy back 250,000 acres,
they rip the community of central New York apart,'' Eannes said.
``If this guy pays taxes but that guy doesn't -- this guy lives by
zoning laws, that guy doesn't _ what does that do to a sense of
community?''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever side one takes, it is clear the Oneida Indians are
carving out a separatist infrastructure. They have their own police
force, their own environmental protection agency, food inspectors
(for the casino's six restaurants), housing authority, free health
clinics, and children's and elderly centers.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the county is mounting a legal challenge to the
very concept of Indian sovereignty, arguing that while the original
Reservation should remain tax-exempt, additional acquisitions of
land should not.
</P>
<P>
   In the Oneidas' case, that would keep tax-free the 32 acres they
were left with in the mid-1800s _ but not the 10,000 acres they
have recently acquired, which includes the land for the casino and
their other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Halbritter sees all this as a continuation of age-old struggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fire has always been on my mind, in everything I do,'' he
said, thinking back on the blaze and official indifference that
killed his uncle and aunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would just rather that we go away,'' he added. ``When we
had nothing, when we were living on our 32 acres and had our hands
out for everything, they didn't worry about how we fit into the
community. Now we've empowered ourselves _ that's what worries
them.''

PAPA AND PRIVACY; FUN WITH `PHANTOM' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a cartoon on the contributor's page of this week's New
Yorker, Robert Mankoff drops a real photo of J. D. Salinger into a
sketch of a TV news show. The caption reads: ``And, in literary
news, J. D. Salinger's privacy has been violated once again by his
appearance in this cartoon.'' It's funny to rib Salinger about his
famous reclusiveness, particularly in the magazine that was once
his home, and it's even funnier to upend the media that manufacture
their own ``news.'' Just about everyone looks silly in the
cartoon's perspective, including the viewer with his nose sticking
into the inane TV report.
</P>
<P>
   But violation of privacy is more than just a joke in this issue
of The New Yorker, for it contains an excerpt from Ernest
Hemingway's forthcoming ``unpublished novel,'' or ``fictionalized
memoir,'' which has been given the title ``True at First Light.''
The book has been edited by Hemingway's son Patrick, who cut the
850-page manuscript in half, but it's hard to forget that his
father did not intend to release it for publication. See how you
feel reading the piece, which will find its way into the author's
oeuvre despite his wishes. There are a few moments of descriptive
grace, but it is clearly unfinished and lacking in Hemingway
polish. Set in East Africa, the excerpt revolves around the
shooting of a troublesome lion and a pair of eagles, as well as the
shooting of the horse that became the bait for the lion and the
eagles. Somehow all that predatory activity seems fitting.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of predators . . . Sometimes it looks as though the
more that's written around a piece of entertainment _ interviews
with stars, articles on budget and special effects _ the less we
can expect from the entertainment itself. I'm talking ``Phantom
Menace,'' of course, the prequel that appears to be classier than
your everyday average money-grubbing sequel only because of its
``Star Wars'' ancestry, an ancestry whose reputation has become
inflated now that sci-fi event movies are a way of life. Unable to
leave the ``Star Wars'' series alone, particularly after its
lucrative return as a ``Special Edition,'' George Lucas has opted
to forget about restraint and unleash on us not only prequels 4, 5,
and 6 but a seemingly unending torrent of promotional blather.
</P>
<P>
   Of the bazillion ``Phantom Menace'' pieces on newsstands these
days, the only one I could read was in Movieline, thinking it was
probably the one movie magazine able to resist all the glee.
Indeed, the June issue has a Joe Queenan piece in which the always
sour writer puts on a Yoda mask and makes his way around New York
speaking lines like ``Have will I your largest caffe latte, yes,
um.'' Guess what? No one seems to care much about Yoda, although
Queenan does manage to put his annoying Yoda persona to practical
use with telephone marketers.
</P>
<P>
   Movieline also features a list of ``100 Questions We Honestly
Want to Ask Hollywood,'' beginning with ``Where is Roberto
Benigni's `off' button?'' Other pressing questions include ``Do
Joseph Fiennes and Ralph Fiennes really share any DNA?'' and ``How
did God let Keanu Reeves get born 75 years too late for the great
Silent Movie Era?'' But the timeliest question is a good one: ``If
`Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace' doesn't make more money
than any film in history in the first 10 days, is it a failure?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Robert Love, the managing editor of Rolling Stone, comes up with
the word for the tone of today's entertainment world: It's
``adolescentric.'' After all, teenagers will spend some $141
billion this year, and everybody wants a piece of that. Back in the
early 1990s, it took boomercentric advertisers a while to catch on
to the Generation X factor; but absolutely no one is missing out on
the new kids _ ``Echo Boomers, the Baby Boomlet, the Millennial
Generation, Generation Wired, Generation Y,'' whatever. Like it or
not, we're marching to a teen beat.
</P>
<P>
   Buried in the issue's ``Teen Hot List'' is a little piece called
``The Sell,'' which helps define what the magazine's cover heralds
as ``The New Teen Spirit.'' Unlike Generation X, today's teenagers
don't object to being marketed to _ as long as it's good marketing:
``And we all know what bad marketing looks like. It's either stiff
and lame or else too self-consciously hip. It features slang that
is so fifteen minutes ago. It talks down to teenagers. It fails to
recognize that a fifteen-year-old only wants to act and buy like a
seventeen-year-old.''

A WONDROUS DESIGN, BUT A FLAT RENDERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE SPELL 
By Alan Hollinghurst 
Viking, 257 pp., $24.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alan Hollinghurst's third novel, ``The Spell,'' has the formal
elegance of an 18th-century garden, but the story it tells is about
romps in the bushes. Nature always will burst through patterns of
order to claim its own. The amusing fascination of the novel lies
in the discrepancies between human nature and artistic design.
</P>
<P>
   Hollinghurst puts two couples through an intricate pavane. Robin
Woodfield, an architect, is trying to rebuild his life with a young
would-be actor named Justin after the loss of his lover to AIDS.
Justin invites his own ex-lover Alex down to the country cottage
for the weekend; during the stay, Alex meets Robin's young gay son,
Danny, and ultimately takes up with him (``Dan,'' his father says,
``you can't be serious!''). Drifting through the story is a teenage
handyman named Terry, the cheerfully slutty town hustler, who winds
up in just about everybody's bed as Hollinghurst explores the
nuances of the complicated relationships among his characters _
takers and givers, father and son, son and lovers, lover and
ex-lover _ and the strains of coupledom, which one pair survives
and another doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   A nifty little prelude and a postlude frame the story. In the
prelude we meet Robin during his student days, 20 years before the
principal events of the story. He's making a pilgrimage through the
Arizona desert to the ruins of a house designed by Frank Lloyd
Wright. Afterward, he stumbles into a bar, where he is about to
score with a cowboy when he makes a prearranged phone call to
London and learns he's going to become a father _ the first of the
book's many paradoxes and surprises. The postlude reunites most of
the principal characters, after a decent interval full of change
and stability, and they repeat an excursion to the brink of the
Dorset cliffs over the ocean _ but now there is a different sort of
brinksmanship, not the self-dramatizing kind but the kind that runs
through entire lives, as some of these characters have finally
realized.
</P>
<P>
   Hollinghurst builds his novel on contrasts, between youth and
age; between friendship and love, sex and romance; between city and
country, chamber music and club music; between natural states and
minds altered by drugs and alcohol. These contrasts generate gentle
humor, particularly when Hollinghurst deploys them in unexpected
ways and among unconventional people. He's also a witty, if not an
ostentatious, stylist, who describes Alex in a sex shop as standing
``amid the alien porn.'' The writer doesn't play favorites, and no
one has all the good lines _ and no one gets off easy.
</P>
<P>
   Readers of Hollinghurst's earlier novels, ``The Swimming-Pool
Library'' and ``The Folding Star,'' may, however, regret a certain
lack of density in this book _ deftly designed as it is, and full
of such entertaining set pieces as a scandalous but curiously
old-fashioned country-house party that brings all the characters
and conflicts together, like the second-act curtain of a play by W.
Somerset Maugham (``The Circle,'' say). Hollinghurst, like Proust,
is a novelist who happens to be gay rather than a gay novelist who
is in the business of writing gay novels. But this book does become
exasperatingly narrow in focus. ``Don't these people ever think
about anything other than their own emotional and sexual
gratification?'' we begin to wonder _ as we don't in pure farce or
romantic comedy. Hollinghurst's problem is that he has conferred
dimensions of depth on his characters that he doesn't plumb.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he enjoys some fun at the expense of Danny,
exemplar of the feckless young. ``Danny brought his big notebook
with him as usual, and his more secret plan was to try to write a
play about some of the people he knew on the club scene. . . . He
didn't envisage any technical obstacles to writing something
stageable and sensationally topical; he spent one morning planning
the guest list for the first-night party, and going over certain
points in the interviews he would give.'' But he also understands
Danny, or Alex comes to understand him. ``Danny would be a great
lover, that would be his career, though he knew next to nothing
about love, just as some great musicians knew nothing about music,
beyond their gift for making it.''
</P>
<P>
   While the other characters, unlike Danny, have jobs,
responsibilities, outside interests, and even ideas, we hear too
little about them as they move through their paces and places in
Hollinghurst's pattern. Something about Hollinghurst's other books
was unpredictable, but despite its cast of characters and louche
locales, ``The Spell'' remains curiously domesticated. It's a
romance, one may say in the book's defense. But Shakespeare knew
that romances were wild, and Hollinghurst doesn't.

EXCUSES FOR ALL `STAR WARS' NEEDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today (May 19) is one of the most important days in postwar
American cultural history. A day as important, perhaps, as July 19,
1957, which must be around the time that Norman Mailer realized
that he _ and a generation of writers to follow _ could make more
money and achieve greater fame writing about themselves than
writing about the world around them. A day ranking in significance
with Feb. 15, 1987. That was when ABC television started
broadcasting its epochal, eerily prescient, seven-part series
``Amerika,'' about the Soviet takeover of America.
</P>
<P>
   Going to work or attending school is out of the question.
Workplace absenteeism alone is expected to run into the millions.
Massachusetts education officials stupidly scheduled their
notorious MCAS exams for this week. We can reasonably expect
several thousand ``incompletes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Commonwealth's own Brett Dewey gets it right on his
``Wookiee hooky'' Web site,
www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Studio/9203/: ``Skip Work, See Star
Wars!'' But to take the day off, you will need an excuse. Feel free
to borrow one of mine from this special Clip 'n' Save feature; I'm
into sharing.
</P>
<P>
   For schoolchildren: I took the day off to do astronomy research
for the MCAS.
</P>
<P>
   For gifted schoolchildren: We're reading Joseph Campbell's ``The
Hero With a Thousand Faces'' in English class, and I wanted to see
how the Jedi knights fit into Campbell's mythic schema.
</P>
<P>
   For Web-addicted schoolchildren: Harry (Knowles, Internet film
guru) told me to see it.
</P>
<P>
   For the sophisticated, albeit not totally credible, schoolchild:
I was attending Laurel Ulrich's lecture, ``Sheep in the Parlor,
Wheels on the Common: Needlework and Politics in 18th-century
Boston,'' at the Museum of Fine Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Public-sector employees: I'm owed a vacation day, I'm sure.
</P>
<P>
   Private-sector employees: I was working at home, I'm sure.
</P>
<P>
   Anglo-phonies' excuse: I was attending a memorial service
commemorating the 463d anniversary of the beheading of Anne Boleyn
(May 19, 1536).
</P>
<P>
   Anglo-phonies' excuse, Part Deux: I was attending a memorial
service commemorating the 64th anniversary of T. E. Lawrence's
death on May 19, 1935.
</P>
<P>
   Enough fiddle-faddle. The ``Star Wars'' situation is somewhat
complex. Because the movie falls far short of expectations _ yes, I
have seen it, at what my wife called a ``second-tier press
preview'' _ many citizens will need an excuse not to see the
capstone artistic creation of the American Century. Herewith, those
excuses:
</P>
<P>
   For PETA members: I can't bear to see Jabba the Hutt bite the
heads off those poor little lizards.
</P>
<P>
   For the overly sensitive: Jar Jar Binks's exaggerated Pimp Walk
is offensive to homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   For bibliophiles: I read the book (published May 3).
</P>
<P>
   For ``power'' computer users: I don't need to see the movie;
I'll download the 6 trillion-byte bootleg video from
copyrightinfringement.com.
</P>
<P>
   Theatergoers with a social conscience: I think it would be
better to use those 2,500 theaters to shelter Kosovar refugees.
</P>
<P>
   For scholarship students: I'm saving my grocery-bagging money to
see ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' 14 times.
</P>
<P>
   For cineastes: I couldn't miss ``Loony Tom the Happy Lover'' at
the Harvard Film Archive, a brilliant articulation of underground
filmmaker James Broughton's ``polymorphous, bisexual universe.''

 BOSTON: ... Boston stadium.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On March 15, another key development occurred, not in New
England, but in Phoenix, where NFL owners voted to change league
policy to foster internal funding of stadium projects. Finneran
felt vindicated. And the door to bringing the Patriots back home
opened a little wider.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really a key turning point,'' Finneran said
recently.``It meant the league might be willing to participate. And
it was a tacit acceptance of what the House had argued all along:
that those who stood to benefit from a new stadium, like the NFL
owners, also had to participate in funding it.''
</P>
<P>
   A month later, the Boston group -- now consisting of Kirk,
Monan, Boston Edison chairman Thomas J. May, Budd, and Connell --
began crafting an opinion piece to be published in the Globe. The
draft, articulating broad backing for keeping the team, was
circulated on Beacon Hill in advance so leaders would not be
stunned when they opened their papers April 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest is history,'' Kirk said. ``This thing just
unfolded.''
</P>
<P>
   The article triggered strong statements of support, most
importantly from Beacon Hill, and unexpectedly positive statements
from the mayor saying he was open-minded. Privately, though, it
soon became clear Menino still did not want a stadium in Boston, so
the group began focusing on Foxborough, the Patriots' base since
1971.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Birmingham, the Senate president and a former labor
negotiator, called Kirk at home, urging a face-to-face summit on
Beacon Hill the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way I figured we might be able to get this done was
to all sit down in the same room and hammer it out,'' Birmingham
said. ``So that's what we proposed.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It all came together, quite literally in the 11th hour _ on
Tuesday, April 27, at 11:35 p.m., to be exact.
</P>
<P>
   The state's power troika emerged from a three-hour meeting with
a plan that could upend everything the team planned and Hartford's
dream of becoming an NFL city.
</P>
<P>
   The seed planted by Kirk and Rooney nearly five months earlier
had sprouted in this cluster of leadership gathered in Birmingham's
cavernous office, paneled with Honduran Mahogany and draped in
patinated yellow and green fabric.
</P>
<P>
   At one end of the 12-foot antique table sat the House speaker,
Finneran. Birmingham sat at the other. Seated on blue-leather
chairs between them were Kirk, Governor Cellucci, Lieutenant
Governor Jane Swift, aides to all three political leaders,
stadium-expert Goodell, and another NFL executive, Neil Glat.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second night in a row the group had met in
Birmingham's office. The first evening, there was a lot of
posturing. By the second night, it was clear everyone was working
toward a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Except there was a sticking point: Finneran's demand that the
Patriots pay up to $2 million a year to cover some of the state's
costs for road, sewer, and other public infrastructure work
required at a new Foxboro Stadium. NFL officials balked, noting
that should be the state's responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   A tense standoff ensued, and for a few minutes it looked like
the deal could die.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by the impasse, Cellucci, a strong supporter of a new
stadium for the Patriots, sided with Finneran. Still, NFL officials
insisted they couldn't agree to the payback language. To keep the
momentum of the talks going, Birmingham asked Kirk and the NFL men
to wait in another room while the three political leaders discussed
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   After about 30 minutes, they were invited back in, presented
with the the final plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a general feeling that this was it,'' Birmingham
said later. ``The deal was as good as it was going to get.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL signed on.
</P>
<P>
   Under the offer, drafted into the legislation that passed
Tuesday, Kraft would build the stadium, partially assisted by
low-rate NFL financing. The state would provide $70 million in
infrastructure improvements around Route 1. Further, Kraft would
grant an easement on his land, allowing the state to upgrade access
ramps and sewer lines on his private property.
</P>
<P>
   Several people involved in the negotiations claim credit for the
easement plan. But whoever promoted the idea, it broke the
stalemate by eliminating the land purchase component of the
Senate's last plan, which Finneran opposed, while preserving
infrastructure spending that the team deemed necessary.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Massachusetts moved closer to a counteroffer, Connecticut
fell behind.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, on Thursday, April 29, a team of Patriots
consultants delivered a prognosis that put the Hartford deal in
critical condition: the stadium, they concluded, most likely could
not be ready by 2002, as promised, because it would take longer to
clear the site of the steam plant and scrub it of environmental
contamination. Under the stadium contract, that was enough for the
team to walk away without penalty, as long as it made the decision
by the upcoming Sunday, May 2.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft faced a choice: wait at least another year for the
Hartford stadium or take his chances in Massachusetts, where a plan
was now on the table but had not received full legislative
approval.
</P>
<P>
   That night, Kraft, his son Jonathan, and team executive Andy
Wasynczuk flew to Hartford to see if a third option was possible:
Would Connecticut extended the penalty-free deadline another month,
by which time a more definitive review of the site could be
completed?
</P>
<P>
   Rowland refused. Mostly, the governor couldn't believe the team
would really turn their backs on a free stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a game of high stakes poker'' said one person who was
in the room.``And I think the governor was calling the team's
bluff.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, furious and desperate, gave Kraft just 24 hours to
decide _ even though Kraft legally had several days to make up his
mind. The meeting ended. They all left the governor's office to
face a throng of reporters camped outside and issued sober, but
vague, statements about being committed to their ``goal'' of the
Patriots playing in Hartford by 2002. They shook hands as cameras
clicked and went their separate ways.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a final parting.
</P>
<P>
   Consultants for both sides stayed up well into Friday morning,
trying to salvage the agreement, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, the Krafts got a final consultants' report.
</P>
<P>
   With a void of good news, Robert Kraft retreated to his office
on the 34th floor of a Boston skyscraper to fax the formal
termination notice to Connecticut. He called Rowland as it was
being transmitted.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Kraft and Wasynczuk left the room. It was a painful and
emotional conversation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, in Los Angeles promoting Massachusetts film
production, was chatting with renowned chef Wolfgang Puck, about to
make a cheese, tomato, and pepper pizza, when news of the stunning
about-face broke.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, Cellucci would be on the set of ``The Tonight
Show.'' Jay Leno, originally from the Boston area, gave a nod to
the governor during his opening monologue, asking him what was
happening with the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   The camera, beaming the program to some 6 million viewers, spun
around toward the audience where Cellucci sat smiling with his
thumb in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're staying,'' the governor shouted, ``in Massachusetts!''

 By JAMES BANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Alfred V. Kidder offered 50 cents to the man who found
the first skeleton.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1916 and Kidder, a pipe-smoking archeologist fresh out of
Harvard University's graduate school, stood atop a rocky knoll
overlooking New Mexico's Pecos Valley. On this tongue of land,
Kidder's team had begun unearthing the ruins of an American Indian
pueblo.
</P>
<P>
   The Pecos dig, later hailed by scholars as the coming of age of
American archeology, would propel Kidder into prominence in his
field. It would create one of the most important collections of
human remains in the United States, leading to groundbreaking
research in the study of osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   But it would also cause wrenching pain to the descendants of the
Pecos Indians whose remains were exhumed. Today, with the return of
the remains to New Mexico imminent, they regard the excavation as a
desecration, and they wonder how anyone could have so thoughtlessly
violated such holy ground.
</P>
<P>
   But on that early summer day as his team picked through the red
soil, Kidder had his mind on more temporal matters. He was thinking
about bones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very anxious, of course, to find skeletons, because they
would lead to pottery,'' Kidder wrote in his memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We began to find skeletons pretty soon.''
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of digging, a single skeleton was uncovered.
Kidder reduced the reward to 25 cents. The more they dug, the more
skeletons they discovered and the finder's fee was lowered to a
dime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally said if they found any more skeletons, I would fine
them,'' Kidder recalled years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``That rubbish heap was literally full of skeletons.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``rubbish heap'' _ actually a resting place where the Pecos
buried their dead alongside ordinary objects _ and the hundreds of
rooms next to it, ultimately yielded more than 2,000 human remains.
Most of them were taken to Harvard's Peabody Museum of Archeology
and Ethnology. In addition to the remains, the Kidder excavation
took thousands of artifacts, including ceramic vessels, shell
pendants, and effigies. The objects and remains, which date from
the 12th century to the 1830s, have been kept at Phillips Academy
of Andover's Robert Peabody Museum of Archeology, which sponsored
Kidder's excavation.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday., 84 years after Kidder began his work in Pecos, the
remains and remaining artifacts finally started their journey home
after a ceremony at the Harvard museum. On Saturday there will be a
private reburial ceremony in Pecos, New Mexico, N.M., marking the
largest repatriation of Native American Indian remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a phenomenal event,'' said William Whatley, tribal
preservation officer for the Pueblo of Jemez, a tribe that traces
its lineage to the Pecos Pueblo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a closing of the circle.''
</P>
<P>
   The reburial ends years of negotiations between tribal officials
and the two museums _ a process that began four years after the
passage of the federal Native American Graves Protection and
Repatriation Act in 1990. The law requires museums to inventory
their collections of items that might have sacred or special tribal
significance and to return them to those tribes that can make
strong claims.
</P>
<P>
   Jemez tribal representatives paid their first visit to Harvard's
Peabody Museum in 1996. They were led to a sprawling, two-storied
storage room filled with thousands of boxes of human remains. The
Pecos remains occupied nearly the entire second level of the room _
and the sight of them caused the tribal leaders to weep. The tribal
leaders then consulted the spirits of the ancestors, Whatley said.
The answer, he said, was unequivocal: `We want to go home.' ''
</P>
<P>
   With over 11,000 sets of human remains from the United States in
its possession, Harvard's Peabody Museum has a collection that is
one of the largest in the Western hemisphere, second only to that
of the Smithsonian Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Anthropologists and medical researchers have regarded the Pecos
collection as a scientific treasure. The bones, by and large, are
in remarkably good condition, and the collection, which is
demographically representative of a single population, is large
enough to be statistically significant. The bones have been studied
by dozens of researchers, from eugenicists in the 1930s who equated
cranial size with intelligence, to scientists who have engaged in
more legitimate inquiries _ everything from head injuries to tooth
decay.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant research was arguably performed by Johns
Hopkins anthropologist Christopher Ruff. His studies demonstrated
that exercise could strengthen aging bones by enlarging them to
compensate for the shrinking mass associated with osteoporosis
</P>
<P>
   Ruff called the repatriation of the bones a ``significant loss
to science,'' but he said he also understood the fiercely emotional
sentiments of the Jemez people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see both sides of the issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, it's unfortunate in cases like this that the people
involved don't fully appreciate the scientific importance of the
collection.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jemez, who say their ancestors migrated from Pecos Pueblo in
1838, said they were glad that some good came come from the bones'
presence at Harvard. But they said no amount of scientific research
would compensate for Kidder's desecration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our belief that no one has the right to disturb the
graves of another man's ancestors,'' Whatley said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Whatley said the tribe bore no animosity toward Kidder,
Harvard or Andover. He said Harvard's Peabody Museum curators had
handled the remains with the care of parents. Representatives from
both the Harvard and Andover museums, he said, would be invited to
Pecos for the May 22 ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though it's a private family funeral, those
representatives will be standing side by side with us,'' Whatley
said. ``They're considered family.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Kidder, he died of heart failure in 1963 after an
illustrious career. His body was buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   But his story didn't end there.
</P>
<P>
   Before she died, Kidder's wife, Madeleine, requested that upon
her death, her husband's remains be exhumed from his grave in
Cambridge, cremated and reburied in New Mexico, next to hers.
Today, a simple, flat stone by a stream bed marks the grave, which
is just a half mile or so from the site of Kidder's famous dig.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a place he deeply loved,'' said Kidder's only surviving
son, James. ``He was repatriated too.''

`STAR WARS' A TOP BRAND, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Inforonics wants a few good ``Star Wars'' fans. Looking to
recruit new workers, the tiny provider of ``e-business solutions''
will run help-wanted ads at some local theaters showing ``The
Phantom Menace,'' the new ``Star Wars'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   ```Star Wars' fans are our work force,'' says Inforonics vice
president Mark Pinsley, explaining the hiring strategy of the
Littleton, Mass. company.
</P>
<P>
   Set to debut May 19, ``The Phantom Menace'' is more than a
movie; it's a brand, a marketer's delight, a job recruiting device,
a Super Bowl of the cinema. Because it appeals to a host of
demographic groups, the movie is virtually certain to stir up a
merchandising frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies looking to exploit the hype that surrounds
the premiere of of the fourth ``Star Wars'' movie from George Lucas
are Hasbro, Taco Bell, Pepsi-Cola, and Lego.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue here is not to create hype; it's to control it,''
says Marty Brochstein, executive editor of the Licensing Letter, a
newsletter that tracks entertainment licensing deals.
</P>
<P>
   Many successful movies these days reach only a narrow segment of
the population. In 1997, it was teen-age girls who were largely
responsible for turning ``Titanic'' into a blockbuster. Two years
earlier, their younger sisters were wowed by ``Pocahontas,'' the
animated Disney film. But ``Lion King'' was a far bigger hit
because it impressed both girls and boys.
</P>
<P>
   `Star Wars'' is different. If Sir Thomas More was ``A Man for
All Seasons,'' then ``The Phantom Menace'' is a movie for nearly
all demographics.
</P>
<P>
   When toys inspired by the new movie went on sale earlier this
month, stores threw open their doors at midnight, not exactly
prime-time for the children.
</P>
<P>
   At the FAO Schwarz in Boston's Back Bay, it's been mostly adult
toy collectors who've been thronging the premises. Kids aren't
expected to start clamoring for the stuff until the movie debuts
and companies begin running ads for movie-related merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   To drive early sales, FAO Schwarz telemarketers called the
ever-growing number of adult toy collectors in its customer data
base. So far, light sabers and action figures of Darth Maul, the
movie's villain, have been the big hits with this crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's interested in the bad guy,'' says FAO Schwarz
spokeswoman Jennifer Picard. ``Darth Vader had such an effect on
people, and this guy is supposed to be worse.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the univeral appeal that sets ``Star Wars'' apart from
other toy fads, notes Toy Book publisher Jim Silver.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers from a few years ago?
Nearly 90 percent of Power Rangers toys were bought for a child
under the age of 8, he says. Not so with ``Star Wars.'' Adult
collectors account for about 75 percent of the early sales for
``Phantom Menace'' merchandise, he says. And the scramble that
these collectors touch off only adds to the movie's hype.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, ``The Phantom Menace'' will sell about $1
billion worth of toys this year. That's good news for Hasbro Inc.
of Pawtucket, R.I., which owns the licensing rights to the first
three ``Star Wars'' movies and which paid a hefty licensing fee for
the rights to make toys related to ``The Phantom Menace'' and the
two other movies that Lucas plans to make as part of his second
trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   Over the life of the new deal, Hasbro is expected to pay $600
million in royalties to companies controlled by Lucas. At first,
plans called for Hasbro to share most of the toy market with
another company, Galoob Toys Inc. But partly to gain a bigger share
of the ``Star Wars'' toy market, Hasbro simply went out and bought
Galoob last year for $220 million.
</P>
<P>
   For Hasbro, the challenge is to sustain the ``Star Wars''
momentum for another decade; a short-term blowout around the
release of ``The Phantom Menace'' simply won't make the nut for the
world's second largest toymaker. To break even, Brochstein of the
Licensing Letter estimates Hasbro will have to sell $3 billion
worth of product over the life of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   One way to maximize future sales is for Hasbro to make exclusive
toy lines for various retailers. A few years ago, K-B Toys had
great success with an exclusive Han Solo storm-trooper line, says
K-B spokesman John Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro spokesman Wayne Charness says no exclusive lines are
planned this year. But don't be surprised to see them come out in
2000 and 2001, the interval between ``The Phantom Menace'' and the
scheduled release of the next movie in the trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to inspiration for toys, ``The Phantom Menace''
has ``incredible richness,'' says Charness, who notes that Hasbro
will introduce 200 new toys this year tied to the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way we could bring out all the fresh new product
from this movie in just a year,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Not all toys will be from Hasbro. Such is the beguiling nature
of the force that Lego Inc. has decided to enter into the first
licensing deal in its history.
</P>
<P>
   In the two decades since the release of the first ``Star Wars''
movie, toy companies have changed dramatically, and ``Star Wars''
may be one of the reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Once toy companies actually made toys. Now to a large degree,
they are marketing companies that manage merchandise licenses and
look to movies and TV for a boost. Today's toy companies are
``hitchhiking on Hollywood,'' says Babson College marketing
professor Kathleen Seiders.
</P>
<P>
   Given the synergies between the two industries, Boston
University professor Sue Parenio adds, ``You have to wonder which
came first _ the movie script or the marketing plan?''
</P>
<P>
   If Hasbro hopes to sell a ton of toys, PepsiCo Inc. looks to
move an ocean of soft drinks. Pepsi plans to distribute 5 billion
soda cans bearing the likenesses of characters from the new movie,
among them a ``special edition'' of Yoda cans.
</P>
<P>
   At e-Bay, the Internet auction house, reports already circulate
that a Yoda can will fetch $150, says Pepsi spokesman Jon Harris.
Pepsi isn't just putting pictures on soda cans; it's also enlisted
a Lucas company to create a special ``spokes-alien'' that will star
in its ``Phantom Menace'' commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Three restaurant chains once owned by Pepsi, KFC, Pizza Hut, and
Taco Bell, are also running promotions tied to the movie. Three
planets are featured in ``The Phantom Menace,'' and each restaurant
will be tricked out as one of planets.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time ever, the three chains will appear together
in a TV ad campaign, says Amy Sherwood, a spokeswoman for Tricon
Global Restaurants Inc., the parent of the three chains. On a TV
near you, expect to see Colonel Sanders and the Taco Bell chihuahua
frolicking to a ``Star Wars'' theme.
</P>
<P>
   According to Newsweek magazine, ``The Phantom Menace''
respresents a $2.5 billion marketing investment for Pepsi and
Tricon, but the two companies separately dispute that number.
</P>
<P>
   Could ``The Phantom Menace'' actually flop? After all, Hollywood
thought ``Godzilla'' would be a blockbuster, and Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. heavily promoted ``Prince of Egypt.'' Despite proven story
lines and big corporate tie-ins, neither movie lived up to advance
billings.
</P>
<P>
   According to editorial director Jill Bilzi of Playthings
magazine, the Internet helped croak ``Godzilla.'' When word quickly
spread among kids that the movie wasn't very good, ``Godzilla''
bombed at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, some observers have laid the blame for a would-be
blockbuster's failure to a marketing plan that simply overwhelmed
the movie's script.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Toy Story'' made a hash out of that theory. It created
roles for nearly every old toy in the play room _ Etch-a-Sketch,
Slinky, Mr. Potato Head. And still the movie was a surprise smash.
To this day, Mattel may regret that it nixed a star turn for Barbie
that was written into an early draft of the script.
</P>
<P>
   One of Lucas's key skills may be his knack for perfectly
balancing a movie script with a merchandising plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never a sense that the merchandising tail is wagging
the movie dog,'' licensing expert Brochstein says of Lucas. ``He's
a business man and he's a story teller.''
</P>
<P>
   A well-told story is no guarantee that a movie will also be a
merchandising hit, however. Consider the fate of the recently
animated version of ``The Hunchback of Notre Dame.'' Even Disney
couldn't make Quasimodo lovable enough for a mass audience.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike other movies, ``Star Wars'' has a 22-year track
record of merchandising success behind it. That means ``The Phantom
Menace'' is ``as close to a sure thing as you can have'' in
Hollywood, Brochstein says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt it will be big,'' he says of the new movie
and the companies that look to cash in on it. ``The question is:
`Will it be big enough?' ''

WOMEN GET DAY IN COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Financial consultant Anne Kaspar had no idea that the lawsuit
she and seven other women filed against Merrill Lynch several years
go would help launch a nationwide backlash affecting the way bias
complaints now are resolved on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought there might be a few institutional changes, but we
never expected the lawsuit to have such an enormous impact,'' said
Kaspar.
</P>
<P>
   For years, stockbrokers, salespeople, and securities traders
have been required to take any dispute they had with their employer
to a hearing before industry arbitrators, rather than a jury of
their peers.
</P>
<P>
   But now, eight years after the US Supreme Court approved the use
of mandatory arbitration to settle employment discrimination
claims, some key players in the securities industry have backed
away from mandatory arbitration, while other firms are searching
for alternative ways to handle discrimination disputes.
</P>
<P>
   So far, The National Association of Securities Dealers has
dropped a mandatory arbitration clause from its U-4 form, the
application employees in the industry must use to register with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. And, starting this year, the
Boston Stock Exchange and the Chicago Stock Exchange exclude
certain discrimination claims from mandatory arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Stock Exchange announced this year that it would no
longer arbitrate employee discrimination disputes.But that's not
all.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Merrill Lynch ended its use of mandatory arbitration
to handle bias complaints, becoming the first company on Wall
Street to do so. The firm made its decision as part of a settlement
of the lawsuit filed by Kaspar. That complaint has since grown to
include some 900 women who came forward under a process established
by the settlement last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We changed our policy July 1 of last year,'' commented Bill
Holden, a spokesman for Merrill Lynch in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Jay W. Waks, who represents employers and chairs the
Employment Law Practice at Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays &AMP; Handler
LLP in New York City, believes the shift away from arbitration by
the exchanges could pose serious problems for employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge jump, a huge shift, for both the New York Stock
Exchange and the National Association of Securities Dealers,'' he
said. ``To carve out an exception for employment discrimination
cases leaves a big problem for both employers and employees,'' he
said. ``Many employment discrimination claims are coupled with
traditional common law claims such as refusal to pay bonus or
intentional infliction of emotional distress or defamation. That
means some issues could end up going through arbitration and other
issues would be heard in court, creating more litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   For many employers mandatory arbitration has been a boon. Not
only does it limit lengthy and expensive court battles, but it also
reduces publicity that can seriously damage a company's reputation
and its business.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since the nation's highest court ruled in favor of
mandatory arbitration, thousands of companies have sought to have
sexual harassment and age, gender, and other discrimination claims
moved from the courts to private hearings for binding arbitration.
More than half a million Wall Street workers are still legally
bound by agreements mandating that they arbitrate disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Smith Barney found itself the subject of a suit in May 1996. The
92-page complaint alleged that at least one of the firm's offices
had created a ``boom-boom room'' where women were belittled by men.
The suit also said although established male brokers earned as much
as $200,000 per year, successful women brokers typically earned no
more than $100,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   After press reports about the Smith Barney and Merrill Lynch
lawsuits caught the public's eye, things began to change. The
National Organization for Women launched a national campaign in
which Smith Barney was targeted as a ``merchant of shame,'' major
television and news outlets interviewed women plaintiffs from both
lawsuits, and a handful of courts began outlawing the practice.
</P>
<P>
   Kaspar, the Lincoln, Mass. woman who joined Merrill Lynch in
August 1991, said both she and the firm had agreed that she would
be ``a million dollar producer within a certain amount of time and
that I would receive management support.''
</P>
<P>
   She claims she grew concerned when the firm gave her a
performance goal that was considerably higher than that of a male
colleague who had been hired around the same time. According to
Kaspar, she was expected to have more than $20 million under
management the first year and $250,000 in commissions. He was
expected to manage a $10 million portfolio and make $90,000 in
commissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a situation where you were penalized if you did not
meet these goals and objectives,'' said Kaspar. ``Being penalized
means management will not pay for seminars you need to attend, and
they will dock your pay by 25 percent. Once that happens, you
cannot recover without devine intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaspar complained. ``I went in and said, ``I can't take this
anymore,' '' she recalled. ``My manager turned his back to me and
said, `I can let you die here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Holden, speaking on behalf of the company, said Kaspar was
treated fairly. Clearly, Kaspar, now an independent financial
adviser, disagreed. In October 1995, she sued.

A LONG TIME COMING FOR ALPHA INDUSTRIES' STOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The good news about Alpha Industries Inc. is that the Woburn
company's stock has broken into new high territory in the last two
months.
</P>
<P>
   The amazing news: The old Alpha stock high was recorded 19 years
ago, long before combustible company cofounder George Kariotis
would stage his ill-fated gubernatorial campaign against Michael
Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   Like a cryogenically sealed space traveler, Alpha stock has
continued to sail on for years at near-comatose levels. It didn't
really snap back or quite die out either. Think ``Lost in Space,''
without Dr. Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the sudden and remarkable comeback: It might be
in your cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   After years of searching for a way to move from its defense
subcontracting past into more commercial markets, Alpha and its
business of supplying high-tech parts for cellular telephones has
driven revenues and the company's stock price. The company's
defense work now accounts for 10 percent of business and continues
to fade.
</P>
<P>
   Alpha shares have soared from 18 3/4 on April 5 to 42 7/8
Tuesday, a climb that made it possible for the company to schedule
a pending sale of 3 million new shares. (Chief executive Thomas
Leonard and other company officials, citing the stock offering,
declined to be interviewed.)
</P>
<P>
   But has Alpha stock gotten ahead of itself? Needham &AMP; Co.
analyst Ryl Ashley initiated coverage of Alpha on May 3 with a buy
recommendation and a 12-month price target of $43 per share. That
target anticipated 26 percent appreciation on a stock that had
already moved sharply higher, but it is just 12.5 cents short of
Tuesday's close.
</P>
<P>
   The Alpha components that have caught the attention of stock
analysts are semiconductors made of gallium arsenide, a combination
of gallium and arsenic molded into a wafer that is lighter and
nearly as strong as silicon.
</P>
<P>
   Alpha began working with gallium arsenide years ago in
connection with military contracts for communication and radar
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Today, digital cell phones are crammed with gallium arsenide
technology. Alpha uses the material to make switches inside the
phones, but more importantly it also manufactures power amplifiers
that improve transmission signals and extend battery life.
</P>
<P>
   Alpha's power amplifiers work inside Motorola's tiny StarTAK
models and its new ultra-small digital V-phones on sale now in
Europe and Asia and soon to hit the US markets.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola's decision to boost production orders for StarTAK cell
phone chips in early April was the fuel that started the Alpha
stock rocket.
</P>
<P>
   But Motorola could be too much of a good thing over time. It is
by far Alpha's largest customer, accounting for 28.1 percent of all
revenues. Ericsson, the company's second-biggest account,
represents 8.2 percent of revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Even Alpha fans like Ashley see the dangers of so much business
concentrated in a single account and what might happen if the
customer decided to go somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Motorola is certainly the biggest part of their comeback story
and Wall Street will be very happy when they have another,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless communications accounts for only about half of Alpha's
business at the moment, but it's growing fast and accounts for the
lion's share of its stock valuation.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless revenues are expected to double to $130 million in the
next two years. Its other two technical divisions are forecast by
some analysts to grow by about $5 million to $67 million over the
next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley justified her original stock growth forecast with a
valuation plan that assigned a relatively pokey 10 times earnings
ratio to Alpha's slower-growing business and a 45 times earnings
multiple to its wireless communication work.
</P>
<P>
   Alpha shareholders have already been rewarded for promise and
the company will surely gain too once it sells new stock at today's
lofty levels. Then it will have to deliver on the potential.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Thud! Nextera Enterprises Inc. of Lexington, Mass., the
management consulting firm backed by the Michael Milken/Larry
Ellison venture Knowledge Universe, went public Tuesday and traded
down. Nextera shares fell 1 1/16 to 8 15/16 on its first day of
trading. The company raised $115 million in its initial public
offering.

CHINA'S LOVE-HATE FOR US ENDURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ When President Clinton charmed his way through China
last year, praising the Chinese and pledging growing friendship,
the joke here was that he had unseated basketball star Michael
Jordan as China's favorite American.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after NATO's errant bombing of the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade, Clinton suddenly became Enemy Number One. The
state-controlled media and ordinary people alike denounced him as a
murderer and condemned the United States as a ``hegemonist'' power
intent on dominating China.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after four days, furious anti-American protests involving as
many as 400,000 people in 20 cities subsided. That is mostly
because authorities who first encouraged the rock-throwing
demonstrations decided to halt them. But it is also true that the
worst public vitriol seems to have drained away. Here in the
capital, calls to boycott American goods have gone largely unheeded
and Americans are walking the streets unbothered. Greatly
diminished are the angry taunts of a week ago, when numerous
Americans were chastised by strangers.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first time the pendulum of Chinese public opinion
has swung radically against the United States, nor is it likely to
be the last. But while it will take time and considerable effort to
rebuild the damaged relationship between the governments in Beijing
and Washington, ordinary Chinese people's sentiments toward America
may be quicker to heal.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is both admired and resented here, reflecting
a love-hate relationship between the Chinese public and all things
American. To be sure, Chinese people are genuinely furious about
the bombing; almost anyone from laborers to professors believes the
attack was an intentional plot to bully their nation, and the
government has fed that belief by delaying news of Clinton's
apology. But while suspicion of all foreign powers runs deep in
China, true hatred of Americans is rare.
</P>
<P>
   There are many practical reasons for that. American investment
creates jobs and brings technology to China. The United States is
China's second-largest trading partner, and tourism by Americans
feeds millions of dollars into the economy.
</P>
<P>
   At a MacDonald's restaurant, filled Tuesday with its usual
lunchtime Chinese crowd, cashier Qin Lin reasoned that ``American
companies did nothing wrong. This has nothing to do with American
business or American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond economics, there are more subtle reasons for the
conflicted views of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feelings of nationalism and cosmopolitanism are very
complicated in China. A lot of China's problems in the last 150
years since the Opium War have come from weakness to the outside
world,'' said Shi Jinghuan, a professor of education at Beijing
Normal University. ``People want to learn high technology from
Western countries, but they feel unhappy when the country we most
want to learn from doesn't treat us the way we want to be
treated.''
</P>
<P>
   Much in the way that India feels disrespected and denied its
rightful place in world affairs _ prompting it to test nuclear
devices to prove its muscle last year, China has long felt put down
by foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese schoolchildren are taught that after 5,000 years of
proud history, a weak China was humiliated and colonized in the
19th and 20th centuries. Communist China, founded in 1949, was then
isolated and marginalized for decades, largely by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of pride mixed with inferiority runs deep; Chinese are
taught that their ancestors invented paper, printing, gunpowder,
and the compass, but that foreigners applied those inventions in
modern, useful ways. Belief in the superiority of Chinese
civilization, coupled with the shame of being subjugated by outside
``barbarians,'' has fed xenophobia and nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Technology and modern ideas are seen as the ticket to catching
up with the West. But adopting select concepts while retaining
``Chinese characteristics'' is not always easy, leaving many here
with feelings of envy and resentment.
</P>
<P>
   American products are best-sellers here; they are considered the
height of modernity, but evoke frustration that Chinese technology
and design has not matched America's. American television, movies,
and music are hugely popular and widely imitated, but are also
resented for sidelining traditional culture. American liberties are
admired and envied, but also suspected of feeding crime, divorce,
and a host of social ills more prevalent in the West than in a
nation that has been regimented and isolated for most of its
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't really hate Americans. It's like love _ you can't
explain why,'' said a 29-year-old man who works for a US company.
``I felt embarrassed to shout `Down with America' this week. Ever
since the Open Door policy, America has become the symbol of
freedom, high technology, the good life, modernity, excitement. . .
. Some people spend many years waiting for a visa to go to the US.
So when we say we hate America, it's not really deep-seated.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, hatred of Japan, which colonized China and perpetrated
wartime atrocities, comes far more naturally to many Chinese than
anti-Americanism.
</P>
<P>
   In one protest in front of the US Embassy last week, a tired
student leader accidentally shouted, ``Down with the Japanese'' _
and her classmates automatically echoed the call. When she tried to
correct herself, one shouted, ``That's OK. The Japanese are worse.
Down with the Japanese!''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese leaders have long stoked suspicion of foreign nations,
and the NATO bombing offered a perfect example of a supposed plot
against China. Meanwhile, allegations of Chinese misdeeds, such as
the theft of American military secrets, are not reported in the
press, promoting a one-sided view.
</P>
<P>
   In one of countless similar commentaries, the People's Daily
said Friday that Western powers led by the United States are using
``political, economic, military and diplomatic means to obstruct
and destroy China's development.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a powerful message, but as contact with foreigners and
access to the outside world expands, not everyone is buying it.
</P>
<P>
   Deng Zaoheng, 55, a housewife, said the bombing, though
horrible, hasn't turned her against the United States. ``We still
hope relations between China and the US will continue developing,''
she said. ``We need each other.''

 BOSTON: ... Boston stadium.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On March 15, another key development occurred, not in New
England, but in Phoenix, where NFL owners voted to change league
policy to foster internal funding of stadium projects. Finneran
felt vindicated. And the door to bringing the Patriots back home
opened a little wider.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really a key turning point,'' Finneran said
recently.``It meant the league might be willing to participate. And
it was a tacit acceptance of what the House had argued all along:
that those who stood to benefit from a new stadium, like the NFL
owners, also had to participate in funding it.''
</P>
<P>
   A month later, the Boston group -- now consisting of Kirk,
Monan, Boston Edison chairman Thomas J. May, Budd, and Connell --
began crafting an opinion piece to be published in the Globe. The
draft, articulating broad backing for keeping the team, was
circulated on Beacon Hill in advance so leaders would not be
stunned when they opened their papers April 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest is history,'' Kirk said. ``This thing just
unfolded.''
</P>
<P>
   The article triggered strong statements of support, most
importantly from Beacon Hill, and unexpectedly positive statements
from the mayor saying he was open-minded. Privately, though, it
soon became clear Menino still did not want a stadium in Boston, so
the group began focusing on Foxborough, the Patriots' base since
1971.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Birmingham, the Senate president and a former labor
negotiator, called Kirk at home, urging a face-to-face summit on
Beacon Hill the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way I figured we might be able to get this done was
to all sit down in the same room and hammer it out,'' Birmingham
said. ``So that's what we proposed.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It all came together, quite literally in the 11th hour _ on
Tuesday, April 27, at 11:35 p.m., to be exact.
</P>
<P>
   The state's power troika emerged from a three-hour meeting with
a plan that could upend everything the team planned and Hartford's
dream of becoming an NFL city.
</P>
<P>
   The seed planted by Kirk and Rooney nearly five months earlier
had sprouted in this cluster of leadership gathered in Birmingham's
cavernous office, paneled with Honduran Mahogany and draped in
patinated yellow and green fabric.
</P>
<P>
   At one end of the 12-foot antique table sat the House speaker,
Finneran. Birmingham sat at the other. Seated on blue-leather
chairs between them were Kirk, Governor Cellucci, Lieutenant
Governor Jane Swift, aides to all three political leaders,
stadium-expert Goodell, and another NFL executive, Neil Glat.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second night in a row the group had met in
Birmingham's office. The first evening, there was a lot of
posturing. By the second night, it was clear everyone was working
toward a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Except there was a sticking point: Finneran's demand that the
Patriots pay up to $2 million a year to cover some of the state's
costs for road, sewer, and other public infrastructure work
required at a new Foxboro Stadium. NFL officials balked, noting
that should be the state's responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   A tense standoff ensued, and for a few minutes it looked like
the deal could die.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by the impasse, Cellucci, a strong supporter of a new
stadium for the Patriots, sided with Finneran. Still, NFL officials
insisted they couldn't agree to the payback language. To keep the
momentum of the talks going, Birmingham asked Kirk and the NFL men
to wait in another room while the three political leaders discussed
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   After about 30 minutes, they were invited back in, presented
with the the final plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a general feeling that this was it,'' Birmingham
said later. ``The deal was as good as it was going to get.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL signed on.
</P>
<P>
   Under the offer, drafted into the legislation that passed
Tuesday, Kraft would build the stadium, partially assisted by
low-rate NFL financing. The state would provide $70 million in
infrastructure improvements around Route 1. Further, Kraft would
grant an easement on his land, allowing the state to upgrade access
ramps and sewer lines on his private property.
</P>
<P>
   Several people involved in the negotiations claim credit for the
easement plan. But whoever promoted the idea, it broke the
stalemate by eliminating the land purchase component of the
Senate's last plan, which Finneran opposed, while preserving
infrastructure spending that the team deemed necessary.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Massachusetts moved closer to a counteroffer, Connecticut
fell behind.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, on Thursday, April 29, a team of Patriots
consultants delivered a prognosis that put the Hartford deal in
critical condition: the stadium, they concluded, most likely could
not be ready by 2002, as promised, because it would take longer to
clear the site of the steam plant and scrub it of environmental
contamination. Under the stadium contract, that was enough for the
team to walk away without penalty, as long as it made the decision
by the upcoming Sunday, May 2.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft faced a choice: wait at least another year for the
Hartford stadium or take his chances in Massachusetts, where a plan
was now on the table but had not received full legislative
approval.
</P>
<P>
   That night, Kraft, his son Jonathan, and team executive Andy
Wasynczuk flew to Hartford to see if a third option was possible:
Would Connecticut extended the penalty-free deadline another month,
by which time a more definitive review of the site could be
completed?
</P>
<P>
   Rowland refused. Mostly, the governor couldn't believe the team
would really turn their backs on a free stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a game of high stakes poker'' said one person who was
in the room.``And I think the governor was calling the team's
bluff.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, furious and desperate, gave Kraft just 24 hours to
decide _ even though Kraft legally had several days to make up his
mind. The meeting ended. They all left the governor's office to
face a throng of reporters camped outside and issued sober, but
vague, statements about being committed to their ``goal'' of the
Patriots playing in Hartford by 2002. They shook hands as cameras
clicked and went their separate ways.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a final parting.
</P>
<P>
   Consultants for both sides stayed up well into Friday morning,
trying to salvage the agreement, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, the Krafts got a final consultants' report.
</P>
<P>
   With a void of good news, Robert Kraft retreated to his office
on the 34th floor of a Boston skyscraper to fax the formal
termination notice to Connecticut. He called Rowland as it was
being transmitted.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Kraft and Wasynczuk left the room. It was a painful and
emotional conversation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, in Los Angeles promoting Massachusetts film
production, was chatting with renowned chef Wolfgang Puck, about to
make a cheese, tomato, and pepper pizza, when news of the stunning
about-face broke.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, Cellucci would be on the set of ``The Tonight
Show.'' Jay Leno, originally from the Boston area, gave a nod to
the governor during his opening monologue, asking him what was
happening with the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   The camera, beaming the program to some 6 million viewers, spun
around toward the audience where Cellucci sat smiling with his
thumb in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're staying,'' the governor shouted, ``in Massachusetts!''

IN PATRIOTS DEAL, ALL ROADS LED BACK TO FOXBOROUGH 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY AND MEG VAILLANCOURT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- It took just one day to debate and approve a bill that
will keep the New England Patriots in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday's vote may never have happened if a couple of old
friends had not bumped into each other in a Washington hotel
ballroom last December _ an encounter that sparked a nearly
six-month campaign to keep the team from moving to Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   At a dinner honoring Nobel Peace Prize winners David Trimble and
John Hume, Boston attorney Paul G. Kirk Jr., former chairman of the
Democratic National Committee, spotted his pal, Pittsburgh Steelers
president Daniel Rooney, an outspoken critic of National Football
League franchises leaving their home markets for smaller ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went over and gave him a little tease about the NFL
referees'' making bad calls, said Kirk, one of more than two dozen
people interviewed for this story. ``He said, `Well, what are you
going to do about getting the Patriots to go back to
Massachusetts?' We talked about it a little bit, the dismay...''
</P>
<P>
   ``It did go from there,'' Rooney said, referring to the mostly
secret efforts that resulted in Tuesday's legislation being
forwarded to Governor Paul Cellucci for his signature. ``I will
admit that.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, at a meeting of a small group of NFL owners
in Chicago, Rooney listened as team owner Robert Kraft chronicled
the Patriots three-year quest for a new stadium. Blocked from
building in Boston itself, the team flirted with Providence while
Massachusetts legislators argued into a dead end over a proposal
Kraft and Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham had put together.
Then, Connecticut came acourting.
</P>
<P>
   Rooney was stupefied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know business guys in Boston,'' Rooney reportedly said, his
mind reverting back to his talk with Kirk. ``And I know they don't
want this to happen.... I really can't imagine they will let this
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Hartford looked like a done deal on Nov. 19, when Kraft
stood in the ornate Judiciary Room of Connecticut's Capitol,
signing a ``memorandum of understanding'' with Governor John G.
Rowland. The document was a plan to move the team from the one of
the oldest stadiums in the nation to a new one in downtown
Hartford, centerpiece of a $1 billion rejuvenation project for the
ailing insurance city.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft, there with his son, Jonathan, had tears in his eyes.
Although he felt welcomed by the cheering crowd and pleased with
what would be the richest deal ever offered an NFL team, sadness
and disappointment at leaving his home state were also evident on
his face.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Dec. 15 _ days after the Kirk-Rooney encounter _ the
Connecticut General Assembly passed legislation authorizing $374
million for a stadium, public infrastructure, and maintenance of
the facility, where the state university's football squad would
also play.
</P>
<P>
   But Rooney and Kirk, longtime friends through Irish charity
circles, were already working the phones. The Steelers president
started with NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue, along with Roger
Goodell, the league's stadium expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I talked to Father Monan next,'' Rooney said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. J. Donald Monan, the chancellor of Boston College who
helped broker the FleetCenter deal, was a significant force among
the widening group of mostly Irish Catholic executives trying to
spread the faith that the Patriots could be saved for the Bay
State. He gave Rooney some names of people to call, including
advertising executive John J. Connors Jr. and industrialist William
F. Connell, both of whom would become part of the inner core of
civic leaders _ known as ``Operation Team Back'' _ rallying the
business community to purchase luxury seating if and when a new
stadium got built.
</P>
<P>
   Equally significant, Monan bestowed inspiration for what seemed
like an impossible feat at that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Father Monan was very important, giving me encouragement that
it could be done. I have a lot of respect for him,'' added Rooney,
whose son attended Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk, soft-spoken, persuasive, and once considered for the NFL
commissioner's job _ which ultimately went to his friend Tagliabue
_ had also sprung into action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Paul Tagliabue. I remember saying, `You know, I'm
glad to be helpful, but no one wants to embark on a fool's errand.'
''
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner assured Kirk that developing a Massachusetts
alternative would be worthwhile. And by Jan. 6, Goodell was in
Boston, where Kirk introduced him to the civic group in his
Sullivan &AMP; Worcester law office.
</P>
<P>
   Goodell, with a background in economics and business, was
responsible for getting stadiums built from Seattle to Tampa.
However, this deal would not be as easy as the rest.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Kraft's accord with Rowland prohibited the owner
from talking with another state. That meant Operation Team Back
would have to pull together a proposal without consulting the team,
something they insist they did to prevent exposing Kraft to a
lawsuit by Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Second, there was the seemingly intractable position of House
Speaker Thomas M. Finneran. The Mattapan Democrat refused to
compromise on Senate legislation last year offering as much as $20
million for land and $52 million for infrastructure improvements
around Foxboro Stadium, ultimately halting legislative action and
pushing a tired and frustrated Kraft into Connecticut's hungry
grasp.
</P>
<P>
   But as the son of Charles E. Goodell, the US Senator from New
York who replaced the assassinated Robert F. Kennedy, Roger Goodell
understood politics. And he knew navigating them would be key to an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   So at their first meeting, Goodell quoted local favorite Tip
O'Neill as saying: ``There's always a solution if you give other
people credit for it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But many factors contributed to the turn of events, including
missteps and overconfidence on Connecticut's part and the NFL's
growing concern about franchises being lured to smaller cities with
stadium bait. Within a month of that state's approval for an
open-air facility, there were signs -- some public and some private
-- of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   At their January Super Bowl press conferences, Tagliabue and
Gene Upshaw, head of the NFL Players Association, made it clear
they weren't thrilled about the Patriots' proposed move. Hartford's
smaller television market would mean less broadcast revenue shared
among the teams.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Kraft was starting to hear that clearing the
Hartford site of a steam plant would be more complicated than
Rowland had let on.
</P>
<P>
   So he paid a visit to the freshly reelected governor.
</P>
<P>
   Behind closed doors at Rowland's gubernatorial mansion in
January, Kraft made it clear he was worried about meeting a 2002
season opening after already extending the original 2001 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   As a fire crackled in the background, Rowland looked Kraft in
the eye and said he was putting his best people on the project. He
said the state would meet the goal. Indeed, the young Republican
governor was so confident, he gave the team an easy escape: If, by
May 2, the team did not feel the stadium could be completed on time
and within budget, the Patriots could walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy is a charming, big-picture guy who thinks the people
around him are competent enough to handle the details,'' one
Connecticut lobbyist said of Rowland. ``I don't think he was well
served and hasn't been for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some outside Rowland's inner core have been calling the
Connecticut site crew the ``Junior Varsity Squad,'' a well-meaning
group ill-equipped to handle a project of such complication and
magnitude. It took them months to figure out a way to clear the
steam plant -- responsible for heating and cooling most of downtown
Hartford -- and environmental tests had still not been completed.
</P>
<P>
   All of that made outsiders smell weakness with the deal even as
Rowland and Kraft remained publicly committed to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Boston group began quietly visiting key
officials, including Finneran and Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino,
who had vehemently opposed Kraft's previous plan for a South Boston
stadium.

EPA STUDY WARNS OF TOXIC DANGERS IN HUDSON RIVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELIZABETH BENJAMIN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Contaminated sediments will continue to be a
major source of PCBs in the upper Hudson River for years to come,
and fish in some areas will remain unsafe to eat for at least a
decade if nothing is done to clean up the problem, according to a
study released by the Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   These findings, based on a computer model that projects 21 years
into the future, contradict some conclusions in a study made public
last week by the General Electric Co. The GE study, which also used
computer modeling, showed that some fish between Fort Edward and
the Troy Dam, both in upstate New York, will be fit for consumption
by next year if the river continues to naturally cleanse itself by
covering PCBs with sediment.
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials said Tuesday that their projection indicates that
erosion, or scour, occurring during low-flow river conditions is an
important source of PCBs in the water. The erosion could be caused
by the churning of sediments by boat propellers and organisms or
wind, according to the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   GE used PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, for about three
decades as an insulator in electric capacitors. The company legally
discharged more than one million pounds of the chemicals into the
river before the chemicals were banned in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   GE says it has spent millions of dollars to remove some of the
PCBs it discharged.
</P>
<P>
   According to the EPA model, a 100-year flood would not
substantially increase the concentrations of PCBs in fish and that
water columns and surface sediment will get 50 percent cleaner
every 10 years. However, largemouth bass above Stillwater will not
meet the minimum Food and Drug Administration contamination level
of two-parts-per-million for commercial fishing until 2008 at the
earliest, the EPA study found.
</P>
<P>
   They would not meet the Great Lakes Sport Fishing Advisory for
more than 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether people can safely eat the fish depends on what the
definition of safe is. Some would say that 2 ppm is not safe,''
said Trina von Stackelberg of Menzie-Cura Associates, the
Massachusetts firm that created the government's computer model.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas J. Tomchuk, Hudson River PCBs site project manager for
the EPA, said the study based on this model was only one step
toward making a final decision on whether to require GE to dredge
the riverbed to remove PCBs. The next public step in the process
comes in August, when an EPA assessment of the PCB contamination on
human health will be released.
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials said they had not yet reviewed the GE study at
length and would not comment on it Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   GE spokesman Mark Behan said he had not yet seen the EPA study
but again called for a review by independent scientists of the
findings by both the agency and GE. The corporation maintains that
the river has been recovering naturally over the past 20 years and
will continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will give (the EPA study) a careful review, just as we hope
they will give ours a careful review,'' Behan said. ``If a panel
reviewed both models simultaneously, the EPA and the public would
get the benefit of having more science rather than less.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Sweeney, R-N.Y., on Tuesday said he would ask the
General Accounting Office to impanel a team of scientists to
provide independent scrutiny of the two studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``With competing studies available, each with conflicting
results, it's hard to tell which science is credible,'' Sweeney
said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   GE has assumed that if the EPA ordered dredging, it would not
likely begin before 2005 and would take seven to 11 years to
complete. Dredging the upper river could potentially cost hundreds
of millions of dollars.

INVESTORS MAY SOON TRADE SLEEP FOR STOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Coffee in hand, Mike Branham sits at the computer
at 5 each morning to scan the Motley Fool, Raging Bull, and other
Internet financial news sites. The CNBC stock ticker scrolls across
his television all day. At 1 a.m., he might wae up to check the
market news from Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his round-the-clock attention to stocks, Branham and
other small investors can actually trade shares only 6 1/2 hours a
day, when the US exchanges are open. But with so many people now
playing the stock market, the two main exchanges, the New York
Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, are facing the reality that the
traditional trading day is just too short.
</P>
<P>
   Now, both exchanges, in the first of what could be profound
changes in the way stocks are bought and sold, are planning to add
extra sessions so that people can trade stocks before and after
work.
</P>
<P>
   And that is only one step in a coming revolution. Driven by a
huge boom in stock trading over the Internet, a handful of private
companies say they will offer nighttime and even 24-hour stock
trading on what are essentially private stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   For years, mutual fund managers, pension fund managers, and
other big-money players have been able to trade before the opening
bell at 9:30 a.m. and after the close at 4 p.m. As the
democratization of the market continues, the new private exchanges
promise to give the same power to the small investor.
</P>
<P>
   Late-night stock trading might seem like welcome news for
Branham and the millions of other Americans who have made the stock
market an important part of their lives. But many people are not
sure it is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would wreak havoc on my life,'' says Branham, a Houston
events planner and confessed ``equities addict,'' who is scaling
back after making 800 trades last year. The stock market ``just
about drove me nuts'' as it is. ``Nighttime trading,'' he said,
``would be overload.''
</P>
<P>
   Even less-active investors fear they will lose sleep if they
have to worry about their portfolios tanking in late-night trading.
``Right now, when the market closes you have time to eat dinner and
spend some time with your family,'' said Dennis Fortier, a former
Maine resident and product manager who now lives in San Clemente,
Calif. ``If it's a 24-hour thing, I'm not sure people will know how
to handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, much of the financial services industry says
late-hours trading will be a big hit. Their evidence: The bull
market has pushed the volume of stocks changing hands each day to
record highs. And, more important, a huge number of those trades
are being placed by on-line investors using ETrade, Ameritrade,
Suretrade, and more than 100 other Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   These investors place their orders by computer to an automated
service center, rather than over the phone to a live broker.
On-line brokerages did not even exist in 1994. Today, an estimated
14 percent of all trades, or one in seven, start with an investor
hitting a few keys on a personal computer. Brokerages are opening
15,000 on-line accounts each day.
</P>
<P>
   Just as ATMs allowed banks to save money on tellers, on-line
brokerages can operate so cheaply that it is cost-effective for
them to stay open at night. Last month, Instinet, a 30-year-old
service that allows mutual fund managers and other big investors to
make after-hours trades, announced that it would open its doors to
small investors this year.
</P>
<P>
   Island, a private exchange that has become one of the largest
forums for trading Intel, Dell, and Amazon.com, already operates
from 8 a.m. to 5:15 p.m. and has boasted that it will stay open all
night by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The push for late-night trading is also driven by recent rules
changes from the Securities and Exchange Commission and by the
growth of financial news reporting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, when you came home at night and wanted to look
at your investments, you read the paper or looked at your
statements when they came in the mail,'' says Douglas Atkin, chief
executive of Instinet. ``And you really couldn't act on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Internet is full of financial news sites, giving
people the kind of analysis and statistical information that was
once restricted to brokers. CNBC broadcasts financial news all day
on television _ including earnings news and other reports that
companies tend to announce after the markets close.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 40 percent of all on-line orders come in after market
hours. Tremendous numbers of people are shopping, but the store is
closed,'' said Michael Satow, a former government securities lawyer
who cofounded IndivEx, an after-hours trading service that plans to
debut this summer. Its slogan: ``The market's still open.''
</P>
<P>
   Instinet, Island, and at least seven other private exchanges
already trade shares during the day, accounting for nearly
one-third of the trading in certain high-tech companies. Each
operates by its own rules, but they are fundamentally different
than the major exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   All trades on Nasdaq and some on the NYSE involve middlemen. On
Nasdaq especially, investors, through their brokerage firms, buy
stock from the middleman, who keeps a large inventory of a certain
stock or set of stocks on hand. When investors sell stock, the
middleman is the buyer.
</P>
<P>
   The middleman, known on Nasdaq as a market maker, turns a profit
by selling shares for a little more money than the buying price.
For example, an investor might have to pay $78.50 to buy a share of
Microsoft Corp. at a given moment, but he or she could sell it back
at only $78.44.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the buying and selling price, called the
spread, can be as high as 5 percent or even more for some stocks.
That means someone who buys the stock must wait for it to rise 5
percent just to break even.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new exchanges say they will cut the middleman and
match buyers and sellers directly. This will lower the spread, they
say, and cut the cost of each trade.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody who wants to sell shares of Microsoft Corp. at $80, for
example, can post the offer on one of the new exchange services. If
someone else has already offered to buy at that price, the service
closes the sale. Or, if the only buyer on hand is willing to pay
only $78, the buyer and seller could be matched up to negotiate a
price.
</P>
<P>
   The reality may turn out to be something less. Some analysts say
that many buyers who look for a seller late at night will find
nobody around _ especially if he or she wants to buy one of the
less-popular stocks. Even now, the new exchanges cannot find a
buyer for every daytime sell order they receive, forcing them to
send those orders into the regular Nasdaq system to be filled by a
market maker.
</P>
<P>
   That is why some of the new services, at least to start, will
close shop at 9 p.m. or so and are limiting themselves to the most
popular stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the new services have the major exchanges worried. NYSE
officials have said they are in talks to buy one of the new
networks, or may build their own.
</P>
<P>
   The officials have also said that by mid-2000 or sooner, the
NYSE will add an early morning and evening session. Nasdaq might
add a four-hour evening session.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the new exchanges could present a formidable challenge
to Nasdaq, says Bill Burnham, who follows the brokerage industry
for Credit Suisse First Boston. In a recent report, he predicted
that the new services would soon dominate the trading of
high-volume, popular stocks, leaving the Nasdaq market makers to
specialize only in more marginal shares.
</P>
<P>
   For the NYSE, the boom in electronic investing might also
highlight the costs of its crowded trading floor. Exchange
officials say their system still gives investors the best price for
shares.
</P>
<P>
   But the 96-year-old trading floor is becoming one of the last of
its breed. The major European exchanges are all electronic. Sydney
Futures Exchange estimates that it will cut costs by 40 percent by
switching to electronic trading. Just last month, the Tokyo Stock
Exchange closed its trading floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New York Stock Exchange is a dinosaur,'' said Richard
Roll, a finance professor at the University of California at Los
Angeles. ``These electronic systems are much more efficient.
There's no reason for people to be physically located on the floor
of an exchange. It's a waste of resources.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, investors seem to have mixed feelings about
the coming world of round-the-clock stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jarrett, a Providence, R.I. high school teacher, said he
would probably use an after-hours service because his job keeps him
from checking the markets during the day. Still, he added in an
e-mail exchange, ``I just think for everyone's sanity, the market
needs to have an opening and a closing every day.''

BREAST CANCER RECOMMENDATION FACES CRITICISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARSHA GINSBURG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Advocates for breast cancer patients denounced a
leading group of cancer specialists for recommending that doctors
offer the widely debated drug tamoxifen to healthy women worried
about developing breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation was issued Tuesday by the American Society of
Clinical Oncology at its annual meeting in Atlanta. It was based
largely on earlier research that indicated tamoxifen cuts almost in
half some women's risk of developing the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But the drug has been criticized by many advocates of breast
cancer patients because of the side effects caused by the
medication. Tamoxifen has been linked to hot flashes and increased
risk of uterine cancer and potentially fatal blood clots.
</P>
<P>
   The lead doctors writing Tuesday's statement said a woman's fear
of breast cancer is perhaps the most important consideration in
deciding whether to take the drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not recommending that women take it. We are
recommending that women be offered it,'' said Dr. Rowan Chlebowski
of the University of California at Los Angeles, the co-chair of the
committee of cancer specialists.
</P>
<P>
   The move was denounced by Barbara Brenner, head of Breast Cancer
Action in San Francisco, who attended the conference. She said she
was outraged at oncologists' hypocrisy for suggesting the drug be
offered without actually recommending it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This statement will make a woman's decision more difficult,
not easier,'' Brenner said. ``How in God's name do they make a
distinction about whether to offer it or whether to recommend
taking it? Do they not think that women rely on their doctors?''
</P>
<P>
   Chlebowski said the decision to use tamoxifen ``depends on a
woman's actual risk and the importance of that risk to her.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's recommendation said tamoxifen may be offered to
women who have at least a 1.7 percent relative risk _ meaning
nearly double the average risk _ of getting breast cancer over the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Crawford, a genetic counselor at the University of
California at San Francisco, said that figure means a woman has a
24 percent chance of contracting the disease over her lifetime. The
average U.S. woman's chances of developing breast cancer in her
lifetime is 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   About 29 million women, or 20 percent of the U.S. female
population, are in the 1.7 percent relative-risk category,
including all women over 60.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford said fear of getting the disease would likely make
high-risk women seriously consider taking the drug, but that they
needed to weigh the risks against the benefits. Like many genetics
specialists, Crawford said she believes most women overestimate
their chances of developing breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In Marin, the Nothern California county that has the highest
rate of breast cancer in the country, the head of Marin Breast
Cancer Watch did not agree with the recommendation on tamoxifen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Healthy women should be putting healthy things into their
bodies, not toxic substances,'' said Francine Levien, president of
the group. ``This is going to make millions of dollars for the
company that owns this. Do I think it's a political issue? Yes, I
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The medication is being marketed by the British-Swedish drug
manufacturer AstraZeneca Plc.

STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK CAMPUS IN ALBANY SEES BIG GROWTH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 &HT;     c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST GREENBUSH, N.Y. _ The State University of New York at
Albany's east campus here was an abandoned site just four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's undergoing explosive growth.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago a major expansion was announced by Albany
Molecular Research. On Wednesday the state Department of
Environmental Conservation (DEC) announced the relocation of six
laboratories to the site, adding 30 to 50 jobs to the 350 there at
18 organizations, university officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Taconic Biotechnology, a company on the campus for two years, is
also planning to grow by more than 50 percent _ to about 45
employees _ in a 17,500-square-foot space, said managing director
Todd Little. Taconic expects to be in the new facility within six
months.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the university plans to establish within the next
month a center for gene studies on the east campus. The center will
collaborate on a project with Taconic and Albany Medical College to
manipulate genes in mice and study the genes' potential effect on
human health, said Albert Millis, a university biology professor
and co-director of the planned Center for Comparative Functional
Genomics.
</P>
<P>
   It will cost about $2.8 million to establish the center, Millis
said, and another $300,000 to $500,000 for the joint venture,
called a transgenic animal facility. The three partners will share
in the cost.
</P>
<P>
   The university has operated the campus in East Greenbush for the
last three years, when it purchased the 58-acre site with the help
of a $5 million state grant.
</P>
<P>
   The goal has been to develop the campus as a center that would
encourage collaborations between the school and businesses,
especially in biotechnology and pharmacy. The university's School
of Public Health, with about 300 students, is also located at the
site.
</P>
<P>
   The new DEC labs won't provide a net gain of jobs in the Albany
region but will consolidate facilities scattered throughout the
area.
</P>
<P>
   DEC scientists will support the agency's air, water and solid
and hazardous waste divisions and work on research initiatives with
staff from UAlbany's Atmospheric Sciences Research Center. DEC and
university scientists have worked together previously.
</P>
<P>
   Taconic's expansion is driven by growth in its technology
service division, Little said. The company is a subsidiary of
Taconic Farms of Germantown. N.Y. Taconic Biotech provides support
for Taconic Farms, which breeds laboratory rats and mice.
</P>
<P>
   The East Greenbush division's expansion would also support work
expected from the transgenic animal facility, Little said. The
joint venture expects to attract both contract work and research
dollars, Millis said.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Albany Molecular announced it would build an $11
million, 25,000-square-foot manufacturing facility to produce small
batches of pharmaceuticals at the east campus. The expansion is
expected to bring 150 jobs to East Greenbush over three years.

   w/ JOURNAL-KOSOVO _ KUKES, Albania _ In fiction, Casablanca had
Rick's American Cafe. In fact, Beirut had the Commodore Hotel bar.
Every war has its meeting place for spies, mercenaries, diplomats,
correspondents and drunks. Kukes has the Bar Amerika, a place so
bizarre you may think it's fiction, but indeed it is fact. In one
corner, a geurrilla fighter from the Bronx is about to join the KLA
at the front. In another, aid workers discuss their latest strategy
for delivering food aid, while the local mobsters at another table
openly brag about how much of it they've stolen. (Holmes, Cox News

   SAFRICA-CELLPHONES _ JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Naomi Shaku
lives in the Ebony Park neighborhood on the east side of
Johannesburg, a development of tiny government-built houses whose
single rooms are smaller than a rich man's bathroom. These homes
were built to house people who previously lived in squatter camps.
These are the poor, people who have precious little in life. Shaku,
24, may not have much. But she does have a cell phone. And so, it
seems, does almost everyone else in South Africa. (Melvin, Atlanta

   KIDNEY-FOR-COP _ ATLANTA _ When DeKalb County Assistant Police
Chief Melvin Ferguson was told he needed a kidney from a type O
positive donor, he remembered a bloody crime scene. The wounded
killer's blood type was O positive. By then, Larry Grant Lonchar
was on death row. He agreed to Ferguson's request for a kidney,
setting up an international debate over whether death row inmates
could allow their organs to be harvested and choose to die on an
operating room table rather than by lethal injection or
electrocution. Lonchar lost the debate and was executed. But one
day later, Ferguson received a kidney transplant from a woman whose
life he had saved when he was a young police officer. Ferguson died
Monday. But his donated kidney, said donor Gina Pittman, ``kept
right on working until his last breath.'' (McDonald, Atlanta

 &HT;    BARAK REVIVES RABIN'S LEGACY WITH ELECTION VICTORY, COMMENTS

 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (k) Commentary categories.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ When the results of the 1996 Israeli elections came
in, just six months after Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's
assassination, I cried.
</P>
<P>
   Two days ago, as I watched thousands of Israelis celebrating the
results of the 1999 elections in Yitzhak Rabin Square, I cried
again.
</P>
<P>
   It was in that downtown Tel Aviv plaza -- then called King's of
Israel Square -- that Rabin was murdered at a peace rally I
attended.
</P>
<P>
   Months later I was shedding tears of disbelief that over 50
percent of my fellow Israelis voted for Benjamin Netanyahu -- a
leader of the vicious campaign against Rabin and the Oslo Peace
accords.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Israelis, the 1996 elections hit me like a second
assassination: First we lost a beloved leader, then we lost the
chance to continue in his path -- the path of peace and true
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Over the ensuing three years of Netanyahu's government, Rabin
became a powerful symbol for me and many other Israelis. He
symbolized everything we wanted our country to be but felt it was
losing. During Netanyahu's term, the peace process was effectively
halted, the religious nationalists gained power, and the country
seemed to be moving more toward a theocracy than a liberal
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the slick, media-savvy Netanyahu, Rabin seemed more
and more like a dinosaur: coarse, short-tempered and heavy-tongued,
but a man of integrity and total devotion to his country. Netanyahu
seemed determined to make Rabin's era recede rapidly into ancient
history.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for Netanyahu, Rabin was anathema.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who continued to mourn Rabin took it as a personal
affront every time Netanyahu purposely failed to mention him: in
his victory speech just months after Rabin's murder; when he signed
the Hebron peace agreement in 1997; and then the Wye River
Memorandum last fall. Netanyahu's deliberate detachment from
anything Rabin-related made me and many Israelis feel completely
alienated from him as a person and a leader.
</P>
<P>
   For us, Ehud Barak's victory over Netanyahu in the prime
minister's race signifies a return to Rabin's way. Barak himself
emphasized his role as Rabin's successor in his victory speech in
Rabin Square after Monday's vote and again Tuesday at Rabin's
grave.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Yitzhak Rabin Square was the natural place for
celebrating Barak's victory. That's why tens of thousands of
Israelis came together there in a spontaneous outpouring of relief
and joy. That's why I cried when I saw on television the large
posters of Rabin they waved. The memory of Rabin that had been
trampled on and repressed for 3-1/2 years was finally redeemed.
</P>
<P>
   Standing before the crowd in the early hours of Tuesday, Barak
said, ``I came here to Rabin Square, to the place where our hearts
were broken, when a stone blocked the gate, just when we were about
to embark on a new era.''
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who had stood in the square years ago with Rabin now
hope that stone has been removed and the new era can begin.

 &HT;    `Parade' score a thrilling original
 &HT;    By Kathy Janich
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first sound you hear is the rhythmic rat-tat-tat of a
military drum. Then a plaintive tenor _ a Rebel soldier _ sings
softly of the old red hills of home, a Georgia ``where honor lives
and breathes.''
</P>
<P>
   The song continues, but the scene changes. It's 1913, and the
Confederate Memorial Day Parade has begun. That hopeful soldier is
50 years older, his voice deeper and sadder.
</P>
<P>
   So begins ``Parade,'' the Alfred Uhry-Jason Robert Brown musical
that lasted only weeks but is now collecting plenty of
end-of-season accolades. The show portrays 1913 Georgia as a land
of dishonor, where a young Mary Phagan is strangled, where Yankee
Jew Leo Frank is railroaded for the crime and where any number of
Southerners find the pull of a private agenda more intoxicating
than the search for truth.
</P>
<P>
   Tough stuff for a musical? Yes, but as exciting as it is
devastating. ``Parade'' is one of the finest Broadway scores in
recent years, performed by thrilling theater singers and given
backbone by a chorus that can soar or sting or break into harmonies
so potent your eyes will moisten.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, in his Broadway debut, has crafted odes, hymns, marches
and more for characters who show cracks as well as courage. When
Lucille Frank (Carolee Carmello) spits out ``You Don't Know This
Man'' to a crowd of accusers, she fights to control her outrage as
she tells them how little they do know. When Leo (Brent Carver)
sings of being an outsider (``How Can I Call This Home?''), his
longing for Brooklyn where ``people look like I do and talk like I
do'' is urgent and unfulfillable. When reporter Britt Craig (Evan
Pappas) heralds ``Big News'' to the plinkety-plank of a barroom
piano, it's clear his thirst for booze long ago liquefied his need
for facts.
</P>
<P>
   This is a remarkable recording, one that gives lovers of cast
albums the chance to revel in a wholly original American musical.
Brown's is a grown-up score for those of us who want substance with
our razzle-dazzle and our brains engaged as our toes start tapping.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of recently released CD's
 &HT;    By Richard L. Eldgredge, Sonia Murray and Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  ROCK
</P>
<P>
   ``Useful Music''
</P>
<P>
   Josh Joplin Band. SMG. 12 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Poised for national attention with his third release _ and debut
for Shawn Mullins' home-grown label _ Atlanta singer-songwriter
Josh Joplin always has followed a decidedly untrendy muse. His
maturity is sharply evident, whether on the heartbreakingly
beautiful ``Far Away'' or in the wistful childhood memories evoked
by ``Dutch Wonderland.'' Much of the album focuses on failed
relationships, subject matter usually ripe for cliche. ``Useful
Music'' contains not a one. Joplin's melodic songs succeed because
he's able to articulate his confusion and sadness so openly that it
binds him to his audience. And Mullins' clean, spare production
lets those emotions ring more clearly. Jay Leno better make some
more room on his couch. ``Useful Music'' has the potential to put
Joplin there.

<P>
   &QR;  RAP
</P>
<P>
   ``Pimpin' on Wax''
</P>
<P>
   JT Money. Freeworld/Tony Mercedes. 14 tracks. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Look at your watch when you put this album on. And know that at
that hour, minute and second you experienced an Atlanta rapper's
entry into the West Coast territory of ``Pimpin' on Wax'': a debut
as serious as fuzzy dice, loud suits and stacks with fish in the
soles are silly. The former member of bass music's Poison Clan
(``Shake What Your Mama Gave Ya'') continues in the misogynistic
vein of his earlier cohorts. But JT Money takes hip-hop's often
one-dimensional ``pimpin' '' to more intriguing levels. On the No.
1 rap single ``Who Dat?'' Money steps aside and lets the equally
cocky Sole show women have just as much hustle. He steps up his
clear, gruff delivery to match the bounce of ``Watcha Want.'' And
then he steps over to a softer side, proving a poignant lyricist on
the bluesy ``Kite to Ya Boy.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Sonia Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ROCK
</P>
<P>
   ``The Life and Crimes of Alice Cooper'' Alice Cooper. Rhino. 81
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   The only crime this four-CD retrospective is guilty of is
box-set bloat. Few artists deserve to be so extensively
anthologized _ even the work of such durable rockers as Elton John
and Rod Stewart showed wear when stretched to such lengths. Alice
Cooper's career is particularly patchy. Discs three and four, which
chronicle the shock-rock pioneer's limp '80s and '90s output, are
virtually unlistenable. (Though it's a hoot to hear the 1980 Gary
Numan rip-off ``Clones'' again.) And the long-lost tracks that open
the set _ by Cooper's mid-'60s garage rock group, the Spiders _
should have remained lost.
</P>
<P>
   But sandwiched in between is some pretty choice stuff, including
fist-pumping classic rock staples (``School's Out'') and charmingly
theatrical set pieces (``Go to Hell''). Most shocking is how dated
it all sounds. In this age of Marilyn Manson, a necrophiliac anthem
such as ``Cold Ethyl'' is about as chilling as ``The Monster
Mash.''

 &HT;    Slicker Jack Logan remains true to scruffy roots
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If a singer is his songs, then the Jack Logan whom critics and a
healthy cult of fans came to know on his 1994 debut, ``Bulk,'' was
a laid-back dude in grease-stained overalls, with a six-pack of
cold beer within easy reach and a dogeared Flannery O'Connor
paperback in his back pocket. Not slick, but a refreshing reminder
that rowdy, three-chord rock could also aspire to thoughtfully
literate devices. Pop open ``Buzz Me In,'' and it's clear that our
working-class hero has experienced an upgrade: He poses in a dinner
jacket, clutching a bouquet as if greeting a prom date.
</P>
<P>
   It's a giggle, but an apt one. The album, recorded in 1997 and
finally rescued by Capricorn Records from Logan's former label,
applies studio gloss to the Winder songwriter's scruffy craft.
Kosmo Vinyl's production is too fussy at times, yet it does wonders
for Logan's sincere baritone, locking in the emotional grain of his
voice against an ever-shifting backdrop. Between offhanded nods to
the Rolling Stones (``All Grown Up'') and George Jones
(``Melancholy Girl,'' ``Pearl of Them All''), Logan luxuriates in
plush arrangements that buffer his slice-of-life lyrics with airy
vibes, breezy guitar and the stray, muted trumpet. Close inspection
reveals, however, that while the scenarios change, the singer stays
true. ``Your neck smells like peppermint,'' he declares in the
album's most inspired couplet. ``C'mon, baby, let me pay your
rent.''

 &HT;    `Imposters' provides shipload of fun nostalgia
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Impostors'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   The folks who brought us the savory, bittersweet ``Big Night''
go flat-out silly in this homage to shipboard romances of the
1930s. Writer-director Stanley Tucci and Oliver Platt play
out-of-work actors who stow away on a luxury liner populated by
familiar types: the grande dame (Dana Ivey), her sad-sack daughter
(Hope Davis), a fascist ship's steward (Campbell Scott), the
activities director whom he covets (Lili Taylor) and even the
occasional melancholy European royal (Isabella Rossellini).
</P>
<P>
   Tucci and Platt get into various scrapes, parade around in
disguise and stumble upon a terrorist plot.
</P>
<P>
   The pratfalls and chases do wear thin after a while. But the
cast (including an uncredited Woody Allen) is so game and gung-ho,
their enthusiasm becomes contagious. Grade: B

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Cruise'' (PG) _ Get on the bus. Cruising takes on a
whole new meaning in this quirky, low-budget black-and-white
documentary. Timothy ``Speed'' Levitch is a loquaciously eccentric
tour guide for a Manhattan bus company. Levitch is a heck of a
character study; he can get irritating. But surveying his domain
from the top of a double-decker, he's a kind of inspired
performance artist. Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   _ Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Very Bad Things'' (R) _ When a stag party goes murderously
out of control, the groom-to-be and his pals (Jon Favreau, Jeremy
Piven, Daniel Stern and Christian Slater) go to great lengths to
cover their tracks. Even if it means killing a bunch of people, or
each other. This pitch-black comedy from Peter Berg is the sort of
sick-joke experience you'll tend to love or hate. Grade: B -
</P>
<P>
   _ Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Bent'' (R) _ The first third features some twisted fun in
its vision of gay bohemian life in World War II Berlin (that's Mick
Jagger in a dress, folks). But when it gets to the concentration
camps, the movie betrays its stage origins, and actors Clive Owen
and Lothaire Bluteau are competent but not riveting as would-be
lovers who meet behind barbed wire. Grade: B -
</P>
<P>
   _ Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Holy Man'' (PG) _ A mild comedy-drama that wastes Eddie
Murphy's talents as a New Age drifter who brings big sales and
enlightenment to home-shopping producer Jeff Goldblum and media
analyst Kelly Preston; he's their spiritual Lassie, leading them to
warm-fuzzy values. It's Hollywood's latest reduction of spiritual
values to ``give somebody a hug.'' And it's not even very funny.
Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   _ Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``In Dreams'' (R) _ In what could be called ``Nightmare on Elm
Street'' meets ``The Eyes of Laura Mars,'' a psychic woman (Annette
Bening) is harassed in dreams by a child-murdering psycho. For an
hour, the movie is eerie and disturbing, but an overly long
encounter between Bening and the madman proves damaging. Grade: B-

<P>
   BRUSSELS _ A massacre on the road to Prizren, more than 100
civilians _ most of them ethnic Albanians _ torn apart in the
village of Korisa, stories of women and children ripped apart by
NATO cluster bombs.
</P>
<P>
   And how did NATO kick off their its o'clock follies Friday
afternoon? Without a single word about these frightful reports, not
a single bloody word of astonishment or compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Jamie Shea and his Luftwaffe general droned on about
NATO's successful operations over Kosovo. ``They went very well,''
Luftwaffe Major General Walter Jertz informed us. ``It was another
very effective day of operations.''
</P>
<P>
   In Saigon, they had the five o'clock follies. In the 1991 Gulf
War, the Americans boasted of their military successes at the four
o'clock follies. In Brussels, NATO's follies start at three
o'clock.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, the Shea-Jertz show was theatre of the obscene.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as we all waited to hear NATO's reaction to what might
be its most terrible bloodbath to date (or Serbia's most successful
propaganda), a NATO technician projected a massive test slide onto
the screen next to the 19 flags of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say we're young and we don't know _ won't find out until
we grow,'' the words said on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Were these lines from the Sonny and Cher song supposed to be
gallows humor or just monumental ill-taste? The moment Shea and
Jertz walked to the podium, we knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still see no indications of a Serb ground force redeployal
(sic),'' Jertz announced. Forty tons of supplies had reached the
Red Cross at Pristina. ``I can assure you we will do everything
possible to ensure the safe passage of these convoys.''
</P>
<P>
   All of us in the darkened Joseph Luns auditorium at NATO
headquarters were holding our breath. Several journalists (the
television coverage never shows this, of course) shook their heads
in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   There had, it seemed, been no safe passage in Kosovo. We were
thinking of the first reports coming in _ of NATO cluster bombs
bursting amid 500 Albanian refugees, many of them children, of a
massacre that would make even the April Prizren-Djakovica slaughter
small-scale.
</P>
<P>
   We wanted to know about those who were young but would never
grow.
</P>
<P>
   But no, General Jertz of the Luftwaffe _ or the ``German Air
Force'' as we are for some reason encouraged to call it here _
wanted to tell us there had been 679 NATO missions over Yugoslavia
in 24 hours, that there had been attacks on oil refineries,
electricity stations, the Batajnica airfield.
</P>
<P>
   On the slide screen _ incredibly _ were projected the words ``A
GOOD DAY.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Shea launched into his usual denunciations of Serb
atrocities, exhuming some old pictures of alleged mass graves and
some (slightly) newer ones of burned villages.
</P>
<P>
   He quoted from old human-rights and newspaper articles and
managed to mispronounce the names of seven Kosovo villages. ``God
knows, frankly, what we are going to find when Kosovo is open,'' he
said, solemnly shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   God knows, I'm sure, what Shea was thinking; he was far more
frightened of what western journalists _ bussed to the scene by the
Serb authorities _ would find in the village of Korisa.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty tractors had been destroyed in the attack, the Serbs were
reporting, close to an area that had been the scene of sustained
NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
   It was, you see, significant that Shea had not mentioned _ had
not alluded for a second _ to these extraordinary reports. Had he
thought for a moment that the Serbs had slaughtered these people,
he would have told us all he knew. But he was silent.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague muttered in my ear that when Shea was asked about
the reported massacre, he would express no compassion for the dead
but ``promise another of his full and thorough investigations.''
</P>
<P>
   And when at last he was asked, Shea expressed no compassion for
the dead but promised ``a full and thorough investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   He hoped, he added sarcastically, that the journalists bussed to
the village by the Serbs would ``insist on their right to go around
freely and do their own research'' _ Shea is now apparently a
professor of journalism as well as a NATO flak _ and that they
would investigate ``ethnic cleansing'' in the nearby town of
Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know NATO _ we give the truth on these issues, every
single time, the full facts.''
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't. NATO does not give ``the full facts'' (or ``the
full fax'' as Shea keeps saying). It lies.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked for NATO's reaction to the KLA appointment of one
of the most notorious ethnic cleansers as its new military
commander _ Agim Ceku, one of the planners of Croatia's ethnic
cleansing of 300,000 Serbs in Krajina _ Shea said he had no comment
because ``NATO has no direct contact with the KLA.''
</P>
<P>
   This is totally untrue. NATO liaises with the KLA, holds
security and intelligence meetings with their commanders, maintains
radio contact with KLA men in Kosovo. NATO officials (including J.
Shea, Esq.) regularly announce KLA operations with approval. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (150-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And when I asked General Jertz if NATO was using depleted
uranium munitions in Serbia, he said that it had not done so for
two weeks but that depleted uranium is harmless.
</P>
<P>
   This, too, is a lie. There is growing evidence that the dust
from spent depleted uranium shells has caused an explosion of
cancers in southern Iraq and may well be a cause of Gulf War
syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   British weapons testing sights are meticulously washed down
after depleted uranium test-firings, their contents sealed in
concrete. Nothing to worry about, said the general.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find uranium in all sorts of things _ in rocks, soil...''
No harm could be caused by the use of such shells, Shea added. So
much for the deformed babies now being born in Basra.
</P>
<P>
   And so much, I suppose, for the contaminated homes of Kosovo to
which NATO claims it will return all of the Albanian refugees. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I kept wondering what this whole farce reminded me of. Here were
the two NATO men recording, minute after minute, hour after hour,
day after day, the destruction of the Kosovo population _ the fault
of the Serbs, to be sure, but the symbol nonetheless of NATO's
total, abject failure in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, they tell us about mass graves and death and torture.
And I recalled after a while what it all reminded me of _ the
discreet voices, the dipped lights, the flags hanging like dead
flowers behind the podium, even the sinister iron Death Star which
stands grimly outside NATO headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   It reminded me of an undertaker's office. The mock
soul-searching, the old pictures, the expressions of regret. The
cockney and the general were the morticians, as unable to
contemplate an end to NATO's bombardment of Serbia as they were to
arrest old age or find a cure for death.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is dead. Its people are dead or dispossessed. For
investigation, read autopsy. And after a while it dawned on me as
it has dawned on others attending these preposterous gatherings: we
are being prepared for the death of NATO. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT _ In the dirt of the Sabra and Chatila Palestinian
refugee camp and in Mar Elias, they were not celebrating the
election victory of Israeli Ehud Barak Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Over the entrance to Mar Elias camp, with its open sewers and
old, worn water pipes running down the pavement, there hung an iron
map of Palestine: the original Palestine, Haifa as well as
Ramallah, Tel Aviv as well as Nablus, Jerusalem as well as Jericho,
the whole shebang. And they are not going to get it back.
</P>
<P>
   They would like _ the Palestinians who live among the garbage
here _ to have the same ``right of return'' that U.S. President
Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair have promised to
the Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton and Blair did not intend their promise to apply to
the Palestinians from Haifa and the rest of that part of Palestine
that became Israel in 1948 (nor do they want them to return there).
</P>
<P>
   And when you enter the grotty concrete hovel where Suheil Natour
holds forth, you can see how enormous is the chasm that divides CNN
from reality, which separates ``peace hopes'' from peace _ which
makes Ehud Barak's election a mere footnote to catastrophe for the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The differences between the Likud and Labor are minor,'' the
spokesman for the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor wants the annexation of 52 percent of the West Bank,
Likud wanted 64 percent _ this is the difference for the
Palestinians.'' Which, for the dispossessed, for the 4 million
Palestinians of the diaspora, is all that matters.
</P>
<P>
   True, Barak wants peace. But everyone wants peace; the
Palestinians and the Israelis. Yet Barak has said that he will not
cede the Arab quarter of Jerusalem to Palestine. So what hope for
Palestine?
</P>
<P>
   It may be peace of a kind that the electorate of Israel has
voted for. But it is not peace in our time.
</P>
<P>
   The Arab world _ the supine, humiliated Arab dictatorships whose
leaders have pleaded for Washington's love and support and money _
welcomed the Labor leader's victory in the Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
   Out came Egypt's familiar ``hand of peace'' (and oh, if only
President Hosni Mubarak would hold the same kind of free elections
which Israel conducts).
</P>
<P>
   ``Egypt is ready to cooperate with the new Israeli prime
minister to revive the peace process and to change the general
atmosphere in the region which was extremely poisoned over the last
three years,'' the Egyptian foreign minister, Amr Moussa, said.
</P>
<P>
   And from Jordan _ whose Plucky Little King II has prayed for
Benjamin Netanyahu's defeat _ came equally familiar words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully,'' the deputy prime minister, Ayman Majali said,
``we will witness a serious move on the peace process, on the
Palestinian-Israeli track and on the Syrian-Israeli and Lebanese
tracks and hopefully we will witness a serious move for a
comprehensive, just and durable peace in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   But note the double ``hopefully'' and the reference to a
``just'' peace. And the use of the American phrase ``tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Israelis have been trying to divide the Arabs
into these different tracks. The Palestinians fear Barak will do
just the same.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Yasser Arafat joined in the applause. ``I respect the
choice of this democratic election,'' he said without missing a
heartbeat when he used the word ``democratic'' _ that quality which
Arafat's Palestine so miserably lacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give my best wishes to Barak,'' Arafat chimed.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gulf, many a sheikh will be breathing a similar sigh of
relief. Now that the awful Netanyahu has gone, they can deal with
the nice Barak. Just like that.
</P>
<P>
   But history _ especially Palestinian history _ does not work
like that. If there is to be a Palestinian state _ the only hope
for a real peace _ then the Palestinians will have to have a
capital in part of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   They will have to see an end to occupation, an end to the theft
of Arab land and the continued building of Jewish settlements on
Arab land, an end to the confiscation of Palestinian identity
papers, an end to the demolition of Arab homes.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has promised none of this. Indeed, he may be more
interested in making a peace overture to Syria and Lebanon rather
than Palestine, in leaving Arafat to suffocate for awhile longer in
his Gaza dunghill as the Palestinian leader's popularity sinks even
lower.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? Syria still demands, consistently, the return of
the occupied Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   President Hafez Assad had held out (in Syria's negotiations with
the Rabin-Peres Labor government) for a withdrawal of Israeli
troops to the borders of June 4, 1967, a frontier which would give
Damascus that part of Golan which Arafat considers Palestine, the
bit which is the source of water _ the Middle East's gold.
</P>
<P>
   Rabin refused. Barak may accept. So goodbye, Arafat would
conclude, to another bit of Palestine. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (350-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, a peace with Syria would allow Israel to withdraw
from the cauldron of Lebanon _ ``unconditionally,'' according to
U.N. Security Council Resolution 425, though Barak may have other
ideas _ and save its soldiers from the increasing attacks of
Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has promised to be out of Lebanon in a year. But on the
ground, where it always matters in the Middle East, things do not
seem that easy.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday (don't look for the news reports because it went
unmentioned) Israeli shellfire killed two civilians in the Lebanese
town of Nabatea. The Hezbollah retaliated with Katyusha rockets
into Galilee (wounding Israeli civilians, which did not go
unreported).
</P>
<P>
   And this week the Lebanese resistance movement displayed in
Beirut an entire armored personnel carrier _ captured from Israel's
surrogate ``South Lebanon Army'' militia in southern Lebanon over
the weekend.

<P>
   What's more, the Middle East has changed since Benjamin
Netanyahu came to power in Israel three years ago. President
Mohamed Khatami of Iran _ elected democratically with a far more
devastating popular vote than Barak _ has been meeting King Fahd of
Saudi Arabia after visiting President Assad in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   For Iran is no longer the pariah of the region, feared by those
Gulf Arabs who so eagerly invited American troops to their
peninsula when Iraqi president Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and
became the greatest threat to the region since the last greatest
threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranians are now talking of a ``strong regional alliance''
between Tehran and the Arab Gulf. And they have reason to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The Arab kings and emirs are tired of America's crusade against
Iraq and its sanctions-cull of Iraqi children.
</P>
<P>
   They are weary of Washington's vacillation in the face of
Israel's refusal to abide by the American ``peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   They are distrustful of an America which demands obedience to
U.N. resolutions from Arabs but none from Israel.
</P>
<P>
   If Washington hated Netanyahu but allowed him to get away with
building more settlements, what will it not permit Barak to do? &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Back, then, to that hovel in the Mar Elias refugee camp Tuesday.
``The Labor government did not block settlements _ it went on
building them,'' Natour said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a genius for prolonging the ``peace process,'' to
create new settlements, to ``Judaicize'' Jerusalem, to create facts
on the ground. The Israelis like to play on differences of interest
between the Arabs.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Lebanese press took Natour's view, warning readers
that the difference between Labor and Likud is not that great.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wings of angels will not sprout on the shoulders of
Barak,'' the daily ``An Nahar'' warned. ``Claws already decorate
the fingers of Barak.''
</P>
<P>
   Pessimism, of course, comes as easily to the Arabs as optimism
comes to the Israelis. But it's going to be a long haul.
</P>
<P>
   For the Middle East _ and for America _ Barak is better than
Netanyahu. But it is not peace in our time. &QL;

 By ROBERT FISK  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT _ In the dirt of the Sabra and Chatila Palestinian
refugee camp and in Mar Elias, they were not celebrating the
election victory of Israeli Ehud Barak Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Over the entrance to Mar Elias camp, with its open sewers and
old, worn water pipes running down the pavement, there hung an iron
map of Palestine: the original Palestine, Haifa as well as
Ramallah, Tel Aviv as well as Nablus, Jerusalem as well as Jericho,
the whole shebang. And they are not going to get it back.
</P>
<P>
   They would like _ the Palestinians who live among the garbage
here _ to have the same ``right of return'' that U.S. President
Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair have promised to
the Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton and Blair did not intend their promise to apply to
the Palestinians from Haifa and the rest of that part of Palestine
that became Israel in 1948 (nor do they want them to return there).
</P>
<P>
   And when you enter the grotty concrete hovel where Suheil Natour
holds forth, you can see how enormous is the chasm that divides CNN
from reality, which separates ``peace hopes'' from peace _ which
makes Ehud Barak's election a mere footnote to catastrophe for the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The differences between the Likud and Labor are minor,'' the
spokesman for the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor wants the annexation of 52 percent of the West Bank,
Likud wanted 64 percent _ this is the difference for the
Palestinians.'' Which, for the dispossessed, for the 4 million
Palestinians of the diaspora, is all that matters.
</P>
<P>
   True, Barak wants peace. But everyone wants peace; the
Palestinians and the Israelis. Yet Barak has said that he will not
cede the Arab quarter of Jerusalem to Palestine. So what hope for
Palestine?
</P>
<P>
   It may be peace of a kind that the electorate of Israel has
voted for. But it is not peace in our time.
</P>
<P>
   The Arab world _ the supine, humiliated Arab dictatorships whose
leaders have pleaded for Washington's love and support and money _
welcomed the Labor leader's victory in the Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
   Out came Egypt's familiar ``hand of peace'' (and oh, if only
President Hosni Mubarak would hold the same kind of free elections
which Israel conducts).
</P>
<P>
   ``Egypt is ready to cooperate with the new Israeli prime
minister to revive the peace process and to change the general
atmosphere in the region which was extremely poisoned over the last
three years,'' the Egyptian foreign minister, Amr Moussa, said.
</P>
<P>
   And from Jordan _ whose Plucky Little King II has prayed for
Benjamin Netanyahu's defeat _ came equally familiar words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully,'' the deputy prime minister, Ayman Majali said,
``we will witness a serious move on the peace process, on the
Palestinian-Israeli track and on the Syrian-Israeli and Lebanese
tracks and hopefully we will witness a serious move for a
comprehensive, just and durable peace in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   But note the double ``hopefully'' and the reference to a
``just'' peace. And the use of the American phrase ``tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Israelis have been trying to divide the Arabs
into these different tracks. The Palestinians fear Barak will do
just the same.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Yasser Arafat joined in the applause. ``I respect the
choice of this democratic election,'' he said without missing a
heartbeat when he used the word ``democratic'' _ that quality which
Arafat's Palestine so miserably lacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give my best wishes to Barak,'' Arafat chimed.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gulf, many a sheikh will be breathing a similar sigh of
relief. Now that the awful Netanyahu has gone, they can deal with
the nice Barak. Just like that.
</P>
<P>
   But history _ especially Palestinian history _ does not work
like that. If there is to be a Palestinian state _ the only hope
for a real peace _ then the Palestinians will have to have a
capital in part of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   They will have to see an end to occupation, an end to the theft
of Arab land and the continued building of Jewish settlements on
Arab land, an end to the confiscation of Palestinian identity
papers, an end to the demolition of Arab homes.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has promised none of this. Indeed, he may be more
interested in making a peace overture to Syria and Lebanon rather
than Palestine, in leaving Arafat to suffocate for awhile longer in
his Gaza dunghill as the Palestinian leader's popularity sinks even
lower.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? Syria still demands, consistently, the return of
the occupied Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   President Hafez Assad had held out (in Syria's negotiations with
the Rabin-Peres Labor government) for a withdrawal of Israeli
troops to the borders of June 4, 1967, a frontier which would give
Damascus that part of Golan which Arafat considers Palestine, the
bit which is the source of water _ the Middle East's gold.
</P>
<P>
   Rabin refused. Barak may accept. So goodbye, Arafat would
conclude, to another bit of Palestine. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (350-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, a peace with Syria would allow Israel to withdraw
from the cauldron of Lebanon _ ``unconditionally,'' according to
U.N. Security Council Resolution 425, though Barak may have other
ideas _ and save its soldiers from the increasing attacks of
Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has promised to be out of Lebanon in a year. But on the
ground, where it always matters in the Middle East, things do not
seem that easy.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday (don't look for the news reports because it went
unmentioned) Israeli shellfire killed two civilians in the Lebanese
town of Nabatea. The Hezbollah retaliated with Katyusha rockets
into Galilee (wounding Israeli civilians, which did not go
unreported).
</P>
<P>
   And this week the Lebanese resistance movement displayed in
Beirut an entire armored personnel carrier _ captured from Israel's
surrogate ``South Lebanon Army'' militia in southern Lebanon over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the Middle East has changed since Benjamin
Netanyahu came to power in Israel three years ago. President

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON AND WASHINGTON _ As Israel was adjusting Tuesday to Ehud
Barak's sweeping electoral triumph over Benjamin Netanyahu, it
emerged that close aides to Tony Blair and Bill Clinton had been
working closely with Barak's Labor Party and transforming it in the
way Blair modernized Britain's New Labor.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Gould, the British Prime Minister's opinion polling guru,
and Stan Greenberg, who does the same job for President Clinton,
have held monthly strategy meetings in Israel for the past two
years with Barak, the newly-elected Israeli prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Confidential documents seen by The Independent reveal the extent
of their work in helping the Israeli Labor Party back to power.
</P>
<P>
   Barak even came to London for a two-day brainstorming session on
how to remodel his image.
</P>
<P>
   The White House Tuesday hailed the election of Barak with
restrained delight but was closer to the election campaign than its
public neutrality suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Greenberg, advising Barak in his planning strategy,
conducting polls and framing advertising, were two other members of
the election team credited with helping Clinton to his first
presidential victory in 1992: James Carville and Robert Shrum.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of a new advance in the Middle East is
especially welcome in Washington, where Clinton is in sore need of
a foreign policy success following the diplomatic setbacks in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of his military service, the question of General
Barak's devotion to the security of Israel is not in question,''
Clinton told reporters Tuesday after a meeting with King Abdullah
of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The direct involvement of Blair and Clinton aides followed an
appeal for help by Daniel Levy, the Tel Aviv-based son of Lord
(Michael) Levy, a close friend and the tennis partner of Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Gould and Greenberg were the architects of the proposal that the
party change its name, even suggesting at one point that it be
called New Labor.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the Labor party kept its name but fought the
election under the One Israel banner, the name of the alliance it
formed with two smaller parties.
</P>
<P>
   How far the new model Labor party made more than a cosmetic
difference to the outcome of the election is doubted by some
Israeli analysts. Barak won, they believe, because so many of the
former prime minister's senior colleagues had been fired or
deserted and set up the Center Party to remove him.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign strategy amounted to keeping his mouth shut and
watching his opponent who presided over a rickety coalition,
self-destruct.
</P>
<P>
   But when they became involved in 1997, Gould and Greenberg
warned that the modernization of Labor was the most important and
difficult task facing the Barak campaign. They recommended the
``dramatic high risk'' strategy pursued by Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Their initial assessment of Labor's prospects was poor. Labor's
combination of ``elitism plus softness on the core security
issues'' was summed up as ``fatal.''
</P>
<P>
   A center-left party must do two things, they advised: ``It must
be the party of the people. This means the party of the new middle
class; the new majority; hard-working; tough-minded. It must win
the center: on security; on crime; on welfare it has to be tough,
not soft.''
</P>
<P>
   Gould and Greenberg warned that Labor was not considered to be
``the party of the people''; the party that could best resolve
social problems or unite the country. Neither was it the ``party of
security or religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Gould and Greenberg described Barak's strengths as ``a powerful
and imposing presence; a manifest sense of destiny; the genesis of
a talented team and the innate weakness of Netanyahu, a poor prime
minister tainted by corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Last night Gould said most of the credit should go to Greenberg,
a partner in his London-based political consultancy. ``Stan did an
extraordinary job. He kept faith during a difficult project and got
an incredible result,'' said Gould.
</P>
<P>
   Carville meanwhile _ who was one of Clinton's most bullish
defenders during the Monica Lewinsky affair _ has said in the past
that he accepted the job with Barak in his capacity as a private
consultant and had not asked the White House for approval.
</P>
<P>
   However, he made no secret of the fact that he regularly briefed
Clinton on the progress of the campaign _ briefings that will
doubtless smooth the path of U.S.-Israeli cooperation now.
</P>
<P>
   Among American Jews _ several thousand of whom had taken charter
flights to Israel to cast their vote _ reactions to Barak's victory
reflected the polarization of opinion over Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Given the size of his victory, however, the majority were
expected to rally around Barak, reinforcing calls for peace and
increasing the pressure to establish a durable peace. &QL;

 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair started this war as
the European leader who combined impeccably pro-European
credentials with a stiffening twist of Atlanticism.
</P>
<P>
   To Americans, he appeared as the perfected version of the flawed
Clinton model: an invigorating, center-left politician who didn't
need to lie about his sex life.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, he was the example of revitalized centrism on whom
Gerhard Schroder modelled himself in his bid for the
chancellorship.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's ideas and style were a universally sought-after British
export.
</P>
<P>
   How different things look today in the pre-terminal phase of the
conflict in Kosovo. The Prime Minister is finding himself stuck in
the position that comes least naturally to one of nature's
bridge-builders _ out on a limb.
</P>
<P>
   Germany is panting for an exit strategy from the conflict, at
practically any price. The Chancellor who said a month ago that
Germans should not rule out ground troops because to do so was to
neglect the country's special responsibility for peace in the
Balkans, is now flatly declaring the option ``unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   The French political establishment and opinion polls remain
hawkish, but the military, observing the raison d'etat that led it
into semi-estrangement from NATO four decades ago, is enthusiastic
only about being part of a ground force in which they, rather than
the Americans, provide the lead, take the glory and establish
themselves as the diplomatic force majeure in the region.
</P>
<P>
   As his European support flakes away, Blair has resorted to
pursuing a zigzag policy with the Americans in the hope that he can
needle or wheedle them into some kind of action consistent with
NATO's rhetorical stand against the Serbs' oppression of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days he has alternated praise with criticism in
the hope that this will have some effect on the policymakers in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Having allowed dissatisfaction with American hemming and hawing
on ground troops to leak out at the weekend, Blair has changed tack
on his visit to Albania and lauded the ``vision and steadfastness''
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Prime Minister has recruited the weapon of heavy
irony to his rhetorical arsenal. Vision and steadfastness are the
two qualities most strikingly absent from American policy towards
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In what may prove to be a final throw for ground intervention,
British Foreign Minister Robin Cook will venture to Washington
armed with the British assessment of the Yugoslav National Army's
fighting strength, which shows the Serbs to be far weaker than the
Pentagon's analysis suggests and the environment as ``permissive''
for NATO troops as it could be without Milosevic issuing a
gilt-edged invitation.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning of their association, before Blair's
election, Clinton and Blair sought to appear as a political item.
</P>
<P>
   The Third Way was their love child _ a concept at once so
perfectly inclusive, economically neutral and innocently vacuous
that to oppose it seemed to be an act of bloody-mindedness.
</P>
<P>
   My complaint against the Third Way is that it fudged the
inevitability of making stark choices. War is the starkest choice
of all. Blair realizes that. Clinton does not. As a result, we have
a disquieting loss of resolve at the heart of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The special relationship between Britain and America will not
survive a shabby end to the intervention in Kosovo. Neither, in its
present form, will NATO. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (350-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 550) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In tragic circumstances, Blair has been confronted by the
shortcomings of his political blood brother. New Labor has long had
a blind spot about Clinton's moral vacuum. They considered Monica
Lewinsky and the rest to be the minor lapses of a president who was
otherwise in great ethical shape.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, they betokened a deeper weakness _ his talent for
vacillation and relativism, which has returned to haunt us all in
the conflict with Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Blair, Clinton cannot see a line without fudging it. He
wanted a war without risk, intervention without setting American
foot in the war zone, compassion without cost.
</P>
<P>
   The more fervent Clinton's verbal commitment to help, the less
American resolve has held. When Hillary Rodham Clinton told the
Kosovar refugees last week that she felt their pain, I knew we
really were in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   America aimed to win the war by fluke. When this hope foundered
as Milosevic defied the bombs, Clinton ditched his original goal
and began to seek an exit from war, using the Russians as brokers.
</P>
<P>
   You may remember the scene near the end of ``Schindler's List''
when the Germans have fled the camp and the refugees, still too
numb from their ordeal to feel the joy of liberation, are lying in
a field.
</P>
<P>
   Along comes a uniformed figure on horseback. ``You have been
liberated by the Red Army,'' says the Soviet officer. Such is the
narrative power of Spielberg's film and his cinematography that the
terrible bathos of this moment goes largely unnoticed by audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Liberation by the Russians has always been a mixed blessing, as
those who experienced it in eastern Germany and Poland at the end
of the Second World War still recall.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovars will not return to a part of their territory under
Russian protection. That means partitioning, or, as the Russians
now put it, with nostalgia for their post-1945 role in Germany,
``sectorization.'' There is even talk of a force without a U.S.
component, a triumph for Milosevic. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The closing lines of Robert Southey's poem, ``The Battle of
Blenheim,'' spring to mind, In them, a small boy quizzes his
grandfather over the fate of the doomed 600 cavalrymen: ``What good
came of it at last?'' quoth little Peterkin, ``Ah, that I cannot
tell,'' said he, ``But t'was a famous victory.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, we are watching NATO alliance being destroyed by its
creators, the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Some will welcome this as freedom from Washington's hegemony in
world affairs. Others see it as the great opportunity for Europe to
develop a common military strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we have no other choice. But let us not deceive
ourselves that this is going to happen easily, quickly or reliably.
</P>
<P>
   The continent that cannot agree on how to reform a Common
Agricultural Policy lacks the common will and shared resolve, let
alone the experience, to uphold a peaceful order through thick and
thin.
</P>
<P>
   At the new millennium, we are in a far more exposed and volatile
position in Europe than we have yet begun to comprehend.
</P>
<P>
   Victory will be announced in the Balkans, whatever the outcome.
The Democrats have an election to fight in 18 months' time. The
American people will be told that they did their best to help some
beleaguered people far away.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no such thing as a victimless military failure.
Blair feels this keenly, as any good European must.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Washington can be persuaded that the shame of a bad
compromise will return to haunt it, ``ethnic cleansing'' will again
have been rewarded, and evil gone unpunished. That would be a
famous victory, all right. No good can come of it. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Like police officers moving spectators away from a
nasty accident, spin-doctors and officials in both Britain and the
U.S. were shooing reporters away from the idea of a transatlantic
split Monday _ ``Nothing to see here; move along.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the ringing endorsements of NATO solidarity Monday from
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Foreign Minister Robin Cook
cannot hide a growing and disturbing fact: Washington and London
risk putting themselves on a collision course over the question of
sending infantry into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The squabble could end up making life all the worse for hundreds
of thousands of refugees still at the mercy of the Serbs inside
Kosovo and being used as human shields as Nato steps up its bombing
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The spat is all the more surprising because of the hitherto very
close ties between Downing Street and the White House, celebrated
in daily telephone calls, policy seminars and familial closeness
between ``Tony'' and ``Bill.'' But no amount of ``Third Way
weekends'' can hide the differences.
</P>
<P>
   Neither London nor Washington wants a full-scale invasion, and
neither wants to end the air war. But some officials in Britain
believe that threatening to push harder on the ground would make it
possible to ease up in the air and reduce the civilian casualties
that are mounting daily.
</P>
<P>
   America does not. Britain wants to accelerate planning. America
does not.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it a row over substance, officials on both sides
underline, but presentation - so far. Yet as a consequence of its
persistence and moral fervor, Britain is in danger of creating a
serious argument.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of some in Washington, Britain has repeatedly tried
to steer the United States towards a more aggressive land strategy
for the war.
</P>
<P>
   America will not allow its forces to be put in Kosovo except as
part of a peacekeeping force, or be railroaded into making
commitments until it is ready.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreement goes back to Blair's evening visit to the White
House before the NATO summit last month, when he and his weary
officials clustered into the Oval Office to put their case after a
transatlantic flight.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton deferred repeatedly to Sandy Berger, his hard-nosed
National Security Adviser, and Berger would not budge.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is agreed that if and when a deal is signed with
Belgrade, ground forces _ under NATO command, but with a United
Nations cover _ would enter Kosovo and return the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   More troops would be needed than originally thought _ perhaps
50-60,000, with perhaps 10-15,000 of them Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Planning for this force is under way. But Britain is pushing for
early decisions, before there is a deal, and before it is clear
under what conditions a force would enter Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between Washington and London is one of tone,
strategy and motivation. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   There is broad support for the war in Britain, so Blair and Cook
can afford to be more bellicose. They also seem to believe that
pushing Belgrade harder _ by hinting at a willingness to put in
infantry _ will cut short the air war. And they see the war as a
moral issue.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. believes that the bombing, now up to 700 sorties a day,
is working; that it will press Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic
to a deal in the next few weeks; and that raising any alternatives
will confuse the diplomacy, split NATO and undermine domestic
support for the campaign. &QL;

   U.S. policy has emerged from three competing interests, and it
attempts to balance them all. First, there is the strong moral case
for intervention put by Madeleine Albright, Clinton's secretary of
state and herself a refugee from genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Second, there are the pragmatic arguments of White House staff
against a ground war, and to limit the possibility of U.S.
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Third, there is the military case against a ground war but in
favor of aggressive air strikes _ as aggressive as possible. This
is the strategy pursued by General Wesley Clark, NATO's Supreme
Commander in Europe. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   It is not just still-raw memories of Vietnam or political
cowardice that militates against the aggressive use of ground
forces to win the war.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is not keen, for a start: the army generals do not
believe that invasion would work, except with massive force in an
operation that is almost impossible to imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatically, Washington knows that at least three NATO
governments would probably collapse if it tried to push the war on
in this way. It has already antagonized Moscow almost beyond the
point of no return.
</P>
<P>
   Militarily, the ghost of Bosnia still stalks the corridors in
Washington and London.
</P>
<P>
   Then, America pushed for air strikes while the Conservatives put
British forces on the ground as part of a U.N. force. As far as the
Americans are concerned, that proved ground forces could simply
become hostages to fortune.
</P>
<P>
   There is no constituency in Washington for a land war, or even
the aggressive use of U.S. forces on the ground. Most Americans
would no more willingly see their sons die in Kosovo than Britons
would allow theirs to die in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is irretrievably split, unable in recent votes to back
the current strategy, escalation or an end to the war. It will be a
hard fight for Clinton to get permission from Congress even for a
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   Americans do not necessarily see Blair's crusade as a heroic
struggle for good. Many think he is arguing for Americans to be
killed in a war that is not theirs. Unlike Blair, Clinton has to
listen to the opposition: they control the purse strings and the
right to declare war.
</P>
<P>
   Sending Cook to Washington is an opportunity to ease the
disagreements. The long-planned trip will be used to present a
united face as often as possible, and efforts were under way to
arrange joint appearances with Ms. Albright to show there is no
divide.
</P>
<P>
   There are key decisions to be made in the next month, leading up
to the crucial G8 summit of the West and Russia on June 18-20. &QL;

<P>
   NATO has started planning for the peacekeeping force in Kosovo,
and commitments will soon be needed from the U.S. for a new and
larger force. Britain wants a substantial U.S. presence, but there
is a strong argument in the U.S. that the force should be largely
European.
</P>
<P>
   There are also discussions on how to handle Kosovo's political
future. There is an emerging view in Washington that Milosevic must
be given some latitude to help him to back down; and there is a
continuing view in the White House that ultimately, only he can do
the deal that will end the war.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has sometimes seemed to lean more in the direction of
removing Milosevic. If the current row is not rapidly smoothed
over, it risks making these differences all the harder to bridge. &QL;

<P>
   Second, there are the pragmatic arguments of White House staff
against a ground war, and to limit the possibility of U.S.
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Third, there is the military case against a ground war but in
favor of aggressive air strikes _ as aggressive as possible. This
is the strategy pursued by General Wesley Clark, NATO's Supreme
Commander in Europe. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is not just still-raw memories of Vietnam or political
cowardice that militates against the aggressive use of ground
forces to win the war.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is not keen, for a start: the army generals do not
believe that invasion would work, except with massive force in an
operation that is almost impossible to imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatically, Washington knows that at least three NATO
governments would probably collapse if it tried to push the war on
in this way. It has already antagonized Moscow almost beyond the
point of no return.
</P>
<P>
   Militarily, the ghost of Bosnia still stalks the corridors in
Washington and London.
</P>
<P>
   Then, America pushed for air strikes while the Conservatives put
British forces on the ground as part of a U.N. force. As far as the
Americans are concerned, that proved ground forces could simply
become hostages to fortune.
</P>
<P>
   There is no constituency in Washington for a land war, or even
the aggressive use of U.S. forces on the ground. Most Americans
would no more willingly see their sons die in Kosovo than Britons
would allow theirs to die in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is irretrievably split, unable in recent votes to back
the current strategy, escalation or an end to the war. It will be a
hard fight for Clinton to get permission from Congress even for a
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   Americans do not necessarily see Blair's crusade as a heroic
struggle for good. Many think he is arguing for Americans to be
killed in a war that is not theirs. Unlike Blair, Clinton has to
listen to the opposition: they control the purse strings and the
right to declare war.
</P>
<P>
   Sending Cook to Washington is an opportunity to ease the
disagreements. The long-planned trip will be used to present a
united face as often as possible, and efforts were under way to
arrange joint appearances with Ms. Albright to show there is no
divide.
</P>
<P>
   There are key decisions to be made in the next month, leading up
to the crucial G8 summit of the West and Russia on June 18-20. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,075. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   NATO has started planning for the peacekeeping force in Kosovo,
and commitments will soon be needed from the U.S. for a new and
larger force. Britain wants a substantial U.S. presence, but there
is a strong argument in the U.S. that the force should be largely
European.
</P>
<P>
   There are also discussions on how to handle Kosovo's political
future. There is an emerging view in Washington that Milosevic must
be given some latitude to help him to back down; and there is a
continuing view in the White House that ultimately, only he can do
the deal that will end the war.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has sometimes seemed to lean more in the direction of
removing Milosevic. If the current row is not rapidly smoothed
over, it risks making these differences all the harder to bridge. &QL;

   TEL AVIV _ The crushing fall of Benjamin Netanyahu tells an
amazing Israeli story of a bright man who changed the rules of the
local political game, and became his own victim.
</P>
<P>
   It was not his policies, though they did set Israel back, that
brought about his resonant, pathetic defeat. It was his character.
</P>
<P>
   A child when Israel was born, I have never witnessed an election
campaign here in which the main issue was the incumbent leader's
personality. And for good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu was, as The Economist once dubbed him, a serial
bungler, an erratic leader for a nation in urgent need for an
orderly agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The popular slogan, referring to his nickname _ ``Just Not
Bibi'' _ ended the three-year dominance of a flawed politician over
the Israeli scene. This abysmal failure to make good on a vaulting
ambition gave his short career almost Shakespearean dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Netanyahu's self-destructive psyche, the election was
about Israel's political culture.
</P>
<P>
   In as much as they are surprisingly conservative, and still
gripped by tribal allegiances, the majority of Israelis felt they
had had enough.
</P>
<P>
   Enough of the cunning play on their angst over Arab threats.
Enough of their leader's unbearable propensity to alienate almost
all his colleagues and most of Israel's friends in the world, while
engaging his opponents with heated hate rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Opposite Netanyahu, in a meticulous Tony Blair-like campaign,
Ehud Barak smartly grasped the popular urge for reconciliation,
stability and basic common sense.
</P>
<P>
   At times, as his understated tone made some of his TV
appearances seem a disaster, his supporters despaired. But as
Netanyahu was intensifying his populist, distorted attacks on the
``leftist'' elites and on the media, he isolated himself in an
increasingly paranoid campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bibi became a burden. Barak gained momentum. He now enjoys a
rare parliamentary leeway in a political system used to choking
near-ties.
</P>
<P>
   His victory is actually a revival of the late Yitzhak Rabin's
era, which was tragically cut short in the midst of major political
and economic achievements. Barak will now have to renew that
national agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In a vague campaign of soundbites, steered by a host of American
consultants, there was, for example, hardly a mention of the
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations stopped by Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Barak remained opaque on whether his wish for a wide power base
might evolve into an embrace of the religious parties _ and a
cohabitation with the Likud party that poisoned the politics of the
1980s. This will be the stuff of criticism soon awaiting the prime
minister designate.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, hope is rampant. Never have so many enthusiastic
Israelis thronged in the squares to celebrate on election night, as
if it were Independence Day. They also signaled their expectation
of a new leader who would cut a new national deal. &QL;

<P>
   PARIS _ As bombs rain down on ``strategic'' targets while
Serbian forces empty Kosovo, public opinion in Britain, France and
the United States largely approves NATO's ``air campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many of those polled feel that a ``ground
campaign'' will eventually be required. Most defense experts in the
three countries mirror those conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Kosovo has a vocabulary problem. The terms ``air''
and ``ground'' seem to offer a classic choice of military options.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they offer incomplete choices, fail to reflect accepted
U.S. or NATO military concepts, and thus blur _ perhaps fatally _
the search for a military solution of NATO's current dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   The saying that hope is not a method expresses that dilemma. A
single-dimension strategy based on the use of force to ``signal''
and ``punish,'' instead of decisive force used in all dimensions to
compel, leaves only the hope that all will come out right.
</P>
<P>
   There is a better choice. The campaign which offers the surest,
and in the long run a less costly, way to accomplish the alliance's
political goals _ surer than the hope-to-win choice of an air-only
effort, and leaner than a ``ground campaign's'' hundreds of
thousands of troops _ is the one already embodied in the
war-fighting doctrine of NATO and the U.S. armed forces: a truly
joint campaign in all dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   In the joint U.S. and NATO military doctrine published after the
Gulf War, the term ``air campaign'' was deliberately never used.
</P>
<P>
   The Gulf War had made clear two things about air power. First,
air power has so immensely matured as a military tool that air
interdiction is now conceptually the equal of land and sea maneuver
_ something that soldiers and sailors do not like to admit.
</P>
<P>
   But second, the use of air power, although essential to success
in modern warfare, is not alone sufficient to ensure such success.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of problems associated with ground campaigns as
well, problems which have kept that option off the table so far in
this war.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of significant numbers of casualties and extremely
difficult terrain, as well as completely inadequate ports and
infrastructure for large land forces, give pause to all but the
most fervent advocates of a land solution.
</P>
<P>
   But it is precisely the shortcomings of single-dimensional
solutions that a truly joint campaign is designed to avoid. The
superb functioning and capabilities of allied air power, and the
enabling power of allied naval forces, makes adding land combat
power to the equation much less costly and much more effective.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the military aim focused primarily on the occupation of
Kosovo and the repatriation of refugees makes the operation more
achievable.
</P>
<P>
   This also makes an extensive Serbian guerrilla movement less
likely, since there are relatively few Serbian civilians in the
province to nurture a guerrilla resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Given that aim, NATO can leverage its overwhelming power to
protect the introduction of land forces, using all the tools
available: light infantry, armored, motorized, airborne, airmobile
and special forces, plus operational maneuver from the sea.
</P>
<P>
   That mix of forces, relying on massive air and naval power,
means substantially smaller land forces.
</P>
<P>
   Once introduced, the simple existence of land combat power (if
only in Albania, where it should have been deployed before the
first bomb was dropped) should force the Serbs to abandon some of
their passive defense measures such as spreading out their tanks in
ones and twos.
</P>
<P>
   As the concepts that are supposed to guide future U.S. military
operations stress, synchronized land maneuver and air interdiction
create an agonizing dilemma for opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Concentrating will brutally expose Serbian forces to heavier
losses from interdiction. But if they stay hunkered down, their
passive measures to reduce losses to interdiction mean they cannot
effectively counter allied surface maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   Single-dimensional operations are not the way it's supposed to
be done in the post-Gulf War era. It is not too late to start using
all the tools in NATO's bag. &QL;

   Once introduced, the simple existence of land combat power (if
only in Albania, where it should have been deployed before the
first bomb was dropped) should force the Serbs to abandon some of
their passive defense measures such as spreading out their tanks in
ones and twos.
</P>
<P>
   As the concepts that are supposed to guide future U.S. military
operations stress, synchronized land maneuver and air interdiction
create an agonizing dilemma for opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Concentrating will brutally expose Serbian forces to heavier
losses from interdiction. But if they stay hunkered down, their
passive measures to reduce losses to interdiction mean they cannot
effectively counter allied surface maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   Single-dimensional operations are not the way it's supposed to
be done in the post-Gulf War era. It is not too late to start using
all the tools in NATO's bag. &QL;

MALCOLM X FAMILY READY TO SUE TO STOP DIARY SALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The family of Malcolm X is poised to sue to stop
the sale of the slain civil rights leader's diary by the
Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield auction house here on May 27.
</P>
<P>
   New York attorney Joseph Fleming, representing the heirs of
Malcolm X and his late wife Betty Shabazz, said Tuesday that his
inquiries so far indicate the diary was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   The red 146-page diary, worth an estimated $30,000 to $50,000,
was found in the left breast pocket of the suit that the
charismatic leader was wearing when he was assassinated Feb. 21,
1965, in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield received the book from a private
collector with whom it has often done business in the past, who in
turn bought it from a person who allegedly saved it from
destruction in the New York archives.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming said the only way the diary could have found its way
into private hands other than by theft is if the file on the
Malcolm X case were purged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our understanding is that if there was a purging of the file
that all of it would have been purged, not any one or two items,''
Fleming said. ``There's no indication of any such purging or
disposition of the diary.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City archivist Kenneth Cobb said his office received
the Malcolm X file _ presumably including evidentiary material
introduced at the trial of his assassins _ in 1993 and hasn't
removed anything from it. ``Once it comes into the archives, it's
never purged,'' Cobb said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City district attorney's office, which had the file
for 25 years, has no information on how the diary got to the
auction block.
</P>
<P>
   ``The file has been out of our office for many years,'' said
spokesman Wayne Bryson, adding he did not know whether the diary
had ever been in the district attorney's possession.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming challenged Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield's assumption that
it received the document through legitimate channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are on notice that there is a clear indication that this
item was stolen. No matter how it got to Butterfield, it was
stolen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't resolve this in the next day or two, we will have
to go to court in California to enjoin the sale,'' Fleming said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Shuken, Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield's general counsel,
said: ``We're continuing to determine the legitimate salability of
the property. As soon as we can get the information together, or
the properties come to an agreement, we'll make a decision about
this.''

EXEC TAKES HER `HEAVY DUTY' BUSINESS IN HAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BETH HUGHES  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For years, Alexandra Volkmann used her hands to
do more than just wave. At the Manhattan School of Music, they
carried a tune.
</P>
<P>
   They focused a camera and delivered Szechwan takeout.
</P>
<P>
   Now her hands do just about whatever needs doing at Heavy Duty,
her expanding, Carmel, Calif.-based company where she has fewer
than five employees and just one product _ Hand Gear, a rich,
hydrating hand cream without what she calls ``a foofy scent that
reminds you of Grandma's cream gone bad.''
</P>
<P>
   It fills a niche that Volkmann spotted while she was a national
sales executive for Murad cosmetics, a niche that market observers
see as an international explosion in cutting-edge beauty and
personal care products.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening is that some of these markets are so
specific, smaller players are filling the niches,'' said Bryant
Riley, president of B. Riley &AMP; Co., a Los Angeles stock brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   Big pharmaceuticals and cosmetics companies ``need big heads,
and they overlook niches,'' Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   Overlooked niches become profit centers for companies such as
Heavy Duty and E Shave, which reverse-engineered the techniques
used by old-fashioned English barbers to create a line of luxury
shaving brushes, soaps and razors for women.
</P>
<P>
   The small cosmetics companies ``are just like start-ups in
garages,'' said Steve Bock, executive vice president at Sephora,
the French beauty bazaar that recently opened its West Coast
flagship store in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly we're part of this movement where a small vendor with
a great idea, great packaging and an angle of some kind can stand
out. It opens the industry to any talented person,'' he said.
``It's the American ideal because there are no barriers to entry.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, the industry giants buy such smaller operations, he said,
citing Estee Lauder's purchase of the fashion-forward MAC line of
cosmetics and the streamlined Bobbi Brown line.
</P>
<P>
   But the small, privately held companies can continue to grow
independently. ``They're wonderful because they have such clear and
simple ideas,'' Bock said of the little outfits with big products.
</P>
<P>
   As for Volkmann, it's tough to get much more focused than her
stated goal of making the best hand cream. Period.
</P>
<P>
   How she came to realize her dream reads like a case study for a
small cosmetics concern.
</P>
<P>
   Volkmann's venture began about four years ago, when she realized
she wanted her own cosmetics company with a single product she
could sell as a gift or personal care item, something ``that would
cross over into different markets.''
</P>
<P>
   She needed something heavy-duty, she told her friends.
</P>
<P>
   With repetition came clarity. In ``Heavy Duty,'' she found a
company name.
</P>
<P>
   Next came a marketing concept. Nostalgia for the late '50s and
early '60s appealed to Volkmann, as did their retro look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked the women of that era,'' Volkmann said. ``I thought of
them as resourceful, strong, able to do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Volkmann flashed on the cars, or rather land yachts, of
that era with their ``come hither'' chrome and big fins. She said,
``I liked the idea of body parts being analogous to car parts,
where you want great performance.''
</P>
<P>
   That led to the marketing mantra for her ``no-nonsense cosmetics
company that incorporates an automotive concept with a retro edge.
We'd go the extra mile'' for customers.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Volkmann figured out her product: hand cream, something
with universal appeal. Hand Gear would be the product name, she
decided, dedicating it ``to hands that do more than just wave.''
</P>
<P>
   In February 1998, Volkmann launched Hand Gear at the upscale
Fred Segal Essentials in Santa Monica. Acceptance at this outlet, a
bellwether in the industry, would put her on the right track.
</P>
<P>
   Now after a year of more-than-satisfying sales growth, Volkmann
prefers not to think about the possibility of selling her company,
because that was never her goal. ``I'd like to nurture this company
as much as I can,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see this baby fly.''
</P>
<P>
   At $15 for a 3.5-ounce tube, Hand Gear isn't cheap, but its fans
aren't deterred. Volkmann now services more than 500 accounts,
representing a range of retail outlets: department stores; upscale
cosmetic shops; small specialty clothing stores with big industry
clout, like Barney's and Henri Bendel in New York; gift shops at
The Whitney Museum and The American Folk Art Museum; and home
furnishing stores.
</P>
<P>
   She has also garnered coveted mentions in the glossy fashion
magazines.

OAKLAND TAPS OFFICER FROM TOUGH DISTRICT TO HEAD POLICE FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 and ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Mayor Jerry Brown tapped the young captain in
charge of East Oakland's toughest neighborhoods as the new police
chief with a mission to change his city's crime-ridden image.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Richard Word, 37, is a 15-year department veteran who has
reduced drug-related violence in the flatlands near the Oakland
Coliseum and the San Leandro border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to drop crime more than the national average,'' Brown
said Tuesday. ``Oakland suffers from a perception of high crime.
That perception will only go away with a dramatic drop in crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a onetime governor of California, said he wanted the
nation to see Oakland as a model for sensitive community policing
that respects every person in Oakland yet does not tolerate violent
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has handled one of the toughest districts in America in
East Oakland and he's done a good job,'' Brown said of Word. ``He
has that balance between being sensitive to the community but
driving crime down. That's a very difficult balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Word replaces Joseph Samuels, who was ousted in March after
Brown and City Manager Robert Bobb said the city's crime rate was
not dropping fast enough in this city of 370,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Word committed himself to a 20 percent reduction in crime in his
first year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to work smarter. In my career, we've never had a
numerical goal'' of cutting crime, Word said. ``I see it as a
challenge for everyone in the department. But it's something I
believe we can deliver.''
</P>
<P>
   Crime has fallen in Oakland over the last several years.
According to national crime statistics released by the FBI this
week, Oakland's homicide rate last year dropped 27 percent, robbery
fell 23 percent and aggravated assault dipped 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, forcible rape jumped 11 percent and burglary and
motor-vehicle theft increased 3 and 4 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the improvement, Oakland's crime rate is still among the
highest of all major cities in California.
</P>
<P>
   Word said his priority is not only to change the reality of
crime in Oakland, but the perception as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``My voice mail fills up with people who are talking about
fear,'' Word said. ``If people are afraid of crime, then there is
too much crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Word, a San Francisco native, is the department's second black
chief. He said he had no tolerance for brutality and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   His predecessor had sparred with the City Council over community
policing and overtime for officers. Samuels could not be reached
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The department has only about 670 officers but Word hopes the
City Council will pass a new budget to increase the force to about
750.
</P>
<P>
   Word was valedictorian of his recruiting class at the Oakland
Police Academy. He was promoted to captain in 1997 after four years
each as a sergeant and lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   He completed college last year at age 36, after juggling
business classes at John F. Kennedy University in Contra Costa
County around his police work, graduating cum laude. He is working
on a master's degree in public administration from Golden Gate
University.

NOBEL WINNER TO HEAD NASA UNIT

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ NASA's scientific search for alien life now has
a world-famous director, a Nobel laureate.
</P>
<P>
   Baruch Blumberg, who won the 1976 Nobel Prize for physiology and
medicine, will be the new head of the space agency's Astrobiology
Institute based at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif.,
space agency chief Daniel S. Goldin announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Best known for his work in developing the hepatitis B vaccine,
Blumberg is senior adviser to the president at Fox Chase Cancer
Center in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The search for possible life on Mars and other worlds has
attracted growing attention from NASA in recent years, and Blumberg
should bring ``powerful and committed leadership'' to the quest,
Goldin said. ``We are extremely fortunate to have a person of his
scholarship, experience and accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Blumberg gives the scientific search for alien
life something it has lacked for almost two decades, a leader of
Nobel Prize caliber. The last Nobel laureates to be major figures
in the field were the late Melvin Calvin of Berkeley and Joshua
Lederberg, formerly of Stanford. Lederberg played a central role in
the research from the 1950s to the 1970s and was a close associate
of the late planetary scientist Carl Sagan.
</P>
<P>
   The Astrobiology Institute was founded last year. It is more a
virtual organization than a physical one. Using computer networks,
it ties together researchers at NASA centers, universities and
other institutions. Its researchers study not only the possibility
of alien life but how life began and evolved on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people worldwide afflicted with hepatitis B has
plunged dramatically since Blumberg's discovery of the vaccine, a
NASA spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Educated at Columbia University, where he received his medical
degree, Blumberg later received a doctorate in biochemistry at
Oxford. He previously taught biology at Stanford. He and his wife,
Jean, have four children.

   QUICK-REFUERBISH (New York) _ Carey Maloney and Hermes Mallea,
the designers of M (Group), were reeling their rolodexes and
flexing their shopping-arm muscles on behalf of Barry Gesser, a
single, 35-year-old hedge-fund manager who had purchased a house in
Bedford, N.Y., and on Memorial Day asked the designers to ``pull
his place together'' by the Fourth of July. He wanted it done _ and
spare no expense: Ten bedrooms, a pool house, stables, tennis
courts and two three-car garages _ overhauled, outfitted and
furnished (down to a selection of clothes hangars) in six weeks. By
Julie Iovine.

   HISS-APARTMENT (New York) _ In the center of the mantel, there's
an eight-inch wood plaque bought in the gift shop at the Federal
penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pa. The painted plaque shows the prison
as it looks now, and as it looked when Tony Hiss's father, Alger
Hiss, occupied a cell there, convicted of perjury back in the 1950s
for saying he didn't pass secrets to Whittaker Chambers, an
admitted Communist spy. The plaque is the newest memento in the
Hiss apartment, the same two-bedroom flat on East Eighth Street
that Alger and Prossy Hiss rented in 1947, when they moved up from
Washington; the apartment where Tony Hiss grew up; the apartment
that Hiss, now 57, shares with his own son, Jacob, 7, and his wife,
Lois Metzger, who writes sophisticated novels for teen-agers. By
Tracie Rozhon.

   POP-RESTAURANT (New York) _ Pop, which opened in April, is much
more than just a deafeningly hot eatery with no sign in front. Read
the menu. Not the entrees or appetizers: a page at the back, titled
``About Pop.'' It's a mouthful: ``Pop is based on the post-war
social idealism and trust in technological innovation, mass
production and pre-fabrication. While it resonates with this
mid-century American dream, Pop has been realized with
end-of-the-century means....'' The author is Ali Tayar, the
architect who conceived this 2,500-square-foot temple of
retro-contempo chic. By Rick Marin.

   HORSE-CHESTNUT (New York) _ I was in one of those
down-at-the-mouth moods one morning last week as my cab tore down
Fifth Avenue, when a horse-chestnut tree hailed me from Central
Park. Its pyramidal white blooms _ like giant vanilla cones _ rose
high above the other trees, and I could swear some kind of cosmic
wink passed between us. If you have ever seen a horse chestnut in
bloom you know how impossible it is to ignore. It stands on the
greensward like some king in full regalia: velvet, satin, jewels,
scepter, the tall, magnificent bearing. By Ann Raver.

   KUKES, Albania _ Yet again, someone has inadvertently tripped
over the parrot cage, sending it tumbling across the stone floor.
Feathers are flying and the birds are squawking.
</P>
<P>
   It is an almost nightly ritual. But the stereo speakers are
blaring an Albanian pop song at peak volume, so few in the crowded
outdoor bar seem to notice the distressed birds or the embarrassed
patron trying to set the cage upright.
</P>
<P>
   Conversations only really come to a halt, and then only briefly,
when the thunder of a distant explosion echoes off the walls, as it
does often here at the edge of the war over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In fiction, Casablanca had Rick's American Cafe. In fact, Beirut
had the Commodore Hotel bar. Every war has its meeting place for
spies, mercenaries and diplomats, aid workers, correspondents and
drunks.
</P>
<P>
   Kukes has the Bar Amerika, a place so bizarre you may think it
is fiction, but indeed it is fact.
</P>
<P>
   Its location near the heart of the Kosovo refugee crisis has
made it the prime gathering place in Kukes, a grimy little town in
northern Albania made world-famous as hundreds of thousands of
refugees from embattled Kosovo province descended upon it over the
past two months.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner of the bar, a volunteer guerrilla fighter from the
Bronx is about to join the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, or KLA, at
the front. In another, Irish aid workers discuss their latest
strategy for delivering food to refugees, while the local mobsters
at another table are overheard to openly brag about how much of it
they've stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are popular in Albania these days, and not just for
their dollars. We're seen as the savior, Uncle Sam come to drive
back the Serbs and win one for the ethnic Albanian refugees.
Perhaps like no other time or place since Korea, or the early days
of Vietnam, have such a poor people put so much faith in U.S. power
and moral authority.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the bar, Mushli Lleshi(CQ), a man who could pass
for Moammar Gadhafi's stunt double, has never been to America. But
a U.S. bank helped him secure his loan a few years ago to build the
place. So in tribute capitalism, he named it Bar Amerika.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, in a courtyard trimmed with hedges, there is cafe
seating with umbrellas advertising Coca-Cola. Inside is dark and
smoky, with the stereo blaring and a television usually tuned to a
satellite news channel. The menu is limited and a vegetarian's
nightmare -- chicken, beefsteak and lamb.
</P>
<P>
   During the meal, either the pregnant mutt or the one-eyed cat or
both will nose your leg, begging for food. A hen and her chicks
occasionally wander into the courtyard scratching and pecking for
scraps.
</P>
<P>
   Kukes is several miles from the border of Kosovo and the rumble
of explosions echo through the town day and night, forcing a brief
lull in the din at the Bar Amerika.
</P>
<P>
   The patrons soon return to their Heinekens and chatter, each
offering a different theory on what we all just heard -- the sonic
boom of a NATO warplane, incoming Serb artillery, outgoing Albanian
army artillery, or a rocket-propelled grenade from the nearby KLA
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Mounted on either side of the bar's courtyard entrance are
mortar shells, placed there by the owner soon after the joint
opened in 1997 and a bloody coup in Albania followed. They are a
reminder for others here in lawless, bandit-ridden northern Albania
not to mess with the Bar Amerika.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars and Stripes and an Albanian flag fly from the balcony.
And Old Glory drapes a model of the Statue of Liberty, which stands
behind the bar. Elton John's greatest hits, apparently one of the
few Western CDs in possession of the barkeep, play often. The song
``I'm Still Standing,'' is popular with the small crowd of Kosovar
Albanian refugees working as translators for the media and relief
workers.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent night, an Albanian-American from New York, Vasel
Lulgjuraj, stopped by with some friends from the KLA to celebrate
before he departed for the front the following day to join the
guerilla war against Serb forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was born in Kosovo, Lulgjuraj is all Bronx,
developing since the age of three a ``Yo, Vinnie!'' accent and a
New York state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I told 'em, 'Hey I been trainin' five friggin' weeks. Send
me to the front, or I'm goin' home' So, I'm goin' to the front,''
he told me, proudly displaying his KLA dogtags.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Army veteran trained with an M-16, he is now carrying an
AK-47.
</P>
<P>
   He's also carrying an attitude common to many of the foreigners
who crowd daily and nightly into the Bar Amerika, guerrillas or
humanitarians, journalists or U.N. bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I saw those women and children on CNN and I said, 'I
gotta get over there and help,''' said Lulgjuraj. ``Somebody's
gotta do something for these people.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Westerners who have come to the most remote and
destitute part of Europe, the Bar Amerika is a oasis from where
most of them have spent the day -- in the dusty and wilting refugee
camps, listening to heartbreaking tales from the victims of the
Serbs' ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   For journalists, Bar Amerika is not only a retreat, but also
part of the beat.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a reporter with experience at nursing your drink, you
can occupy a table on the bar's front courtyard and expect in the
course of an hour or so to see almost anyone you'd want to
interview.
</P>
<P>
   War and refugees have been very good for the owner of Bar
Amerika.
</P>
<P>
   Not so good, though, for his parrots.

SPECIAL EFFECTS CAN'T COMPENSATE FOR PLODDING PLOT AND SKIN-DEEP
CHARACTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'd hate to be a parent taking my kids to ``Star Wars: Episode I
_ The Phantom Menace,'' because every scene is loaded with
figurine-ready characters and objets d' hustle. The movie is bound
to inspire trips to Taco Bell and KFC for the toy tie-ins. If the
first ``Star Wars'' used ``Triumph of the Will'' to make a point,
then this one's about the success of commercialism. It's ``Triumph
of the Till.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no way that a movie as massively hyped as ``Star Wars:
Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' could possibly live up to
expectations. ``Phantom Menace'' has received the kind of media
attention generally reserved for natural disasters, a category in
which some think this ``Star Wars'' prequel belongs. Several of the
set pieces are fun, such as a race involving pod racers (the craft
Luke Skywalker drove in the first ``Star Wars'') and a light saber
battle with Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and the young
Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) taking on the decoratively faced
Darth Maul (Ray Park). ``Phantom'' is crammed with events,
characters and story line, and yet it's often boring because it
manages to seem as if nothing's going on. It's a mile wide and a
centimeter deep.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, no one who's seen any of the previous ``Star Wars''
films _ and there are apparently several of you out there _ should
be shocked to note that ``Phantom'' is clunky and heavy on
portentous exposition. What might catch you unawares is that the
battle between Good and Evil _ the operatic struggle that made up
the first three films _ has been downsized for a skirmish over
trade treaties and taxation. These discussions are like an
intergalactic version of C-SPAN. If you're not as deeply concerned
with the politics of the Empire as are ``Star Wars'' devotees, then
the first 40 minutes will be like catching one of the later
episodes of ``Babylon 5,'' a phenomenon like walking into the
middle of an unsubtitled foreign film.
</P>
<P>
   The characters fall into two groups, grim-faced worriers or
slapsticky comic relief figures. ``Phantom'' could use a character
with the cheery bravado of Han Solo, or at least an actor like
Harrison Ford, with his matinee-idol brusqueness. You'd think Ewan
McGregor was hired for his roughneck charm, but as Obi-Wan, he's
fallen into imitating Alec Guinness' tony inflections. Guinness
radiated slyness, and McGregor's appropriation makes him seem
laminated. He's a humorous, physical actor, and while there's
dialogue alluding to his wild streak, his Obi-Wan talks as if he's
waiting for the afternoon tea trolley to roll around. But there's
not much anyone can do with lines like, ``I sense a disturbance in
the Force.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Phantom'' squanders more acting talent than any movie in
recent history. Like McGregor, its other potential swashbuckler,
Neeson, intones his lines in a dead voice. He wears the horsehair
wig that Val Kilmer sported in ``Willow'' _ another George Lucas
epic that took its fable aspects too seriously. (Why is it that a
film that does such an admirable job in creating computer-generated
special effects couldn't hide the glue holding the wig to his
head?) It's no wonder that he thought about retiring from show
business after finishing this movie _ he doesn't get to do any
acting in it. Poor Natalie Portman, who has talent to burn, is
reduced to a bad kid actor as Queen Amidala. Her fakey royal accent
seems to suggest she's been reading too much of Jewel's poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Although had she given a deeper performance, the scenes with
Portman cruising 9-year-old Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd, who's
standard kid-actor adorable) might have been disconcerting. They
will become the parents of Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia. Lucas
didn't bother to write a personality for Anakin or, for that
matter, anyone else. They're all archetypes from an aerosol can.
The actors are handled miserably _ having to act with
computer-generated images (CGIs) that were added later clearly wore
them out. Even Samuel L. Jackson's insolence has been tamed. He has
an extended cameo as Mace Windu, a member of the Jedi Council, and
his eyes burn like a light saber, but he barely gets a chance to
stand up.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the movie was created by computer, and this
includes a number of the characters, like Jar Jar Binks, the
amphibious character who becomes a sidekick to Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan.
His patois must've been influenced by Jamaicans, and his elongated
ears suggest dreadlocks. It's almost as if Lucas is trying to
counter the benign racism of the first ``Star Wars'' by showing
that not only do blacks exist in outer space, but black culture
does as well. At one point, a happy Jar Jar _ whose name is
reminiscent of Shabba Ranks (and whose movements were created by
dancer Ahmed Best) _ breaks into the Smurf, just so we know he can
get his freak on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phantom'' is certainly a movie created for kids, but that
motivation seems to eliminate filmmaking excitement. Don't expect
another bolt of the folklore ingenuity and the intersecting of
magic that made the first ``Star Wars'' an unusual occurrence.
Irony abounds. Director George Lucas pioneered a kind of movie made
of a number of scenes, instead of just one, that became a
video-game template. So when he falls back on it _ like in the pod
racing scene _ you feel as if you're watching an imitation of a
video game. And although computers have freed him to create
whatever tableau his mind's eye can envision, his imagination
doesn't quite seem up to it. The lighting on many of the CGI sets
has a one-dimensional flatness, as does the light on all of the CGI
creatures. You find you get a charge seeing the way the human
actors' flesh takes the light _ even the stadium-worthy satanic
makeup job on Darth Maul, which makes him look as if he hails from
the same galaxy as Mankind and Stone Cold Steve Austin. Your eyes
get bored taking the shiny similarity of the CGI stuff.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few good things about ``Phantom'' is that it doesn't
use any pop music for its score. It's touching to hear an
orchestral score played at THX-quality volume. Part of ``Star
Wars''' success was that it was a rock 'n' roll phenomenon: the
first superloud stereo movie, which really helped it draw the line
in the sand between parents and kids. And although it seems
visually stunted, the sound design is layered and detailed. And
everything that was furry and cute in the previous films is now
lizardlike and scaly _ the ``Jurassic Park'' influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phantom Menace'' has a ghostly feel, though _ it doesn't quite
register. Who'd have thought that a movie that attracted so much
premillennial tension wouldn't have a single surprise in it? A lot
of the problem comes with making a prequel, but it's a bad idea to
combine blandness and grandiosity.

ZONIANS ANXIOUSLY AWAIT U.S. TURNOVER OF CANAL ZONE TO PANAMA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DIANE SMITH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mayra Cernicek is filled with a deep sense of loss when she
hears reports from her Panamanian homeland. Relatives tell her that
jobs are declining and that the Americans are really leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Those reports are reminders that Dec. 31 _ when the United
States will relinquish control of the Panama Canal to the
Panamanian government _ is quickly approaching.
</P>
<P>
   For many Panamanians, that date will mark the triumph of a long
struggle for national pride. Lack of control of the Panama Canal
and the former Canal Zone _ a 50-mile-long community that was
inhabited mostly by American workers _ has long been an affront to
their sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   But the control may come at a cost for those who had grown
accustomed to the American way of life. Many Panamanians are
uncertain about how the Central American country will manage after
its 96-year relationship with the United States changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very worried and fearful,'' said Cernicek, who lives in
Southlake.
</P>
<P>
   Worries abound about economics, government corruption and
Panama's vulnerability against outside powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sad, because Panama is a strategic point,'' said
Guillermina Lovelace, a Panamanian living in Arlington.''It was
watched by the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The canal was built as a passage between the Atlantic and
Pacific oceans. For most of the century, cargo and passenger ships
have used the engineering marvel.
</P>
<P>
   Some Panamanians are concerned that Panama might be ill-prepared
to begin operating the canal, which the United States built during
the early 1900s at a cost of about $387 million.
</P>
<P>
   Panama's political unrest during the rule of former dictator
Manuel Noriega and many residents' mistrust of the government also
are sources of concern. Some believe that the canal will be
exploited, that corrupt officials will line their pockets and that
Panama's poor will lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope it's for the good of Panama,'' said James Gaugh, a
Panamanian who lives in Dallas. ``We know better.''
</P>
<P>
   Among nationalists, there is no question that Panama can rise to
the challenge. The transition should be seamless, they say, because
many of the laborers, engineers, electricians, administrators and
other employees who work on the canal are Panamanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are optimistic, and we believe that there exists an
awareness among Panamanians over the great responsibility we are
assuming when we take control of the canal,'' said Victor Avila, a
professor of Panamanian history at the University of Panama in
Panama City.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an old aspiration for Panamanians, who have fought
since the 19th century to the present to strengthen our national
identity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of transition are more obvious each day. The U.S. military
bases and government buildings that dotted Panama's landscape are
being dismantled. Today, Panamanians live in homes formerly
occupied by Americans who worked for the Panama Canal Commission.
Gorgas Hospital, where generations of Americans were delivered, is
now controlled by Panama.
</P>
<P>
   Balboa High School, which is operated by the United States for
the children of American canal workers and military personnel,
graduated its final class last week.
</P>
<P>
   As such U.S. landmarks stop operating, so ends a chapter for the
many Panamanians and Americans who built lives around the canal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like it used to be,'' said Denise Smith, who lives in
the Canal Zone. ``People are sad because they have to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who is married to an American who works for the Panama
Canal Commission, is among the last residents of the
U.S.-controlled territory. Through the years, thousands of
Americans worked and lived in the Canal Zone. Many were descendants
of workers who left the United States during the early 1900s to
help build the canal.
</P>
<P>
   The Zonians _ as they came to be known _ administered and
maintained the canal in many capacities, from locomotive operators
to electricians. They also provided fire, police and medical
protection for the people who lived and worked in the Canal Zone.
</P>
<P>
   Many other Americans went to Panama as military personnel.
Panama also had a large population of West Indians, many of them
immigrants from Barbados and Jamaica who were recruited to work on
the canal.
</P>
<P>
   Naomi Palmer, a Panamanian who is visiting North Texas, used to
work as a nursing aide at Gorgas Hospital. She said many
Panamanians hope that a U.S. presence will remain after Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish they would stay,'' Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Panamanians say the country has been undergoing a
transition since 1977, when the United States and Panama signed
agreements guaranteeing that control of the canal would be
transferred.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the change is difficult at first, some say, Panama must
gain national pride by taking over the formerly occupied Canal
Zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am one of the few people who think that it is important for
the country to go through this change,'' said Marcia Howell, a
Panamanian who lives in Lewisville.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the uncertainty is caused by the notion that only
Americans can run the canal, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a facade that people have grown to believe _ that unless
it is done by Americans, then nobody can do it,'' she said.

 &HT;    With a little planning, potluck can be elegant
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Potluck or covered dish dinners have been part of the American
scene since the Pilgrims and their Native American neighbors sat
down together for that first Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   In times of celebration and sorrow or to mark any occasion,
friends and relatives, neighbors and co-workers can usually be
counted on to gather together, bearing pots, bowls and casseroles
brimming with food.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's ``going potluck'' just for the sake of having a
party.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, certain arbiters of style and taste declared
potluck parties declasse. Peggy Post in her book ``Emily Post's
Entertaining'' proclaimed that the potluck party ``does not take
the place of the party you truly give for your friends. As long as
you can afford to provide even the simplest food and drink, you
should accept the entire responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is changing fast.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that potluck cuts down the time and cost of throwing a
party, offers a greater variety of treats than one person could
possibly prepare and gives guests the chance to show off their own
culinary skills. Potluck parties meld beautifully with today's
lifetstyles.
</P>
<P>
   Premeditated potluck
</P>
<P>
   Though the definition of potluck suggests an informality where
guests will have to settle for whatever is available with little or
no choice, planned potluck may not be as much an oxymoron as you
think. With a little planning you can have a potluck party that can
be as elegant, opulent and certainly as much fun as any affair you
have been planning for weeks.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   If you already have a specialty potluck dish that you have been
taking to parties for years, you may want to expand your
repertoire. Or if you are still looking for that signature dish,
the Internet has enough potluck recipe suggestions to keep you
experimenting for weeks.

 &HT;    Chiffon cake sure to recall fond memories
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Josey Debner of Roswell (Ga.) asked for a chiffon cake
like those she made 50 years ago. In response, Katie Martin of
Lawrenceville (Ga.) e-mailed this Orange Chiffon Cake recipe, taken
from a 1942 edition of the ``Woman's Home Companion Cookbook'' she
found in an antiques store.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Reser of Dunwoody (Ga.)sent a basic chiffon cake recipe
from a 1950 Betty Crocker edition, which includes several
variations that she used to send to her husband when he was in the
military.
</P>
<P>
   To make a basic cake instead of the orange flavor tested here,
use 2 teaspoons vanilla extract and 2 teaspoons grated lemon rind
instead of the orange zest.
</P>
<P>
   The publications' timing is certainly right for Debner. We hope
the recipes are, too.

</P>
<P>
   Makes 16 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: about 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 65 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooling time: 1 1/2 to 2 hours
</P>
<P>
   2 1/4 cups cake flour, sifted
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   5 egg yolks, unbeaten
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup water
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons grated orange rind
</P>
<P>
   7 egg whites
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   In a sifter, combine flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Sift
together into a medium mixing bowl. Make a well in the dry
ingredients and add oil, egg yolks, water and orange rind. Beat
with a spoon to mix well. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Pour egg whites into a medium bowl. Add cream of tartar. Whip
until egg whites hold very stiff peaks, stiffer than for meringues
or angel food.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually pour the batter over egg whites, gently folding with a
rubber spatula until just blended. Do not stir.
</P>
<P>
   Pour into ungreased 10-inch tube pan and bake 55 minutes. Then
increase heat to 350 degrees and bake 10 minutes more.
</P>
<P>
   Remove pan from oven and immediately turn upside down, placing
it so that it hangs without cake touching table (invert pan and
place tube over a glass bottle), until cool, about 1 1/2 to 2
hours. Turn up and loosen from sides and tube with spatula. Turn
upside down again, then hit edge sharply on table to loosen onto
storage plate.

 &HT;    Pates: Think creativity, not complexity
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pates and terrines are so beautiful that many may be intimidated
by the thought of making them. Don't be.
</P>
<P>
   It can be a difficult endeavor involving special pans and
hard-to-find ingredients. But it also can be a fairly uncomplicated
and creative effort.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes we offer here are in the latter category. You can
make any of them in a standard size (6 cup or 8 1/2-inch) loaf pan.
Or try dividing the recipes into two or three mini-loaf pans for
slices that better fit onto small crackers and baguette slices.
</P>
<P>
   We offer a classic chicken liver pate, but for the most part we
choose recipes featuring vegetables to reflect the season. So go
ahead and layer the flavors, and then slice into summer.
</P>
<P>
   Step by Step: Gazpacho Terrine
</P>
<P>
   Hedgerose Chef Martin Gagne walked us through the steps of
creating Gazpacho Terrine.
</P>
<P>
   Lining the pan (below). Most pates and terrines require a pan
that has been lined with plastic wrap. For especially soft
mixtures, it's important to make the plastic wrap as smooth as
possible. Gagne said oiling the pan first and then lining with
plastic wrap will keep it from slipping as you build the terrine.
He puts his molds in the freezer until needed.
</P>
<P>
   Most pates and terrines require blending or grinding of
ingredients. After snapping off the bottom stems, Gagne throws a
whole bunch of cilantro into the blender to make the gazpacho.
</P>
<P>
   For the Gazpacho Terrine, Gagne mixes the gazpacho, chopped
cucumbers and peppers and the gelatin in a bowl set in ice. That
helps the mixture to thicken and chill, speeding the process.
</P>
<P>
   Once the mixture begins to set, he pours it into the mold. What
doesn't fit, he pours into smaller molds, or timbales. The mixture
can set and be ready to serve after 30 minutes in the freezer or
about 2 hours in the refrigerator. You can slice and serve from the
terrine or unmold it onto a chilled platter.

   Gazpacho Terrine
</P>
<P>
   Makes 12 servings Preparation time: 1 hour, 30 minutes Chilling
time: 2 hours
</P>
<P>
   Hedgerose chef Martin Gagne demonstrated this terrine for us in
his restaurant kitchen. It's a fairly simple and delightful twist
on a summer favorite, gazpacho. When you slice it, it looks like a
mosaic.
</P>
<P>
   Our adaptation calls for powdered gelatin, which is readily
available in any grocery store. Gagne and many chefs prefer to work
with gelatin sheets, which can be found at specialty stores such as
Harry's Farmers Markets, because they are more tasteless and
colorless. You can substitute 16 gelatin sheets for the amount
listed below.
</P>
<P>
   For the garnishing oil, Gagne works with grapeseed oil, which
can be found at health food stores. Any other light, flavorless oil
can be substituted. This recipe is enough to fill an 8-cup mold. If
you have a 6-cup loaf pan, you can work with that and pour the
remaining mixture into smaller pans, molds or cups.
</P>
<P>
   4 1/4-ounce envelopes gelatin

   1 1/2cups tomato juice
</P>
<P>
   Pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2cups grapeseed oil
</P>
<P>
   Coat an 8-cup terrine or mold with oil and then line with
plastic wrap and place in freezer. In a small heatproof bowl,
combine the gelatin and water and set aside. Clean and remove the
seeds from the roasted red peppers and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Place two of the cucumber halves in a blender or food processor
along with the quartered red onion. Add the lime juice, olive oil,
3 roasted peppers, garlic and saffron. Blend or process until all
ingredients are fairly well-chopped.
</P>
<P>
   Add the Tabasco and salt to taste. Snap the bottom half of the
stems off one bunch of cilantro and throw into the blender whole
and process again. Then add the tomato juice (if your blender or
food processor has a small capacity, mix in a large bowl). Pour
gazpacho mixture into a large bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Chop the remaining roasted pepper and thickly slice the
remaining cucumber halves. Toss the pepper and cucumber in a small
bowl together with salt and pepper to taste and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the gelatin over simmering water, double-boiler style,
until just dissolved. Add the pepper and cucumber mixture to the
gazpacho mixture and then stir in the gelatin until well-combined.
Place this bowl into a larger bowl filled with ice or ice water and
stir, scraping the sides of the bowl until the mixture begins to
thicken and chill, about 5-7 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the mold from the freezer. Pour the mixture into the
mold. Put the mold in the freezer for 30 minutes or the
refrigerator for 2 hours. Meanwhile, combine the remaining two
bunches of cilantro, bottom stems removed, and the grapeseed oil in
the blender and blend thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   Strain this mixture through a strainer lined with several layers
of cheesecloth into a bowl or bottle. You will have about 1 cup.
When terrine has set, serve individual slices on plates drizzled
with the cilantro oil.

   Chicken Liver Pate
</P>
<P>
   With Fig Preserves
</P>
<P>
   Makes 2 cups
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 30 minutes Cooking time: 20 minutes Chilling
time: 5 hours
</P>
<P>
   A classic pate usually includes livers or liver in combination
with other meats. This one is simple, yet divine. And finally,
here's a good way to finish off last summer's fig preserves. If you
don't have any, check gourmet or specialty stores. But this pate
will work fine without the fig topping.
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup (1 stick) unsalted
</P>
<P>
   butter, divided
</P>
<P>
   2medium onions (about 3/4 pound), chopped
</P>
<P>
   1pound chicken livers, trimmed, patted dry and seasoned with
salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup tawny port
</P>
<P>
   1/4teaspoon ground allspice
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/3cup fig preserves, chopped fine
</P>
<P>
   Toast points or water
</P>
<P>
   biscuits as an
</P>
<P>
   accompaniment
</P>
<P>
   In a large skillet over medium-high heat, melt 2 tablespoons
butter. Add onions and cook, stirring constantly, until they are
soft but not brown, about 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a food
processor.
</P>
<P>
   In the same skillet, melt an additional 2 tablespoons butter
over medium high heat. Add the chicken livers. Cook, stirring
constantly, for about 5 minutes, until they are firmed and cooked
through, but still pink in the centers. Transfer the livers to the
food processor with the onions.
</P>
<P>
   Add the port to the skillet, bring it to a boil and deglaze the
skillet, scraping up the brown bits, for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the
port to the food processor with the remaining 4 tablespoons butter,
the allspice, lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste. Puree the
mixture until it is very smooth, and force it through a fine sieve
into a bowl. Line an oiled 2-cup mold or pan with straight sides
with plastic wrap and pour in the pate. Chill, covered, for 5
hours, or until firm. The pate may be made 4 days in advance and
kept covered and chilled. Invert the pate onto a plate, discarding
the plastic wrap, and smooth the top and sides. Spread preserves on
the top and serve with the toast points or water biscuits. _ From:

   Asparagus and Shiitake Mushroom Terrine
</P>
<P>
   Makes 24 1/2-inch slices
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 25 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Assembly time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>

   This terrine is as delicious as it is impressive. When you slice
through it, the asparagus gives the effect of green polka dots. We
found it in ``Martha Stewart's Hors d'Oeuvres Handbook'' (Clarkson
Potter, $35). She calls for a 12-by-2 1/4-inch metal terrine pan.
We found one (but only one) at Williams-Sonoma. But we tried it in
a standard 8 1/2-by-4 1/2-inch loaf pan and it worked beautifully.
The recipe calls for labneh cheese, which is a Middle Eastern
yogurt cheese spread. The new Whole Foods grocery at Briarcliff and
LaVista roads carries it. But you can substitute any yogurt cheese.
</P>
<P>
   12medium shiitake mushrooms, stems removed
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4medium leeks, white parts finely chopped and greens separated
into leaves, well washed
</P>
<P>
   1small bunch thin asparagus, about 16 spears
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup fresh goat cheese
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup labneh cheese
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Line metal terrine or loaf pan with
plastic wrap, leaving a 3-inch overhang of plastic on each side. In
a medium bowl, toss the mushrooms with 2 teaspoons of salt, the
pepper and 2 tablespoons olive oil. Arrange on a baking sheet and
bake until roasted and golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer the
sheet to a rack to cool completely.
</P>
<P>
   While the mushrooms are roasting, heat the remaining olive oil
over medium heat in a large saute pan. Add the chopped leeks. Cook,
stirring occasionally, until softened and translucent, about 5
minutes; do not allow the leeks to brown. Transfer the leeks to a
medium bowl to cool.
</P>
<P>
   Bring a medium pot of heavily salted water to a boil. Add the
asparagus and cook until tender, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a
colander and rinse under cold running water. Drain and set aside.
To the same pot, add the leek greens and cook until tender, 2 to 3
minutes. Transfer the leeks to a colander, rinse under cold running
water, and drain.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium bowl, combine the goat cheese, labneh, and remaining
salt with the sauteed leeks; using a rubber spatula, stir until
smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange the leek greens in the pan crosswise and slightly
overlapping, with the ends of the greens hanging over the edges.
Using a small rubber spatula, spread a thin layer of the cheese
mixture along the bottom of the terrine.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange 1 layer of asparagus over the cheese mixture; trim the
asparagus to fit. Cover with another thin layer of the cheese
mixture, followed by another layer of asparagus.
</P>
<P>
   Continue with another thin layer of the cheese mixture and a
layer of mushrooms. Repeat with 2 more layers of asparagus and
cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Fold the overhanging leeks over the top of the terrine. Seal
with the overhanging plastic wrap. Place on a baking sheet, top
with a second baking sheet, and place a weight on top (a heavy
cookbook works well). Refrigerate overnight. The terrine may be
made 2 days in advance, tightly wrapped, and refrigerated until
ready to serve.
</P>
<P>
   To unmold, unwrap the plastic from the top of the terrine, place
an inverted serving platter over the terrine, and quickly turn the
terrine over onto the platter. Gently remove the mold and the
plastic wrap. Using a serrated knife, cut the terrine crosswise
into 1/2-inch slices. Arrange a slice on crostini, toast points or
crackers, and serve.

   This pate is about as easy as they come, and it makes enough to
serve a party. In fact, if you were really pressed for time, you
could buy the pesto sauce, too. If you want to achieve a nice
layered look when you unmold it, try setting it in the freezer for
about a half-hour, and then turn it out. Then allow another
half-hour to soften before serving.

   Lydie Marshall included this recipe in her book ``A Passion for
My Provence'' (HarperPerennial, $15). It tastes like ham salad
taken to a gourmet level. She recommends first-quality ingredients.
Go to the deli counter to get the ham and choose imported Gouda for
best results. The hardest part of this dish is slicing both the
zucchini and the cheese thinly and evenly. Use your sharpest knife
or best gadgets, like a mandoline.
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   3or 4 medium zucchini, unpeeled, and cut in 1/8-inch slices
</P>
<P>
   1pound boiled ham, rind and fat discarded
</P>
<P>
   1/4pound lightly smoked ham, rind and fat discarded
</P>
<P>
   2eggs
</P>
<P>
   1large clove garlic
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   7ounces imported Gouda cheese, cut in thin slices
</P>
<P>
   Bring several quarts of salted water to a boil. Add zucchini and
when the water comes back to a boil, cook for 2 minutes. Drain.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Oil a 6-cup loaf pan or terrine and
place overlapping slices of zucchini on the sides and bottom of the
pan. Refrigerate 15 minutes. Coarsely grind the hams in a food
processor. Add eggs, garlic and pepper; process until it makes a
fine paste. You should have about 3 cups.
</P>
<P>
   Place alternate layers of ham and Gouda slices in the loaf pan.
(If you have leftover zucchini slices, feel free to include layers
of those as well.) Sprinkle with freshly ground pepper. (The ham
mixture will probably provide enough salt.)
</P>
<P>
   Tap the pan on the counter to pack it down; cover with a double
layer of aluminum foil. Place the pan in a water bath and bake for
45 minutes. Set aside to cool. Refrigerate at least 4 hours before
unmolding.
</P>
<P>
   To unmold: Warm the blade of a knife. Gently pass the warm blade
between the loaf and the pan. Turn the pan over on a platter; hit
the bottom of the pan with the handle of the knife to dislodge.

 &HT;    Picnicking with pate? Let your romantic side cut loose and
create one elegant spread
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spring is luring us from our dinner tables to the porch, the
back yard, the park and the lakeside for fresh-air dining. And for
large family gatherings and neighborhood block parties, grilled hot
dogs and Mom's potato salad will do just fine.
</P>
<P>
   But for those open-air concerts under the stars or romantic
moonlit picnics for two, something more elegant is in order.
</P>
<P>
   So we borrow from the French, who fancy themselves romantics,
after all, to suggest pates and terrines. These portable mosaics of
flavors and colors are magnifique.
</P>
<P>
   Hedgerose chef Martin Gagne says that they are ideal to take to
Chastain Park Amphitheatre, where concertgoers are famous for their
elegant spreads. Gagne often offers pates and terrines made with
seasonal ingredients on his menus and has taught others how to make
them at the Wollaston Smith Culinary Center. The techniques, he
points out, can vary from simple to master-chef complex.
</P>
<P>
   A moment here on the distinction between pates and terrines.
``The Le Cordon Bleu Complete Cooking Techniques'' cookbook
(William Morrow, $40) defines pates as ``a smooth- or
coarse-textured mixture, traditionally made of meat and/or liver,
but can be vegetable or fish, seasoned and set in a mold.''
</P>
<P>
   And a terrine is ``a mold or the food contained within it, often
a pate-like mixture of blended ingredients.''
</P>
<P>
   The terminology can be a little confusing, especially as you
stray from the truly classic pates of ground meats. But the beauty
of these lovely loaves is that they are so versatile.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne explains that ingredients vary regionally in France,
depending on what's good locally and what's in season. One region
may have great fowl, another abundant pork. He demonstrated for us
a vegetarian gazpacho terrine that's ``more South of France, sunny
and summer.''
</P>
<P>
   The home cook in France is likely to be adept at making pates
and terrines that involve the layering or blending of a few
well-chosen ingredients. They are more likely to visit a
charcuterie _ a deli that sells sausages and pates _ for the more
elaborate versions, such as galantine, which can involve such
skills as braiding long strips of beef tongue and pork fat and
removing the whole skin of a duck without tearing it.
</P>
<P>
   Whether simple or complicated, Gagne says the most important
thing to keep in mind is to use the best-quality ingredients
possible. And most require plenty of chilling time _ at least
overnight. Many hold up well for two or three days or even longer.
That makes pates and terrines an ideal appetizer, since they can be
ready and waiting while you concentrate on other courses.
</P>
<P>
   While the avid cook may want to invest in a terrine mold _
usually a long rectangle made of earthenware or metal _ the novice
will do well to begin with standard loaf pans.
</P>
<P>
   Inside we offer a quick and easy tricolor vegetable pate and a
more detailed but delicious asparagus, mushroom and leek terrine.
</P>
<P>
   For a Southern twist on the classic pate, we suggest a chicken
liver and fig preserves combo; for an artful take on ham salad,
there's a ham and zucchini terrine.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have a pate or terrine in the picnic basket, throw in
some crusty bread or round crackers, your favorite cheese and fruit
and maybe a cold summer soup. Add a bottle of dry rose or other
good picnic wine, and you've got the makings for a perfect outing.
Reagan Walker writes for the Atlanta Journal-Constituion.

   QUICK-REFUERBISH (New York) _ Carey Maloney and Hermes Mallea,
the designers of M (Group), were reeling their rolodexes and
flexing their shopping-arm muscles on behalf of Barry Gesser, a
single, 35-year-old hedge-fund manager who had purchased a house in
Bedford, N.Y., and on Memorial Day asked the designers to ``pull
his place together'' by the Fourth of July. He wanted it done _ and
spare no expense: Ten bedrooms, a pool house, stables, tennis
courts and two three-car garages _ overhauled, outfitted and
furnished (down to a selection of clothes hangars) in six weeks. By

   HISS-APARTMENT (New York) _ In the center of the mantel, there's
an eight-inch wood plaque bought in the gift shop at the Federal
penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pa. The painted plaque shows the prison
as it looks now, and as it looked when Tony Hiss's father, Alger
Hiss, occupied a cell there, convicted of perjury back in the 1950s
for saying he didn't pass secrets to Whittaker Chambers, an
admitted Communist spy. The plaque is the newest memento in the
Hiss apartment, the same two-bedroom flat on East Eighth Street
that Alger and Prossy Hiss rented in 1947, when they moved up from
Washington; the apartment where Tony Hiss grew up; the apartment
that Hiss, now 57, shares with his own son, Jacob, 7, and his wife,
Lois Metzger, who writes sophisticated novels for teen-agers. By

   POP-RESTAURANT (New York) _ Pop, which opened in April, is much
more than just a deafeningly hot eatery with no sign in front. Read
the menu. Not the entrees or appetizers: a page at the back, titled
``About Pop.'' It's a mouthful: ``Pop is based on the post-war
social idealism and trust in technological innovation, mass
production and pre-fabrication. While it resonates with this
mid-century American dream, Pop has been realized with
end-of-the-century means....'' The author is Ali Tayar, the

   HORSE-CHESTNUT (New York) _ I was in one of those

high above the other trees, and I could swear some kind of cosmic
wink passed between us. If you have ever seen a horse chestnut in

<P>
   When Mary Schmidt Campbell, the dean of the Tisch School of the
Arts at New York University, walked onto the fourth floor of the
school's main building on May 12, she thought she knew what to
expect. It was the second day of the new-media art show, an annual
event where frenetic crowds and crazy computing projects have
become standard fare.
</P>
<P>
   But she wasn't quite prepared for the first exhibit: a talking
gumball machine.
</P>
<P>
   The machine looked normal enough. It was made of cherry-red
plastic and was full of white gumballs. But when she approached it,
the gumballs started to jiggle nervously. Then they squeaked with
fear, begging to be left alone. After a twist of the knob, one ball
tumbled forward, asking for mercy. When she looked at the ball, it
seemed to have a human face, twisted in anguish over its fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought it was delightful,'' Ms. Campbell said. ``I
found myself talking back.''
</P>
<P>
   The gumball machine was one of nearly 60 projects on display at
``Outside the Box: Experiments With Interaction,'' this spring's
show for graduate students in the school's interactive
telecommunications program. The students, from all disciplines,
experiment with computer technology as a medium for creative
expression.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the exhibitors were in a course called physical
computing. They were asked to create interactive computer projects
that do not require the use of a mouse, keyboard or computer
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Melanie Oswald and Craig Spain dreamed up the gumball machine
late one night a few months ago. They rigged the machine and
objects around it with sensors wired to a hidden computer equipped
with speakers. When unsuspecting people stepped on a floor mat in
front of the exhibit or turned the machine's knob, they activated
motors that shook the balls around.
</P>
<P>
   They also triggered switches that turned on recorded voices.
When the candy dropped into its dish, other switches turned on a
projector hidden in a nearby potted plant that beamed an image of a
human face onto the gumball.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oswald and Spain programmed each movement with Basic, a
simple computer language, then downloaded the programs onto a tiny
computer chip that is wired to the gumball machine. Before entering
the interactive-telecommunications program and embarking on the
gumball project, neither student had ever attempted to learn
computer code, let alone worked with electrical wiring.
</P>
<P>
   Spain majored in screenwriting as an undergraduate, and Ms.
Oswald's background is in art history and studio art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no programming experience at all,'' Spain said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the din of computerized music and the chatter of dozens of
gawking guests, other exhibitors claimed the same electronic
innocence. Their backgrounds included theater and nursing, graphic
design and chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   No one mentioned electrical engineering or computer science. But
in the physical computing course, each of them had a crash course
in circuits, cables and chips. Their fourth-floor laboratory, which
was finally empty after a week of frenzied preparation for the
show, was strewn with wire cutters, soldering irons and
screwdrivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The learning that comes through the hands is really important
for some people,'' said Dan O'Sullivan, who teaches the course.
</P>
<P>
   But Sullivan and other professors also stressed that the
computer itself was not supposed to be the center of attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The currency here is imagination, not technical prowess,''
said Red Burns, the program's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Most computers, in fact, were hidden from view throughout the
show. Some were draped with sheets under tables. Others were stuck
behind black curtains. Flashing lights and projection screens
dominated the floor instead.
</P>
<P>
   And projects made use of a hodgepodge of accessories: a seesaw,
X-ray film, baby toys, pinwheels, balloons, mirrors, household
appliances and an old wooden door chopped into pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Rania Ho, who majored in theater as an undergraduate, found her
inspiration in toasters, but she made them dance, not fly. Her
project, titled ``Toaster Fandango,'' used two banged-up toasters
fitted with sensors to detect infrared signals. By standing above
the toasters with an infrared remote control she created, Ms. Ho
spurred the toasters to dance to the rock-and-roll sounds of James
Brown blaring nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought appliances needed to be liberated from their
mundane existence,'' Ms. Ho said.
</P>
<P>
   A nearby installation took another dig at kitchen appliances:
The project, called ``Fridgeraider,'' showcased a refrigerator with
a video of a mother's face projected on its back wall. When a
visitor took a box of chocolates out of the refrigerator, the
mother taunted: ``Yeah, that's just what you need! More
chocolate.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the exhibits actually veered toward usefulness or even
commercial viability. They were not disqualified. Jonah
Brucker-Cohen and Shii Ann Huang created Netgym, connecting
stationary bicycles to computers that showed a virtual bike trail.
</P>
<P>
   Connecting bikes to computers is nothing new, but the students
hoped to create something more: an Internet-based game, where
people on exercise bikes anywhere in the world could race each
other in a virtual world while pedaling in their own homes.
</P>
<P>
   The project on display, however, didn't quite do everything that
Ms. Huang and Brucker-Cohen imagined. The virtual bike trail was
there, but they had not yet incorporated the Internet. ``It's a
kind of a cheat,'' Ms. Huang admitted.
</P>
<P>
   As the show wore on, some of the hands-on installations began to
show wear and tear. Wires snapped and sensors broke. After a few
hours, one of the dancing toasters had creaked to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ho, the mastermind behind them, was soon kneeling on the
floor with the wounded appliance, a screwdriver in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the gumball machine was still jiggling with energy.
And the fourth floor of the Tisch School had become a circus,
packed with people and reverberating with blaring music. The cries
of agitated gumballs were lost in the din.

   Zucchini Blues
</P>
<P>
   Q. ``Last year, we had zucchini that had some kind of mushy rot
at the base of the plant on some stems. It didn't seem to interfere
too much with fruit production, but I'm wondering what caused it. I
looked for bug burrowing and didn't find any.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reader wrote: ``Last year, I had four zucchini plants in
my yard, each in a different location (one in a large tub). They
each yielded five to seven very large and delicious fruit. I
overcame a bout with slugs early in the season, but later my plants
all wilted and died. They received plenty of sun and water. My more
experienced gardening neighbor noticed that the main stems near the
soil were rotted. The fruit-bearing period lasted only about three
weeks. How can I prevent the same thing from happening this year?''
 &QL; 
A. These zucchinis, and many others every year, are the victims of
squash vine borer. The borer is actually the larva of a moth, which
attacks squash, cucumber and muskmelon and does exactly what its
name suggests. The adult moths have metallic-green wings one to one
and a half inches across and look more like a wasp than a moth. The
female glues an egg near the base of the stem, and once hatched,
the white and brown larva, which can grow to an inch long, eat its
way inside and upward until the plant simply collapses.
</P>
<P>
   If you are going to rush your zucchini seedlings into the garden
in a race to make that first zucchini bread, squash vine borers are
a menace. Sometimes, they can be prevented by loosely wrapping the
lower six inches of stem with aluminum foil. Or if a close look
reveals yellowish grains of fecal matter on the ground, or if a
shiny ooze is coming from an entry hole, you can use a razor blade
or sharp knife to slit the stem upward until you find the larva.
Remove and kill the larva, then bend the stem down and bury it so
that all the cut portion is below ground; new roots may develop,
and the plant may continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
   But the best defense is to sidestep squash vine borers
altogether by starting seeds later, so that you are not
transplanting into the garden until after July 1. By then, the
adult moth has laid her eggs elsewhere, possibly in your neighbor's
garden. With the summer heat in full swing, your seedlings will
produce enough fruit to cover his unfortunate losses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Twinkling Trees
</P>
<P>
   Q. Our apartment building has a lovely and spacious garden. The
pool terrace and a restaurant overlook it. The restaurant used to
have tiny clear lights on the trunks and lower limbs of four of the
large trees near the windows. Our landscape architect told the
management that the lights would kill or at least stunt the trees'
growth. How can this be? The Henry Villard Houses use many more
lights; Tavern on the Green uses them as well. The restaurant had
to take the lights down. The manager said he would like to put the
twinkle lights back. Is the landscape architect right?
</P>
<P>
   A. While I'm not a big fan of lights in trees, twinkle or
otherwise, they do not affect a tree's growth as long as they are
not wrapped too tightly. Unlike poinsettia, kalanchoe, Christmas
cactus and chrysanthemum, which require a certain number of hours
of total darkness to start flowering, trees are not photosensitive
to the level of light from even the gaudiest display. It's easy to
forget, however, that the wire connecting the lights will not
stretch as the tree's trunk and limbs grow thicker. Left unchecked,
wrapped areas can become girdled, which can certainly damage or
even kill them. Twinkle lights may not be part of the landscape
architect's grand vision for the garden, but if you can convince
him to bring back the lights, be sure that the wires are loosely
wrapped and checked every year or two.

HANAUER BACK IN HYDROPLANE COCKPIT JUST `FOR JOY OF IT'  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HOLLY CAIN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chip Hanauer doesn't need the paycheck, doesn't crave the
limelight and, with 58 career wins and seven unlimited hydroplane
national championships, doesn't have anything left to prove
professionally.
</P>
<P>
   So why is one of Seattle's most beloved sports figures returning
to the hydroplane circuit after a three-year absence?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just too good an opportunity to pass up,'' said
Hanauer, 44, who retired one race into the 1995 season after a bad
crash in Detroit. ``I wasn't looking to come back and in fact was
really enjoying not coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``So why now? For the joy of it. Now I'm doing it for the same
reason I started racing, I'm doing it just because I love doing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Hanauer wavered on the invitation to join Fred
Leland's Miss Pico team. After a visit with Larry Wisne, who owns
the team's corporate sponsor Progressive Tool and Industries,
Hanauer was swayed to come aboard. But not until certain conditions
were met and commitments made.
</P>
<P>
   Firstly, Hanauer insisted on a one-boat team, not the multiboat
operation the team had previously tried. Secondly, even though
Hanauer is financially secure, he wanted to be paid on par with an
Indy car or NASCAR driver.
</P>
<P>
   A change in leadership atop the Unlimited Hydroplane Racing
Association was also a major deciding factor. Bob Gobrecht has
replaced Bill Donner as president and CEO of the sanctioning body.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people there now are good, ethical and honest,'' said
Hanauer, who will compete in this week's season opener at Lake
Havasu, Ariz. ``They are making sacrifices for the good of the
sport, not taking from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are the particulars of Hanauer's return. But make no
mistake, it's the big picture that truly motivates Hanauer. Racing
will be an element of his life now. It is no longer his entire
life.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happens when you endure a life test as Hanauer has.
</P>
<P>
   Three years before Hanauer's retirement from hydros, he noticed
a problem with his voice. When he talked it had a kind of raspy
tone _ as if he had just awakened. The condition degenerated to the
point in 1995 where Hanauer would physically strain himself trying
to utter words. He visited a dozen doctors around the Seattle area
who found no apparent physical explanation for the problem, causing
Hanauer to doubt himself and wonder if it really was all in his
head. It wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   The week Hanauer decided to retire from racing _ no longer
willing to chance serious injury in yet another crash _ he was
diagnosed with a form of dystonia, a neuro-motor disability that
interfered with the brain's signal to the voice.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor at New York's Mount Sinai Hospital finally had
delivered Hanauer an answer. No one wants to be diagnosed with a
serious medical condition, but at least now Hanauer had peace of
mind and a plan of action.
</P>
<P>
   Hanauer calls the frustrating ordeal the ``the darkest time'' in
his adult life. He said he felt dangerously close to an emotional
breakdown and reacted by isolating himself. There were days when he
would run errands and then come home, lie down on his couch and
sob.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had became very depressed because I couldn't figure out what
was happening,'' Hanauer said. ``I have spent the last three years
getting control of my health and the disease and learning to live
with it and manage it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a much greater appreciation for life now. In the grand
scheme of things, I'm glad I went through this. You take nothing
for granted anymore. I'm a much happier person now, much
easier-going.''
</P>
<P>
   In the three years since Hanauer began treatment for the
dystonia _ a series of injections four times a year _ he's learned
to play the guitar, climbed Mount Rainier, adopted a dog from the
Humane Society, traveled the world, read lots of books and made it
a point to watch the sun rise each morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've reinvented myself. People that knew me before,
then through the diagnosis and now see how happy I am, they worry
what racing will do,'' he said. ``And I needed to hear that
opinion, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in Hanauer's case, time away from racing was a
sabbatical, not a retirement. It allowed him time for a
self-assessment that has resulted in a complete change of mind-set.
Racing no longer represents a need for validation.
</P>
<P>
   He clearly still has that competitive drive. But he doesn't have
the greed, the obsession, the ego.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told myself I'd never live more lavishly than what I could
afford when I was teaching school right out of college,'' said
Hanauer, who lives in a two-bedroom house on a corner lot once
owned by his grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Buffett's latest novel, a ``A Pirate Looks at Fifty,''
sits on the coffee table amid several racing magazines. Three
acoustic guitars are lined up neatly along one wall. A small couch
and a stereo are the only other pieces of furniture.
</P>
<P>
   All these value adjustments, however, are not to say Hanauer
will be any less driven when he straps himself in the Miss Pico.
And his return is eagerly awaited by those participating in the
series. He is only four victories shy of the late Bill Muncey's
all-time win record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chip coming back, which is very good for the sport, will bring
a lot of attention and competition,'' said Miss Budweiser driver
Dave Villwock, the defending series champion.
</P>
<P>
   Villwock and Hanauer's former team, the big-budget Miss Bud
operation, will again be favored in the series. But truth be known,
Hanauer welcomes the challenging circumstances of his return on
Lake Havasu, Ariz., this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Miss Pico is coming off a subpar 1998 season _ a year so
disappointing the team even opted not to compete in the season
finale. The team's rebuilding project is more like a major
restoration, but Hanauer likes the renewed committment.
</P>
<P>
   It kind of parallels his own life.
</P>
<P>
   He said he already feels comfortable with the Miss Pico and
that's something he can't say about his experiences with the Miss
Budweiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``This crew may not be as experienced or highly paid as those at
the Miss Bud, but if we fail now it will be technically _ not for a
lack of motivation, and maybe I need that to keep my own passions
up,'' Hanauer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a lot of fun when I was racing there (Miss Bud).
It just wasn't comfortable. When you're winning as much as we were
winning and still not having fun ... well, that tells you
something.''
</P>
<P>
   So while so many of the greats in other sports are stepping
aside, unlimited hydroplane racing is welcoming back _ with very
open arms _ one of its legends.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't win another race, I've still had a great career,''
Hanauer said. ``This is a whole new approach, it's kind of a grand
experiment. Some would say I have nothing to gain by doing this. I
look at it like I've got nothing to lose.''

TEENY BROCCOLINI HAS A BIG NEW TASTE

<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a new kid in the produce section of the supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   The name of this baby broccoli is broccolini, and it's being
marketed by Mann Packaging of Salinas, Calif. A hybrid of broccoli
and Chinese kale, the vegetable has a sweet yet more peppery flavor
than its treelike cousin. And expect to pay prices closer to those
for asparagus for this new boutique vegetable. The company says the
higher cost results from the intensive labor required to pick the
product. We suspect it may also have something to do with the
novelty factor.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Serves 4-6
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch broccolini

egg white. Spoon mixture over broccolini and sprinkle with paprika.
Bake until topping is puffed and lightly browned and broccolini is
crisp-tender when pierced with tip of sharp knife, 15-20 minutes.

 &HT;    FCC: AOL-CABLE DEAL COULD SKIRT NEED FOR REGULATION
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington categories
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- America Online, the nation's largest Internet
service company, could attain a high-speed conduit to consumers by
investing in the cable industry, Federal Communications Chairman
William Kennard suggested Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a real feasibility,'' Kennard said, given America
Online's deep financial pockets. ``I've probably been more candid
than I should have been,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But America Online Chairman Steve Case, appearing with Kennard
at a congressional technology forum, said he knew of a better way
that a reluctant FCC could avoid re-regulating cable companies:
Force AT&AMP;T to open its high-speed, high-volume pipeline to America
Online and other Internet providers as a condition for approving
the telephone giant's pending merger with MediaOne Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not for regulating the Internet,'' Case said. ``But we
need to have some kind of light touch'' so access to high-speed
lines are not closed to companies like America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites offering complex graphics, audio and video content
require substantially faster transmission speeds than are possible
on modems hooked to ordinary telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   One of the chief gatekeepers for high-speed service, Milo Medin,
founder and chief technology officer of cable partner At Home, said
America Online would be welcome as partner as well -- ``if it were
willing to hand over 75 percent of its equity.'' A host of such
cable firms, including Cox Communications, invested in the At Home
startup venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not going to fly,'' Case said.
</P>
<P>
   Medin said the At Home venture, now in its fourth year, has
motivated telephone companies to offer competitive high-speed
services to consumers in the form of digital subscriber lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without cable, you wouldn't see this kind of innovation,''
Medin said.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of rights that America Online seeks, Medin argued,
would ``unhinge the investment community'' and stifle innovation.
</P>
<P>
   At Home currently has some 500,000 broadband customers out of a
potential pool of 15 million cable-equipped homes in its reach.
</P>
<P>
   Taking yet another tack, F. Duane Ackerman, chief executive of
BellSouth, said when it comes to bringing high-speed Internet
access to consumers, too much regulation of regional telephone
networks poses a much bigger problem than any potential reassembly
of AT&AMP;T's once dominant system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not as concerned about what AT&AMP;T can do as I am about
what BellSouth can't do,'' Ackerman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the unregulated cable side,'' Ackerman noted, ``the course
for deployment is clear. A cable company can invest its money,
invent the technology, develop new products and services and serve
its customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the phone side, the course is unclear. If we invest in
data, will we be required to unbundle elements and sell them at a
discount so our competitors can resell them without having to make
the investment? Will we have to establish a costly separate
subsidiary for data?''
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman noted that Atlanta-based BellSouth is already reselling
its broadband technology to other Internet provides, such as
Atlanta's MindSpring Enterprises, on a comparable basis to its own
internal costs.

<P>
   Cox Enterprises publishes the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and
holds controlling interest in Cox Communications.

AMERICANS PLANNING MORE TRIPS DESPITE PRICE INCREASES

   Pack your bags. Everyone else is.
</P>
<P>
   This summer figures to be one of the busiest travel seasons
ever. Industry forecasts are predicting that more Americans will
hit the road than ever before despite increases in airline, car
rental and hotel prices.
</P>
<P>
   Vacationers plan to take 271 million trips at least 100 miles
from their homes this summer, a 4 percent increase from last year,
the Travel Industry Association of America said last week in its
annual forecast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business has been booming,'' said Jim Ervin, Fort Worth
regional manager of AAA Travel Agency. ``I'm kind of surprised. We
just had our biggest April ever.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to figure what's fueling the robust tourist
economy: low inflation and high consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
   But Ervin said millennium madness might also be a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word in the industry is that next year will be even
busier, because it's the year 2000 and more people will want to do
something special,'' Ervin said. ``So some people are going ahead
and traveling this year to avoid the crowds next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Memorial Day weekend traditionally launches the summer
vacation season. This year, AAA and the travel association expect a
record 33.3 million Americans to travel during that holiday, which
would be a 4 percent increase over last year.
</P>
<P>
   PRICES ARE UP: With so many travelers out, it might be more
difficult to find good deals. Airlines expect to fill more than 80
percent of all seats this summer, said Tom Parsons, founder of the
Arlington-based Bestfares.com magazine and its Internet site,
www.bestfares.com, which track travel deals.
</P>
<P>
   Rising jet fuel prices are also likely to lead to higher air
fares, but 13 percent of Americans still plan to travel by air this
summer. That's a 3 percent increase over last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airlines are going to be very stingy on the cheap fares,
particularly to the West Coast,'' Parsons said.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, rental car rates are rising. According to Abrams
Travel Data Services in Long Beach, Calif., rental car rates rose 5
percent last year and will jump 2 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel prices are also generally up compared with last year, but
some markets where hotel construction has outpaced demand might
offer bargains. Industry experts say Las Vegas and Orlando, Fla.,
have some of the best deals.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline prices have risen slightly nationwide in recent weeks,
but the Southwest has enjoyed a slight dip, according to AAA
reports. The average price of self-service, midgrade unleaded fuel
in the region fell by 0.6 cent since April to $1.17 per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   GOOD DEALS STILL AVAILABLE: Despite rising prices, savvy
travelers can still find good deals. Parsons figures that the
airlines will turn to the Internet for last-minute sales to fill up
leftover seats.
</P>
<P>
   Most major airlines post weekend fare specials on an Internet
site or via e-mail. This year, airlines have broadened the deals to
include 10-day advance fares and some vacation packages.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the major carriers launched a Memorial Day sale
featuring round-trip fares as low as $58, Bestfares.com said. The
lowest fares are available for departure May 29 and return May 30,
but travellers can pay higher fares for May 28 departure and May 31
return. The sale requires a three-day advance purchase requirement.
Examples of round trips from Dallas/Fort Worth: $178 to Washington,
D.C. and $138 to Tucson, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons says other travel deals are out there but take time to
research. He suggests finding lodging specials by cruising Sunday
newspapers. Hotels also often advertise specials in cities where
they draw a lot of weekend tourists. For example, San Diego hotels
publicize special deals in Los Angeles newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worth going to the local bookstore and reading the Travel
section for deals,'' Parsons said.
</P>
<P>
   He also suggests looking into the airline package deals offered
to popular resorts. It's not unusual to find package deals for less
than the lowest round-trip air fare. That happened recently, he
said, in a Hawaii package that includes air fare and hotel for $600
_ $280 less than the lowest available air fare of $880.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not be the best hotel, but who cares if you save more
than $200 on the air fare?'' Parsons said.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas/Fort Worth fares to the West Coast are high because
there's not much competition. American and Delta, for example, are
the only carriers to Portland, Ore., from Dallas/Fort Worth
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   But Parsons suggests flying to Long Beach, Calif., instead of
Los Angeles. He notes that 21-day advance-purchase fares to Long
Beach have been running $318 round trip, vs. $465 to Los Angeles
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons said Dallas/Fort Worth air fares to the East Coast and
Florida are good, as low as $160 round trip to Orlando and $190 to
Boston, because of competition from smaller carriers. Additionally,
European fares are running 25 percent less than last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the troubles in Asia, a lot of carriers have
shifted more flights to Europe,'' Parson said. ``London will be a
good deal all summer long.''
</P>
<P>
   The crisis in Kosovo doesn't appear to be deterring European
travel. Ervin said he has had strong bookings to Europe,
particularly the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Florida continues to be Americans' top vacation state, followed
by California, Hawaii, Colorado and Texas. New York, Nevada,
Arizona, Washington state and the District of Columbia were the
other top 10 destination states, according to the travel
association, which represents more than 2,000 travel-related
organizations, including tourism offices, visitor bureaus, hotels,
airlines and cruise companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida is hot,'' said Parsons, who is doing Disney himself
next month. ``Everybody is offering low fares to Florida, so
everybody's going.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Educators think of them as social skills and generally try to
build them into what they call the ``early childhood learning
experience.'' Parents think of them collectively _ if at all _ as
the ability to get along with others.
</P>
<P>
   Such issues are generally confronted on a crisis-management
basis: dealing with the playground bully, with being the new
student in school, with sharing, intolerance, an argument with a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   The computer seems to figure into neither calculation. Since you
can't be social with a machine, it seems odd to build social skills
by using one. But in fact, the computer is a good tool for
youngsters to try out and try on a range of responses to real-world
social situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The computer is nonthreatening,'' said Arthur Pober, an
educational psychologist and child and family counselor who is
executive director of the Entertainment Software Rating Board. ``It
is not another child on the block who can physically confront your
kid. It is not a parental figure, who mandates certain conduct. It
can be neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   And with the right kind of software, the computer can present
scenarios and characters that allow children to place themselves in
a predicament and then experiment with what might be appropriate
responses. But of course they will not actually experience the
consequences of even the most outrageous behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Educators and psychologists note that in social skills software,
parents are essentially looking for story-telling programs with a
twist: the program should provide at least two or three
opportunities for children to choose among different courses of
action and to see how those choices play out for themselves and
others.
</P>
<P>
   Children delight in being able to rewrite the scripts, trying on
different behaviors for feel, as was discovered by four youngsters
who tested the programs reviewed here.
</P>
<P>
   The most appropriate programs should identify the kinds of
situations children are experiencing or are most likely to
experience: making new friends, for example, adjusting to a new
sibling, resolving a playground conflict.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, the packaging should indicate the social skills
that the software explores; at most, it will outline the actual
scenarios used. Check the visuals, too: settings should be
attractive, while characters should look inviting.
</P>
<P>
   The language should be appropriate for a child's age.
Alternatives should be presented in written words, spoken words and
illustrations. Many programs on the market _ and all the products
reviewed here _ offer children the opportunity to have their
stories read back.
</P>
<P>
   The best software provides support material for parents:
suggestions for exploring the scenario, with and without the
computer, and the consequences of decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is that parents can act as their children's
counselors,'' Pober said, ``which in these sticky situations is
precisely what they are supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   ROBERTO JOINS IN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Sanctuary Woods/Theatrix; $22.49; Windows 3.1 and later, and
Macintosh 7.0; ages 3 to 6.)
</P>
<P>
   Think of Roberto, a hippo, as the stealth bomber of the social
skills set. The power and effectiveness of his story _ and of this
educational package as a whole _ sneaks up on you.
</P>
<P>
   The ``you'' in this case is, of course, grown-ups. Children who
tried this product appreciated its realism immediately. Its appeal
starts with a familiar story line told by a wise old goat
(literally). Roberto wants to join a game of hippoball, but the
other hippos in the pond tell him there is no room. So he must
consider strategies for getting into the game.
</P>
<P>
   His alternatives are presented in three ``thought balloons'' at
a time, with each balloon's option written, illustrated and voiced
aloud. And after the conventional ``Ask nicely,'' what intriguing
options they are, from pretending to cry so that the others will
feel sorry, to behaviors that parents might discourage, like
handing out popsicles as bribes, or getting angry and kicking a
tree.
</P>
<P>
   What may surprise adults is what does and doesn't work. Saying
``Please'' _ a grown-up's cure-all _ gets Roberto nowhere.
Pretending to cry drives the other hippos away. Handing out
popsicles or entertaining everyone with his one-hippo band earns
him merely a thank you and applause.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, getting the attention of would-be playmates by
grabbing the ball and deftly hitting it back wins Roberto an
invitation to join a hippoball team. So does outright deal-making
(answer my riddle or let me in) and performing a magic trick in
which Roberto cleverly lands himself in the pond.
</P>
<P>
   The software has got it right. Among children, saying ``Please''
doesn't work; it never did. Nor does acting the crybaby. Kicking a
tree only hurts your toe. But proving that you can be an asset to
the team or can contribute to a fun afternoon is a promising ploy.
So is opting out by playing with another friend. Invited into the
pool, Roberto politely declines, saying, ``I'm having too much
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The program's appeal for adults, and its value for children,
doesn't end there. The instruction manual shows parents how to help
their children explore their choices at the computer. What a shame
that neither the manual nor the box touts the Parents Guide.
</P>
<P>
   In easy-to-access computerized form, it provides explanations of
children's emotional development along with the nature and extent
of their problem-solving, decision-making, planning, prediction and
evaluation of outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   Here parents will find ``When the Computer's Off'' activities,
including daily routines in which children can exercise options and
parents can discuss outcomes (like choosing to wear light clothes
on a cold day). Parents and children can also use the software to
print the makings of masks and hand puppets and cards picturing
Roberto expressing his feelings _ the basis of other social
scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roberto Joins In'' offers other computer-based activities.
Youngsters can play hippoball or sing and dance with Roberto,
selecting among musical styles and instrument. But these are
peripheral to learning social skills, and while several 5-year-olds
found them to be initially entertaining, they judged them
ultimately boring.
</P>
<P>
   CAPTAIN KANGAROO: LIFE'S FIRST LESSONS, ADVENTURE No. 2 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Knowledge Adventure; $19.99; Windows 3.1 and later, and
Macintosh 7.5.1; ages 3 to 5.)
</P>
<P>
   All right, so the allure of this product rests primarily with
its cast of characters. Many adults will wistfully recall a youth
spent watching the Captain, played by Bob Keeshan, and his crew.
Many children will know them from the current animated feature.
</P>
<P>
   But the packaging does little to signal that there is a
well-thought-out social skills program here. Instead, it emphasizes
how Captain Kangaroo will help children plan a birthday party for
either Moose or Bunny Rabbit, complete with balloons, streamers and
candles that can be blown out with the judicious click and release
of the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are other cute, if pointless, doodads in this nicely
animated program. But the heart of the matter is the Storybook
Corner, which offers several stories and ample opportunities to opt
for different courses of action; the Say Please, Please game, a
kind of Simon Says in which listening for ``please'' is central to
winning, and the Finish-My-Rhyme Board Game, where landing on a
clock card means finishing one of Grandfather Clock's rhymes _
invariably a poem about sharing, caring or being friends.
</P>
<P>
   The story-building component offers enough scenarios to keep
even adults busy trying out different responses. ``Trouble in the
Treasure House,'' for example, offers a choice between Bunny and
Joey being upset with each other and someone throwing a baseball
and breaking a window. In ``A Garden Story,'' helping Greenjeans
involves not following directions.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the Storybook Corner can backtrack to change a
decision. And although the results are often predictable, this is a
program for younger children (what is predictable for grown-ups is
novel to young children) and there are some surprises: when Bunny
picks all the carrots in Greenjeans' garden, children may learn,
for example, that he would have to work hard planting a new garden
the next day, or that it took him three days to cook and can all
that he picked. Such inventive problem-solving should inspire
parents and children to brainstorm responses to real events.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Kangaroo's Parent Tips appear on screen as carefully
labeled books on a shelf. ``Help, My Child Has Bad Manners'' is
brief and generally unremarkable _ until you come to the
recommendation that adults provide time and space for children to
``play, exercise, move around freely and make some noise'' _
recognition, perhaps, that good manners often means restraining
children's talk and movement. There is also the worthwhile reminder
that children are not perfect and that adults should not belittle
them.
</P>
<P>
   Other tips include suggestions for parent participation at the
computer and questions to put to children as they play: Did they
choose as a gift, for example, what they wanted or what they
thought Bunny or Moose would like? You get the point.
</P>
<P>
   This product offers a rich selection of parent-child activities
``Away From the Computer.'' My favorite is Everything in Its Place,
in which players cut out images from magazines and newspapers, then
draw a house on a piece of paper and practice putting things away.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring how easy it is to find things when they are put
back in an orderly manner, children are asked to find certain
objects. Now, if this lesson only worked in real life. ...
</P>
<P>
   CHOICES, CHOICES: ON THE PLAYGROUND &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Tom Snyder Productions; $99.95 classroom version; Windows 3.1
and later, and Macintosh 7.1; kindergarten through fourth grade.)
</P>
<P>
   It's a pity that this product is geared to classrooms and not to
individuals or adult-child combinations. Adults could also benefit
from the critical thinking process on which it is based: understand
your situation, set goals, talk about your options, make a choice,
think about the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Still, given the quality of the exercise, parents and teachers
should consider the Choices, Choices series of programs for their
schools. (On the Playground can be purchased at www.teachtsp.com or
by calling 800-342-0236.)
</P>
<P>
   The playground issue presented here seems simple: It's morning
recess and you and your friends have been planning to play a very
special game. You notice a youngster who is new to the school
watching longingly. With a head shaped like a triangle, he looks
and talks differently from everyone else. Should you invite him to
play? What will your friends think? Recess lasts only 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Children's voices are used to act out the simulation, giving it
a realistic air despite illustrations that are comic-strip-like and
static. There are opportunities for cooperative learning and for
discussing and ranking four goals: stay out of trouble, help the
new kid, stay close with your friends and have fun during recess.
</P>
<P>
   Completing the simulation requires working through a series of
decisions, choosing among three options at a time, and discussing
outcomes at length through the use of Consequence Cards. On one
side, each card wordlessly depicts a possible consequence of each
option. On the back are questions to help students think about what
they see.
</P>
<P>
   The simulation is wonderfully textured; no solution is
one-size-fits-all. Indeed, the same choices won't always yield the
same result. Like life, this program offers hard-won learning
experiences.

COMPUTER DESIGNED FOR GRANNY OFFERS A FRIENDLY INTERFACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By SHELLY FREIERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who is the person in the family who hasn't learned how to use
the computer either by writing notes at work or playing games after
school? It's grandma or grandpa, of course. But the computer
industry is turning its attention to this group of potential users.
</P>
<P>
   Hauser, a product development consulting company, says it has
come up with a way to make computers more accessible to older new
users, through a prototype design it calls a ``Generationally
Relevant Appliance for the Non-technical New user and a Yardstick
for the future,'' which, one suspects, was contrived to make
possible the tidy acronym, Granny.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted a friendly face to design for,'' said Ron Pierce, a
vice president who is in charge of product development. ``There's
no friendlier face than granny.''
</P>
<P>
   The prototype by Hauser comes in a box made with warm colors and
a flat-screen monitor, but its main change would be in the
interface and controls. The interface would leave behind the
desktop environment, with its folders, mailbox, trash can and deck
of cards.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, when users turned on the computer they would see a list
reminiscent of the pad next to the kitchen telephone: Birthdays,
Shopping List, Appointment Reminders and a To-Do List.
</P>
<P>
   The main part of the screen would have sections for topics like
Family, Medical, Services and Home. Selecting each of these
sections would call up more details, like, for example, a
subsection for each of grandma's three children and their children.
</P>
<P>
   The new computer would also move beyond the mouse and keyboard.
A remote control or voice recognition technology could be used to
make selections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two things everyone knows how to use are the telephone and the
remote control,'' Pierce pointed out could be sent in handwritten
form.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a market for computers for older users? Ernie Stokes, a
retired computer programmer who teaches Windows, Microsoft Word and
using the Internet to people over 50 at the Sacramento Senior
Center in Sacramento, says yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a little practice to get students accustomed to the
icons and how to navigate between menus and submenus,'' he said.
Some users also have physical difficulties controlling the mouse,
Stokes added.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the concept behind GRANNY, explained Pierce, is that
when grandma or grandpa boots up for the first time, the computer
would ``interview'' them, asking about their ages, hobbies, where
they've lived and their family and friends. ``Then the computer
would configure the screen with the things that are meaningful for
the user,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other applications might include making it possible for an adult
child to put information into the computer from a remote location,
controlling the lights and heat in the house and even linking to
medical devices like a glucose reader for diabetics.
</P>
<P>
   The basic idea, though, is to hide all the power involved in
helping grandma and grandpa run their lives behind a simple screen.
Pierce compares the computer with home appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to develop it to the point where it doesn't require an
exorbitant amount of time to learn how to use _ no one has to learn
how to use a television or refrigerator.''

LIGHTS! CAMERA! KEYBOARD! 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Portable computers have come a long way since Compaq introduced
its inaugural model in 1982, an oblong, 28-pound suitcase with a
fold-down keyboard and 9-inch, black-and-white monitor.
</P>
<P>
   But as with all things electronic, portable computers have grown
to be something of a commodity. Manufacturers now are generally
able to differentiate their offerings only by choosing from among a
dozen or so variables that are available to all of them _ screen
sizes, processor speeds, memory, software and, of course, price.
</P>
<P>
   There are notebooks, or laptops; subnotebooks, and even smaller
companion computers meant to work as a desktop sidekick.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens when a company that comes from a different end
of the business has a look at this tried, true and even a bit tired
formula? You end up with the Sony Vaio Picturebook Computer, the
only portable I have ever encountered that might prompt a user to
brush his hair and check for shaving cuts before sitting down at
the keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Sony, of course, is primarily a consumer electronics company. It
makes products people use to have fun. IBM, Dell and Compaq often
talk about how their computers will fit into your ``work station.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Sony's premiere products is the Playstation. And when you
first turn on the Picturebook, and the Vaio logo settles onto the
screen, the bywords it offers for this product line are
``creation,'' ``communication,'' ``entertainment.'' There's nothing
about ``increased productivity,'' a favored computer-industry sales
slogan.
</P>
<P>
   It's not only words that set this computer, which fits into the
subnotebook category, apart from its competitors. It's the little
eye that stares at you from atop the screen. It's a tiny digital
camera, built into the upper lip of the fold-down screen and lid.
It allows you to take digital pictures, store them instantly on
your hard drive and then paste them into a document or e-mail them
to a friend. Quick and easy. No fuss, no muss.
</P>
<P>
   When you're not taking a picture, the eye serves as a live video
camera, and the image is shown in a small window on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The little camera swivels 180 degrees so you can take pictures
of things in front of the computer or behind it. But if the eye is
pointed straight ahead, you'll see an image of yourself at work.
</P>
<P>
   This all by itself should sew up the market among narcissists
and megalomaniacs. And a woman on a long airline flight who wants
to fix her makeup before landing without waiting in the long
lavatory line can plop the Picturebook onto the tray table and
apply mascara live on camera. (Of course, a mirror would work,
too.)
</P>
<P>
   A timer function allows you to set the computer to take pictures
unattended, at a predetermined time. That brings to mind a variety
of possible nefarious applications. But surely there must be more
important uses.
</P>
<P>
   Evaluating this computer in the office one day, it attracted
scads of attention.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone wanted to have a look. But after the initial
enthusiastic exclamations, the question everyone asked was, Who
needs it?
</P>
<P>
   Sony offers several example applications:
</P>
<P>
   You're at the hospital with your wife, who is having your first
child. As soon as the baby is born, you snap a digital picture and
e-mail it to your mother.
</P>
<P>
   You're an interior designer, and you visit a job site. You take
some digital pictures of the rooms and paste them into your sales
proposal, prepared right there in the Picturebook.
</P>
<P>
   You are a real-estate appraiser required to use photographs as
part of your evaluation of a home. Take the pictures, visit the Web
site where comparable sales are listed and then write the appraisal
_ all with the Picturebook.
</P>
<P>
   The camera is quite easy to use. There's a button just above the
keyboard labeled ``capture.'' Press it once, and the camera turns
on, throwing the live-action video image onto the screen. Punch the
capture button again, and the camera snaps a still picture _ or 60
seconds of live video.
</P>
<P>
   Sony has programmed in a digital sound effect that simulates the
sound of a camera shutter, just to reassure you that the computer
really has taken the picture. (Somehow, the grinding noise the hard
drive makes as it stores the image doesn't do it.) The still
picture, or video clip, is then thrown up in a separate window, and
from there you have the option to save it or e-mail it.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is undeniably convenient, but ease of use usually
comes with a price.
</P>
<P>
   For one, the Picturebook's camera has a relatively low
resolution: 640 by 480 at best. Most stand-alone digital cameras
now offer at least twice that resolution, meaning the pictures are
that much clearer. At 640 by 480, a level of resolution not quite
as good as a regular television picture, no one would mistake one
of these digital prints for a conventional photograph made with
film. The digital print will be fuzzier.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, anchoring the camera to the computer body is
convenient in some circumstances but undeniably limiting in others.
If you're taking a photo of a room, or of yourself, the computer
camera is handy. But to shoot a specific object or person not so
conveniently anchored requires a fair bit of awkward juggling of
computer and object.
</P>
<P>
   I found with some experimentation that for many photos it's
simply easier to take the picture with a separate digital camera
and then slip the disk holding the image into the computer. In
those circumstances, the Picturebook offers few advantages over any
other laptop, except that it does come loaded with all sorts of
photo-editing and related software.
</P>
<P>
   The computer itself is less than half the size of a regular
laptop. It's only 9.25 inches wide and 1.5 inches high, and weighs
just 2.5 pounds, making it quite easy to carry around. But the
small, somewhat crowded keys make touch-typing awkward. And using
the function keys, whose surfaces are only three-eighths of an inch
deep, is a careful, deliberate exercise, even for one with
average-size hands.
</P>
<P>
   The computer's specifications are competent but underwhelming: a
266-megahertz Pentium I processor, 64 megabytes of memory,
4.3-gigabyte hard drive, 56K modem and an unusually wide, but still
small, active matrix screen _ 8.25 inches by 3.75 inches. An
outboard, plug-in floppy disk drive is included; an outboard CD-ROM
drive costs $300 extra. The basic computer sells for $2,300.
</P>
<P>
   Just scanning newspaper ads, I saw that for this price, you can
buy any one of several faster, more muscular notebooks, from IBM,
Dell or others, and still have enough money left over to buy quite
a nice digital camera _ even a Sony Mavica, which uses regular
floppy disks as the storage medium and offers double the resolution
of the Picturebook camera.
</P>
<P>
   But then, if you take those with you to the office, you won't
find an eager, curious audience gathering around your desk.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Larry Garrett, a Sears technician, didn't get a chance to see
what was wrong with the riding mower during a service call on April
3 near Benton, La. He was barely in the door of the customer's
mobile home when a tornado set it and Garrett tumbling.
</P>
<P>
   When the vicious wind had passed, Garrett climbed out of the
rubble with a broken wrist and a dislocated thumb. His Ford service
van sat about 20 feet from where he had parked it, with its windows
smashed and doors destroyed and a piece of lumber through the
dashboard.
</P>
<P>
   Picking through the mess, Garrett uncovered his Itronix X-C 6250
laptop computer beside the ruined driver's seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I would send a message to routing that I wasn't
going to be able to finish my calls for the day,'' he said. It
didn't look promising. A thick layer of debris, much of it
fiberglass insulation from destroyed houses, coated both the
keyboard and screen.
</P>
<P>
   Much to his amazement, the computer turned on and operated
normally. While Garrett's plan to get in touch with the Sears
office in Shreveport failed _ the tornado had torn away part of his
van's antenna _ he was able to look up his exact location from a
digital work sheet stored in the computer and call his brother for
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best as I can tell, the computer wasn't beat up at all,''
Garrett said in a telephone interview last month, while he was
recovering from his injuries at home in Shreveport. ``I expect to
use the same laptop when I get back to work. I'm hoping for a new
van, though.''
</P>
<P>
   You won't find Garrett's Itronix laptop at your local computer
store because they are generally marketed to corporations through
other channels. It's one of a small number of models, called
``ruggedized'' laptops. Heavier (up to 25 pounds), more costly
(some models start at $8,000) and generally less technically
sophisticated, they are to ordinary laptops what the Hummer is to
the family car. Salespeople run them through dishwashers to show
that they are waterproof. Public relations people boast about
machines that have taken bullets or been charred like hamburgers
and lived to move data the next day. Hummers have rolled their
cartoon-size tires over these rugged laptops at trade shows.
</P>
<P>
   Rugged laptops have earned such a reputation in the nearly two
decades since they were introduced that Panasonic, the only major
electronics company currently in the market, now hopes to convince
business executives that even though they don't often work in
tornadoes or dodge bullets, they, too, need a beefy laptop PC, like
one of Panasonic's Toughbooks. To that end, it is offering a series
of slightly less rugged and less expensive models _ sort of the
Jeep Grand Cherokee of the durable laptop world.
</P>
<P>
   Rugged notebooks are also produced by a number of small
companies or military suppliers. Fieldworks and Itronix are leading
manufacturers, but the group also includes Thomson-CSF, Promark
Technology, Paravant Computer Systems, Miltope, Getac, Cyberchron,
Amrel Systems and GSCS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ruggedization is not just the domain of the blue-collar guys _
everybody's notebooks are breaking all the time,'' said John
Harris, vice president of marketing for Panasonic Personal Computer
Co., playing on a widely held fear, if not a fully demonstrable
fact.
</P>
<P>
   But despite all the testosterone in the advertising, the reality
of these rugged computers is more mundane. Sure, they are hauled up
mountains by explorers, into battle by soldiers and into high-speed
chases by the police. But so far, the biggest group of
rugged-laptop users includes repair technicians like Garrett,
truckers and insurance adjusters.
</P>
<P>
   Within Itronix's headquarters in Spokane, Wash., there is a
device that some computer users might like to borrow after they
have received their umpteenth error message: a machine that tries
to demolish laptops.
</P>
<P>
   Vaguely resembling a drill press, the device has a clamp that
holds laptops, then drops them one meter, a little more than three
feet, onto a concrete floor. That may not sound like much, but new
models are dropped by Itronix at least 54 times while they are
operating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an adrenaline rush anytime you see a notebook fall from
that height even if you know it's supposed to survive,'' said Wally
Starr, the company's senior product manager, who never tires of the
experience.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious difference between a rugged laptop and its
regular counterpart is the case. Rather than the traditional PVC
plastic, they are usually clad in magnesium _ a material that is,
by Panasonic's estimate, 20 times stronger than the most durable
plastics. Some models also get a layer of thick rubber.
</P>
<P>
   But the outside box is the least of a rugged-laptop designer's
worries. Because most failures of mobile PC's come from prolonged
vibration or humidity _ or sometimes spilled coffee, rugged laptops
have special fittings for their components. To guard against
spills, the laptop and keyboard are sealed and the air drawn out,
leaving a vacuum to avoid condensation. Itronix has a special
water-torture chamber that blasts the laptops with water at a
pressure of 40 pounds per square inch.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of Pentium chips created a major problem because
ordinary Pentium laptops have a circular opening for a fan to drive
out the heat generated by their central processing units. Rugged
machines, therefore, keep their interiors sealed but avoid
spontaneous combustion by using the surrounding magnesium case as a
heat sink. For similar reasons, some rugged machines completely
eliminate speakers. Some Panasonic models contain a single mono
speaker, mounted on the bottom, that uses a membrane made from
materials more commonly found in outdoor clothing. But Harris, at
Panasonic, conceded that ``it certainly doesn't give you stellar
sound quality.''
</P>
<P>
   The two most vulnerable elements in a laptop computer are its
delicate hard drive and the liquid crystal display screen, which
contains a thin sheet of glass.
</P>
<P>
   Starr estimated that most hard drives could survive a fall that
generated about 500 times the force of gravity, or 500 Gs, if the
computer was turned off and about 100 Gs if it was turned on. A
belly flop off a desk, however, would mean a force of 1,000 to
3,000 Gs at impact. Worse, Starr added, ``it's a very dramatic,
short impact, making it difficult to dissipate the energy.''
</P>
<P>
   To protect the hard drive, manufacturers have resorted to
surrounding it with a variety of silicon gels. To further reduce
the shock, a team of two engineers spent six months at Itronix
designing an elaborate series of baffles and louvers in and around
the gel. LCD screens get much the same treatment. In most models,
they are protected from shock by being mounted in additional goop.
The most extreme models also add an outside layer of bulletproof
plastic.
</P>
<P>
   Who needs a bulletproof computer screen? The police might.
Robert Ford, director of police services in Port Orange, Fla.,
switched to rugged models for squad cars after finding that
ordinary laptops were lasting, on average, about a week because of
drops, jolts and spills.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   After six months of using rugged units from Panasonic, the
police in Port Orange have experienced few failures. One machine,
in fact, withstood a particularly grueling episode. About a year
ago, a truck traveling about 65 miles an hour with its driver
asleep at the wheel crashed into the back of a stopped police
cruiser, pushing the trunk into space normally filled by the back
seat. The officer, Steve Braddock suffered serious injuries, from
which he has since recovered. The laptop, which was in the trunk at
the time of the crash, was cut out of the wreckage by mechanics.
``For a joke they switched it on,'' Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   The machine worked. After some cosmetic repairs and a screen
replacement, the computer was soon back in service.
</P>
<P>
   But Ford has not found the Panasonic laptops invincible.
Officers still occasionally drive off with computers sitting on the
roofs of cruisers. They survive only if they make their inevitable
plummet to the pavement at less than 30 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   For other users of rugged laptops, like Jim Bruton, a former
documentary producer, surviving abuse is part of the environment.
For the third year in a row, Bruton is spending part of this month
at a Mount Everest base camp providing Internet communications and
telemedicine links for a climbing expedition. On a trip in 1996,
his Fieldworks laptop was left open overnight. The next day, it was
covered in snow and ice. ``I let the sun melt it for an hour, dried
it off and everything was fine,'' Bruton said.
</P>
<P>
   So does a person who reaches high elevations only in an airline
seat really need a more rugged laptop? Not surprisingly, the answer
from Toshiba, a leading maker of ordinary laptops, is no.
</P>
<P>
   Masa Okumura, director of worldwide portables marketing for
Toshiba, said the company designed notebooks to cope with
``inevitable day-to-day stress but not to be abused.'' The vast
majority of service returns at Toshiba, he said, are a result of
software problems, not physical damage.
</P>
<P>
   Itronix is happy to sell its laptops _ full-size models start at
$5,995 _ to anyone who wants them. But Matt Gerber, the company's
vice president for marketing, acknowledged that the Itronix rugged
laptops were overkill for most people. ``A typical laptop user does
not need our product,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Panasonic has high hopes for its scaled-down line
of rugged laptops, which are a little less tough than the more
expensive laptops. This line of machines _ some of them are to sell
for less than $2,000 each _ eliminates some of the extra survival
measures, like floating the screen in gel, while retaining some of
the macho features, like the magnesium case.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, at Panasonic, compared the notebook to the sport utility
vehicle he bought for commuting in New Jersey. ``I bought a Jeep,
not because I want to go off road,'' he said. ``But three times a
year when there's a big snowstorm, I say, `Boy, I'm glad I have
this.' The rest of the time, it just gets lousy mileage.''

HORSE CHESTNUT TREES: SPRINGTIME'S GREATEST SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANNE RAVER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I was in one of those down-at-the-mouth moods one
morning last week as my cab tore down Fifth Avenue, when a
horse-chestnut tree hailed me from Central Park. Its pyramidal
white blooms, like giant vanilla cones, rose high above the other
trees, and I could swear some kind of cosmic wink passed between
us.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if you have ever seen a horse chestnut _ Aesculus
hippocastanum _ in bloom, you know how impossible it is to ignore.
It stands on the greensward like some king in full regalia: velvet,
satin, jewels, scepter, the tall magnificent bearing. That is the
horse chestnut all over.
</P>
<P>
   And this one had just given me a swift kick in the pants to wake
up and smell the wisteria (which is blooming now all over the park)
before spring was gone and I was dead, not to get too metaphysical
about it.
</P>
<P>
   My cabby hung a right on 59th Street, and I glimpsed another
tree, its bare dark branches full of giant purple cones. What  &UR; was &LR; 
that thing? I'd seen it years ago at Winterthur in Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Then I remembered. Paulownia tomentosa, the empress tree, a
scraggly thing that looks as if it were masquerading as wisteria
without any leaves. There's something slightly dopey about it. Like
some high school kid who says, ``Everybody else blooms with leaves
on, but I'm just going to put out these big flowers and think about
leaves later.''
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, I went around the park with Neil Calvanese,
the vice president of operations at the Central Park Conservancy,
who seems to know just about every plant in the park. And as I get
older, I like knowing the names of things and their habits: not
only when they bloom, but what their little fruits look like, how
to identify them from their bark. It's the comfort of the familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't recommend the horse chestnut as a street tree,''
Calvanese said, as we stood admiring one north of Cleopatra's
Needle, near 83rd Street. I had just wished, longingly, that our
city tree pits were large enough for such giant shade trees. ``The
fruit on it is very big,'' he was saying, ``and in the summer, it
gets blotch disease and drops its leaves. But in a park like this,
it's a great tree. It has bold leaves, bold flowers and it's a big,
open spreading tree.''
</P>
<P>
   He spread his arms out wide, as if he were the tree, 60 feet
tall, feeling all that space around his branches. We walked up
close to one of its huge white blossoms to peer at this intricate
piece of nature's engineering: a 10-inch pyramid of florets,
splotched with red and yellow dots, to tempt bees. These
flirtatious flowers rise like torches out of enormous palmate
leaves, each as big as a church fan. This tree understands the
power of the sacred and the profane. I had the uncanny vision of
hundreds of virgins proceeding down the aisle toward their
unvirginal fates. A sort of Aguirre ripple in a pastoral park.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is one heck of a flower,'' Calvanese said.
</P>
<P>
   We went on to a silver linden tree just north of the Hamilton
statue, which stands behind the northwest corner of the
Metropolitan Museum. From a distance, this 60-foot tree, which is a
good 30 feet across, looks like a giant lollipop, because its
canopy is so rounded. And up close, its fresh green leaves have the
same oval shape. Underneath, the leaves have a silver-gray cast,
and hidden beneath each one hangs a little chandelier of three tiny
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're hardly noticeable,'' Calvanese said, reaching up to
show one off. ``Before you see a linden tree in flower, you usually
smell it. To sit under this tree in bloom . . . '' His voice
trailed off. ``The honeybees love them.'' He pointed out a
wonderful pair of silver lindens on the eastern edge of the Great
Lawn, and behind them, a tall pair of turkey oaks, their elegant
branches cascading with fresh green leaves.
</P>
<P>
   And if you are wondering what those fuzzy, white
caterpillar-like flowers are, dangling from the graceful trees with
dark branches and shiny narrow leaves, they are black cherry
blossoms, soon to turn to cherries and to be ravaged by squirrels
and birds.
</P>
<P>
   As for the empress trees, there's a beauty blooming in the
southwest corner of the park, near the Columbus Circle entrance,
and another by Cherry Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lanky tree,'' Calvanese said, ``almost like an
ailanthus in its coarse texture. But the flowers are very nice.''
</P>
<P>
   I kept silent next to the master. But they look like footlong
cones of purple cotton candy, if you ask me. Maybe God made this
tree for kids. The flowers are just the color of wisteria, which
smells better, and grows wild all over the place. And from a
distance, it's easy to confuse the two.
</P>
<P>
   But wisteria blossoms hang down, from green leafy vines (go sit
under the wisteria arbors near Strawberry Fields), and empress-tree
flowers poke straight out from bare branches, with nary a leaf in
sight. Just last year's seedpods, or rattles, dangling down like
old party decorations. Maybe I'm missing something, but this tree
could use a makeover.
</P>
<P>
   There is another spectacular horse chestnut near the corner of
85th Street and Central Park West. If it's finished blooming when
you get there, make a note to catch it next spring, and go lie
under the linden trees. Or the English hawthorne trees, those pink
and white beauties lounging around with the willow trees by the
100th Street pool. Now where did this pool come from? In 20 years,
I'd never noticed it.

   Los Angeles is no stranger to action sequences and special
effects. But for three days in May, the Electronics Entertainment
Expo put on a light show that was extreme even for Hollywood. The
sprawling behemoth that is the Los Angeles Convention Center was
packed to the rafters with video games _ CD-ROMs, console games,
handheld games _ peripherals and accessories of all descriptions,
as well as thousands of software developers, publishers, retailers,
investors and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   In the promotional maelstrom, the Littleton, Colo., shootings
lingered as an undeniable subtext. Congress has put popular
entertainment in the political cross hairs, and publishers and
developers are understandably defensive about being misrepresented
_ of the 1,900 titles on the show floor, only a small fraction were
the first-person shooters that have put video games in the pillory.
</P>
<P>
   Video game developers are skeptical about the political process.
``The video game industry spends no money lobbying,'' said Howard
Lincoln, chairman of Nintendo of America. ``Hollywood and the gun
industry spend lots of money lobbying. So who gets attacked?''
</P>
<P>
   But behind closed doors, with a thin layer of particleboard
between themselves and the slings and arrows of public criticism,
the major players in this industry are seriously considering the
issue of violence and interactive entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a responsibility to ask the question,'' said Greg
Ballard, chief executive of 3Dfx Interactive, speaking in an
interview; his company's graphics accelerator cards smooth out the
animation in computer games like Doom and Quake. ``Everyone can
formulate a different answer. But we at least have to ask the
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, thousands of screens blazed with the most dazzling
digital media ever produced and the promise of a spectacular
millennial holiday season. Here are the highlights:
</P>
<P>
   NEW CONSOLES All of the big console companies have new boxes in
the pipeline. The furthest along is Sega's Dreamcast, which has
already been released in Japan and goes on sale this September for
$199. It promises a superior game-playing experience, along with a
modem and a Windows CE interface for Web surfing.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo announced that its next-generation machine would be
based on IBM's 400-megahertz Power PC chip running custom-designed
DVDs _ the cartridge era is officially over.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest news by far is Sony's new machine, the
Playstation 2, scheduled for release in the fall of 2000. Prompting
double- and triple-takes, the demonstration screen (housed in a
large, sparkling pyramid) inspired reverent, jaw-dropping awe. The
visual experience blows away anything you have seen on a PC (it's
closer to the computer graphics in ``Toy Story''). And the game
platform is backward compatible _ all the old Playstation games
will work. Hallelujah.
</P>
<P>
   BASS FISHING It seems that no publisher's holiday lineup is
complete without a bass fishing title: Bass Landing for the
Playstation (packaged with a rod-and-reel controller); Field and
Stream Trophy Bass 3D; Wal-Mart's FLW Tour Professional Bass
Tournament for the PC; Bassmasters 2000 and Bass Hunter 64, both
for the Nintendo machine, and Sega's Bass Fishing, a very
impressive title for the forthcoming Dreamcast console. ``Just
think of it as underwater combat,'' a bystander said. ``With
fish.''
</P>
<P>
   PLANK SPORTS If there is any trend to rival bass fishing for
popularity, it is skateboarding and snowboarding. Thrasher magazine
is lending its name to a skating game, Skate and Destroy. So is
Barbie _ Mattel's Super Sports fits America's favorite plastic
princess with a pair of in-line skates. And yes, she can fall down.
</P>
<P>
   Infogrames' Supreme Snowboarding renders extreme snow sports
with visual panache. (The publisher is based in France, so cheeky
spectators took to pronouncing the title Su-PREHM Sno-bor-DEENG.)
Acclaim's Trickstyle took a science fiction approach, leaving
phosphorescent light trails behind high-tech hoverboards. On the
Dreamcast, you can snowboard at night.
</P>
<P>
   DO-IT-YOURSELF DESIGN Continuing last year's trend of custom
design features, this year's games provide even more opportunities
to tweak the software or make up new material. For young children,
there's software like Fisher-Price's Magna Doodle, which lets you
animate your screen scrawls.
</P>
<P>
   For their teen-age siblings, Agetec's Fighter Maker allows the
player to design combat characters. Coordinate individual body
parts, choreograph full-body movements, cut and paste motion
sequences together, and voila, home-brewed fighting moves.
</P>
<P>
   TITLES FOR THE CASUAL GAMER Not everyone wants a 3-D spectacle
that takes 40 hours. Some people want simple games that take 15
minutes. As computing moves into the mainstream, the latter are in
the majority, and publishers are racing to sell simple mass-market
games for $19.99 or less.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro leads the pack with digital versions of classic board
games as well as low-bandwidth online games (Scrabble, Battleship,
Grandmaster Chess) that send and receive moves via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   CLASSIC TV SHOWS The licensing fiesta continues. South Peak
Interactive has taken particularly aggressive cracks at the
television pinata, and all the vintage goodies are dropping out:
more Looney Tunes titles, followed by the Flintstones and Scooby
Doo. And yes, the rumors are true. There will be a Dukes of Hazzard
racing game.
</P>
<P>
   SHEEP At every Electronic Entertainment Expo, there is one title
that stands apart for sheer oddity, and this year it is Sheep,
developed by Mind's Eye in Britain and published by Empire
Interactive. The back story is that sheep were put here thousands
of years ago to observe life on Earth, but they forgot what they
were supposed to be doing and just stood around eating grass.
</P>
<P>
   Your mission is to herd them back to Mount Mouflon so they can
be picked up by the Mother Sheep and go home (Dolly meets ``Close
Encounters'').
</P>
<P>
   Game play consists of herding the sheep through 16 levels, from
Whoppy's ice-cream factory _ if you're not careful, the sheep will
be sucked into mixing equipment and emerge as sheepsicles _ to a
large, doomed ocean liner where you have to herd the sheep into
first class so they can escape on the few remaining lifeboats.
</P>
<P>
   The bleating noises are superb, and the designers have used a
mathematical approach developed on the cutting edge of computer
science and artificial life research to model flocking, so the
sheep clump and stray with uncanny realism. Watch for Sheep in
September.

GIANT OF RUNNING IS NOW A FILM STAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ While on a recent quickie trip to New York,
Haile Gebrselassie went for an hour run in Central Park, dined at a
restaurant serving his native Ethiopian food and rode a limo back
to his hotel.
</P>
<P>
   It's nice being a film star.
</P>
<P>
   At 26, being squired through America's signature city,
Gebrselassie was far removed from his upbringing in rural East
Africa, where he lived in a hut and worked the family farm under
his demanding father. An occasional flogging was the price he paid
for seemingly minor indiscretions related to his desire, his need,
to run. The father, Tedesse Haile, never saw greatness in the son.
Thankfully, others did.
</P>
<P>
   Never heard of Gebrselassie? Wave the white flag when it comes
to its pronunciation? (Geb-rah-sell-ah-see.)
</P>
<P>
   Don't feel bad. He's little known in the United States and
certainly never seen beyond the sports pages.
</P>
<P>
   But something interesting happened to Gebrselassie in the last
three years. He became the star of a Walt Disney Pictures movie,
written and directed by Leslie Woodhead, that's both a documentary
(in contemporary scenes), and a drama that faithfully re-creates
his youth. In that respect, it goes where neither of the two movies
about the late American distance runner, Steve Prefontaine, could
ever go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Endurance'' debuted in Ethiopia last fall and opens in this
country Friday. ``Everybody said it was wonderful,'' Gebrselassie
said of the film's reception in his country. ``They were happy
because it showed the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Gebrselassie is the best distance runner in the world, at
5-feet-3-inches a giant in his sport. He established world records
for 5,000 and 10,000 meters in a brilliant stretch of running last
summer on the European track and field circuit and won the gold
medal at 10,000 meters at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   So is the best runner in the world now a movie star?
</P>
<P>
   ``A little bit,'' Gebrselassie said in a telephone conversation
from New York.
</P>
<P>
   English is not native to Gebrselassie, but the language is a
virtual necessity for an international track star. He speaks in a
lilting accent that ratchets up an octave or two when the subject
excites him. Such is the case when he observes the opening scenes
of ``Endurance.''
</P>
<P>
   It's quite a sight, Gebrselassie with his little barrel chest
running like a metronome over the savanna, beside rivers and up
hills while songs with names like ``Haya Wolalome,''
``Medina/Zalesgna'' and ``Tigrigna'' give the movie a sense of
verisimilitude that the two Prefontaine movies never attained.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depicted the life,'' Gebrselassie said. ``It was very
accurate. I enjoyed it. It depicted things about my life. It was
good.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While hardship is the currency of the Third World and to
struggle is given, one of the most poignant moments of the movie is
when 7-year-old Haile absconds with the family radio (his father
was such a stickler he would remove the batteries and hide them
after using it) in order to listen to the exploits of famed
countryman Miruts Yifter in the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   With the philosophy of ``each one, teach one,'' little Haile
received his calling listening to Yifter winning the 5,000 and
10,000 meters in an Olympic Games boycotted by many Western
nations. Ethiopia aligned itself with what was then the Soviet
Union and competed against the wishes of the United States because
of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The running styles of Gebrselassie and Yifter, also
5-feet-3-inches tall, are similar, although the former has
finishing speed the latter could only dream of. Gebrselassie is
known for his brilliant smile in victory. Yifter's most prominent
feature was in profile: His elongated head formed a virtual outline
of Africa itself.
</P>
<P>
   Gebrselassie said he has met Yifter, now living an expatriate
life in Toronto, many times. ``I think we are a little bit similar,
yes. The tactics were the same. He's very good at the end (of
races). We have many similarities.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia has had other Olympic stars, though nowhere near the
volume of Kenya, Africa's true Fertile Crescent of running.

GARDEN NOTEBOOK: PRIMORDIAL EMBRACES MODERN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., N.C., Ky.)   (bl)  
 By MAC GRISWOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    NUTLEY, N.J. _ I had never done a modern garden till I got
here,'' said Richard Hartlage, a garden designer and horticulturist
from Seattle, who is now working on his first two private gardens
in the New York area. ``I had teethed on Gertrude Jekyll.''
 &HT;    The gardens face each other from opposite sides of a quiet,
oak-shaded suburban street here in Nutley, and belong to a pair of
friends, Graeme Hardie and Silas Mountsier. At the moment,
Mountsier's garden is in heavy construction mode, loaded up with
contractors' vans, brick piles and serious pneumatic equipment.
Hardie's garden is more or less complete, and contrary to what one
may think, Gertrude Jekyll would be happy with it. After all, the
English gardener loved strong architectural settings and used dark,
lush colors as often as the pale palette that most gardeners assume
she always went for.
 &HT;    Jekyll or no Jekyll, the boldness of Hardie's garden is
startling in this placid town, only a 30-minute drive from New York
City.
 &HT;    ``I wanted primordial,'' said Hardie, an architect and
anthropologist who was born in South Africa and was the director of
research at the North Carolina State University School of Design
until he retired to Nutley in 1991.
 &HT;    Primordial is what he got: torrid plants, bold geometry, sensual
artworks, strongly contrasting textures, varied path surfaces and
striking changes of level, all in a 44-foot-square garden. For
entertainment, he can jump in the hot tub concealed in the wooden
deck, or collapse with a margarita on a terrace shaded in summer by
banana trees.
 &HT;    Most of all, Hardie, 54, can lose himself in contemplating the
cobalt wooden walls that enclose three sides of the garden. From
inside them, the neighboring houses, discreet whites and pale
grays, dim to a scrim against these blasts of blue. The choice was
inspired by the Majorelle garden in Morocco, Hardie mentioned in
passing, as if there were nothing outre in importing this ringing
color to Nutley.
 &HT;    Hartlage, 35, is no stranger to New Jersey, and so the plants he
has introduced survive, even though many look tropical. Born and
raised in Louisville, Ky., and a graduate of North Carolina State
University (where he studied ornamental horticulture and met
Hardie), he spent three years as the superintendent of horticulture
for the Morris County (N.J.) Park Commission, running the
Willowwood and Frelinghuysen arboretums. ``I don't stretch the
zones here the way you think,'' he said. ``I don't believe in
pushing the envelope that much.''
 &HT;    Most of the hardy perennials that shape the underlying structure
of the garden are mundane, he said. The magic comes from his choice
of strongly colored varieties, like the gold-hued tufted sedge. And
since real tropical annuals like canna and coleus demand an equally
flamboyant background, he said, he went for hardy shrubs with large
leaves, like the red buckeye or Japanese mahonia. A few are really
unusual, like the crazy-looking variegated Japanese form of devil's
walking stick, a stubby contorted shrub with long fringed leaflets
edged in silver. Without the strength and variety of these
plantings, the garden would collapse into itself, leaving nothing
but the blue walls.
 &HT;    For all of Hartlage's consummate plantsmanship and extravagant
color sense, his point of departure for this garden, as for the
others he has designed, was the space. The house, like any modest,
turn-of-the-century suburban house, stands squarely facing the
street. But the drive cuts a diagonal across the depth of the lot
as it heads for the garage. When Henry Clark, a New York architect,
pushed a glassed-in extension out the back of the dark old kitchen,
he aligned it with the diagonal drive, not the wall of the house.
The extension's trapezoidal roof, which plays with the two
geometries at work on the place, sparked Hartlage's imagination
when he first visited.
 &HT;    ``It was important to me that the garden end up making sense of
the architecture,'' he said. In his design, he juxtaposed the two
geometries, creating planting beds and paths in interlocking
patterns.
 &HT;    ``Every garden should be a journey,'' he said, ``and it starts
with you sitting in a chair with your eyes moving around the
space.''
 &HT;    Hartlage contends that most gardeners don't use enough
architecture to anchor their plants. ``I see this place as a game
in a box,'' he said. ``I learned that from being a flower arranger.
In competition, you're often given a box to work with, and if you
don't have the money to cover it lavishly with fabric or whatever,
the solution is to draw the focus inside, and then the box
disappears.''
 &HT;    Then Hardie explained what happened when the garden came
together, in 1998. ``How to get the house to look like the garden
was the thing,'' he said. A South African muralist, Andre de
Villiers, painted the front hall with hot-colored African patterns.
 &HT;    And Hartlage's influence is spreading. Across the street, along
Mountsier's drive but on a neighbor's property, Hartlage has carved
out an elliptical space by planting an aerial hedge of Japanese
snowbell trees that float above a trim hedge. Mountsier is paying
for most of the plants and gets to enjoy the borrowed view when he
heads his car into the garage.
 &HT;    On Hardie's side of the street, a rare white redbud tree (Cercis
reniformis Texas White) is the first adventurer on the other side
of his driveway. Hartlage's gardens  are  headed on a journey _ all
around the neighborhood. 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (STORY ENDS HERE. OPTIONAL SIDEBAR FOLLOWS)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    THE JOURNEY BEGINS 
 &HT;    By MAC GRISWOLD  c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The woody framework in the garden that Richard Hartlage designed
for Graeme Hardie includes Japanese devil's walking stick (Aralia
elata Variegata), giant reed (Arundo donax), eulalia grass
(Miscanthus sinensis Cosmopolitan), Japanese mahonia (Mahonia
japonica), red buckeye (Aesculus pavia) and tufted sedge (Carex
elata Aurea).
</P>
<P>
   He also uses vines, like crimson glory vine (Vitis coignetiae),
and larger plants, like purple smoke bush (Cotinus coggygria
Atropurpurea) and the Indian bean tree (Catalpa bignonioides
Aurea). These are coppiced, or cut annually to knee height.
</P>
<P>
   Banana trees (Ensete ventricosum Maurelii) are treated as
annuals. Hartlage suggests using big containers and fertilizing
with twice the recommended dosage of Osmocote, and then feedings
once every two weeks of liquid 20-20-20. ``Half the fun is seeing
them go from this little nothing to 15 feet in two and a half
months,'' he said.

MOSEY OVER TO MIDLAND FOR MENUDO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texans like to boast a bit about their love for Mex-Tex food.
It's not every state, after all, where you can get an enchilada to
float in a lake of greasy cheese and scorching chili.
</P>
<P>
   There is a perverse pleasure to be gained from searing one's
palate with a coating of capsaicin. But there are limits.
</P>
<P>
   Menudo.
</P>
<P>
   Non-Hispanic Texans, for the most part, don't do menudo.
Especially the ones who consider it adventuresome to have sour
cream with their black-bean burrito.
</P>
<P>
   Menudo _ made with beef tripe and pigs' feet _ is way out of
bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still trying to get them to taste it,'' David Diaz,
president of Midland's Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said of his
Anglo neighbors and their fear of menudo. ``We are still trying to
convince them it is good for you.''
</P>
<P>
   It would seem that Diaz has a hard sell to make, but on the
first weekend of next month, Midland will hold its annual Mex-Tex
Cook-Off, and more than 20,000 visitors will be seeking the tripe
stew. Really.
</P>
<P>
   The annual event was held at a nearby racetrack until this year.
Now it is so big, organizers have moved it to the downtown city
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Chili and fajitas will be available at the cook-off, but Diaz
says most of the folks will be there strictly for the menudo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come from all over Texas to try this food,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul Pitts, oil and gas editor for the Midland
Reporter-Telegram, is one Anglo who appreciates the taste of
menudo. He is one of the cook-off founders; he has won the menudo
competition several times, and he is an experienced judge, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a turnoff,'' he said of menudo's first impression.
``Anglos turn their nose up at it when they find out it is cow
stomach and pig feet. It is a conditioning thing. What eventually
changes their minds is when they experience it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitts does admit that his first encounter was at a wedding in
Tijuana and that he nearly gagged. ``I tried it again later that
afternoon and it didn't taste as bad,'' he said. ``I had it again
the next morning, and two weeks later, I was looking around for
places to buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   He has come to love it. ``You can taste all the flavors
simultaneously, or separately. It's just that kind of concoction,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Menudo has a reputation for curing hangovers, although some
folks insist they would rather have a headache than consume the
stew. It is generally a breakfast meal, although often served for
lunch. Most restaurants that sell menudo sell it specifically on
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sell it all during the week,'' said Phillip Lancarte of Joe
T. Garcia's and Esperanza's Bakery in Fort Worth, ``but the weekend
is our biggest time.'' Lancarte said the restaurant won first place
a few weeks ago at a contest on the north side.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his menudo customers are Hispanic, Lancarte said, but a
fair number of Anglos try it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just use the beef tripe,'' he said. ``We don't use the
pigs' feet. But the pigs' feet do give it a good taste. They are a
good ingredient.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, a hot bowl of menudo is topped with chopped
onions, jalapeno peppers, a little oregano and slices of lemon or
lime.
</P>
<P>
   At the Midland cook-off, however, it will be hard to win without
the pigs' feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proportions should be about two-thirds meat to one-third
hominy,'' Pitts said. ``It should never be half and half. And about
one-third of the meat should be pigs' feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitts said the stew should not be too greasy, but should have
enough grease to carry the flavor. The best method is to use real
posole (dried hominy). But if it's not available, canned hominy
will do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recipes are sometimes vastly different,'' he said. ``But
we never have any trouble getting a consensus on the winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is a standard menudo recipe for those who would like to
give it a try. It has been adjusted for use with canned hominy _
not the purist method, but the fastest.
</P>
<P>
   MENUDO
</P>
<P>
   Yields 10-12 cups
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 pounds honeycomb tripe cut into 1-by-1/2-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   2 pigs' feet
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup red chili powder
</P>
<P>
   2 cups drained hominy
</P>
<P>
   1 onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   3 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   Water to cover, about 3 quarts
</P>
<P>
   Accompaniments:
</P>
<P>
   Dried oregano leaves, crumbled
</P>
<P>
   Chopped onions
</P>
<P>
   Lime or lemon wedges
</P>
<P>
   Dried red chiles, crushed, or chopped jalapeno
</P>
<P>
   Flour or corn tortillas
</P>
<P>
   In a kettle, combine the tripe and the pigs' feet with 3 quarts
of water and salt. Bring water to a boil and simmer mixture,
covered, for 2 hours, or until the tripe is tender but still firm.
From time to time, skim froth from the soup.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the tripe to a bowl and set aside. Add the 1/4 cup
chili powder. Simmer the pigs' feet for 1 hour longer, or until
they are tender. Transfer them with a slotted spoon to another bowl
and let them cool until they can be handled.
</P>
<P>
   Discard the bones and cut meat into 1-inch pieces. Return the
tripe and the pigs' feet to the broth. Add the hominy, onion and
garlic and simmer the mixture, covered, for 30 minutes. Serve the
menudo with accompaniments for individual tastes.

<P>
   Pop open a bottle of Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale and find
yourself transported back in time to the little town of Tadcaster
in Yorkshire, England. Established in 1758, the Old Brewery
Tadcaster has been cranking out malty, well-rounded brews, from
stouts to pale ales, ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Nut Brown Ale is no exception. Deriving its name from the rich
color and slightly sweet, nutty flavor, this British ale is called
Old Brewery Strong Ale in Britain. They can call it whatever they
like: a rose by any other name ...
</P>
<P>
   At first blush during our tasting, this brew came off a touch
weak: good color, nice head, fresh bouquet. But the first few sips
revealed no complexity. Only as we let it rest for a few minutes
did the true essence reveal itself: a toasty yet sweet palate,
nicely rounded bitter finish with lingering malt on the tongue. And
once again, we encountered that most American habit of beer
ruination _ overchilling.
</P>
<P>
   Most domestic brews are pilsners, descended from brews made in
chilly areas such as Bohemia, where beer is naturally served very
cold. As a result, the inferior descendants, American mass-produced
beers, are served practically freezing because they are unpalatable
any other way, and intense cold also covers up their lack of
character.
</P>
<P>
   British beers, on the other hand, are best when served slightly
chilled. Again, consider the native climate of England. Samuel
Smith has been brewing for 241 years: There were no refrigerators
back then, just a cool cellar or a chilly stream to keep the stuff
fresh. But most taverns keep their imports at the same cryogenic
temperature as the American junk. Thus, most good Brit brews need
to defrost for a few minutes before sampling.
</P>
<P>
   OK.MDNM/, I'm finished ranting.
</P>
<P>
   Nut Brown Ale is widely available, thanks to a good marketing
plan from Seattle-based importer Merchant Du Vin. It's also a touch
more expensive than many imports currently gracing our neighborhood
booze barns. Quite honestly, I'm not sure it's worth it, what with
the availability of so many other fine brews at a buck or two less
per six-pack. On the other hand, it's a pretty cheap trip back in
time for a genuinely satisfying sip of history. Try one and see for
yourself..MDBO/.MDNM/

   Sink leaks can develop in two places. The obvious leaks occur on
top around the faucets. Remedies usually require opening the faucet
and adjusting or replacing the valve components. Leaks can also
occur under the sink in the drain pipes. These leaks sometimes go
unnoticed if the pipes are enclosed in a vanity or cabinet. They
are not as obvious as the faucet leaks because the pipes do not
hold water under constant pressure, so the drips are not constant.
Drain pipe leaks only drip when water is flowing out of the sink.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the leak can be corrected by tightening or replacing a
slip washer on one of the joints. Usually, however, the drips occur
because one of the pipes has corroded and is no longer watertight.
If one pipe is corroded, the others will soon deteriorate, so it is
best to replace the entire drain assembly. While this may sound
complicated, it is an easy repair that any do-it-yourselfer can
make. And it won't take more than a couple of hours.
</P>
<P>
   It is usually dark under the sink so you will probably have to
rig up work light. Make sure the light is plugged into a grounded
circuit, preferably a GFCI, because you will be working around
plumbing fixture that offer an excellent ground.
</P>
<P>
   Start by taking a Polaroid photo of the drain assembly. These
will show you how the pieces fit together and guide you when you
install the new pipes. If you do not own a Polaroid camera, make a
pencil sketch.
</P>
<P>
   You do not have to shut off the water for this repair, the only
water in the drain pipes is a small amount of standing water in the
trap. Start by placing a bucket under the drain trap. Use a pair of
water-pump pliers (also called '' channel locks'')to unscrew the
two slip nuts that hold the trap to the wall waste arm and the sink
tailpiece. Remove the trap and dump the water in it into the
bucket.
</P>
<P>
   Next disconnect and remove the other pipes, including the waste
wall arm. This is the horizontal pipe that connects with the
drain-waste pipes in the wall. Usually the pipes are joined
together with slip nuts. Some of the connections will have rubber
washers. You should replace all the fittings, including the rubber
washers, even if they look good.
</P>
<P>
   Take all the parts with you to the nearest hardware store or
home center. It is a good idea to place a sign on the sink so no
one uses it while you are at the store. When looking for
replacement parts, make sure the diameter of the new pipes matches
that of the old. Don't worry about the length; some of the new
pipes will be much longer. You can cut them to fit.
</P>
<P>
   Many home centers and hardware stores stock replacement drain
kits that contain all the parts you will need to replace the entire
drain assembly. These kits are usually cheaper than the total price
of the individual parts. You may also have a choice between metal
drain pipes or plastic ones. Both plastic and metal drain pipes are
equally durable, but most do-it-yourselfers find that the plastic
pipes are easier to work with.
</P>
<P>
   Using your Polaroid photo or sketch as guide, loosely connect
the new parts together. Mark the pieces that are too long and need
to be cut. Plastic pipes can be cut with almost any handsaw,
although a saw with a fine-tooth blade will produce a smoother cut.
Use a hacksaw with a medium- or fine-tooth blade to cut metal
pipes.
</P>
<P>
   It is not absolutely essential to cut the pipes square, but
square cuts make a neater job and will give a better fit when you
join the pipes together. You can use a miter box to get a square
cut, or you can wrap masking tape around the pipe. The tape's edge
will provide a guide for a straight cut.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble the pieces slide the slip nut, followed by the
washer, over the unthreaded end of the pipe. Examine the washer
carefully to see if it is tapered. If so, the taper should face
away from the slip nut. This is important, because if the washer is
incorrectly mounted it will not seal properly.
</P>
<P>
   Install the sink tailpiece first, then the wall waste arm. The
trap is the piece that allows you the most latitude for adjustment
_ you can move it up and down or back and forth as needed _ so
attach this part last.
</P>
<P>
   When all the pieces are in place, hand-tighten the slip nuts,
then run water through the drain. Check carefully for leaks. If a
joint does leak, tighten the slip nut another quarter turn. If it
still leaks, take it apart to make sure that the washer is properly
installed.
</P>

MORE MBA'S FOREGO HEFTY SALARIES TO START OWN BUSINESSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHARLES BOISSEAU   
 The Gainesville Sun   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ Earlier this month, Jon Lovoy graduated from
the University of Florida with a masters degree in business
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the hard part.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of going to work at an established consulting firm or
big corporation like most of his classmates, Lovoy is going to work
for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Lovoy has launched a business that records and sells compact
discs for high school and middle school bands. He operates a
one-employee company, named Da Capo CD Productions, from his
apartment in downtown Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrifying,'' Lovoy said. ``All my friends are getting
these jobs that are guaranteeing them a salary, and me I'm not
guaranteed anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Lovoy, 27, is among a small but increasing number of MBA
graduates who are giving up $60,000-a-year-or-more salaries to go
into business for themselves. These risk takers are attracted by
independence and emboldened by their newly acquired business
skills.
</P>
<P>
   Arnie Heggestad, the Holloway professor of entrepreneurship at
UF, said an increasing number of MBA students say they want to
eventually start their own business. Most, however, will first work
for a company for several years, which, among other things, allows
them to pay off any student loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they start something within five years of leaving we've had
a success,'' Heggestad said of those MBA students who specialize in
the college's entrepreneurial track.
</P>
<P>
   Other MBA schools also report their graduates are looking to go
out on their own as the explosion of the Internet has caught the
attention of would-be entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   A student poll of this year's 880 graduates of the Harvard
Business School found that 343 say they plan either to launch
high-tech start-ups or join the venture capital firms that support
them to cash in on the Internet boom, according to a student poll.
That's triple the number four years ago. Also, the number of
graduates taking traditional consulting and Wall Street jobs has
dropped by nearly half, to 308.
</P>
<P>
   Of UF's 140 MBA graduates this year, only a handful plan to go
directly into their own businesses, said Melanie Parker, director
of career services for the MBA program. Those opting to take a job
will earn an average of $62,000, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Wizeman and Chris Duvall are two UF grads jumping right
into business. They areare in the process of starting an
Alphagraphics franchise in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Wizeman said he had several employment offers, including one for
more than $100,000 from an investment banking firm in New York.
Instead, Wizeman, who already was a certified public accountant
before going to MBA school, decided to roll the dice.
</P>
<P>
   The pair have raised $400,000, mostly through bank loans and
personal savings, to pay a franchise fee, a downpayment on rent and
for printing, computer and other equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the nature of the person. There are a lot of people who
are very happy working for someone else, and they will go that
route,'' Wizeman said. ``But I just feel two things: One, I can do
better, and two, I will just enjoy it a whole lot more, the whole
building process.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinnie Whibbs III, who graduated with a MBA degree last year,
spent the past year helping set up a for-profit biomedical research
company in Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Whibbs launched LocalSensations.com Inc., a
Pensacola-based Web site to link travelers with offbeat
restaurants, hotels and other attractions in various cities. His
minority partner in the business, graduated this month but decided
to take a job at a new business unit of American Express in Fort
Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's in the genes,'' Whibbs said of going into his own
business. ``Everybody in my extended family works for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Lovoy, he started his CD-production company last year
while still in the MBA program. In April, he won first place in an
annual business plan contest among UF MBA students.
</P>
<P>
   Lovoy's business works like this: High schools and middle
schools send in audio tapes of their concerts and other
performances. Lovoy records the tapes onto CDs, designs the artwork
and pays any required royalties.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming year, Lovoy expects his sales to jump more than
five-fold from current annual sales of about $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the independence this provides,'' Lovoy said. ``While
right now I'm making less money than probably my colleagues,
starting, my potential of making more is greater.''

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I am going to pour a concrete slab for a patio outside the
back door to my home. I want this to be a rectangular shape with
perfectly square corners because I will be putting down a
foundation and eventually want to erect walls and a roof on this
concrete slab. When I set up the form boards, how can I be sure
that the corners will be perfectly square?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are several ways to do this but the simplest method is
measure across each of the diagonals as shown here. If all the
corners are perfectly square (each measuring 90 degrees) the two
measurements will be equal. If the diagonals do not measure the
same, then adjust or move the form boards until they are equal in
length. The same method can be used to check if a room is square,
or to square up a wood deck.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have a problem with condensation in our attic during the
cold winter months. Water forms on the rafters and drips down onto
the insulation, then it soaks through onto the ceiling below. The
building has louvered vents in the gable at each end of the attic
and these are always open. Do think more vents are needed?
</P>
<P>
   A: As a rule, good attic ventilation requires that there also be
adequate venting along the eaves at the bottom of the attic so that
air can flow in at the bottom and out at the top, therefore gable
vents alone may not be enough. For best results there should be
ridge vents along the peak, as well as continuous venting along the
eaves.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our house has cedar shingles on the outside and our builder
told us that this type of siding should need no stain. However, the
shingles are now faded and discolored looking and look as though
they should be stained. What do you think?
</P>
<P>
   A: Application of two coats of shingle stain is definitely
advisable _ for appearance sake, as well as for preserving the
shingles. This should normally be renewed every four to five years,
depending on weather and exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The gray grout in the tile joints of my ceramic tile kitchen
floor has been stained in a large area where some grease was
accidentally spilled _ and I like the darker look. I know I can
scrape out and replace this grout, but since I like the darker
look, is there any kind of stain I can use to stain or color the
rest of the grout to match this area?
</P>
<P>
   A: Any oil or sealer will darken the grout to some extent _ but
you cannot be sure this would match the grease-stained grout.
Unless you want to replace all of the grout, I would advise just
fixing up that one darker area by scraping out the old grout and
replacing it with new material to match the rest of the grout.
</P>
<P>

   Q. I've been trying to run Scan Disk on my C drive, but this
message appears: ``Scan disk has restarted 10 times because Windows
or another program has been writing to this drive. Quitting some
running programs may enable Scan Disk to finish sooner.'' I have no
other programs running and have even disabled the virus scan.
What's wrong?
</P>
<P>
   A. There are a few troubleshooting things to try when you get
this particular message in Windows 95 or 98. First, press Control,
Alt and Delete simultaneously to call up the Close Program dialog
box. If there are any programs on the list except for Explorer and
Systray, close them with the End Task button; do not close Explorer
and Systray.
</P>
<P>
   And make sure your screen saver is set to None. To do this,
right-click on the desktop area and select Properties from the
menu. Click on the Screen Saver tab, pick None from the pop-up list
and click OK.
</P>
<P>
   Try running Scan Disk again. If you still get the error message,
restart the computer in Safe Mode to disable temporarily any device
drivers that might be interfering. If you're using Windows 95,
press the F8 key when you see the ``Starting Windows 95'' message
and pick Safe Mode from the menu. If you use Windows 98, hold down
the Control key as the machine reboots and pick Safe Mode from the
Startup menu.
</P>
<P>
   If Scan Disk still won't run after that, restart the computer in
MS-DOS mode from the Shut Down menu. At the DOS prompt line, type
scandisk and press Enter.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How much Web server space does an average person need to make
a Web site?
</P>
<P>
   A. That depends on what the person wants to put on that Web
site. Web pages consist of files stored on a Web server. If the
site is to consist of just a few pages of text and small images,
for a personal family history page or a home-business
advertisement, for example, you could probably get by with just a
few megabytes of storage space. Many Internet service providers
offer their users about two megabytes or more of free space on
their servers for personal Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   You usually won't get your own domain name for the site with a
basic setup through your ISP. If you have grand designs for a site
with all the latest technology, like video and audio clips,
animation, tons of images and interactive material, you'll need
more server space to accommodate the larger files. Your provider
may also limit the number of hits your page can get per month.
</P>
<P>
   If you have bigger things in mind, you should try to rent server
space from a Web host company. Most of them have pricing plans that
will allow for more server space, traffic and even a domain name of
your choice for your site. To search for an appropriate Web host,
try looking at the Yellow Pages section of the Ultimate Web Host
List (webhostlist.internetlist.com). The Directory
(thedirectory.org) also offers a state-by-state list of ISP's and
Web hosts.  &QL; 
Circuits invites questions about computer-based technology, by
postal mail to Questions, Circuits, The New York Times, 229 West
43d Street, New York, N.Y. 10036-3959 or by e-mail to
Q&AMP;A(AT)nytimes.com.

   It was glorious spring day for baseball in Providence, R.I.,
last Saturday, in which the home team, the Providence College
Friars, was about to play the Villanova Wildcats. The well-occupied
metal bleachers sparkled under the noon sun; fans set up beach
chairs behind the screen and spread out blankets on the grass
beyond the left-field line; the dust from the tan infield had been
hosed down by some of the players themselves in their white
uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   The well-occupied metal bleachers sparkled under the noon sun;
fans had set up beach chairs behind the screen and spread out
blankets on the grass beyond the left-field line at Hendricken
Field. The dust from the tan infield had been hosed down by some of
the players themselves in their white uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   So why the sadness? Why the anger? Why the passion? And where
was Father Smith?
</P>
<P>
   ``After what happened,'' said Barry Sullivan, an all-American
baseball player for Providence in the 1970s, referring to the
college president, ``you'd think he'd have the guts to show his
face.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the 78th season of Providence College baseball, making
it the school's oldest athletic team.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the Friars are rated best in the Northeast and 26th
in the nation in a poll of coaches. They came into Saturday's game
with a 42-13 record, two victories short of the school record, and
were assured of being seeded in the Big East tournament, which
begins Wednesday in Trenton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the best baseball seasons in school history, and it
will be its last.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the Rev. Philip A. Smith, the school president,
announced that baseball, along with men's golf and tennis, would be
eliminated from the varsity athletic program. He said the cuts were
made in order to comply with gender equity and proportionality
strictures set down by the National Collegiate Athletic
Association, driven by the Federal Office of Civil Rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still so upset that I can hardly express it,'' said Angelo
Ciminiello, the senior third baseman, an academic all-American for
four years who will soon be going to medical school.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the announcement was made, three players
transferred to other schools. But the rest of the team decided to
stay, to play, perhaps with a commitment that they never had
before. At one stage, they won a school-record 15 straight games.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game against Villanova, each player and coach was
introduced, their team contributions briefly noted by a young
announcer on the crackling p.a. system. The team heard and saw the
fans standing and clapping for this last home game. ``It was so
emotional,'' Mike Scott, the freshman right-fielder, said later.
``I had tingles all up and down my body.''
</P>
<P>
   The Friars fell behind by 1-0 in the fourth, tied the score in
the bottom of the inning, only to fall behind in the fifth, 2-1.
Again, they mounted a rally in the bottom half of the inning and
took a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing what this team has done,'' said Lou Merloni, a
former Providence infielder who was with the Boston Red Sox early
this season, before having been sent to the Pawtucket farm team the
other day. He had come to lend his support on this last home game.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's so sad. I feel like something has been ripped out of
my insides. But this team has never quit, even when the school quit
on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith sees his decision differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not feel good about the decision to drop baseball, but in
the end we had to have our academic priorities come first,'' he
said on Monday. ``We tried other ways, but nothing else worked. It
seemed we'd be taking from Peter to pay Paul, and still falling
short. Ultimately I had to make this unfortunate decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The baseball team also has the support of female athletes at
Providence, who were angered by the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the announcement was made about eliminating baseball, the
women athletes were as mad about it as anyone else,'' said Michelle
Hackmer, a junior on the swimming team, who attended the game.
``Sure, we want women athletes to be treated fairly, but at this
expense? I don't think this is what Title IX was supposed to be
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day after the announcement, the women's volleyball team
had a game at home, and threatened to boycott the game. They
didn't, but to show their support to the men they warmed up in the
baseball team's jerseys.''
</P>
<P>
   The Women's Sports Foundation has issued a position paper on
Title IX and the elimination of men's varsity sports in that
regard. ``Most schools cite, as the reason for their decision, the
need to reduce expenditures in order to provide opportunities for
women,'' it reads. ``Title IX requires no such reduction in
opportunities for men. The Foundation is not in favor of reducing
athletic opportunities for men as the preferred method of achieving
Title IX compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Enrollment at Providence is 59 percent women, and 41 percent
men. But 57 percent of the athletes are men, with the men receiving
the majority of athletic scholarships. At Providence, there will
soon be 11 women's varsity teams to go along with 9 men's varsity
teams. The NCAA insisted on 1 percent gender equity
proportionality, meaning that the percentage of female students and
the money spent on their sports must be within 1 per cent of each
other. Participation of women in sports continues to trail
enrollment rates of women at many colleges, according to The
Chronicle of Higher Education. Nationally, women constitute 53
percent of the undergraduates on Division I campuses, but only 40
percent of their athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Terence J. Keegan, the school's executive vice
president and designated spokesman, said Providence was fearful of
dragging on Title IX compliance, especially after Brown, the Ivy
League school across town, fought it in court and lost the case,
which cost the school almost $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just couldn't risk that kind of litigation,'' said Keegan,
who met with reporters on Saturday, away from the field. ``We felt
we were backed into a corner.''
</P>
<P>
   As the game at Hendricken Field continued, Smith was noticeably
absent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had commencement exercises the following day,'' Smith later
said. ``I had three speaking engagements on Saturday, and didn't
have a minute's time for anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Keegan had offered this explanation: ``He was
advised that it might be a hostile environment. And we wanted this
day and this team not to be mired in ugliness but to go out in a
blaze of glory. They deserve that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the game now, the Friars went ahead by 7-3, with Ciminiello
leading the attack with a home run and first baseman Mike O'Keefe
adding three hits. In the bottom of the ninth, Villanova scored one
run and had runners on first and third with one out.
</P>
<P>
   The fans were standing, quiet with expectation. Villanova's Pat
King hit a high chopper to Ciminiello at third.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an easy ball,'' recalled Ciminiello, ``but my thought
was, `God, just make a good throw to second.'' He did, to start a
double play and end the game. Friends and family and parents
streamed onto the field, hugging each other and crying. ``There
wasn't a dry eye among us,'' Ciminiello said later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it here,'' said Scott, the right fielder, who went 2
for 5 in the game, and leads the nation with 105 hits. ``I love the
school. I love the guys. We're a family. I wish I didn't have to
leave.'' But he wants to play college baseball, and he has accepted
a partial scholarship to the University of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strangely enough,'' said Ciminiello, ``the school's decision
has been the ultimate motivation for us. We're looking forward to
the Big East tournament. And then, we hope, the NCAA regionals.''
</P>
<P>
   The Friars' coach, Charlie Hickey, was milling around the field,
congratulating people, being congratulated. ``This was a special
day,'' he said. ``This will be a year that none of us will ever
forget.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, evenly, about Title IX: ``It wasn't meant to have this
kind of negative impact. We all want fairness. There just has to be
another way.''
</P>
<P>
   The sun had sunk behind trees, and players and fans and family,
talking softly, began to drift out of Hendricken Field, for the
last time.

EVERYONE NEEDS AN EXTENDED FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Thursday, May 27) 
(DW) 
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For decades, author Kurt Vonnegut Jr., 76, has viewed having an
extended family as the antidote to much of what ails us _ a safety
net in a sometimes cold and capricious world.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1976 book ``Slapstick,'' Vonnegut proposed the idea that
everyone should be assigned one of a fixed number of middle names,
and everyone else in the world who shared that name would
immediately become their family, with the resulting joys and
obligations.
</P>
<P>
   When Vonnegut gave the commencement address last Saturday to the
134 new graduates of the Class of 1999 at Agnes Scott College in
Decatur, Ga., the author elaborated on this familiar theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met a man in Nigeria one time, an Ibo who had 600 relatives
he knew quite well. His wife had just had a baby, the best possible
news in any extended family. They were going to take that kid to
meet all its relatives, Ibos of all ages and sizes and shapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would even meet other babies, cousins not much older than
it was. Everybody who was big enough and steady enough was going to
get to hold it, to cuddle it, to gurgle to it, and say how pretty
it was, or how handsome. Wouldn't you have loved to be that baby?''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Vonnegut proposed, the reason there are so many people
getting divorced these days also stems from the lack of extended
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freud said he didn't know what women want. They want a whole
lot of people to talk to. What do they want to talk about? They
want to talk about everything. What do men want? They want a lot of
pals, and they wish people wouldn't get so mad at them all the
time. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that when a man and woman got married, the bride
got a lot more people to talk to about everything. The groom got a
whole lot more pals to tell dumb jokes to. A few Americans, but
very few, still have extended families. The Navajos. The Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   ``But most of us, if we get married nowadays, are just one more
person for the other person. The groom gets one more pal, but it's
a woman. The woman gets one more person to talk to about
everything, but it's a man. When a couple has an argument nowadays,
they may think it's about money, or sex, or power, or how to raise
the kids, or whatever. What they're really saying to each other,
though, is: `You're not enough people!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Vonnegut, as is his way, crammed a lot of life's big issues into
one little speech. He talked about technology and dental floss and
CNN. He told people not to give up on books, ``their friendly heft,
the sweet reluctance of their pages when you turn them with your
sensitive fingertips.''
</P>
<P>
   He talked about Colorado and Kosovo and how revenge begets
revenge, which begets revenge, forming ``an endless chain of human
misery.''
</P>
<P>
   And he talked about how woefully insufficient computers are at
providing people with what they need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't try to make yourself an extended family out of ghosts on
the Internet,'' Vonnegut said, with his characteristic smirk. ``Get
yourself a Harley, and join Hell's Angels instead.''

HEALTH CARE EXPERT SEES RISING INSURANCE RATES CUTTING BENEFITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As health insurance rates keep rising, workers'
benefits are sure to suffer, a health care expert says.
</P>
<P>
   The assertion came in the wake of a vote Tuesday by the
California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) to allow
health maintenance organizations to raise rates for its members by
an average of 9.7 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   CalPERS members are state and local government agencies that
represent some 1 million employees and their dependents.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Boland, a health care consultant in Berkeley, Calif., said
the rate increases granted to several HMOs _ including an 11.7
percent rate increase for Oakland-based Kaiser Permanente _
``threatens the integrity of (workers') overall compensation
packages. ... A premium increase basically affects everyone:
employer, employee and dependents. This is bad news for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Boland said employers won't be able to absorb the additional
costs and will need to pass them along to workers. However, he
said, employers will do this at their discretion.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Boland said, employers will need to ``raise (health
care plan) co-pays and deductibles or cut back on other benefits
like raises and overtime. It's going to come out of the employees'
pocket, directly or indirectly.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Kaiser, which is CalPERS' biggest contractor,
Foundation Health Systems Inc. will be allowed to raise rates 9.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   CalPERS let Kaiser raise rates by 10.75 percent for this year,
after refusing its original request for a 12 percent increase.
Foundation raised its rates with CalPERS for this year by 5.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The vote Tuesday by the health benefits committee of CalPERS,
the second largest public buyer of health insurance in the United
States after the federal government, also affects insurers such as
PacifiCare Health Systems Inc., Aetna Inc. and Cigna Corp.
</P>
<P>
   CalPERS, whose premiums rose an average of 7.3 percent this
year, is the first big purchaser of health benefits to set premiums
for next year.
</P>
<P>
   The increases for the year 2000 are the biggest for CalPERS
members since 1991, when premiums rose an average of 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, premiums have dropped in five of the past eight
years. The latest increase will return most premiums to
approximately the 1991 level.
</P>
<P>
   CalPERS said rising medical costs justified substantially
increasing rates for the second year in a row. According to Sheryl
Skolnick, a BancBoston Robertson Stephens health care analyst,
overall U.S. medical costs are expected to increase by about 4
percent to 6 percent this year and another 4 percent to 6 percent
in the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``This level of premium increase is necessary to adequately fund
our members' health care in 2000,'' said Margaret Stanley, CalPERS'
health benefits administrator, in her recommendation to the CalPERS
health benefit committee.
</P>
<P>
   Skolnick said, however, that large employers who negotiate their
2000 rates later in this year may be more resistant than CalPERS to
big premium increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``(If insurers) have as good a year as they seem to be having, I
think their employer customers are going to be looking at their
profit margins and saying, `I want some of my money back, thank
you,''' said Skolnick.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs are a form of health insurance in which insurers limit
their coverage of the cost for doctors, hospitals and procedures.
</P>
<P>
   CalPERS said rates for its self-funded, preferred-provider
organizations, another form of restricted health insurance, will go
up about 7 percent in 2000.

A BACKWATER THAT INSPIRED ART  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 23) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tiny Breton village of Pont-Aven, now synonymous with the
post-Impressionist school of French painting that formed around
Paul Gauguin before he left for Tahiti, might have remained obscure
if not for the tides.
</P>
<P>
   Tides in this part of Brittany are nearly as extreme as they are
in the Bay of Fundy. A century ago, ships that came into the harbor
at flood found themselves high and dry at low tide. As a result,
the sailors who brought wine and other goods and then loaded up
with flour from the mills near the Aven River needed cheap hotels
and boarding houses to stay in while they waited for the waters to
raise their schooners.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the 1860s, those hotels and boarding houses, run by
shrewd businesswomen, began to attract artists in search of rustic
country and colorful Breton costumes. Americans were the first to
come, such painters as Robert Wylie, whose ``Fortune-Teller of
Brittany'' is at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Others like him, whose names mean little today _ Thomas Hovenden
and William Picknell, for instance _ went back and told friends in
Paris, 350 miles away, about what they had found at Pont-Aven.
</P>
<P>
   One of the French artists who went, Felix Jobbe-Duval, wrote
Gauguin in 1886 with these words: ``It's a little backwater, and
cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheap was the operative word, and Gauguin, struggling and
penniless in Paris, lost no time in coming. Indeed, it cost him
practically nothing to live in the little boarding house where
Marie-Jeanne Gloanec had put up some of those American artists next
to the stone bridge over the river that gave the town its name.
</P>
<P>
   Gauguin found inspiration in the Bois d'Amour, a wood along the
meandering banks of the Aven, the rows of whitewashed stone
cottages with slate roofs, the rugged granite churches in nearby
villages and the suffused light that seems to be reflected from the
sea, a riverbend away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work hard here, and with success,'' Gauguin wrote to his
wife, Mette Gad, shortly after he arrived. ``I am respected as the
best painter in Pont-Aven; true, that doesn't bring in a penny
more. But perhaps it will help in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   What Gauguin developed in Pont-Aven (``Pon-tahVENN,'' as Bretons
pronounce it) was a style that changed the history of French art
after fellow artists like Emile Bernard and Paul Serusier joined
him.
</P>
<P>
   Today people flock to the village, halfway between Lorient and
Quimper, vastly outnumbering the 3,000 natives, from mid-July to
the end of August, and on weekends all year round.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, Heidi, and I first came on a hot July day a year ago to
see the excellent Pont-Aven Museum nestled next to the town hall, a
building that was once a hotel annex run by Marie-Jeanne Gloanec's
biggest competitor, Julia Guillou.
</P>
<P>
   We returned after the tourist crowds were gone in early
September to explore the museum and the village at greater leisure,
staying in one of the five rooms at the rustic but comfortable
Moulin de Rosmadec. Its restaurant, housed separately in the actual
mill, is also the best in town, with a Michelin star.
</P>
<P>
   Our room on the ground floor, on a narrow lane called the
Venelle de Rosmadec reached from the main square, was more like a
suite, with a spare sitting room with white modern tile floors and
country Breton furniture in dark wood. The small bedroom (with a
little space to spare and a double bed) was a bit dark because the
shutters wouldn't open. A picture of Franck Sebilleau, the owners'
son, taken before he and his brother Frederic took over the kitchen
from their father, Pierre, hung on the bathroom wall.
</P>
<P>
   Down the lane past a well, the restaurant is a converted
15th-century mill, a two-story granite structure on a narrow island
between the millraces that used to channel the river to the water
wheel. The dining room is a warm place with Breton ladder-backed
chairs, a huge fireplace with a wild boar mounted over the mantle,
and lead-paneled windows opening out onto the rushing river.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen is even bigger than the restaurant, which seats
about 50. In it we found Franck, 28, and Frederic, 34, getting
ready for dinner. Their grilled Rosmadec lobster, its dark-red
shell redolent of butter and lightly salted, with two sauces served
on the side, one tasting of lemon butter and the other of herbs,
was memorable.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder, with the ocean a few miles away. Pierre Sebilleau
gets the restaurant's oysters from the little port of Belon, down
the coast, source of France's most renowned oysters. Later we had a
dozen Belon No. 3's for lunch with a half-bottle of Muscadet at the
Bar La Cabane in the small town; the bill was just over $20.
</P>
<P>
   But we had come for the paintings and the museum, which was
closed over lunch. It was built in a modern style by a local
architect in 1986, a hundred years after Gauguin's first visit,
with considerable support from the pre-eminent collector of art of
the Pont-Aven School, Samuel Josefowitz, an American citizen who
lives in Switzerland and England.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When we visited, the museum's two floors (roughly 1,800 square
feet) were largely given over to an exhibition of paintings by
Georges Lacombe, one of the Nabis, as Serusier called those
inspired by Gauguin's work in Pont-Aven, borrowing the Hebrew word
for prophet or seer.
</P>
<P>
   The Pont-Aven School was multinational, with Irish, Dutch and
German as well as French artists, and the village also inspired
many American painters. At the museum, until June 21, Roderic
O'Conor, an Irish painter attracted to Pont-Aven when Gauguin was
there, holds center stage with engravings, and from June 26 to
Sept. 27, works by other Irish artists join his paintings.
</P>
<P>
   There is a 10-minute slide show to orient visitors and place the
town in the context of the art produced here. The small permanent
collection includes photographs and manuscripts from the extensive
documentation center, with pictures of Marie-Jeanne Gloanec and
Julia Guillou and their famous customers, and explanations of what
work the artists did here.
</P>
<P>
   In Pont-Aven the artists of the school developed and refined the
style of broad swatches of pure color separated by heavy dark
outlines recalling the lead joints in medieval stained-glass
windows, leaving faces and other elements abstract rather than
realistically detailed.
</P>
<P>
   Painting, Gauguin thought, should have ``the right to dare
everything,'' and while there are only a handful of his works in
the collection _ ``Le Sabotier'' is the only oil painting _ there
are enough to give an idea of where this art was heading.
</P>
<P>
   Later paintings by others like Emile Jourdan, whose 1926
painting ``Larnot Chapel in Moonlight'' hangs here, show how long
the influence of the Pont-Aven School lasted.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the museum, just to the left before the main square, we
saw one reason why artists of that era kept coming _ the annex that
Julia Guillou built across the street from her hotel to cater to
them, now the town hall. ``Annex'' indeed; it is about the size of
a four-story public school, and on the fourth floor our guide
Annaig Kerlan pointed out the enormous windows Madame Guillou
installed for the huge studios, four of them, built into the place.
</P>
<P>
   Madame Guillou, who died in 1927, was not alone. Opposite Madame
Gloanec's former pension on the Place Paul Gauguin, above the
Galerie La Belle Angele, you can see where other ambitious
landlords and landladies enlarged dormer windows, the better for
painters to work.
</P>
<P>
   Annaig, who conducts short guided tours for the town tourist
office on the square, showed us how to walk to the Bois d'Amour on
the banks of the Aven, where Serusier painted his ``Talisman''
under Gauguin's direction. This abstract impression of the small
glade is considered the first Nabi work.
</P>
<P>
   ``That tree, how does it look to you? It's green, isn't it?
Paint it green, then, the finest green on your palette,'' Gauguin
is said to have told him. ``And this shadow, rather blue? Don't be
afraid to paint it as blue as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   This ``Lesson of the Bois d'Amour,'' as the painter Maurice
Denis recounted it, is the name of a pedestrian itinerary. We found
it on the way down from the Chapel of Tremalo, a steep walk of more
than half a mile into oak forest and cornfields to a weather-beaten
granite Gothic church.
</P>
<P>
   Here Gauguin found the 17th-century polychromed crucifix
depicted in his 1889 work ``The Yellow Christ'' (now in the
Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, N.Y.) and a self-portrait (in
the Musee d'Orsay in Paris). The crucifix still hangs in the
chapel, which has been considerably restored.
</P>
<P>
   When we came back down into town, we were ready for a snack
before tackling the art galleries. Galettes de Pont-Aven,
irresistibly rich butter cookies, were originally made here from
flour produced by the mills. Two companies, Traou Mad and Penven,
dominate the trade today, packaging the cookies in tins decorated
with paintings that they sell in inviting outlets on the main
square and down the Rue du Port near the little harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Besides galettes in various shapes and sizes, we found the
kouign-amann (pronounced quinn-amen) cakes at the Boulangerie
Kersale, next to the Cafe des Arts on the main square, lived up to
their legendary reputation. A pizza-sized confection of sweet dough
baked with salted butter and topped with sugar crystals, it's best
sampled over coffee or tea in the back room of the boulangerie, or
perhaps with a glass of pommeau, a blend of apple juice and
Calvados.
</P>
<P>
   The galleries start just past the boulangerie. Paintings by
artists from the generation that came after Gauguin and Bernard and
painted here can often be found in the Galerie de la Poste, 10, Rue
General de Gaulle, and in the Galerie l'Atelier d'Ernest, 11 rue
Louis Lomenech.
</P>
<P>
   Pont-Aven is not just about the past, however. Caroline
Boyle-Turner, an art historian and Gauguin specialist, has been
running a summer program for young artists here called the
Pont-Aven School of Art, with credits transferable from the Rhode
Island School of Design in Providence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 70 students this year, and we've just bought the
Gloanec boarding house,'' she said. So the tradition begun by
Americans continues. A few never leave. Wylie is buried in the
Guillou family plot in the Pont-Aven cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to exploring the town, we made two enjoyable short
excursions; they can be done by car or bicycle. In the village of
Nizon, in the direction of Concarneau about two miles outside of
Pont-Aven, is the Romanesque Calvary or crucifixion monument that
Gauguin depicted in his ``Green Christ,'' which hangs in the Royal
Museum in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   About 15 miles away, in the coastal town of Le Pouldu, is a
reconstruction of the seaside boarding house run by Marie Henry,
the Buvette de la Plage. The steep cliffs and sand dunes are a
different world from the picture-perfect streets of Pont-Aven, and
Gauguin, Serusier, Meyer de Haan and Armand Seguin came here for a
change of scene in the summer of 1889.
</P>
<P>
   As the weather was bad and Marie Henry's company stimulating,
they stayed for weeks and decorated the walls and door panels of
the tiny dining room with their paintings.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Gauguin and his fellow artists couldn't sell any of
their works, so couldn't even pay the pittance for room and board
in Brittany. Marie Henry kept small paintings and sketches from her
boarders in lieu of payment.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly grateful, Gauguin sued but failed to get some of his work
back in 1894. His landlady took even the door panels with her when
she finally closed shop, and the house was eventually remodeled and
altered beyond recognition.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, on the anniversary of Gauguin's arrival, the village of
Le Pouldu recreated the original _ which now constitutes the
left-hand side of Cafe de la Plage, 30 feet away _ with
reproductions and some authentic paintings by the famous
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   So, once again, the dining room looks as it must have a century
ago _ about the size of a child's bedroom and filled with tiny
wooden tables and scenes painted directly on the walls, doors and
even the window panes by the artists.
</P>
<P>
   There are also reproductions of such familiar originals as
Gauguin's 1889 portrait of himself with a halo, now in the National
Gallery in Washington. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Getting There
</P>
<P>
   High-speed trains (TGVs) from Montparnasse Station in Paris take
about four hours to Lorient ($130 round trip, based on 6 francs to
the dollar), or Quimper ($142). Avis and Europcar have offices in
the Lorient station, Avis and Hertz at Quimper. The drive to
Pont-Aven takes about half an hour from either city. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Where to Stay
</P>
<P>
   Hotel Manoir de Kertalg, (33-2) 98.39.77.77, fax (33-2)
98.39.72.07, a 10-minute drive from Pont-Aven in Moelan-sur-Mer,
has nine rooms and a duplex apartment in a 20th-century manor on
the grounds of a 15th-century chateau occupied by the hotel's
owners. No restaurant. Continental breakfast, $10. The rooms,
carpeted with antique-reproduction furnishings and modern tiled
bathrooms, color television, and direct-dial telephones, looked
comfortable and cost $82 to $163; the apartment, $200. Open Easter

   Consider the Internet service provider. Depending on your online
habits, it can be the home of your familial interactions, the
envelope for your business memorandums, the conduit of your deepest
desires. It can get about as much intimate use as the lenses of
your glasses or the pages of a journal. It is the choice of a way
to view Web pages and to send e-mail, and as such it should not be
approached without proper introspection and circumspection.
</P>
<P>
   Or should it? For many Internet users, new and seasoned, that
choice depends on what start-up disk appears in a mailbox or cereal
box on any given day, which provider an employer chooses or which
program for an Internet service provider, commonly called an ISP,
shows up on a new desktop computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the correspondence we've received, and its emotional
content, choosing an ISP seems to rank somewhere between selecting
a long-distance phone service and choosing a caterer for a bar
mitzvah,'' Dr. Dawn McGatney, a Maryland pediatrician and
Webmaster, said via e-mail. Dr. McGatney runs a site called
Compleat Guide to an ISP You'll Enjoy Using (dogwolf.seagull
.net/isp.html). ``But we hear from many folks who are now on their
fifth or higher ISP,'' she added. ``Once you switch one to two
times, it's obviously easier. There is a bit of fear of the unknown
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Millions of people have decided they would rather switch
providers than fight suboptimal service. As of January, 36.7
percent of home Internet users had changed their ISP's at some
point and lived to tell about it, according to the Strategis Group,
a Washington-based research company that studies patterns in
telecommunications use. It's not an easy decision, but taking that
step can be liberating, people who love their new Internet services
say.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the choice is formidable, with 4,500 Internet
services available across the country. According to Forrester
Research, America Online has 39.4 percent of all home accounts; its
17 million subscribers worldwide are a group larger than the
combined daily circulation of the top 20 daily newspapers. Other
large services, like AT&AMP;T, Earthlink, MSN and Prodigy, collectively
share 15.3 percent of the market, while small ISPs _ those with
less than 2 percent of the market, like Sprint, Erols and the local
Bell telephone companies _ serve 41.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Internet services compete fiercely for new Internet users and
for people who have been online for years.
</P>
<P>
   AOL is the 800-pound gorilla in the middle of the information
superhighway and the new user's magnet. Its simple-to-install
software and ubiquitous distribution are the keys to its success.
Andrew Shepherd, a Forrester Research analyst, said that as of
January, AOL had captured 54 percent of all users who had been
online for less than six months and half of all users who had been
online for less than a year. It has also garnered its share of
criticism, as have other large and small ISP.s, for slow service,
busy signals, the prevalence of spam and concerns about members'
privacy. But Kathy McKiernan, an AOL spokeswoman, said that the
company was experiencing its fastest growth and lowest turnover
rate ever.
</P>
<P>
   Another service provider, Earthlink Network, based in Pasadena,
Calif., is competing for customers by, among other things,
marketing its Get Out of AOL Free plan and offering promotions like
a free month of service or free setup. Earthlink can transfer
Favorite Places Web sites from AOL to a new browser and will send
e-mail to everyone in a new customer's electronic address book to
notify them of the change of address.
</P>
<P>
   Taking cues from AOL, Earthlink has created easy-to-use software
that features a friendly on-screen guide. ``She'll say: `Hi,
welcome to Earthlink. I'll walk you through step by step. Click
here,' but you can also shut her up,'' said a company spokeswoman,
Kirsten Kappos.
</P>
<P>
   Other Internet providers, particularly smaller ones, win new
subscribers in more personal ways. Paul Budlong of Seattle, for
example, chose his small ISP, based in Seattle, after receiving
e-mail from someone who used it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked the name,'' he said of Drizzle.com, and found it
appropriate to local weather conditions. He switched from a
provider in Portland, Ore., to Drizzle, which serves the Puget
Sound region. He was frustrated by his old service's busy signals
(it could take up to 20 attempts to get through) and ``complete
technomorons at tech support who were incapable of speaking plain
English.'' He found the smaller local provider to be more helpful.
</P>
<P>
   ``They e-mail back, they call back, they explain things in
simple terms, they're friendly, on the ball and very patient,''
said Budlong, who has an old 386 computer with software that could
best be described as quaint. The support staff even downloaded a
huge program for him that would have taken him hours to do online.
``I went downtown, knocked on the door, and they didn't even charge
me for the disks,'' he said. ``It was very cool.''
</P>
<P>
   But the smaller ISPs are particularly vulnerable to mergers and
acquisitions, so they are less likely to remain stable.
</P>
<P>
   People who find an ISP they like might hesitate to rave about it
because that might encourage others to join and lead to busy
signals all over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a friend who wouldn't tell anybody when he'd find an ISP
he liked,'' said David Cassel, editor of the AOL Watch newsletter,
which is distributed to an e-mail list of 42,000 readers. ``You
really want a small service no one has ever heard about.''

</P>
<P>
   The search for the perfect fit can be traumatic. While any other
company that hung up on customers several times a day could expect
a quick pink slip, an ISP is harder to dump. Switching providers
could mean forfeiting prepaid Internet service, spending hours
rejiggering modem strings and software interfaces, losing old
e-mail messages and printing new business cards and resumes with
the new e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 reason that folks stick with an ISP that they hate _
and they can get truly emotional on the subject _ is that they've
prepaid a year or two in advance and stand to lose hundreds of
dollars by leaving,'' Dr. McGatney said. ``The trick here is always
to read the ISP's terms of service before subscribing. Be sure that
the ISP offers a prorated refund for those who cancel early. The
No. 2 reason would be the pain of notifying all your friends that
you have a new e-mail address, though many ISPs will forward your
e-mail forever at no charge.'' Mail sent to a closed AOL account,
she said, bounces back with a note that the mail could not be
delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Catlett, president of Junkbusters Corp., an online privacy
advocacy group in Green Brook, N.J., said switching often required
reconfiguring the user's computer. ``That's probably a traumatic
experience for many people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Sherman, a Web search guide at the Mining Co. site, said
some Internet patterns were hard to break. His parents started out
with AOL and resisted a move to Mindspring, he said. ``Even though
Mindspring is so easy, they were comfortable with AOL,'' he said.
``It's an inertia issue more than a branding issue.''
</P>
<P>
   When choosing a provider, a computer user should decide whether
one goal is to get broad-bandwidth Internet access, which allows
Internet connections at speeds faster than the current standard
consumer maximum, 56 kilobits per second on a conventional
telephone line. These faster access routes to the Internet have
many advantages: they can be open as long as the computer is on,
there is no waiting for dial tones, and there is little waiting for
Web sites to load.
</P>
<P>
   Internet service through a cable TV provider, which is available
in some places, can typically download one megabyte of data in less
than 8 seconds, compared with digital subscriber lines, or DSL
lines, at 15 seconds or a fast telephone modem, operating at 56K,
at two and a half minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Cable Internet service connects a house through the same wires
that carry cable television, with, in most cases, the cable company
acting as the Internet provider. DSL connects a computer to the Net
through existing phone lines but the computer must be within a
limited distance _ a few miles _ of a phone company switching
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can pretty much count on the fact that the larger ISPs are
in heavy-duty competition to roll out high-speed access,'' Sherman
said. ``The question is just when.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other questions are worth pondering: Where and how much?
Cable companies can now reach only about 23 million households.
Their Internet service costs about $40 per month, said David
Eiswert at the Strategis Group. DSL lines are available to about 6
million households for about $50 a month, compared with a cost of
about $20 a month for traditional dial-up services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is concerned about price,'' said Shepherd, of
Forrester Research. ``That's in some ways going to be one of the
things that allows dial-up ISPs to really fight off cable in the
short term. They're providing service at half the cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people decide not to pay for any ISP and rely on free Web
services instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can take half-steps _ get a Geocities Web page and Juno
e-mail account and access the Web through a machine at work or the
local public library if they don't want dial-up service,'' said
Cassel, of AOL Watch. Juno, Hotmail and Alta Vista mail are
examples of free e-mail services that a user can log onto from a
computer at a public library or Internet cafe. Free Web pages are
available at sites like Geocities and Tripod.
</P>
<P>
   Many Web surfers, however, want Web access from home. Some
choose their ISPs based on particular needs _ a frequent traveler
might want to have access to the Internet service while overseas,
for example, or a biology buff might need a large space on the Web
to hold a special page on the naked mole rat. Other customers
choose a service like AOL because it provides something like a
roped-off section of the larger Internet for children.
</P>
<P>
   There can be some advantages in switching providers early and
often.
</P>
<P>
   ``Changing your e-mail address periodically and auto-notifying
the sender to the old address with a message is a great way to get
off of every spam list in the world,'' Dr. McGatney said. ``Each
time we've moved, our junk mail dropped to zero for the next
several months.''

</P>
<P>
   ``We picked a local service provider based on price, service,
tech support, dial-ups and personalized service, not necessarily in
that order, mind you. We were with a local company. One of the
partners, whom we started with, split and formed his own ISP called
Maikai.net (www.maikai.net). So now we're with them. Because I know
the service will remain excellent! We've found that the larger ISPs
are of little or no help when they're done setting you up with a
DNS.''

<P>
   ``At the time I started using ISDN, Eclipse Internet was the
only ISP with ISDN-capable modems in my local calling area. Now
many others do, but I haven't bothered to shop around. Also, I like
the fact that they're comparatively small because of the rumors
that some of the big national ISPs are considering deals where they
sell details of their customers' surfing activities to
advertisers.''

<P>
   Co-founder of ISP-Check (www.ispcheck.com), which helps computer
users find ISPs and Web page hosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was with Bell Atlantic for a long time. They claim they
support 56K, but I was always connecting at 28, and there were busy
signals on weekends and evenings. I'd get kicked off every five
minutes. I switched to Starpower, which is good. It was really
easy. Most ISPs can set you up the same day or the same minute when
they have you on the phone.''

<P>
   Poet, whose ninth book, ``The Dream of the Marsh Wren, Writing

</P>
<P>
   ``There was an article in a computer magazine that gave
Mindspring a very high rating. I couldn't always make connections
reliably on Compuserve so I switched to Mindspring because of its
rating and because I wanted service for a Web site. I've been with
Mindspring several years now and am satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN AN ISP
</P>
<P>
   Whether you are finding your very first Internet service
provider or looking for the perfect one after seven false starts,
choosing an ISP is challenging. Here are some questions to ask when
shopping around:
</P>
<P>
   HOW COMMITTED DO I HAVE TO BE? Extra points go to providers
offering trial memberships. Beware of those that tie you down to
years of service if you want a good rate. Find out if you can get
money back if you switch later.
</P>
<P>
   CAN I GET CONNECTED? Try dialing the phone numbers of a
prospective ISP during peak times and make sure you hear a modem
screech (good) instead of a busy signal (very bad). Ask about the
service's user-to-modem ratio, and find out if there are any
guarantees about how easy it will be to connect to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   WILL MY ISP KEEP UP WITH TECHNOLOGY? Find out if your
prospective provider plans to offer broad-band technology like DSL
for speedier access to the Internet. If you are particularly fond
of playing games, shopping or trading stock online, make sure that
the service has sufficient bandwidth to accommodate those
activities easily. Talk to customer service or sales
representatives to see if the provider has partners for DSL service
in your area or plans such partnerships. Or find out whether you
could continue with the provider if you got a cable Internet
connection; some ISPs offer discounts on access for people gaining
access to the Net through cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   IS THE PRICE RIGHT? If you don't choose unlimited access, make
sure you can afford the often-steep hourly rates if you exceed your
monthly minimum. You should find out if the provider has hefty
setup fees.
</P>
<P>
   IS THERE FREE, 24-HOUR TECH SUPPORT? You will most likely need
it. To check out customer satisfaction with a provider, talk to
other people who use it. If you can't find someone offline, try
searching newsgroups online for comments from the Web world at
large.
</P>
<P>
   IS ACCESS AVAILABLE ON THE ROAD? If you need access while
traveling, your provider should have a wide range of local numbers
in the areas you tend to visit or offer 800 numbers. If you decide
on cable or DSL service, make sure that you can connect in other
cities through your provider when you are limited to a phone line
on the road. With Web TV, you have to take along your box unit to
get on line from the road.
</P>
<P>
   WILL I HAVE PRIVACY ON THIS ISP? You should ask if the ISP will
sell your name to marketers or bombard you with spam. It is also
wise to find out if you can post what you want on your Web page,
including commercial material, if applicable.
</P>
<P>
   They say that breaking up is hard to do, but there are ways to
soften the separation anxiety when changing ISPs. ``Don't get
wedded to your ISP,'' said Jason Catlett, president of Junkbusters
Corp., an advocate of online privacy. ``They should be a commodity
service, and you should be able to switch easily if they raise
prices or start invading your privacy.'' Catlett noted that e-mail
tended to tie people to their ISPs. He suggested breaking that link
by using an e-mail forwarding service (like Pobox.com, Ziplink or a
college alumni group that offers lifetime e-mail addresses). That
way you can keep one e-mail address, regardless of how many times
you change providers.

HEARING THE CALL OF THE `LOON' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Like so many tales of hard-won literary fame, this one
begins with a lawn mower running over a bird.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been debating over the years the various scenarios for
the bird,'' said Eric Paul Johnson, who wielded the lawn mower 16
years ago. ``Was he deceased (already)? Was it a suicide?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Was he deaf?'' asked Mike Sortino. ``He didn't get out of the
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, the bird's death was an inspiration to the
two.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, this struck me as hilarious,'' Sortino said.
Instead of merely laughing, he bolted to Johnson's room and pounded
out a satirical story about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The severed head was still on the lawn,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Under such grisly circumstances the ``Loon News'' was born. If
you haven't heard of the satirical newspaper, welcome to the club.
In its 16-year run, Johnson and Sortino, both Valley residents,
have handed out Xerox copies of the paper to anyone who wants them
(for a copy, write to 507 E. Campo Bello, Phoenix, AZ 85022, or
letters(at)loonnews.com via e-mail). A word-of-mouth kind of thing.
Yet despite its lengthy existence, circulation usually hovers
around 45. Depending.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we run out we do more,'' Sortino said. &QL; 
Committed pair &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But size isn't important, as they say. The great thing about the
``Loon News'' is Johnson and Sortino's never-ending dedication to
creating it.
</P>
<P>
   Sortino is a writer. Johnson too, though his real love is
cartooning, and his strip, ``Loon News: The Comic Strip!'', is
included in each issue. He is ``waiting for international
syndication of the comic strip and'' _ here Sortino joined in,
finishing the quote as a duet _ ``unending merchandising
possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   To call the ``Loon News'' a free-form publication understates
the case considerably. The two switch editing duties, depending
upon whims and schedules (Sortino works at the Herberger Theater;
Johnson at Target), and fill the ``Loon News'' with whatever
strikes them as funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kind of like Dennis Miller's `Weekend Update,' '' Johnson
said, ``but with some music stories.''
</P>
<P>
   I laughed, but satire is like anchovies _ not everyone
appreciates it. But the real fun is the Loon state of mind.
Remember the ``clear'' craze? Pepsi Clear and all that? They
cranked out ``Loon News Clear,'' a one-page issue printed on a
transparent sheet. Then there was Loon Aid, their answer to Live
Aid, and, perhaps, most memorably, their sendup of Hands Across
America _ Hands Across Eric's Bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a disaster,'' Johnson said, noting that the only
participants were him and two cats. ``I wanted to raise $200,000. I
raised 75 cents.'' &QL; 
Life goes on &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There have been dark times, certainly, when one or the other or
both nearly gave up on ``Loon News.'' Moves, jobs and other
real-life hindrances have interfered.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had asked me when I was 14 if I would be doing it at
30, I would have said `No' and called you a name,'' Sortino said.
``We've had so many `last' issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But they have soldiered bravely on, satirizing anything in
sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing we've learned is that you can't kill it,'' Johnson
said. ``No matter what you do, it keeps coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   They've added a staff member, Mychele Dee. She writes and takes
care of their new Web page (www.loonnews.com), and during our chat
they sounded optimistic about the ``Loon New's'' future. Actually,
they made it sound like they didn't have anything better to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seen all the TV shows,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, sort of, the two are as dedicated to the ``Loon
News'' as any artist is to his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a frustrated non-working writer, it's a good outlet for
me,'' Sortino said. Johnson concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of don't see the point of writing all these stories and
drawing all these 'toons and stashing it away in a corner and not
showing anyone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So they don't. Here's hoping they never do. &QL;

MOBILIZING ON LINE FOR GUN CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By KATIE HAFNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Petitions that circulate on the Internet are an iffy
proposition. Many of them, no matter how lofty the cause, smack of
spam. Understandably, people often ignore them.
</P>
<P>
   But a citizens' advocacy group, Move On (www.moveon.org), which
last year circulated an online petition calling for Congress to
``censure President Clinton and move on,'' is distinguishing itself
as a model for online plebiscites.
</P>
<P>
   Move On said it had gathered 500,000 electronic signatures
during the Clinton impeachment last year. In an ancillary campaign
called We Will Remember, the group said it had received pledges
amounting to $13 million and 700,000 volunteer hours for year 2000
political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the school shootings in Littleton, Colo., last
month, Move On turned its attention to gun control. So far, the
group, based in Berkeley, Calif., said its Gun Safety First
campaign had gathered more than 70,000 signatures on an
Internet-based petition urging Congress to ``accept its proper role
in regulating firearms.''
</P>
<P>
   And last week, as the Senate debated a bill intended to reduce
crime among juveniles, printouts of the petition signatures
gathered so far were delivered by hand truck to the offices of the
Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, and the minority
leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota. Move On said that more than
100,000 individual e-mail messages had been sent, through the site,
to senators across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Blades, a co-founder of Move On, said the group's goal was
to see that legislation would ``include some common-sense measures
to make it more difficult for children to gain access to weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Blades and Wes Boyd, who helped to start Move On, are the
flying toasters people. To be more precise, they founded Berkeley
Systems, which created After Dark, the popular screen-saver program
known for winged appliances. After selling Berkeley Systems two
years ago, Ms. Blades and Boyd began developing educational
software from their home in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   When talk of impeachment started in earnest last year, Ms.
Blades and Boyd started the Moveon.org Web site, for $89. Whether
the group will be able to duplicate the momentum it achieved with
the censure initiative is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gut tells me it's not necessarily true that the things that
bring one constituency together would sustain it on other issues,''
said Jonah Seiger, co-founder and principal of Mindshare Internet
Campaigns, a consulting company based in Washington. ``The
half-million people who signed up to support the position
articulated in the Move On impeachment campaign may not necessarily
share the same view on gun control.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Blades expressed the opposite belief. ``I think this
discrepancy between what is going on inside the Beltway and public
opinion outside the Beltway is the key similarity with the Gun
Safety First petition,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, just how effective any online political effort can be is
difficult to gauge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effectiveness is minimal, at best, until we're able to
legalize initiatives on line,'' said Fred Kimball, president of
Kimball Petition Management, a political consulting firm in
Westlake Village, Calif., referring to recent efforts in California
to make online signatures valid in ballot initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Seiger is more sanguine. ``What Move On showed from the
beginning is the way the Net is truly changing the political
process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Blades said she and Boyd were looking into other areas that
might lend themselves to online activism, like environmental
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intention is just to allow people to become involved,
become a five-minute activist if you want to,'' she said.

<P>
   ``Star Wars'' invasion begins this week (May 19).
</P>
<P>
   In our very own galaxy, a cinematic event will have occurred
that some folks have been waiting for all their lives. And even if
YOU haven't been, you won't be able to avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' a prequel to the
original trilogy, might be the most highly anticipated movie of all
time. Consider this:
</P>
<P>
   Moviegoers recently paid full price to get into theaters showing
``Phantom'' trailers _ preview clips shown before feature films _
and many left without seeing whatever movie was playing.
</P>
<P>
   Toys R Us stores around the country opened their doors at 12:01
a.m. May 3 for an all-night ``Phantom'' merchandise marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Fans began buying tickets weeks ahead of this week's opening.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 2 million adults will take time off work to see the
flick.
</P>
<P>
   Kasey Nutter, 11, is so pumped about ``Phantom'' that her family
bought tickets early.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just really exciting because I can kind of see the future
being like that. I think it would be cool if we could go in
different galaxies and meet aliens,'' said Kasey, a sixth-grader.
</P>
<P>
   Plot details for the new movie have been kept under wraps, but
it is known that it involves the introduction of a young Obi-Wan
Kenobi to Anakin Skywalker (who at some point becomes a Jedi
knight, turns to evil and becomes Darth Vader. Oh, and he is the
father of twins, Luke and Leia).
</P>
<P>
   The science-fiction epic started with ``Star Wars: Episode IV _
A New Hope,'' which opened on May 25, 1977. With $461 million in
ticket sales, it's second only to ``Titanic,'' which made $600
million. ``Phantom'' is expected to bring in $1.2 billion or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Empire Strikes Back'' opened in 1980 and ``Return of the
Jedi'' followed in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The Star Wars tale is being told backward; the setting of
``Phantom'' and the upcoming prequels is ``before'' the trilogy. A
second prequel is scheduled to hit theaters in 2002. The third
installment is due out in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Intergalactic Facts:
</P>
<P>
   Title: ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars: Ewan McGregor plays young Obi-Wan Kenobi (a role made
famous in the original by Sir Alec Guinness). Samuel L. Jackson and
Liam Neeson play Jedi knights. Natalie Portman plays Queen Amidala,
the future mother of Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia. Jake Lloyd
plays Anakin Skywalker, the future Darth Vader.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: PG.
</P>
<P>
   Budget: Prequel: $110 million. Original: about $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Cost of a Han Solo action figure in 1978: less than $15.
</P>
<P>
   Cost of the same action figure in mint condition in 1999: $550.

<P>
   Name: Jake Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
   Age: 10.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: Finishing fourth grade.
</P>
<P>
   Claim to fame: Plays a young Anakin Skywalker in ``Star Wars:
Episode I _ The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Hobbies: Rides his bike, plays with friends, cares for his dog,
a Shih Tzu.
</P>
<P>
   Acting experience: Played Arnold Schwarzenegger's son in
``Jingle All the Way,'' plus parts in ``Unhook the Stars'' and the
television show ``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   Jake won the role of the future Darth Vader after a two-year
casting search. He plays an innocent slave boy who is strong with
the Force in Phantom Menace.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got the part, I started yelling,'' he said. ``Then I
took a deep breath and thought, `Oh my gosh _ I got ``Star Wars!''
Then I yelled some more. Then I started crying,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vader's always been my favorite ``Star Wars'' character,''
Jake said. ``Vader's really a good guy. He's the only one who could
destroy the emperor in the end'' (in ``Return of the Jedi''.)
</P>
<P>
   Jake loves video games, especially a new ``Star Wars Pod-Racer''
game he received before its May 20 release. He says the video game
version is more fun than it was shooting a pod race scene for the
movie, which he did while sitting still. A cheering crowd, roaring
engines, twisting race course and harrowing tunnels were inserted
later, using computer imagery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only played the pod-racing game for about five hours,''
Jake said Sunday. ``But I've beaten the first beginner stage.''

   High-Tech Diary
</P>
<P>
   Diary dilemma: You lose your key to the lock.
</P>
<P>
   No prob. The newest journals and diaries for girls are
electronic. Access is gained through creating, then using, a
``voice'' password. The Password Journal from Girl Tech, made by
Radica, is one such product that's bound to be a hot seller. Inside
is a secret key compartment, just in case you need to change your
password. Anything to keep that brother from spying on your private
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Pens With Punch
</P>
<P>
   Black ink is soooo boring. Pink, green, purple, silver and blue
are so much more fun for writing notes and doodling, says high
school student Megan Carroll. Pens take on every color of the
rainbow nowadays thanks to new plastic technology. Bic is drawing
young fans with its Shimmers line of six translucent colored pens,
priced at $2.99 a package.
</P>
<P>
   Bic Shimmers come in tropical shades of fuschia, lavender,
turquoise and lime.
</P>
<P>
   Odd Tooners
</P>
<P>
   Unless you've been sleeping in the Twilight Zone, you've seen
``Cat Dog,'' the popular Nickelodeon television series. Talk about
the ultimate odd couple. Dog enjoys rolling in the mud and eating
garbage while Cat wishes to pursue hobbies with dignity and
decorum. As a result, the fur often flies.
</P>
<P>
   From now through July, look for furry new CatDog toys from
Mattel, ranging from Stretch CatDog ($7.99) to Wacky Yakking
CatDog, an interactive plush toy that talks ($36).
</P>
<P>
   Razor Pizazz
</P>
<P>
   The glitter trend in makeup spills over to the bath with a new
line of sparkle razors from Gillette. The Women Sensor Dazzlers
come in three trendy, glittery hues __ ``Funky Fuschia,'' ``Go Girl
Green'' and ``Party on Purple.'' Each razor sells for $1.99 at
grocery stores and drugstores.
</P>
<P>
   Tips for beginners: 1. Get permission from a parent who can
teach you how to begin. 2. Soak area in warm water a few minutes to
soften hairs. 3. For smoother shaving and less dryness, use shaving
cream or gel. 4. Use a light touch and let the razor do the work
for you.

ADVICE ABOUT SCHOOL VIOLENCE 
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 FROM THE FORT WORTH STAR-TELEGRAM
</HEADLINE>
  World rights. 
 Copyright 1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR TeensTalk: I am a high school sophomore. I am very worried
about school violence such as the recent shooting in Colorado. I
have been watching the news and realize this could happen at my
school or any school. More incidents like this are now happening.
</P>
<P>
   I was walking to class yesterday and a guy followed me into
class wearing a black leather trench coat. It really scared me and
several other classmates. I talked to the teacher to see if she was
going to do something, but she said he hadn't done anything wrong.
She also said she was afraid to talk to him.
</P>
<P>
   How can I let someone in the school know about this student and
not get my teacher or the student mad at me? I really feel that
someone needs to talk to him. I'm worried that more violence will
occur and more people will be hurt. I'm really scared to go to
school. I told my mom I was sick today and couldn't go. What can I
do to help our school? _ Scared.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR Scared: You are voicing a fear that many students share.
The first step to resolve your fears and help your school is:
communicate. You were correct in talking with your teacher.
</P>
<P>
   You could also talk to school counselors or principals and voice
your concerns about the way this student is dressed and acting.
Your school administration can talk to the student and let him know
that his clothing does not necessarily involve him in such violent
activities, but that he may want to select different clothes during
this time.
</P>
<P>
   The clothes didn't make this incident occur; the actions of the
students involved and beliefs created the actions. The clothes only
hid the weapons.
</P>
<P>
   By communicating your fears, you will make more people aware of
the actions of students in your school, and they will be more
likely to help prevent future incidents. The old saying, ``It takes
a village to raise a child,'' means that everyone needs to take
responsibility for the future generation.

STAR STRUCK? CHECK OUT YOUR WEEK 
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

<P>
   Before finalizing your activities, take time to read the
following horoscope, which is a fun way to plan your week.
</P>
<P>
   GEMINI (May 21 - June 20): This week, you will be presented with
many options as far as summer activities are concerned. You had
better choose wisely, or your summer may be a complete and total
flop. Think about the people concerned and the fun you will have.
</P>
<P>
   CANCER (June 21 - July 22): Oftentimes you are too soft-hearted
when it comes to sticking with decisions. This week, when you make
a difficult decision about something, stick to it. Otherwise,
people will come to expect that you will not be firm in any choice
you make; they may play on your weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   LEO (July 23 - Aug. 22): All you ever do is run around looking
for someone to be interested in you as a boy/girlfriend. If you
would just stop, then the perfect person would probably come
straight into your arms. Make it a point not to concentrate on the
lack of a significant other in your life this week.
</P>
<P>
   VIRGO (Aug. 23 - Sept. 22): Things consistently go well for you.
Be sure you are aware of this when people come to you for advice.
They are judging from the veneer, and it may help to show them a
new perspective. Give them a look at the behind-the-scenes action,
and it may ease their pain.
</P>
<P>
   LIBRA (Sept. 23 - Oct. 22): Start planning your
end-of-the-school-year party when you can clearly see the end of
the tunnel. You do not want to get so caught up in what you are
going to do after school that you fail to perform during school,
when it matters the most. As you start to turn in all of your
projects, put some extra oomph in them and try to get the ``A.''
</P>
<P>
   SCORPIO (Oct. 23 - Nov. 21): This week will have every kind of
test and challenge in it. By Thursday, it will be apparent to your
friends and family that you are not in a rational state of mind.
However, if you can make it through Thursday, you might be able to
coast into next week. Make time to have fun this weekend, but make
even more time to catch up on sleep.
</P>
<P>
   SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22 - Dec. 21): You might find yourself being
abnormally free this week. Both your time and your privileges will
seem to open up, and you might not know how to react. However, if
you spend more than one night at home alone, this free time may not
mean anything to you. Meet a coupla new people so you can spruce up
your new-found freedom.
</P>
<P>
   CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 19): Everything from the grade on the
pop quiz to the party that awaits you at the end of the week is
rolling the right way. You cannot lose! You will have all of your
friends on your side if anyone tries to confront you this week.
Your friends are going to reveal to you a new side this week. They
will constantly be looking out for you.
</P>
<P>
   AQUARIUS (Jan. 20 - Feb. 18): Be supportive of all your friends
at all times, even when you do not completely agree with what they
have to say. Just like you need them, they, too, need to be
comforted in rough situations. When you do not know what to do, ask
your parents; they have been through everything and then some. They
are the best when it comes to advice. Learn that now.
</P>
<P>
   PISCES (Feb. 19 - March 20): Pretty soon you will be able to
spend days upon end with your friends, so take advantage of the
light homework you have and spend the time at home with the family.
Some families hardly ever see each other during the summer. But
your family will not suffer this year. Your older siblings make
great tutors and awesome company.
</P>
<P>
   ARIES (March 21 - April 19): You will soon have to bid farewell
to someone very dear to your heart. You two still have plenty of
time to make some wonderful memories before the departure. Use your
time wisely and be sure to have plenty of fun.
</P>
<P>
   TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): Something unbelievably crazy will
happen to you in the next few days. You may have to pinch your arm
to realize you aren't dreaming. Things like this do not happen
often, so take plenty of pictures and have a great time.

   A HUG OF ACCEPTANCE
</P>
<P>
   Kelli Linton is trying to bring a stop to teen violence, one
person at a time.
</P>
<P>
   After two teens in a group of outcasts shot 12 classmates and a
teacher at a Colorado high school, Kelli decided to hug every
student at her campus.
</P>
<P>
   Under Operation Heart to Heart, Kelli created green cards that
read, ``You are loved and accepted. Pass it on.'' She has been
hugging classmates and handing them cards two at a time, one to
keep and one to give away with a hug of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is I want to let them know that I love them and that I
accept them no matter who they are or what they've done,'' said
Kelli, a junior at Fort Worth's Carter-Riverside High. ``It's not
just a one-week campaign or crusade, and it's not a hug-a-thon.
It's an ongoing thing. Once you get to know a person and find out
about someone, you'll find out that no matter what they look like,
they're still fun people. I want students to reach out to people
they don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   CELEBRATING MOM
</P>
<P>
   Nikki Melanson's flower artwork about how much she loves her mom
was painted into the ice at Fort Worth Outlet Square last week for
all to enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Nikki, 12, a sixth-grader, was the winner of a Mother's Day
coloring contest among kids who go to child care through the YMCA
of Metropolitan in Fort Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Nikki and her pals and others at the YMCA had a skating and
pizza party recently to celebrate. Her artwork, enlarged to 10 feet
by 8 feet, was chosen from almost 100 entries.
</P>
<P>
   FREEDOMS
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 bills filed in the Texas Legislature would limit
teen-agers in some way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just happen to be at a time in our history where I think
teen-agers ... are feared much more than they have been in the
past,'' said Laurence Steinberg, professor of psychology at Temple
University.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the major pieces of legislation that are showing
potential for becoming laws this session include requiring minors
to tell their parents before they have an abortion; to have
parents' consent for body piercing; and to have adult supervision
during the first year of driving, with graduated driver licenses.

SHORT ITEMS ON COMPUTERS AND GADGETS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An Upstart Unveils Rival to the Game Boy &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With millions of Game Boys sold worldwide, Nintendo has
practically owned the handheld computer amusement market for a
decade. At the recent Electronics Entertainment Expo in Los
Angeles, SNK, a game maker best known for its presence in video
arcades, unveiled its effort to end Game Boy's reign.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Neo Geo Pocket Color, the 16-bit, processor-based
game machine is smaller, lighter and faster than Game Boy players,
SNK said, and it can display ``nearly three times as many colors as
Nintendo's Game Boy Color.''
</P>
<P>
   The Neo Geo system, housed in a sleek horizontal case (Game
Boy's case is vertical), is capable of rendering 146 colors
simultaneously on its 2.6-inch display screen, compared with Game
Boy's slightly smaller display, which can show 52 colors at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   The Neo Geo Pocket Color machines also have a thumb-friendly,
built-in joystick, rather than the four-point directional game
controller that Nintendo uses on its portable and console machines.
</P>
<P>
   Neo Geo Pocket Color machines will cost $69.95, $10 less than a
Game Boy Color. Beginning on June 1, they will be sold on line
through the company's Web site at www.snkusa.com and later in the
year in stores.
</P>
<P>
   Ten Neo Geo games are available, with 10 more expected later
this summer, Ms. Sujishi said. At last count, Game Boy Color can
play 450 original titles, including those made for black-and-white
Game Boys.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeremy Schwartz, a senior analyst at Forrester Research in
Cambridge, Mass., is skeptical of any newcomer's chances of
dislodging Game Boy as a favorite among players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Game Boy is so entrenched at this point, with so many people
making so many well-known game properties for it, these guys are
going to have a very hard time getting any widespread consumer
acceptance of it,'' said Schwartz, an expert on games. He said
there was a long trail of other gaming machines crushed by Game
Boys. ``They're the master,'' he said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Consultant Reports a Flaw In Ebay's Web Site Security &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nothing lasts for long on Ebay, the popular online auction
house, except, apparently, potential security flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Cervenka, a consultant in Edmonton, Alberta, recently found
a bug that can redirect personal information _ including passwords
_ from the Ebay site (www.ebay.com) to his own computer. But the
company has not remedied the security gap.
</P>
<P>
   Cervenka found that by inserting bits of the programming
language Javascript into a description of an item for auction, he
could surreptitiously get the screen name and Ebay password for the
bidders on that item.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw the site, I just decided to try a couple things
that are common, wide-open, potential security holes, and I was
surprised that everything I tried seemed to work,'' said Cervenka,
a member of Because We Can (www.because-we-can.com), an informal
organization of people with an interest in security.
</P>
<P>
   With an Ebay screen name and password, an intruder could place
unauthorized bids and start bogus auctions while impersonating an
unsuspecting victim. Similar security problems could exist with
online e-mail systems and chat sites, Cervenka said, where the user
has the ability to modify a Web site. When Cervenka sent Ebay
e-mail about the security problem, he said he received only a form
letter in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are certainly aware of the fact that if you use the
Javascript, that what he described can indeed occur,'' said Kevin
Pursglove, a spokesman for Ebay. He also said that the company
intended to continue allowing the use of Javascript because many
people use it to enhance graphics in their descriptions of auction
items.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Cervenka, he said, ``We do know that if someone
uses the script the way the gentleman suggests, and there were any
intrusion to an account, we have the ability to identify the
violator of that within an hour's time and move promptly to suspend
them from Ebay.''
</P>
<P>
   No such suspensions have occurred, he said, adding that bidders'
credit-card information remains inaccessible.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Kelley &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Keeping `Star Trek' Alive As the TV Series Goes Dark &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also from Electronics Entertainment Expo: Fans of ``Star Trek:
Deep Space 9'' need not worry about losing track of their favorite
characters as the television series ends its seventh and final
season next week. The space opera, full of souls looking for peace
and redemption, can go on in the claustrophobic world of a new 3-D
computer game.
</P>
<P>
   Called Star Trek Deep Space 9: The Fallen, the CD-ROM-based
action game is part of a coordinated, two-year-long strategy to
extend the ``Deep Space 9'' franchise through computer games,
novels, comics and audio books.
</P>
<P>
   The game, which allows players to be any one of the show's three
main characters _ Sisko, Worf or Kira _ is a winner-take-all
adventure. Billions of lives hang on practically every mouse click.
</P>
<P>
   But all of the digital daring will have to wait a while. Though
the books will be published later this year, the game, the company
said, will not be on store shelves until early next year. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Where Miss Liberty Welcomed Huddled Masses, Now on CD &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just as Ellis Island was the port of entry for millions of
immigrants, South Peak Interactive in Cary, N.C., is hoping that
its new CD-ROM, The Ellis Island Experience, will be the port of
entry for millions of computer users when it is released next year.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM, created with the help of the History Channel and the
Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation, contains images of
hundreds of artifacts, newly released documents and photographs.
There are also three hours of audio from the Ellis Island Oral
History project as well as a 3-D virtual tour of the island and
lots of video. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Headset Offers Movie Sound Without Going to the Theater &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Surround sound, a movie-theater-like audio experience, is
becoming increasingly popular in living rooms by way of
many-speakered home entertainment systems and personal computers
bearing speakers bigger than the computers themselves. But you no
longer need to be surrounded by a battery of expensive speakers to
get surround sound.
</P>
<P>
   At E3, Sony announced the availability of cordless stereo
headphones that create surround sound. The headphones, called
MDR-DS5000, work in conjunction with a small base transmitter that
produces a multidimensional sound that listeners hear not only from
side to side, but also from front to back.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the sound is a convincing illusion. But at $549.99,
the manufacturer's suggested retail price is real enough. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   V-Chip in New Televisions &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In just a few months, half of the new televisions sold in the
United States will be required by federal law to include a V-chip,
a device that enables parents to block programs from appearing on
their television screens.
</P>
<P>
   But there's just one problem: the rating system that makes the
V-chip possible has been out for more than a year, but it isn't
used by most parents. In fact, the number of parents using the
ratings has declined to 22 percent from 31 percent in the last
year. The figures come from a survey of 1,000 parents that was
conducted last month by the Kaiser Foundation and the Center for
Media Education.
</P>
<P>
   To Kathryn Montgomery, president of the center, the drop can be
explained by the lack of recent media coverage of the V-chip. She
said the survey also showed how much people needed to be educated
about the V-chip. ``It's all very new,'' she added. ``It's going to
take awhile.''

ON CBS, IT'S NOT A FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CBS, the only broadcast network not infatuated with youth,
announced a fall lineup Wednesday that blends young actors with
older ones in its new shows, and mixes new shows and established
ones on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Network chief executive Leslie Moonves said that one highly
regarded new drama with a Mafia theme and a great deal of violence
had been kept off the schedule at least in part because of the high
school shootings in Littleton, Colo., in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the time to have people being whacked on the
streets of New York,'' Moonves told reporters before making the
network's presentation to advertisers at Carnegie Hall yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   He said he and his staff had screened the pilot episode for the
show, called ``Falcone,'' a week after the Littleton tragedy, and
had ``cringed.'' Even though he characterized ``Falcone'' as ``a
very high-quality show, really very well done,'' he said, ``We felt
a responsibility not to put it on the schedule now.''
</P>
<P>
   At the presentation to advertisers, Moonves exuded confidence,
buoyed in part by news that his network had clinched first place in
total viewers for the season, which ends next week. But CBS will
finish fourth among the 18-to-49-year-olds, a group the other major
networks woo ardently because advertisers pay higher rates to reach
them.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves said CBS was striving to be ``bimodal,'' seeking shows
that appeal to younger adults without alienating CBS's loyal older
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, three new shows feature an older and younger actor
in key roles: Tyne Daly as the mother of Amy Brennerman's lead
character in ``Judging Amy,'' Betty White as the mother of Alfred
Molina's lead in ``Ladies Man,'' and Margaret Colin as a
middle-aged wife whose husband has been transformed by a freak
accident into someone 20 years younger, a covert government agent
(Eric Close), in ``Now and Again.''
</P>
<P>
   Moonves described the new schedule as ``a little bit aggressive,
but not at all messing with stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Saturday and Sunday rosters remain intact from this
season. All three news magazines remain, with ``60 Minutes II'' and
``48 Hours'' both getting potentially stronger lead-in shows ahead
of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago Hope,'' with Mandy Patinkin back as Dr. Geiger and
David E. Kelley promising to write more episodes, has moved to 9
p.m. Thursday, from 10 p.m. on Wednesday. It will lead into ``48
Hours.''
</P>
<P>
   ``60 Minutes II'' moves to Tuesdays at 9 p.m., preceded by the
popular ``JAG,'' and followed by ``Judging Amy.'' CBS switched its
midweek movie from Tuesday to Wednesday, where it will be preceded
by ``Cosby'' at 8 p.m. (moving from Monday) and, at 8:30 p.m., a
new comedy, ``Work with Me,'' starring Nancy Travis and Kevin
Pollak as married law partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``King of Queens,'' a solid performer this season, moves
backward 30 minutes to replace ``Cosby'' at 8 p.m. on Monday,
followed by ``Ladies Man.'' CBS's hit comedy ``Everybody Loves
Raymond'' remains at 9, followed by ``Becker'' and ``Family Law,''
another legal drama, this one starring Kathleen Quinlan as a lawyer
who starts a new firm after her partner-husband leaves her, taking
many clients with him.
</P>
<P>
   Two new shows will appear on Friday nights. ``Love or Money,''
at 8:30 p.m., is an ensemble comedy about a building superintendent
who falls in love with the wealthy heiress living in the penthouse.
``Now and Again,'' at 9 p.m., is the drama about the middle-age
insurance man suddenly transformed into a government agent with a
rebuilt body.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. Doctors'' and ``Promised Land'' were canceled; ``Candid
Camera'' is on hiatus and could return as a substitute if another
show does poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the CBS schedule:
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY: 7 p.m., ``60 Minutes''; 8, ``Touched by an Angel''; 9,
``CBS Sunday Movie.''
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY: 8 p.m., ``King of Queens''; 8:30, ``Ladies Man''; 9,
``Everybody Loves Raymond''; 9:30, ``Becker''; 10, ``Family Law.''
</P>
<P>
   TUESDAY: 8 p.m., ``JAG''; 9, ``60 Minutes II''; 10, ``Judging
Amy.''
</P>
<P>
   WEDNESDAY: 8 p.m., ``Cosby''; 8:30, ``Work With Me''; 9, ``CBS
Wednesday Movie.''
</P>
<P>
   THURSDAY: 8 p.m., ``Diagnosis Murder''; 9, ``Chicago Hope''; 10,
``48 Hours.''
</P>
<P>
   FRIDAY: 8 p.m., ``Kids Say the Darndest Things''; 8:30, ``Love
of Money''; 9, ``Now and Again''; 10, ``Nash Bridges.''
</P>
<P>
   SATURDAY: 8 p.m., ``Early Edition''; 9, ``Martial Law''; 10,
``Walker, Texas Ranger.''

 By TRACIE ROZHON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the center of the mantel, there's an 8-inch wood
plaque bought in the gift shop at the federal penitentiary in
Lewisburg, Pa. The painted plaque shows the prison as it looks now,
and as it looked when Tony Hiss' father, Alger Hiss, occupied a
cell there, convicted of perjury back in the 1950s for saying he
didn't pass secrets to Whittaker Chambers, an admitted communist
spy.
</P>
<P>
   The plaque is the newest memento in the Hiss apartment, the same
two-bedroom walk-up on East Eighth Street that Alger and Prossy
Hiss rented in 1947, when they moved up from Washington; the
apartment where Tony Hiss grew up; the apartment that Hiss, now 57,
shares with his own son, Jacob, 7, and his wife, Lois Metzger, who
writes sophisticated novels for teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   The apartment, along with the prison cell, is a central
character in ``The View From Alger's Window'' ($24), a memoir by
Tony Hiss, due from Alfred A. Knopf in early June.
</P>
<P>
   From the cell, the view was of long ridges of dark woods, large
red barns and a blue house. On Eighth Street, the view from Alger's
window is, still, out the back.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenwich Village apartment overlooks a small courtyard,
facing south. ``The top half of this view is all sky _ a great,
arching, almost Western-sized sky,'' wrote the son, whose
reflections on urban design have appeared in The New Yorker, as
well as in nine books. Below the sky and neighboring rooftops,
``there's a forest-canopy view of a miniature orchard of 10
ornamental Japanese crab apple trees.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, crab apple blossoms, the deep rosy pink kind,
were pushing against the third-floor windows, frothing, as Alger
Hiss remembered them when he started writing letters from prison.
Only three a week (to seven approved recipients) were allowed and
each only two pages long. He filled the pages with a tiny scrawl,
punctuated by pen and ink sketches of the furniture in his cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of what is here is what they brought with them from
Washington, full of optimism,'' Tony Hiss explained. ``The desk,
the sofa, the piano, the table, the chair, the same green enamel
kitchen table where I read his prison letters when I was 11 and
where I read the same letters again last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The apartment is in a time warp. When the building's super
wanted to replace the toilet _ a period piece with a round (yes,
round) tank and a tiny brass lever in the middle that says,
``Push,'' the Hisses wrote to the landlord in protest. ``This
toilet belongs in the Smithsonian,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen, too, is a throwback, with the same 1940s white
enamel gas stove, shelves and sink. Only the refrigerator, covered
with Jacob's drawings, speaks of the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, look at this,'' Hiss said. ``It was in the closet, and we
hung it on the wall.'' It is the presentation copy of the preamble
to the United Nations Charter. His father was secretary-general of
the founding conference in San Francisco in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   The memoir details the almost four years that Alger Hiss spent
in prison, from March 1951 to November 1954, the years when Sen.
Joseph McCarthy, R-Wis., raged, destroying, some say, the careers
of thousands of suspected communists and communist sympathizers,
before his own decline and demise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alger went to jail two weeks before McCarthy made his famous
maiden speech,'' Hiss said. ``Alger's conviction really  &UR; created &LR; 
McCarthy, in a way.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who are too young to remember the Hiss case, it was
the case that shook the nation. Books still stream forth, arguing
for and against Alger Hiss' guilt. Last Thursday, when a federal
judge ordered the grand jury testimony from the case unsealed,
legal scholars and historians lined up again, to ask, and to try to
answer the same old questions.
</P>
<P>
   Did Whittaker Chambers make up the whole story about Hiss'
passing government secrets? Did the government and an ambitious
young congressman, Rep. Richard M. Nixon, R-Calif., railroad Hiss
with questionable or manufactured evidence? Or was Hiss a Soviet
spy, with a hefty bank account hidden in Switzerland: a man who was
a truly great actor, as his accusers claimed?
</P>
<P>
   Tony Hiss' book does not argue the case, although he does cast
his father in a new light. ``This is the first time anyone has seen
the 445 letters that Alger wrote during the time he was in jail,''
Hiss said. ``In all these letters, there is not one that even hints
at any admiration for anything communist. Marx never comes up, only
Freud and, of course, Justice Holmes.'' (As a young man, Alger Hiss
clerked for the aged Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes.)
``Would someone who could write these letters be the evil spy his
enemies painted him as?'' Hiss asked.
</P>
<P>
   The letters will be a surprise to those who saw only the public
Alger Hiss, who, even in his son's view, projected a cold and
lawyerly aspect. They are wildly playful and supportive of his
young son, who was 9 when his father went to jail and 13 when he
came out; a son who, for the agonizing months of one trial, which
resulted in a hung jury, and then a second, was taken in by wealthy
supporters on Manhattan's Upper East Side.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought it wouldn't be pleasant for a kid,'' Hiss
explained. ``And of course, they assumed he'd be found not guilty
and we'd all be back together again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up very fast intellectually,'' he continued.
``Emotionally, I grew a lot slower.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he never thought of changing his last name _ despite the
occasional ``weird'' phone calls he still gets. And he never
thought of living anywhere but Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   Now, his son occupies what was his own bedroom, a large,
blue-walled cube overlooking the crab apples. Hiss and Ms. Metzger
hang out in the larger master bedroom, with a papier-mache volcano
Jacob made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this apartment,'' said Ms. Metzger, 43. ``I don't think
of it as Alger's, but I think of it as the Hiss family's.''
Referring to its basically unchanged 1950s hominess, she added:
``It's certainly not a shrine. We have the volcano, an ashtray that
Jacob made that says `No Smoking' on it _ he thought that was
really funny! _ a piece of the cow mosaic from the old Cookery
restaurant that Tony found on the street and Jacob's toy cars in
practically every room.'' She paused. ``And, yes, because it's full
of memories, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Metzger's most recent novel, ``Missing Girls,'' is a highly
autobiographical account of her own growing up in Queens, the
granddaughter of a Holocaust survivor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both survivors of something,'' Hiss said.
</P>
<P>
   On the mantel next to the prison plaque is a little oil painting
with a Christmas message painted into the bottom: ``Peace on Earth
to Men of Good Will,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend of Father's sent it to him when he was in jail,''
Hiss said. ``Of course, you couldn't send a painting, so he turned
it into a Christmas card.'' The back is stamped by the censor who
let it through _ one of the tiny victories of prison life.
</P>
<P>
   The book tells of his father's effort to borrow a few books from
the prison library when his family came to visit. The books, Alger
wrote, ``would be chosen with reference to the interests of an
11-year-old and in each instance would be submitted for
examination.'' The purpose was ``to lighten the tedium of a full
two hours of unrelieved inactivity for a child.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Hiss never knew of the request, or that it was denied,
until he started writing his memoir.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, it's a book I've been working on for 50 years,'' he
said. ``In another way, it's a book that began with the birth of my
own son, which allowed me to stop thinking of myself as the son and
to start thinking as a father. Then there was my father's death in
1996. I started to see things as a whole. Then the wonderful luck
that my mother had saved such a packet of letters.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there was ``the generous offer of the prison system,''
allowing Hiss and his wife to visit Alger Hiss' cell before his
wing, the honor wing, was obliterated by renovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``So here was a place that when I was a boy, he couldn't leave
and I couldn't enter,'' he wrote about his visit to the Lewisburg
cell late in 1997. ``Now I could stand in the spot where all the
letters came from. My father, looking for parallels, had written
that his room was almost as big as mine. It was.''

TOO MUCH PRIVACY IS A CURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Friday May 21)  
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I think it's time that Americans accept the fact that we have no
privacy left and learn to enjoy living life in a fishbowl.
</P>
<P>
   Everything from our driving records to our credit history is
readily available to anyone who's interested. Our names, ages,
addresses, incomes, education and buying habits are all part of a
vast database that is swapped and sold like jelly glasses at a
garage sale.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, I've read that if you have a person's social security
number and know his or her mother's maiden name, you can actually
become that person, which may or may not be a step up, depending on
whose identity you take.
</P>
<P>
   (I would personally opt for someone like Bill Gates, who some
people say I resemble in a bloated, splotchy sort of way, not just
because he is a multibillionaire but because he might know someone
who can debug my computer.)
</P>
<P>
   As far as I know, no one has tried, or shown any interest in
trying, to assume my identity. Whatever personal information of
mine that is out there is simply used by companies that want to
sell me something, preferably just as I'm lifting that first
succulent forkful of Hamburger Helper to my mouth at dinner time.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be no way to stop these people. You could hire
goons to crack some heads, but it would be hard identifying the
proper heads to crack, plus there is no guarantee that there are
enough goons in the world to do the job. A better solution, it
seems to me, would be to offer the companies even more personal
information so they could better tailor their annoying phone calls
and mailings to my specific needs.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the credit card industry seems to have acquired
information that portrays me as the kind of person who needs a
minimum of 62 credit cards. No matter how many times I tell them I
don't need any more credit cards, the calls and letters continue.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, I need to provide some additional personal information
to the credit card companies so they'll go bother somebody else and
leave me alone: My wife only allows me to carry one credit card and
she says she'll take it away if I ever use it. It seems to me that
you are wasting your time trying to give additional credit cards to
someone who uses them (it) for decorative purposes only. (This is
not entirely true. I have used my credit card to scrape bubble gum
off my shoe but this does not happen often and I think one credit
card is probably sufficient for the job.)
</P>
<P>
   I also get a lot of phone calls from people who want to
``spring-tune'' my air conditioner. I'm not in the heating and
cooling business, but I believe that one spring-tuning a year is
all the average air conditioner needs or deserves. If I accepted
the service offers of all the air-conditioning companies that call
me up, I'd have trucks lined up 12 deep, blocking traffic and also
requiring me to use my only credit card, which my wife won't allow
me to do.
</P>
<P>
   If it's not someone wanting to tune up my air conditioner or
send me another credit card, it's someone who wants me to sign up
for lawn care service. (I suspect my neighbor is behind this,
somehow.) I understand why lawn care companies might think of me as
a likely customer because my lawn - otherwise known as ``the
wasteland'' - looks like the aftermath of an experiment involving
napalm and Agent Orange. The only place vegetation grows is in the
cracks in the driveway. (Perhaps it extracts precious nutrients
from the oil stains, it's really hard to say.)
</P>
<P>
   My lawn would benefit from a lawn care service, no doubt, but
once you start down this path, it's hard to get off. How can I
justify watering, fertilizing, spraying and otherwise coddling my
lawn when my air conditioner is wheezing like a three-pack-a-day
smoker and my credit card is glowing like a hot coal?
</P>
<P>
   I'm offering this information not to gain sympathy (though
you're free to feel sorry for me if you wish), but to give the
businesses that have access to my personal file a clearer picture
of who they're dealing with, with the hope, of course, that they'll
be shamed into leaving me alone.
</P>
<P>
   If not, there's always the goons.
</P>

FARM UNION SEEKS NEW ELECTION FOR STRAWBERRY WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Banking on a change of political climate since
its stunning defeat last summer, the United Farm Workers Union is
calling for a representation election at Coastal Berry Inc., the
nation's biggest strawberry grower.
</P>
<P>
   The UFW petitioned the Agricultural Labor Relations Board in
Salinas for the election on Monday, and the board must by law
schedule one on or before May 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that the atmosphere is more conducive to a free and
fair election this year than last,'' said UFW spokesman Marc
Grossman.
</P>
<P>
   Watsonville-based Coastal Berry employs some 1,500 workers and
farms 850 acres in Santa Cruz and Monterey counties and 330 acres
in Ventura County. The company's principal owner, venture
capitalist David Gladstone of Washington, D.C., is regarded as the
berry industry's most pro-union employer and has pledged in writing
to adhere to strict neutrality in the election.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998, Coastal Berry workers voted 523 to 410 to be
represented by the Coastal Berry Farmworkers Committee, a group
which was, paradoxically, opposed to unionization and a vehement
opponent of the UFW.
</P>
<P>
   The UFW refused to participate in that election, asserting that
supervisors had created an atmosphere of fear and coercion that
made a fair election impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The Agricultural Labor Relations Board threw out the results of
that election without examining the UFW claims, instead ruling that
the election was invalid because 162 workers in Ventura County
didn't receive ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Coastal Berry has fired several of the workers who led the
opposition to the UFW's organizing campaign last year.

SENATE REPUBLICAN QUESTIONS HILLARY CLINTON'S N.Y. TRIPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate's top Republican campaign strategist on
Wednesday questioned the propriety of First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton's New York trips at taxpayers' expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times is it appropriate for the First Lady to go to
New York?'' asked Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., chairman of the
National Republican Senatorial Committee, which coordinates all GOP
senate campaigns. ``Is the public in effect underwriting her
campaign?''
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton still undecided over a run next year for the U.S.
Senate seat being vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
McConnell joined New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, whose campaign
aides have criticized the first lady's government-funded official
trips to New York.
</P>
<P>
   She has made eight such trips this year and is scheduled to make
another to New York City beginning Monday. Since each one is an
official trip in her role as first lady, Clinton travels with an
entourage of Secret Service agents and White House aides. The Air
Force jet that flies her around costs $836-an-hour to operate.
</P>
<P>
   A small percentage of these expenses is offset by political
sponsors who invite the first lady to appear at their events. But
the rest are financed by the U.S. treasury. McConnell argues that
since she reaps incalculable political rewards from such
appearances, it's unfair to ask taxpayers to foot the bill.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested there should be some clear line between what is
reimbursable and what is properly charged to the government, but he
offered no specific solution.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was traveling Wednesday to the Southwest and her White
House press office did not respond to telephone calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Malcolm, president of Emily's List and an adviser to the
first lady, called McConnell's comments a ``partisan shot made by
the leading Republican political leader in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm said McConnell is ``well aware there's a process by
which people in White House travel, and I'm sure he saw (then Vice
President George) Bush doing same thing (in 1988 during his
presidential bid) and never said anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Emily's List is a political action committee dedicated to
electing Democratic women who back abortion rights. In 1998,
Emily's List raised $7.5 million to help elect seven women
Democrats to the House and two to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell told reporters he hopes Clinton does choose to run in
New York. ``I think it will be a reinvigorating thing,'' he said.
``This will be a race that will rival the presidential race in
terms of interest across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   He joked that if the first lady decides to enter the race, ``the
best day she has will be the day before she announces.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the two prospective Republican candidates, Giuliani
and Rep. Rick Lazio, is ``intimidated'' by the prospect of facing
her, McConnell said.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that the first lady herself may prove to be the
main issue. ``Lots of the issues the Clintons have had to deal with
in the last eight years will be hashed out,'' McConnell said.
</P>
<P>
   He was alluding to the Whitewater controversy, the Arkansas real
estate deal involving Bill and Hillary Clinton which Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr has been investigating since 1994. The other
controversy that he said Hillary Clinton may find hard to avoid is
the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal that nearly cost President Clinton
his job earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the fact that Mrs. Clinton has never lived in New
York will be a major issue, McConnell said. Giuliani has already
referred to her as a ``carpetbagger'' in speeches.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Isolated potent thunderstorms will erupt across parts of western
Kansas, western Oklahoma and western Texas Thursday afternoon and
evening as moist air rapidly rises along a dry line, which marks
the boundary between dry air from the Rockies and humid air from
the Gulf of Mexico. A jet stream disturbance approaching from New
Mexico will add further lift. Thus, a few storms may reach severe
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, clusters of showers and thunderstorms, some heavy,
will develop early over parts of the central Plains. Storms will
then migrate northeast toward the upper Mississippi Valley and
western Great Lakes later in the day. Heavy rain is possible.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated storms are also possible in southeast Wyoming and
northeast Colorado as moist winds from the east behind a cool front
ascend the westward-sloping terrain. Late Thursday or Thursday
night, another batch of showers and thunderstorms will redevelop
over the central Plains as another jet stream disturbance arrives
from the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated heavy thunderstorms will flare within twenty miles of
the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of Florida as humid air is lifted
along the leading edges of inland-moving sea breezes. Farther
north, rain will gradually taper off across eastern Maine and
extreme southeast New England as a sluggish trough of low pressure
18,000 feet aloft swings slowly toward the Atlantic. Clouds will be
stubborn in spots and may not break until late Thursday or Thursday
night. In the wake of the trough, a bubble of high pressure will
bring a clear, cool night to much of the Northeast. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Sun-enhanced Rain &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes sunshine is necessary for substantial rain. On Tuesday
afternoon, a cold front arrived in western Pennsylvania after
partial to full sunshine had boosted surface air temperatures to
their maximums. The combination of solar heating and lifting by the
cold front resulted in heavy thunderstorms, which left as much as
three inches of rain in southwest Pennsylvania. After sunset,
storms started to weaken, and by the time the slow cold front
approached very dry central Pennsylvania, only very light rain
remained, barely settling the dust caused by a dearth of rain in
May.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Talk about chewing scenery.
</P>
<P>
   Pop, which opened last month on Fourth Avenue near 12th Street,
is much more than just a deafeningly hot eatery with no sign in
front. Read the menu. Not the entrees and appetizers, but a page at
the back titled ``About Pop.'' It's a mouthful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pop is based on the post-war social idealism and trust in
technological innovation, mass production and prefabrication. While
it resonates with this mid-century American dream, Pop has been
realized with end-of-the-century means.''
</P>
<P>
   The author is Ali Tayar, the architect who conceived Pop, a
2,500-square-foot temple of neo-retro chic. The banquettes are
blondly Scandinavian, like many of the models occupying them, and
backlighted with slivers of primary color. The ceiling is a matrix
of cherry-red steel. The jumpsuited wait staff look like gas
station attendants styled by Helmut Lang. But Tayar's 200-word
manifesto, which could have been written for an installation at the
Whitney Biennial, has left some diners scratching their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so over the top,'' said David Swail, a Canadian
newspaper executive, who had dinner there a couple of weeks ago.
``If they could have told me half as much about the food, we would
have been better off.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing influences like Eero Saarinen's TWA terminal at Kennedy
International Airport and ``the trailers of `Dr. No' and
`Contempt,' '' the text goes on to explain that the ``Mondrianesque
colors'' also pay tribute to that same ``homaged era'' _ the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   In short, it's a mod, mod, mod, mod restaurant. It also
signifies the convergence of two ineluctable restaurant trends.
</P>
<P>
   Trend No. 1: The anti-Balthazars. Ripped from the pages of
Wallpaper magazine, they are the antidote to the fake French
bistro: Cafeteria, the space-age luncheonette on Seventh Avenue,
across from Loehmann's; Lot 61, the industrial gallery/meet market
in West Chelsea, and Waterloo, also Tayar's handiwork, a
garage-like eatery in Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   Trend No. 2: High design is now as important as haute cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   Menus used to rhapsodize about the chef's vision and the
provenance of arcane vegetables. Pop's doesn't even mention the guy
in the kitchen, Brian Young, a former chef de cuisine at Le
Bernardin. At Michael Jordan's: The Steakhouse, a sticker has been
added to the bill of fare: ``Winner of Interiors 1998 Best Designed
Restaurant in the Country.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew Nieporent, the restaurateur, won't make a move without
David Rockwell, the designer. Their most recent collaboration is
the Berkeley Bar and Grill in the Sony Building. Adam Tihany, the
architect, is as famous as many of his clients. On the menu at
Artos, a Greek restaurant on the East Side, his name appears before
the chef's. The Zagat Survey's populist point system gives equal
weight to decor, food and service.
</P>
<P>
   These architects _ a profession about as well known for modesty
as the chef trade _ acknowledged the increased prominence but
professed horror at the idea of putting their names on menus.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do get carried away with their egos,'' said Tihany, who
identified himself as ``one of the original people that created the
profession of restaurant design.'' The designer and owner of Remi,
in midtown, he has been at it for 16 years. His credits include Le
Cirque 2000, Jean Georges and the Las Vegas outpost of Aureole,
where a wine steward in harness flies up and down a 42-foot-tall
glass wine tower to fetch bottles for high rollers.
</P>
<P>
   Told that Artos was advertising his name so prominently, Tihany
professed ignorance of the plug and dismissed it. ``It's a
marketing ploy,'' he said. ``Good design is a marketable commodity
for restaurant owners and operators, especially if they can
associate themselves with big-name designers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell, probably the field's closest thing to a household
name, also said he was unaware of any restaurants touting his work
on the menu. But few reviews of Rockwell-designed establishments _
from Nobu's Zen minimalism to the overstimulating maximalism of
Ruby Foo's _ fail to mention his theatrical, conceptual
environments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about a collaborative process,'' Rockwell said. ``We try
to create another reason for people to go in.'' Tihany and Rockwell
insisted that they serve the chef-operator, not the other way
around. ``You don't want to come out of a show singing the sets,''
Rockwell said. ``And you don't want to come out of a restaurant
singing the design.''
</P>
<P>
   Tihany says he thinks of himself as a portrait artist, adding,
``My restaurants are portraits of my clients.'' The 40-foot wine
tower is Charlie Palmer, Aureole's owner, he said, just as the
plush carnival playroom of Le Cirque 2000 is Sirio Maccioni.
``People ask, `What drugs were you taking?''' he said. ``But what
you see is who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Architects used to dream about designing one great chair, Tihany
said. Now, it's one great restaurant.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tayar, 39, sounded somewhat embarrassed at having his design
prospectus, originally written for Pop's press kit, included in the
five-page menu, right after the desserts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want it to go in there,'' he said. ``But Roy thought
that's where it should go.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy is Roy Liebenthal, Pop's owner. After opening Cafe Tabac and
Lemon, Liebenthal has become a specialist in catering to the young,
the beautiful and the people who want to eat near them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roy has an incredible obsession with design,'' Tayar said.
Liebenthal readily admitted to it. ``The design speaks about the
soul of the place,'' he said. ``I've heard a lot of people say the
place looks very Wallpaper. I take that as a compliment.''
</P>
<P>
   Other people have said they found Tayar's elaborate mission
statement ``a bit pompous,'' Liebenthal conceded. The dropped
ceiling is described as ``a riff on standard acoustical tile
systems,'' although its most notable acoustic feature is that it
puts the din in dinner. The ceiling, Tayar writes, also contains
the ``HVAC'' _ a technical abbreviation for heating, ventilation
and air-conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Liebenthal's spin is that it's supposed to be pompous. ``I don't
even understand it,'' he said. ``I thought it played into the whole
futuristic karma of the restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   Tayar, who designed airplane hangars before he got into
restaurants and now sells a line of furniture through ICF, has a
sense of irony about his exaltation by Liebenthal. ``I kept
thinking, as soon as someone has to wait too long for the food, the
first thing they're going to pick on is the text,'' Tayar said.
``They're either going to agree, disagree or make fun of it.''

   You may not have heard the term before, but the chances are
strong that you've seen a lenticular image or two. In fact, it's
almost impossible not to go past one without stopping, cocking your
head and swaying back and forth to get a better look.
</P>
<P>
   They've been stuck on cereal boxes, advertising awnings,
department store displays, postcards and buttons _ and even, in a
very crude form, on CD covers. And in every case, they contain some
kind of eye-catching animation or a 3-D perspective on a picture,
or both.
</P>
<P>
   Since these images don't need a special viewer to display their
optical illusions, they are sometimes called autoanimated and
autostereo images. Some go so far as to call animated 3-D images
4-D images because they add the dimension of time.
</P>
<P>
   The most common misperception is that these pictures are
holograms. They're not. While both types of technology can add
depth to two-dimensional pictures and create animated effects, they
look different, work differently and are used for different
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Holographic images are created by lasers, can be printed on very
thin metallic or transparent sheets and typically display a rainbow
sheen like the reflection on a puddle of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Lenticular images are much thicker because they have a ribbed
plastic surface, and they are generally clearer and brighter than
holograms.
</P>
<P>
   Lenticular images have been around since just after World War
II, when developments in plastics made it possible to create the
ribbed sheet that sits on top of every motion-image card and
autostereo image. These ribbed sheets are called lenses, or
lenticular sheets, because they are actually dozens of
optical-grade cylindrical lenses sitting in parallel lines on top
of several specially prepared images.
</P>
<P>
   The lenses refract the images beneath them so that as your point
of view changes, the image you see changes _ creating the illusion
of movement.
</P>
<P>
   The three-dimensional effect works on the same principle as
Viewmaster stereoscopes: Each eye sees its own version of the same
scene, each taken from a slightly different angle _ just as each
eye sees something a little bit different when viewing something
that is actually three dimensional _ so the brain perceives the
scene in three dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   On a lenticular sheet, each cylindrical lens refracts the
different pictures to different eyes without the need for the
viewer to look into a device.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, the lenticular technique was used for gee-whiz
value. The company that pioneered the process in the 1940s,
Variview, started by making animated political campaign badges with
the slogan ``I Like Ike!'' and moved on to animated cards that were
stuck on boxes of Cheerios.
</P>
<P>
   The technique was apparently too successful _ cards were so
frequently ripped off the boxes that the company had to put them
inside the boxes. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the lenticular
process was used to produce sublime and ridiculous images, from
flicker-image novelty rings and animated postcards of a winking
girl to a 3-D devotional picture of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, since Variview closed its doors, other
commercial studios have continued the tradition. National Graphics,
based in Brookfield, Wis., generated an animated autostereo image
to promote the ``Jurassic Park'' sequel ``The Lost World,'' which
Universal Studios placed on cereal boxes and on the cover of the
videotape.
</P>
<P>
   And Depthography Inc., based in Manhattan, offers a large
catalogue of magnets and lenticular images designed to be hung on
walls. It has developed window displays for Macy's and is working
on a 45-panel animated display for a moving walkway at Kennedy
airport.
</P>
<P>
   While these projects are often generated from computer graphics,
the lenticular process doesn't inherently rely upon microchips or
computers. But Panasonic has recently released a computer printer
with Windows software that prints animated sequences of images from
computer files onto lenticular sheets the size of credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely how lenticular images are prepared is a closely
guarded secret. Variview did not patent the process because its
founder, Victor Anderson, didn't want to reveal his trade secrets.
The original lenticular cameras expose images to photographic film
through the numerous lenses of a lenticular sheet, which creates an
interleaved image that is ready to develop photographically and
apply to lenticular sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Now a lot of lenticular images start life as three-dimensional
computer models or flat digital photographs, which are processed by
computer and printed on commercial printers.
</P>
<P>
   Not all lenticular images are created equal. The earliest
examples were literally autostereo images: two images that either
gave a parallax perspective on the same image or switched between
two images. Panasonic's motion-image printer takes six discrete
images and prints them in strips beneath lenses.
</P>
<P>
   But advertising-quality lenticular images cram dozens of frames
into a single image. Beneath each lens in a Depthography image, for
example, could be lines from 30 to 50 images. The lenses magnify
each line; together, they form a full-size image.
</P>
<P>
   If the sight of a lenticular picture isn't enough to make you
stop in wonder, the fact that it's made up of that many different
images surely should be.

`SPOONFUL' AUTHOR FINDS FOOD SERVES TO HEAL, NOURISH

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Nina Simonds' research for her latest cookbook began
27 years ago with a nasty stomachache.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was way too yin,'' she says, explaining that her diet was
out of balance according to the Asian concept of yin and yang.
</P>
<P>
   For Americans who treat such maladies by tossing back a couple
of Tums, the idea that the foods she was eating while studying in
China could not only cause an upset stomach but cure it as well
might seem, well, foreign.
</P>
<P>
   But a traditional Chinese physician convinced Simonds that
antacids were not the answer. After a few days of eating more yang
foods such as rice congee, lamb with cinnamon and chicken soup, her
health returned.
</P>
<P>
   The almost immediate relief came as a surprise to a Boston girl
raised on her mother's hardy Jewish cooking _ dishes such as
``schmiggy,'' meatloaf frosted with mashed potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   As Simonds' cookbook, ``A Spoonful of Ginger'' (Knopf, $30),
suggests, food can indeed be both nourishment and medicine. It's a
philosophy that Asians have been practicing for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   And every good Jewish mother knows that chicken soup cures many
an ailment.
</P>
<P>
   Simonds, whose five previous cookbooks include ``Asian Noodles''
and ``Classic Chinese Cuisine,'' was in Phoenix recently for a
conference of the International Association of Culinary
Professionals.
</P>
<P>
   At age 46, she is in the prime of health, she says, feeling
invigorated by a diet that includes much Asian cuisine and a lot of
grilled vegetables and lean meats. She drinks green tea all day.
When her spirits need a lift, she cooks up a batch of chicken soup
with shiitake mushrooms, ginger and miso.
</P>
<P>
   While being interviewed, she sips tea and snacks on a banana.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the body tells us what it needs,'' she says. ``It's
the big picture. It's regimen _ to prevent disease, to lengthen
your life and ensure good health.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Spoonful of Ginger'' is beautifully photographed. Many of
the black-and-white photos were shot during a trip across Asia that
Simonds took last year with her husband, recording company
executive Don Rose, and her editor at Alfred A. Knopf, Judith
Jones. Rose took photos of people in such countries as Malaysia,
Thailand, Laos, China and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes, developed over many years by Simonds and inspired
by Asian home cooking, are assigned to such chapters as Nourishing
Soups (Korean Clampot With Garlic Chives), Seafood (Yin-Yang Shrimp
With Hawthorn Dipping Sauce), Soybeans and Tofu (Fragrant Steamed
Pearl Balls), Poultry: Chicken and Duck (Chile Chicken With
Cashews), the Neutralizers (Wild Mushroom Fried Rice) and Sweet
Flavors (Two-Spice Vanilla Tapioca Pudding).
</P>
<P>
   The last chapter is titled ``The Kitchen Clinic and Herbal
Tonics.'' It provides recipes for teas, tonics and herbal remedies.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a book of gastronomic denial. There are pastries and
pancakes and spicy spareribs. And the recipes are not intimidating
to the Western cook. No grubs. No roasted roaches.
</P>
<P>
   Even the little golden triangles of fried tempeh look inviting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe people will eat food if it's just healthy,''
Simonds says. ``It has to taste good.''
</P>
<P>
   For too many Americans, especially women, food has become an
enemy when it should be a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the eating disorders, people have forgotten how
nurturing it can be,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling out of sorts? Try a Soothing Pear Congee.
</P>
<P>
   Depressed? Nothing boosts the spirits like Baked Black Bean
Shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   Blood pressure soaring? Mix up a tonic of lonicera japonica,
chrysanthemum flower, mulberry leaf, crataegus and cirsium
japonicum.
</P>
<P>
   Simonds advises readers that her cookbook is not intended as a
medical text and that anyone with a health disorder should consult
a qualified health professional.
</P>
<P>
   But when Western medicine fails to cure the common cold, why not
cook up some Grilled Ginger Teriyaki Tuna, a Chinese remedy for
colds and flu?
</P>
<P>
   Simonds and her husband practice what she preaches, leaving them
generally free of illness and feeling energized. Simonds visits
Asia at least once a year, while Rose makes frequent trips to
London, where his company has an office. But they are home in
Salem, Mass., most nights, and try to instill good eating habits in
their 10-year-old son, Jesse.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the boy does not always follow their counsel. Mom concedes
she fixes him macaroni and cheese, and he doesn't like many
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   French fries rule.
</P>
<P>
   But Jesse doesn't eat many meats either _ a bit of chicken now
and then. He has never had a fast-food burger. Because he is
healthy, Simonds doesn't fret.
</P>
<P>
   As a culinary professional, she's often the hit of Jesse's
school. When she's out of the country, she faxes him messages to
share with his classmates. When she's in town, she's in his
classroom, cooking up specialities for holidays and special events.
</P>
<P>
   His school projects often involve the culture and cuisine of
other lands.
</P>
<P>
   Simonds says she enjoys using her special talents to enrich her
son's life.

10 cups water
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 cinnamon sticks
</P>
<P>
   8 slices fresh, unpeeled ginger, about the size of a quarter,

SENATOR SAYS KOSOVO RECONSTRUCTION COULD COST $3 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The pricetag for rebuilding war-torn Kosovo could
go as high as $3 billion, the senator in charge of the subcommittee
dispensing foreign aid said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., whose Senate Appropriations
subcommittee on foreign operations oversees the $12.5 billion
foreign aid budget, told reporters that rehabilitating Kosovo once
the war there ends is just the beginning of a long-term U.S.
relationship with the Balkans. He cited nations such as Albania and
Macedonia, which have borne the brunt of Kosovo's refugee exodus.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how you felt about this war, there isn't any
question that once it's over, we've got a new obligation to a part
of the world we had not previously paid much attention to,''
McConnell said. ``I'm not angry about it. It's a statement of the
obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   McConnell did not put a price on long-term assistance to Albania
and Macedonia. But he estimated the cost of direct relief
assistance to Kosovo at $3 billion ``over a three-to-four year
period.''
</P>
<P>
   He said European nations such as England and Germany should
expect to pick up 75 percent of the cost. But he added that the
cost to the U.S. treasury will be substantial. This year's proposed
$12.5 billion foreign aid budget includes $600 million for aid to
the more than 800,000 ethnic Albanians driven from their homes in
Kosovo by Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any question that's not adequate even
for this year,'' McConnell said. ``I don't think there's anyone who
thinks the refugees are going to be back in Kosovo by next winter
in a position to lead any kind of normal life.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the war ceases and an international force occupies
Kosovo, relief workers will face the task of essentially moving
refugee camps in Albania and Macedonia back into Kosovo, McConnell
said.
</P>
<P>
   With widespread destruction in Kosovo, there is ``no housing to
be in, even if we physically get (refugees) back into their
country,'' he said. ``This is just the beginning. We've got a huge
number of people to care for, and the United States is going to
play a substantial part of that role.''
</P>
<P>
   If Slobodan Milosevic remains in power, McConnell said, he does
not think American foreign aid should go to help Yugoslavia recover
from NATO's massive bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do inside Yugoslavia depends on the what the
government looks like once it's over,'' he said. ``If it's
essentially the same as it is now, my inclination would be to do
nothing.''

THE MOTHER WHO CAME OUT OF THE BASEMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When she said goodbye to her baby girl, Suzanna Tatom was 16,
unwed and on her way back to high school.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't what she wanted. She was simply doing what she was
told. Besides, that's how it was back then. Getting pregnant
brought such shame to your family, you were practically forced to
have an abortion or put your baby up for adoption.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanna gave up her baby.
</P>
<P>
   Five months ago, she and 'Chelle were reunited. That's
important, because now Suzanna can come out of the basement. That's
different from the closet, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The basement is where birth mothers live when they give their
babies up for adoption, where they hide the shame and the anger and
the love they can't own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always loved her, and there's never been a day when I didn't
think about her or pray about her, and I always felt like part of
my heart was missing,'' Suzanna said.
</P>
<P>
   The very thought brings tears to her eyes, the same way the
anger and the lost years bring with them a longing for what might
have been.
</P>
<P>
   After giving her baby up, Suzanna returned to high school and
met Anthony Tatom, who would become her husband of 23 years.
Throughout the years, she said, she and Anthony made inquiries
about her baby. But it wasn't until two years ago _ after her
mother and both of Anthony's parents had died _ that Suzanna
determined she would not live through another birthday without
knowing her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day she passed away, I looked into the mirror and thought
how much I looked like my mom,'' Suzanna remembered. ``Then I
thought that there was someone out there who probably looked like
me.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 25, 10 days before her daughter's 23rd birthday, Suzanna
told Anthony that she was ready, and the couple contacted the
adoption agency. Because of confidentiality guarantees, the agency
would tell them only that 'Chelle lived in Texas. Then they heard
about TxCare, a statewide adoption resource and education
organization.
</P>
<P>
   TxCare located 'Chelle in Denton, and Suzanna narrowed her
whereabouts to the University of North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In November, they met at 'Chelle's boyfriend's apartment near
the campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I've found her and found that she had a good life,
she makes me feel I've enhanced hers,'' Suzanna said. ``So I'm
getting a little closer to forgiving myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzanna Tatom felt a lot of anger for a lot of years. She wishes
that she had been stronger, that she had been assertive enough to
tell her family she wanted to keep her little girl, to say to hell
with what society thinks.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't. She was just a girl herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony is that, back then, society was telling us if we
kept our babies, we were being selfish and didn't love our babies
enough to give them a chance to grow up in a home with parents, and
we couldn't give them enough.''
</P>
<P>
   I've heard that argument before. It's the same one that says
women should have the right to abortions because unwanted babies
become abused babies.
</P>
<P>
   Society is like that. We make up our minds, and our judgment
becomes frozen in place, like ice. Listen to Suzanna, and the ice
runs like water again.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanna Tatom was 16 when she got pregnant, but she always loved
her baby. And even if she were too ashamed to admit it, she was
always a mother _ a good mother.

A TASTE OF THE DARK SIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN MELTON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I think I may have found the perfect dark beer: Diebels,
Germany's No. 1-selling dark beer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brewed since 1878 in Issum, Diebels is a balanced,
dry-malt-flavored nectar that registers a strong note on the palate
but finishes cleanly. It has none of the throaty aftertaste that
most casual beer drinkers find so problematic with most dark beers.
</P>
<P>
   The Diebels brewers make a point of saying it's brewed according
to ``Reinheitsgebot,'' the German purity law. Although it sounds
noble, it's actually an ancient law that prevents other countries
from exporting into the Fatherland, thus creating a monopoly that
keeps the German beer industry thriving. Even though the economic
need for such a rule passed eons ago, the Reinheitsgebot tradition
remains annoying _ which may be the point, come to think of it.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it makes any difference to me, one way or the other. As
long as I can find Diebels at some friendly neighborhood booze
emporium, I'm a happy swiller.
</P>
<P>
   According to its Web site, the family-owned Diebels brewery is
the leading brewer of ``altbier'' in Germany. Since
November/December 1995, (according to the German Association of
Consumer, Market and Sales Research), Diebels has held a share of
more than 60 percent of the German altbier market, which gives
Diebels the highest market share of any German beer.
</P>
<P>
   Whoop-de-doo. All I know is that from time to time, I have to
remind myself that this is a dark beer. I look at the deep, caramel
color and savor the tiny bubbles as I pour it cleanly into a
chilled glass. The head rises majestically, releasing the
brewmaster's art, then settles away quickly.
</P>
<P>
   With each swallow, the taste builds smoothly, with just a tiny
bit of sweetness, followed by the merest hint of malt on the
aftertaste. No doubt about it, this quixotic little brew is a
mystery. That's why it's so easy to have another.
</P>
<P>
   Diebels works very well with food, especially something with a
bite, like a spicy penne arrabbiata: The flavors of the brew and
the pasta dish mingle comfortingly, supportive but not
overwhelming. You may have to drive a little to find Diebels, but
it's worth the trip.

CHORAL COMPOSER FEELS THE DIVINE IN MUSIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Composer Robert Young's success is based on the
principle that less is more.
</P>
<P>
   Although Young has published more than five dozen works, few
have been longer than five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most frequently performed composers in America, Young
arrived at this enviable position by composing in a genre for which
there is much demand and constant need for new material: the short
choral piece.
</P>
<P>
   His latest compositions will be premiered Monday by the Fort
Worth concert choir Schola Cantorum, featuring conductor Gary
Ebensberger, at Bass Performance Hall in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Young, 76, says composing choral music is more than just
churning out four-part settings of poems. On the practical side, he
says he has a deep knowledge of what works for chorus _ and what
doesn't _ from his decades as a choral director at Baylor
University.
</P>
<P>
   But Young says his work reflects a spiritual side, too, arising
from his deep love of poetry and his belief in the ability of music
to take on the presence of God.
</P>
<P>
   Young was born and reared in California. He grew up in the
conservative, evangelical Free Methodist tradition, and he said it
gave him a sense of spirituality but left him feeling socially
isolated as a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music was the one redeeming feature of my life,'' Young said,
remembering his high school years.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had not yet graduated when the Japanese bombed Pearl
Harbor in December 1941, he enlisted in the Marines. Assigned to
Honolulu in anticipation of another attack, he spent most of the
war in relative safety.
</P>
<P>
   His first experience as a conductor came when, because of his
interest in music, he was recruited to direct the music at a small
Baptist church in Honolulu. He went to the library, checked out a
book titled ``The Eloquent Baton,'' and learned basic conducting
patterns before beginning to work with a small choir.
</P>
<P>
   After being discharged from the Marine Corps in 1945, Young
applied to Oberlin College. He was accepted in spite of a poor high
school record. Midway through the first semester, he learned that
his admission had been a bureaucratic error. By mistake, his high
school had sent the impressive transcript of another student named
Robert Young.
</P>
<P>
   He was dismissed from Oberlin despite having a good record
there. A sympathetic music teacher recommended him to Otterbein
College, also in Ohio, where Young graduated with an excellent
academic record before going on to perform distinguished graduate
work at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., and at the
University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   During overseas study in Britain, Young researched his doctoral
thesis on Baptist hymnody of 1612-1800 and sang in the Royal Choral
Society in London. While singing with that ensemble during a
performance of Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius at the Royal Albert
Hall under conductor Malcolm Sargent, Young had one of his most
overwhelming experiences of what he calls ``the God presence'' in
music.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining ``the God presence'' in music is difficult, Young
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't be analyzed,'' he says. ``There's something else
there.''
</P>
<P>
   He cites, as specific and obvious examples, the Ninth Variation
from Elgar's ``Enigma'' Variations, the final three symphonies of
Mozart, the ``Agnus Dei'' of Palestrina's ``Missa Brevis'' and the
slow movement of Brahms' Piano Concerto No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, three years after completing his doctorate at USC,
Young accepted a position as choral director at Baylor. Shortly
after arriving on the Waco campus, he organized a select 16-voice
chamber choir that performed in the resonant marble lobby of the
Armstrong Browning Library, a building that houses this
hemisphere's most significant collection of memorabilia of Robert
and Elizabeth Barrett Browning.
</P>
<P>
   This ensemble provided the inspiration and the laboratory for
Young's exploration of choral composition, and his style was
largely inspired by the group. His music is overwhelmingly tonal,
colored by the chromaticism, occasional dissonance and close
harmonies that give modern choral music its richness. Although it
reflects the high level of expertise of the Baylor Chamber Singers,
it is music that a typical community, church or school choir can
conquer with a little work. Dissonances are carefully prepared and
approached, and each separate voice part is written to exploit the
range in which it sounds best.
</P>
<P>
   Although he never had formal composition lessons, Young relies
on a solid background in music theory and on information he gained
in classes with composer Halsey Stevens at USC. Beyond
craftsmanship, he relies on inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could mill these things out by formula,'' he says, ``but I
live with a poem a long time, until I identify with it. I go
slowly. ... It's not something you can put in a test tube.''
</P>
<P>
   No one goes into composition for the money, but Young's short
choral pieces have become notably successful; selection of some of
his works as required pieces at statewide high school events has
guaranteed heavy sales. Concert choirs in Albany, N.Y., and
Savannah, Ga., as well as Schola Cantorum in Fort Worth, have been
particularly notable advocates of Young's music, and a recording by
the Albany choir led to Young's selection in 1997 to compose a new
anthem for the installation of a high official of the Episcopal
Church at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York. Young,
now an Episcopalian, had the privilege of receiving Holy Communion
at the New York church during the performance of his work.
</P>
<P>
   Young generally earns between $300 and $1,200 for a commissioned
work. Grateful for the many performances of his works by Schola
Cantorum through the years, he declined to accept a fee when
conductor Ebensberger approached him about composing a piece.
</P>
<P>
   The result of the commission is a short, three-page choral song
setting the poem ``Somewhere'' by Christina Rossetti, a
19th-century British romantic poet who has figured prominently in
Young's works through the years.
</P>
<P>
   Young officially retired in 1993 after 30 years as a full-time
faculty member, including one year of service as acting dean of the
Baylor School of Music in 1987-88. Currently, Young teaches one or
two classes in choral conducting every semester, directs the music
at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Waco and spends a lot of time
composing at the house he shares with his wife, Betty, a counselor
at Midway High School in Waco.

WHY POP STARS PLAY THE BASS INSTEAD OF DALLAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, living in Fort Worth and wanting to hear well-known
musicians often meant making the hike over to Dallas venues such as
Starplex or the Music Hall at Fair Park. But the opening of Nancy
Lee and Perry R. Bass Performance Hall has reversed the flow of
concert-going traffic between Fort Worth and Big D _ at least
partially.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous acts _ including bluesmen Jonny Lang and Keb' Mo' and
jazz vocalist Randy Crawford _ have played the Bass instead of a
Dallas location, and traditional Irish heroes The Chieftains played
Fort Worth for the first time after the Bass opened.
</P>
<P>
   But the big news was Lyle Lovett's three sold-out nights in
November. Lovett had not played Fort Worth since 1992, and this
time he drew more than twice as many people as he had then.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were bidding against several venues in Dallas, and it came
down to Lyle wanting to give it a try,'' said Jerry Thompson,
president of Promoterline/Caravan of Dreams. ``A lot of acts are
willing to play a smaller venue to give the fans a nicer
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it set a precedent; it changed the perception of the
ticket-buying public. People are more willing to drive here than to
other venues and pay a higher ticket price because they're willing
to pay for the amenities and the environment. The phone is ringing
off the hook with agents wanting to bring their acts here. The
hall's become a major player.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lovett shows' success led to other performers playing at the
Bass.
</P>
<P>
   ``My artists love the building,'' said Garry Buck, vice
president of Monterey International, a division of the giant
Monterey Peninsula Artists booking agency, which books Lovett, Lang
and Keb' Mo.' ``It's great to have a building of this quality and
have a rock act able to play it. Keb' Mo' called me personally
after the show and told me he wanted to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Bass Hall's popularity is due to its reputation as an
artist-friendly hall with great acoustics as well as its
fan-friendly location, with restaurants and shops within easy
walking distance.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bongiovani, editor of ``Pollstar,'' says there is also a
certain curiosity factor at work: The hall is, after all, only a
year old. But he adds that the hall's good rep certainly helps
ensure long-term interest.

 &HT;    Name game burns `Frasier'
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's an established natural law of television that the Crane men
of ``Frasier'' are funniest when they're not gettin' any. Frasier
(Kelsey Grammer) sputters, Martin (John Mahoney) grouses and Niles
(David Hyde Pierce) twists himself into a human paper clip.
</P>
<P>
   But as tonight's season finale proves, they can be funny when
they're gettin' plenty, as well.
</P>
<P>
   That's the unlikely scenario for this one-hour special,
sandwiched between a one-hour ``Friends'' finale and the season's
curtain for ``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   The opening finds Frasier back with Faye (Amy Brenneman), the
woman for whom the whole family pretended to be Jewish in the
Christmas episode. Marty is having sleep-overs with a lady friend,
and Daphne is still smitten with her fiance Donnie (does anyone
else not trust this lovey-dovey divorce lawyer, though?). That
leaves Niles alone again, naturally.
</P>
<P>
   But that changes when Niles takes up with Kit, a free-spirited
waitress at the Cafe Nervosa. Before you can sing that old Warren
Zevon song ``Poor Poor Pitiful Me'' (``She put me through some
changes, boy/ Kinda like a Waring blender''), Niles is smitten with
Kit and he's become a bohemian party boy, ludicrous in black
leather instead of his usual Armani.
</P>
<P>
   Frasier, meanwhile, keeps slipping up and calling Faye
``Cassandra,'' which turns out to be the name of the station
promotions director memorably played by Viriginia Madsen in the
Valentine's Day episode.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, none of this bodes well for long-term fulfillment for
the Cranes, which is as it should be.
</P>
<P>
   Even a not-so-hot episode of ``Frasier'' is better than the best
work of most other sitcoms; like ``Seinfeld,'' these guys set the
bar very high for themselves. And stretching any sitcom to one hour
nearly always poses problems with pacing and with not quite enough
laughs over a little too long a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   So as ``Frasier'' heads into a summer of reruns, here's a tip:
Even if it's too hot to sweat, when they re-run that Christmas
episode, don't miss it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   9 tonight on NBC.

 &HT;    Fans find creative ways to make 'Star Wars' opening a holiday
 &HT;    By Bob Longino and Matt Aldag
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was a day that in the minds of many ``Star Wars''
fanatics will live in infamy.
</P>
<P>
   Army Pfc. Dustin Sayes, 22, stationed at Fort Benning, felt so
strongly about Wednesday's opening of George Lucas' ``Star Wars:
Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' that he spent three months
fashioning himself a Darth Maul costume.
</P>
<P>
   So there he stood Wednesday afternoon outside United Artists'
Perimeter Pointe theater _ all gussied up from horned head to
booted toe as ``Phantom Menace's'' red-and-black poster boy for the
Dark Side.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so `Star Wars.' It had the right amount of phrases from
the original,'' said Sayes, who drove to Perimeter Pointe on
Tuesday night, watched the first post-midnight screening early
Wednesday, slept in his car and was up bright and early for the
theater's 10 a.m. Wednesday showing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am gonna go see it a few more times,'' Sayes said. ``It is
one of those movies that is definitely re-watchable _ like the
originals.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of metro Atlantans saw the film Wednesday, many at
midnight screenings but some during daytime showings, playing what
the Internet has dubbed ``Wookiee Hooky'' from work or school (one
employment agency generously estimated that 2.2 million Americans
would skip work or schedule time off Wednesday to see the film).
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of seats were available for many of the daytime showings.
After all, ``Phantom Menace'' is playing at about 35 theaters in
metro Atlanta and North Georgia and more than 2,900 more across the
country. But the film also appeared to be on track to set a one-day
box office record, topping the $26.1 million tally set by ``The
Lost World: Jurassic Park'' in 1997. While Exhibitor Relations in
Los Angeles said it would not release initial dollar figures until
today, some Hollywood executives have predicted the film could
bring in as much as $45 million for its first day. Some expect it
will make up to $140 its first weekend, another record.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how many tickets are sold, the $115 million ``Phantom
Menace'' is already a moneymaker because of advertising tie-ins.
For example, Hasbro, one of 75 licensees, paid nearly $400 million
for toy rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was frantic to get here because my dad took me to the first
showing of `The Return of the Jedi' and I wanted to do the same
thing for my stepson,'' said Kamaria Johnson, 25, who saw the film
with her husband, Leonard, 38, and his son Christopher, 9, at AMC's
North DeKalb Mall 16. ``I don't think it has to be good. It's about
recapturing the awe I had (with the earlier films) as a child or a
senior in high school.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a drubbing by several national film critics, many local
moviegoers gave ``Phantom Menace'' a spirited thumbs up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked it a lot and can't wait for `Episode II,' '' said
Jason Awcock, 23, of Suwanee (Ga.), who emerged from seeing the
film with a big grin on his face at Regal Cinemas' new Hollywood 24
megaplex.
</P>
<P>
   But other ``Star Wars'' fanatics weren't exactly charmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I camped out for tickets for seven hours, and now I guess I
wish I hadn't,'' said Paul Herris, 26, of Atlanta. ``I was
disappointed. I was expecting a lot more. I thought George Lucas
would write it more maturely.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Phantom Menace'' has been the kind of cultural Force
most Hollywood movies never achieve.
</P>
<P>
   So far, fans nationwide have purchased a record 250,000 tickets
for the film off the Internet and online kiosks, according to
Atlanta's National Data Corporation. Other fans waited in lines for
hours or days _ and, outside Mann's Chinese Theatrer in Los
Angeles, sometimes weeks _ for tickets. One group of fans, led by
Chris Petersen, 29, of Jonesboro (Ga.), camped out in blow-up
rubber Darth Maul and Queen Amidala chairs for about 30 hours at
Perimeter Pointe to await that theater's first showing. They
already had tickets, but wanted to commemorate the original ``Star
Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad took me 22 years ago to the first film,'' said
Petersen, who returned the favor by taking his dad Tom Petersen, of
Fayetteville (Ga.), to a Wednesday showing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the things I'm most excited about,'' said
Petersen, who took off work as a computer staffer for Clayton
County (Ga.) public schools in order to see the movie. ``He took me
and now I get to take him.''
</P>
<P>
   Some businesses, such as Atlanta's The Headline Group and
Macquarium declared the opening a holiday, both buying tickets for
all their employees.
</P>
<P>
   In Fayetteville, Garry Brannon of College Park (Ga.) has bought
four tickets for one of the Thursday night showings at the
Tinseltown 17 and will leave work at B&AMP;B Graphics early to take his
wife, Darla, and two kids to see ``Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're shutting the plant down,'' Brannon joked. He and Darla,
after all, aren't just the owners, they're the entire B&AMP;B staff.

 By CLAIRE POOLE 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    HOUSTON _ Luis Cantu is considered a savior around the halls of
Reforma, a daily newspaper in Mexico City. When their computers
crash, reporters call him to get their PCs up and running again so
they can make their deadlines.
 &HT;    But when he is unable to fix the problem, Cantu knows who to
call: Dell Computer Corp., which sold Reforma its machines. If a
system cannot be set right over the telephone, the company will
dispatch a technician to the newspaper within 48 hours. Cantu is so
impressed with the computer maker, he's looking to buy another 60
to 70 PCs from the company this year as a backup in case of a
potential Y2K meltdown. Mural, a new sister paper in Guadalajara,
is 100 percent stocked with Dell computers, and El Norte in
Monterrey is moving in that direction. ``Were totally happy with
Dell,'' he says. ``They're fast, efficient and a good price.''
 &HT;    Reforma is just the beginning. The US$18 billion (sales)
computer maker based outside Austin, Texas, has recently targeted
Latin America as its next big growth region. Over the past year,
Dell has opened offices in Bogota and Santiago, joining an existing
office in Mexico City. Manufacturing facilities in Brazil are
nearly complete and a new Spanish-language web site that will allow
Latin American consumers to buy custom-made PCs over the Internet
is coming online soon. ``They're ramping up in the region and
they're investing,'' says Loren Loverde, research manager at IDC
Latin America, a unit of computer research firm International Data
Corp., who recently met with the company. ``They've clearly got a
new focus there.''
 &HT;    Until now, Dell has shown only a half-hearted commitment to the
region. IDC ranks Dell as the fifth-largest computer maker in Latin
America last year with only 2.9 percent of the $6.82 billion PC
market, trailing behind such competitors as Compaq Computer,
International Business Machines, Hewlett-Packard and Acer. But
that's certainly an improvement over last year, when it ranked a
dismal 14th place with only 1.5 percent of the market. Dell wont
divulge market share figures or confirm IDCs numbers.
 &HT;    The first forays into the region began around seven years ago;
Dell even opened a local configuration facility outside Mexico City
in 1993. But about a year later, it closed the plant _ as well as
several others around the world _ when it moved to a more
centralized manufacturing model focused around its Texas and
Ireland facilities. Mexico's peso devaluation and its domino effect
across the region certainly didn't whet Dells appetite, so it
turned its sights eastward, opening up a facility in Malaysia to
serve the Asia/Pacific market, including Japan, and in China to
serve that vast, fast-growing country.
 &HT;    Dell didn't desert Latin America entirely, however. The company
continued to sell computers in the region through local
distributors. But it later dumped them for the direct model that
made the company famous and rich in the United States, in which
customers call a toll-free number, select and configure the PC and
then have the system shipped to their home or business. A Mexico
City office was launched four years ago to serve corporate clients
but customers in other countries still had to call its Texas
headquarters. In 1996, Dell also began offering a Spanish-language
version of its U.S. web site that allowed Latin Americans to order
preconfigured systems over the Internet. Brazil delayed. Not until
last year did Dell start getting serious about making a mark
farther south.
 &HT;    In August, the company announced that it would open a 123-acre
manufacturing and customer center in Alvorada, Brazil _ in the
state of Rio Grande do Sul near Porto Alegre _ to serve the entire
Mercosur market, including Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Chile.
Total investment: $125 million. ``The expansion into Brazil is a
significant milestone for Dell as we continue our global
expansion,'' Dell's vice chairman, Kevin Rollins, said at the time.
 &HT;    Unfortunate timing, to say the least. Five months later, Brazil
devalued the real, and the country's booming consumer-driven
economy quickly crumbled under the weight of high interest rates.
 &HT;    Since then, Dell has been tight-lipped about when the Brazilian
facility will begin operating. An August press release said it
would open in 1999. Daryl Robertson, who helped Dell break into
Asia and Australia before becoming vice president of Dell Latin
America, will only say that Dell plans to be producing and
delivering product in Brazil ``within a year.''
 &HT;    ``Brazil is a fairly turbulent market right now,'' he says.
``The devaluation and the economic problems are a concern to all
multinationals operating here, and we're monitoring the situation
closely and hope for the stabilization of the real and the recovery
of the economy.''
 &HT;    But Robertson denies that Dell has recoiled since the
devaluation. ``Were continuing with our plan,'' he says repeatedly.
``We regard Brazil as a strategic market long term and we're
committed to our expansion there as a key element in Dell's
globalization strategy.'' Sources outside the company say Dell is
already producing a limited number of systems at a temporary
facility in Brazil. An operator at Dells U.S. call-in system says
the permanent facility should be open and fully operational later
this spring.
 &HT;    In the meantime, Dell has been putting the finishing touches on
its new Latin American online store, which was expected to go live
during the second quarter. Until now, consumers in Latin America
could only buy standard systems over the Internet because of the
difficulty of calculating shipping charges and customs duties based
on the weight of the peripherals and their features. If Latin
American customers wanted a special configuration, they had to pick
up the telephone and call Dell's Texas headquarters. Now they will
be able to order any system they want, configured any way they
want, all in an automated process over the web.
 &HT;    ``We had a lot of orders from folks in Latin America who would
go to our U.S. web site and say, `Hey, why don't you have a site
tailored to our needs?''' says Chris Hinkle, Dell's manager of
Latin America Online, who set up the company's online store in
Japan before working on the Latin American version. ``(This) will
allow customers to go in and pick the product they want at the
exact configuration they want.''
 &HT;    Being able to configure their own systems with the latest,
greatest technology will be new for many Latin Americans, who have
been forced to travel to the United States to buy what they wanted
or rely on whatever computer retailers had in stock _ which, in
many cases, meant older, outdated hardware and peripherals when
faster and larger models were available. Indeed, when Intel
introduced the Pentium II processor in April 1998, it took Latin
American resellers almost four months to push the slower computers
out the door before they could begin to sell the newest machines.
``Whatever the distributors bought, that's the product they're
pushing,'' says Sylvia Acevedo, Dell's director of online and
marketing for Latin America who worked with Hinkle on building the
web site. ``Dealing directly with us, you can order the latest in
technology.''
 &HT;    After Latin American customers place their orders, the computers
will be assembled at Dell's manufacturing facility in Texas and
shipped out. Once they reach their destination, consumers can
either pick them up at customs and pay all the duties themselves _
or, for a small fee, allow Dell to arrange for a local logistics
provider to pay all the duties and fees and deliver the system to
their door.
 &HT;    If they have a problem with their new system, Latin American
customers will be able to call a toll-free number and a technician
will walk them through it. If the problem can't be fixed over the
telephone, Dell will send a trained technician to their home or
office within 48 hours. All this is free for the first year. After
that, Dell offers an extended warranty through the second and third
year for a nominal fee.
 &HT;    Dell plans to launch future features to its Latin American web
site that Americans are familiar with in the United States: A way
to check the status of your order _ whether its being assembled,
processed or shipped _ in real time; ``Ask Dudley,'' which allows
the user to pose a question to its ``virtual technician'' and get a
response; and the ability to download file drivers, which allow the
computer to communicate with different peripherals, such as
printers.
 &HT;    Dell's online initiative sounds great. There's only one problem:
too few eyeballs. According to Boston-based research firm the
Yankee Group, there are only 2.5 million active Internet accounts
in Latin America, making the region home to fewer than 3 percent of
the world's web users due to low PC penetration, poor
infrastructure, high tariffs and insufficient local content.
 &HT;    The Yankee Group expects the situation to change, however, as
markets become fully deregulated, tariffs fall, infrastructure
improves and local content becomes more abundant. Once that
happens, the potential Internet market in the region could balloon
to 90 million users, according to one estimate.
 &HT;    When Internet penetration does improve in the region, will Latin
Americans buy their computers over the Internet? Acevedo, a
first-generation Mexican-American and veteran of Apple Computer and
IBM, believes they will. ``What we've found is really innovative
and early adopters of technology,'' she says. ``They'll fly to
Miami or Houston or McAllen or Los Angeles or ask someone who's
going there to buy them the latest technology. With our online
store, you won't have to do that.''
 &HT;    Dell recently began offering its Latin American corporate
clients something called Premier Pages, customized web sites that
allow them to review their computer-buying history and order new
systems as needed. Dell has set up such pages for 1,500 companies
around the world, including Ford Motor Co., Pricewaterhouse-Coopers
and Boeing, which is said to have ordered 1,000 Dell computers in
one week through the service.
 &HT;    Since launching the Spanish-language version of Premier Page at
the end of last year, Dell has already signed up 40 companies in
Latin America, including such multinationals as Ford, Motorola and
Northern Telecom. Reforma may be next. Cantu says he's working with
a Dell representative in Mexico City to set up the newspaper's own
``Premier Pagina.'' Dell plans to add a Portuguese version later
this year.
 &HT;    Can Dell's direct approach work in Latin America? IDC's Loverde
thinks so. ``A lot of people have expressed doubts about a number
of aspects to the direct appoach: service, timing, Latin culture,''
he says. ``But I think that the culture is changing, and Latins are
going to open up to purchasing on the web.''
 &HT;    Years of globetrotting have convinced Dell's Robertson that his
company's business model trumps local culture. ``Customers want the
same thing worldwide: They want a high-quality product, they want
low prices and they want good service,'' he says. ``We've done that
in Europe, we've done that in Asia, we're doing it now in China,
and we're going to do it in Latin America as well.''
 &HT;    The only question is whether this time the build-to-suit
computer maker is here to stay.

NOVELS HAUNTED BY ACTORS' FACES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Does an enduringly successful movie or television mini-series of
a novel determine our perception of a compelling fictional
character? Are these imagined people forever more perceived as
different from what their creators might have intended?
</P>
<P>
   When readers sit down with ``Hannibal,'' the sequel to ``The
Silence of the Lambs,'' will they see in their minds Anthony
Hopkins and Jodie Foster? If they do, is that a plus or minus for
the reader and the writer who created the character in the first
place? Moreover, can a great actor steal a great character from the
writer?
</P>
<P>
   These questions are prompted by the forthcoming publication of
Thomas Harris' ``Hannibal'' (Delacorte Press) and Martin Cruz
Smith's just-published ``Havana Bay'' (Random House) in which the
ever complex and evolving Russian detective Arkady Renko from
``Gorky Park'' returns for the fourth time.
</P>
<P>
   Generally such questions can only be raised in literary
thrillers because the characters do return in book after book, and
their fictional persons have unconscious internal stories that not
only change and grow with each book but also are intricate enough
to force a collaboration between the writer and the reader. Readers
have to use the author's hints to create part of the novel for
themselves, rather like connecting dots to get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Another towering book character in serious thrillers _ one to
match the serial killer Hannibal Lecter and the FBI agent Clarice
Starling and Renko _ was George Smiley, now retired, probably the
greatest creation of John le Carre, the master literary spy
novelist. I say Smiley is retired because Sir Alec Guinness'
portrayal in the 1980 mini-series ``Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy''
was such a triumph that the author said the actor ``took the
character away from me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Writing Smiley after Smiley-through-Guinness had entered the
public domain was very difficult,'' le Carre has said. ``In a sense
his screen success blew it for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith had no such problem with Renko. While ``The Silence of the
Lambs'' won five Academy Awards in 1991, the screen version of the
best-selling ``Gorky Park'' in 1983 was unmemorable, and the image
of William Hurt, who played him in the movie, certainly doesn't pop
to mind when one sits down with a Renko novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that Arkady is almost safe even from me, let alone
from an actor at this point,'' Smith said. ``Renko seems to really
exist. He's braver and more intelligent that I am. He always sort
of does things reluctantly but he does them. He doesn't want to go
into dark rooms unnecessarily.'' The writer said that in a way
Renko was fortunate that there is no Hopkins in his life, but that
he, as author, was mindful that a great movie would strengthen book
sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smiley was intelligent and intriguing and fun, and he and le
Carre were real intellectuals,'' Smith said. ``Arkady conceivably
could be happy as a schoolteacher. The careful reader knows more
about him than he knows about himself.'' True enough, but in this
latest novel Renko is shaken up, at the end of his rope, still
``trying to fix himself in the universe, as if he has some control
of where he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris' sequel will go on sale on June 8, with a first printing
of 1.2 million copies, up from the 500,000 originally planned. It
is expected to be the big novel of the summer and there is a frenzy
in Hollywood to get the rights to produce the movie, and bring back
Hopkins as Lecter and Ms. Foster as Starling, Jonathan Demme as
director and Ted Talley as scriptwriter.
</P>
<P>
   Lecter, in all his evilness, has become almost a cult figure,
and to his fans the idea of anyone but Hopkins playing him is
unthinkable if not laughable. Such actor-character identification
is not uncommon. To many James Bond movie addicts there was only
Sean Connery. Nonetheless, all the post-Connery Bond movies
succeeded, probably because Bond, unlike Lecter and Renko and
Smiley, is a cartoon character.
</P>
<P>
   Harris never gives an interview. ( Smith happens to be a friend
of mine.) But Harris' publisher and editor, Carole Baron, said that
any impact that Hopkins and Ms. Foster would have on the reader of
the novel was not important to him. Harris never saw the movie in
the theater or on video, she said. ``He may have, I think he did,
recently catch part of it on television,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was thrilled the movie won all the prizes and would be
thrilled if Hopkins did it again,'' Ms. Baron said. ``He's a
realist, a very pragmatic, thoughtful person. We discussed the le
Carre comment and the issue of whether the character was co-opted
by the actor. Tom is confident that what he wrote is his, and the
rest of the world can do what it does about the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert B. Parker writes a different sort of action best seller
for Putnam's, with a more straightforward story, less complex than
the literary thrillers. Each is a textbook model of linear
narrative. The main character in his continuing troupe is Spenser,
private detective, one of the great creations of the genre, who has
appeared in 25 books. Spenser was played by Robert Urich on
television in 1985 although it was the actor Robert Mitchum he had
in mind when he started writing the books. There are plans for A&AMP;E
to produce five new Spenser movies for television, with Joe
Mantegna as the detective.
</P>
<P>
   Spenser is more violent and more complicated in the books than
on television, but also funnier, Parker said, adding, ``People say
to me, `I can't imagine anyone but Robert Urich when I read your
books,' but I cannot control beyond a certain point what people
imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere George Smiley is growing roses. His admirers wished
that his wife would stop fooling around with other men, but le
Carre would not grant him that domestic peace. We recently learned
that Arkady Renko had been rooting around in Havana since we last
encountered him in Moscow in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But what has Lecter been doing since last seen in 1988 as he was
off to have a friend for dinner with a fine Chianti? His publisher,
Ms. Baron, would only say that he ``was pursuing his interests.'' A
scary thought.
</P>
<P>
   As for the author? ``He doesn't repeat himself. He takes the
whole story to new levels, and explores things of his own
imagination.'' That crafted, enigmatic answer will have to do until
next month.

SABRES SING A TEAM SONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ It wasn't a scream in the ear, more a tap on the
shoulder. Psst, the Buffalo Sabres quietly insisted on the eve of
their playoff series against the Bruins, we're not just Dominik and
the Dominos.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that they begrudged their resident rock star, Dominik
Hasek, any of his overwhelming acclaim. ``He's the best goaltender
in the world,'' said center Curtis Brown. ``Maybe the best player
in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just that the public obsession with Hasek tended to obscure
the supporting cast, dismissed as so many Sabre spear-carriers.
``We have other things going on this team,'' coach Lindy Ruff
maintained.
</P>
<P>
   Do they ever. That's why the Sabres are going to the Eastern
Conference finals for the second straight year, having completed a
six-game burial of the Bruins with a 3-2 victory Tuesday night in
which all their considerable qualities _ resounding forechecking,
startling speed, aggressive defense, and yes, pretty decent
goaltending _ were on display. The undeniable conclusion was that
Hasek may be the major element in the Sabres' equation of success,
but he gets plenty of help. Anonymous help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just waiting for people to start listening to us,'' said
center Michael Peca, the team captain. ``We never steer from the
fact that Dom is No. 1 here. But we've got a lot of guys with pride
and character who come to play. As long as we know that in this
room, it's irrelevant what anyone else says.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the word spread far beyond the Sabres' locker stalls _
right into the Bruins' souls. Hasek's magic was needed only in
spurts; for much of the series, Bruins goalie Byron Dafoe was at
least his equal. Everywhere else, the Sabres were clearly superior,
and they were on the Bruins like an anvil most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some hidden talent that hasn't been exposed,'' Ruff
said in the wake of the clincher, which followed up a four-game
first-round sweep of Ottawa and created a Queen Elizabeth Way
conference finals against Toronto, 90 minutes and one international
border up the road. ``Now it's starting to get exposed. Dom is the
glue that holds us together, gives us a lot of confidence. But I
can't say enough about the Peca-(Dixon) Ward-(Vaclav) Varada line.
Curtis Brown played great. (Wayne) Primeau, (Erik) Rasmussen, the
timely scoring we got without (Miroslav) Satan.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Sabres managed to rattle the Bruins even without
their lone 40-goal scorer, Satan, sidelined for the series with a
deep ankle bruise. In his absence, all the Buffalo soldiers
contributed.
</P>
<P>
   Peca in particular was a revelation. Renowned as the NHL's
premier defensive forward, he showed his 27 regular-season goals
were no accident as he tied Brown for the team lead in series
scoring with three goals and two assists. Beyond that, he, Ward,
and Varada harassed Boston's top line, anchored by center Jason
Allison, to the point of virtual invisibility. ``Our offensive
checking line,'' Ruff called the trio.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and Primeau were two other unheralded two-way factors. And
even though a couple of Buffalo's subsidiary scoring threats, Stu
Barnes and Geoff Sanderson, didn't hit the net, their speed and
relentlessness created havoc for the Bruins and opened the way for
their colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of our strengths,'' said Brown, ``because the
opposition doesn't know who to cover some nights.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense was a marvel, too. Jay McKee and Rhett Warrener kept
Hasek's turf essentially free of debris. Alexei Zhitnik (one goal,
four assists) and Jason Woolley (two goals, three assists) not only
were attentive in their own end but provided the pinching in the
Boston zone Ruff considered vital to make up for the lack of
sustained offense.
</P>
<P>
   And Zhitnik and Peca led an attack that smothered the Bruins
with concussive checking, even if Boston coach Pat Burns, relying
on his policeman's background, did decry Buffalo's behavior as
criminal, a futile effort to create a diversion and influence the
officiating.
</P>
<P>
   In the immediate aftermath of their triumph, the Sabres were
relatively subdued. That's because they have merely equaled last
season's achievement, when they lost to the Washington Capitals in
six games in the Eastern finals. Now they regard the job as only
half done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to win more now,'' said Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? Last spring, Hasek was considered the Sabres' one
and only weapon. This time they have the domino effect going for
them.

 Por CLAIRE POOLE 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    HOUSTON _ En el diario mexicano Reforma, Luis Cantu es un heroe.
Cuando las computadoras del periodico dejan de funcionar, los
reporteros lo llaman para que repare el problema y poder entregar
sus articulos a tiempo.
 &HT;    Pero cuando no encuentra la solucion, Cantu llama a Dell
Computer, que le vendio las maquinas a Reforma. Si no se logra
encontrar la solucion del problema por telefono, la compania envia
un tecnico al periodico en 48 horas. Cantu esta tan contento con el
trato que recibe de Dell que piensa comprarle otras 60 o 70 PC este
ano para crear un sistema de respaldo en caso que el problema
informatico del ano 2000 cause una catastrofe. Todas las
computadoras de Mural, un periodico de la misma compania en
Guadalajara, son Dell, y El Norte de Monterrey va por el mismo
rumbo. ``Estamos muy felices con Dell,'' dice Cantu. ``Son rapidos
y eficientes, y dan buenos precios.''
 &HT;    Reforma es solo el comienzo. America Latina es la nueva etapa
del crecimiento del fabricante de PC con sede en Austin, Texas, y
ventas de US$18.000 millones. El ano pasado, Dell abrio oficinas en
Bogota y Santiago. Ya tenia una en Ciudad de Mexico. En Brasil las
instalaciones de manufactura estan casi terminadas y pronto se
inaugurara una pagina electronica que permitira a los consumidores
latinoamericanos comprar computadoras a traves de la Internet.
``Estan invirtiendo fuerte en la region,'' dice Loren Loverde,
gerente de investigaciones de IDC Latin America, una unidad de
International Data Corp., firma de investigacion de informatica,
que recientemente se reunio con la compania. ``Es evidente que se
concentran en America Latina.''
 &HT;    Pero hasta ahora Dell solo ha mostrado un interes parcial por la
region. IDC clasifico a Dell como el quinto fabricante de
computadoras en America Latina el ano pasado, con solo el 2,9 por
ciento de ese mercado de US$6.820 millones, a la zaga de
competidores como Compaq Computer, International Business
Machines., Hewlett-Packard y Acer. Pero ese puesto es muy superior
al del ano pasado, cuando Dell quedo en un triste decimocuarto
lugar con solo el 1,5 por ciento del mercado. (Dell no divulgo
cifras de participacion de mercado ni confirmo los datos de IDC.)
 &HT;    Las primeras incursiones de Dell en la region tuvieron lugar
hace unos siete anos. Incluso abrio una planta de ensamblaje en la
Ciudad de Mexico en 1993. Pero un ano despues cerro la planta,
ademas de otras en varios paises, cuando adopto un modelo de
ensamblaje mas centralizado, concentrando en sus fabricas de Texas
e Irlanda. La devaluacion del peso mexicano y el efecto tequila
hicieron que Dell desviara la mirada hacia el este: abrio una
fabrica en Malasia para el mercado Asia/Pacifico, abarcando a
Japon, y en China para abastecer ese mercado enorme.
 &HT;    Pero Dell no abandono del todo a Latinoamerica y siguio
vendiendo PC a traves de distribuidores locales. Mas tarde opto por
el sistema directo, en que los clientes llaman por telefono,
seleccionan y configuran la PC y la reciben por correo, un sistema
que ha generado grandes ganancias y fama a la empresa en Estados
Unidos. Hace cuatro anos Dell inauguro en la Ciudad de Mexico una
oficina para atender a clientes empresariales, pero los clientes de
otros paises tenian que llamar a la sede de Texas. En 1996, Dell
creo una version en espanol de su pagina en la Web para que los
latinoamericanos pudieran pedir sistemas a traves de la Internet.
 &HT;    Pero fue el ano pasado cuando Dell decidio moverse en serio
hacia el sur. En agosto, la compania anuncio que abriria un centro
de manufactura y atencion al cliente de 50 hectareas en Alvorada,
en el estado brasileno de Rio Grande do Sul, cerca de Porto Alegre,
para atender a todo el Mercosur. La inversion total fue de 125
millones de reales. ``La expansion en Brasil es un paso importante
de la expansion internacional de Dell,'' dijo en ese momento Kevin
Rollins, vicepresidente del directorio de la firma.
 &HT;    El momento no fue el mejor. Cinco meses despues, Brasil devaluo
el real y la floreciente economia se desplomo bajo el peso de las
elevadas tasas de interes. Desde entonces, Dell no ha revelado
cuando comenzara a operar la planta de Brasil. Un comunicado de
prensa de agosto decia que abriria este ano. Daryl Robertson, que
ayudo a Dell a entrar en Asia y Australia antes de ocupar el puesto
de vicepresidente de Dell Latin America, se limito a decir que la
empresa planea producir y entregar productos en Brasil ``dentro de
un ano.'' Agrega que Brasil ``es un mercado muy turbulento en estos
momentos. La devaluacion y los problemas economicos causan
inquietud en todas las multinacionales en Brasil; seguimos la
situacion muy de cerca y esperamos que el real se estabilice y la
economia se recupere.''
 &HT;    Pero Robertson niega que Dell haya retrocedido desde la
devaluacion. ``Seguimos adelante con nuestro plan,'' reitera.
``Consideramos a Brasil un mercado estrategico a largo plazo y
vemos nuestra expansion en ese pais como un elemento clave de la
estrategia de internacionalizacion de Dell.''
 &HT;    Fuentes ajenas a la Dell afirman que la empresa ya produce una
cantidad limitada de sistemas en una instalacion temporal en
Brasil. Una operadora del centro telefonico de Dell en Estados
Unidos dijo se habia fijado para mayo la entrada en operacion de
una instalacion permanente.
 &HT;    Entretanto, Dell le daba los toques finales a su nueva tienda
latinoamericana en linea, que debe abrir en el segundo trimestre
del ano. Hasta ahora, los consumidores latinoamericanos solo podian
comprar sistemas estandar a traves de la Internet debido a la
dificultad de calcular los costos de envio y los aranceles
basandose en el peso de los equipos. Si un cliente latinoamericano
queria una configuracion especial, tenia que llamar por telefono a
la sede de Dell en Texas. Ahora podran pedir el sistema que
quieran, configurado como lo deseen, mediante un proceso
automatizado en la Web.
 &HT;    ``Recibiamos muchos pedidos de latinoamericanos que entraban en
nuestra pagina electronica y preguntaban por que no teniamos una
pagina adaptada para America Latina,'' dice Chris Hinkle, gerente
de Latin America Online de Dell, quien monto la tienda en linea de
la compania en Japon antes de trabajar en la version
latinoamericana. ``Esto permitira a los clientes entrar y escoger
el producto que quieran con la configuracion exacta que deseen.''
 &HT;    Configurar sus sistemas con la tecnologia mas avanzada sera
novedoso para muchos latinoamericanos, que tienen que viajar a
Estados Unidos para comprar lo que quieren o confiar en las
existencias de los minoristas de sus paises, lo que, en muchos
casos, equivale a comprar equipos viejos y obsoletos. Cuando Intel
lanzo el procesador Pentium II en abril de 1998, los revendedores
latinoamericanos tardaron casi cuatro meses en vender sus
existencias de computadoras mas lentas antes de comenzar a vender
las maquinas nuevas. ``Los distribuidores tratan de vender el
producto que compran,'' dice Sylvia Acevedo, directora de mercadeo
y servicios en linea de Dell para America Latina, que trabajo con
Hinkle en la creacion de la pagina electronica. ``Con nosotros se
puede pedir lo ultimo en tecnologia.''
 &HT;    Despues que los clientes latinoamericanos hacen sus pedidos, las
computadoras se ensamblan en la instalacion de Dell en Texas y se
envian. Cuando llegan a su destino, el cliente la puede recoger en
la aduana y pagar los aranceles o, por una pequena cuota, dejar que
Dell coordine con una firma local el pago de los aranceles y las
cuotas y la entrega del sistema en la puerta del cliente.
 &HT;    Si tiene un problema con su nuevo sistema, el cliente
latinoamericano puede llamar a un numero telefonico gratis y un
tecnico lo ayudara. Si el problema no se puede resolver por
telefono, Dell envia a un tecnico en un plazo maximo de 48 horas.
Todo este servicio es gratis el primer ano. Despues, por una cuota
modica, Dell ofrece una garantia extendida por el segundo y el
tercer ano.
 &HT;    Dell planea agregar a su pagina latinoamericana servicios que en
Estados Unidos ya son habituales: una manera de verificar el estado
de su pedido (si ya se ha ensamblado o si ya se ha enviado) en
tiempo real; un servicio que en ingles se llama ``Ask Dudley''
(Consulte a Dudley), que permite al usuario plantearle una pregunta
a su ``tecnico virtual'' y recibir una respuesta, y poder bajar
aplicaciones que comunican a la computadora con los equipos
perifericos, como la impresora.
 &HT;    El plan de servicio en linea de Dell parece formidable pero hay
un problema: pocos cibernautas. Segun el Yankee Group, firma de
investigacion radicada en Boston, solo hay 2,5 millones de cuentas
de Internet activas en America Latina. La region tiene menos del 3
por ciento de los usuarios de la Web de todo el mundo debido al
bajo numero de PC, las dificultades de infraestructura, los altos
aranceles y el contenido local insuficiente.
 &HT;    No obstante, Yankee Group espera que esa situacion cambie a
medida que los mercados se desregulen, los aranceles bajen, la
infraestructura mejore y el contenido local sea mas abundante.
Cuando eso ocurra, el potencial de la Internet en el continente
podria catapultarse a 90 millones de usuarios, segun un estimado.
 &HT;    Cuando la Internet penetre mas en la region, los
latinoamericanos compraran sus computadoras a traves de la Web?
Acevedo, que es norteamericana hija de mexicanos y veterana de
Apple Computer e IBM, cree que si. ``Hay muchas personas muy
innovadoras y que adoptan rapidamente las novedades tecnologicas,''
dice. ``Vuelan a Miami, a Houston, a McAllen o a Los Angeles, o le
piden a alguien que viene a Estados Unidos que les compre la ultima
tecnologia. Con nuestra tienda en linea, no tendran que hacer
eso.''
 &HT;    Dell comenzo a ofrecer recientemente a las empresas
latinoamericanas paginas individualizadas llamadas Premier Pages,
que les permiten revisar su historial de compra de computadoras y
pedir nuevos sistemas. Dell ha creado esas paginas para 1.500
companias en muchos paises, entre ellas Ford Motor Co.,
PricewaterhouseCoopers y Boeing. Se afirma que esta ultima pidio
1.000 computadoras Dell en una semana a traves del servicio.
 &HT;    Desde el lanzamiento de la version en espanol de Premier Page a
fines del ano pasado, Dell ha hecho contratos con 40 empresas en
America Latina, entre ellas multinacionales como Ford, Motorola y
Northern Telecom. Reforma podria ser la proxima. Cantu dice que
esta trabajando con un representante de Dell en Ciudad de Mexico
para crear la ``Premier Pagina'' del periodico. Dell planea lanzar
una version en portugues este ano.
 &HT;    Funcionara el enfoque directo de Dell en America Latina?
Loverde, de IDC, cree que si. ``Muchas personas han manifestado
dudas sobre diversos aspectos del enfoque directo: el servicio, la
oportunidad, la cultura latina,'' dice. ``Pero pienso que esa
cultura esta cambiando, y que los latinos van a comprar mas en la
Web.''
 &HT;    Los anos de viajes constantes han convencido a Robertson, de
Dell, que el modelo de negocio de su empresa es mas fuerte que la
cultura local. ``Los clientes quieren lo mismo en todas partes: un
producto de gran calidad, precios bajos y buen servicio,'' senala.
``Hemos hecho eso en Europa y en Asia, lo hacemos ahora en China y
tambien lo haremos en America Latina.'' La unica pregunta es si
esta vez el fabricante de computadoras a la medida se quedara para
siempre.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Goodbye, phone-menu torment. Adios, disembodied operators taking
calls in the order received. A revolution in customer service is
emerging on the government pages of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Those daunting Web sites containing volumes of government data,
images and icons are moving beyond the standard fare of search
engines, links, forms that can be downloaded and the like. Now
government officials actually accept questions via e-mail. And,
more important, they send answers.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for information on a rare disease? The U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services (www.hhs.gov) invites inquiries
through its healthfinder.gov, which the site calls ``a free gateway
to reliable consumer health and human services information.''
</P>
<P>
   Wondering whether a neighbor's drainage will affect your
drinking water? The Environmental Protection Agency (www.epa.gov)
has two dozen librarians fielding as many as 1,500 such e-mail
questions each month, with a typical response time of fewer than
five days.
</P>
<P>
   Tax policy questions? The Internal Revenue Service (www.irs.gov)
awaits your e-mail. What about gulf war illnesses or military base
closings? The Department of Veterans Affairs (www.va.gov) and even
the Pentagon, with its chock-full site at www.defenselink.mil, are
churning out e-mail replies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agencies are learning how to use this tool to answer questions
and to provide information,'' said Greg Woods, an Education
Department official who is chairman of the government Information
Technology Services Board, part of Vice President Al Gore's
initiative on reinventing government.
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated 6,000 home pages just for federal agencies,
and countless others for state and local governments, the potential
for e-mail assistance is vast. Of course, most sites have search
engines that can be used to zero in on information. But for some
people, search engines are not the best option _ search terms may
be hard to divine, or the results may be hard to interpret.
</P>
<P>
   So some consumers wanting information are finding that, though
it may take a day or it may take weeks, specialists from the
government are, in some cases, able to give direct answers to
inquiries, point out material already on their sites or refer
questioners to other government resources.
</P>
<P>
   When Lee Bergamini's mother-in-law was moving to Connecticut
from Florida, he needed to notify federal pension officials who
deposit her benefit check in her bank.
</P>
<P>
   Bergamini found the Federal Technology Service's site at
www.usgold.gov, which is in the process of publishing online
directories of all federal agencies and workers. He found the
e-mail address of Jack Finley, director for electronic messaging at
Federal Technology Service.
</P>
<P>
   Finley was able to furnish Bergamini with the Pension Benefit
Guarantee Corp.'s phone number and mailing and online addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Glickman, a Florida political consultant, got stuck when
looking for a comprehensive mailing list of state legislators. She
fired off an e-mail message to the Florida Legislature's site
(www.leg.state.fl.us), which sent her precise instructions on how
to find and download it.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bickner of Madison, Wis., and Linda Powell of Wilmington,
Del., both researching family history, sent e-mail inquiries to the
National Archives and Records Administration (www.nara.gov) and
received replies telling them how to get the records they sought.
The National Archives agency expects that half of its queries from
the public will be by e-mail or fax by 2007, said Jennifer Nelson,
the Webmaster for the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Bickner, a professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison,
said: ``With very little effort, I got the records I have been
looking for. I was so impressed that I sent a message back and
said, `Thank you for putting this very user-friendly feeling on
things.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Powell, a bookkeeper, said: ``The best part is you're not on
hold for half an hour. You send it and it's done.''
</P>
<P>
   But before everyone stampedes the government sites, there is
something of a catch with the e-mail approach: the agencies'
policies are inconsistent and clearly evolving. Some agencies would
rather you called their toll-free numbers, or wrote to them, or
searched the Web site yourself before sending any e-mail queries.
Yes, many post an e-mail address, but some make it a challenge to
find it on their sites.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the ``contact information'' button on the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration home page
(www.osha.gov) leads to a directive to use the phone, not e-mail,
to reach the agency in emergencies and to call regional offices for
policy or regulatory questions. Some hunting turns up a
``suggestion box'' page that solicits comments or ideas but bars
inquiries about policy or regulatory issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ideal Web site is to answer as many questions as possible,
so the last option is to send an e-mail which requires a person to
intervene and answer a question,'' said Rich Kellet, division
director for Emerging Information Technology Policies at the
General Services Administration. ``E-mail is a difficult issue
because of the volume and the potential for huge volume. So
agencies are still working on how to answer those issues.''
</P>
<P>
   In another development related to government information online,
the government's National Technical Information Service and
Northern Light Technology announced a fee-based search engine for
federal government Internet sites and documents on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But the project was delayed for review a day after it was
announced, signaling that the Commerce Department may be having
second thoughts about whether the cross-agency search service
conflicts with the Clinton administration's policy on unrestricted
access to government information.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many government agencies are independently struggling
with ways to provide information and assistance for free, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Lai, director of General Services' Center for Emerging
Technologies, which oversees the agency's site at info.gov, said
his staff generally directed people to the agency's information
specialists who answer a toll-free number at the Federal
Information Center. ``We don't encourage people to send e-mail,''
Lai said.
</P>
<P>
   Many agencies, including the Social Security Administration
(www.ssa.gov), use a ``feedback'' link. But Social Security's site
specifies that feedback means comments about the Web site, not
requests for information. The agency fields 70 million telephone
calls a year on its 24-hour toll-free lines. Even so, the agency
manages to respond to 55,000 e-mail messages a year, officials say,
and its New York regional home page, for one, does invite e-mail
questions.

 UNDATED: e-mail questions.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over at the notoriously sluggish Immigration and Naturalization
Service, there is a reason why the site www.ins.usdoj.gov contains
no e-mail addresses. Greg Gagne, a spokesman for the agency, said
incoming messages ``would be astonishing because of the huge
demand'' on a site visited by 430,000 users a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``What may seem quite simple is quite often not so simple, and
it takes an extraordinary amount of work to answer,'' Gagne said.
Even so, the agency plans to revamp its Web site and include e-mail
capability by the end of the year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The welcome mat is already out at the Internal Revenue Service,
where chatty language and animated cartoon figures throughout the
site are chipping away at the agency's stodgy image.
</P>
<P>
   At www.irs.gov, the agency promises: ``We'll help you cut
through the clutter. Now just tell us what else you need.'' Its
e-mail flow has grown to a projected 300,000 questions this year
from 13,000 in 1996, said Dave Medeck, national director of the
telephone operations division. Two hundred revenue agents and audit
staff members answer the e-mail, handling general policy questions
but not individual tax cases, Medeck said.
</P>
<P>
   The mere fact of a personal reply is satisfaction for some who
send e-mail queries, and actually getting solutions can be
empowering.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Scott-Aughtry contacted a Social Security branch in
Baltimore by e-mail and was able to resolve a months-old delay in
payment of her benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I quit school when I was in 10th grade,'' Ms. Scott-Aughtry
said. ``I've been working ever since. For me to go into the
computer and accomplish that, it really made me feel great.''
</P>
<P>
   The Online Data Trail
</P>
<P>
   It was like having a personal government staff. I needed some
research on past presidential Cabinets. I could have plowed through
library books, but I knew the National Archives and Records
Administration would have my answer in its millions of pages of
documents.
</P>
<P>
   I logged on to www.nara.gov. My information wasn't there, but an
e-mail address was. I sent off my query, and 12 days later I
received the precise information, complete with citations and
details, in an e-mail message that was as chipper as a happy-face
sticker. This was the most gratifying use of my tax dollars since
the Park Service began building bike paths.
</P>
<P>
   So when tax season came along, I visited the Internal Revenue
Service online (www.irs.gov). My e-mail query requested the
agency's standard for reimbursable mileage costs, and back came the
reply: 31 cents per mile. It was a softball, but I was still
impressed that I got a reply in less than two days.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most impressive was my online encounter with the
California Environmental Protection Agency (www.calepa.ca.gov). I
wanted to know whether the air quality was improving in parts of my
home state. The agency replied to my query in three days, stating
that my message had been forwarded to the Air Resources Board. The
same day, the ombudsman's office of the Air Resources Board came
through with several Web addresses for air quality information.
</P>
<P>
   The specialist who wrote to me, Jon Pederson, also offered to
mail an article on ``clean air pockets'' from The Los Angeles
Times. The article arrived a few days later. Another delightful
experience.
</P>
<P>
   But at some point, even e-mail information seekers must do a
little work. Asking the Census Bureau (www.census.gov) for specific
economic information a while back brought an e-mail response a
month later listing several Census reports that I could order for
$10 to $150 apiece. Then I'd have to search the pages myself for my
data. I passed on the offer.

MEXICAN GOVERNOR DENOUNCES CORRUPTION, URGES ECONOMIC OPENNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A leading Mexican opposition candidate for
president said Wednesday that his country will never crack down on
drug lords or fix its economy as long as the ruling party remains
in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become experts in surviving crisis, but not in
stabilizing the economy for our companies,'' Vicente Fox Quesada,
governor of the central state of Guanajuato, told a gathering of
professors and congressional staff members in the Capitol Building.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Mexican government must balance its budget to
convince both domestic and international investors that the country
is stable. Fox, a manufacturer of cowboy boots and former Coca-Cola
Mexico executive, also embraced privatization of state-owned
industries and the opening of his country's economy to
international competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Globalization is not a threat to those who do their homework
and can compete,'' said Fox, whose state exports to more than 100
countries and has investors from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who has been campaigning nationwide for a year for the
presidential nomination of the conservative National Action Party,
or PAN, also defended the North American Free Trade Agreement,
saying it was ``key'' to Mexico's economic future.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent Harris Poll, nearly three out of four Mexicans
surveyed said the 1994 trade pact, which seeks to eliminate trade
barriers between Canada, Mexico and the United States, has been
good for the United States while only 43 percent said it was also
helping Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's nationwide campaign has helped forge an early advantage in
opinion polls. He leads Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, the mayor of
Mexico City, who is the likely candidate of the left-leaning Party
of the Democratic Revolution, or PRD.
</P>
<P>
   Fox also leads all potential candidates from the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, including Interior
Minister Francisco Labastida Ochoa, who is believed to be President
Ernesto Zedillo's preferred choice.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI has dominated Mexico's government for more than 70
years, but opposition parties have been steadily chipping away at
its power. The congressional elections in 1997 were a watershed,
with four opposition parties capturing 261 seats in the 500-member
lower house of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI, in a shift away from political patronage and toward the
democratization that Zedillo has promised, this week announced that
it would hold a primary for the first time later this year to
select a successor to Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the PRI move to a primary, Fox said the Mexican people
will be looking for change in the 2000 presidential elections after
so many years under PRI leadership. ``Not even communism lasted as
long as the PRI,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   On the issues of drugs and crime, the governor said corruption
has become so endemic among state and federal officials that only a
new government could hope to root it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI has not done anything to stop corruption in 70 years
and they will not do anything in another 70 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said the most effective way to end corruption was for the
country to have ``full democracy'' in which all public officials
were held accountable to the people through elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the people know a mayor or governor or any other official
has taken money, they will kick him out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Each year the United States wrestles with certifying Mexico as a
partner in the war on drugs. And as a perennial part of that
process, critics cite rampant corruption in the government as a
reason not to extend the certification, without which Mexico could
lose some U.S. aid.

   Fox said improving the economy and reducing crime eventually
will be determined in large part by how well Mexico educates its
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need an education revolution in this country, for without
it little can be achieved,'' said Fox, who holds a bachelor's
degree in business administration from Universidad Iberoamericana
in Mexico City and a management diploma from Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Mexican government should guarantee every citizen
the right to attend high school and college. Currently, the average
Mexican has fewer than seven years of formal education, compared to
14 years for industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must ensure that every Mexican has the opportunity to move
forward,'' Fox said.

BRITAIN NAMES A LAUREATE OF POEMS, NOT SURPRISES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Andrew Motion, a 47-year-old London poet, critic,
biographer and professor of creative writing, was chosen Wednesday
to become Britain's poet laureate, succeeding Ted Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Motion was seen as the most conventional of the many mooted
candidates, and his selection put to rest rumors alarming to
traditionalists that Tony Blair, the modernity-minded prime
minister, might bypass known writers in favor of a ``people's
poet.'' Sir Paul McCartney was one name mentioned in that context.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes held the post for 14 years until his death in October.
The job has in the past been a lifetime appointment underwritten by
a case of sherry and 100 pounds ($162) a year, but in a departure
from custom, Wednesday's statement from 10 Downing St. said that
Motion's appointment would be for 10 years and that there would be
an annual payment of 5,000 pounds ($8,100).
</P>
<P>
   The poet laureate is approved by the queen but chosen from a
short list by the prime minister. Past honorees include Tennyson,
Wordsworth, Cecil Day-Lewis, John Masefield and John Betjeman. The
first poet laureate was John Dryden in 1670, and although there is
no formal job description, it is understood to necessitate writing
verse about the royal family and on grand national and ceremonial
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Where many poets mentioned as candidates for the post balked at
this requirement, Motion had demonstrated his willingness by
writing, unbidden, a poem about the death of Diana, Princess of
Wales. The poem, ``Mythology,'' read in part:
</P>
<P>
   ``Your life was not your
</P>
<P>
   own to keep
</P>
<P>
   or lose. Beside the river,
</P>
<P>
   swerving under ground,
</P>
<P>
   your future tracked you,
</P>
<P>
   snapping at your heels;
</P>
<P>
   Diana, breathless, hunted
</P>
<P>
   by your own quick
</P>
<P>
   hounds.''
</P>
<P>
   He also marked the passing of Hughes, whom he greatly admired,
with verse.
</P>
<P>
   Glasgow poet Carol Ann Duffy said recently that if chosen she
would refuse to celebrate in verse the next royal event, the
marriage this summer of Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones. ``No
self-respecting poet should have to,'' she told The Guardian.
``There are so many more interesting things to do with the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Numbers of other poets let it be known that they did not want to
be considered for the post at all. When a reporter at The New York
Times called Craig Raine, an Oxford poet, last December to ask if
he was interested, he exclaimed, ``Oh God, no!'' and hung up the
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes became laureate only after Philip Larkin rejected it.
Though widely admired as a great poet, he was faulted to the point
of ridicule for much of the verse he composed in the position.
</P>
<P>
   Motion, who had made it widely known that he would like the job,
said Wednesday that he saw the post as ``an extremely complex and
interesting challenge for a poet.'' Speaking from Sydney,
Australia, where he was attending a literary festival, he said, ``I
think that I want to honor the traditional responsibilities, to
write poems about royal occasions and so on, but I am also very
keen to diversify the job, or at least make those poems part of the
wider national issues that I also want to write about.'' He said he
particularly wanted to promote poetry in schools.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a comment that he had been viewed as the ``safe''
choice for the job, Motion said, ``Everything I have done in my
life I have intended to reform, so I didn't really recognize that
description of me.'' He vowed that he would not write poems that
are ``merely sycophantic or sentimental.''
</P>
<P>
   Motion lives in Islington, the North London neighborhood where
Blair lived before moving to 10 Downing St. He studied at Oxford
and holds the creative writing professorship at the University of
East Anglia in Norwich. He has published nine volumes of verse,
written a well-regarded biography of Keats and won the Whitbread
Prize for his life of Larkin, the poet who declined the laureate
position.
</P>
<P>
   Though the post itself is not held in universally high esteem,
the race to see who will get it stirs broad interest, and official
odds are quoted at William Hill, Britain's biggest betting agency.
Besides Ms. Duffy, candidates making it onto the agency's lists
included Seamus Heaney, Derek Walcott, Wendy Cope, Benjamin
Zephaniah, James Fenton, Tom Paulin and Geoffrey Hill.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial Wednesday welcoming the expected choice of
Motion, The Times of London called him ``a poet of quiet
understanding, gentle humanity and lyric force. His is a very
British body of work, bound by sea and salt flats, personal loss
and the national past.''

 &HT;    'STAR-SPANGLED BANNER' BENEFITS FROM PRESERVATION GRANT
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Not the rockets' red glare, but a 90-year onslaught
of indoor light, air pollution and temperature change has the
original Star-Spangled Banner on its way to the Smithsonian
Institution's version of an intensive care unit.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning early next year, a team of museum conservationists
will undertake a meticulous inch-by-inch cleaning of the
30-by-34-foot woolen flag that inspired Francis Scott Key's famous
1814 poem.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration effort, which officials of the Smithsonian's
National Museum of American History say will take will more than a
year, was one of 62 projects named Wednesday to receive federal
historic preservation grants under the new ``Save America's
Treasures'' program.
</P>
<P>
   The grants were announced by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Other projects include preservation of the 1905 Wright Flyer in
Dayton, Ohio, restoration of historic Ebenezer Baptist Church in
Atlanta and stabilization of Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas
National Park in Monroe County, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Smithsonian officials say cleaning the flag and re-exhibiting it
will cost $18 million before the job is finished.
</P>
<P>
   They say they are not trying to make the flag that flew over
Baltimore's Fort McHenry during the War of 1812 ``look like new.''
</P>
<P>
   But they hope that by scrutinizing nearly every thread in the
flag and cleaning it with dry cleaning solution and special vacuum
cleaners, they can stabilize it and arrest the deterioration that
has done a lot more damage than British troops did with their
rockets and bombs bursting in air.
</P>
<P>
   The work is being done in a special laboratory and has been
turned into another Smithsonian exhibit: the public can watch
conservators while they blot, vacuum and scrub.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to some stains, the wool has been weakened by
exposure to light and oxygen in the air, said Suzanne
Thomassen-Kraus, a museum conservator.
</P>
<P>
   Besides cleaning it up, museum officials have decided to remove
a linen backing that a team of Boston seamstresses hand-sewed to
the flag in 1914, seven years after the banner was donated to the
Smithsonian and 17 years before the song was officially named the
national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   A new backing material has not yet been selected.

A WELL UNTAPPED: BLACK FOLK TALES OF THE OLD SOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SARA KENNEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years after a rich collection of African-American folk
stories gathered in the 1920s and '30s by the writer Zora Neale
Hurston was discovered in the photo files of the Smithsonian
Institution, it remains unpublished.
</P>
<P>
   The work was discovered by Kristy Anderson, 47, an independent
filmmaker from Tampa, Fla., who was examining photos at the
National Gallery of Art and came upon a computer listing of Hurston
materials titled ``Negro folk tales from the Gulf States,
1927-31.''
</P>
<P>
   When she got the works from the National Anthropological
Archives, part of the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural
History, she realized the manuscript, with 482 folk tales told to
Hurston, a black writer, by 121 people, was an important literary
find.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know every Hurston manuscript published and unpublished, and
I knew it was new,'' she recalled in a recent interview at her
Tampa home. The tales are important because they are the sort of
unvarnished material Hurston would have liked to print as it was,
but her New York publishers, apparently concerned about its
explosive racial frankness, would only permit its tamer portions to
be included in her works.
</P>
<P>
   There still are problems in having the material published,
including the scarcity of Hurston scholars and meager pressure from
academia for its publication. Moreover, there are eight Hurston
heirs, who must decide together what should be published. The
Hurston estate's literary agent, Victoria Sanders, said: ``I
haven't told anybody yet. It's all new.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurston's books have recently had a renaissance and are finding
a new generation of readers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anderson's discovery is significant because of its large
size, nearly 300 pages. Scholars say the tales provide a glimpse
into the complex, emotive language and oral storytelling traditions
of poor, rural black people in the South when the segregated
society considered their culture unimportant and rarely recorded
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a tremendous find,'' Ms. Sanders said, adding
that it was valuable commercially as well as for other reasons and
that ``certainly the estate is happy she has brought it to our
attention.`
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Hemmenway, a Hurston biographer, said the document
was important because ``there are things in the manuscript that
have not been published before and represent a wonderful
compilation of African-American folk tales.'' He said the document
also appeared to have been the raw material for ``Mules and Men,''
Hurston's seminal collection of African-American folklore,
published in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a significant find for two reasons,'' said
Hemmenway, who is also chancellor of the University of Kansas, in a
telephone interview. He said the collection ``tells us something
about the decisions Zora made when she put together `Mules and
Men,' and it's an important collection of black folk tales at a
time when African-American life was becoming increasingly urbanized
and a lot of Southern blacks were moving into the urban North,''
and some of their stories got lost along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it becomes is the expressive and imaginative culture of
people who many times were illiterate,'' Hemmenway said. ``They
were not sitting down writing short stories and poems. They were
telling tales. It's a cultural window into how people lived. You
can learn more about what life was like for African-Americans by
their folklore.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurston collected the stories during trips through the rural
South paid for by a wealthy white patron, Charlotte Mason of New
York. A contract with Hurston dated Dec. 1, 1927, specified that
the information compiled must not be divulged to anyone else,
perhaps another reason much of the collection remains unpublished.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mason provided Hurston with an automobile, a motion picture
camera and $200 a month to roam the South in search of the best
tall tales and most interesting stories. Hurston took one dress,
packed a pearl-handled pistol in her purse and, posing as a
bootlegger's girlfriend from Jacksonville, haunted sawmill camps,
juke joints and workplaces across Florida, Alabama, Louisiana and
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would say, `I just need a little time here cause my man's
in the joint,' and the next thing you know, she's collecting folk
tales and songs and everything else,'' Hemmenway said.
</P>
<P>
   Her tales were couched in the black dialect of the South and
carried an angry undercurrent of protest against the harsh,
strictly segregated and frequently dangerous society in which the
storytellers lived. God talks, preacher tales, devil tales, witch
and hant (ghost) tales; John and Massa tales (servant and master);
Massa and white folks tales (about white people), and tales about
talking animals and cheating lovers were all included, Dr.
Hemmenway said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black people in slavery are explaining to each other why
something is the way it is in the John and Massa tales; it gives
black people a way to explain why white people are oppressing black
people,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the pages of the document are in Hurston's own hand. She
listed the real names, ages, occupations and hometowns of her
sources, which included schoolchildren, domestic workers, phosphate
miners, lumber, sawmill and railroad workers, housewives, preachers
and even one person identified as a ``bum and roustabout.'' Some
were identified as former slaves, like a Sally Smith who Hurston
indicated had been born in Tarkwa, in what is now Ghana, and
brought to the United States in 1859.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are still trying to determine why the manuscript
containing the folk tales remained unnoticed for decades in the
photo files at the Smithsonian, said Hamlet Paoletti, a public
affairs specialist there.
</P>
<P>
   It is the latest in a string of Hurston works to pop up in
arcane places. When Hurston died penniless and little known in
1960, her papers were not saved as part of her estate but were
dispersed. They are now being gradually rediscovered.
</P>
<P>
   The National Endowment for the Arts is providing $75,000 to the
film production company of Ms. Anderson and to Julie Dash, a Los
Angeles filmmaker, to finish their biographical documentary about
Hurston, which is tentatively titled ``Black South'' and is
scheduled for completion within a year, Ms. Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Hurston studied anthropology seriously and wrote 4 novels, 36
short stories, 2 books of folklore (the newly found document might
be considered the third), an autobiography, pieces for the Florida
Writer's Project and a dozen plays, Ms. Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   Lois Gaston of Tampa, Hurston's grandniece and at one point the
spokeswoman for most of the writer's heirs, said she had not seen
the document and could not say whether it would be published. ``At
this point, about all I can really say is I'm aware, and we're just
delighted anytime something supports Zora and her contribution to
our society in terms of preserving our culture,'' she said, adding,
``We're excited because it is something that promotes Zora and her
dedication and commitment to her craft and her calling.''

`HEARTBREAKER:' FINGERNAILS, CAKE BOXES; THE FEAR IS EVERYWHERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
(DW) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To get quickly into the mood of ``Heartbreaker,'' Robert
Ferrigno's fifth and latest noir crime thriller (after ``The Horse
Latitudes,'' ``The Cheshire Moon,'' ``Dead Man's Dance'' and ``Dead
Silent''), consider the character Armando.
</P>
<P>
   Armando is ``a slender sociopath from the Medellin slums with a
mouth like a kewpie doll, his hair a nest of braids tied with gold,
blue, and red ribbons, the colors of the Colombian flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Armando is ``what the South Americans called a dead boy, an
utterly loyal assassin, devoid of compassion or desire.'' His
favorite weapons are the tips of his right-hand middle and index
fingers, to the nails of which he has epoxied ``surgical-steel
chips sharp enough to shave with,'' and lacquered pink to match his
real nails. When he flutters his hands in the air his nails look
like ``flamingos taking off.'' When he flutters them close to his
victims they often bleed without at first understanding why.
</P>
<P>
   Armando, a bodyguard, is among the many unpleasant characters
who infest the plot of ``Heartbreaker.'' His boss, Junior Mayfield,
is one of the remaining ``good ol' boys'' in the Florida drug trade
not ``killed off or scared off when the South Americans moved in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cali cartel tortured informers with chain saws; Junior
threw a barbecue, sent the blackened head to the magpie's family in
a Baskin-Robbins cake box. The Cubans introduced Mac-10 drivebys;
Junior responded with a truck bomb that leveled Diego Ortiz's
mansion on Key Biscayne, killing Ortiz, his wife and children, five
servants, and eight bodyguards.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Junior wants to sic Armando on Valentine (Val) Duran, an
undercover cop who has been messing up Junior's business. To
protect his grandmother, Val has moved with her to Los Angeles,
where with nothing but the best intentions he has gotten himself
involved in yet another dangerous situation.
</P>
<P>
   Having fallen for Kyle Abbott, a beautiful marine biologist who
lives down the hall from him in his new apartment, Val gets invited
to the home of her rich mother and stepfather, Gwendolyn and
Charles Abbott II. There he meets Kyle's handsome playboy
stepbrother, Charles Abbott 3d, nicknamed Kilo for the kilogram of
marijuana the police once caught him with in his car.
</P>
<P>
   Kilo's date is Jackie Hendricks, a stunning redhead whom, it
turns out, he has hired to kill his stepmother (Kyle's mother) for
control of the family money she doesn't trust in his squandering
hands. When Val discovers this plot, he finds himself hunted not
only by Junior and the pernicious Armando but also by Kilo's and
Jackie's muscle, Darryl Dekker, an oversize psychopath with a mind
that seems to have been unhinged by ``a whiff of Saddam's nerve
gas.'' What is distinctive about Ferrigno's gripping action is that
as usual it is often set in a natural world whose appeal he makes
the reader vividly feel. When Val and Kyle first meet they walk
under a night sky that prompts Val to remark, ``My grandmother
would see a sky like this, and she'd say that it looked like God
had dropped stars across the night and not bothered to pick up
after himself.''
</P>
<P>
   At the denouement of their affair, they take a ride in the
motorboat Kyle uses for her research. ``Forty yards away the sea
burst into a huge plume that became a gray whale, then another and
another, the sea erupting with whales, drenching Val and Kyle with
spray. Val counted at least 11 or 12 of them breaching, adults and
calves cavorting in the twilight. Their boat rocked wildly, water
slopping over the sides, while he hung on, too overwhelmed to be
frightened. The whales were gone as quickly as they had arrived,
the waves returning to their choppy regularity. The night was empty
without them.''
</P>
<P>
   Is this a world, then, where every prospect pleases, and only
man is vile? Hardly. Among Val's quirky friends is Oscar, a lawyer
whose hobby is building a miniature golf course modeled on horror
movies. Kyle is not impressed. ``Horror movies are fake,'' she
says. ``I'm used to the real thing.''
</P>
<P>
   When she contemplates the fifth hole of Oscar's course, based on
``Invasion of the Body Snatchers,'' she describes a water beetle,
Dytiscus, whose larval form is equipped with hollow sickle-shaped
mandibles ``sharp as razors.'' With them Dytiscus impales creatures
that float by, ``maybe a mosquito wriggler,'' injects digestive
acid into them and pumps their dissolved insides out.
</P>
<P>
   `` `When Dytiscus is done, the wriggler is just an empty bag of
skin drifting off in the water.' Kyle grinned at Val in triumph.
`That's a horror show.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As Val remarks in another context, ``Mother Nature loves a
winner.'' When Ferrigno is done, most of his characters are empty
bags of skin, drifting off in the ether. Yet the reader is
altogether entertained.

 By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It had been a volatile week on Wall Street. On the
Big Board, trading was heavy; the Dow marched steadily toward 9000.
But last July, Carey Maloney and Hermes Mallea were busy
orchestrating their own big deals.
</P>
<P>
   The designers of M (Group) were reeling their Rolodexes and
flexing their shopping-arm muscles on behalf of Barry Gesser, a
single, 35-year-old hedge-fund manager, who had purchased a house
in Bedford, N.Y., and right before Memorial Day asked the designers
to ``pull his place together'' by the Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted it done _ spare no expense _ in six weeks: 10
bedrooms, a pool house, stables, tennis courts and two three-car
garages _ overhauled, outfitted and furnished, right down to a
selection of clothes hangers.
</P>
<P>
   So, Maloney and Mallea were suited up for action, directing 25
painters as they hand-glazed the dining room pale robin's-egg blue
and white-washed the fences, flying in a suite of teak garden
furniture from California, selecting a hand-knotted rug from Doris
Leslie Blau for the living room, having the mint julep cups
monogrammed and overseeing 24 window washers.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the third week, I was wondering, What have we gotten
into?'' Maloney said. ``I would never do it again. We were just
beat.''
</P>
<P>
   When the opening bell dings on Wall Street these days, it's not
just the traders, brokers and the hedge-fund managers who are off
and running. Their architects and designers are on the move, too:
going to auctions, flying in French antiques, commissioning fine
woodworkers, paneling libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Million-dollar decorating marathons have become a fact of life
for many designers catering to the under-40 Wall Street set. This
new generation of getters and spenders is no longer satisfied with
Porsches and $1,000 bottles of Petrus, the traditional perks of the
bull-market trade.
</P>
<P>
   Like Mr. Darcy, Jane Austen's bachelor extraordinaire, these men
and women demand well-appointed manses custom-furnished, fully
curated (with the latest electronics, not art) and loaded with
personality. The designer's will do in a pinch. When Maloney and
Mallea asked Gesser's secretary for personal snapshots as a homey
touch, and none arrived in time, they filled his frames with
pictures of their chihuahua, Pancho.
</P>
<P>
   For trading-floor millionaires, speed is of the essence,
transforming decorating _ historically, a painstaking process of
soul-searching followed by shopping, finding, returning, picking
and waiting, then waiting some more for delivery of the goods _
into a homesteading steeplechase.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys took the ball and ran,'' Gesser said. ``I had
nothing to do with it. It was great.'' He had wanted a look that
would ``wow'' visitors but still be relaxed enough ``to have your
25-year-old girlfriend over to bounce a little bit on the
couches.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We Wall Streeters want the best,'' he added. ``We want to buy
the right stuff, but we don't necessarily know what it is. So, we
turn to pros like Carey and Hermes. I saw that they'd done the
Bronfmans' place,'' he said, referring to Clarissa and Edgar
Bronfman Jr., ``and I figured if anyone knows what the right stuff
is, they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald O. Perelman's five-week renovation of the Creeks in East
Hampton, N.Y., has also become the stuff of legend for Wall
Streeters feeling the homing instinct. A local real estate agent,
Tina Fredericks, confirmed that the financier saw the
12,000-square-foot black stucco mansion on a Saturday, closed the
$12 million deal on Sunday and by Monday had more than 30
contractors working to get ready for the Fourth of July in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured that's what I wanted for July 4th, too,'' Gesser
said. ``I told them: `I don't care what it takes. Just do it.'''
His six-week project, he said, cost in the low millions.
</P>
<P>
   For the connoisseur consumer, spending clout used to mean being
able to buy the highest quality at any cost. Today, risk-taking
clients go for a different premium: they want high quality twice as
fast, leaving the design profession to do the sweating.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they want people to know they paid overtime to get it,''
Maloney said.
</P>
<P>
   While some design professionals say these clients' rapid-fire
decision-making and obsession with ``status details'' _ such as
getting Barbra Streisand's acoustician on the job _ are admirably
direct, others say they are overwhelmed just talking to the fresh
princes of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have done a seven-bedroom house from ground up, with
everything in it, between Labor Day and Memorial weekend,'' said
Carl D'Aquino, a Manhattan designer. ``I've done it twice, but I
don't like it. You have to be in war mode. You have to be in
condition. And your general contractor has to be big enough to
throw 30 people at the project.''
</P>
<P>
   For D'Aquino, a paneled library is often the most daunting
challenge. ``They all have to have a paneled library, but they
don't have any books,'' he said of a handful of Wall Street
clients. ``They don't even read magazines!'' He recalled moving one
bookless 30-year-old bachelor into a three-bedroom apartment with a
library. ``One day, he told me: `I bought a book today!' It stopped
me in my tracks. `Good! Which one?' I said. Well, he didn't know
the name of the book. He only knew that it was leather-bound with
gold lettering. It turned out to be Moby Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   An aura of impersonality often typifies the stir-to-dissolve
decor of young Wall Streeters, as might be expected when your
designer orders everything, down to the mood candles. ``They're
only interested in surface,'' lamented one designer, who requested
anonymity because he works with several trader clients. ``The '80s
Wall Streeters at least made an attempt to understand design. Now,
all they want is styled image.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is an impressive decisiveness. ``There's no playing
around,'' D'Aquino noted. ``If they like it, they like it right
away.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lyle Wilpon, 32, an investment banker, who admitted that he is
``compulsive about details,'' made that work for him. His designer,
Gary Mickelson, recreated the calming, beige-on-beige palette of
the Frick Museum in a new Park Avenue apartment _ ``to soothe
someone dealing with different time zones.''
</P>
<P>
   In a technique employed by many decorators working with
time-conscious clients, Mickelson relied on one furniture maker,
Todd Hase, to make practically all the furnishings. But the detail
that his client enthused most about was the Gracious Home tie rack
the designer installed in the closet. ``I got about 15 million
calls about the tie rack,'' Mickelson recalled. ``He counted the
prongs.''
</P>
<P>
   Obsession with detail doesn't mean a client is interested in
getting involved in the decorating process. Because Gesser didn't
want to shop, his designers took Polaroids of fabrics and antiques
and asked him to eliminate ones he couldn't live with. ``He never
knew for sure what he was actually getting,'' Maloney said, noting
that it took Gesser about a minute to select 40 pieces of
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   The dining-room chairs were hand-built by Sotheby's Restoration,
a service offered by the auction house, which was able to copy
antiques in time. To avoid the prolonged vigil of waiting for
custom-ordered fabrics, the designers selected only materials in
stock. ``We didn't show him anything he couldn't have,'' Maloney
said.
</P>
<P>
   On July 3, the day Gesser moved in, there were 50 people
swarming over the place. The driveway had been regraveled 40
minutes earlier; the fences were still being painted as he passed
through the gate in his black Lincoln Navigator. A breakfast table
by the pool was laid out. The library shelves were stocked from a
local bookstore, Maloney said: ``Hermes did A to L; an associate
did M to Z, and I did biographies, garden and history. The books
humanized the place instantly.'' The designers even signed Gesser
up for membership in the Bedford Historical Society.
</P>
<P>
   It helped that Gesser gave them enough money in advance to cover
the bills. ``We owed him money through the entire process,''
Maloney said.
</P>
<P>
   In a practice that seems to be increasingly common when dealing
with here-today (perhaps gone tomorrow) financing, Benjamin
Noriega-Ortiz, a Manhattan designer, asks for full payment up
front.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just too hard to get them to focus on writing checks,''
Noriega-Ortiz said. For one client, a single hedge-fund manager,
35, who did not want to be named, the decision to buy and decorate
an apartment did not come easily. ``I was having so much fun in
stocks that I didn't really want to take the money out,'' she said.
But once she decided to buy an Upper West Side duplex, she moved in
last May, contacted a designer and was settled in by that July.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in the middle of the day, she was sun-bathing in her
bikini on the balcony. A gold-embroidered Indian silk sari was
flung casually on a Brunschwig &AMP; Fils armchair _ one of the many
personal touches the designer provided a year ago that remained in
place.
</P>
<P>
   A sofa was upholstered in orange velvet with quilted gold silk
cushions. A regulation kitchen was hidden by a voluminous
Teflon-coated curtain. ``I did the whole place in the time it took
to order the fabrics from one source,'' Noriega-Ortiz said.
``That's three months. It had to look elegant and it had to be
instant.'' The artworks came mostly from one gallery in SoHo. ``It
took about 10 minutes,'' Noriega-Ortiz said. One piece, made from
sculptured wax, was being used to stow her Labrador's chew toys. A
price tag still dangled from an Italian-made leather desk chair.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the woman bought a 1763 country house in Connecticut,
and she says she plans to take things a bit more slowly. The thrill
of decorating has paled. ``For a while, I was into houses, then I
was into kitchen accessories,'' she said, describing the cooking
classes she took at home from a chef. ``Now, I'm into doing my own
hedge fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Gesser, too, has moved on. He has just put his house in Bedford
up for sale and is looking for a new place in the Hamptons. Maloney
and Mallea just couldn't say no to renovating his new multimillion
dollar town house on the Upper East Side. When the designers met up
with him in Bedford recently, they noticed that their photographs
of Pancho still filled his picture frames. A trusty friend to the
last.

HISTORY'S SHADOW FOILS NANKING CHRONICLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than a half-century after the Japanese invasion of the
ancient Chinese city of Nanking, a tense international literary tug
of words has flared over the Japanese translation of a bestselling
book in the United States, ``The Rape of Nanking,'' which was
scheduled to be published in Japan this year.
</P>
<P>
   The American publisher, Basic Books, and the Japanese company,
Kashiwashobo, ended months of wrangling this week by canceling
their contract for a translation of Iris Chang's chronicle of the
Japanese army's military atrocities in the Rape of Nanking, which
involved the systematic killing of 300,000 Chinese civilians and
prisoners in a city of fewer than 650,000 people in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   From Tokyo, Kashiwashobo's editor in chief, Hiraku Haga,
declared that he did not trust the book. ``It's biased, prejudiced
and like wartime propaganda,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the American publisher, John Donatich, issued a
statement expressing regret. ``The contract between us stipulated
very clearly that no modifications to the text or artwork of
Basic's edition be made without the author's consent,'' he said,
noting that the Japanese publisher and the author could not agree
on changes.
</P>
<P>
   Kashiwashobo had sought to add notes and eliminate photographs
in the book over the objections of Ms. Chang. She said she
suspected that those actions were motivated by threats from
right-wing Japanese organizations that challenge her description of
events. ``I think it is safe to assume that they were cracking
under pressure from ultranationalist groups,'' said Ms. Chang, who
lives in Sunnyvale, Calif., and whose immigrant Chinese parents
passed down stories to her as a child of the atrocities in Nanking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denial,'' she added, ``is an integral part of atrocity, and
it's a natural part after a society has committed genocide. First
you kill, and then the memory of killing is killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan has historically been reluctant to take responsibility for
wartime atrocities, and some prominent Japanese officials contend
that the incident in Nanking never happened. In recent years there
has been increasing pressure from left-wing historians and others
to explore that past. But mainstream politicians and education
officials still tend to play down that history, charging that the
West has exaggerated accounts.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first time that publishers have dueled over
sensitive books that crossed borders. In 1997 Doubleday
successfully sued to halt the publication of a Polish translation
of an American biography of Pope John Paul II that had been heavily
edited by the Polish publisher to tone down some of the words of
the authors, Carl Bernstein and Marco Politi, and to remove
references to the pope's ill health, to Polish anti-Semitism and to
criticism of the Roman Catholic Church in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   With the increasing export of American books to other countries,
it is likely that there will more literary debates about books that
challenge sensitive views about local events. But so far such
arguments are relatively uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unusual,'' said Carolyn Savarese, vice president and
group rights director for the Perseus Books Group, which includes
Basic Books. ``In the 50 years that Basic has been publishing books
around the world, that has never happened before, and I think that
says a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Basic and Kashiwashobo initially struck an agreement to publish
``The Rape of Nanking'' in May 1998 despite interest from other
Japanese publishers, Ms. Savarese said. As part of that contract,
she said, Basic included the stipulation that ``no modifications to
the text of the original edition could be made without the author's
consent.''
</P>
<P>
   The hardcover version of the book, a stinging indictment of the
behavior of Japanese military in Nanking, was first published in
the fall of 1997 in the United States to general critical acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on diaries of soldiers, contemporary interviews and news
accounts from the time, Ms. Chang describes mass executions of
prisoners of war, the rape and killing of women, the burning of
homes and the hunt for young men who might challenge the military
in the future. And she tries to explain what motivated the
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Takokoro Kozo, who was a soldier in the 114th Division of the
Japanese army, is quoted in the book as saying, ``Women suffered
most,'' and adding, ``Perhaps when we were raping her we looked at
her as a woman, but when we killed her we just thought of her as
something like a pig.''
</P>
<P>
   After the publishers signed the contract for a Japanese version
of the book, the efforts to translate it faced problems almost
immediately. Ms. Chang received a letter from a Japanese literary
agency alerting her that several Japanese historians had declined
to review the translation, and that one professor had backed out
because of pressure placed on his family by ``an unknown
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Kashiwashobo started sending her letters seeking
corrections and annotations to material in the book after creating
a group to review her work. Haga of Kashiwashobo said in an
interview Wednesday that the issue amounted to a contract dispute,
and that his company was not responding to pressure from groups
that disliked the book. His company did request changes, he said,
but did not insist on them.
</P>
<P>
   Kashiwashobo, he said, did receive a faxed threat demanding a
halt to the publication of the book and was visited by members of
an organization that ``did not make a verbal threat, but basically
wanted to voice the concern that the book may influence the younger
generation.'' But he noted that his company was pressing forward
with plans to publish other titles that examine Japanese war
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But in e-mail correspondence quoted by Ms. Chang, Haga wrote,
``As we have indicated before, our publishing company is subject to
considerable attack and it's not an exaggeration to say that we
have put ourselves in a life-threatening situation in publishing
this book.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the author and the Japanese publisher would trade
letters debating suggested corrections and a proposal to eliminate
certain photographs, like one showing Japanese soldiers bayoneting
Nanking victims. Ms. Chang said she was told that the authenticity
of the photograph was questionable because the shadows of the
figures appeared too short for the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Haga's correspondence indicates that he was also concerned about
the picture captions and wanted disclaimers that explained that
Kashiwashobo could not verify the authenticity of the pictures.
``If we publish the photos with caption translations exactly as
found in the original, we will surely be open for severe attack
from the right-wing conservatives, and we have no way to defend
ourselves,'' he wrote in November.
</P>
<P>
   With the termination of the contract, Basic Books announced that
it would seek another Japanese publisher. ``I want the Japanese
people to know the truth of the Rape of Nanking,'' Ms. Chang said.
``I want them to know a side of history that isn't properly taught
in school. Like it or not, this is a part of their history.''

`THIS LIME TREE BOWER': A WEALTH OF AMBIGUITY, AN ECONOMY OF
WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ray, a hard-drinking Lothario of a college professor
in Conor McPherson's ``This Lime Tree Bower,'' is not a fancy
talker, at least not by academic standards. His sentences and his
words tend to be short, but they nonetheless summon entire
landscapes of sharp, conflicted sensations.
</P>
<P>
   Here, for example, is Ray identifying a crystalline moment of
guilt, as he recalls driving through the Irish countryside with his
steady girlfriend: ``Carmel beside me in a light print dress and my
mind wandering into different beds.''
</P>
<P>
   The image of the promiscuous mind is good, but it's that ``light
print dress'' next to it that makes this sentence fragment explode
with impressions, conveying both Ray's idealizing view of his lover
and the luxury he finds in feeling bad and lowdown. Just 15 words,
and you're securely inside someone else's head.
</P>
<P>
   McPherson, an Irish playwright still several years away from 30,
and the author of ``The Weir,'' the haunted tribute to storytelling
now on Broadway, consistently brings to blooming life what English
teachers were always telling you about economy of means in writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Lime Tree Bower,'' a story unfolded in alternating
monologues by three men, hasn't been done many favors by the
uncomfortable production that opened Wednesday night at Primary
Stages. But McPherson's language is potent enough to survive even
this sadly awkward rendering, and images and phrases from the work
take on their own proliferating existence in your memory afterward.
``These books knew how to be read,'' a character in ``Lime Tree''
says of his favorite detective novels. The same might be said of
McPherson's plays.
</P>
<P>
   In summary, the plot of ``This Lime Tree Bower'' brings to mind
those sweet-natured foreign films distributed here under the rubric
of ``quirky'' and ``life-affirming.'' It's a small-town
coming-of-age tale that features both an exotic introduction to sex
and an antic robbery at gunpoint that is pulled off by one of the
play's narrators. The victim of that crime is, of course,
dislikable and humiliated in ways that involve public nudity.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are shadows in ``Lime Tree'' that movies like ``The
Full Monty'' don't begin to capture. McPherson uses words to create
both a buzzing sense of atmosphere and an equally vibrant silence
beneath that pulses with unanswerable questions. ``Lime Tree'' has
its elements of excessively cute eccentricity, but it also finds a
troubled ambivalence in each of its characters that is the province
of first-class literature.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a performance style to convey that ambiguity isn't easy,
as is unfortunately evidenced by this production, directed by
Harris Yulin and performed by T.R. Knight and Thomas Lyons, as
brothers on the edge of manhood, and Drew McVety as the college
professor who goes out with their sister. These three actors are
likable, eager presences, but you're often conscious of the sheer
effort they put into sustaining their accents and remembering their
long, rambling speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently the production feels pitched self-consciously in a
no man's land between a staged reading and fully realized
characterizations. What should be a rolling river of language
becomes instead something dry and fitful. Each actor, especially
McVety as the libidinous Ray, has his moments, and they are sure to
improve with time. For now, however, you often have to look past
the performances to find the gold in McPherson's text.
</P>
<P>
   Gold there definitely is. Though it uses multiple narrators,
``Lime Tree'' doesn't go for obvious ``Rashomon''-style differences
of interpretation. What McPherson aims for is both simpler and more
subtle, indirectly contrasting the senses of self and of sexuality
of the play's three characters, who are in different stages of
defining their personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, though stranded in sybaritic adolescence, is the most fully
formed. Joe ( Knight), who is still in school, retains a wondering,
waiting quality, while Frank ( Lyons), his older brother, has
reached the point of restlessness where he needs to bolt. The form
that restlessness takes is what gives the play its anecdotal shape.
</P>
<P>
   McPherson asks you to exercise a certain skepticism about what
you're hearing. ``The town was full of spoofers,'' as young Joe
observes, adding that his Italian father has warned him that Irish
people are just as likely as not to ``make something up'' when
something needs explaining.
</P>
<P>
   What a person fabricates, however, can be more illuminating than
a more straightforward recitation of events. And when Joe recalls,
in Gothic terms, his first vision of people having sex, its mixture
of repulsion and fascination rings resoundingly true.
</P>
<P>
   Joe is also the one who discourses on the pleasures of paperback
thrillers and westerns. He likes them, he says, because ``the
sentences were always short'' and ``the writers gave you the
facts.'' In contrast, he says, in the books he studied in school,
``nobody said what they meant and you had to work out what
everybody wanted.'' Then there are those rare writers like
McPherson, who seamlessly blend the virtues of both camps.

JESSYE NORMAN AND BILL T. JONES CREATE A PERFORMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FELICIA R. LEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was a moment in rehearsal, Bill T. Jones said,
when his partner Jessye Norman used her voice to say something
about herself that went beyond words and music. She started out
with an opera, slid into something jazzy and then ambled into a
land of soulful notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``She gave me this look,'' Jones recalled the other day over a
lazy lunch in midtown. ``I think, that as African-American artists
working in very Eurocentric environments, it was her way of saying,
`I am in touch with who I am.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Norman, the soprano, and Jones, the choreographer and
dancer, are collaborators on a performance called ``How! Do! We!
Do!,'' which will have its world premiere Monday and will be
repeated next Thursday at City Center. The show promises to be as
provocative and hard-to-categorize as the artists: It is just the
two of them onstage, creating a mosaic of song, dance, poetry and
the spoken word in a series of tableaux with readings of Frank
O'Hara poems forming the narrative thread.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years I've been interested in Frank O'Hara,'' Jones said
of the poet, playwright and art critic. ``His voice is urbane,
passionate, cultivated, capable of deep lyrical flights and the
throwaway camp line.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he envisions ``How! Do! We! Do!'' as a poem open to
interpretation, an exploration of two personalities. At one point
Ms. Norman imitates a radio tuning into pivotal moments in modern
history, especially the civil rights struggle. Ms. Norman and Jones
do a dance that is meant to evoke both the travel of Africans to
the New World and the travels of all immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The vocal music will be both live and recorded and range from
Duke Ellington to Mozart to American spirituals to Schubert lieder.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing is creating a new programming genre which
links the classical music world with the world of theater and dance
in Lincoln Center's New Visions series,'' said Jane Moss, vice
president for programming at Lincoln Center. Lincoln Center is
renting City Center for the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It defies categorization,'' Ms. Moss said. ``Hearing Jessye
Norman with Bill T. Jones is completely different from hearing her
in recital.''
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps fitting that O'Hara's voice informs the duet,
because he felt that poetry should be ``between two persons instead
of two pages.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides coming from different disciplines, Ms. Norman is
famously private and Jones is famously extroverted. She is a large
woman known as a diva. He has a dancer's body and is known for
using spoken language on the stage and addressing issues like
racism and AIDS in his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I needed a title that would hold whatever we do,''
Jones said of this latest endeavor. ``How! is how we became Jessye,
how we became Bill, how we became friends. Do! is a way of being in
the world that is action-oriented. We! is who we are together.
People will try to figure us out together, this man and this women
who have their level of reputation and notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Do! is movement-driven, text-driven, music-driven.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Norman said she saw the show as a chance to explore themes
that are close to her heart: the civil rights movement, the
anti-apartheid struggle, the moment Hank Aaron broke Babe Ruth's
major league career home-run record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to bring attention to certain social issues,'' Ms.
Norman said. ``I do movement and I'm very comfortable with it. The
first time, I was giggling the whole time and saying, `Bill, you're
not serious.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was on the verge of singing,'' she said, leaning forward
with a mischievous twinkle in her eye. ``We put the flame out on
that idea.''
</P>
<P>
   The project started 10 years ago after they met and decided to
do something together. The show evolved with many conversations and
hours of listening to music.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who formed the post-modernist Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane
Dance Company in 1982 with his companion and saw it reach
international prominence, has created dances for Alvin Ailey Dance
Theater and the Berlin Opera Ballet, among others, and
choreographed for opera houses, including the New York City Opera.
Zane died in 1988. These days the peripatetic Jones' is promoting a
new book of photographs by Zane called ``Continuous Replay: The
Photographs of Arnie Zane, 1970-1980.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Norman, who grew up in Augusta, Ga., started her career in
Europe and returned to the United States to become one of the first
major black stars of the opera world since Marian Anderson. Even
though her official biography does not even include her marital
status, her persona has received almost as much attention as her
voice.
</P>
<P>
   She has been quoted in articles as using the royal ``we,'' for
example, and is sometimes described as imperious. There was a
flurry of articles a few years ago about a lawsuit she brought
against a British magazine for telling a story about her being
trapped in a revolving door and being advised to go sideways. The
magazine quoted her as saying: ``Honey, I ain't got no sideways.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Norman said the other day that the story was old and may
have originally been about a German singer. She never said it, she
reiterated, even though she lost the lawsuit. She said that she
felt the fabricated comment was a slap at all African-Americans, a
way of saying that to be black is to exist in the vernacular.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he knew Ms. Norman was aware of the paradox of her
position in a Eurocentric world, a theme he has explored in works
like ``The Last Supper at Uncle Tom's Cabin/The Promised Land.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not on a soapbox with `How! Do! We! Do!,''' Jones said.
``I'm enjoying this moment with Ms. Norman. I heard the jargon of
the '60s, an ancient jargon that is about freedom and defining
oneself. I want to make an art that is multilayered and
intellectually satisfying but that is encouraging to me and those
like me.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole time right now, this whole discourse right now, is
about negotiating differences. Do we all believe we have something
to learn? This exists on the political level and it exists on the
social level. Ms. Norman and I are developing a language of how to
speak to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Ms. Norman said she loathed interviews because she was
fiercely private (``I find it amazing that people would actually
allow a photographer into their home to take pictures,'' she said)
and because so much written about her has been untrue. She said she
believed her art could speak for itself without people knowing
about her love life or her bathroom color scheme. She said she was
tired of the diva anecdotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, people need to cultivate a mystique that is
comfortable for them,'' she said of her reputation. ``People write
things they think must be true or how they would be if they were in
my shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   In an hourlong interview, Ms. Norman laughed often and smiled
easily. This is who she said she is: ``not married, just happy'';
practices yoga, adores Toni Morrison and Duke Ellington, lives
modestly, never reads reviews (``It's not as if I'm going to get an
objective, helpful criticism''), allergic to pets, interested in
the spiritual and passionate about social justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``To work this way, to do something completely different, is a
strength, it's growth,'' Ms. Norman of the show with Jones, whom
she first met backstage at the Joyce Theater in Manhattan. ``I
learned to walk across a stage without teetering or tottering.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of my career as a kind of wheel,'' she continued.
``There are spokes going in all directions. I just find different
directions all the time. I'm going to do more popular music, for
example.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In 10 years, I'll probably spend more time writing,'' she
said, adding that she was rereading ``Paradise'' by Toni Morrison,
a lot about Duke Ellington and the second volume of a book about
Eleanor Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compassion was the most natural thing in the world to her,''
she said of Roosevelt. ``I want to look at the connection of the
spirit to what it is that we do. I like the way that whole thing
invades my life. One can be hesitant to talk about these things
because the people who have been vocal about these things have not
turned out to be the people we thought they were.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not pie-in-the-sky spirituality that moves her, either,
said Ms. Norman, who supports the Girl Scouts, children's charities
and AIDS research. She said she cares about any issue that touches
on people's lives.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said ``How! Do! We! Do!'' strives to capture the spirit of
these two artists who are as concerned with their art as they are
with how people manage to make it in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The piece wants to be a bit mad, deeply felt,'' he said.
``It's a mosaic. These two people who are friends and two artists
who respect each other using all these forms and images and music
to talk about the present, the past and even the future.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ray, a hard-drinking Lothario of a college professor
in Conor McPherson's ``This Lime Tree Bower,'' is not a fancy
talker, at least not by academic standards. His sentences and his
words tend to be short, but they nonetheless summon entire
landscapes of sharp, conflicted sensations.
</P>
<P>
   Here, for example, is Ray identifying a crystalline moment of
guilt, as he recalls driving through the Irish countryside with his
steady girlfriend: ``Carmel beside me in a light print dress and my
mind wandering into different beds.''
</P>
<P>
   The image of the promiscuous mind is good, but it's that ``light
print dress'' next to it that makes this sentence fragment explode
with impressions, conveying both Ray's idealizing view of his lover
and the luxury he finds in feeling bad and lowdown. Just 15 words,
and you're securely inside someone else's head.
</P>
<P>
   McPherson, an Irish playwright still several years away from 30,
and the author of ``The Weir,'' the haunted tribute to storytelling
now on Broadway, consistently brings to blooming life what English
teachers were always telling you about economy of means in writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Lime Tree Bower,'' a story unfolded in alternating
monologues by three men, hasn't been done many favors by the
uncomfortable production that opened Wednesday night at Primary
Stages. But McPherson's language is potent enough to survive even
this sadly awkward rendering, and images and phrases from the work
take on their own proliferating existence in your memory afterward.
``These books knew how to be read,'' a character in ``Lime Tree''
says of his favorite detective novels. The same might be said of
McPherson's plays.
</P>
<P>
   In summary, the plot of ``This Lime Tree Bower'' brings to mind
those sweet-natured foreign films distributed here under the rubric
of ``quirky'' and ``life-affirming.'' It's a small-town
coming-of-age tale that features both an exotic introduction to sex
and an antic robbery at gunpoint that is pulled off by one of the
play's narrators. The victim of that crime is, of course,
dislikable and humiliated in ways that involve public nudity.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are shadows in ``Lime Tree'' that movies like ``The
Full Monty'' don't begin to capture. McPherson uses words to create
both a buzzing sense of atmosphere and an equally vibrant silence
beneath that pulses with unanswerable questions. ``Lime Tree'' has
its elements of excessively cute eccentricity, but it also finds a
troubled ambivalence in each of its characters that is the province
of first-class literature.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a performance style to convey that ambiguity isn't easy,
as is unfortunately evidenced by this production, directed by
Harris Yulin and performed by T.R. Knight and Thomas Lyons, as
brothers on the edge of manhood, and Drew McVety as the college
professor who goes out with their sister. These three actors are
likable, eager presences, but you're often conscious of the sheer
effort they put into sustaining their accents and remembering their
long, rambling speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently the production feels pitched self-consciously in a
no man's land between a staged reading and fully realized
characterizations. What should be a rolling river of language
becomes instead something dry and fitful. Each actor, especially
McVety as the libidinous Ray, has his moments, and they are sure to
improve with time. For now, however, you often have to look past
the performances to find the gold in McPherson's text.
</P>
<P>
   Gold there definitely is. Though it uses multiple narrators,
``Lime Tree'' doesn't go for obvious ``Rashomon''-style differences
of interpretation. What McPherson aims for is both simpler and more
subtle, indirectly contrasting the senses of self and of sexuality
of the play's three characters, who are in different stages of
defining their personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, though stranded in sybaritic adolescence, is the most fully
formed. Joe ( Knight), who is still in school, retains a wondering,
waiting quality, while Frank ( Lyons), his older brother, has
reached the point of restlessness where he needs to bolt. The form
that restlessness takes is what gives the play its anecdotal shape.
</P>
<P>
   McPherson asks you to exercise a certain skepticism about what
you're hearing. ``The town was full of spoofers,'' as young Joe
observes, adding that his Italian father has warned him that Irish
people are just as likely as not to ``make something up'' when
something needs explaining.
</P>
<P>
   What a person fabricates, however, can be more illuminating than
a more straightforward recitation of events. And when Joe recalls,
in Gothic terms, his first vision of people having sex, its mixture
of repulsion and fascination rings resoundingly true.
</P>
<P>
   Joe is also the one who discourses on the pleasures of paperback
thrillers and westerns. He likes them, he says, because ``the
sentences were always short'' and ``the writers gave you the
facts.'' In contrast, he says, in the books he studied in school,
``nobody said what they meant and you had to work out what
everybody wanted.'' Then there are those rare writers like
McPherson, who seamlessly blend the virtues of both camps.

 &HT;    FROM MIGRANT WORKER, SHE ROSE TO KEY WHITE HOUSE ROLE
 &HT;    For release Sunday, May 23.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Maria Echaveste was talking about patriotism in her
White House office, which is a short stroll from President
Clinton's desk but an odyssey away from the dusty cotton fields of
south Texas where her story began.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to work in this country to make sure that when you say
the word 'American,' it includes, in your head, all the things that
we are,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can it be that even in Latino communities, if you're
talking among yourselves, you say 'los Americanos' as a shorthand
way of saying 'the other, the white Americans,' even though we're
all Americans? Somehow we've taken in that they're Americans; we're
Mexican-Americans,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you know, excuse me, I'm really proud to be Mexican. I'm
really glad to know where I came from. But I'm American.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the White House deputy chief of staff personifies the
melting pot.
</P>
<P>
   Echaveste, 45, is ``sort of a one-woman band of diversity,'' the
New Republic noted. ``She's a Hispanic woman, a Jew, a corporate
lawyer, a Californian, a Texan, a New Yorker, a marathon runner,
and a gardener. Oh yes, she also knits.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing she's not, though, is a Southern good ol' boy _ which
helped get her hired by Erskine Bowles, the North Carolina
businessman who was serving as Clinton's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have very different backgrounds. That's another reason
why I wanted to bring her in,'' Bowles recalled. ``If you have
people with different backgrounds, people with different life
experiences, people from different cultures, people of different
races and genders, you're going to make a better decision than if
you just have 10 white guys sitting around a table.''
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of migrant farm workers, Echaveste has reached a
White House position never before attained by a Hispanic woman. In
the past six years, she has risen steadily through the
administration ranks _ from the Labor Department's wage and hour
administrator to White House director of public liaison to deputy
chief of staff. A cabinet position could be next. She has been
rumored to be a contender for secretary of education should Richard
Riley decide to return to South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think she's at the highest position she's going to end
up at,'' predicted Bowles. ``If she decides to stay in the
administration, I think Maria is destined for a seat at the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Maria was the eldest of the seven Echaveste children. Their
parents had crossed the Rio Grande in the early 1950s to find a
better life, and Maria was born in Harlingen, Texas. Her father
couldn't read or write back then. He was taught by her mother, who
had finished the second grade. But they were bright and ambitious,
hard workers who earned their citizenship and moved to California
in search of higher wages.
</P>
<P>
   The children grew up following ripening crops across California,
picking cotton, strawberries, grapes, tomatoes and carrots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lived out in the country on farms,'' recalled Rosa, the
middle child of five girls and two boys. ``We did not have a lot of
toys or material things. But Maria was really imaginative. We did
these elaborate shows and plays for each other. And we played
school. She was always the teacher, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   For almost longer than she can remember, books were central in
Maria's childhood. She spent as much time as she could in the
libraries of schools and agricultural communities.
</P>
<P>
   Books would open the door to a life beyond the aching backs and
merciless sun and endless fields and orchards. But her early
academic awareness wasn't the only reason that Maria was always the
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being the oldest child and having the responsibility of caring
for all the little ones, she had to grow up fast,'' said Carmella,
the third-born of the Echaveste children. ``Those experiences
interfered with her childhood. The term we use now is 'parentified'
_ a child expected to be a substitute parent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She definitely was a parental figure,'' agreed Rosa. ``If we
did anything wrong, we feared her reaction as well as our
parents'.''
</P>
<P>
   The patriarchal household stressed traditional Mexican and
Catholic values. At times, there was a culture clash between the
stern, Spanish-speaking father and his Americanized children. He
did not want his eldest daughter to go off to college, even after
she earned a scholarship to Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was angry,'' said Carmella, now a social worker in
Pasadena. ``My mother told her, 'go, and I'll work on your dad
while you're gone'.''
</P>
<P>
   With Maria leading the way, six of the seven Echaveste children
went on to earn college degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the guiding light,'' said Rosa, now an insurance
broker in southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the parents followed the example set by their
offspring and became avid readers. Refugio Echaveste advanced to
become a ranch foreman, joining the vast American middle class
before retiring and returning with his wife, Maria, to live in the
Mexican town of Jalisco where he was born.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   At Stanford, Maria Echaveste majored in anthropology and might
have gone on to graduate study and an academic career except for a
tight job market in her field. Instead, she spent a year in the
nation's capital interning with the U.S. Commission on Civil
Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Envisioning a government job, she earned a law degree from the
University of California at Berkeley. But instead of returning to
Washington, she became a corporate attorney in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed it immensely,'' she said, describing the challenge
of winning courtroom battles. And the practice was lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've added up how much money I've lost in the last six years
being in government,'' she said. ``It's a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, she married Stanley Schlein, a Bronx attorney. She
also converted to her husband's religion _ Orthodox Judaism. She
has since divorced but remained Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised a Catholic and had a very hard time with
Catholicism, which was the source of another battle with my parents
when I started not to go to church,'' she said. She considered the
religion _ ``the way it was in my house'' _ to be confining to
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very suffocating. You're someone's mother, someone's
sister, someone's daughter. You're not a person in your own
right,'' she explained. ``It's also very focused on the hereafter,
as opposed to now. And especially, I think, in a Mexican household,
there's a lot of resignation. It's 'whatever God wills'.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found Judasim to be much more life-affirming. This is our
time. It's about what you do every day, about how you use the
blessings that you have every day and what you do with this life
now, not what's going happen to you post-death.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, she became active in Democratic politics and served
as president of the city's Board of Elections. During the 1992
presidential campaign, she left her law firm to become the national
Latino coordinator for the Clinton team. Her White House position,
she concedes with a chuckle, is directly attributable to picking a
winning candidate.
</P>
<P>
   She joined the new administration and became wage and hour
administrator, a Labor Department position requiring Senate
confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   The job is powerful but obscure _ overseeing minimum wage laws,
child labor laws and the newly passed family medical leave act,
said Tom Glynn, a Boston hospital administrator who is a former
deputy secretary of labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``She could have been chief of staff for the attorney general,''
Glynn said. ``Given that choice, most people would have gone to the
Justice Department. But she was very committed to the issues
concerning working people. She ended up handling a lot of hot
potatoes.''
</P>
<P>
   She led a project that obtained $8 million in back wages for
poor workers who had been illegally underpaid by their employers.
And she pushed an anti-sweatshop crusade to press retailers and
clothes makers to improve the working conditions at the facilities
of their apparel contractors.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of Clinton's second term in 1997, Echaveste moved
over to the White House as public liaison director, responsible for
boosting support for presidential policies and initiatives. She
replaced Alexis Herman, who had been appointed secretary of labor.
</P>
<P>
   Among Echaveste's projects was the presidential initiative to
provoke a ``national dialogue'' on race relations to prepare the
nation for a future without any racial majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have criticized (the initiative) as an issue
that started out big and is going nowhere,'' she said. However, she
predicted that ``some years from now, what the president did by
putting this issue about how we relate to each other across racial
and ethnic and religious lines will be seen as the big deal it
really is.''
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1998, Echaveste was promoted to deputy chief of
staff. The job entails ``managing the White House,'' she explained.
Her duties have ranged from routine administration _ deciding who
gets raises _ to coordinating the State of the Union speech and
planning the Wye River summit to negotiate Mideast peace and the
50th anniversary NATO conference.
</P>
<P>
   The air war over Yugoslavia forced a drastic revision of the
original plans for a celebratory NATO summit, said Doug Sosnik,
presidential assistant for policy and strategy. At every progress
meeting, Echaveste had to keep pushing for changes, warning,
``people, read the paper,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like turning a huge ship around'' to produce a
successful session that was completely different from the
celebrity-filled gala initially envisioned, Sosnik said.
</P>
<P>
   Echaveste gets things done, said Bowles, her former boss.
``There are a lot of people in Washington, I found, who understand
policy. But I didn't find many who could translate that policy into
action. She's both a leader and a doer _ again a rare
combination.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Echaveste said she is thankful for the opportunity to
work 12 hours a day, seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be able to participate in some of the decisions that have
to be made around here is something that I take very seriously,''
she explained. ``It's not about the trappings of, 'Oh, I work in
the White House.' Or, 'Oh, I got invited to some fancy state
dinner'. Or, 'Oh, my goodness, I get to travel on Air Force One.'
It's about, 'Okay, you had a really interesting session on school
violence on Monday. Now how are we going to organize this into a
national campaign?'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a chance to work on something that can make people's
lives better,'' she said. ``I hope that doesn't sound too corny.''

   PHOENIX - Julia Roberts lifted up her arm to wave to the crowd
and, in turn, the world froze.
</P>
<P>
   It was the lead story on ``Inside Edition,'' ``Entertainment
Tonight'' and even, believe it or not, made the nightly news. The
newscasters gasped in horror and snickered in revulsion as the
photo of Roberts was flashed the screen for five haunting seconds.
</P>
<P>
   There, just beneath her cap-sleeved gown was not evidence of a
budding extra head; the expanding, flapping gills of a fish woman;
or even a tumor equivalent in girth and color tone to a ripe, juicy
melon. Nope.
</P>
<P>
   It was just hair.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Roberts had the armpits of a ring-tailed lemur.
</P>
<P>
   One local newscaster's brain was apparently seized by a
brilliance bubble as she mentioned aloud, ``I bet she just forgot
to shave. She (begin ital) couldn't (end ital) have done that on
purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Let me be the first one to explain: When you've got enough fur
sprouting from within a fold of flesh to clothe a badger, it's
really not something that slips your mind _ especially when it's
long enough to weave beads and brightly colored bits of yarn into
and makes noise when you walk. Take it from one who knows.
</P>
<P>
   I also know a story like that has (begin ital) got (end ital) to
be important when it disrupts coverage of Pamela Anderson's
silicone baggie reduction from the size of a monster-truck tire to
that of an 18-wheeler. I imagine the world is just relieved to know
that she can finally reach across that continental divide she calls
a chest and feed herself again.
</P>
<P>
   I guess if there's anything that can knock a big, fat boob out
of the spotlight, it's gotta be a hairy monkey armpit.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose now it will become the hip Hollywood ``thing,'' maybe
replacing the trends of lips pumped full of Fix-A-Flat or wearing
sheer dresses but no underpants.
</P>
<P>
   But that's all right by me. I don't need any excuse to throw
down my Lady Bic, I can be a lemming! I was just waiting for a
Hollywood's highest-paid actress to come along and say it was OK to
liberate our armpits from the heavy chains of razors and wax.
</P>
<P>
   Those who sent their follicles to an early grave via
electrolysis will become the jealous scourge, as women all over the
world raise their arms and shout, ``A pretty woman is a pretty
hairy woman!!'' After all, isn't it just another place where we can
place our diamond-encrusted bobby pins?
</P>
<P>
   If Julia Roberts can capture the attention of the WHOLE WORLD by
unveiling a beard in her pit, think of the hidden powers she
contains. Clearly, she alone has the ability to turn all of the
taboo behaviors into acceptable social icons. Why let the magic
stop here? Let's let it all hang out, sister-woman!
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'm happy to see Julia endorse something that my
mother considers barnyard animal hygiene. In fact, I'd like to see
her build a couple of more bridges to free humanity of tiresome
social restraints and dismiss notions of socially unacceptable
behavior. Because if Julia does it, it (begin ital) must (end ital)
be OK. Let's really give the media something to talk about!
</P>
<P>
   At her next premiere, I implore Julia to walk down that red
carpet with her left hand prying her panties out of the crack of
her behind.
</P>
<P>
   I beg her to be photographed wearing sandals that expose
toenails so long that they curl over and scrape the ground and can
shred flesh.
</P>
<P>
   I want her to tell a trashy tabloid or ``Good Housekeeping''
that, instead of washing her underwear, she simply turns it inside
out.
</P>
<P>
   I want her to admit to Barbara Walters that she eats chocolate
like it was a vitamin.
</P>
<P>
   I want to see her at the Academy Awards next year, talking to
Joan Rivers about her designer dress, when she lifts one hip,
concentrates so hard that her face gets all squished up, and pushes
out a poot.
</P>
<P>
   I want her to be on ``Oprah'' when she suddenly starts to squirm
and magically produces a bra from the cuff of her shirt sleeve as
she giggles and says, ``That just totally itched! Can I put this in
somebody's purse?''
</P>
<P>
   I want her to admit that she, too, in pursuit of a particularly
irritating crusty, has stuck her finger up her nose and then
examined it without realizing she was in a crowded grocery line.
</P>
<P>
   I want her to confess that when her left and right brain
communicate with each other, sometimes it gets broadcast out loud.
</P>
<P>
   I want her to insist that she's melted down her tweezer for the
war effort and is ``so over'' plucking old lady hairs from her
chin.
</P>
<P>
   But dangers lurk.
</P>
<P>
   All of this Julia Mania could cause a jealous backlash with
other flavor-of-the-season celebs. Out of spite, Pam Anderson could
shove a river raft into her torso; Camryn Manheim might throw a
perfectly good Twinkie away; and Calista Flockhart might consider
the unholy by picking it up and eating it. In front of people.
</P>
<P>
   That's OK. Julia Mania can be revived. It (begin ital) can. (end
ital) If you think the world froze when she lifted up her arms and
the camera spotted it, prepare for the apocalypse this summer when
she's spotted on the beach.

GERMAN OPPOSITION TO GROUND TROOPS MAKES CONTINUED AIR WAR LIKELY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Despite some diplomatic progress, the NATO bombardment
of Yugoslavia is likely to continue at least until the end of this
month, a senior German official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Steiner, the chief diplomatic adviser to Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder, said that a minimum of two weeks would be needed
to overcome differences between Russia and the West, and to bring
the Yugoslav government ``to the level of vulnerability where it
will agree to our demands.''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks, in a telephone interview, reflected a German
conviction that the NATO policy of bombing combined with diplomacy
will work if given time, and that using ground troops would be a
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my view that we will not deploy ground troops in
Yugoslavia,'' Schroeder, a Social Democrat, said Wednesday in an
interview with German television. He was repeating a position that
he has forcefully taken this week as Britain has called for
preparation for the possible use of troops to force a military
victory in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The German view, critical because Schroeder has been
coordinating the European response to the war, reflects historical
and political factors that make Germany's position unique and
appear to limit NATO's options.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since World War II, the maxim that ``only peace'' would go
out from German soil has amounted to a mantra, repeated by
governments of the left and right alike. German participation in
the NATO bombardment of Yugoslavia therefore amounts to a huge
departure, after which ground troops appear as a step too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``By German standards, the change of policy has already been
extensive and radical,'' said Karl Kaiser, a political analyst.
``We have come a huge distance in a short time, and managed to
bring public opinion along. But for the government, ground troops
would be too much at this stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Public support for the war has declined to 51 percent from 61
percent a month ago, according to an opinion poll published last
week. The strong pacifist strain in German politics and opinion has
begun to resurface.
</P>
<P>
   As the tide of opinion has begun to shift, the Green Party,
junior partners in Schroeder's government, has become more forceful
in seeking an end to the bombing, calling last week for a pause in
air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting strains in the coalition are such that it appears
probable that any eventual NATO decision to use ground troops would
bring down the first ``Red-Green'' government of the modern German
state.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor in the German position is that the main
opposition party, the center-right Christian Democratic Union, has
up to now supported the NATO bombing, opening the way for a
bi-partisan approach that would be reassuring to a country still
alarmed by the prospect of sharp internal divisions over a European
war. But the Christian Democrats, the party of former Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, has said it will oppose a ground war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not weaken on the military side, but equally we must
not change strategy that is making headway,'' Steiner said. ``We
have to be steadfast, with no mixed signals, and then perhaps in a
couple of weeks we will get where we want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Steiner spoke as senior officials from the Group of Seven
wealthiest nations and Russia met in Bonn to try to build on a
statement earlier this month that called for the deployment in
Kosovo of international ``civil and security presences'' and the
withdrawal of Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, issued on May 6, marked the first time since the
bombing began two months ago that Russia and the West had spoken
with a single voice. But it left open several contentious issues,
including the composition of any international force, the
circumstances in which NATO bombing would stop, and whether all
Serbian forces have to pull out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the meeting Wednesday, which was attended by
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, was not intended to
resolve all those issues, but was part of a process that would
still take some time and should eventually lead to a U.N. Security
Council resolution on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   One basic difference remaining is the Russian and Chinese
insistence that NATO's bombing must stop before a diplomatic
solution can be found. This demand is rejected by the United States
and its allies, which insist that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic must first accept the deployment of a NATO-coordinated
international force and withdraw his troops from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Mayorsky, the Russian delegate to the Bonn meeting, said
Wednesday that peace depended on NATO stopping the bombing. ``The
Russian position, as before, is that a condition for such a
resolution is an end to the bombing of the territory of Yugoslavia
by NATO forces,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. resolution would spell out the conditions for and
perhaps the broad composition of any international force. It would
in effect give such a mission the firm basis in international law
that critics have argued the NATO campaign lacks.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Steiner said the diplomatic efforts were focused on a new word:
``synchronization.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, diplomats are looking at the possibility of having
the beginning of a withdrawal of Yugoslav forces coincide with a
provisional halt to NATO bombing, the passing of a U.N. Security
Council resolution, and the start of a deployment of international
forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   This is a highly complex and time-consuming aim. But if
achieved, it might allow all sides to claim a bit of a victory and
so break the current impasse.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the Russian envoy to the
Balkans, would raise that sort of possibility with Milosevic in
Belgrade on Wednesday. As for Western countries, they have decided
to coordinate their diplomatic efforts through the Finnish
president, Martti Ahtisaari, who may eventually travel to the
Yugoslav capital, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Ahtisaari comes from a country that is in the European Union but
not in NATO and, having worked on the conflict in Bosnia for some
time, is familiar with the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone from Washington to European capitals is agreed that
Mr. Ahtisaari will now be a central figure as the diplomacy moves
forward,'' Steiner said. ``He knows the NATO position and he shares
it.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But it remains open to question whether NATO will be able to
maintain its unity as that diplomacy moves forward at a modest
pace, and whether Milosevic can be brought to yield to demands that
still include the withdrawal of all Serb forces from Kosovo and a
strong NATO presence there.
</P>
<P>
   That question is particularly acute because Germany's history
insures that one option that might increase pressure on Milosevic _
the use of ground troops _ is highly unlikely to be adopted by
NATO. Or, if it were, Germany would remain on the sidelines, with
unpredictable repercussions.

SPIN ABOUT BUSH'S ROLE IN GOP GUN DEBATE TAKES LIFE OF ITS OWN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
and R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To hear some people tell it, when Gov. George W. Bush says
``Jump!'' Republicans in Washington ask, ``How high?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Bush leads in the Republican presidential polls. Yes, he's
widely respected by Republicans in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But reports and rumors notwithstanding, Bush apparently was not
the moving force when Senate Republicans reversed course last week
and supported instant background checks for arms purchasers at gun
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Bush.
</P>
<P>
   He told reporters Wednesday in Austin, Texas, that he received a
call from a Republican senator and expressed support for the
provision to require the background checks. Bush spokesman David
Beckwith said the call, from Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, came before
any Senate vote on gun-show checks _ not as Republicans were
deciding to do a U-turn.
</P>
<P>
   The phone call, however, has taken on a life of its own.
</P>
<P>
   On ABC's Sunday interview show ``This Week,'' columnist George
Will quizzed Sen. Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican who chairs the
Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator, it is rumored one of the reasons Republicans changed
their vote between Wednesday and Friday, I guess, is that there was
a call from Austin, Texas, from Governor Bush's operation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that I know of,'' Hatch replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``No contact whatever?'' Will pressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' Hatch said. ``Not that I knew of.''
</P>
<P>
   But the idea would not die.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the show, commentator William Kristol, editor of the
Weekly Standard, said: ``Well, the Republicans reversed themselves,
I'm told, under pressure from Austin from George W. Bush's aides.
Bush did not want to run as the party that had killed gun locks
..., the party that had legitimized gun shows. All that sort of
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckwith, in a chronology supported by Craig's spokesman Will
Hart, said Craig was on the Senate floor when Sen. Frank
Lautenburg, D-N.J., claimed Bush supported mandatory background
checks on gun purchasers at shows _ just as if the sale were at a
gun shop. Requiring a background check was part of a Lautenberg
proposal in competition with a measure by Craig.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Sarah Brady, George W. Bush, (Rep.) Henry Hyde, gun
manufacturers and gun dealers get behind closing a loophole, I
think everybody here ought to listen, and we ought to close it,''
Lautenberg said in Senate debate.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg spokesman Mark Nevins said Lautenberg's statement was
based on published reports of Bush's recently announced support for
background checks at gun shows and that the senator had not
contacted Bush or his office. Bush confirmed the point in a news
conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Beckwith said that when Craig, who opposes mandatory checks at
gun shows, heard Lautenberg's statement, he went to a cloakroom off
the Senate floor and called Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Beckwith said Bush and Craig discussed the bills. The spokesman
said Bush told Craig he would prefer the Republican's proposal over
the Democrats' but repeated his support for mandatory background
checks at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Hart said Craig apparently never referred to his conversation
with Bush during the ensuing debate.
</P>
<P>
   Beckwith said the only other contact between the Bush and Craig
offices on the gun-show point came last Thursday when he asked an
aide to phone Craig's staff and ask for copies of the two measures.
</P>
<P>
   But word of the Craig-Bush phone conversation _ apparently with
some embellishments _ made the rounds in the Senate cloakrooms.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Senate Republicans changed their minds and voted
Friday for the mandatory background checks, Bush's alleged role in
the switch was being set in stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably gives Bush more credit than he's due, but such is
the advantage of being a front-runner in a presidential race,''
said a Senate Democratic source.
</P>
<P>
   The spin about Bush's power amuses the governor and his aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Craig) call came before any votes at all,'' Beckwith
said. ``I tried to point that out'' to at least one national
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   By the weekend Bush's supposedly pivotal role and influence was
firming up as gospel on a nationally televised program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This juggernaut is getting mythic proportions,'' Beckwith
declared in mock triuphmalism. ``I mean, we can do anything.''

HOUSTON BALLET HAS RAISED THE BARRE FOR TEXAS COMPANIES
</HEADLINE>
 
EDS: Has sidebar, HOUSTON-STEVENSON (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Ben Stevenson was a young dancer touring with a
British company the first time he saw Houston, in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stayed at the Shamrock Hilton, which was a glamorous new
hotel then,'' he says. ``It was out in the country in those days,
and we thought we were in the wild, wild west.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he returned, two decades later, Stevenson was a
renowned choreographer and teacher who had just been named artistic
director of the Houston Ballet. And he began the work of turning a
small, regional company into one of the success stories of American
ballet.
</P>
<P>
   It's a story with plenty of lessons for the Fort Worth-Dallas
region. The rise of Fort Worth Dallas Ballet in the past decade,
and its successful weathering of last year's resignation of its
artistic director, are admirable. However, although the Fort
Worth-Dallas area is comparable in size to Houston, we still lag
far behind Houston's company in budget, company size and national
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston company has more than twice the annual budget of
ours and not quite twice as many dancers, with a reputation built
on national and international tours, and a repertoire rich in
lavish productions of old and new ballets.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Stevenson began touring nationally, staging new
productions of classics and substantial world premieres that have
become a part of the Houston Ballet tradition. New works that
Houston Ballet has premiered under Stevenson include ``The Snow
Maiden,'' ``Dracula'' and ``Peer Gynt;'' new versions of classics
include ``Romeo and Juliet,'' ``Cinderella'' and ``Sleeping
Beauty.'' A new full-length ballet titled ``Cleopatra'' will be
premiered next year. The company has appeared in Europe, in China
and at important U.S. venues, including the Metropolitan Opera
House in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Ballet success story began in 1976. Having risen to
a position of respect as a teacher and choreographer on both sides
of the Atlantic in the 1960s, Stevenson was without a job when the
Chicago company he worked for folded _ at the same time the small,
young company in Houston had announced it needed an artistic
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in New York told me not to apply,'' Stevenson says.
But instead, he made an ambitious proposal: He wanted to build,
over a period of decades, a genuine Houston-based company that
would not depend on guest artists.
</P>
<P>
   To his surprise, the board agreed. But that was only the first
obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studio was a closet,'' he says. Prominent supporters built
a facility for him, which was followed in 1984 by the current
facility, a spacious, light-filled converted shoe factory near
downtown, supplemented by rehearsal space at the downtown Wortham
Center, where the company performs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were two audiences in Houston,'' Stevenson says. ``The
ones who were loyal to the Houston Ballet, and the ones who wanted
to see guest companies. We have stood our ground.''
</P>
<P>
   But even success stories have moments of crisis _ or, in the
case of the Houston Ballet, budget problems. In 1995, the company's
long-term deficit reached $400,000; worse than that, the company
had to be ``rescued'' at the end of several seasons with intensive
fund-raising drives.
</P>
<P>
   Executive Director Cecil Conner arrived during the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized that we couldn't do a year-end campaign every
year,'' Conner says. ``Instead of budgeting on the basis of `Here's
what we want to spend,' we realized we had to budget based on
`Here's how much money we have, how shall we spend it?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The hardest part was cutting the corps from 56 dancers to 46.
</P>
<P>
   Under Conner, the long-term deficit has disappeared, and the
annual budget has returned to $11.2 million annually, close to the
pre-crisis level. Equally important, the endowment has reached $30
million, very close to the ideal endowment-to-budget ratio of
3-to-1. The subscription season was cut from seven to six
performances and the minimum number of performances dropped from
seven to six; the company discovered that by having fewer
performances, it could keep its income steady while lowering
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the dance boom of the 1970s and 1980s, we thought dance
would grow forever. Then, in the 1990s, everyone had to cut back,''
Conner says. ``Now, we know that growth is not the only criterion
for success.''
</P>
<P>
   No single element has been responsible for the success of the
Houston Ballet. The continuity of personnel on Stevenson's artistic
staff has been important _ he has staffers whom he has known since
his London days _ along with his devotion to building a school.
Now, Stevenson can say with confidence that there is a ``Houston
look'' in his company _ descended from but not exactly the same as
the British school of ballet he learned.
</P>
<P>
   New ideas in fund-raising have also been significant. Houston
Ballet supporters invented the ``Nutcracker Market,'' a
holiday-time boutique concept that has been picked up by other
companies, including Fort Worth Dallas Ballet. Houston's
``Nutcracker Market'' grosses $6 million annually in sales,
providing an impressive net profit of $1 million. And community
support has been crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Houston proves that a major ballet company can thrive in Texas.
The question now is whether Fort Worth and Dallas can match or even
exceed Houston's accomplishment.

MEET BEN STEVENSON, THE MAN WHO PUT HOUSTON ON ITS TOES
</HEADLINE>
 
EDS: SIDER with HOUSTON-BALLET (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Houston Ballet Artistic Director Ben Stevenson is, like the
company he directs, a study in versatility, perseverance and
imagination, with a talent for taking advantage of opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1936 in the British coastal town of Portsmouth, the son
of a bus driver and a florist, he started studying ballet at 7.
</P>
<P>
   His mother and sister ``were crazy about opera and ballet,'' he
says. Knock-kneed, he was encouraged to study dance by a doctor
whose daughter had cured a similar problem with ballet classes.
</P>
<P>
   But the ballet classes did more than cure bad legs: By 15, he
was good enough to win a government grant to go to London for
advanced study. There, his hallmark versatility emerged early on
when he was a member of the touring Ballet Arts Theatre company, an
outgrowth of the ``Ballet for Beginners'' TV program, and a dancer
in West End musicals. But classical ballet continued to call him
back, and he danced with the Sadlers Wells Ballet, the Festival
Ballet of London and the Sadlers Wells Opera Ballet _ as well as in
productions of ``The Boys From Syracuse'' and ``The Music Man'' and
other musicals of the era.
</P>
<P>
   While Stevenson was at the Festival Ballet in London, he
choreographed ``The Sleeping Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Sleeping Beauty'' was a success, a change of company
management put Stevenson out of work; a friend encouraged him to
visit New York. Within two weeks, his skills as a teacher of dance
were discovered; he became director of the Harkness Youth Dancers,
which eventually became the main Harkness Company, which
specialized in new ballets in a classical style. There, Stevenson
produced his first original ballet, ``Three Preludes,'' to music of
Rachmaninoff. The piece premiered with the company on tour in
Dallas, and has since become a part of the international dance
repertoire.

   &UR; By RABBI ELI HECHT &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   On Friday morning, May 21, Jews worldwide will celebrate a
holiday called Shavuoth. The highlight of the holiday is attending
synagogue and listening to the revelation of God in the form of the
Ten Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jewish tradition this event happened some 3,311
years ago on Mt. Sinai. The story is read from a hand-written
scroll called the Torah. Since the event took place 50 days after
the Jewish exodus from Egyptian slavery, the holiday is also called
Pentecost, meaning fifty.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the holiday marks the birthday of the Ten
Commandments and the Hebrew Bible called the Torah.
</P>
<P>
   Whether one believes that the special covenant between God and
the Hebrews was passed on to the church, called New Hebrews, or to
the Islamic religion, the Hebrew Bible remains supreme and
respected by all religions. It is the most influential book in
human history.
</P>
<P>
   Let me share the following story that took place in the year
800.
</P>
<P>
   There was a kingdom called the Khuzaria, which was situated
between old Turkey and Russia. Buland, the king of the Khuzaria
people, was a very spiritual person. However, his country was a mix
of many religions and pagans.
</P>
<P>
   One night the king had a dream and he was told by an angel,
``Thy way of thinking is pleasing to God, but not Thy way of
acting.''
</P>
<P>
   The dream caused the king to study many religions. After
concluding there were three main religions he invited
representatives of each religion to his palace. To each he told the
following: ``You must pick a different religion than what you now
practice.'' This was made under the threat of death.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian said, ``the Jewish religion is for me, their Bible
is the old testament.'' The Moslem said, ``I do not believe that
the Christian religion is a way of life. I do, however, believe in
the Hebrew Bible. It is the mother of religions.'' The Jew answered
``I am ready for death. It is the Hebrew Bible that I want and
nothing else.''
</P>
<P>
   The king saw that the Hebrew Bible was respected by all
religions. Subsequently his entire nation embraced the Jewish
religion. The kingdom lasted two or three hundred years. Rabbi
Judah Halevi wrote a book in the 12th century describing the
episode, called ``The Book of the Khuzarai.''
</P>
<P>
   From this story we realize how respected the Hebrew Bible is by
all religions.
</P>
<P>
   In America's infancy we find the Puritans espousing the Hebrew
Bible. As early as 1650, the colony of New Haven used the Hebrew
Bible for its laws. By reviewing the writings of our early settlers
you will find that the leaders of the colonies studied and knew
Hebrew well.
</P>
<P>
   Our great Liberty Bell carries the quote from the Bible,
``Proclaim liberty throughout the land unto all inhabitants
thereof.'' Some knew a lot more about being Jewish in those days
than our present-day Jewish population. Our founding fathers wanted
religion to be part of our great republic.
</P>
<P>
   We all recognize that the Ten Commandments are the most
important instructions that God has given to the Jewish nation.
However, we must remember that there is no monopoly on the
commandments and their rewards. All nations are free to study and
observe the commandments.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe all religions should celebrate the holiday of Shavuoth,
the birthday of the Ten Commandments, God's present to the world.

   WASHINGTON, D.C. _ Exit 66 in Box Elder, S.D., is a long way
from Kosovo, but it's close enough for government work, which helps
explain why an emergency spending bill for the war in Yugoslavia
includes a new highway interchange for the town of 3,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers have larded the $15 billion spending package that is
sailing through Congress this week with similar narrow-interest
provisions. There's $100,000 for a new YMCA child care center in
Huntington Park, Calif. There's $1.5 million to buy water for a
parched lake in Arizona. There's $2 million for a study of a
proposed wood veneer plant in Ketchikan, Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which the House passed easily Tuesday and the Senate
is set to vote on Thursday, began as a straightforward effort to
pay for the air war and the damage left by a series of natural
disasters. But the must-pass legislation has become a handy vehicle
for lawmakers looking for a way to get pet projects on a fast
track.
</P>
<P>
   The spending package is expected to win final approval in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill has very little to do with busting Belgrade and a
great deal to do with bursting the budget,'' Rep. Lloyd Doggett,
D-Austin, said during House debate Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The bill earmarks $1.3 million to help prepare for a World Trade
Organization meeting in Seattle, gives the city of Colorado Springs
$1 million for a new summit house at Pike's Peak and clears the way
for an $8 million forestry research center at Auburn University in
Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the spending package say they demonstrated
remarkable restraint, given the temptations. About $12 billion of
the $15 billion bill is earmarked for defense. An additional $2.9
billion is dedicated to disaster relief. That left about $268
million for projects that fit neither category. It was that pot of
money that bankrolled most of the disputed items.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things that some people don't like. It depends
on where you're from and what you believe, I guess,'' said Sen. Ted
Stevens, R-Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it does, and if you're from Alaska, there's plenty to
like. As chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Stevens
made sure his state interests were addressed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the veneer plant, the spending bill includes $23
million to compensate Alaska fishers for losses they've suffered as
a result of fishing restrictions in Glacier Bay National Park.
Dungeness crab fishers are guaranteed ``fair market value'' from
the government for any crab pots and related gear they take out of
service.
</P>
<P>
   There's even a provision for reindeer that makes the animals
eligible for $70 million in livestock assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Santa in trouble?'' asked Rep. Greg Ganske, R-Iowa. ``Is
there some reindeer emergency that I am not aware of that requires
millions of dollars?''
</P>
<P>
   Some congressional add-ons are aimed at helping private
interests battle the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., added a provision overriding the
Interior Department's objections to the planned Crown Jewel Mine in
his state. Environmentalists are livid because the mine operators
plan to use a cyanide solution to extract gold from Buckhorn
Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, added language extending a
moratorium against a Clinton administration proposal to increase
royalties on oil and gas produced on federal land.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also weighed in on more mundane items, including
naming a new Post Office in Tuscumbia, Ala., after former Sen.
Howell Heflin.
</P>
<P>
   But it is money that counts the most back home.
</P>
<P>
   In Box Elder, Mayor Glenn Baldwin was thrilled by the prospect
of $3 million to help pay for a new interchange on Interstate 90.
City officials want to shut down Exit 66 because it is in the
flight path of the B-1 bombers at nearby Ellsworth Air Force Base.
The new exit would be about a mile down the highway.
</P>
<P>
   Rene Brizuela, the executive director of the YMCA in Huntington
Park, said the $100,000 grant for his facility would expand a
preschool day care program from 50 children to 100.
</P>
<P>
   ``The need is here. There's no question,'' Brizuela said. ``I
don't know what relationship it has to Kosovo, if there is any
relationship between Kosovo and child care.''
</P>
<P>
   And fishers at San Carlos Lake, near Globe, Ariz., can't wait to
get more water in a lake that is in danger of drying up this
summer. The money will be used to buy water from another lake.
</P>
<P>
   Proving that pork is in the eye of the beholder, a grateful
sports columnist publicly thanked the measure's chief sponsor, Rep.
Ed Pastor, D-Ariz., for slipping it into the spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congressmen are easy to criticize sometimes,'' Barry Burkhart
wrote in The Arizona Republic, ``but they're easy to love in this
situation.''

CLINTON'S EDUCATION PLAN FOCUSES ON DISTRICTS IMPROVING FAILING
SCHOOLS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Preparing for a partisan debate on the federal
government's role in public education, President Clinton outlined
Wednesday a sweeping agenda that would require districts to upgrade
failing schools or to allow students to transfer.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of Clinton's school plan would counter
Republican calls for the creation of vouchers that would allow
students, and their parents' tax dollars, to opt out for either
public or private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's education program also elevates the issue of safety,
and it would require more teaching of values and character _ a nod
to the nation's mood in the wake of school violence at Columbine
High School in Littleton, Colo., and elsewhere. The president will
meet with Columbine students and parents Thursday during a trip to
to the Denver-area suburb.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have supported higher standards, better teachers, new
technology, modern facilities, innovations like charter schools,
character education, school uniforms. But we know fundamentally
that if we are going to change the way our schools work, we must
change the way we invest federal aid in our schools,'' Clinton said
in a South Lawn ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government spends $15 billion annually, a small
percentage of public schools' funding and much of it dedicated to
helping improve achievement among low-income students.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's legislation would require school districts that
receive federal aid to improve their lowest performing schools.
Districts would be required to upgrade the failing schools within
two years. If no improvement is shown, the district would be
required to close the school and reopen it as a charter school or
allow students to transfer to other public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also would require school districts to phase out
the use of emergency certificates for its teachers, which allow
them to teach subjects in which they have not been certified by the
state. It would require states to adopt performance exams for all
new teachers to demonstrate subject knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Districts would be pushed to end social promotions, develop
consistent discipline policies and make early identification of
students who need academic assistance. It calls on Congress to
renew money for hiring new teachers to reduce class size nationwide
to 18 students.
</P>
<P>
   And, it calls for triple funding for after-school and summer
programs, more values-oriented education, and requires districts to
provide an annual report on drug and gun violence at each school.
The measure would require districts to develop security and safety
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know how to make meaningful change happen. The last thing
we need to be doing at this moment is to be listening to the sound
bite experts who are already promising another round of silver
bullet solutions and education quick fixes,'' said Education
Secretary Richard Riley, taking aim at the school-voucher plan
supported by many Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vouchers are a bad policy. It diverts money and attention away
from quality public schools. There's no question in my mind about
that,'' Riley said. ``It takes us off of the concentration of
making all schools better and having accountability. And, it gets
you off into some kind of magic way to improve education that I
think is absolutely wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Voucher supporters contend the freedom to transfer to public or
private schools would create additional competition and force
public schools to increase their quality.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. William Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the House Committee on
Education and the Work Force, said, ``The administration's
proposals trample on our nation's long and proven traditions of
local control of education; they would impose Washington solutions
to local problems. Republicans and others who value flexibility and
local initiatives have a better approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``In exchange for flexibility, we will expect results. We will
improve teacher training, not rely on political solutions like
funding for 100,000 teachers. We will send more dollars to the
classroom, where we know they will make a difference, not tie them
up in bureaucracy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Reed, the president's domestic policy adviser, predicted
there will be a ``great national debate'' this year on the role the
government should play in education.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some in Congress who believe that the national
government has no business investing more in education and no
business demanding accountability for results. We disagree. We
think this is a national problem, that we should say once and for
all that every kid ought to have a qualified teacher; no kid in
America should be trapped in a failing school; and that we should
fix our schools not one district at a time, not one state at a
time, but everywhere,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of
Teachers, said the organization supports Clinton's plan. She also
noted AFT has forged a coalition with the U.S. Catholic Conference
and other education groups to oppose efforts in Congress to use
some educations funds currently earmarked for disadvantage students
to create school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those funds must continue to go where they are most needed, to
disadvantaged children in our nation's cities, suburbs and rural
areas,'' she said.

<P>
   In Florida, a young dentist tracks stocks between patients,
sometimes even between an X-ray and a filling. In Washington state,
a freight-company manager logs on to a financial Web site for four
to six hours of his workday. A designer at a California
architectural firm gets so absorbed in the market that his
productivity falls 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The long bull market and cascading advances in technology have
combined to drive capitalism's main numbers game into the heart of
the American workplace, with millions of wage earners, managers and
entrepreneurs obsessing about Wall Street. Their obsession, in
fact, far eclipses the speculative 1920s, when elevator operators
and bootblacks were a chief source of what passed for information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago I would have never thought I'd be into doing
this,'' said the dentist, Norma Victores, 30, of Hialeah, Fla., who
follows the market on the Internet and has bought part of her
portfolio of 21 stocks and mutual funds online. ``I used to think
it was just for the big-timers.''
</P>
<P>
   While much of the early concern about workday Internet abuse
focused on pornography, the lure of the stock market has overtaken
it, some specialists said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where employees are really wasting their time,'' said
Jonathan Penn, an analyst at Giga Information Group, a firm that
advises companies on information technology. ``I'd definitely put
that first,'' he added, ahead of sports, personal e-mail and chat
rooms, with pornography _ its sites now typically blocked _ further
down the list.
</P>
<P>
   The flick-of-the-finger ease with which office workers and
others can research, monitor and trade stocks _ often able to
return instantly to their assigned tasks _ is of rising concern to
employers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Media Metrix, a New York company that meters
Internet use much the way Nielsen does television, 22.8 million
Americans used Web sites on company time in March. About 25 percent
of all corporate Internet traffic, much of it surreptitious, is
considered unrelated to work. Some 8.2 million people visited Yahoo
Finance, CBS Marketwatch, Schwab, E(STAR)Trade and other financial
sites at work, up from 6 million just three months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market ``is becoming a huge distraction,'' said Victor
Woodward, a vice president at Content Technologies, which develops
programs to help companies create and enforce policies for Internet
usage. He said corporate demand for help in curbing stock-related
Web use had quadrupled in the past year as proprietors of gateways
add monitoring and other financial features as ``a way to draw in
eyeballs,'' which bring advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Online trades account for as much as 30 percent of all buying
and selling by individual investors, surveys show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine that this is not a problem in the workplace,''
acknowledged Jill Munden, who oversees Silicon Investor, the
biggest financial discussion forum. She said that 50 percent of
site visits, which average 20 minutes each, come during regular
working hours and that ``you have to believe most people don't
divulge trades and research to their boss or co-workers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web site for Charles Schwab , the broker accounting for more
than a quarter of Internet transactions, now averages 33 million
visits a day, up from 24 million in the fourth-quarter of 1998,
according to Daniel Hubbard, a spokesman. And actual transactions,
which take only a couple of minutes, are outnumbered 26 to 1 by
typically longer sessions for researching companies or mutual funds
or to review portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab's busiest periods, Hubbard found, coincide with the
opening and closing hours of the New York Stock Exchange _ from
9:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m and 3:30 p.m. to 4 p.m.. For many West Coast
investors, though, these might well not be work hours.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Dean Hatfield, a designer, for whom raking in
fast-stock-market money of between $5,000 and $15,000 a month for
much of last year began to threaten his day job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of billing, say, 37 hours during the week, as I should
have, I was billing perhaps 28,'' said Hatfield, who works at KRJ
Design in Burlingame, Calif. ``It became an issue because the
revenue just wasn't coming in.'' Hatfield's superiors took away his
Internet access, so now if he wants to go online he must walk to
another terminal, his activities easily visible. He likens it to
``getting your hands caught in the cookie jar.'' Now, he says, ``I
do it on the phone or from home _ but it's not day-trading
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   At American Fast Freight, a Kent, Wash., company that bundles
shipments into bigger units and then arranges for overseas
transport, the official in charge of computers, Jeff LePage, is
still struggling to find a way to ``put the kibosh'' on a
middle-aged employee who is routinely logged onto a financial site
for most of the working day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't really focused on this until it became chronic,''
said LePage, who now notices a gradual decline in the unit's
performance that he blames on the employee, a peer he is reluctant
to confront.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's John Alexandrou, a 43-year-old salesman in Foster
City, Calif., who said that for the past three years he has spent
30 minutes to an hour of working time a day on the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adrenalin of trading options, that's got me completely
hooked,'' Alexandrou said, adding that the fraternity of on-the-job
market devotees is very large indeed, especially in Silicon Valley.
``You're not going to find very many people in this Valley who are
not distracted by the stock market,'' he said. He insisted,
however, that while he has suffered big losses on occasion, he
never fails to make his business quotas.
</P>
<P>
   The heaviest concentration of Internet stock activity does
indeed seem to be on the West Coast, especially in the high-tech
community, where much of employees' pay is in stock options and it
is common for even those of low rank to have an equity stake.

 UNDATED: equity stake.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of course, while the Internet makes a lot of information
available to small investors that was once accessible only to
professionals, that does not mean all those investors necessarily
pay less attention to their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Brown, vice president of MSI Consulting, a Seattle-based
management and marketing adviser to high-tech companies, says he
often spends less time tending to his portfolio in the mid-six
figures than when he used to phone orders to a broker, a process he
said can mean ``you've chewed up an hour of your day.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor has the government been able to discern much economic effect
from the presumed productivity loss caused by a distracted work
force. Growth in output per hour accelerated last year, and Michael
Harper, acting associate commissioner for Productivity and
Technology at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, guessed that the time
wasted by workers on the stock market was not unlike water-cooler
discussion of football or movies, and may even be a partial
substitute for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know whether they would be working _ or doing
something else'' if interest in the stock market should wane,
Harper said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the market is seen as an increasingly serious time-eater
by many employers, who while having great technical ability to
monitor Internet activity, have only recently begun to do so in
earnest. A survey by the Society for Human Resource Management
found 76 percent of members not bothering as recently as 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, employees seem to have little trouble avoiding
detection from casual observation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could hide the day-trading quite easily,'' said Hatfield,
the California designer, a 36-year-old who for a time was making
more money trading than in salary. ``One second I was in
E(STAR)Trade,'' he said, referring to a popular electronic broker.
``And the next second I was doing design in AutoCad,'' a tool of
his trade.

 &HT;    INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION SURVIVES HOUSE TEST
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (a) general news categories

 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Despite its inflating cost and significant delays,
the international space station survived attempts in the House
Wednesday to scrap it.
</P>
<P>
   The NASA project avoided being terminated by a vote of 337 to
92. The House also rejected amendments to limit money for the
project and to exclude Russia from the station's international
partnership. The action came as the House considered a bill
authorizing NASA's future activities. A final vote is expected
today (THURSDAY).
</P>
<P>
   (NOTE: Next graph for Palm Beach Post; trim for other papers)
</P>
<P>
   Reps. E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Ft. Lauderdale; Alcee Hastings,
D-Miramar; Mark Foley, R-West Palm Beach,; and Robert Wexler,
D-Boca Raton, voted with the majority each time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think its a good deal for science,'' said Rep. Tim
Roemer, D-Ind., a House Science Committee member who moved to
eliminate the station. ``This project just doesn't live up to
NASA's past accomplishments.''
</P>
<P>
   Proposed in 1984 by Ronald Reagan, the station originally was
projected to cost $8 billion to launch and maintain, while current
costs are estimated at $100 billion. The United States has invested
$20 billion in the project and still has $80 billion to go, said
Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., a co-sponsor of Roemer's amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This project is becoming ridiculous in its costs and time
overruns,'' Sanford said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., chairman of the House
Science Committee, said the space station is vital in developing
technologies and medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Roemer said the partnership with Russia cost the United States
more time and money in constructing the station. The administration
encouraged a partnership with Russia to save taxpayers $2 billion,
but instead it has cost the United States $4 billion, Roemer said.
He blamed the increased cost on numerous delays and Russia's
financial problems.

UNCERTAIN OF ITS PATH, UNITED STATES PROVIDES NO DIRECTION TO
ALLIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS _ As NATO wrestles with whether to dispatch combat
troops to Kosovo, there is no longer a unified NATO strategy about
how to win the war. And without Washington providing a clear
direction, Britain, Germany and Italy have begun to publicly
promote separate and conflicting plans.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been unable to quiet the unruly chorus
because it has not made up its own mind about how to bring the war
to a successful close. As Washington's allies lock horns over the
risks and advantages of a land campaign, President Clinton has said
only that he is not excluding the option.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have is a committee that lacks a chairman,'' said Ivo
Daalder, the former director of European Affairs at the National
Security Council. ``There is a lack of direction because no one is
leading the way.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's confusion is, no doubt, welcome news for President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia. From the start, his strategy has
been to ride out the air war, encourage divisions within the
Western alliance and try to negotiate a Kosovo settlement on his
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, events at NATO headquarters this week provided ample
evidence of dissension within the ranks. British Foreign Minister
Robin Cook started off the week by reminding the alliance that time
was running out for NATO's plan to return ethnic Albanian refugees
to Kosovo before the winter. He urged NATO to quicken the pace by
considering a land attack after Serb troops were weakened by
several more months of air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The British plan, however, was greeted today with undisguised
contempt by German Chancellor Gerhard Schroder.
</P>
<P>
   Under political pressure from pacifists in his coalition
government, Schroder told a closed-door meeting of NATO ambassadors
that Germany wanted the air war to continue but would not back a
NATO ground attack. That was a significant statement since there
cannot be an allied land campaign without the approval of all 19
NATO members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not participate in this specifically British debate on
war theories,'' Schroder later said in caustic remarks to the
press. ``I am against any change in NATO strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was just the German view. The Italians have their own
political problems: leftists in Italy's government's coalition have
complained about allied air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with the criticism at home, Italy has fashioned its own,
somewhat convoluted plan. It has urged NATO to impose a 48-hour
bombing pause after the United Nations Security Council agrees to a
resolution outlining the principles of a peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   If Belgrade still balked, Italy says, NATO could restart its air
strikes and mount a land campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each country has to deal with its own domestic
constituencies,'' a senior Western diplomat said. ``Like everything
in NATO, this will depend on where the United States comes down.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressing question is whether air strikes alone will enable
NATO to attain its objectives. And if it does not, should the
alliance compromise with President Milosevic or raise the stakes by
sending in ground troops?
</P>
<P>
   Washington has yet to declare its hand, virtually inviting a
continuation of the noisy debate. Top Clinton administration

 &HT;    INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION SURVIVES HOUSE TEST

<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Despite its inflating cost and significant delays,
the international space station survived attempts in the House
Wednesday to scrap it.
</P>
<P>
   The NASA project avoided being terminated by a vote of 337 to
92. The House also rejected amendments to limit money for the
project and to exclude Russia from the station's international
partnership. The action came as the House considered a bill
authorizing NASA's future activities. A final vote is expected
today (THURSDAY).
</P>
<P>
   (NOTE: Next graph for Palm Beach Post; trim for other papers)
</P>
<P>
   Reps. E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Ft. Lauderdale; Alcee Hastings,
D-Miramar; Mark Foley, R-West Palm Beach,; and Robert Wexler,
D-Boca Raton, voted with the majority each time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think its a good deal for science,'' said Rep. Tim
Roemer, D-Ind., a House Science Committee member who moved to
eliminate the station. ``This project just doesn't live up to
NASA's past accomplishments.''
</P>
<P>
   Proposed in 1984 by Ronald Reagan, the station originally was
projected to cost $8 billion to launch and maintain, while current
costs are estimated at $100 billion. The United States has invested
$20 billion in the project and still has $80 billion to go, said
Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., a co-sponsor of Roemer's amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This project is becoming ridiculous in its costs and time
overruns,'' Sanford said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., chairman of the House
Science Committee, said the space station is vital in developing
technologies and medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Roemer said the partnership with Russia cost the United States
more time and money in constructing the station. The administration
encouraged a partnership with Russia to save taxpayers $2 billion,
but instead it has cost the United States $4 billion, Roemer said.
He blamed the increased cost on numerous delays and Russia's
financial problems.

STRIKE THREATENED BY TEAMSTERS WHO TRUCK NEW AUTOS TO DEALERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The Teamsters' union is threatening a strike by
drivers against the trucking companies that carry new cars to
dealerships. Such a move would likely limit the selection of
vehicles available to consumers but would not affect the economy as
much as a strike at an auto factory.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers voted overwhelmingly earlier this week to authorize
their leaders to call a strike if a new national contract with the
trucking companies cannot be negotiated before the current
four-year contract expires May 31.
</P>
<P>
   This contract was concluded only after a 32-day strike in 1995
against the leading car-carrier company at the time, Ryder System
Inc. in Miami, and many in the auto industry are concerned that
another strike may be likely.
</P>
<P>
   With auto sales running at the fastest pace ever through the
first four months of this year, a strike could quickly disrupt
supplies to dealerships. ``Everyone would have a problem,'' said
Ford Motor Co. chief executive Jacques Nasser earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem would not be as serious as last summer's 54-day
strike by General Motors auto parts workers in Flint, Mich. That
strike forced GM to close virtually all of its North American
assembly plants.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers were able to keep their factories operating during
the 1995 strike, shipping new cars and light trucks by rail
whenever possible and storing other finished vehicles in empty
lots. GM, the automaker most reliant on Ryder, continued shipping
cars by rail to its 50 regional distribution centers and invited
dealers to send employees to drive the new cars from the centers to
the dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   State laws allow vehicles to be sold as new even if dealers and
their employees have had to drive them to their point of sale.
Since the last strike, Ryder has sold its car-transport business to
Allied Holdings Inc., based in Decatur, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A strike could be much more significant for the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters and its new president, James P. Hoffa,
than for the auto industry. While the Teamsters now represent
workers in many industries, the union has its roots in the trucking
industry, where much of the organizing was done by Hoffa's father,
James R. Hoffa. Negotiations with the car-transport companies will
offer Hoffa his first chance to show whether he can negotiate
bigger gains for drivers than his predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   If negotiators for the Teamsters and trucking companies are
unable to reach a deal by May 31, the truckers would not
necessarily walk off the job immediately. Though the Teamsters have
threatened an immediate walkout, the union made a similar threat in
1995 but waited until September.
</P>
<P>
   Some auto assembly plants close for weeks at a time in June and
July to install new equipment for the building of the next model
year's vehicles. The Teamsters would be able to put more pressure
on the transport companies for a settlement if the union waits
until factories resume weekly production of hundreds of thousands
of new cars.
</P>
<P>
   If the drivers struck, dealerships would most likely run out of
popular models that are in short supply. Inventories are now lowest
for full-sized sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks and for
Japanese-brand minivans like Honda Motor Co.'s Odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   The Flint strike last summer led to layoffs of nearly 200,000
workers at GM and thousands of employees at its suppliers,
significantly slowing economic growth in the United States in the
second and third quarters. GM has still not fully recovered from
that strike.

LARGE-CAP CONCENTRATION MAY BE A LITTLE HEAVY  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Subs for column sent Friday for Sunday, May 16 release.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am a 52-year-old woman who hopes to retire at about age 65.
I have the following IRA mutual fund accounts: $9,406 in Franklin's
Mutual Beacon Z, $4,086 in Fidelity Puritan, $10,431 in Fidelity
Growth and Income, and $35,489 in IDS New Dimensions. Through my
present employer I have $4,000 in a 457 deferred compensation
program, with 60 percent of it in Janus Twenty and 20 percent each
in Janus Worldwide and Fidelity Growth and Income. I add $50 a week
to this account. I also have $10,593 in a 401(k) program with a
previous employer, and I would like to reallocate this money. How
should I reallocate these holdings? I feel I should probably have
some money in a bond fund and some in a small-cap fund. I have
looked at Baron Small Cap fund, but I really hate to have holdings
with so many companies. What do you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   N.M., Nashua, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   A. I think both categories you're suggesting make sense,
although you may be a few years early in establishing a heavier
bond position (remember that about a third of the Puritan portfolio
is on the fixed-income side). If you want to continue with the fund
families you're now using, I suggest you take a look at Janus
Venture fund as a small-cap holding, and at Fidelity Mortgage
Securities fund for your first all-bond holding. Other than that,
the only imbalance I see is the concentration in large-cap domestic
holdings, represented by the stock side of the Puritan, and all of
Fidelity Growth and Income, IDS New Dimensions, and all of Janus
Twenty. My suggestion for a final diversification would be to move
half of the money that's in the Fidelity Growth and Income IRA into
Fidelity Select Health Care. Other than that, it seems to me you're
doing fine.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 33 years old, married, and have a 4-year-old daughter. I
currently earn approximately $42,000 a year as a federal employee,
and 10 years from now can retire at half of my base salary for the
rest of my life. All of my savings are in mutual funds, allocated
as follows: $50,000 in Vanguard Windsor II, $32,000 in Janus fund,
$25,000 in Fidelity Magellan, $20,000 in an IRA invested in T. Rowe
Price International Stock, $12,000 in Janus Twenty, and $2,500 in a
money market account. In addition, I invested $3,000 in American
Century Twentieth Century's Giftrust fund for my daughter. I have
been adding $166 a month to the T. Rowe Price IRA account, and I
also add $100 a month to the Janus fund account. My goals are to
save for my daughter's education and to retire comfortably at age
65 (after working another job after retiring from the military). I
am considering starting a Roth IRA account for my wife in Janus
Worldwide fund and investing $100 a month in Vanguard's Index 500.
With the latter investment, the account would be in my name, but
would be earmarked for my daughter's education. I would then stop
the monthly contribution to Janus fund. Do you think I have too
many funds? Am I overdiversified? The Giftrust account has
performed very poorly over the last two years, but the contract
requires that I keep if for at least 10 years. Do I have any
options here? I am also hearing that this was not a wise investment
because parents are expected to contribute higher percentages of
their assets to educational expenses than children. Is this
basically true? My hope with the Vanguard Index 500 idea is to keep
both expenses and taxes down. Finally, is it prudent for both my
wife and I to have IRAs invested in the international sector?
</P>
<P>
   T.P., Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Starting with the last question, I see no problem right away,
but if you continued putting all your retirement savings in world
or international funds, you would soon enough find that sector
represented too much of the retirement savings. Right now, your
position in T. Rowe Price represents 15.5 percent of your portfolio
(excluding the Giftrust account). It wouldn't take many years of
contributions to the two IRA accounts before they get beyond 20
percent, which is where I would place the limit.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of going with Janus Worldwide, why not look to funds
that would take a different path to getting you better diversified.
The biggest problem I see is that more than 80 percent of the
portfolio is in domestic large-cap stocks. So I suggest you divide
your wife's IRA money between Janus Enterprise, a mid-cap growth
fund, and Janus Venture, a small-cap fund. Both are rated three
stars, or average, by Morningstar, but when you look at the ratings
in those fund sectors, you'll discover that three stars are
excellent in these two sectors, which have been taking their lumps
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The story on Giftrust is even worse than you fear. According to
Morningstar Mutual Funds, the contract for this fund's owners
requires that the investment be held for 10 years or until the
owner reaches the age of majority -- whichever comes later.
</P>
<P>
   So there's nothing you can do but stick with it -- and, of
course, refrain from making further contributions to the account.
You are correct that it's best to keep your daughter's college
money in your name, and index funds such as Vanguard Index 500 tend
to be relatively tax-efficient.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I hold investments worth $461,940. We want to
retire five years from now when she will be 56 and I will be 55. Do
we have enough invested to retire and draw approximately $40,000
annual income from our savings?
</P>
<P>
   M.S., Desert Hot Springs, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, I think you will have enough saved to attain your goal,
but there's some question whether you will have enough to protect
yourselves from the likely ravages of inflation in the later years
of your retirement. Here's the math: If you continue your $1,000
monthly contributions to the accounts and achieve 8 percent
portfolio growth during the next five years, the pool would be
$751,796 at retirement time. Presuming you could achieve a 6.5
percent average yield from a fixed-income portfolio, you would need
about $615,000 thus invested to support $3,333 monthly withdrawals
without erosion of capital. That would leave you with $136,796
which you could leave in growth-oriented investments to deal with
later inflation.

 &HT;    HI-TECH GAINS KEEP U.S. MILITARY COMMANDERS IN TOUCH WORLDWIDE
 &HT;    EDS: This story is also suitable for technology pages.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TASK FORCE HAWK, Albania _ During World War II, Gen. Dwight
Eisenhower sometimes waited for carrier pigeons to bring battle
dispatches from the front lines.
</P>
<P>
   During the Gulf War, Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf often got news from
the battle faster on CNN than from his own military communications.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Lt. Gen. John Hendrix, commander of Task Force Hawk
troops in Albania, has tools of military communication that his
predecessors could scarcely dream of.
</P>
<P>
   And as he still prepares for a possible strike into Kosovo with
Apache tank-killing helicopters, the top U.S. commander is not the
only beneficiary of the military's great internet leap forward.
</P>
<P>
   Now even the 25-year-old captains working under Hendrix can call
up a classified bulletin board on their laptops that gives them
immediate access to operational orders and intelligence. Or they
can whip off a quick e-mail to their spouses or their bill
collectors, using an unclassified military internet system called
NIPRNET.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average captain here has more internet power in his or her
hands than a general did in the desert in Desert Storm,'' said Army
Maj. Doug Wolfe, 35, of Catasauqua, Pa., who is deputy
communications officer of Task Force Hawk.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the 24 Apache gunships and an assortment of artillery
rocket launchers, perhaps the most potent weapon the Army has
airlifted into Albania are 200 laptop computers and a plethora of
associated communications gear.
</P>
<P>
   For every 25 of Hendrix's soldiers, there is one
government-supplied laptop. All 200 have Ethernet cards or similar
devices so that they can be hooked in together in a military-wide
Local Area Network.
</P>
<P>
   Many, if not most, of the Army's current laptops have been
bought off-the-shelf from companies like Motorola, IBM, RCA,
Micron, Gateway, and Dell. The same is true of other communications
gear being used here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Army units in the field have been about eight to ten years
behind the civilian industry,'' said Lt. Col. Karla Torrez, 41, of
Cocoa Beach, Fla., the commander of the 32nd Signal Battalion from
Darmstadt, Germany. ``We are always evolving, just as they are.''
</P>
<P>
   In purchasing laptops for troops in the field, the Army
deliberately does not require any particular brand name. Instead,
it has been taking bids for standard laptops with some type of a
Pentium chip, plus at least 32 megabytes of memory. Some of these
``tactical'' laptops use Windows NT 4.0 as their operating system
while others use Windows 95, Windows 98, UNIX or
</P>
<P>
   Linux.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I think there is also one Apple out here,'' said
Wolfe.
</P>
<P>
   When Hendrix first wakes up each morning inside his
camouflage-netted headquarters, he can immediately sit in front of
his own dedicated computer and fire off an e-mail to anyone in the
world. He can choose from two e-mail systems installed in his
laptop _ one for ``secure'' messages and one for ``unsecure.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Hendrix walks over to his command office, he has access to
another dedicated computer, this one also plugged into both secure
and unsecure internet networks.
</P>
<P>
   If Hendrix wants to dispatch a secret military message, he could
log onto the military's worldwide SIPRNET (Secure Internet Protocol
Network) system.
</P>
<P>
   This would allow him to send even highly secret information
almost instantly on a network designed to foil enemy eavesdroppers.
Using SIPRNET, he also can check for any overnight secret traffic
from his superiors in Italy, Brussels and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A SIPRNET message is first encrypted, using a super-secret
``key'' that has been certified to be immune to enemy eavesdroppers
by the U.S. National Security Agency. Then it is bounced from
Albania to somewhere outside the Balkans via a military satellite
to a downlink called the STEP site. From there, the message is
relayed to the rest of the SIPRNET, the
</P>
<P>
   military's secure turf within the internet.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrix has a good many options if he wants a heart-to-heart
with his superiors thousands of miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can pick up a secure telephone and call them,'' said Wolfe.
``He can send them an e-mail note on secure e-mail. He can talk to
them securely via VTC (video teleconferencing). So he has a lot of
communications tools available to him that were not available to
Gen. Schwarzkopf back in Desert Storm.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his subordinates, Hendrix is known to be a devotee of
management through secure video teleconferencing.
</P>
<P>
   After morning chow, Hendrix normally calls a transcontinental
staff meeting via secure VTC (video teleconferencing.) Hendrix sits
in front of a VTC terminal _ a laptop equipped with a microphone
and a small camera trained on his face.
</P>
<P>
   Back at his rear headquarters in Germany and other selected
points around the world, there are similar VTC terminals for
various generals, admirals and perhaps some civilians who have been
granted the right to participate in daily Task Force Hawk planning
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, there is often a second and a third video
teleconference. At least one of these regular meetings-by-video is
a top secret discussion run by Hendrix's G-2 (intelligence) section
that presumably includes the latest satellite imagery and other
data on what is happening in Yugoslavia and perhaps elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   This intelligence video teleconference takes place on an even
more secure military communications network that is known here by
its acronym, JWICCS.
</P>
<P>
   Though military communications have improved dramatically in the
last decade, everything isn't perfect here.
</P>
<P>
   The big challenge is trying to overcome the mountains of
Albania, which sometimes make it difficult for commanders to reach
the low-flying Apaches and their support helicopters as they scoot
through the valleys leading toward Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mountain terrain has caused problems here that we've
always talked about when we teach doctrine to Army units,'' said
Col. Torrez of the 32nd Signal Battalion. ``But to experience it,
you really recognize the challenge that a lot of our systems cannot
get over the mountains. And satellites become more of a requirement
than a luxury.''
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the problem is that from World War II to the Gulf
War, the Army has run its battles mostly with walkie-talkies and
other forms of ``line of sight'' communications. In the mountains,
they don't work as well as they do in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   During Operation Desert Storm against Iraqi forces, one of the
most dependable battlefield radios was called ``Fox Mike'' _ the
military way of referring to a certain portion of the FM radio
band.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those (military radios using FM) have been improved since
Desert Storm,'' said Wolfe. ``There are not only improvements in
security, but also improvements in the radios. Back in Desert
Storm, most units were using old-model Fox Mike (radios). Now they
are using something called SINCGARS (Single Channel Ground Airborne
Radio System). It's a very good system.''
</P>
<P>
   Good. But not ideal for the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   To overcome the limitations of ``line-of-sight'' radios, the
Army also relies on a network of military satellites, some of them
called TACSATs. And then there is the high-flying
command-and-control plane called the ABCCC, which can fly high over
Albania with a ranking Army general and a staff of communications
experts aboard to help manage an Apache attack.
</P>
<P>
   It's taken some on-the-spot ingenuity, but the Army is figuring
ways to communicate on the ground despite the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though you need satellites to get over the mountains, you
can extend the range from your systems by taking the satellite into
a line-of-site system and breaking it off into potentially two
locations via line-of-site,'' said Torrez. ``So we are mixing the
systems.''
</P>
<P>
   As adept at communicating as the Army is today, the experts on
the scene from the Signal Corps are not claiming they can do
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are limits,'' said Torrez. ``The satellites are one. You
only have so much bandwidth available. And bandwidth is a common
term in the Signal Corps that is our constraint these days. The
more bandwidth, the bigger the communications pipe. The bigger the
pipe, the more you can pump through.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the technological advances of the last decade that permitted
the army to multiply its ``connectivity,'' the most important was
the widespread adoption of digital technology for satellite
communications, as well as a data-sending method called ``packet
switching.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have transferred from analog technology _ analog systems _
to digital systems and packet switching,'' said Torrez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Packet-switching assigns time slots to the transfer of data
and does it continuously,'' said Torrez. ``The basic analog
telephone circuitry was: 'I gave you 16 channels on a group. Once
you dialed and seized a channel, no one else could have it, whether
you used it or not.'
</P>
<P>
   ``With packet-switching and digital technology, we can give a
group of computers a channel to do packet-switching on, and they
will get a lot more information transferred.''

STEPASHIN IS EASILY CONFIRMED AS RUSSIA'S PRIME MINISTER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The new prime minister, Sergei V. Stepashin, won an
easy confirmation vote Wednesday in the lower house of Parliament,
bringing the brief political crisis to an eerily peaceful end.
</P>
<P>
   It was just a week ago that President Boris N. Yeltsin shuffled
the political deck and confounded his Communist opposition by
dismissing Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov on the eve of an
impeachment debate.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment vote fizzled on Saturday, and Wednesday, even
Communist legislators voted for Stepashin, a 47-year-old Yeltsin
loyalist whose last job was head of the national police force.
</P>
<P>
   The final vote for Stepashin was 301 to 55, a comfortable
majority in the 450-seat house.
</P>
<P>
   Barring more sudden changes, Stepashin, a cautious survivor of
Kremlin wars and intrigues, is in a strong position to carry a
lame-duck government through the parliamentary elections in
December and, maybe, even the presidential elections in June 2000.
</P>
<P>
   After the anticlimactic vote, even Stepashin conceded that he
had expected more resistance. ``I was preparing hard, I was nervous
and I expected a lot of vicious and complex questions,'' he told
Parliament. ``There were practically none today.''
</P>
<P>
   Western analysts were also relieved, and some said they were
reassured by Stepashin's early statements on economic policy and
rumored Cabinet appointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been pleasantly surprised,'' said Margot Jacobs, an
analyst for United Financial Group, an investment group here.
</P>
<P>
   By approving Stepashin on a first vote, the lower house, the
Duma, sidestepped an open threat of early dissolution that under
the Constitution becomes mandatory when a president's prime
minister-designate is rejected three times.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the impeachment vote on Saturday, many members of
Parliament had been looking for a way out of a confrontation with
the Kremlin that would have cost them the perquisites and
privileges of office just before an election. Many were also wary
of further provoking a president whose behavior is notoriously
erratic and whose constitutional powers remain considerable.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Yeltsin's own gamble has paid off, for now. He
has succeeded in ridding himself of Primakov, a prime minister who
in recent months had irritated the Kremlin with his growing
independence and increasingly close ties to the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Yeltsin chided Primakov for a do-nothing economic
policy. Privately, his aides accused the prime minister of
Communist sympathies that could prove dangerous if left unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   With the approval of Stepashin, Yeltsin has returned to a status
that existed before Primakov, with a government wholly dependent on
the Kremlin and a Parliament dominated by his opposition. If the
crisis made any real dent in the situation, it was to reveal the
depth and the breadth of Yeltsin's political isolation, as
moderates, nationalists and Communists took turns blaming him for
the economic misery and military weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Although his popularity is at an all-time low, his powers are
not to be toyed with, as parliament was reminded again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that with the country half in ruins we need some
sort of stability,'' Vladimir Ryzhkov, leader of the Our Home Is
Russia faction in Parliament, said. ``Under our Constitution, it is
the president who decides whom to appoint as prime minister. There
is no point in resisting.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin, a veteran of the security services who played a
crucial role in the disastrous war in Chechnya, offered himself as
a conciliatory candidate who would continue Primakov's politics of
consensus while pursuing a more aggressive approach to the economic
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``A simple continuity of the course of political and economic
stabilization is no longer enough,'' Stepashin said. ``Changes have
ripened in the very tactics of pursuing this course. There is no
more place for halfhearted measures and compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has promised to keep the ``backbone'' of the
Primakov Cabinet, important personnel changes are in the offing.
Two prominent Communist ministers, whose jobs Primakov went out of
his way to protect, are on their way out.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin is widely expected to appoint Aleksandr Zhukov, 43,
chairman of the Duma budget committee and a veteran of the Finance
Ministry, as his economics czar.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Stepashin said that he would not only champion a
package of unpopular fiscal legislation sought by the International
Monetary Fund, but that he would also defend it with a confidence
vote in his own government.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Russia stepped up a long promised campaign to tidy up
the banking mess left by the financial collapse in August. The
Central Bank revoked the licenses of 12 banks, with others
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not restore health to the banking sector, but it will
drag away the carcasses,'' said Ms. Jacobs of United Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts said that the license should have been revoked
months ago, before the owners had transferred their assets and hid
them in new companies, but that any move, however symbolic at this
point, was better than none.
</P>
<P>
   The pending appointment of Zhukov as overall manager of economic
policy was also welcomed by Western analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In appointing Zhukov, he will be giving the job to someone who
understands the budget and pragmatic budget politics, not like the
old team, which had to spend six months getting educated,'' said
Peter Boone, chief analyst for Brunswick Warburg, an investment
group.

YELTSIN PRIME MINISTER PICK EASILY APPROVED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Just days after narrowly surviving an impeachment vote,
President Boris N. Yeltsin consummated his victory over parliament
Wednesday as his choice for prime minister sailed through an
unusually easy confirmation vote.
</P>
<P>
   One Kremlin aide called it an ``indisputable victory'' for
Yeltsin after the State Duma, the normally hostile lower house of
parliament, voted 301-55 to approve Sergei Stepashin, the former
head of police and internal security forces, as Russia's third
premier in the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   But Duma leaders made it clear the vote was not a sign of
confidence that Stepashin, 47, who has no background in economic
administration, had the answers to the country's many economic
woes. The lawmakers were voting to prevent a showdown with Yeltsin
that some predicted could lead to bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators said they decided not to avoid further confrontation
with the volatile Russian president after failing to muster the 300
votes needed to begin impeachment proceedings against Yeltsin on
Saturday. And anyway, lawmakers said, Stepashin was not the worst
man for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he fires the right people and hires the right people and
his government lasts for more than three weeks, well, yes, he might
accomplish something,'' lawmaker Grigory Yavlinsky said of
Stepashin, in faint praise that echoed throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin shook off the less-than-enthusiastic reception and
thanked lawmakers for their support, which he said meant political
forces were ready put aside their disagreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are united by concern for our homeland for our people so
that our country may at last become normal, civilized, wealthy,
prosperous and great,'' Stepashin said after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the vote approving Stepashin ended, for now, a
government crisis that began last week when Yeltsin abruptly fired
the government of former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who was
popular both in polls and in the Duma. Yeltsin, despite his
frequent illnesses and 2 percent approval rating, has suddenly
reemerged as Russia's most powerful political figure _ again.
</P>
<P>
   It must be said that the aging, ailing Russian president is
probably the world leader in being written off and making
improbable political comebacks. But in his many catfights with the
Duma, the president has prevailed only in part because he is a
master of political brinksmanship, especially in comparison with
his main opponents in Russia. It is the constitution Yeltsin
imposed on Russia in 1993, first by dissolving parliament with
tanks and later by pushing through a highly suspicious referendum,
that gives the president the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   If the Duma had failed to approve Stepashin, the constitution
gave Yeltsin the right to keep naming him, or appoint someone more
radical. After the third vote, Yeltsin would have been able to
dismiss the Duma and set new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Had Yeltsin been impeached, he could not have dismissed the
Duma. But only one impeachment charge _ illegally waging war in
Chechnya _ came anywhere near success. Only a few deputies
Wednesday pondered the irony that the Duma nearly impeached Yeltsin
over Chechnya, but then approved Stepashin, who as head of Russian
counterintelligence played a key role in the early mishaps of the
war, which killed an estimated 80,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Duma grumbled that Stepashin's government will
probably be as short-lived as those of his predecessors, Primakov,
Sergei Kiriyenko and Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, who led the failed
impeachment drive, said Stepashin's desire to serve was ``almost
even admirable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the new government has no guarantees that it will be able
to accomplish anything while the main destroyer is sitting in the
Kremlin,'' Zyuganov said during a remarkably brisk debate over
Stepashin's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov also expressed concern that Stepashin, loyal to Yeltsin
might choose ministers from the ``oligarchs,'' a group of financial
insiders personified by Yeltsin family friend Boris Berezovsky; and
the ``young reformers,'' a group led by former economic guru
Anatoly Chubais. Most Russians blame those two groups for the
country's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   However, only one lawmaker spoke out against Stepashin. ``Those
who vote for Stepashin will be voting to prolong the genocide
against our people!'' cried legislator Magarita Chistokhodova.
</P>
<P>
   But most Duma members figured that voting against Stepashin
would be voting to prolong the government crisis, and that the
lower house had nothing to gain from the confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Ryzhkov, head of bloc that usually supports Yeltsin,
agreed. He compared Russia today to the last days of the Russian
empire, when an autocratic but unpopular czar drove the country to
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``In such a situation, who will give a red cent that (Stepashin)
will work for three more months,'' Ryzhkov said. ``We believe that
with the country half in ruins we need some sort of stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin said it would take him about a week to form a
government and immediately embarked on a two-hour meeting with
Yeltsin in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin was at work a day after Spanish officials caused a scare
Tuesday by saying the president had come down with acute bronchitis
_ something the Kremlin denied. The president made no public
statements, but made a point of appearing on national television
with Vladimir Putin, the head of state security, just to let
everyone know who was in control.
</P>
<P>
   In his address to the chamber, Stepashin pledged to deal harshly
with criminals and corruption, repeating promises that he has made
as interior minister. But he sought to play down speculation that
his nomination was a prelude to a crackdown on opposition parties,
rumors that have drawn comparsions to former Chilean dictator
Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not General Pinochet,'' he told the chamber. ``My name is
Stepashin.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin promised not to make major changes to the policies
pursued by Primakov, who was widely credited with calming the
political and economic crises that followed the collapse of
Russia's financial system last August.
</P>
<P>
   But Stepashin also said Russians expected ``concrete and
positive results from the government'' and he would provide them.

HUNGARY'S COMMITMENT TO NATO SHOWING STRAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST _ It was not the most auspicious timing in history:
Just weeks after Hungary joined NATO, it became a member of an
alliance waging a nasty war, right under Hungary's southern border.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, Hungary has never been known for its well-timed
choices. In World War I, Hungary sided with the Germans, and
forfeited substantial territory when it lost. In World War II,
Hungary sided with the Nazis, and in the postwar negotiations ended
up under the thumb of the Soviet Union for 45 years.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to be on the winning, prosperous side for a change,
Hungary lobbied hard to get into NATO. And now, many Hungarians are
wondering just what they've gotten themselves into _ again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we are again, in the wrong place, at the wrong time.
Throughout history, we have always joined the wrong organization at
the wrong time,'' lamented Agi Veres, 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy Hungary has joined NATO, since it's the first step
to joining Western Europe in general,'' said Veres, a management
consultant. But the timing was off, she said. ``The war is too
close and it could turn into something messy,'' Veres said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's most prominent members are bickering over the extent and
direction of the military campaign against Yugoslavia. The British
are advocating ground troops; the Americans are reluctant to send
them, and both Germany and Italy have made noises about
interrupting the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   As a NATO newcomer, Hungary has officially been extremely
cooperative. The government has agreed to allow the use of
Hungarian air space; it is accepting the arrival of 24 F-18 fighter
jets this weekend; and it is allowing the use of its southern base
in Taszar.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've really stepped up to the plate,'' said a Western
diplomat. ``They've done everything we've asked, and have welcomed
us with open arms.''
</P>
<P>
   But the cracks are starting to show in Hungary's commitment, as
they are in the rest of the military alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Socialist opposition camp, which earlier agreed
to allow the use of Hungarian air space for NATO, have called for a
new vote on the resolution. A recent poll by Teledirect showed that
72 percent of Hungarians opposed air strikes from Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   And while Hungarian voters want to be in NATO, they do not
always want to accept the responsibilities associated with it,
according to surveys by the respected Median polling institute.
</P>
<P>
   Before and after the bombing, a solid 60 percent wanted to be in
NATO, studies from March and April show. But two-thirds say no NATO
troops should be sent from Hungary; just 10 percent think Hungarian
troops should go; and only 26 percent of people think Hungarian
soldiers in general should have to defend other NATO members, which
is a basic element of the NATO mutual-defense charter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We joined NATO for security and peace. Then, right after we
joined, NATO got into a shooting war, and it stunned people. They
are thinking, `Is this what we bargained for?' '' said Laszlo
Kondor, a 58-year-old photographer who fought for the United States
in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's demands ``are a good wakeup call for Hungary,'' Kondor
said. ``People here need to understand there is no free lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Hungary is also feeling an economic pinch. Nearly 8,000
Yugoslavs, both ethnic Albanians and Serbs, have come to Hungary
requesting asylum. Another 35,000-40,000 are staying with friends
and family here, waiting out the war, said Foreign Ministry
spokesman Gabor Horvath.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary's once-blossoming tourist industry is likely to take a
substantial hit, dropping from $1.3 billion in 1998 to an estimated
$1 billion this year because of travelers' worries about touring
just north of the war zone, according to a study released Wednesday
by GKI Economic Research said.
</P>
<P>
   Hungarians are also nervous that they, or the 400,000 ethnic
Hungarians living in nearby Vojvodina, will become targets of
retribution if troops or fighter planes are sent from Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   Vojvodina, a nothern province of Serbia, is best protected by a
speedy NATO victory, British Defense Secretary George Robertson
told reporters after meeting with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor
Orban Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's scare-mongering to say Vojvodina would be
next in the drive for ethnic purity,'' Robertson said, and Hungary
must do its part in the war effort.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and the European Union are ``attractive to join and bring
benefits,'' he said. ``But they also bring heavy responsibilities,
too.''

SCIENTISTS ACT TO CONTROL SPREADING SALMON VIRUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The mysterious virus that killed Atlantic salmon at a
Massachusetts fish hatchery last winter has been detected in fish
from three more Maine rivers, prompting a multistate scientific
effort to understand the disease before it threatens the tiny
population of one of the Northeast's premier sportfish.
</P>
<P>
   None of the six salmon whose blood tested positive for the virus
this month showed signs of the tumors that killed salmon at the
North Attleborough, Mass. federal hatchery. However, biologists
were concerned to find the virus at all: It has now been detected
in four of the seven Maine rivers that are the focus of efforts to
restore salmon runs decimated by dams and pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the unsettling findings, state officials began releasing
2.3 million young salmon fry into the rivers this month to boost
populations. Biologists said the fry would have died in captivity
anyway because hatcheries lack facilities to raise salmon to
adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   The virus ``is certainly a cause for concern,'' said Donald
Hoenig, a Maine Department of Agriculture veterinarian who chairs
the state fish health technical committee. ``Whether we should be
alarmed at this point, I would hold off on that.''
</P>
<P>
   However, state and federal officials are taking no chances,
sending fish to a US Fish and Wildlife lab in West Virginia for
analysis and holding for research 500 to 1,000 salmon fry whose
parents came from rivers where the virus has been detected.
Meanwhile, researchers at Cornell University are studying the
virus, and they have already developed an early detection test.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists hope that the so-called swim bladder sarcoma virus
has always been present at low levels in the Atlantic salmon
population, and they have only noticed it for the first time. They
theorize that the outbreak at the North Attleborough hatchery,
which killed 82 of 276 salmon in one group, was triggered by stress
not normally found in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   But some observers fear the virus is a new invader, perhaps
imported by aquaculture facilities that raise salmon in pens on the
coast. Hoenig said aquaculture is an unlikely suspect since the
virus has not been detected among the pen-raised fish.
</P>
<P>
   Still, researchers have frustratingly little evidence because
the virus is newly discovered, and there are few similar documented
outbreaks among fish.
</P>
<P>
   Maine's effort to rebuild salmon stocks centers on hatcheries,
where fish are segregated according to the river their parents came
from. That way, each of the seven eastern Maine rivers in the
program gets a genetically separate population that returns each
year to spawn.
</P>
<P>
   After the outbreak at North Attleborough last year, state
officials had to quarantine a second hatchery that raised fish from
the same river, the Pleasant. Two of 150 salmon tested positive for
the virus, and all the fish were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Before releasing this year's fry, officials at the US Fish and
Wildlife Service hatchery in East Orland used the Cornell blood
test to determine if the virus was present. To their
disappointment, they found a small number of fish from the
Narraguagus, Machias and East Machias Rivers all carried the virus,
though they showed no signs of illness.
</P>
<P>
   John Coll, regional chief of fish health at the fish and
wildlife service in Pennsylvania, said he is encouraged that only
three adults out of more than 150 tested carried the virus, along
with another three juveniles, called smolts. However, he was quick
to avoid drawing conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not sure what it means yet,'' he admitted, and he
expected more testing in the fall when the fish return to spawn.

   BRUSSELS _ As NATO wrestles with whether to dispatch combat
troops to Kosovo, there is no longer a unified NATO strategy about
how to win the war. And without Washington providing a clear
direction, Britain, Germany and Italy have begun to publicly
promote separate and conflicting plans.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been unable to quiet the unruly chorus
because it has not made up its own mind about how to bring the war
to a successful close. As Washington's allies lock horns over the
risks and advantages of a land campaign, President Clinton has said
only that he is not excluding the option.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have is a committee that lacks a chairman,'' said Ivo
Daalder, the former director of European Affairs at the National
Security Council. ``There is a lack of direction because no one is
leading the way.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's confusion is, no doubt, welcome news for President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia. From the start, his strategy has
been to ride out the air war, encourage divisions within the
Western alliance and try to negotiate a Kosovo settlement on his
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, events at NATO headquarters this week provided ample
evidence of dissension within the ranks. British Foreign Minister
Robin Cook started off the week by reminding the alliance that time
was running out for NATO's plan to return ethnic Albanian refugees
to Kosovo before the winter. He urged NATO to quicken the pace by
considering a land attack after Serb troops were weakened by
several more months of air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The British plan, however, was greeted Wednesday with
undisguised contempt by German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   Under political pressure from pacifists in his coalition
government, Schroeder told a closed-door meeting of NATO
ambassadors that Germany wanted the air war to continue but would
not back a NATO ground attack. That was a significant statement
since there cannot be an allied land campaign without the approval
of all 19 NATO members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not participate in this specifically British debate on
war theories,'' Schroeder later said in caustic remarks to the
press. ``I am against any change in NATO strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was just the German view. The Italians have their own
political problems: leftists in Italy's government's coalition have
complained about allied air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with the criticism at home, Italy has fashioned its own,
somewhat convoluted plan. It has urged NATO to impose a 48-hour
bombing pause after the United Nations Security Council agrees to a
resolution outlining the principles of a peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   If Belgrade still balked, Italy says, NATO could restart its air
strikes and mount a land campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each country has to deal with its own domestic
constituencies,'' a senior Western diplomat said. ``Like everything
in NATO, this will depend on where the United States comes down.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressing question is whether air strikes alone will enable
NATO to attain its objectives. And if it does not, should the
alliance compromise with President Milosevic or raise the stakes by
sending in ground troops?
</P>
<P>
   Washington has yet to declare its hand, virtually inviting a
continuation of the noisy debate. Top Clinton administration
officials have said there is no allied agreement for a land
campaign without noting that Washington has done nothing to create
a consensus.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's indecisiveness recalls the
embarrassing round of diplomacy it conducted when it first began to
grapple with the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, when the war in Bosnia raged, the White House developed
a plan to use air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs and to arm the
Bosnian Muslims. Instead of telling the Europeans that this is how
the allies needed to proceed, however, the Clinton administration
dispatched Secretary of State Warren Christopher to solicit the
allies view on the option.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans were surprised that the world's superpower was in
a listening mode and did not hesitate to rebuff the idea. It took
two more years, and countless lives, before the Clinton
administration insisted that the allies go along with its plan.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Washington is putting off the difficult decision on ground
troops for as long as possible in the hope that the Milosevic
regime, not NATO, will crack.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning preparations for a land war, Western officials
acknowledge, would be a wrenching decision for NATO under any
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   But one diplomat added: ``It's hard to envisage the alliance
coming to terms with the issue until the leader of NATO is prepared
to make a decision,''

BREAD LOAVES PROVE SALVATION TO KOSOVAR REFUGEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ The food chain, spanning continents and
cultures, doesn't quite end with the seven loaves of bread in Adem
Kruiziu's arms.
</P>
<P>
   As he does once a day every day, the construction worker and
Kosovar refugee still has to dole them out to the 15 relatives who
accompanied him to Kukes six weeks ago. It's his job to make sure
that none of the children and adults who make up the displaced
Kruiziu clan go hungry, and it's his job to pick up the loaves from
the back of a relief agency's truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bread is everything,'' said Kruiziu, a 34-year-old father
of five. ``I ate it for breakfast and I will eat it with dinner. We
eat it with beans, with canned meat, with every meal.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Kruiziu, hundreds of thousands of Kosovar refugees now
living in Albania consider bread both sustenance and soccer
equipment. The free loaves, thousands baked locally in Kukes,
thousands more trucked up from the south, are so plentiful that
some youngsters use them to practice kicking goals. Others rot in
piles in a neighborhood park. Pilfered sacks of wheat also
sometimes turn up for sale at local markets.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the fat, golden loaves appear to be used as
intended: as a cheap, easily deliverable staple in a country
overwhelmed overnight by the number of newcomers it must feed. Each
one is expected to sustain two to four people a day, depending on
their other rations, and some refugees joke that they plan to cut
bread from their diet as soon as they return home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is good they give us bread,'' Zade Cholku said through a
translator as she waited in line for the six loaves that her family
of 10 consumes daily. ``They give us a lot of bread. In the two
months we are here, we eat more bread than in all our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The loaves that Choklu and another 30 or so refugees were
waiting to collect outside one of the tractor camps that have
sprung up around Kukes started as surplus US wheat, although Japan,
Turkey and the European Union have donated tons and tons of it,
too. Arriving mostly by ship, the wheat flour's international
flavor expands anew once inside Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Sweden, for instance, has donated a fleet of 20-plus trucks,
drivers and crews to load the flour at the dock in Durres and
unload it at one of the warehouses maintained by the World Food
Programme, the United Nations agency that is overseeing the entire
operation. NATO, the US Army and Albanian truck drivers have also
helped transport enough to provide Kosovar refugees in Kukes alone
with 35,000 loaves of bread a day.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 cents a loaf, paid by the food program with UN funds, the
employees at a half-dozen Kukes bakeries work from before dawn on
to provide their share of the bread. On a recent morning, a human
chain formed outside the bakery where Osman Qoqaj pulls 4,000 black
bread pans a day from six ovens, one batch after another after
another. The men, many of them volunteers, were passing two loaves
at a time from shelf to man to truck in the most efficient way,
perhaps the only way, to move that much bread several times a day.
</P>
<P>
   Himself a Kosovar refugee and third-generation baker Prizren,
Qoqaj said he lines up like everyone else for his own extended
family's share of bread. Thirty-three relatives are currently
sharing a one-room apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a bit sick of bread myself, but I'm glad for the work,''
said Qoqaj, a 29-year-old father of one who landed the job a month
ago, almost as soon as he arrived. ``And it's good to be helping in
the best way I can.''
</P>
<P>
   All told, Kukes bakeries provide 7,000 loaves a day, with
another 25,000 arriving from Albania's largest bakery in Elbasan. A
mobile bakery in Shkodra, as well as four bakeries there, bring
total production to about 50,000 loaves a day _ a number that will
double when a new mobile bakery goes into operation and additional
bakers are hired to provide bread to the new and fast-growing
refugee camps in southern Albania.
</P>
<P>
   From the bakers, non-governmental relief agencies take over
delivery, a system that appears to work better in the camps near
cities than in outlying villages where both Kosovar refugees and
Albanians displaced by Serb shelling along the Yugoslavia-Albania
border are living with host families. Although those refugees do
not yet receive fresh bread, they complain that supplies of wheat
and other basics such as sugar, beans and cooking oil are not
reaching them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no food, no flour, nothing,'' said Hamdi Gajraku, 50,
a construction worker forced to relocate along with 25 relatives
and about 250 other Albanians from their border village to a safer
spot in the hills above Kukes. ``The international community has
done nothing for us.''
</P>
<P>
   As they do in Kukes, Gajraku and about two dozen other
``delegates'' stood waiting for the trucks to arrive. But Reiseal
NiChilleachair, a representative with a distribution agency called
CONCERN, fretted that she could not verify who was a refugee and
who wasn't, and that the food would not reach the right 259 people.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Kukes, attempts are also made to ascertain who is
entitled to the free bread. An employee with Catholic Relief
Charities, which distributes the loaves locally along with the
Adventist Development and Relief Agency, read out names from a list
at each stop. But scores of children had already grabbed as many
loaves as they could carry in their arms and every so often an
impatient adult reached into the pile and popped a half-dozen
loaves into a sack, purse or plastic bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a beneficiaries list, where we've identified group
leaders or the heads of refugee families who can pick up the
bread,'' said Kim Wahlberg, a project coordinator with Catholic
Relief who helps distribute 5,000 loaves a day from the back of the
agency's two white trucks. ``It doesn't always go exactly as
planned, but we know we're getting the bread to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Luke Stephens, a project coordinator wth MedAir, a Swiss
non-profit agency that manages a transit center and has so far
served 70,000 meals of hot soup, ``As far as I can tell, there
aren't any cracks to fall through. You don't see anyone going
hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   Around lunch-time earlier this week, Driton Sahatgiu, a Kosovar
who works one of the Catholic relief trucks for what he described
as decent pay, climbed down, helped spread a cloth on the ground
and began unloading the bread he had loaded only hours ago. On a
typical day, he said, his group makes three bread runs _ morning,
noon and night _ and hands out at least 1,700 loaves at 22 sites
around Kukes.
</P>
<P>
   For Sahatgiu, bread has become both a way to make a living and a
way to keep his mind off his refugee status. Surrounded by the rich
aroma of fresh-baked loaves, a smell that he said reminded him of
home, he bemoaned the dirty, dilapidated hotel where his family now
lives. In Kosovo, they owned two houses, and he stayed behind alone
to protect one until three weeks ago. His wife, mother and other
relatives had been sent ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm doing is good, the money is OK ...,'' Sahatgiu said
in English mid-way through the bread run. ``But someone just told
me that my cousin who is in the (Kosovo Liberation Army) is dead. I
don't want to believe it. I have to find out if he is alive. I'm
going to try to figure out how to do that between deliveries.''

AFTER 70 YEARS, REMAINS OF 2,000 INDIANS ARE BEING RETURNED HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ In what experts believe is the largest single
return of American Indian remains, the bones of nearly 2,000 Pueblo
Indians set out for home Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 a.m., a 53-foot semi-trailer loaded with boxes of skeletons
began the long journey from Harvard's Peabody Museum, where the
bones have been stored and studied for more than 70 years, to the
ancient Pecos Valley site in New Mexico from where they were
excavated.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, from the New Mexican village of Jemez, the
descendants of the dead Pecos set out on a three-day foot trek to
meet them _ about 200 of them walking through the chilly mesa dawn
among rabbit brush and wildflowers, family dogs frisking at their
heels.
</P>
<P>
   The truck and the trekkers are to rendezvous Saturday for a
private mass reburial that tribal leaders say will cap a process
both solemn and full of the joy of rightful return.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are real grateful, happy and proud that our ancestors are
on their way home,'' said Pete Toya, the war chief of the Pueblo of
Jemez.
</P>
<P>
   Since Congress passed the Native American Graves Protection and
Repatriation Act of 1990, skeletal remains and sacred objects have
been returned by museums to the tribes where they originated, as
mandated in the law.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 10,000 skeletons have been returned from possibly
100,000 stored at museums, estimated Thomas W. Killion, director of
repatriation at the National Museum of Natural History. His museum
alone has returned about 4,000 sets of skeletal remains, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But no single return has been as big as this one, and that is in
part because there has rarely been a Native American dig as big as
the Pueblo of Pecos excavation overseen by Alfred V. Kidder, an
archeological pioneer, from 1915 to 1929.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the largest collection in U.S. history, in terms of
material culture and human remains, from a single site
assemblage,'' said William Whately, the tribe's archeologist.
</P>
<P>
   Kidder went to the Pecos site specifically to lead a giant dig
that would help lay the foundation for modern archeological
techniques. The Pueblo of Pecos had been a significant southwestern
crossroads for half a millennium, one of the legendary cities of
gold sought by the Spaniards. But by the 19th century it had fallen
on hard times, and the remnants of its once-rich population
migrated to the Pueblo of Jemez in 1838 and effectively merged with
its people.
</P>
<P>
   Kidder set the standard for modern archeology when he excavated
the Pecos site, said James W. Bradley, an archeologist and director
of the Robert S. Peabody Museum in Andover, Mass., which has many
Pecos artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time that anyone went to major site and took
it apart stratographically _ sort of deconstructed it, and by
taking each of the layers off, understood the process by which that
site had been created,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Kidder's finds, Bradley, said, turned into a kind of Rosetta
stone for the Southwest, providing critical clues about who lived
where when.
</P>
<P>
   The Pecos remains also provided valuable material for research
by physical anthropologists into how the early Indians lived; and
medical researchers took advantage of the statistical power offered
by such large numbers of skeletons to perform studies on
osteoporosis, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM) But times changed, and calls to redress the
wrongs done to Indians mounted. Soon after the repatriation act
passed in 1990, the descendants of the Pueblo of Pecos began to
discuss how to bring the remains home.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bradley at the Peabody Museum in Andover
contacted the tribe, as the law required, to let it know the museum
had material _ not skeletons, but masses of artifacts like pottery
_ that it believed it might be obligated to return.
</P>
<P>
   The pueblo's response was brief and to the point, Whately said:
``We know and let's talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and Whately said the two sides treated each other all
along with the utmost respect. Soon, the other Peabody Museum, the
Harvard one with the skeletons _ formally called the Peabody Museum
of Archaeology and Ethnology _ joined the process.
</P>
<P>
   Though the talks were largely amiable, the return process was
fraught with deep emotion. In 1996, when a tribal delegation first
entered the Peabody Museum room where hundreds of their ancestors'
remains were stored, the pain was overwhelming, those present said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walked into that room, and got together with our
ancestors, that was emotionally disturbing _ I shed some tears,''
Toya, the war chief, said. ``And then, being there for a couple of
hours, then, I guess, they told me that they were going back home.
And we've been working on it ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   As Whately described it, after a few minutes of sorrow ``every
single person in the room was overcome with a feeling of joy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When the joy came to us it was a pretty clear indicator they
were telling us one thing and one thing alone: `We want to go
home,''' Whatley said.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For all the descendants' happiness, the return of the bones hasa
downside for the scholars who can no longer study them.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the bones' reburial meant a loss to researchers,
Barbara Isaac, assistant director and coordinator for repatriation
at Harvard's Peabody Museum said ``Yes'' _ but then qualified:
``Probably. We wouldn't know at this point what that research would
be. A great deal has already been done.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley at the Peabody Museum in Andover agreed that the bones'
return meant a certain loss to researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could additional work be done? Of course,'' he said. ``But we
are a culture of values, and one of our values is that you don't
exploit people.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all repatriations go so smoothly. Lawrence Hart, a Cheyenne
member of the federal review committee that oversees how the
repatriation act is carried out, said there are often disputes over
whether particular sets of remains can be positively identified as
coming from particular tribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, the act is really being implemented well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Jemez Pueblo would surely agree. As the Jemez
Pueblo trek through the mesas and across the Rio Grande got under
way Wednesday, Stuart Gachupin, one of its coordinators, took a
break and exulted: ``We're happy that our ancestors are coming
home.''

U.S. BUSINESSES TROUBLED BY SURGE OF CHINESE NATIONALISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ When anti-American demonstrations erupted in
Chinese cities earlier this month, executives at several U.S.
companies went into crisis mode and evacuated employees. In Beijing
and Shanghai, some Americans felt trapped inside their homes,
fearful that angry students could turn into unruly mobs.
</P>
<P>
   As scary as the demonstrations looked, calm returned in a few
days, and there was little violence. Despite official and popular
anger aroused by the accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade by U.S. aircraft under NATO auspices, no Americans were
seriously injured. And though some companies have postponed
advertising plans or delayed executive visits, the palpable impact
on American business here has been moderate.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials have sought to reassure executives that their
operations are safe and that economic reform policies will
continue. Yet the true damage may not be physical as much as
psychological.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term effects of China's recent surge of nationalist
emotion trouble many American businessmen. It may be too early to
tell exactly how the business environment will be affected, but the
politically radical language that has dominated China's official
media _ an indicator of internal political struggle _ signals a
slowing of some reforms and greater uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same guys who are telling us everything is OK are going
out and encouraging students to take to the streets,'' said the
chief representative of a multinational corporation, who works in
Beijing. ``How much confidence does that give you?''
</P>
<P>
   Communist Party politics still dominate policy-making in
Beijing, where decisions are highly secretive and nationalism is an
unwieldy trump card. Yet market economics have become steadily more
entwined in Chinese politics over the years, and today, foreign
investment is a major concern because it has proved a critical
ingredient in the nation's locomotive-like economic growth over the
last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investment is falling this year, principally because
Asian neighbors hurt by the regional economic crisis have scaled
back operations. Chinese officials are concerned that too sharp a
drop could affect China's growth rate, with a target of 7 percent
this year, slightly lower than the 7.8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   China's Foreign Trade Ministry announced Wednesday that foreign
direct investment fell 12.6 percent in the first four months of the
year to $10.24 billion, compared with the similar period of 1998.
Over all, foreign investment is expected to fall to about $30
billion this year from $45.6 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   American enthusiasm for investing in China has gone in cycles,
with waves of interest inevitably followed by cycles of
disillusionment. The almost immeasurable size of China's market,
and the romance of an exotic culture, has sometimes obscured the
perennial problems of corruption, interference by local officials
and unenforceable laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit scary,'' said Benny Chiu, a China research analyst
for HSBC in Hong Kong, referring to the recent unrest. ``But once
everything calms down, other problems look much more serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Some American business executives are eager to counter what they
feel was an exaggerated depiction of recent events.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a limited impact,'' said John Sullivan, vice
chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing. ``A
handful of companies suspended operations for a day or so, but that
was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan complained that television coverage of the
demonstrations in Beijing created the impression that the whole
city was under siege, while the rock-throwing was actually limited
to the diplomatic quarter in one section of town, and had only a
moderately negative effect on business.
</P>
<P>
   Two Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants in the southern city of
Changsha were wrecked, but 308 other KFC outlets in 70 cities
around China were undamaged. United Airlines, the UAL Corp unit,
suffered a wave of cancellations by scared tourists, as did many
hotels, although several reported recovering bookings this week.
</P>
<P>
   In Shanghai, senior officials met with foreign investors early
last week to try to ease concerns. Mayor Xu Kuangdi traveled to
General Motors' $1.5 billion plant where Buicks are assembled,
while a vice mayor met with several representatives of leading
American banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shanghai will continue to welcome foreigners to make
investment in this city,'' said Xia Zhongguan, a senior official at
the Shanghai Foreign Investment Commission. ``Politics should be
separated from business and trade. The bombing is one thing;
foreign investment is another.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite the efforts of Xia and others to be reassuring, as an
American lawyer in Shanghai noted, it is precisely because some
aspects of China remain so politicized that officials are talking
about the need to separate politics from business. ``This is
clearly being played as a political card by some factions in the
leadership,'' the lawyer said. ``It has economic, political and
psychological effects that are hard to measure. This kind of
campaign hasn't happened here in 25 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Several executives said it was not physical danger that
concerned them, but the unknowns created by a politically volatile
landscape. In a country where courts, every level of official
policy and even nongovernmental organizations can be affected by a
shift in political mood, little is certain.
</P>
<P>
   Many business people said they were surprised by student calls
for boycotts of American goods. But virtually no such boycotts
materialized in an organized way, perhaps in part because American
goods are most popular among young people here.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Chen, director of public affairs for Tricon Global
Restaurants Ltd., which operates 310 Kentucky Fried Chicken and 40
Pizza Hut restaurants in China, said that efforts to organize
boycotts fell flat in part because local KFC managers told
demonstrators that 95 percent of their food was locally produced.
Altogether, KFC employs more than 23,000 people throughout China.
</P>
<P>
   Chen said sales were down about 10 percent to 15 percent last
week, but were expected to be back to normal this week. ``Over all,
the impact was marginal,'' Chen said, adding that plans are
proceeding to open several dozen more outlets this year, expanding
KFC's presence in China to 96 cities from 70.
</P>
<P>
   In an unexpected turn, Chen also said, officials of many cities
became more available to Kentucky Fried Chicken employees than they
are normally, apparently because they were ordered to do so by the
central government. Ordinarily, many businessmen complain, local
officials in Chinese cities are notoriously inaccessible.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a couple of cities, they told us not to hesitate to contact
them,'' Chen said. ``That has never happened before.''

   MONTREAL _ For David Milgaard, hell at the hands of the Canadian
judicial system started in 1969 in his hometown of Saskatoon,
Saskatchewan, when a pretty young nursing aide was raped and
stabbed to death.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the assault suggested that Gail Miller, 20, was
the victim of a serial rapist who had attacked other women at
knifepoint, and police had an obvious suspect in a local man with a
long history of vicious sexual crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, for reasons that today appear almost sinister,
investigators focused on Milgaard, a 16-year-old possessed of a
wild streak _ but whose only prior brush with the law involved a
joyride in a stolen car.
</P>
<P>
   Their case against Milgaard was circumstantial _ he had been
placed in the same neighborhood. But it was the only case they
seriously pursued.
</P>
<P>
   Milgaard was charged, convicted and sentenced to prison. And
that's where his real nightmare began. He was sodomized by
cellmates, and abused by guards. He attempted suicide and made two
desperate escape attempts in his 23 years behind bars. On the
second of these, he was shot by Toronto police.
</P>
<P>
   All along, Milgaard was innocent of the crime. Not ``not
guilty'' by reason of some legal technicality. Truly innocent.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Milgaard's 30-year ordeal came to a close when he was
awarded $7 million by the Canadian and Saskatchewan governments. It
was the largest payout for wrongful conviction in Canadian history.
</P>
<P>
   ``After three terrible decades, it finally feels like it's
over,'' said his mother, Joyce Milgaard, who led the long battle
for exoneration.
</P>
<P>
   Milgaard, now 46, skipped the press conferences and apologies
from government officials to go camping in British Columbia with
his wife, Marnie. ``You can't really appreciate the horrors he's
survived,'' said lawyer Hersh Wolch, part of the volunteer legal
team that challenged the system on Milgaard's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Milgaard suffers from depression so severe he was recently
committed temporarily for treatment at a psychiatric hospital, and
rarely comments on the injustices that threw a boy into prison and
regurgitated him as a middle-aged man.
</P>
<P>
   ``No words can describe it,'' he told reporters two years ago
when a DNA test proved he was not Miller's assailant. ``I always
knew I was innocent. The hardest thing has been the waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The question shouldn't be: `How do I feel about
this?' The question should be, `How did this happen?' ''
</P>
<P>
   As part of an unprecedented federal and provincial deal with
Milgaard's family, Saskatchewan pledged to mount a public inquiry
into a case that has drawn international attention and tarnished
the image of Canadian justice.
</P>
<P>
   But observers give Canadian officials credit for finally making
an unequivocal apology to Milgaard and agreeing to the
extraordinary payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least Canadians still have the ability to blush,'' said
Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter, the American former prizefighter whose
unjust conviction for a triple homicide in New Jersey was
immortalized in a Bob Dylan ballad and is the subject of an
upcoming film starring Denzel Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mistakes like David Milgaard at least stir some sense of shame
among Canadians,'' said Carter, executive director for the
Toronto-based Association for the Wrongfully Convicted, who has
received neither apologies nor restitution for his own 20 years
behind bars in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The public inquiry into Milgaard's case is almost certain to
cause major embarrassment to Saskatoon police, whose behavior
appears to have gone beyond bungling and misjudgement to the realm
of conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Crucial files on suspects have vanished and evidence pointing
away from Milgaard was ignored. Incredibly, the police seeme to
have similarly shrugged off tips about the murder weapon and a
string of knife attacks against women that could not have been
perpetrated by Milgaard.
</P>
<P>
   The original suspect in the rape-murder, Larry Fisher, now 49, a
lifelong sexual criminal with seven rape convictions, has been
charged in Miller's death. He is scheduled to go on trial in
October.
</P>
<P>
   The nursing aide died from as the result of 12 stab wounds on
Jan. 31, 1969. The savage attack fit the pattern of Fisher's knife
assaults against women in Saskatchewan. Moreover, Fisher's own wife
refuted his alibi and told police that the paring knife probably
used in the attack was missiong from her kitchen on the day of the
killing. Police never followed up.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, prosecutors insisted on trying Milgaard for the case.
After the teenager's conviction, Saskatoon police files on Fisher
mysteriously vanished, and the prosecution's star witness was
killed in an odd hunting mishap.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the Supreme Court of Canada overturned Milgaard's
conviction because of procedural errors, but urged Saskatchewan to
order a new trial. The province refused, but police and
prosecutors, in bizarre public statements, insisted that Milgaard
was guilty, and that even if he had been wrongfully convicted it
was just tough luck.
</P>
<P>
   That sance was abandoned only when DNA tests showed that semen
found on Miller could not possibly have come from Milgaard.
</P>
<P>
   ``A wrong of the most serious kind was committed,'' said
Saskatchewan Justice Minister John Nilson. ``How did a 16-year-old
end up serving 23 years for a crime he did not commit?''

U.S. REOPENS CASE AGAINST ALLEGED NAZI DEATH CAMP GUARD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, GERMANY, POLAND)  (js) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reopening a case that has haunted the Justice
Department for more than two decades, federal prosecutors went to
court Wednesday to try again to strip U.S. citizenship from John
Demjanjuk, a retired auto-worker from Cleveland who the government
charged was a Nazi death camp guard.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere in the civil complaint that could lead to Demjanjuk's
deportation was there any mention of the charge at the heart of the
government's original case in 1977 against Demjanjuk _ that he was
``Ivan the Terrible,'' the sadistic gas chamber operator who
slashed and beat thousands as he herded them to their deaths during
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   That charge collapsed in a shattering defeat for the Justice
Department in 1993 after contradictory evidence emerged about
Demjanjuk's true identity and a federal appeals court subsequently
found that the Justice Department's Nazi-hunting unit, the Office
of Special Investigations, was ``reckless'' in failing to disclose
potentially exculpatory evidence in its files that another man
might have been the murderous Ivan of the Treblinka death camp.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the government brought a reduced but still searing
array of charges in the civil complaint filed in U.S. District
Court in Cleveland. The complaint retraced some of the lesser
charges in the original complaint accusing Demjanjuk of serving as
a guard at the Majdanek camp in Poland, the Flossenburg camp in
Germany and the Sobibor extermination camp in Poland, a
horrifyingly efficient operation that the Justice Department said
existed for the sole purpose of murdering Jewish civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the government complaint said Demjanjuk was a member
of an SS-run unit that took part in the mass round-up of nearly 2
million Jews in Nazi-occupied Poland who were killed in mass
shootings or in gas chambers.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department official said that the government revived
the case, which was officially overturned last year, in part
because of the seriousness of allegations about Demjanjuk's
activities at camps like Sobibor, one of only five extermination
camps in the entire Nazi network of wartime camps.
</P>
<P>
   The official said that the decision to go ahead with the case,
which was approved by Attorney General Janet Reno, might have
turned out differently had the review of the Justice Department's
action found that prosecutors engaged in ``intentional misconduct''
in identifying Demjanjuk as Ivan. ``But,'' the official said,
``that just wasn't the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Demjanjuk's lawyer, Michael Tigar, reacted critically to the
Justice Department's effort, saying that Demjanjuk was too ill to
survive another court battle and his family was nearly bankrupted
by the long legal fight against the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-two years ago they sued,'' he said. ``After 21 years of
litigation it was determined not only that they had the wrong guy
but that they had defrauded the courts. We hope it doesn't take
that long to demonstrate once again that the Justice Department is
wrong.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The case has stirred deep passions about Nazi war crimes
prosecutions and the ability of the government to try aging
defendants for acts committed more than a half century ago.
Wednesday, leaders of Jewish groups applauded the Justice
Department's decision to revive the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mistake in the case to begin with was that the prosecution
was pinned totally on trying to prove he was Ivan the Terrible at
Treblinka even though there was evidence that he was a guard at
Sobibor,'' said Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal
Center in Los Angeles. ``I think they have a very strong case and
excellent shot at getting him deported from the United States.''

</P>
<P>
   JUILLAIRD-MUSIC-SCHOOL (New York) _ How do you get to Carnegie
Hall? Practice hard, for sure, but take care, too, that your mental
and spiritual development keeps pace with the physical and
technical, to produce a well-rounded individual and artist. Those,
more or less, are the directions the Juilliard School is giving to
young musicians, dancers and actors hoping to find their way to
Carnegie and other prestigious stages. By James R.
Oestreich. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   THEWLIS-BESIEGED-FILM (London) _ When actors sign up for a
movie, they rarely have much notion how it _ or they _ will end up
looking on screen. David Thewlis learned that some years ago with
Mike Leigh. He duly followed the British director's ritual of
spending weeks creating a character down to the tiniest detail. He
won the best actor prize at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival for
``Naked.'' His latest film, Bernardo Bertolucci's ``Besieged,''
which opened in New York on Friday, is a minimalist film set almost
entirely in a Roman palazzo, a love story between two people who
are seldom seen together, who barely exchange words and about whom
we learn little. By Alan Riding. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   HUGH-GRANT-FILMS (London) _ Is Hugh Grant, 38, the very model of
a modern English gentleman? He certainly seemed that way in ``Four
Weddings and a Funeral,'' a hugely successful confection of a film
largely kept afloat by his bachelor character's diffident charm,
self-deprecating wit and endearing air of chronic embarrassment.
Now he has been cast in the same mold in ``Notting Hill,'' a
comedy, opening on Friday, in which he plays the divorced, ironical
owner of a sleepy London bookstore whose life is turned upside down
by the sudden appearance of the world's most famous actress, played
by Julia Roberts. By Sarah Lyall. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ENSEMBLE-THEATER (Undated) _ In the last year or so, the London
stage has come to look like a stalker's den or autograph hound's
lair, so marked is the fashion for embellishing productions with
Hollywood faces. But the odd small voice has been heard, asking
what has happened to the principle of ensemble acting, and that
little chorus has recently been joined by a large voice. ``The work
can be the star, the company can be the star,'' declared Trevor
Nunn, director of the National Theater, in March. And he has
proceeded to prove his point with warmly received revivals of
Shakespeare's ``Troilus and Cressida'' and Leonard Bernstein's
musical version of Voltaire's ``Candide.'' These are the opening
offerings in a special season that by late summer will consist of
six plays, involve some 50 actors, and run concurrently with the
other productions in the National's repertory. By Benedict
Nightingale. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   RICHARD-NELSON-THEATER (London) _ Displacement and exile are
crucial issues to the American dramatist Richard Nelson, whose
plays, perhaps not coincidentally, usually have their premieres in
England, though their author lives along the Hudson River, north of
New York. Nelson has written about American academics in Britain in
his play ``Some Americans Abroad'' and about Britons living in
America in the more recent ``New England.'' But ``Goodnight
Children Everywhere,'' his latest play, opening Off Broadway on
Wednesday at Playwrights Horizons, marks the first time that Nelson
has written a work wholly about the English and set in England. By
Matt Wolf. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CANBY-THEATER (Undated) _ Theater reviews of ``Via Dolorosa'';
``Amy's View'' and ``The Lonesome West.'' By Vincent Canby.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   EAST-IS-EAST-THEATER (London) _ Ayub Khan-Din grew up in the
north of England in suburban Manchester, the eighth of 10 children
born to an English mother and an emigre father from Kashmir,
Pakistan, who between them ran a fish-and-chips shop. The nearest
sibling in the lineup above him was nearly four years older, while
three years separated Khan-Din from his next brother down the row.
And so, recalled the writer and actor, who is now 37: ``I wasn't
part of the older kids or the younger kids. I lived in my own world
and spent a lot of time daydreaming. It paid off in the end.'' For
proof, one need look no further than ``East Is East,'' Khan-Din's
bittersweet, semi-autobiographical comedy about growing up in the
early 1970s in a mixed-race Anglo-Asian household, where there were
often as many as four children to a bed and the toilet was
outdoors. By Matt Wolf. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SARGENT-ART (Boston) _ For half his life, from 1890, when he was
at the height of his career, until his death in 1925, John Singer
Sargent was under contract to produce murals and decorative schemes
for public buildings in Boston. The son of an expatriate New
England doctor, Sargent lived mostly in Europe; but in Boston he
had close friends and family, and he visited often. Boston was the
American city closest to his European sensibility; it understood
him best. And thanks to ``Sargent Summer,'' a series of exhibitions
timed to coincide with the last stop of the Sargent retrospective
at the Museum of Fine Arts (June 27 through Sept. 26), Boston is
once again the city where one can come to a new understanding of
the reticent artist and his art. By Deborah Weisgall. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   VIDEO-ARTIST (North Adams, Mass.) _ A new installation will be
introduced here next Sunday by the video artist Tony Oursler.
Titled ``Optics'' and aimed at investigating the origins of sound
and light media, Oursler's new work was commissioned by the
Williams College Museum of Art in nearby Williamstown and the
Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, called colloquially Mass
MOCA. Oursler's work will have its premiere as part of Mass MOCA's
long awaited opening, also next Sunday. By Ann Wilson Lloyd.

<P>
   CHERMAYETT-PRINTS (East Topsham, Vt.) _ The graphic designer
Ivan Chermayeff, who makes prints from collages of found objects
like old gloves, flattened steel buckets, hole-riddled boards and
rope winders, is now on view at the Ricco/Maresca Gallery in New
York City. By Rita Reif. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-BLUES-RADIO (Undated) _ Every Saturday night, radio
listeners in Istanbul can hear a voice in heavily accented Turkish
welcome them to another evening of blues music. The announcer says,
``Yalniz gercek blues caliyorum,'' which means, ``I only play real
blues.'' I am that announcer. For the last year I've been feeding
the blues habit of educated listeners and, I hope, bringing ever
more Turks into the worldwide family of blues lovers. By Stephen

PRINCIPAL-INDICTED (Phoenix) - In an unusual move, a grand jury has
indicted the principal of a Phoenix elementary school on child
abuse counts, accusing her of failing to stop abuse by a school
counselor. Principal Joanne L. Talazus is accused of seven felony
counts of child abuse and two counts of failure to report injuries
and neglect of minors. Talazus is accused of ignoring the conduct
of Ronald Maldonado Ruelas, 31, a Longview counselor. Ruelas was
indicted earlier on 23 counts of child molestation, indecent
exposure and sexual abuse involving nine victims. By WILLIAM
HERMANN. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
KNIEVEL JUMP (Phoenix) - Advancer on Robbie's jump over the Grand
Canyon. By MARK SHAFFER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MCSTRATEGY (Washington) - Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign
provided us an exclusive inside look at his strategy for winning
the GOP nomination. Story will say that his campaign has targeted
New Hampshire, Arizona and South Carolina as the key early states
to grab early momentum and to bruise front-runner George W. Bush.
McCain is planning to delay buying ads until close to the primaries
and to instead rely largely on free media and on publicity from a
September book tour that will take him to all major media markets
(the book, said to be both emotional and patriotic,, is about the
family military history). McCain hopes to hurt Bush in New
Hampshire, then come home to Arizona, which was about to drop off
the map but is suddenly pivotal again because the Legislature has
opted to retain the early primary date. By JEFF BARKER. Story will
move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
HILLARY (Grand Canyon, Ariz.) - First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
visits the Grand Canyon to promote 70-plus miles of new bike and
hiking trails along the Canyon rims that will, in conjunction with
new light-rail and bus mass transit, help eliminate cars from the
park. By CRIS MOESER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) - Two years after being convicted of seven
fraud counts in a federal trial, former Gov. Fife Syminton, now a
full-time cooking student, remains free, waiting to learn his fate
from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Unlike regular folks,
Symington didn't have to settle for the drive through lane of
fast-food justice. He's feasting on the full gourmet spread. By
E.J. MONTINI Story will move in the ``A'' and ``K'' categories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
NOTARO-COLUMN (Phoenix) - Julia Roberts lifted up her arm to wave
to the crowd and, in turn, the world froze. It was the lead story
on ``Inside Edition,'' ``Entertainment Tonight'' and even, believe
it or not, made the nightly news. The newscasters gasped in horror
and snickered in revulsion as the photo of Roberts was flashed the
screen for five haunting seconds. There, just beneath her
cap-sleeved gown was not evidence of a budding extra head; the
expanding, flapping gills of a fish woman; or even a tumor
equivalent in girth and color tone to a ripe, juicy melon. Nope. It
was just hair. Julia Roberts had the armpits of a ring-tailed
lemur. By LAURI NOTARO. Story moved in the `'L'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SIMONDS-FOOD (Phoenix) - Nina Simonds's research for her latest
cookbook began 27 years ago with a nasty stomachache. ``I was way
too yin,'' she says, explaining that her diet was out of balance
according to the Asian concept of yin and yang. For Americans who
treat such maladies by tossing back a couple of Tums, the idea that
the foods she was eating while studying in China could not only
cause an upset stomach but cure it as well might seem, well,
foreign. But a traditional Chinese physician convinced Simonds that
antacids were not the answer. By BARBARA YOST. Story moved in the
``F'' category. &QL;

NEXT SEASON AT FORT WORTH DALLAS BALLET ... BALANCHINE AND A WORLD
PREMIERE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ An ambitious, widely varied season,
including major works of Balanchine and a generous selection of
contemporary classical ballet, will characterize the Fort Worth
Dallas Ballet's first full season programmed under the leadership
of artistic director Benjamin Houk.
</P>
<P>
   Hired in June 1998, Houk inherited an already-planned season for
1998-99; the 1999-2000 season will reflect Houk's tastes and
ambitions for the company.
</P>
<P>
   However, Houk by no means returns to the Balanchine-centered
philosophy that dominated the company for 11 years under previous
director Paul Mejia, Balanchine works return to the programming in
a big way, with the major evening-length setting of ``A Midsummer
Night's Dream'' and the shorter ``Stravinsky Violin Concerto'' and
``Allegro Brillante,'' set to music of Tchaikovsky.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights will be the world premiere of Trey McIntyre's
``Alice in Wonderland,'' and one American premiere, British
choreographer Graham Lustig's full-length ``Peter Pan.''
</P>
<P>
   One new piece by Houk, with title and subject as yet
undetermined, will also premiere.
</P>

subscription season of five full programs in Fort Worth at Bass
Performance Hall and a shorter subscription season of three full

   KOSOVO-NATO (Brussels) _ Allied divisions over using ground
troops in Kosovo burst into the open today when Germany's
Chancellor came to NATO and declared that his country would block
the alliance from fighting a land war. ``This is first and foremost
a German position,'' said the Chancellor, Gerhard Schroder. ``That
position is also the present position of NATO, and the strategy of
an alliance can only be changed if all the parties involved agree
on it. I am against any change of NATO strategy.'' By Eric Schmitt.

   LOUIMA-TRIAL (New York) _ The trial of four officers accused of
brutalizing Abner Louima took an unexpected turn Wednesday when a
police sergeant testified that one of the officers boasted to him
that he had tortured Louima in a Brooklyn police station restroom.
The sergeant, Kenneth Wernick, said that Officer Justin A. Volpe
showed him a stick that Volpe claimed he had thrust into Louima's
rectum and later watched as Volpe pointed the stick at another
officer's face and said, ``Smell this, smell this.'' By Joseph P.

Pueblo Indians left the Peabody Museum here early Wednesday for the
ancient Pecos Valley site in New Mexico whence they came.
Simultaneously, the descendants of the Pecos skeletons set out on a

TEXS SENATE CLEARS UP GUBERNATORIAL SUCCESSION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The state Senate on Wednesday approved a
constitutional amendment making it clear how the offices of
governor and lieutenant governor would be filled if Gov. George W.
Bush is elected president next year.
</P>
<P>
   Senators also endorsed a constitutional amendment to allow
judges to order a former spouse's wages to be garnisheed for
overdue alimony.
</P>
<P>
   Both measures, which previously had won House approval, will be
submitted to Texas voters in November.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Rick Perry would automatically fill a vacancy in the
governor's office under House Joint Resolution 44, the
gubernatorial succession measure. And the 31 state senators would
choose one of their own to succeed Perry as lieutenant governor
until the 2002 general election.
</P>
<P>
   The lieutenant governor presides over the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was approved, 28-1, with Sen. Mario Gallegos,
D-Galena Park, casting the ``no'' vote.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors said the change was necessary to clarify the current
line of succession to the governorship. It would require the
lieutenant governor to give up that post to become governor,
something that isn't clear in the present Texas Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Gallegos said he opposed the amendment because it could allow
``lame duck'' senators defeated in the November 2000 election to
help choose the next lieutenant governor before they leave office.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 political season not only will decide if Bush becomes
president but also will decide if Republicans can hold onto their
16-15 Senate majority.
</P>
<P>
   During debate on the succession measure last week, Democrats
unsuccessfully tried to add a provision that, in effect, would have
prohibited Republicans from promoting a GOP senator to lieutenant
governor if Democrats regained the Senate majority after the 2000
election.
</P>
<P>
   The wage garnishment proposal, which would strengthen a limited
alimony law that Texas has had for only four years, was approved
27-2.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said the measure, House Joint Resolution 16, is
needed because alimony payments are difficult to collect without
the teeth that garnishment would provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no argument with the employer. There
either is a garnishment order or there is not a garnishment
order,'' said Sen. Chris Harris, R-Arlington, the sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Teel Bivins, R-Amarillo, questioned the proposed
enforcement tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alimony has only been around in Texas for about four years.
The idea of putting employers in the middle of a financial fight
between a husband and a wife doesn't sound to me like a very good
idea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins and Sen. Mike Jackson, R-La Porte, voted against the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you remember that song, `It's Cheaper to Keep Her,'?''
quipped Sen. Royce West, D-Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   State law already allows wages to be garnisheed for child
support.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature approved limited alimony in 1995 as part of a
welfare reform package.
</P>
<P>
   Alimony can be ordered from former spouses who have been
convicted of family violence offenses. It also can be ordered if a
marriage lasted at least 10 years and the former spouse seeking
payments is poor and disabled or is the custodian of a disabled
child who requires so much care the parent cannot leave home to
work.
</P>
<P>
   In other action Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   _ Senators approved 29-0 a bill to close a loophole in the Open
Meetings Act that allows governmental bodies to meet behind closed
doors for staff briefings.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, House Bill 156, must go back to the House for
consideration of Senate changes.
</P>
<P>
   Senators removed an exception that the House had added for the
Texas Transportation Commission. But they provided some
confidentiality for investment conferences involving trustees of
the Texas Growth Fund, a public, equity-oriented investment fund.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jeff Wentworth, R-San Antonio, the Senate sponsor, won
Senate approval of similar bills in three previous legislative
sessions, only to watch them die in the House. This time, he waited
for the House to approve the measure first.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Senate gave final approval on a voice vote to Senate Bill
236, which would ban the execution of mentally retarded murderers.
The legislation by Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, now goes to the
House, where it faces a race with the clock in the days before
lawmakers adjourn May 31.

BASS HALL CHANGES A CITY _ AND LIVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A great concert hall can change the life of
a community the same way a great book or movie can change the life
of an individual.
</P>
<P>
   Reading Thoreau's ``Walden,'' seeing ``To Kill a Mockingbird'' _
or experiencing some other artistic adventure, be it Kubrick or
Hemingway or Handel _ made you a different person, made you see the
world in a different way.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in just one year, Bass Performance Hall has made Fort
Worth a different city and changed lives, on communal and
individual levels.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever one might say about David Schwarz's opulent design _
and it's just as easy to pick apart as ``Walden'' or ``Messiah'' _
he created a building that has made itself the heart of a community
like no other arts venue in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Sports facilities and shopping malls epitomize the communities
of Dallas (Texas Stadium, the Galleria) and Houston (the
Astrodome). The Capitol and the University of Texas are the heart
of Austin.
</P>
<P>
   But since the Bass Hall was dedicated one year ago, the
community life of Fort Worth _ a dusty frontier outpost that was a
musical and cultural backwater within living memory _ has come to
be dominated not by educational, commercial, governmental or sports
facilities, but by an art museum and a multiuse performance hall.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimbell Art Museum and the Bass Performance Hall make Fort
Worth what it is. Just as the Kimbell functions as a home for the
finest visual arts of our civilization, so the Bass Performance
Hall functions as a ``museum'' for the finest musical and dramatic
accomplishments of Western culture. A serious concert artist will
perform in Chicago, New York, Boston, San Francisco or Los Angeles
_ and Fort Worth, before Dallas or Houston.
</P>
<P>
   What makes a hall great? Great acoustics and great ambience, for
starters. Acoustically, Bass Performance Hall is about as good as
possible. Great singers sound terrific there, and great orchestras,
such as the St. Petersburg Philharmonic and the St. Paul Chamber
Orchestra have proved that the room enhances the sound of a fine
ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   And, as Fort Worth Opera general director William Walker says,
``Bass Performance Hall and opera is a marriage made in heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   As for appearances: Will we get tired of those 40-foot angels?
The jury is still out on that. The back of the building is dowdy,
the front bombastic _ but the ambience somehow works out to be more
than the sum of the parts. Approaching Bass Hall before a
performance, one almost always has the sense of being in a lively
urban environment. The journey from the entrances (grandly labeled
``portals'') to the interior can be confusing, but the visual mood
created by the stylish, purposely anachronistic interior _
particularly the beautiful blue dome _ makes a magnificent frame
for fine performances. You really feel that you're in a great hall,
a place where Verdi or Rachmaninoff would have felt at home.
</P>
<P>
   On a more subtle, political level, Bass Performance Hall
guarantees the domination of Fort Worth cultural life by the Bass
family for at least another generation. With the same patience and
etiquette with which they influence megacorporations and
presidents, the Basses subtly bend and direct orchestras, operas
and ballets. Boards and managers may make noise in public, but a
silent nod or shake of the head from a member of the Bass dynasty
is what really matters in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   It cost $61 million, raised from private, corporate and
foundation funds, to build the hall, which is now owned and
operated by the nonprofit, private Performing Arts Fort Worth. The
hall provides a principal performance venue for the Cliburn
Foundation, the Fort Worth Symphony, the Fort Worth Opera and the
Fort Worth Dallas Ballet, plus a home for some presentations by
Casa Manana.
</P>
<P>
   For all of those organizations, the building of Bass Performance
Hall has been a historical transition.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth Symphony previously had offices and a rehearsal
facility in south Fort Worth and performed at Ed Landreth
Auditorium and Fort Worth Convention Center. Now, for the first
time, the symphony has administrative offices, performances and
rehearsals in the same place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a dream come true,'' says symphony Executive
Director Ann Koonsman.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the orchestra has experienced 15 consecutive
sellouts in the 2,050-seat hall; the biggest problem is persuading
ticket-holders who decide not to attend an event to call and turn
in their seats so that other music-lovers can attend. But turnout
for the 1999-2000 season, one year out from the excitement and
curiosity generated by the opening, will be the test of the hall's
long-term effect, Koonsman says.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth Opera experienced such an immediate pressure for
more seats that it added a third performance of its third
production of the season, a first for the company. All three
productions next season will have three performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's expensive to produce an opera there,'' Walker said. ``But
we can handle the expense because of the public response.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker points out that the hall provides a perfect combination
of intimacy and grandeur for opera, and that the company can
produce operas with a subtlety and finesse that wouldn't work at
the Metropolitan Opera.
</P>
<P>
   Lessons have been learned. During the 1998-99 season, the
Cliburn Foundation presented attractions such as the Moiseyev Dance
Company and House of Blues. This year, the Cliburn Foundation will
leave such attractions entirely to Performing Arts Fort Worth and
concentrate on traditional recitals.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cliburn, which established itself as the world's leading
piano competition in less-than-elegant surroundings, can look
forward to presenting its 2001 competition in an environment with a
sense of place perfect for the enjoyment of great piano music.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a downside, too, for some of the smaller groups in
town, who now compete for funding and audiences with a
high-profile, high-prestige venue.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Kreiman, executive director and co-artistic director of
Contemporary Dance/Fort Worth, a small modern-dance company, said
that she's ``excited that Bass Hall is presenting international
dance companies in Fort Worth.''
</P>
<P>
   However, ``as a small arts organization with an ambitious
community-based performance program, it has been difficult for us
to compete with Bass Hall for funds in the community,'' Kreiman
said. ``We don't have as prominent a profile.''
</P>
<P>
   On the upside, she said, ``It is our hope that activities at
Bass Hall will generate greater interest in live performing arts in
our community.''
</P>
<P>
   That would appear to be the case _ and not just with adults. Sue
Buratto, director of the hall's education program, says that 60,000
local schoolchildren have visited the hall. Next season, the
program will reach 70,000 students in grades one to seven.
</P>
<P>
   Bass Performance Hall's managing director, Paul Beard, says that
he has been perplexed by the audience response to a few of the
shows that Performing Arts Fort Worth presented in its subscription
series, particularly the St. Petersburg State Ice Ballet, which
drew a disappointing ticket response. But the group plans to
continue presenting the same number and type of eclectic
performers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has been gratifying has been designing a building that
can present a variety of different events,'' Beard says. ``And to
see that it really works.''
</P>
<P>
   Principal supporters contended during the final phase of fund
raising that Bass Performance Hall would be the last great hall of
the 20th century. On a purely chronological basis, the wonderful
new orchestra hall in Seattle deserves that title, because it
opened in September.
</P>
<P>
   But Bass Performance Hall has achieved a historical aura and

COMMENTARY: AN UNORTHODOX ELECTION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Israel)   By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ehud Barak won a landslide victory in Israel
because of who he was not.
</P>
<P>
   He was not Bibi Netanyahu, a man of the right who angered the
right with the Wye accords, and then infuriated Israel's center by
backing away from that agreement to placate the implacable
hardest-liners.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was he Shimon Peres, a man of the left who was defeated
three years ago by Bibi because his policy of land-for-promises
threatened Israel's security and Jerusalem's unity.
</P>
<P>
   From now on, Barak will be judged on who he is. Because his
Labor Party lost seats in the Knesset, he must form a coalition to
govern. Our first indication of what sort of prime minister he will
make comes in his choice of partners.
</P>
<P>
   He could go left to the doves, the Arab and anti-religious
parties, plus the Russian immigrants. That would divide Israel and
provide no mandate for peacemaking. Won't happen.
</P>
<P>
   He could go religious to Shas, which snatched the mantle of
outsiderhood from the rightist Likud, and is now the third-largest
party. Shas wants money for its schools and day care; once bought,
it would be malleable on all else. Could happen.
</P>
<P>
   He could go right to the battered Likud. Bibi forthrightly
accepted responsibility for its defeat and stepped down. The acting
leader is Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, a sensible hawk whose word
is good, and who has been urging a broad-based coalition to make a
secure peace that most Israelis can live with. Should happen.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, like Bibi, is a bit of a loner. That can be a sign of
security. Six years ago, when he was army chief of staff, he was in
Washington and dropped by my Times office to introduce himself and
express his views _ unencumbered by aides, advisers, agents or
witnesses. That was impressive; he knew his stuff. (So why didn't I
make notes?)
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, when he was serving in the Peres Cabinet, an
Oslo II plan was presented that would hand over to Yasser Arafat
large chunks of the West Bank before final talks began. Barak
pointedly abstained. He agreed not to make his opposition public
lest it be ``misinterpreted.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibi Netanyahu as prime minister inherited that salami-slice
schedule and paid a heavy price in media support for interpreting
it narrowly. He was right: Unless Israel had a sizable portion of
land to hand over at the final settlement, all the focus would be
on the division of Jerusalem, and the talks would fail.
</P>
<P>
   Though gloating at Bibi's fall can be heard more in Tel Aviv,
Gaza and Washington than in Jerusalem, he will be remembered for
his wise slowdown of that land rush as well as a laudable
insistence on Palestinian reciprocity in combating terror. His
political ingratitude needlessly made enemies of his allies, and
their mistaken reaction to his necessary compromises brought him
down.
</P>
<P>
   The new prime minister has saddled himself with a self-imposed
deadline of withdrawing troops from the Lebanon buffer zone. If he
withdrew unilaterally, he would invite the Hezbollah up to the
border to harass northern Israel; if he withdrew as part of an
agreement negotiated with Syria, he might find the price to be the
Golan.
</P>
<P>
   I hope he does not make Rabin's mistake in assuming U.S. troops
would patrol a no man's land atop those Heights. Only Israel can
defend Israel's borders.
</P>
<P>
   Barak will also have to look inward at the division in Israeli
society between secular and ultra-Orthodox. (Black and white, too _
he made a nice reference to the inclusion of the Ethiopian Jews.)
That recalls the question asked by Jewish grandmothers the world
over whenever a great event takes place anywhere: ``Is it good for
the Jews?''
</P>
<P>
   This unorthodox election can turn out to be very good for the
Jews. The political deck has been reshuffled. A consensus about the
Palestinians is emerging. The weakness of the system that
encourages the birth of one-issue parties stands exposed, but the
other side of that coin is that the secular and religious parties
are competing out in the open.
</P>
<P>
   Where does this happen but in a creatively quarrelsome
democracy? Where in the Middle East but in Israel?
</P>

BILL WOULD ALLOW WHOLESALERS TO IMPORT PHARMACEUTICALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an effort to combat soaring prescription drug prices, US Rep.
Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is introducing federal legislation Thursday
to let US retailers import drugs from other countries, where
wholesale prices tend to be much lower.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, Sanders said, is to pass along lower prices to
consumers, particularly seniors. The legislation is co-sponsored by
Representative Marion Berry (D-Ark.) and Representatives Jo Ann
Emerson (R-Mo.).
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of prescription drugs is outrageously high,'' said
Sanders. ``There are seniors in this country who literally have to
make the decision between food and medicine. We have a national
crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders' legislation is the latest effort in Washington to make
medicine more affordable for seniors. Senator Edward M. Kennedy,
Democrat from Massachusetts, has introduced legislation to add drug
coverage under the Medicare program. President Clintonhas suggested
using part of the federal budget surplus to pay for drug coverage
under Medicare, and is reportedly working on a proposal to be
released in coming weeks. And numerous lawmakers have said they
were drafting similar legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceutical industry is staunchly opposed to the Sanders
and Kennedy bills. They say the Kennedy bill would lead to
government price controls, while the Sanders proposal could lead to
the sale of potentially unsafe drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation raises a host of safety concerns that has the
potential to harm millions of patients,'' said Jackie Cottrell,
spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
America in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Sanders bill would allow retailers to buy drugs made in the
United States which are then exported to other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Because many drugs are cheaper outside the United States,
seniors in Sanders' home state of Vermont often hop across the
border to Canada to buy their medications, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A survey commissioned by Sanders showed that the price for 10
commonly prescribed drugs are 81 percent higher in Vermont than if
they were purchased Canada, and 112 percent higher than in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally insane for people to be crossing the border to
buy drugs that are made right in this country,'' Sanders said.
``This is a probusiness, free trade proposal that will allow
consumers in this country to enjoy significantly lower prices.''

BINGHAM DANA TO MERGE WITH HARTFORD LAW FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Bingham Dana, in a deal that raises the Boston law
firm's global profile, said Wednesday it would merge with Hebb &AMP;
Gitlin, a Hartford law firm that recently snared the government of
Indonesia as a client.
</P>
<P>
   Bingham Dana, one of Boston's oldest law firms, has in recent
years been on a mission to expand its international practice,
notably by acquiring the Japan practice of a New York law firm,
Marks &AMP; Murase, in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Hebb &AMP; Gitlin also has international clients, but the firm
gained prominence in London circles in the early 1990s when founder
Richard Gitlin acted as the US administrator in the bankruptcy
proceedings of Maxwell Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really good strategic fit,'' Jay S. Zimmerman, the
managing partner of Bingham Dana, said Wednesday about the merger.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to global practices, the firm's bread-and-butter
legal work in this country also fits, Zimmerman said.
</P>
<P>
   The larger of the two firms, Bingham Dana has 325 attorneys and
a specialty in corporate finance for banking clients, while Hebb &AMP;
Gitlin, which has only 55 attorneys, has a similar standing in the
insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you look at convergence of these two industries'' _ banking
and insurance _ ``this is a natural for us,'' Zimmerman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Globe, which is owned by The New York Times Co., is
among Bingham Dana's clients.
</P>
<P>
   On the international front, Hebb &AMP; Gitlin was hired early this
year by the Indonesian government to help its efforts to
restructure troubled corporate debt and lift the country out of the
economic troubles triggered by its currency crisis last year.
</P>
<P>
   To do this work, the merged firms plan to open an office in
Singapore, which will also help Bingham Dana better serve its
clients in Japan, Zimmerman said. The firms both have London
offices and plan to merge them, allowing them to more effectively
pursue clients in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``As our clients are consolidating into global institutions,''
Gitlin said in a statement, ``we made a strategic decision to
merge.''

COMMENTARY: POLICE RESTRAINT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., N.J.)   By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rachel Ellen Ondersma, a 17-year-old high school senior, was
stopped by the state police in Grand Rapids, Mich., early on the
morning of Nov. 14, 1998. She had been driving erratically. When
she failed a Breathalyzer test, the cops placed her under arrest.
</P>
<P>
   An officer cuffed the girl's hands behind her, put her in the
back seat of a police cruiser and locked the doors, leaving her
alone. What happened after that was captured on a video camera
mounted inside the vehicle. While it would eventually be shown on
the Fox television program ``World's Wackiest Police Videos,'' it
was not funny.
</P>
<P>
   The video camera showed a clear view through the windshield of
the police cruiser. The microphone picked up the sound of Ms.
Ondersma sobbing, and then the clink of the handcuffs as she began
maneuvering to free herself. She apparently stepped through her
arms so that her hands, still cuffed, were in front of her. She
then climbed into the front seat of the cruiser, slid behind the
wheel and started the engine. As officers shouted, ``Hey! Stop!,''
she roared off.
</P>
<P>
   With the car hurtling along, tires squealing, Ms. Ondersma can
be heard moaning, ``What am I doing?'' and ``They are going to have
to kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   I got a copy of the video and studied it, looking closely at the
reactions of the police. Ms. Ondersma was almost immediately chased
by troopers and officers from the Grand Rapids Police Department.
At one intersection a Grand Rapids cop car approached head-on.
Thinking Ms. Ondersma would be forced to stop, the officers opened
their doors and were about to hop out. But Ms. Ondersma careened
into a left turn and sped off.
</P>
<P>
   With several cars chasing her, the drunken teen-ager roared onto
a freeway, where she was clocked at speeds that reached 80 mph. At
least two police cars got into the lane in front of her and slowed
down while another closed in from the right. ``Oh no!'' cried Ms.
Ondersma as she crashed into a concrete median on her left. She
seemed boxed in. The video showed cops leaping from their cars and
heading toward her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ondersma threw the cruiser into reverse, backed up, then
lurched forward, plowing into one of the police cars. At that point
gunfire can be heard as cops began shooting out her tires. The
teen-ager would not stop. She backed up, then lurched forward
again, hitting the cop car one more time. An officer had to leap
out of the way to keep from being struck.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow Ms. Ondersma, a clear and potentially fatal threat to
anyone on the highway, managed yet again to get away. But this
time, with at least two tires flat, she could no longer control the
vehicle. She crashed into another concrete divider and finally was
surrounded.
</P>
<P>
   For me the most astonishing part of the video came next. Ms.
Ondersma, upset, was pulled from the cruiser. She was not treated
roughly. There was no cursing by the police, no ranting and raving,
no evidence that the cops were particularly upset at all. One
officer said to Ms. Ondersma: ``Calm down, all right? I think
you've caused enough trouble for today.''
</P>
<P>
   Every time I watched that video I thought about the incident on
the New Jersey Turnpike in April 1998 in which four young men in a
van were pulled over by state troopers. Three of the men were black
and one was Hispanic. They were not drunk and they were not
abusive. But their van did roll slowly backward, accidentally
bumping the leg of one of the troopers and striking the police
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The state troopers pulled their weapons and opened fire. When
the firing stopped, three of the four young men had been shot.
</P>
<P>
   I wondered what would have happened if a young black guy had
stolen the police cruiser in Grand Rapids and roared off,
endangering lives and damaging property for mile after mile. I
wondered if the troopers on the New Jersey Turnpike would have
opened fire on the minivan if its occupant had been a young white
girl.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Lt. Tom Hunt of the Michigan State Police why the
troopers had exhibited what I found to be such admirable restraint
when dealing with Rachel Ondersma.
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``They made the conscious decision to try to put the
car out of commission instead of her out of commission. That's how
we're trained here.''

GERMAN CHANCELLOR THREATENS TO VETO LAND WAR BY NATO 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Allied divisions over using ground troops in
Kosovo burst into the open on Wednesday when Germany's chancellor
came to NATO and declared that his country would block the alliance
from fighting a land war.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is first and foremost a German position,'' said the
chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder. ``That position is also the present
position of NATO, and the strategy of an alliance can only be
changed if all the parties involved agree on it. I am against any
change of NATO strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   In blunt, caustic remarks at a news conference, Schroeder
derided Britain's position that the allies should consider a ground
force even without a peace agreement if NATO bombing pounds
Yugoslav troops to the point where they can offer only scattered
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not participate in this specifically British debate on
war theories,'' Schroeder said in response to a question from a BBC
correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   After fending off several similar questions, the chancellor
snapped, ``I have said everything that is to be said on this
particular issue and you will not get any more out of me if you go
on pestering me.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany has long opposed sending its own troops into combat in
Kosovo. But the threat from Schroeder to veto any ground force
without a settlement is new, and he sought to put more weight
behind his words by emphasizing that he was also speaking as
chairman of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's reservations about the course of the war in Serbia
were reflected by a vote on Wednesday in the Italian parliament,
committing the government to seek a halt in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   But though the debate in Rome was long and passionate, the
resolution does not bind Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema to lessen
Italy's longstanding support of NATO policy. Still, D'Alema
welcomed the resolution, and the vote was a clear sign of the
growing domestic opposition to the war that is bedeviling Italy as
well as other European governments that are generally committed to
the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference here, even before he took questions,
Schroeder insulted the United States: He implicitly challenged
Washington's official explanation for the bombing of the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade _ that target analysts relied on a faulty
street map _ by renewing his demand for a formal NATO inquiry into
the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats here say Schroeder, who just returned from China, was
angry that a trip he had long planned to herald his chairmanship of
the European Union was transformed into an official apology for the
embassy bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-member alliance is at a critical crossroads: As time runs
out to prepare hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians to return
to their homes before winter, the allies are badly divided over the
timing and conditions for the use of ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley K. Clark, NATO's military commander, on Wednesday
flew to Washington, where he is expected to brief Defense Secretary
William S. Cohen and Gen. Henry H. Shelton, the chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, on the military options, including both a
peacekeeping force and a land war.
</P>
<P>
   NATO originally envisioned a peacekeeping force of 28,000
soldiers, including 4,000 Americans. The allies' current thinking
is that they will need perhaps 50,000 troops to help police and
rebuild devastated villages in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   No country favors a full-scale invasion against organized
Yugoslav army resistance. But Britain insists that NATO must act
now to prepare for a possible ground attack against battered
Yugoslav troops, an environment military analysts call
semi-permissive.
</P>
<P>
   Greece, however, is urging the allies to suspend bombing for 48
hours as an incentive for President Slobodan Milosevic to
negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution passed by the Italian Parliament on Wednesday
urges a similar suspension, moving a step closer to a unilateral
cease-fire than D'Alema has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema is to meet the NATO secretary general, Javier Solana,
here on Thursday. Italy opposes sending ground troops now but has
left open the possibility of doing so if Belgrade balks at a peace
deal set up by a Secretary Council resolution. But the wording of
the Italian resolution was so ambiguous that it did not close any
options for D'Alema.
</P>
<P>
   NATO members are split largely because the United States is
sitting on the fence.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said on Tuesday that ``all options'' remained
open, but on the same day Schroeder contradicted him, saying that
sending in ground troops without a settlement is ``unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO diplomats whom Schroeder addressed in a closed meeting
before the news conference said the chancellor stressed the same
theme of maintaining the air attacks and diplomatic campaigns, but
made his points in more muted tones.
</P>
<P>
   American diplomats here said Schroeder's remarks were directed
more at his domestic audience than at the international community.
Thus it is unclear whether Germany would carry out its threat to
block a NATO force if the alternative were outright failure.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion in favor of the air war has been slipping in
Germany at the same time that pacific strains in German politics
are resurgent.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party, a junior partner in Schroeder's government, has
become more vocal in opposing the bombing, leading to fears that a
severe split could bring down the fragile coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Milosevic wants to divide NATO. Belgrade's insistence
that it is willing to reach a diplomatic accord only exploits the
allied bickering over the dual-track strategy of diplomacy and war.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats from the seven leading industrial nations and Russia
met in Bonn Wednesday to work out draft language for a United
Nations Security Council resolution. The officials were briefed by
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbot, who had met for two days
with Finnish and Russian leaders in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian envoy, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, on Wednesday flew to
Belgrade, where he demanded a halt in the air strikes and then
immediately went into a meeting with Milosevic. On Thursday, Talbot
and President Martii Ahtisaari of Finland are to meet Chernomyrdin
in Moscow to review the diplomatic approaches.
</P>
<P>
   But the alliance has staked out tough conditions for Milosevic
to meet before the air war ends, leaving NATO with little
negotiating room. One condition, for example, is that Milosevic
withdraw his 40,000 troops from Kosovo before the allies halt the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder said Wednesday, however, that Germany would support a
compromise between that position and the Italian plan to suspend
bombing for 48 hours after a Security Council resolution was
approved.
</P>
<P>
   The allies may also have to sacrifice a possible indictment of
Milosevic for war crimes to negotiate a deal that ensures the
refugees' return before winter. ``That is such a primordial
objective of such primordial importance that all other
considerations fall by the way for a certain amount of time,''
Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters later, NATO's civilian spokesman, Jamie P.
Shea, insisted that the allies remained united in their goals and
opposed to any compromises of their key conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to offer any carrots,'' Shea said.

   KOSOVO-NATO (Brussels) _ Allied divisions over using ground
troops in Kosovo burst into the open Wednesday when Germany's
chancellor came to NATO and declared that his country would block
the alliance from fighting a land war. ``This is first and foremost
a German position,'' said the Chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder. ``That
position is also the present position of NATO, and the strategy of

on it. I am against any change of NATO strategy.'' By Eric Schmitt.

ALBRIGHT AND SENATORS PAY TRIBUTE TO AIDE TO HELMS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Va.)   By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   McLEAN, Va. _ After the organist had begun playing and just
before the soprano soloist began singing ``Swing Low, Sweet
Chariot'' at Rear Adm. James W. Nance's funeral, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright was ushered down the aisle and seated in a front
pew next to Sen. Strom Thurmond.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sen. Jesse Helms, leaning heavily on an aluminum cane, came
through a side door and walked a few paces to sit with the Nance
family, across the aisle from Ms. Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Nance, Helms' childhood friend from North Carolina who came out
of retirement to become chief of staff of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, did not want an elaborate Washington funeral,
according to friends, and he did not get one.
</P>
<P>
   No prominent officials spoke, just the pastor, the Rev. Gary G.
Pinder; Nance's younger son, Andrew; and a granddaughter,
Catherine. The pallbearers and ushers were old friends, not
celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   But the funeral was not a typical one for a congressional aide,
even one as senior as Nance, who was 77 and died on May 11 of
complications of myelodysplasia, a blood disease. The presence of
the secretary of state, other State Department officials, including
Barbara Larkin, assistant secretary for Legislative Affairs, and
two busloads of senators and staff members was a statement of
respect for the admiral and for Helms.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Helms,
the prickly and powerful North Carolina Republican whose moniker is
``Senator No,'' has held hostage various Clinton administration
nominees for ambassadorial and other foreign posts. Albright,
throughout her tenure, has taken pains to court Helms. She even
accompanied him to his home state in a 1997 visit.
</P>
<P>
   Nance worked at his Senate post until the week before he died,
even though in the last months he had appeared increasingly ill and
required weekly transfusions that he called ``in-flight
refueling.''
</P>
<P>
   A quiet, confident man who shunned the spotlight, he was a
formidable presence on Capitol Hill because of his unusually close
relationship with Helms. They grew up together in the Depression in
Monroe, N.C., and the senator prevailed on Nance, who had several
top commands in the Navy and who served on the White House staff in
the Reagan administration, to come out of retirement in 1992 to run
the committee's staff.
</P>
<P>
   Nance's sizable influence, said Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of
Delaware, the top Democrat on the committee, was grounded on the
fact that he was ``one of the few men or women'' who could say to
Helms, ``Enough, Jesse; slow down, Jesse; no, Jesse.''
</P>
<P>
   In a eulogy on the Senate floor on Tuesday, Helms called Nance,
who was known as ``Bud'' to senators and peers, ``a giant of a
man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved Bud Nance like a brother,'' Helms said, his voice
cracking. ``In my final conversation with him nine days ago, I told
him so. His voice, weak and raspy but nonetheless unmistakably
clear, replied, `I love you, too.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nance was buried on a hillside at Arlington National Cemetery.
As his coffin was placed in the ground, Navy fighters flew by in a
missing-man formation _ a V shape except for a missing plane in one
wing, the military's traditional salute to a fallen leader.

BURNS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT BRUINS' FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The numbness had passed and coach Pat Burns was
feeling the sting of disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   His Bruins had been ousted from the Stanley Cup playoffs the
night before and yes, it did hurt, yes, he feels the Bruins were
the better team, and yes, there is reason to be optimistic about
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Burns hit on a wide range of topics Wednesday at the FleetCenter
_ the ups and downs of the season, injuries _ and was willing to
tackle any question thrown his way.
</P>
<P>
   Well, almost any.
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't discuss what was missing from this year's team and
what would be needed next year to take things to the next level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's get one thing straight,'' said Burns. ``I'm not going to
sit here and talk about what this team needs and what this team is
going to do. You can forget that. I'm not going to talk about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to give me some time, you've got to give some time
to management and myself to sit down and go over some stuff and put
in some reports. If we're going to talk about what this team has to
do and will do, we're wasting my time and we're wasting yours.''
</P>
<P>
   With that out of the way, Burns talked about the differences
between the Bruins and Sabres, who won the Eastern Conference
semifinal series in six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had some breaks. They had some good breaks at the right
time,'' he said. ``They had some bounces. We didn't have too many
bounces go our way. But I'm not saying it was just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played (Tuesday) night probably their best game of the
series. It was a non-error game that we just couldn't get through
and it was that close.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're down, 3-1 (in games), everyone knows it's
difficult to get through that. But the team stood up and fought
back and we fought back to the final buzzer. Nobody quit.''
</P>
<P>
   And that pleased Burns to no end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a season of ups and downs, which all seasons are,''
he said. ``I think every team in the NHL has them and we had our
share. In the final six weeks of the season everybody gave it
everything they could to try and get us in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting by the first round was tough. It was hard and we went
through the wall to get through it. The second round, we tried to
get through the wall but there was just a little bit missing. But
I'm very satisfied. I kept on saying I was proud of what the team
accomplished and I still am.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns indicated that Bruins fans may have even better days ahead
when asked if this is where he thought his team would be after his
first two years at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know those things,'' he said. ``It's easy to say at
this time we're at where we wanted to be and if we're not there I
could have said, `Well, we're coming there.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're on the right course, put it that way. The ship
was going the wrong way and now it's going the right way. I think
that's important and now we have to make sure that the right
sailors are on board and tying the right knots.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns warns, too, that neither the fans nor the players should
lull themselves into a false sense of security now that they have
some playoff experience and success under their belts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to say, `Now they've had enough (experience), turn
the light switch on and get the parade ready,' '' he said. ``No, I
don't think so. There's still a lot of things you have to go
through in a playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   ``To really make yourself, you have to learn, you have to be
ready to understand what it takes. Whether or not I can tell you
right now that they know exactly what it takes and there's going to
be no problem, well, I can't promise that. That would be stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally, now that the Bruins are out of the playoffs and
there's no reason to keep injuries a secret, Burns detailed the
ills the Bruins faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Jason) Allison was one guy who had a bad wrist for the last
part of the season. (Sergei) Samsonov had a lower rib and a lower
back that was really painful. Don Sweeney? An amazing individual to
go through what he had to go through. He had his ribs frozen every
single game and it would hurt twice as much the next day than it
did the day he played. Tim Taylor the same thing. Byron's (Dafoe)
back near the end started to tighten up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of things, but that's the playoffs. That's
what makes you get through.''

WOMAN LEFT PARALYZED BY BULLET IS ALLOWED TO DIE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Georgette Smith, saying she could not bear to
live after a bullet left her paralyzed from the neck down, was
allowed to die on Wednesday in an Orlando hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Now, prosecutors are expected to proceed with murder charges
against the woman who left her that way, her own mother.
</P>
<P>
   The 42-year-old Ms. Smith, whose spine was severed at the neck
when her mother fired a bullet into her on March 8, was sedated and
then taken off a ventilator sometime after 5 p.m., after winning
the right in Orange County Circuit Court to end her life.
</P>
<P>
   She died at 5:46 p.m., said Lisa Schultz, a spokeswoman for
Lucerne Medical Center in Orlando. ``She was made as comfortable as
possible,'' said Ms. Schultz, before doctors disconnected her from
the machine that had allowed her to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schultz would not comment on who was with Ms. Smith at her
death, but her two grown daughters have been at her side constantly
since the shooting. Ms. Schultz told a gathering of more than a
dozen television cameras and several newspaper and radio reporters
that the family of Ms. Smith had asked to be left alone.
</P>
<P>
   For almost a decade, Florida courts have held that those who
wish to die to save themselves from a lifetime of pain or hardship
have that right, but Ms. Smith's case drew national attention
because of its circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Her attacker was her mother, Shirley Egan, a tiny, frail,
68-year-old woman who shot her daughter after a discussion they had
about placing Ms. Egan in a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting left Ms. Smith paralyzed and despondent, and she
sued the hospital earlier this month for the right to die. An
Orange County Circuit judge granted her wish on Tuesday, but ruled
that she delay being removed from the ventilator until 5 p.m. on
Wednesday so that lawyers in her case would have time to interview
her at length about the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, who came to see her daughter on Tuesday in a
wheelchair, has already been charged with attempted first-degree
murder and aggravated battery causing great bodily harm.
Prosecutors here had said they would seek a murder indictment
against Ms. Egan if Ms. Smith was allowed to die.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Egan's lawyer has said that Ms. Egan, who is blind in one
eye and has other health problems, did not mean to shoot her
daughter.

 &HT;    Atlanta firm answers call for better phone service
 &HT;    By Don Melvin

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Naomi Shaku lives in the Ebony Park neighborhood on
the east side of Johannesburg, a development of tiny
government-built houses whose single rooms are smaller than a rich
man's bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   These homes were built to house people who previously lived in
squatter camps. These are the poor, people who have precious little
in life.
</P>
<P>
   Shaku, 24, may not have much. But she does have a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   And so, it seems, does almost everyone else in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   From the poor in makeshift shacks of corrugated iron to the rich
in their suburban mansions, from those riding in Mercedes and BMWs
to those traveling only on foot, cell phones are phenomenally
prevalent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people here have cell phones,'' said Shaku,
gesturing toward her neighborhood of one-room, cement block houses.
</P>
<P>
   Her phone, she said, costs her about 200 rands a month, about
$30, and it's worth it. It allows her mother, who is caring for
Shaku's baby, to call her if the baby needs her, and it allows
people doing business with her mother's little store to call if
they have a question or a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has them,'' said Donald Keene, the state of
Georgia's trade representative in South Africa. ``I've never been
in a country where people use cell phones so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials routinely give out cell phone numbers. So
do business people and professionals. If a phone rings in a car
carrying several people, it often occasions a brief debate over
whose phone is going off.
</P>
<P>
   Is that mine? Yours? Bip-beep-beep-bip-beep-beep. No, I think
that's his.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons for the heavy cell phone use is that public
phones in South Africa are sparse and do not always function.
Besides, many poorer areas _ like Ebony Park, where Naomi Shaku
lives _ simply are not served by telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Shaku couldn't get a regular telephone installed in her house
for any amount of money.
</P>
<P>
   None of this has gone unnoticed in Georgia. Advanced Charger
Technology, which is based north of Atlanta, plans to introduce
soon in South Africa a new cell phone charger that recharges
batteries faster and more completely than existing ones, said Jody
Steinberg, the company's communications manager.
</P>
<P>
   What's the company's assessment of cell phone use in South
Africa?
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it to be explosive,'' Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   And the potential is great not only in South Africa but across
the continent, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no infrastructure,'' she said. ``They will have
wireless before they have land lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaku did not speak of infrastructure, but she said essentially
the same thing: She has no other way to keep in touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only contact people have,'' said her friend, Esther
Mashubuku, also 24, as she leaned against the door of one of the
boxy little government houses in Ebony Park. ``We don't have
telephones here.

 &HT;    U.N. Foundation awards $21 million to 11 projects
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The United Nations Foundation, the organization
created to disburse Atlanta businessman Ted Turner's 10-year, $1
billion gift to U.N. causes around the world, announced its fourth
round of grants Wednesday, giving $21 million to 11 projects which
range from providing birth control for Kosovar refugees to
protecting the environment of the Galapagos Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The board, which includes Turner and former Atlanta Mayor Andrew
Young, awarded the grants at a meeting last week in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The board is working to sharpen its focus, to avoid scattering
its resources too widely, said David Harwood, a spokesman for the
foundation. That process will continue at the board's next meeting,
in November, when members will award money almost exclusively to
projects dedicated to improving the health of children, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The board is also working to design projects that promote
cooperation between different U.N. operations, that leverage money
from the private sector, and that can be replicated elsewhere in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   In its 18 months of operation, the foundation has awarded $108
million. About a quarter of that has gone to children's health;
another fourth to protecting the environment; 35 percent to
population control and improving the lives of women; and 16 percent
to other U.N. causes.
</P>
<P>
   The grants announced Wednesday, each of which goes to one or
more U.N. agencies, are:
</P>
<P>
   _ $1,865,650 over three years to slow the spread of HIV and AIDS
among youth of southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
   _ $1.5 million over two years to support efforts to use the
media worldwide to help create a tobacco-free world.
</P>
<P>
   _ $3,999,850 to help protect the 5,000 native species of plants
and animals in the Galapagos Islands from harmful invasions of
non-native species.
</P>
<P>
   _ $2.6 million to support a U.N. partnership with an independent
body to recommend global policy on the future of large dams and
possible alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   _ $2 million to strengthen the U.N.'s monitoring of the global
environment and to supply better information to decision-makers.
</P>
<P>
   _ $370,660 to develop the production of energy by organic means
in rural India.
</P>
<P>
   _ $1.5 million to help promote investment in projects that
generate energy without contributing to global warming.
</P>
<P>
   _ $5,206,000 over three years to strengthen reproductive health
programs in refugee and emergency situations.
</P>
<P>
   _ $1,777,835 over four years to promote ``micro-insurance''
systems for women in West Africa, in which a number of women would
contribute very small amounts of money to a health insurance pool.
</P>
<P>
   _ $700,000 to improve repro- ductive health among Kosovar
refugees, who are expected to give birth to 1,000 to 1,500 babies
per month.
</P>
<P>
   _ $365,000 to help the new director of the U.N. Development
Program, the U.N.'s primary agency dedicated to alleviation of
poverty, chart a new course.

STUDY FINDS TV TRIMS FIJIAN GIRLS' BODY IMAGE AND EATING HABITS

<P>
   ``You've gained weight,'' is a traditional compliment in Fiji,
anthropologists say.
</P>
<P>
   In accordance with traditional culture in the South Pacific
nation, dinner guests are expected to eat as much as possible. A
robust, nicely rounded body is the norm for men and women. ``Skinny
legs'' is a major insult. And ``going thin,'' the Fijian term for
losing a noticeable amount of weight, is considered a worrisome
condition.
</P>
<P>
   But all that may be changing, now that Heather Locklear has
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years after the introduction of television to a
province of Fiji's main island, Viti Levu, eating disorders _ once
virtually unheard of there _ are on the rise among girls, according
to a study presented Wednesday at the American Psychiatric
Association meetings in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Young girls dream of looking not like their mothers and aunts,
but like the wasp-waisted stars of ``Melrose Place'' and ``Beverly
Hills, 90210.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very heavy,'' one Fijian adolescent lamented during an
interview with researchers led by Anne E. Becker, director of
research at the Harvard Eating Disorders Center of Harvard Medical
School, who investigated shifts in body image and eating practices
in Fiji over a three-year period.
</P>
<P>
   The Fijian girl said that her friends also tell her that she is
too fat, ``and sometimes I'm depressed because I always want to
lose weight.''
</P>
<P>
   Epidemiological studies have shown that eating disorders are
more prevalent in industrialized countries, suggesting that
cultural factors play a role in setting off the conditions. But few
studies have examined the effects of long-term cultural shifts on
disordered eating in traditional societies.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Becker and her colleagues surveyed a group of 63 Fijian
secondary school girls, whose average age was 17. The work began in
1995, one month after satellites began beaming television signals
to the region.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the researchers surveyed another group of 65 girls from
the same schools, who were matched in age, weight and other
characteristics with the subjects in the earlier group.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen percent of the female students in the 1998 survey
reported that they had induced vomiting to control their weight,
the researchers said, in comparison with 3 percent in the 1995
survey. And 29 percent of the students scored highly on a test of
eating-disorder risk compared with 13 percent three years before.
</P>
<P>
   Girls who said they watched television three or more nights a
week in the 1998 survey were 50 percent more likely to describe
themselves as ``too big or fat'' and 30 percent more likely to diet
than girls who watched television less frequently, the researchers
found.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1995, Dr. Becker said, there was little talk of dieting
in Fiji. ``The idea of calories was very foreign to them.'' But in
the 1998 survey, 69 percent of the girls said they had been on a
diet at some point in their lives. In fact, preliminary data
suggest more teen-age girls in Fiji diet than their American
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the study have not been published, but were
reviewed by the psychiatric association's scientific program
committee before being accepted for presentation at the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the students told Dr. Becker and her colleagues that
they wanted to look like the Western women they saw on television
shows like ``Beverly Hills, 90210.'' One girl said that her friends
``change their mood, their hairstyles, so that they can be like
those characters.'' ``So in order to be like them, I have to work
on myself, exercising and my eating habits should change,'' she
continued.
</P>
<P>
   But Marshall Sahlins, Charles F. Grey professor emeritus of
anthropology at the University of Chicago, said that he doubts that
television was the only factor in the changes. ``I think that
television is a kind of metaphor of something more profound,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the solitary couch-potato viewing style displayed
by many Americans, watching television is a communal activity in
Fiji, Dr. Becker said. Fijians often gather in households with
television sets, and sit together, drinking kava and talking about
their day's activities, the TV on in the background.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we noticed in 1995 is that people had a sort of
curiosity, but it was a dismissive curiosity, like watching
something that seemed ridiculous,'' Dr. Becker said. ``But over the
years they have come to accept it as a form of entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiji residents have access to only one television channel, she
said, which broadcasts a selection of programs from the United
States, Britain and Australia. Among the most popular programs are
``Seinfeld,'' ``Melrose Place,'' which features Ms. Locklear,
``E.R.,'' ``Xena, Warrior Princess,'' and ``Beverly Hills, 90210.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Becker said that the increase in eating disorders like
bulimia may be a signal that the culture is changing so quickly
that Fijians are having difficulty keeping up. Island teen-agers,
she said, ``are acutely aware that the traditional culture doesn't
equip them well to negotiate the kinds of conflicts'' presented by
a 1990s global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional Fijian values stress communality over individual
achievement. But young Fijians know that they will need to get jobs
and earn money.
</P>
<P>
   In other Pacific societies, Dr. Becker said, similar cultural
shifts have been accompanied by an increase in psychological
problems among adolescents. Researchers speculated, for example,
that rapid social change played a role in a rash of adolescent
suicides in Micronesia in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whereas in America we understand eating disorders clinically
as an idiom of individual distress,'' she said, ``we might think of
this as a community idiom of distress.''

SERBIAN ARMY DESERTIONS RAISE NATO HOPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES RADIN AND COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ US and NATO officials said Wednesday that hundreds
of Serbian soldiers are deserting from the Yugoslav military in
Kosovo, raising the possibility that the two-month-long bombing
campaign is undermining discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Reports that 500 to 2,000 Yugoslav army reservists have deserted
in Kosovo have provided a badly needed boost for NATO, which has
come under attack for inflicting heavy, if accidental, casualties
on civilians. But other reports asserted that Yugoslav forces have
hunkered down along Kosovo's border with Macedonia, preparing for a
possible battle with NATO ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Wednesday that
the deserters returned to towns in central Serbia to defend
relatives from a government crackdown on antiwar protesters. He
said most were going to Krusevac, where Serbian police are
reportedly using ``extreme measures against demonstrators''
protesting forced army recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This...is further evidence that (Yugoslav President Slobodan)
Milosevic's regime is beginning to crack,'' Rubin said. ``Belgrade
is feeling the heat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have now demonstrations in three different towns where
he's having to divert troops to go and try to quell these internal
demonstrations. These are the mothers and parents you saw
demonstrating in support of Milosevic just weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, Serb officials said the soldiers in question were
reservists who returned to their homes after being withdrawn from
Kosovo last week.
</P>
<P>
   The reports of desertions took place as Russian and European
officials accelerated their efforts to find a diplomatic end to the
war in Kosovo. Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin traveled to
Belgrade Wednesday to hand-deliver the terms of a peace proposal.
While there were no reported breakthroughs Wednesday night,
Chernomyrdin's visit comes at a time when Serb authorities have
signaled that Milosevic is open to a deal.
</P>
<P>
   France, Italy and Germany said NATO's air campaign may be
bringing a change in Belgrade's position. ``Each day that goes by
see the chances of a settlement come closer,'' France's President
Jacques Chirac said at a French air force base outside Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always understood NATO's strategy to be a dual
strategy,'' said German Chancellor Gerard Schroeder. ``One element
is the military campaign ... to save people in Kosovo from being
killed, from being expelled. The second element of our strategy has
always been the search for a political settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy's Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema suggested sweetening the
deal by agreeing to Russian and Chinese demands that NATO pause its
bombing. At the same time, he assured that he wouldn't break with
the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   But US officials cautioned there will be no agreement until
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic capitulates to NATO's
demands. And key differences between Washington and Moscow over
NATO's role in the postwar Balkans could scuttle any peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   Those differences were underscored by Chernomyrdin's insistence,
in Belgrade, that NATO halt its bombing. ``To stop everything, for
Milosevic, for all of us, it is very important to add that once
more they should stop everything,'' Chernomydin said during his
one-day visit. ``Most important is that the bombing stops, stop
killing people.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin said there was agreement in Belgrade to work for
peace under the framework of a plan put forth by Russia and the
Group of Seven leading industrial nations.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, NATO bombs continued falling in Belgrade and
outside the capital. Tanjug, the Yugoslav government-controlled
news agency, said four people died when a factory was bombed in
Gnjilane, 25 miles southeast of Pristina, the Kosovo capital. Three
of the dead were women working in the factory cafeteria, Serb
officials said. The Serb Media Center said two inmates were killed
and several others injured when NATO bombed a prison in Istok in
northwest Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the bombing campaign to end the war has strained
the 19-nation alliance. Britain's renewed call for consideration of
ground troops in Kosovo set off an awkward public debate throughout
NATO over the introduction of troops.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, Italy and France _ who have been spearheading European
peace efforts _ publicly ruled out an invasion of Kosovo. President
Clinton, softening his opposition to a ground war, said Tuesday
that options remain on the table.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's Balkans envoy, Strobe Talbott,
appealed for unity in talks with the Group of Eight nations.
</P>
<P>
   The group is drafting the UN Security Council resolution that
would contain the elements of a peace settlement for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more accent there is on issues where we agree, the more
likely it is that one person who is not in on these meetings, Mr.
Milosevic, will get the right message,'' Talbott said.
</P>
<P>
   The G-8 plan calls for an immediate end to Serbia ethnic
cleansing campaign, the withdrawal of some 40,000 Yugoslav
soldiers, police and paramilitary groups, and the deployment of an
international peacekeeping force to oversee the return of nearly
800,000 ethnic Albanians to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   A transitional government, administered by the United Nations,
would be established to pave the way to a self-governing entity.
Any final agreement is also expected to demand that the Kosovo
Liberation Army end its offensive against Serbia and submit to
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   The State department sought to toughen its stance on Kosovo
Wednesday. David Scheffer, the US ambassador at large for war
crimes, said that a peace accord would not shield Milosevic or his
supporters from prosecution for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no deal to be cut,'' Scheffer said.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department source, speaking on condition of anonimity,
said a final peace agreement may deprive Milosevic of control over
Kosovo. ``We are looking at a (Western) protectorate for Kosovo''
in which Yugoslav forces would have even less control of border
crossings and customs than they would have had under the
Rambouillet agreement. Some sources say a reason no agreement to
avert the conflict was reached at the Rambouillet peace conference
earlier this year is that US negotiators refused to acknowledge
Serbia's sovereignty over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a deal can be struck, there remains considerable
opposition to the peace settlement from the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``The G-8 formula is a retreat by the international community,''
KLA spokesman Visar Rekar said. ``It would be a tragic error to
leave him room for maneuver by suspending air strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, China's UN ambassador, Qin Huasun, said that Beijing is
``adamant'' in opposing any diplomatic settlement. But US officials
remain hopeful that China will not stand in the way of an agreement
that can end the war.

   MILTON, England _ A visitor to the Psion plant here was
inquiring the other day about the competition facing the company,
which is best known in Britain for its palm-size organizers.
``Well,'' one top executive replied, `'there's a guy on the West
Coast of the U.S.A. ...''
</P>
<P>
   To American ears, that might have sounded like a coy reference
to 3Com Corp., based in California's Silicon Valley. 3Com makes the
Palm Pilot family of personal organizers, which soundly trounced
Psion's products in the United States, though Psion (pronounced
SY-on) claims 59 percent of the European market.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, Claes Bergstedt, the director of Psion's enterprise
computing division, was alluding to bigger prey _ and a different
line of business. By harnessing its Epoc operating system, the
basic software of its palm-top organizers, to the next generation
of wireless telephones, Psion PLC and the world's biggest mobile
phone producers are taking aim at no less a target than Microsoft
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft wants cell phones of the future to use a version of
its Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are huge because the winner of this race will control
the technology that cell phones and other high-speed wireless
devices use to connect people to their e-mail, online stock brokers
and myriad kinds of data on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, Psion signed a deal with Sweden's Ericsson and
Finland's Nokia mobile phone producers that Psion hopes will make
Epoc the de facto operating system standard for so-called smart
telephones and hand-held communicators in the next century. Earlier
this year, Motorola and NTT Docomo, the mobile phone unit of Nippon
Telegraph &AMP; Telephone, joined the deal, along with Sun
Microsystems, whose Java programming language also challenges
Microsoft. The resulting consortium, known as Symbian, will develop
a version of Epoc as a direct challenger to Windows CE, Microsoft's
pared-down version of its operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a market that's just developing, but it's a crucial
market,'' said Sean Faughnan, a technology analyst with J.P. Morgan
in London. ``Symbian looks like a very credible challenger.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Microsoft acknowledges Symbian's present lead. ``I would
say that yes, we are the underdog right now, which is not how many
people are used to thinking of Microsoft,'' said Robert O'Hara,
Microsoft's chief strategist on wireless technology. But, he added,
Microsoft was discussing a variety of other projects with the big
mobile-phone producers. ``So it's not like we are shut out and the
game is over.''
</P>
<P>
   By any standard, Psion is playing David to Microsoft's Goliath.
Its sales last year totaled $225 million compared with Microsoft's
$14.4 billion. Its employees number around 1,100, compared with
Microsoft's 30,000. Psion's modern factory in Milton, just south of
Oxford, which produces scanners, hand-held devices and business
computers, is easily dwarfed by Microsoft's 26-acre campus at
Redmond, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, its cash reserves are minuscule compared
with the $22 billion Microsoft has on hand, which it is dipping
into lavishly to buy into markets for its Windows CE software.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Psion has some marginal advantages in the cell phone
market, not least of which is a more tightly focused product.
Microsoft sees Windows CE as the key to dominating just about any
consumer device smaller than a computer. In addition to Internet
devices, this includes set-top boxes for cable television,
electronic organizers and even an emerging category of minuscule
notebook computers.
</P>
<P>
   Psion, in contrast, is focused solely on wireless Internet and
voice communications technology. To that end, the company reckons
it has an advantage. Its partners in Symbian control 80 percent of
wireless phone production worldwide and, with Ericsson and Nokia in
particular, it has tied itself to GSM, or global system for mobile
communications, a standard that gives consumers seamless
communications throughout most of Europe and onto South Africa and
parts of Asia. The U.S. market is fractured into multiple
standards, none strong enough to emerge as dominant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, you have the GSM guys really trying to control the
market,'' said Abhi Chaki, a telecommunications analyst at Jupiter
Communications in New York. ``And I think they'll be successful in
that because they have the standard, whereas in the United States
there are four or five technologies that exist like different
islands.''
</P>
<P>
   Symbian's emergence, of course, coincides with the remarkable
surge of acquisitions by Microsoft in European _ particularly
British _ cable and wireless communications companies.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, said Georges Nahon, the director of Microsoft's
European Internet unit in Paris, Microsoft is also looking for ways
into digital subscriber line technologies for offering high-speed
Internet access. Because DSL is a telephone-based service, it
offers even broader availability than cable does. Analysts say that
Microsoft's aim is clearly to control the consumer communication
chain through its Windows operating system and embedded Internet
Explorer browsing software, whether the link in question is a TV in
the living room or a wireless phone.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Microsoft invested $5 billion in AT&AMP;T and
its growing cable-based network, ensuring Windows a sizable chunk
of the set-top box market. It also has agreements to develop
wireless technology with Qualcomm in the United States and British
Telecom. Last week, Microsoft announced deals with Nextel
Communications Inc. in the United States and a Swedish start-up
called Sendit, a pioneer in enabling Internet access from mobile
phones.
</P>
<P>
   3Com, meanwhile, is taking a distinctly different path than
Psion or Microsoft by focusing on ways to enable its Palm Pilots to
communicate with any kind of phone. In fact, Joe Sipher, director
of 3Com's wireless products division, argues that the whole notion
of developing all-in-one wireless devices that combine the
functions of organizers, cell phones and Web browsers is
fundamentally flawed. While the new Palm VII will offer wireless
connections to the Internet, Sipher said it would not try to be all
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike Microsoft, we don't want our operating system running
set-top boxes or toasters,'' he said. ``And as for these
convergence products, they've been tried before and failed.
Customers keep saying they want one device that does everything,
but the truth is the attributes that make a great phone do not
necessarily make a great data device and vice versa.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I think a fundamental mistake that designers and
developers make is giving customers what they want instead of
giving them what they need.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Microsoft, Psion insists that the flurry of acquisitions
by its rival cannot poke a hole in the advantage Psion's Epoc
operating system enjoys in telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   First, said Psion spokesman Anthony Garvey, the tie-in with the
world's leading cell-phone producers means that Epoc, which the
company developed over the last 15 years, has a better-than-even
chance of becoming the de facto industry standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the year 2002, it's estimated there'll be 600 million users
of mobile phones and wireless-enabled devices'' for accessing and
browsing the Internet, he said. ``Eighty percent of those will be
made by Ericsson, Nokia or Motorola'' _ for which the company
stands to receive a license fee of $5 to $10 for every one that
runs Epoc.
</P>
<P>
   Second, through its alliance with Sun, the Symbian version of
Epoc will run Java-based software, making it compatible with a wide
and growing assortment of digital products, Garvey said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is not standing still, however. O'Hara said versions
of Windows CE in development will, like the Epoc system, work in
``real time'' _ that is, responding to a user's commands with no
delay. ``We think we are going to have a totally competitive
product,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Further more, Microsoft is seeking what he termed an
``end-to-end solution,'' meaning that the company intends to match
Internet services tightly to the device that happens to be using
them. For example, he said, Microsoft is developing a customized
version of its MSN Internet service for wireless phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough to provide a hand-set,'' he said. ``What the
information people want when they are mobile is quite a different
sort than when they are at home.''
</P>
<P>
   For all that, the Symbian deal could not have come at a better
time for Psion, whose sales of business-use hand-held computers,
palm-tops and data cards had been languishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psion computers had a difficult year in 1998, with changing
market conditions,'' said company chairman David Potter in March.
</P>
<P>
   And while there was no playing down the growing dominance of
3Com's Palm Pilots, Potter noted that ``the competitive threat from
Windows CE-based hand-held computers had diminished as those
products failed to establish a significant market presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Last June, Psion's stock was trading at around $3.20 in London.
When the Symbian deal was announced, it jumped to around $14.40. It
closed at $12,49 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement gave Psion a 31 percent stake in the alliance,
with 23 percent each to the other partners. But Psion also
inherited 31 percent of some $32 million in development costs. Last
year, Psion reported pretax profits of (PS)23.3 million, or $37.3
million at current exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   When all is said and done, many analysts give Symbian only a
50-50 chance of prevailing over Microsoft. Still, the race is on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much about being first in the market place,''
Bergstedt said. ``There's a huge potential to capture the
marketplace.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   KLERKSDORP, South Africa _ In a field of professional
politicians, Louis Luyt stands out. There isn't another fertilizer
magnate turned beer baron turned rugby czar in the running.
</P>
<P>
   His slogan is ``We Mean Business.'' An American pollster working
here calls him ``South Africa's Ross Perot,'' and the word from his
spokesman is: ``As he says, Exxon has four times the GDP of South
Africa, and if Exxon can be run like a business, this country
can.''
</P>
<P>
   But ask Luyt what voters see in him, and he says bluntly,
``They're looking for a man.''
</P>
<P>
   A man?
</P>
<P>
   ``A man who will stand up to adversity. A man who will stand up
for their rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Luyt (pronounced late) entered the race for a parliamentary seat
only seven months ago, but he was already a household name _ not
always uttered in admiration _ and doesn't shirk from spending
money.
</P>
<P>
   He drew only 120 listeners to the civic auditorium of this
farming city Tuesday night, but pollsters say he is close to the 1
percent of the national vote that would assure his new Federal
Alliance Party of seats in Parliament after the election June 2.
</P>
<P>
   The party has a full list of candidates _ most of them
conservative white defectors from the National Party _ but it is
clearly a one-man bandwagon. All its posters show only his face _
the gray hair and narrow, slightly suspicious eyes of a millionaire
executive, the remarkably thick neck of a former rugby lineman _
and the word ``Vote.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's subliminal,'' Luyt joked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking for a man'' may seem a fusty concept, especially
compared with the modern I-feel-your-pain ethos of American
politics, but to judge by the listeners arriving Tuesday night,
Luyt, 66, knows his audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a strong leader,'' said Ria van Wyk, a retired teacher.
``A good leader _ a go-get-'em type,'' said Henry de Korte, a
college student. ``Someone who could pull the country together,''
said D.P. Badenhorst, a retired farmer.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of the small crowd was black, as Luyt says 60 percent
of his supporters are _ which is surprising, considering that a
year ago, he was the embodiment of rugby's refusal to let the
government pressure it to put black players on the national team
before coaches judged them ready.
</P>
<P>
   The league forced Luyt to resign as its president because he
sued to stop a government inquiry into corruption and racism in the
sport and his lawyers forced President Nelson Mandela to spend two
humiliating days on the stand.
</P>
<P>
   But to blacks disappointed in the African National Congress
government, and particularly its failure to curb crime, Luyt has
some appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Africans, African men especially, like a man who is big and
strong, who has authority,'' said Nomavenda Mathiane, a black
reporter who watched Luyt campaign in black townships like Soweto
and Alexandra. ``They might not vote for Luyt, but they respect
him.''
</P>
<P>
   A black Klerksdorp resident, a 40-year-old storekeeper who
declined to give his name, saying he feared being attacked, came
because ``I read his manifesto _ fighting crime is his priority No.
1. My friends are disillusioned with the ANC, and most like Louis
Luyt.''
</P>
<P>
   On the issues, it is hard to describe Luyt's candidacy in
American terms because he calls himself a liberal. But he favors
chain gangs for criminals, the return of the death penalty, rapid
deportation of illegal immigrants, the establishment of a Christian
state, prayer in public schools and Parliament, an end to abortion
except in rape cases and merit hiring in preference to affirmative
action.
</P>
<P>
   Liberalism in South Africa is often about race; Luyt does not
defend apartheid and mocks the idea of a volkstaat, a separate
Afrikaner homeland. In 1988, seeking an end to the international
sports boycott, he defied the old apartheid government to meet the
African National Congress in exile and cut a deal to desegregate
rugby.
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts his business prowess. A former captain of the
Orange Free State rugby team with degrees in law and business, he
founded Triomf Fertilizers, which he said became one of the largest
fertilizer companies in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, he founded Louis Luyt Breweries and captured 16 percent
of the market in one year. Since 1986, he has turned the
debt-ridden Golden Lions rugby team and Ellis Park, a stadium in
Johannesburg, into a franchise richer than all the country's other
teams combined _ an accomplishment that has endowed him with a
higher cash-to-humility ratio than George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about reports that he had spent 2 million rand of his own
on the race _ about $300,000 _ he scoffed. ``I spent 3 million last
week.'' He declined to name the total; ``my bank manager would kill
me.''
</P>
<P>
   He turned snide on being told a popular political analyst had
estimated he would spend $6 a vote to get 50,000 votes (``the
average rugby crowd,'' the analyst had cattily noted). He was
spending far more than ``that failed journalist turned political
analyst'' knew, he said, and would win 20 of the 400 seats in
Parliament _ a bold prediction, since polls he dismisses suggest he
might get four.
</P>
<P>
   Though sometimes bombastic for TV cameras, he is no
rabble-rouser. His subdued speech here was almost wistful for
``this beautiful land of ours'' that he said had been turned over
to majority rule too precipitously and was being mismanaged; five
more years of ANC government, he said, ``and you'll be sitting in
poverty wondering what might have been.''
</P>
<P>
   The applause was polite. At the end, he almost begged for
questions; no one had any.
</P>
<P>
   When Luyt declared his candidacy in October, he hoped to unite
all the opposition parties against the African National Congress,
which is expected to win the election handily. That union never
happened. But he doesn't regret the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike an endless American campaign, ``it hasn't been
miserable,'' he said. ``It's been expensive! But not miserable.''

MANDELA DEPUTY TRIES TO ALLAY FEARS OF ANC POWER 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ The African National Congress has
no plans to change the constitution if it wins a two-thirds
majority in the election on June 2, according to Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties have used the ANC's goal of a two-thirds
majority to try to mobilize voters against President Nelson
Mandela's party, saying a landslide victory would give it far too
much power.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the party has sent vague and contradictory signals
about what it would do with a two-thirds majority. Speaking to a
business seminar Tuesday, Mbeki was clearly trying to allay
concerns over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki said ``there is no substance'' to suggestions that the ANC
would try to curtail the power of provincial governments or rein in
independent watchdog agencies. He said his party was simply looking
for the ``biggest support possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls have suggested the ANC, which got almost 62 percent
of the vote in 1994, could get 67 percent this time, particularly
if there is a low voter turnout.

 &HT;    Lockheed Martin may cash in on part of proposed defense contract
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lockheed Martin's Marietta plant would build four
C-130J cargo planes under a defense spending proposal approved
Wednesday by the House Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The defense contract, valued at an estimated $252 million,
doubles the number of the planes approved by the Senate Armed
Services Committee last week.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal passed the committee 55-1, with the only dissenting
vote coming from Rep. Cynthia McKinney (D-Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   The contract is part of a sweeping budget request from the
Defense Department to spend $288.8 billion in the coming fiscal
year. That is an increase of $10 billion over what the department
was given this year.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the difference in funding for the C-130, the House
and Senate bills closely mirror each other. Both call for spending
at least $161 million on construction projects at military bases in
Georgia. Both also would spend $3 billion to build six F-22
fighters. The Lockheed Martin plant in Marietta is the assembly
point for the F-22.
</P>
<P>
   The driving force behind this year's spending increase is the
``vital need to improve our military preparedness,'' said Rep.
Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), a member of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere was the need more evident than in NATO's war against
Yugoslavia, Chambliss said. Years of declining military budgets
reduced the nation's military resources to a dangerously low level,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The $15 billion emergency spending bill that passed the House
earlier this week will help, Chambliss said, but Congress should be
spending more in its regular budget to bolster the nation's
defense, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make sure our tanks and equipment are in tip top
shape,'' Chambliss said. ``We have got to be prepared for two major
theater wars to occur at any given time. I don't think this goes
far enough toward that goal, but it moves us in the right
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to bring the military up to par, the Joint Chiefs of
Staff requested $32 billion in additional funds, Chambliss said.
This year's spending plan falls $16 billion short of that goal.
</P>
<P>
   The C-130J is an advanced version of a cargo plane that Lockheed
has been building for three decades. The aircraft is used by the
Air Force and the Marine Corps. This budget request would be for
the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best advertisement for the C-130s is CNN,'' said
Chambliss, noting how the planes are constantly seen in the
network's coverage of the war in Yugoslavia. ``It's the workhorse
of this war.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), whose district produces the C-130, said
he will work to make sure that the four aircraft ``remain in the
defense budget as it moves through the legislative process.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin is cautiously optimistic about the prospect. The
company has said that it would need 12 C-130s to maintain
production at its Marietta plant in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are encouraged by what we have seen so far, but there is a
long way to go,'' said Peter Simmons, spokesperson at Lockheed
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin is not the only Georgia winner in this year's
defense spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   The bill calls for spending $3.6 billion on 15 C-17 planes,
which are assembled at the Boeing Company plant in Macon. And the
bill calls for $483 million in funding for a Joint Surveillance
Targeting Attack Radar System aircraft, which is based at the
Warner Robins Air Logistics Center. The bill allocates $46 million
in additional funds to go toward the purchase of another plane.

THE PROBLEMS WITH PROVING PREDATORY PRICING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Colo., Mo., Texas, Kan., N.J., Ill.)  By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Justice Department's antitrust suit against American
Airlines accusing it of predatory pricing behavior is easy to mock.
</P>
<P>
   Predation _ by which a dominant company takes unprofitable
actions such as cutting prices below costs to drive competitors out
of business, then raises prices to recover earlier losses _ rarely
occurs. Historians debate whether predation has occurred more than
a handful of times over the last 100 years. Even when it does
occur, it can be nearly impossible to prove.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, says Prof. Robert Willig of Princeton University, it would
be premature to dismiss the potential importance of the government
suit. Though a consultant on predation issues to airlines in recent
years, Willig nonetheless calls the complaint ``courageous and
sophisticated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes smarter economic arguments than plaintiffs have made
in the past, bringing the government's philosophy of predation
closer in line with the sound economics,'' he said. Willig remains
agnostic about the merits of the case because ``beyond coherent
arguments, there must also be hard evidence. We haven't seen any
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Upstart carriers are vulnerable to predatory behavior because an
incumbent airline like American can flood markets with low-cost
service merely by switching planes from one route to another. That
is precisely what the government contends American did to Vanguard
Airlines, Sun Jet and Western Pacific flying from the Dallas-Fort
Worth area to Wichita, Kan.; Kansas City, Mo.; Long Beach, Calif.;
and Colorado Springs, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   In these cases, the complaint says, American drastically cut
fares and added many flights to routes when the upstart began
operations. Later, after the upstart's business shriveled or
disappeared, American reversed course, cutting service and raising
prices. The government says it will prove predatory intent by
showing that the extra revenue generated by America's extra flights
failed to cover the extra costs. American denies the contention.
</P>
<P>
   Willig points to a novel part of the government's case. It will
argue that American incurs a cost, beyond operating expenses, of
using airplanes it already owns to add flights to Wichita and the
other cities. Those planes could have been used somewhere else, so
the revenue lost by not flying more profitable routes should be
treated as a cost of expanding service to Wichita. The courts have
not yet embraced this way of calculating costs even though it
conforms to standard economic analysis.
</P>
<P>
   However, enlightened some of its arguments, the government's
case is also riddled with problems.
</P>
<P>
   Start with its focus on American's yo-yo price-setting and
scheduling in the face of entry and exit by upstarts. That could
reflect predation. But it could also reflect simple competition.
Incumbent airlines are allowed to cut fares to match competitors
and sell extra seats as consumers respond to the price cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The government's contention that American sacrificed profits by
cutting its fares and expanding services to Wichita and the other
cities will be hard to prove. Attributing specific costs to
specific routes is arbitrary where some costs go to general
overhead. Economists generally argue that the government must prove
a ``but for'' argument _ proving that American's price cutting and
flight increases would make no financial sense but for their role
in driving rivals out of business.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the government needs to prove that the low fares
and extra flights would prove financially ruinous if continued
indefinitely. To make the argument stick, the government will have
to prove that American could reasonably expect to recover its
losses after Vanguard or Sun Jet exits the market by raising fares
_ confident that its high fares would not attract another round of
upstarts.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis W. Carlton, an economist at the University of Chicago,
points to other problems with the government's case. He helped
prepare a report by Lexecon, a consulting firm in Chicago, on
behalf of United Airlines that called into question the
government's contention that predation is a big problem. The data
show, he says, ``that upstarts are about as successful in
establishing new routes as are the major carriers.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlton pokes a more profound hole in the government's case. On
many lightly traveled routes, there is room for only one carrier.
When an upstart takes on an incumbent, they are likely to engage in
a price war until only one survives. In this situation, Carlton
asks, ``Does it make sense for the government to tie the hands of
one the competitors _ and not necessarily those of the low-cost
competitor?''
</P>
<P>
   But even if Carlton is right that predation is not a problem for
the airline industry in general, it does not mean that American did
not engage in predation at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport. To make
that judgment requires examining the government's data, which it
has not released. Based on the past, the odds are not stacked in
Justice's favor. But at least it has issued a complaint that gives
American fair warning that the level of sophistication that it will
bring to the court room will far exceed anything seen in the past.

HOOKING KIDS INTO FISHING
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CASTAIC, Calif. _ Call me a sucker for kids with fishing poles,
but there is something entirely magical about those beaming faces
when a flip-flopping trout is brought in at line's end.
</P>
<P>
   As a father whose son is too young yet to participate, I can
only watch and admire in hopes that someday he will be as entranced
as the youngsters I saw fishing during Saturday's trout derby at
Castaic Lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   Those wide eyes may speak volumes, but it's those mouths that
utter some real gems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt slimy. I caught him in my net,'' said 6-year-old
Hannah Nespral of Canyon Country after landing her very first fish.
``He's tired. He needs to take a nap.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, 4-year-old Valencia angler Taylor Tilston had just
reeled in his inaugural catch. ``It felt good. I thought I'd never
catched one,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   His 2-year-old brother, Trevor, had also reeled in his first
fish, but was clutching his father's leg and sobbing at the thought
his trout would somehow wriggle off the stringer. Dad's promise
that he wouldn't let it swim away wasn't much consolation.
</P>
<P>
   Erica Leary, 14, of Valencia, was on hand to catch rays, not
fish, and oversee her two younger brothers. While she enjoys
angling from a boat, bank-fishing is too slow for her. But she
noted that there's nothing quite like observing children fish:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice when you see their faces when they try to pick up
the fishes and they slide out of their hands and sometimes the fish
whacks them. That's the best part.''
</P>
<P>
   Other answers to the question ``What's the best part about
fishing?'' are often predictably similar from many shy kids:
``Catching fish.'' One can expect the usual, ``It's fun,'' ``Eating
the fish,'' ``I dunno'' or nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, responses can be more revealing, like that of
10-year-old Ryan Whelchel of Newhall, who said, ``Gutting it.'' It
matters little how eloquent children express themselves; they'll
always cherish the experience.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take much to get children started in fishing. As
recommended by Hooked on Fishing International _ which established
a nationwide kids fishing derby program and estimates nearly 800
youth fishing contests will be held throughout the nation this year
_ there are a few simple guidelines. Start a child with tackle
properly sized to the child's stature and skill level, said Gordon
Holland, co-founder of Hooked On Fishing International.
</P>
<P>
   ``A small youngster needs small tackle,'' Holland explained in a
recent release. ``Consider a very short rod, trying to match the
rod length with the child's height. Also, be sure the reel is small
and very light so as to fit comfortably into a child's small hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Proper tackle makes for a more enjoyable fishing experience _
making for a lifetime fishing partner.''
</P>
<P>
   If you ever lose sight of how fun fishing can be or if your
competitive nature gets in the way of having a good time, spend a
morning at a kid's trout derby; you'll get grounded again real
quick. Saturday's derby drew more than 400 anglers ages 15 and
younger. It was part of a larger charitable event known as Bassing
for Abused Kids, which includes a bass-fishing team tournament (see
results in Outpost) and raises money for organizations that assist
abused, abandoned and neglected children in Southern California and
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh annual project collected $38,000 for its
beneficiaries _ Santa Clarita's First Nurturing Touch and Royal
Family Kids Camp of Costa Mesa _ and eclipsed the previous record
of $22,000 established in 1996. Since its inception in 1993,
Bassing for Abused Kids Inc. _ the charity's umbrella agency _ has
raised more than $132,000 through the generosity of sponsors, bass
anglers, raffle-ticket buyers and other contributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something to help somebody else out and have a better
life,'' said Char Arial, whose daughters Sarah, 6, and Angela, 10,
had landed three trout by 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is something very gratifying about a kids fishing
event that aids other kids.

PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES FOCUS ON LITTLETON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo.)   (See also Congress-Guns)  (DW) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The school shootings in Colorado are so dominating
presidential politics that Dan Quayle took the occasion of the
seventh anniversary of his ``Murphy Brown'' speech Wednesday to
deplore the polluted culture he said had contributed to the
shootings. In the process, Quayle, a Republican candidate for
president, played down the role of guns in the Littleton killings
and emphasized personal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overriding issue isn't really gun control, it's
self-control,'' Quayle declared in his speech, delivered in the
same San Francisco arena as his previous excoriation of Murphy
Brown, the television character who had a child out of wedlock. ``A
child who loves God, honors his parents and respects his neighbors
will not kill anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   A month after the worst school killings in the nation's history,
virtually all of the presidential candidates are incorporating the
shootings into their campaign speeches and shaping their public
events around the episode to help define their candidacies. For
many it has emerged as a chance to reflect on the state of American
society, its culture and its values.
</P>
<P>
   One candidate, Elizabeth Dole, has taken perhaps the most
dramatic tack, using the shootings to espouse an eye-catching
platform of gun control and to promote herself squarely with women
who vote.
</P>
<P>
   More typically, Quayle, the former vice president, has focused
his attention on the culture; Wednesday he blamed a liberal ``legal
aristocracy'' for judicial opinions that he said undermined
society.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who has spoken out repeatedly about the
killings since the incident on April 20, is to travel to Littleton
on Thursday to meet privately with the families of the victims and
to address the city. Gary Bauer, another Republican candidate for
president, plans a similar visit on Thursday to speak at a
Christian school in nearby Denver.
</P>
<P>
   One reason politicians are so focused on Littleton is the
public's continuing preoccupation with it. A new survey from the
Pew Research Center says that interest in Littleton among Americans
remains so high _ six in 10 are still paying very close attention
to it _ that ``the follow-up reports continue to rank among the top
news stories of the decade.'' Almost twice as many people are
absorbed in news about Littleton than are following the NATO
bombings in Yugoslavia, the poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster, explained the preoccupation
this way: ``The problems of violence and discipline in schools have
been a preoccupation of the American public for a considerable
period of time, but those concerns have been inchoate, dispersed
and individualized. What Littleton serves to do is make it
concrete, give it specificity to make it real for people, and it
creates an imperative to act.''

EXPECT CHALLENGES IN SANTA ANITA CANYON
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ Twenty-five miles east of one of the world's
busiest intersections lies access to a mountain chain that can
resemble Colorado, with a little Pacific Northwest thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   Interlaced with hundreds of miles of trails and dirt roads, the
San Gabriel Mountains are a far cry from the San Fernando Valley
junction of the 101 and 405 freeways and a critical out for
Southland adventurers.
</P>
<P>
   Streams run year-round, and the higher elevations are laden with
snow each winter. Yet even in the lofty rugged peaks of the Angeles
National Forest, the summer heat _ and the air quality _ can become
oppressive. That leaves a precious few weeks between April and July
when the weather is neither too cold nor too hot to enjoy this
verdant backcountry getaway.
</P>
<P>
   One of the trailheads for mountain biking that is simplest to
reach is found at Chantry Flat Picnic Area above Arcadia. But
beware, access to the Upper Winter Creek Trail is about the only
thing that's easy about this route, which is described herein as a
9{-mile loop that also combines Zion, Sturtevant and Upper Falls
trails and winds through bucolic Santa Anita Canyon. An optional
6-mile out-and-back ride to Mount Wilson can be found, as well.
</P>
<P>
   These trails are not for the faint of heart or weak of leg. Not
only are they extremely narrow with severe exposure and rocky
granite outcroppings, many switch back sharply and can climb as
much as a thousand feet in a mile _ a standard to gauge extreme
steepness.
</P>
<P>
   Also be aware that the locals don't take too kindly to
irresponsible riders. There is a well-staffed volunteer mountain
bike patrol that will just as soon report your inconsiderate
behavior as save you from being lost or injured. But if you think
you can handle it, you will be treated to some of the most
exquisite singletrack in all of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been running and riding these trails for 15 years,'' said
volunteer patroller Laurence Johann of Sierra Madre. ``I feel like
I'm closer to God every time I come up here.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the most skilled and fit riders need attempt the route; all
trails noted are moderate to difficult, with some technical
sections. Other seasonable hardships can come into play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only does it get unbearably hot in the summer, there's the
rattlesnakes to contend with,'' said Long Beach patroller Guy
Hutton.
</P>
<P>
   From the picnic area parking lot at an elevation of 2,200 feet,
make your way up to the ranger facility and turn to the left of the
building past a large yellow gate marked ``Upper Winter Creek
Trail, 2N41.''
</P>
<P>
   Ride up the paved road for three-tenths of a mile to a trail on
the right that is flagged ``Upper Winter Creek Trail, Hoegee's Camp
2.5 miles, Mt. Wilson 6.5 miles.'' The trail climbs gradually, and
at 2.2 miles in begins descending more steeply, including some
tight, steep switchbacks. Within another four-tenths of a mile a Y
intersection is reached (2,625 feet); turn right. (The left fork
meanders up to Mount Wilson in some 6 miles, however it is
extremely steep and technical and not recommended; a shorter side
trip lies ahead.)
</P>
<P>
   Pedal on and soon ford Winter Creek, turning right after
crossing it to the next trail junction at the 2.7-mile mark. Our
course veers to the left onto the Zion Trail. (Staying to the right
takes riders to Hoegee's Camp and down Lower Winter Creek Trail
through several stream crossings to Chantry Flat; round-trip
distance for this loop option is about 5 miles.)
</P>
<P>
   The Zion Trail climbs steeply and gains 1,000 feet in 1.4 miles
to a junction with a short trail that traverses to the right a
short distance to the summit of 3,575-foot Mount Zion. Push on past
the juncture and descend a lush, fern-festooned trail dotted with
poison oak. The mile-long drop is narrow and exposed, so exercise
caution. At 5.2 miles in cyclists reach a T that is the Sturtevant
Trail (3,275 feet), near a spot known as Camp Sturtevant.
</P>
<P>
   Aggressive cyclists can turn left and ascend a difficult 3-mile
segment, which gains feet before reaching 5,710-foot Mount Wilson.
We turn right toward Sturtevant Falls.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 yards down the trail, turn left over a slight cascade
then up and over a small saddle. Continue past the Gabrielino Trail
that comes in from the left at a spot identified by a sign that
states, ``Chantry Flat 4 miles.'' Turning right, you will pass
through a series of picnic areas. Remain to the right of the stream
and, at 6{ miles in, take Upper Falls Trail (2,450 feet), which
rises from the canyon bottom, once again becoming rocky and
technical. At mile 8, the track drops steeply and again joins
Sturtevant Trail at the base of Santa Anita Canyon (2,050 feet). To
the left is renowned Sturtevant Falls; steer right onto the final
1{-mile section returning to Chantry Flat, and watch out for
hikers.
</P>
<P>
   At mile 9, Lower Winter Creek Trail runs in from the right
(1,800 feet); continue ahead over a bridge and climb the 400 feet
up a paved road back to your automobile. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
IF YOU'RE GOING...
</P>
<P>
   Chantry Flat Picnic Area and the outset of Upper Winter Creek
Trail are situated above Arcadia in the Angeles National Forest.
Drive east on the Ventura Freeway (134) to the Foothill Freeway
(210) east, exit at Santa Anita Avenue and turn left. The route
turns into Santa Anita Canyon Road as it ascends into the San
Gabriel Mountains. Parking is limited at the picnic area, so cars
may be left along the roadside.
</P>
<P>
   Be prepared to pay $5 for a one-day Adventure Pass, as required
by the U.S. Forest Service. Passes can be purchased _ on weekends
only _ at the site, or at nearby sporting goods stores. Some hearty
souls choose to park on residential streets and pedal the steep
3-mile stretch to the trailhead, which saves $5 but increases the
workout.
</P>
<P>
   Allow at least two hours to complete the 9{-mile loop, and
another hour or more if the 6-mile round-trip extension to Mount
Wilson is tackled.
</P>
<P>

Harrison Cartography's ``Trail Map of the Angeles Front Country.''
Some maps are available at Chantry Flat.

WHO SHOULD BE MANAGING OUR WILDLIFE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH LAIR  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN GABRIEL, Calif. _ When the harbor seal population began to
diminish, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service made it illegal to
hunt, touch or hurt the marine mammals.
</P>
<P>
   This is one example of how government agencies and conservation
groups became involved in wildlife issues. Their participation,
however, has not been without controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Is it the job of DFG director Robert Hight and the Fish and Game
Commission _ all appointed by the state governor, who is elected by
the people _ to determine what is best for the state's wildlife? Or
is it the job of organizations to determine that policy?
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely oppose specialty groups getting involved in
wildlife management,'' said Ed Hover, the California conservation
director for the Izaak Walton League. ``That should be in control
of the Department of Fish and Game. What these groups do is a lot
of (political) lobbying. They're thinking of Bambi, dealing with
sentiment.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Mountain Lion Foundation executive Lynn
Sadler said it isn't fair for the DFG to run roughshod over these
organizations. Instead, the state should look at other methods of
solving problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just about what to do with mountain lions, beavers or
gnatcatchers,'' she said. ``We're saying that they should try to
find other ways to do things. The agencies are not following the
public's wishes. They've been like a bunch of kids that want their
way. All we're saying is there are different ways to handle things
and a lot of interpretations.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislation protecting endangered species has had significant
statewide impact:
</P>
<P>
   _Anglers now curse at harbor seals for stealing their catch as
they reel in the fish. San Diego officials have had to resort to
roping off a portion of the city's popular Children's Pool beach at
La Jolla to protect the seals from people. Many boaters and anglers
up and down the West Coast consider the animals a menace.
</P>
<P>
   _Since the mountain lion initiative was first passed in 1992,
hunters claim it has ruined the state's deer population, resulting
in fewer in-state hunting license purchases and less funds to
support California's wildlife. There also have been increased
reports of mountain lions attacking humans throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   _After traps were made illegal in November's election, two
coyotes attacked a San Jose-area hiker. Biologists note the only
way to remove the animals safely is through traps; no other method
will work effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that specialty groups want to protect one
species _ and sometimes that means at the expense of others, while
other times that group's efforts provide a side benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each group is beneficial,'' said Patti Krueger, a biologist
for the Angeles National Forest. ``A group like Quail Unlimited may
be interested in protecting and improving the habitat of quails,
and their work benefits all other species.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with specialty groups that focus on one animal is
that they may focus on the problems of that animal and overlook the
overall picture,'' Krueger said. ``There are extremists
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Hover is unhappy with the harbor seals decree, stating the
animals have all but wiped out the Pismo clam population. ``They're
scavengers,'' he said. ``They overeat and ruin pristine areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone shares his view.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seals have rights, too,'' Dorene Carlson told one
newspaper about the seals occupying La Jolla beaches. ``By leaving
them alone, we're teaching our children to respect other
creatures.''
</P>
<P>
   Krueger believes at the heart of the debate is the management
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is, who is managing the (mountain lion) herd?'' she
said. ``The Department of Fish and Game feels by hunting it can
manage the herd and they feel they can do that without a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   When wildlife begins preying on humans and pets, wildlife
management could be in trouble, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``When an animal is consistently in backyards and not utilizing
its habitat, that means it is being pushed into urban areas,''
Krueger said. ``If an animal is completely protected, then you're
lacking the ability to look at the big picture. Wildlife is then
being influenced by people.''
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't for controls, the bald eagle and the gray whale
would not have rebounded from the endangered lists, and the
mountain lion and harbor seal might have replaced the eagle and
whale on those lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is,'' Sadler said, ``do we have a Mountain Lion
Foundation to protect only mountain lions, or do we follow our
mission statement to protect all California wildlife, with the
mountain lion as a point of reference from which we look at the
entire (eco)system?''

TWO POSSIBLE CANDIDATES WON'T RUN FOR MEXICAN PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Two influential governing party politicians
Wednesday ended weeks of mystery about their presidential
aspirations, declining to compete for the party's nomination
against Interior Minister Francisco Labastida Ochoa, who is said to
be President Ernesto Zedillo's choice.
</P>
<P>
   The two politicians' parallel decisions appeared to strengthen
the possibilities for Labastida, who announced on Tuesday that he
would resign to seek the governing party's nomination, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two men who announced Wednesday that they would not run were
Miguel Aleman Velasco, the governor of Veracruz, and Esteban
Moctezuma Barragan, the Social Development minister.
</P>
<P>
   Their simultaneous withdrawal added to the sensation that
Zedillo and his advisers have written a script casting Labastida as
the leading man for the nomination of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, even though the party will
select its candidate for the first time through a presidential
primary, instead of allowing the president to select the candidate
directly, as has been traditional.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida has recently attracted the backing of several PRI
governors, pro-PRI business executives and leaders of
PRI-controlled labor federations.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawals by Aleman and Moctezuma leave Labastida facing
only two significant rival candidates, Gov. Roberto Madrazo Pintado
of Tabasco and Manuel Bartlett, the ex-governor of Puebla. And
since Madrazo and Bartlett both draw their backing from the same
constituency of PRI traditionalists, they are likely to compete
mainly with each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labastida benefits from the decisions by Aleman and
Moctezuma,'' said Alfonso Zarate Flores, the publisher of a
political newsletter here. ``This is part of a preconceived plan
I'd call political engineering. There's nothing spontaneous about
these events.''
</P>
<P>
   Aleman, whose father of the same name was president of Mexico
during the country's 1946-52 postwar boom, had run strongly in
recent opinion polls, solely on the basis of his legendary name.
Wednesday he said he wanted to stay on as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Moctezuma began his career in 1987 as an aide to Labastida, then
the governor of Sinaloa state. Referring to his former boss,
Moctezuma said Wednesday, ``I see the party already has someone who
represents the values I stand for.''

 &HT;    Folks like Williams put the Republican Party on map
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Marguerite Williams could be a handful, as more than
one Republican state chairman found out.
</P>
<P>
   So did Pat Robertson when he ventured onto the floor of the 1988
Republican National Convention on a peacekeeping mission to the
Georgia delegation and ran head-on into Williams, who gave him a
piece of her mind about the squabbles then going on between his
supporters and her candidate, George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Disaffected by that tumultuous intraparty battle, Williams in
later years gave money to Democrats Sam Nunn and Zell Miller _
heresy, in the eyes of some, for a former Republican national
committeewoman.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Williams, who died last week, deserves to be
remembered when the Republicans gather in Augusta this weekend for
their state convention.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the party's presidential candidates are slated to speak
to the Georgians this weekend _ not to mention NRA Executive Vice
President Wayne LaPierre, who'll be introduced by U.S. Rep. Bob
Barr.
</P>
<P>
   After they've sized up Lamar Alexander, Gary Bauer, Elizabeth
Dole and Alan Keyes, many of the Republicans will zip back to
Atlanta for Texas Gov. George W. Bush's presidential kickoff,
attended by the elder Bushes, George and Barbara, standing in for
their son.
</P>
<P>
   It is a relatively recent phenomenon for the Georgia Republican
Party to get this much national attention, and it wouldn't have
been possible without the presence, during the lean years, of a few
strong-willed, sometimes cantankerous people with checkbooks, like
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a venture capitalist for the Republican Party early
on, when there weren't a lot of people willing to write checks,''
said Rusty Paul, who's bowing out as state chairman this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Political generosity is not a natural trait of the well-to-do. A
lot of rich people make contributions because they feel they have
to, or on a whim.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many worthy causes, and many poster children more
appealing than politicians. Relatively few of the wealthy get
involved as much as Williams _ certainly not on such a long shot as
the Georgia Republican Party used to be.
</P>
<P>
   An heiress to the Maybelline cosmetic fortune, she was one of
the Thomasville Republicans, a small group, many with northern
connections, who formed one of the nodal points around which the
modern party has bloomed.
</P>
<P>
   The party has worked hard in the past few years to broaden its
base of contributors, from about 4,000 to 44,000, Paul said, and is
today much less dependent on a few key donors than it once was.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that 90 percent of the money to run the party came
from 10 percent of the contributors, he said. Now it's more like 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Which isn't to say a handful of the party's biggest contributors
aren't ``crucial at crucial times,'' as the chairman put it.
</P>
<P>
   More so for the Republicans. There are two sorts of currency in
politics: the kind that comes with being elected and appointing
people to boards and deciding where economic projects will be
located, and the more traditional variety provided by those with
the means and will to write checks.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Georgia Republicans accumulate more of the first kind
of currency, they will remain dependent on the latter.

 &HT;    Ebenezer Baptist restoration ensured
 &HT;    By Jennifer Ffrench-Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The money is now in the bank and the historic Ebenezer
Baptist Church is about to undergo a major overhaul that will
preserve it as part of Atlanta's civil rights legacy.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Park Service, which operates the 86-year-old building
that was home to the church that nurtured the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr., received grants totalling $1.2 million Wednesday to
continue the building's restoration.
</P>
<P>
   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton announced a $620,398 grant
from the federal government's Save America's Treasures Program. The
Ebenezer restoration was one of 62 projects in 24 states that got
grants totalling $30 million. The National Parks Foundation, a
nonprofit group that raises funds for park service projects, will
match that grant.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Catroppa, superintendent of the Martin Luther King Jr.
National Historic Site, said the money will cover all the work
needed to preserve the building.
</P>
<P>
   Planning for the restoration, which will take about a year, will
begin by next week. The work will be done over two years. It will
preserve the interior and exterior of the building and its
furnishings and artifacts, and replace the building's electrical,
heating and air conditioning systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have a contractor on the site by April or May next
year,'' Catroppa said.
</P>
<P>
   Since assuming control of the building with a 99-year lease in
March, Catroppa said the Park Service has spent $153,000 to replace
a leaky roof. It is now well into a $35,000 restoration of the bell
tower, which is scheduled for completion by early June.
</P>
<P>
   Catroppa said the church will close to tours during some of the
work next year. ``There will be no way to avoid it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ebenezer's congregation vacated the 750-seat sanctuary for its
new $8 million Horizon Sanctuary in March.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1886, Ebenezer was the home church of the young King,
whose father was pastor from 1931 to 1975. King was co-pastor with
his father from 1960 to 1968. His funeral was held there after his
1968 assassination, and he is interred next door at the King
Center.

this time, the allegedly guilty party is a Fortune 500 company. The
first few suits filed under Washington state's pioneering anti-spam

couldn't be served with the suit or so impecunious that it was
questionable whether it was worth it. This time the company is easy

   GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala _ Lucrecia Vasquez wavers from one day
to the next about whether her brother is dead or alive.
</P>
<P>
   The last time she saw him was in April 1984, a few months before
he was to finish medical school. The phone rang, she recalled, and
a moment later Omar Dario Vasquez rushed out the door. He yelled
something about a medical emergency and said he would be back soon.
</P>
<P>
   But, Omar Vasquez, then 23, was never seen again. And this week,
his sister received what may be the first real evidence about his
fate. A document that human rights officials said was taken from
secret Guatemalan military files explains that Vasquez was
``captured on 7th Avenue, in front of the Hotel Dorado Americana''
in Guatemala City. Nine days later, on May 6, the document said,
Vasquez was killed. His death, human rights investigators said, is
noted on the document in military code: ``06-05-84: 300.''
</P>
<P>
   The document was scheduled to be released Thursday by the
National Security Archives, the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, the Washington Office on Latin America and
Human Rights Watch. Investigators of these agencies, who have been
studying the document for two months, said they have concluded it
describes the activities of a secret Guatemalan military unit that
kidnapped, tortured, and executed Guatemalan men and women during
the early 1980s as part of a violent army campaign against leftists
suspected of subversion in Guatemala City.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths and disappearances occurred while Guatemala, a
country of 11 million people, was being ravaged by civil war
between a right-wing military government, supported by the United
States, and leftist guerrillas. The civil war, which ended three
years ago, was the longest and bloodiest in Central American
history. Some 200,000 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates in Guatemala and the United States said
the new document _ a log book of detainees that came bound in a
tattered spiral binder _is the most detailed document about
military abuses ever obtained from Guatemalan army sources. Human
rights investigators who were members of an independent truth
commission, formally known as the Historical Clarification
Commission, had unsuccessfully appealed to the Guatemalan military
for these kinds of documents during its 16-month investigation of
human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials who reviewed the document said that while
it could be a genuine military intelligence document, it is not
something that could be found in the military's official archives.
Human rights officials disagree, saying that the document proves
that more like it must exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is about the best evidence we have ever gotten about the
cold-blooded, deliberate, calculated strategy that the military
used to pick people up one by one,'' said Kate Doyle, a Guatemala
expert for the National Security Archives who led an investigation
of the document. ``There must be more documents like this. And now
we can press harder for the Guatemalan government to release
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Doyle refused to reveal the source of the document, and she
would only say that human rights agencies purchased it for $2,000
from a former ``low-ranking'' military officer. Although almost all
of the document is typed in dry shorthand, with no signatures or
military seals, the human rights investigators said they are
confident it is genuine.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of those listed in the log book had been reported missing
in human rights records and press accounts from the period, Ms.
Doyle said, and the dates and detention details about many
prisoners in the log book also match human rights reports from the
period.
</P>
<P>
   After briefly reviewing the document, government officials in
Guatemala said they could not dispute that claim without conducting
their own investigation. A spokesman for Guatemalan President
Alvaro Arzu Irigoyen suggested that the document be turned over to
Guatemalan courts that have been established to investigate charges
of abuse by the military.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the government had never tried to keep documents
about military abuses hidden. But, he said that such documents are
not a part of the official military archive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not say that these kind of documents do not exist,''
he said. ``But they would not be found in an official military
archive. It is unfair to accuse the government of trying to hide
documents that it does not control.''
</P>
<P>
   Former members of the Historical Clarification Commission said
the document confirmed their suspicions that the Guatemalan
military kept detailed records of people who were detained,
tortured and executed outside the law. The commission found the
Guatemalan military was responsible for 93 percent of all
documented human rights violations committed during the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked them for reports on specific cases of people who had
disappeared or who were killed on the street and they told us that
such documents did not exist,'' said Otilia Lucs de Oti, a former
commissioner and a leading spokeswoman for the nation's indigenous
communities. ``That was always their argument. But we knew that an
institution like the military, that takes such pride in its
history, had to have more than what they were giving to us.''
</P>
<P>
   She scanned the document and frowned. ``We asked them if they
had lists of people who disappeared and they told us, `no,''' she
said, referring to the military. ``This shows that they did not
tell us the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Separated into four main parts, the document contains
surveillance studies on reportedly subversive organizations, lists
of subversive safe houses that had been raided and the contents of
each house, and lists of organizations described as ``facades for
the service of subversion,'' including the Association of
University Students, the Democratic Front Against Repression and
Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
   The most chilling section is the chronological log book of
detainees. Numbered one through 183, each entry lists the
prisoner's name and alleged pseudonyms; the date and location of
capture; the prisoner's affiliations with suspected subversive
groups and any suspicious activities _ including travel to Cuba,
meetings held in homes, participation in demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Glued beside each entry is a wallet-sized photograph of the
detainee, which looks a lot like the mug shots used on
government-issued identification cards.
</P>
<P>
   And at the end of each entry is a line that describes the
prisoner's fate. A few dozen of those on the list were released,
some of them on the condition that they serve as informants for the
military and help turn in their associates. More than 100 people on
the list were executed, the investigators said. Their deaths were
described by the code ``300,'' or the phrase, ``He was taken away
by Pancho.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although codified and at times ungrammatical, the book is
suspenseful reading. Its entries, some a few lines long and others
a half-page each, tell of doctors and shoemakers, labor leaders and
students, mechanics and economists who were suspected of
participating in efforts to overthrow the military government of
Brig. Gen. Oscar Mejia Victores, according to the investigators.
</P>
<P>
   They were abducted in shopping areas, restaurants, movie
theaters, on the way to work or in their houses. Sometimes they
resisted, the document said, they were shot, and ``300.''
</P>
<P>
   One entry tells about an attempt to capture Edwin Rogelio Rivas
Rivas here.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they wanted to take '' the book said, ``he tried to flee
on a motorcycle, which made the necessity to shoot, falling gravely
wounded. It was tried to revive him on the H.M., but it was
impossible. 300. And he was left on the side of the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those detained, the book said, were members or
supporters of suspected subversive groups like the Guatemalan
Workers Party, the Guerrilla Army of the Poor and the Revolutionary
Organization of People in Arms.
</P>
<P>
   The book does not record the charges. It listed suspicious
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Prisoner No. 1, Teresa Graciela Samayoa Morales, the book said,
``traveled to Cuba.'' No. 17, Orencio Sosa Calderon ``is in charge
of taking foreign journalists to film different guerrilla fronts,''
another listing said. And No. 52, Prudencio de Jesus Carrera Camey,
15, an entry said, was a member of the Guatemalan Workers Party
``apparatus responsible for painting cars.''
</P>
<P>
   For the families of ``the disappeared,'' the dry shorthand
provides information denied over 15 or more years. In interviews
with relatives of two men and a woman listed as dead, family
members said they had ached to know what happened to their children
and siblings and, if killed, to be told where to look for the
remains.
</P>
<P>
   Only when they are able to mourn and bury their dead, the family
members agreed, would prosecutions of those responsible for the
killings be a concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``First I want to know if he died and where to find him,'' Ms.
Vasquz, 36, a lawyer, said. ``Then I want to know who did this?
Why?''
</P>
<P>
   She broke down in sobs as she talked in the office of the Group
of Mutual Support, an organization of families of the disappeared
that has more than 25,000 cases in its files.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no worse thing than uncertainty,'' she said. ``You
imagine that he went through the worst. My father thinks he is in
another country. He always talks in the present. `Omar must have
kids by now,' he says. My mom is more realistic. She sometimes
thinks he was killed.''
</P>
<P>
   The relatives confirmed dates of disappearances and other
information in the book. Ms. Vasquez confirmed that her brother had
belonged to both the Revolutionary Movement of the People and the
Revolutionary Organization of People in Arms, a main guerrilla
group. The information appeared on the log sheet next to his name,
along with ``doctor and surgeon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd tell me: `Let's fix the world,' Ms. Vasquez recalled.
``I'd reply, `Let's fix it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Shown a page that read ``06-05-84: 300'' under a photograph of
Lesbia Lucrecia Garcia Escobar, her father, Efrain Garcia, 66, made
a quick calculation. If she disappeared on April 17, 1984, Garcia
said, that meant that she had been kept alive for 20 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``During that time they were torturing her and getting stuff
from her,'' he said without a trace of doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The book said Ms. Garcia Escobar had shared a house with a
guerrilla where weapons, grenades and ``propaganda'' were found.
Garcia, a retired doorman at the Health Ministry, said his
daughter, then 29, had been abducted after a man walked into the
restaurant where she was dining with a girlfriend and told her that
her boyfriend was waiting outside. When she walked out, the
girlfriend later told Garcia, two men pushed her into a waiting
car.
</P>
<P>
   A witness gave Garcia the number of the license plate of a
motorcycle that he was told escorted the car, a number that he
continues to carry on a scrap of paper. He said he went to the
police with it, but was told that the plate did not exist. After
that, he recounted, two men began following him, leading him to
abandon his search, stay indoors for three months and eventually
move.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vasquez said she started searching for her brother only
after the peace accords of 1996 because family feared that if she
pressed for information she would risk danger.
</P>
<P>
   But others, like Jesus Palencia, 70, who is looking for the
oldest of her 10 children, have pressed and pushed the whole time.
Ms. Palencia said that for 15 years she has sent telegrams to the
National Palace, looked at hundreds of bodies in morgues and joined
in protests, occupations of public buildings and other
demonstrations by human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   Since the disappearance of the son, Alfonso Alvarado Palencia, a
former labor leader shown in the logbook as dead by March 1984, she
has also asked the Roman Catholic priest at her parish several
times to hold a Mass for her son's return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the priest to pray for my son's reappearance, but he
always says Mass as if my son were dead,'' Ms. Palencia said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets worse and worse as the years go by,'' she said of the
government's silence. ``Just a few months ago, I dreamed that
someone had knocked on the door, and it was him, dressed in a white
shirt. I ran to tell the others, `Look, children, here is your
brother.' And then I woke up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my son is dead, I want at least his little bones.''

HOUSTON BUSINESSMAN SEEKS CONSTRUCTION ON NEW FOOTBALL STADIUM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Ariz.)  
 
By JOHN WILLIAMS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Concerned that another NFL team may move to Houston
without his involvement, businessman Bob McNair is trying to
persuade local officials to build a new football stadium without a
guaranteed franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Such a strategy didn't work in San Antonio, Texas, where the
Alamodome, which opened in 1993, remains without a National
Football League team.
</P>
<P>
   But McNair believes there is virtually no risk in Houston,
because the city has a strong enough market that it will eventually
attract a team _ through expansion or relocation.
</P>
<P>
   McNair said he should be the owner of a local team rather than
someone like Arizona Cardinals owner Bill Bidwell, whose team could
be looking for a new home after Mesa, Ariz., voters rejected a
stadium referendum Tuesday by a 60-40 percent margin.
</P>
<P>
   McNair said Wednesday he is willing to front a substantial share
toward a new stadium, which would all but guarantee his involvement
in a local franchise should Houston get one.
</P>
<P>
   If Bidwell or any other owner wanted to move his team to
Houston, said McNair, he would have to sell at least a 30 percent
managing share to McNair for playing in the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to get a team, one way or another,'' McNair said.
``It's not like San Antonio, which does not have the business
climate that Houston does. Houston has supported a team in the past
and will support one in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past few weeks, McNair has been floating the idea among
public and private officials involved in plans for a $310 million
stadium the Harris County-Houston Sports Authority has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have said the stadium would be built only if Houston
got a team. But amid concerns that Houston could attract a bad
owner, especially one without local roots, they have been seeking
ways to give McNair more leverage in his efforts to get a team.
</P>
<P>
   Many worried privately about the Bidwell family owning a team in
Houston. Under the family's ownership, the Cardinals are one of the
league's most vagabond franchises, moving from Chicago to St. Louis
to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately after the Cardinals left St. Louis in 1988,
officials there began trying to woo another team, and eventually
got the Rams from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The saga sounds similar to one in Houston. Work began on a
stadium plan almost immediately after Oilers owner Bud Adams
announced plans to move his team to Tennessee in three years after
he could not swing a deal here.
</P>
<P>
   County Judge Robert Eckels said Wednesday the concern about
ownership is a good reason not to rapidly dismiss McNair's idea of
building a stadium before Houston gets a team.
</P>
<P>
   It might be a good idea to start construction, Eckels said, if
McNair can promise his end of the bargain as originally planned,
predicated on Houston getting a team.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, the sports authority would provide $195 million
toward construction of a stadium and McNair would pledge $50
million in cash and $1.05 million annual rent plus revenues on
parking and other items totaling $2.96 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that a Houston football team have a local owner
who gets along well with the local community,'' said Eckels. ``Bob
McNair does that.''
</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   County Commissioner Steve Radack said he has no problem with the
plan, as long as the county doesn't have to pick up any of the tab.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone wants to spend money building a stadium on county
property, it sounds like a good idea,'' Radack said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo officials have similar concerns
about building a new stadium without a guaranteed team.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal cut with the sports authority, the rodeo would
share the cost of building the stadium, including paying $1.5
million annual rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, we want a successful partnership with a known
quantity rather than with someone who has not shown a track
record,'' said rodeo president Jim Bloodworth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't taken a position, but we would carefully watch who
our partner is. Bob McNair is not only a great individual, he's a
Houstonian.''
</P>
<P>
   But rodeo officials, concerned about duplicating the Alamodome's
woes, may not support construction of a new stadium without a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might be able to extend our exclusive agreement for 18
months to two years,'' said one rodeo source. ``But I doubt we
could go much further than that, because we need to spend money on
our existing home (Astrodome), and we couldn't wait much longer.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under the original deal, McNair has exclusive rights to a new
stadium through Jan. 31, 2000. But he is worried that an existing
owner with stadium problems, like Bidwell, might try to get the
Houston stadium plan for himself.
</P>
<P>
   By getting the exclusive agreement extended, McNair would have
more leverage in convincing an owner to sell him a managing share
of the team.
</P>
<P>
   In March, McNair wrote Bidwell and eight other NFL owners with
stadium problems offering to buy a portion or all of the team.
</P>
<P>
   McNair said Wednesday he has since had only a cursory discussion
with the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't talked since then, and we had nothing concrete to
say then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have not indicated what will happen to the team.
Besides looking at Houston, the team could examine moving to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, McNair said, the overwhelming defeat in Arizona
improves his chances of getting a team.
</P>
<P>
   First, he said, owners in other troubled cities will decide a
little quicker about whether to stay or move to Houston. If they
don't move quickly, they could lose out to the Cardinals, McNair
said.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, he said, it puts pressure on the NFL to award an
expansion franchise to Houston instead of Los Angeles, which is
getting no closer to a commitment for public money for stadium
plans there.
</P>
<P>
   NFL owners, who recently awarded a conditional franchise to Los
Angeles, will meet in Atlanta next week to examine L.A.'s efforts
to come up with a financing plan to renovate the Municipal
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the climate in Phoenix, Los Angeles and Chicago, where
no public money is coming forward for a stadium,'' McNair said, ``I
am not sure the NFL wants to turn down such a good deal in
Houston.''

GOP NIXES GORE-INSPIRED EARTH SATELLITE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a real life ``Star Wars'' battle on Capitol Hill
Wednesday, House Republicans prevailed by deleting a project
inspired by Vice President Al Gore to put a satellite in orbit that
would give Internet users a live, round-the-clock view of Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans decried the $32 million satellite plan, part of a
$42 billion bill funding NASA, as unnecessary, while Democrats
charged that the GOP was politicizing the project and killing it in
an orchestrated effort to ridicule Gore, the party's front-runner
in the 2000 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the Gore campaign viewed the force the Republicans
used to destroy the satellite funding as the sequel to their
trashing his claim of having invented the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The NASA funding bill, stripped of money for the so-called
Triana project, passed 259-168, with many Democrats _ including all
10 members of the Massachusetts delegation _ voting against the
overall measure.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats say they will push their colleagues in the
Senate to reinsert funding for the project. And the White House is
making noises about a veto if money for the Triana satellite
mission is not restored in the NASA bill, which also includes
funding for the space station and the space shuttle over the next
three years.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans said Gore was trying to spend $32 million for a
project of limited value. They argued that Earth-viewing already is
available on the Weather Channel, NASA's TV channel and on some Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need it. We've already got it there. It's free. Why
spend the money on something that someone came up with in a
dream?'' said Jim Wilkinson, a spokesman for House Majority Leader
Richard Armey, who helped lead the opposition to the Triana
satellite project.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson mocked Gore for saying he awoke one morning in early
1998 with the idea of a live, high-definition-TV image of the Earth
available on the Internet 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Armey once dreamed about catching a 10-foot bass,''
Wilkinson said about his boss, an avid fisherman, ``but he didn't
wake up and call the Fish and Wildlife Service to force them to
spend $30 million to make it a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA is currently scheduled to launch the Triana satellite in
December 2000. Although some analysts have questioned the
scientific value of the mission, supporters believe it will address
fundamental questions about the Earth's climate. NASA officials,
who lamented the project's defeat, lauded its scientific and
educational merits.
</P>
<P>
   Once in orbit, the spacecraft would measure the amount of the
sun's energy that the Earth reflects back to space. Because
sunlight is the principal engine that drives the weather, the
mission would allow a more accurate measure for climate models of
how much solar energy the Earth absorbs. Internet users would get
continuous views of the Earth from space and the natural phenomena
that affect it.
</P>
<P>
   Representative David Weldon, a Republican from Florida, who
offered the amendment to kill the funding, suggested it was unfair
that NASA was laying off 600 workers at Kennedy Space Center at the
same time it was ``finding tens of millions of dollars to fulfill a
vision for the vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Nichols, spokeswoman for House Minority Leader Richard A.
Gephardt, said Triana was a ``good political issue'' for
Republicans, since they have spent little energy doing other
legislative work. ``It's sort of silly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols said Armey, a staunch Clinton-Gore critic who has
claimed credit for leaking Gore's boast about inventing the
Internet, ``has decided that his role in life is to try to be a
thorn in Mr. Gore's side.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson shot back: ``We've decided our role in life is to stop
bad policies and enact good ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Gore, referred to the House
Republican leaders as ``Luddites'' the group of early 19th century
English workmen who destroyed labor-saving machinery as a protest.
They have ``politicized Kosovo, Y2K efforts, hurricane reliefs,
farm aid, guns, and now even science,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a safety lock on the GOP to help protect the American
people from such blatant partisanship,'' he said. ``If the
Republicans were around 400 years ago, they probably would have
attacked Galileo as well.''
</P>
<P>
   And brushing off attacks on Gore's ideas, Lehane continued, ``We
recognize that the Republicans will stoop as low as possible in
their efforts to attack the vice president, as they did for six
years with the president. And now they are turning their guns on
the vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all scientists agree the project is worthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of any scientist who is saying they need it. This
is almost pure showmanship, and there's no science being
addressed,'' said Richard S. Lindzen, a professor of earth,
atmospheric and planetary science at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very difficult to use video images of the Earth for
serious work evaluating climate changes or land use,'' Lindzen
said, because those rely on infrared scanning or other advanced
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the Triana proposal an example of NASA's ``shoving more
hardware into space'' to please politicians, Lindzen said, ``The
only thing this does is use resources and give you a Web site with
pictures, but I know of no one who is saying, `I need this for
science.' ''
</P>
<P>
   However, Boston University professor Farouk El-Baz, director of
the Remote Sensing Center, disagreed. He said the Triana images
could be ``of great significance'' in helping authorities monitor
forest fires, oil spills, dust storms, or other large-scale natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This particular satellite would not be able to focus on
particular areas,'' El-Baz said, but it could play a key role
giving researchers a new way to monitor macro-level changes on
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scientific and research value is really in the timely
images of events as they are happening,'' said El-Baz, whose center
three years ago used satellite-imaging techniques to corroborate
that up to 1 million people attended the Nation of Islam's
``Million Man March'' in Washington.

<TEXT>
<P>
   All around the country, farmers are about to finish sowing
millions of acres of a genetically altered form of corn that
protects itself from pests by producing a toxin in its tissues. But
researchers report on Thursday that this increasingly popular
transgenic plant, thought to be harmless to nonpest insects,
produces a wind-borne pollen that can kill monarch butterflies _ a
species that claims the corn belt as the heart of its breeding
range.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said that the laboratory study, conducted by a team
from Cornell University, provides the first evidence that pollen
from a transgenic plant can be harmful to nonpest species. As such,
the study is likely to become part of the growing debate about
whether genetically engineered crops may have unforeseen effects on
the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Transgenic crops have proven tremendously popular with American
farmers in recent years. This season the new pest-resistant corn,
introduced by seed companies just three years ago, is being planted
on an estimated 10 million to 20 million acres out of an
80-million-acre corn crop nationwide. Known as Bt corn, it carries
a gene derived from a bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, that
produces the Bt toxin, killing corn borer pests that try to eat the
plant.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers fed monarch caterpillars leaves of milkweed,
their only food, which had been dusted with Bt corn pollen, regular
corn pollen or no pollen. Half of those fed Bt corn pollen died
within four days, while all those fed regular corn pollen or no
pollen survived. The study, published on Thursday in the journal
Nature, was written by Dr. John E. Losey, an entomologist, Dr.
Linda S. Rayor, a behavioral ecologist, and Maureen E. Carter, a
biologist.
</P>
<P>
   The Bt toxin itself is already known to be lethal to many
butterflies and moths. Researchers said this suggests that
butterfly or moth species other than the monarch could be affected
by the transgenic plant, particularly those that live on plants
like milkweeds that are often found in and around corn fields and
could be dusted by Bt corn pollen. But researchers note that the
effect of Bt corn pollen on populations of wild insects is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Academic researchers praised the study as a first step toward
understanding a previously unsuspected risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody had considered this before,'' said Dr. Fred Gould,
insect ecologist at North Carolina State University. ``Should we be
concerned? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Obrycki, an entomologist at Iowa State University,
called the new study ``solid'' and said: ``You now have a novel
means of distributing Bt toxins in the environment. This is a
technology that's being promoted and we haven't really considered
all the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from Novartis Agribusiness Biotechnology,
Monsanto and Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc., the top sellers of
Bt corn, challenged the significance of the findings for monarch
caterpillars, also known as larvae, outside the laboratory.
Researchers estimate that Bt corn is a product worth hundreds of
millions of dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
   Taking issue with the methods and conclusions of the study, Rich
Lotstein, vice president of public affairs for Novartis
Agribusiness Biotechnology, said, ``Even if Dr. Losey's results are
real, which they could be, the exposure is still minimal, and the
impact is extremely small, if any.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers, including the authors, said it is still unknown how
much of an impact Bt corn pollen is having on wild monarch
populations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be very surprised if there are no monarch larvae being
killed,'' Losey said. But he added, how many are being killed,
``that's the big question.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said they do know from a study published last year
that it is the corn belt, which includes such states as Iowa,
Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, that produces about half of the
monarchs that migrate each year to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   And across that geographic expanse, said Dr. Karen Oberhauser,
an ecologist at the University of Minnesota, there was certainly
potential for corn pollen and monarch caterpillars to cross paths.
``There are a lot of monarch larvae around in July and August and
that's when pollen is being shed,'' she said. ``The timing is
exactly wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   How much milkweed is close enough to corn fields to be at risk
of receiving a dusting of pollen is unknown. But as Dr. Marlin
Rice, entomologist at Iowa State University, put it, in many
heavily farmed states, ``if you're a monarch, odds are you're going
to be close to a cornfield.''
</P>
<P>
   Monarchs are not considered endangered, but Dr. Lincoln Brower,
a monarch biologist at Sweet Briar College in Sweet Briar, Va.,
said the butterfly faces a growing number of pressures. The No. 1
threat, he said, is still logging in the butterfly's winter resting
grounds in Mexico. Other threats include roadside mowing and the
use of herbicides on milkweeds.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever level of threat Bt corn pollen turns out to pose, it is
almost certainly less damaging to monarchs and insect diversity in
general than the spraying of insecticides. But Obrycki said that in
many areas of the country, farmers do not typically spray for corn
borer.
</P>
<P>
   Still others viewed the new study as a broader sign of the
danger of transgenic crops and the need for tighter regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Margaret Mellon, director of the agriculture and
biotechnology program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said:
``Why is it that this study was not done before the approval of Bt
corn? This is 20 million acres of Bt corn too late. This should
serve as a warning that there are more unpleasant surprises
ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Phillip O. Hutton, chief of the microbial pesticides branch
at the Environmental Protection Agency, which regulates the
commercial availability of Bt corn, declined to comment on the new
study, saying the paper had not yet gone through the agency's
scientific review. In addition to Bt corn, the EPA has approved Bt
potatoes and Bt cotton, both of which are commercially available.
</P>
<P>
   For the farmers, losses of monarch butterflies _ which neither
help nor hurt crops _ may be hard to measure against the gains from
this powerful new product. Previously, farmers had to scout their
crops diligently for signs of the corn borer and spray at just the
right time in an infestation to kill them. Now they can plant Bt
corn and let the internally produced toxins do all the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an amazing technology,'' said David Linn, a corn and
soybean farmer in Correctionville, Iowa, who plants Bt and regular
corn. ``Does it kill more monarchs or not? That's so far down on
the list of things we have to decide about.''

SIMILARITIES TO BOSTON MURDER SEEN IN FLORIDA CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RIC KAHN AND DANIEL VASQUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Police in Hollywood, Fla., have asked the FBI to help them
investigate a grisly murder which has eerie similarities to the
unsolved slaying of Karina Holmer, a Swedish au pair whose severed
torso was found in a Boston trash container nearly three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When the beaten body of Delia Lorna Mendez, a 34-year-old street
prostitute, was discovered in the parking lot of a pet supermarket
in Hollywood, Fla., Sunday afternoon, it sparked conjecture that
the killer could be the same one who murdered the 20-year-old au
pair because of the ways in which the victims were disposed of.
</P>
<P>
   Both women had been killed, then cut in half _ apparently with a
power instrument, possibly a circular saw _ then discarded in a
Dumpster. The Mendez murder was the first time a body had been
mutilated that way since Holmer's remains were found in a Fenway
receptacle in June 1996, Boston police say.
</P>
<P>
   Although police found both halves of Mendez's severed body,
Boston police said a Hollywood detective received three anonymous
tips alluding to the Holmer case. Hollywood police adamantly deny
that scenario.
</P>
<P>
   There are obvious differences between the two murders: The
victims are about 14 years apart in age; Mendez was a brunette who
was severely beaten and Holmer, a blonde, had been strangled;
Holmer's torso also had been cleaned and wrapped in plastic, unlike
Mendez' bloody body. The bottom half of her body was never found.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Mendez homicide could provide local authorities with
their most promising lead in finding Holmer's killer in the past
two years, Boston police said Wednesday they have no plans to send
detectives to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a body in Florida; we have a body in Boston. Other
than that, there is no connection,'' said Boston Police
Superintendent Donald Devine.
</P>
<P>
   From his home in Sweden, Holmer's father Wednesday expressed
disappointment with that conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a bit surprised if they don't show any interest'' in
checking whether the crimes are related, said Ola Holmer. He said
Boston police had not contacted him about the possible new
development.
</P>
<P>
   Florida authorities said they have not found evidence that the
murders are related, but have not ruled out that possibility.
``Everything's wide open,'' said Hollywood Police Lt. Chad Wagner,
but there are no suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner said police questioned Michael Schulerman, Mendez'
boyfriend, and searched his home after he reported her missing. He
was then released. As part of the probe, Wagner said, police will
investigate whether Schulerman had any Boston connections.
</P>
<P>
   But Florida police said their detectives must first sift through
a mound of physical evidence found in the Dumpster before they will
know whether to bring Boston into the investigation. The cause of
Mendez's death has not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Detective Paul Farrahar, head of Boston Police's homicide
unit, said Wednesday he plans to wait until Hollywood police finish
their preliminary investigation, and ``if sometime in the future it
seems appropriate to send our investigators there, we certainly
will. It's just too early to speculate on possible connections.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Florida police have asked the FBI to help them
narrow the scope of suspects. The characteristics of the crime will
be entered into a national database to match against other
incidents, and federal authorities will use those details to create
a profile of the possible killer, including occupation and
personality traits.
</P>
<P>
   Holmer's upper torso was found in a Dumpster in Fenway following
a night out downtown. Authorities determined that she'd been
strangled, then her torso cleanly severed. The rest of her body has
never been found.

SERB WOMEN CONTINUE TO PROTEST AGAINST ARMY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Women in two towns in southern Serbia
continued their street protests Wednesday, demanding that their
sons be allowed to return home from army service in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Their pleas seemed to be answered in part when truckloads of
soldiers arrived home, residents said. NATO officials said in
Brussels that the soldiers were deserters.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth day running, hundreds of mothers, wives and
sisters of conscripted soldiers and reservists sent to Kosovo
demonstrated in Krusevac and Aleksandrovac, 100 miles south of
Belgrade and close to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Army trucks full of soldiers arrived later in the day, one
resident said. Some people talked to the soldiers and were told
they were on their way to their garrison to return their weapons,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers' return to Krusevac appeared to be calm, but there
were reports of shooting in Aleksandrovac.
</P>
<P>
   According to NATO officials, more than 500 reservists from the
7th Infantry Brigade in Istok, in Kosovo, hurried back to Krusevac
after hearing of the protests.
</P>
<P>
   The women's protests reportedly began after the bodies of seven
soldiers were brought back to Krusevac on Friday, and three to
Aleksandrovac, together with a number of wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The women had been parading through the two towns, and hurled
stones and eggs at the town hall in Krusevac on Tuesday before
being dispersed by the police, according to local sources quoted by
the Belgrade-based VIP news agency.
</P>
<P>
   One witness reached by telephone said the crowd of women in
Krusevac on Tuesday numbered about 1,000. Many blew whistles, a
tactic employed by pro-democracy demonstrators during the weeks of
protests in Belgrade during the winter of 1996-1997.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations do not appear to be politically motivated,
but were more a spontaneous event, residents said.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrations have also been reported in Cacak, not far from
Belgrade, where the municipal authorities are run by the democratic
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   All such gatherings are technically prohibited under the
emergency military rule introduced in Yugoslavia when the NATO air
campaign began on March 24. Foreign journalists, who are prohibited
from traveling outside Belgrade without permission, have been
unable to visit Krusevac and Aleksandrovac.
</P>
<P>
   But the authorities have allowed the protests to continue,
probably because they mostly involve soldiers' mothers. Large
numbers of reservists have been called up in southern Serbia and
have been sent along with regular units of draftees to Kosovo.
Units generally spend two weeks in the province and then return
home for a two-day break.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The local unhappiness seems to be aimed at the local
authorities. The official state news media have been announcing the
withdrawal of troops from Kosovo for more than a week now, and
families are angry that their sons have still not come home.
</P>
<P>
   No official figures of casualties among police and army
personnel in Kosovo have been released.
</P>
<P>
   Some soldiers returning from Kosovo have played down the danger
posed by NATO bombing. Two soldiers who returned recently on leave
told relatives and friends that they are managing to avoid the
bombs by sheltering in deep cellars or trenches.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless the demonstrations seem to have ruffled the
authorities. The commander of the garrison at Krusevac criticized
the organizers and the ``destructive character'' of the gatherings.
``The best feelings of the parents were abused by the organizers,
who have mainly been identified,'' he said in a statement published
in the daily Glas Javnosti. ``No issue will be resolved on the
street.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties, wary of a crackdown by the authorities, have
been careful to distance themselves from the local demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   The headquarters of the Democratic Party came under attack
Wednesday from stone-throwing demonstrators who, party members
said, were almost certainly sent by the police. Twenty
tough-looking men with cropped hair and wearing leather jackets
drove up mid-morning in half a dozen Mercedeses and BMWs and began
throwing stones and eggs at the building. A crowd of 100 people
gathered, shouting, ``We will not give up Kosovo!'' and calling the
party members inside traitors.
</P>
<P>
   The police looked on passively, according to Liljana Lucic, the
party's vice president, who was inside for most of the two-hour
attack. &QL;

ALLISON REFUTES SINDEN CRITICISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Jason Allison hadn't heard the comments his boss,
Harry Sinden, made after Tuesday night's game in Buffalo. After
being eliminated by the Sabres in the Eastern Conference
semifinals, Allison boarded the charter flight home with his
teammates and management and experienced the same disappointment,
numbness, exhaustion, and frustration they all felt.
</P>
<P>
   So, when the Bruins center arrived at the FleetCenter for the
annual disbursement proceedings (re: meet the media, sign a ton of
souvenirs), he read the critical remarks made about him and
linemate Dmitri Khristich by the club's president/general manager
and it hit him like a slap in the face.
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said he thought his team was mediocre through too much of
the six-game series against the Sabres and that Khristich and
Allison were subpar at least in part because of the money paid to
them last fall when Allison was a holdout and Khristich went to
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   To say that Allison took issue with Sinden's comments is an
understatement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to blame somebody for it,'' Allison said with an
edge to his voice. ``I can be happy with my effort. I played the
best I could. Maybe I could've played better but it wasn't from
lack of effort. That's his opinion, what he wants to say. It seems
like it's someone different's fault every year. How many years had
it been since they got out of the first round? With 10 different
coaches and 500 different players. It's my fault this time, I
guess. I'll take the blame. He must have seen something real bad
that I didn't notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison said he was surprised and hurt by Sinden's assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know it until I got here,'' he said. ``I played
hurt for him over the two years numerous times. This year, I had a
badly sprained wrist and I could've been out for a couple of weeks
or a month but we were in a playoff hunt and I didn't miss a game.
I did everything I could to play. I'm not blaming (the wrist) for
the playoffs. I'm just bringing it up because I don't know if the
approach he took was a very classy one.''
</P>
<P>
   That being said, Allison, who led the team in scoring with 76
points, said he knows that he had his moments through the season
when he wasn't his best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed at different times during the year with my
play,'' said Allison, who had seven fewer points than last regular
season. ``I don't think I totally had a bad year at all. I don't
think I totally had a bad playoffs. I probably could've played
better. I still had pretty much my average for points I've had over
the last two years.''
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to Allison, he was one of the Bruins' more reliable
forwards. There was only one time during the regular season when he
failed to score in four straight games. And part of Allison's
problem during the playoffs was that Khristich was invisible much
of the time and Sergei Samsonov was far less than 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it, when it comes to cultivating warm and fuzzy
feelings, the Bruins will never be confused with Barry and Eliot of
Jordan's Furniture, who recently flew all their employees to
Bermuda as a gesture of thanks.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the Bruins and everyone else would argue that with
the salaries pro hockey players make, they can fly themselves and
everyone they know to Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   Allison's point was that his play had nothing to do with his
salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comments about the money are ridiculous,'' said Allison,
who had 11 points in 12 postseason contests. ``If you look at the
money I made this year, compared to my numbers, I probably actually
overachieved in the league's salaries and I don't think anyone can
argue that point. For what he said, that giving the money changes
us, that's why we didn't play well, it's a crock. Maybe that's his
way of covering himself, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison said coach Pat Burns tried to soften the blow of
Sinden's comments but from the sound of it, it didn't work all that
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to him again and he said, `Don't let it bother you
too much,' '' said Allison. ``I said I won't. I don't think I
played badly this year or in the playoffs but I think I can reach a
higher level. He said, `You played good, don't worry about it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Try as he might, Allison couldn't hide his hurt. He said it
wouldn't affect his summer or anything else but it was clear that
he was trying to make sense of being publicly criticized. It was
equally clear he felt blindsided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why he said them,'' said Allison. ``It really
upset me that he was talking about the money. That's what it's
always about. It's always got something to do with the money. I
could've had four more points this year and he would've been paying
me an extra million dollars (an incentive clause for reaching 80
points) and then he could maybe say something, I don't know. To me,
it didn't make much sense. It seems he always has to fall back on
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison ran the gamut from defiant to hurt to confused. He said
he didn't want to fan the flames of controversy but at the same
time, he felt the need to express and defend himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way they have a right to criticize players sometimes
because they're paying you and they are your boss and they have an
organization to run but sometimes they've gone about it the wrong
way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Allison said he has significant plans this offseason to improve
his conditioning. He plays a lot of minutes, more than any other
forward on the team, and he said he wants to improve his skating
and endurance. He is planning to work with Olympic speedskater
Kevin Scott from Calgary for perhaps as long as a month. Skating
has been a knock on Allison throughout his career and he said he
wants to change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I realized this year, if I'm going to play 22, 25
minutes _ I played 28 one game _ if you're going to be doing that,
you have to reach a totally other level of conditioning because
it's too tough,'' he said. ``You can't play your best if you're out
there tired all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that workload made him appreciate what Ray Bourque does
even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelieveable, he's a freak of nature,'' said Allison.
``That's genetic, too, with Ray. He works extremely hard but to be
at the level he's at, it's genetic, too. He runs and trains but he
cannot skate all summer and skate for three days and be in great
shape. I don't play a finesse game. It's down low, outmuscling
guys. That takes more energy than maybe some of the skilled guys
playing 20 minutes a game. I have to work for my ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison said he wants to get better and is hoping that the sting
from Sinden's comments doesn't last. He said they had a domino
effect through the dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys other than myself are upset,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The most pointed of whom was Anson Carter, who had his own
contract squabbles with the team that led to a holdout last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was upset about it,'' said Carter. ``He has his own opinion,
obviously, he's the boss. But I thought Ally played well. Just
because of what he's being paid, he's being blamed due to his
salary. I'm sick and tired of money being a big issue of everything
that's being said around here. If something is said, it's always
about money. It's the root of everything that happens around here.
His numbers speak for themselves. The guys in the room know that
he's putting forth every effort and that he plays hurt so why would
you bring up the money factor? They make you think he's greedy and
he's not.''

CBS TO INTRODUCE SIX NEW SERIES, MOVE FIVE OTHERS AROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CBS on Wednesday said it will introduce six new series next fall
and shuffle five others on its prime-time schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The new series include three dramas featuring familiar names
like Tyne Daly, Dixie Carter and Kathleen Quinlan, and three
comedies with the likes of Nancy Travis, Sharon Lawrence and Betty
White.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule leaves Monday as a comedy-heavy night capped by a
10 p.m. drama. But ``Cosby,'' the linchpin of the network's Monday
night lineup the past two seasons, will move to Wednesdays at 8 in
the fall. ``The King of Queens'' will move from 8:30 into the 8
o'clock slot on Mondays.
</P>
<P>
   Also relocating are ``Chicago Hope,'' to Thursdays at 9;
``Diagnosis Murder,'' to Thursdays at 8, and ``60 Minutes II,'' to
Tuesdays at 9.
</P>
<P>
   A summary of CBS's new series:
</P>
<P>
   Family Law. One-hour drama co-produced by Paul Haggis (``EZ
Streets'') about a motley group of lawyers thrown together by
unexpected circumstances, namely, the breakup of Lynn Holt's
marriage. Holt's husband takes their law practice with him, forcing
Holt (Kathleen Quinlan) to start over from scratch. Best character
name: Randi King, the new firm's divorce lawyer, played by Dixie
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Judging Amy. Hourlong drama based on the life of Amy Brenneman's
mother. Brenneman plays Amy Gray, a divorced mom who leaves New
York to become a judge in Hartford, Conn. Tyne Daly plays her
opinionated mother. Best character name: It's gotta be Amy.
</P>
<P>
   Now &AMP; Again. One-hour action-drama about a middle-age insurance
agent whose body is destroyed in an accident but whose brain is
unharmed. He lets the government transplant his brain into the
hunky body of Ben (Eric Close), but he has to agree to become a
government agent and give up his old life _ including his wife and
family. Best character name: Theo. No it's not Kojak incarnate.
Theo is Ben's controller, played by Dennis Haysbert.
</P>
<P>
   Ladies Man. Alfred Molina plays Jimmy Stiles, a guy surrounded
by women: his wife, his ex-wife, his two daughters, his mother and
his mother-in-law. Sharon Lawrence plays the current wife, Park
Overall is the ex, Betty White is the mom. Best character name:
Peaches, the mother-in-law. (Dixie Carter played her in the pilot,
but Carter has a leading role in ``Family Law,'' so the part is
being recast.)
</P>
<P>
   Work With Me. Nancy Travis and Kevin Pollak play a husband and
wife whose separate law careers become one when they join forces in
the same firm. Best character name: Sebastian (Ethan Embry), an
office assistant who's dating the other office assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Love or Money. Half-hour romantic comedy set in a posh Manhattan
apartment building. Cellar-dwelling maintenance man (Dash Mihok)
loves high-born kindergarten teacher (Paget Brewster). Swoosie
Kurtz and David Ogden Stiers play the billionaire parents. Best
character name: Puff Conklin (Judy Greer), the empty-headed sister.

<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ A powerful bomb exploded Wednesday on a busy
street in a crowded ethnic Albanian neighborhood here, severely
injuring two men and raising fears of more violence as the huge
influx of ethnic Albanian refugees from Kosovo continues.
</P>
<P>
   One man was so badly burned by the powerful blast that he could
not initially be identified. Another had a leg torn off that landed
in a playground 30 feet from the scene of the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   By evening, Macedonian government officials said they had made
no arrests in the bombing and had no suspects. The explosion
followed a series of increasingly violent rocket and grenade
attacks on French soldiers in the NATO contingent here.
</P>
<P>
   Residents and passers-by gawked at the debris from the
explosion, which destroyed a car and blew the glass out of nearby
store windows.
</P>
<P>
   Sali Tahiri, 32, a clerk in a nearby auto parts store who helped
rush the victims to the hospital in taxis, said the intent of the
bombers was clearly ``to destabilize Macedonia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a neighborhood where the inhabitants are mostly
Albanians,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the Slav majority in Macedonia and the sizable
ethnic Albanian community _ up to one-third of the country's
roughly 2 million inhabitants _ have been tense ever since
Macedonia won independence from the old Yugoslavia in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The influx of nearly 200,000 ethnic Albanian refugees from
neighboring Kosovo over the past eight weeks has increased those
tensions markedly. The refugees complain of rough treatment and
discrimination from Macedonian police and officials; the Macedonian
government has stressed that it has sheltered the refugees despite
the antagonism, but insisted that many be taken to third countries
to prevent tensions from boiling over into violence.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia is home to a small Serb minority, and many of its
Slavs sympathize with the Serbs in fighting to retain Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of both the Macedonian and ethnic Albanian communities
here have called for restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Stevo Pendarovski, a spokesman for the Macedonian Interior
Ministry, said the bomb exploded at 1:30 p.m. in a mostly Albanian
neighborhood in northeastern Skopje. He said witnesses described
the bomb as a small package wrapped in plastic and tied with twine
or wire, placed in the center of a traffic lane. The blast felled
the two men as they crossed the street and blew the windows out of
a nearby shop and parked car.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's bombing campaign against Yugoslavia is broadly unpopular
here, and rocks have been hurled at vehicles belonging to NATO's
contingent in Macedonia for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Since late April, French soldiers stationed in northeast
Macedonia have come under more direct attack. The area is home to
most of Macedonia's small Serb minority, and is also the region
where three U.S. servicemen fell into Yugoslav hands in disputed
circumstances in late March.
</P>
<P>
   Two grenades were thrown from a passing car at a French sentry
outside a base at Kumanovo, but missed their target. On April 29, a
short-range anti-tank rocket fired at a passing French jeep in the
area also missed its target.
</P>
<P>
   On May 10, a rocket fired at a French heliport in Kumanovo
missed its target. Three days ago, another rocket was fired at a
small hotel in the area used as a French base, but also failed to
strike the building. A French jeep was seized and burned by angry
Serbs last month after a NATO vehicle broke down in a Serb village.

 UFW Wins `Company Unions' Dispute
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Ilana DeBare &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
About 18 strawberry growers and farm groups have agreed to stop
funding worker committees that served as rivals to the United Farm
Workers union, as part of a settlement of a UFW lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   UFW officials _ who had slammed the worker committees as
``company unions'' _ announced the settlement at a press conference
yesterday in Watsonville.
</P>
<P>
   They called it a victory for the union that comes just as the
UFW is preparing for a potentially critical election at Coastal
Berry Co., the state's largest strawberry grower.
</P>
<P>
   ``This confirms our warnings that strawberry growers have been
illegally repressing workers' right to organize by funding these
sham organizations,'' said UFW President Arturo Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sends a message that company unionism is illegal in
California,'' added UFW spokesman Marc Grossman.
</P>
<P>
   Growers, meanwhile, downplayed the actual impact of the
settlement. They pointed out that the specific worker committees
that sparked the suit no longer exist. Other parts of the
settlement, which include payment of attorneys' fees to the UFW,
were confidential.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committees (named in the suit) are long gone, out of
business, so nothing's at issue,'' said Terrence O'Connor, a lawyer
for the Western Growers Association, which took part in the
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit and settlement dealt with the relationship between
strawberry growers and groups such as the now-defunct Pro Workers
Committee, an anti-UFW group that held a 5,000-person march in
Salinas in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The UFW had alleged that the worker groups were committing fraud
by claiming to be independent of employers. As the lawsuit
progressed, the union discovered evidence of $56,000 in company
payments to the worker groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We subpoenaed the committees' bank records, but they said they
lost them, so we subpoenaed the Bank of America,'' said the UFW's
Grossman. ``Every time we found a new canceled check (from a
grower), we added a new defendant.''
</P>
<P>
   A Santa Cruz Superior Court judge ruled last winter that two of
the growers had violated a section of the state labor code barring
agricultural employers from providing money to farm labor
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Those two growers have appealed the verdict. Meanwhile, about 18
others signed a settlement promising not to fund workers' groups in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Some growers said they hadn't done anything illegal but signed
the settlement to avoid a costly legal fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these guys just bought hats for their workers from the
organization, which isn't illegal,'' said O'Connor. ``But it's like
a nuisance lawsuit. If it costs $1,000 to defend but $500 to
settle, then you'll settle it.''
</P>
<P>
   The UFW has spent the past three years trying to organize
California's 30,000-worker strawberry industry. It faced a big
setback last summer, when workers at Coastal Berry voted for
representation by a rival group.
</P>
<P>
   But the state Agricultural Labor Relations Board overturned that
election on May 6, and the UFW has asked the state to schedule a
new election at Coastal Berry.

 Healtheon, WebMD Close to Merger
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Jon Swartz &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Two health-related Internet companies _ Santa Clara's Healtheon and
WebMD of Atlanta _ confirmed yesterday that they are close to
merging into a new company that would be a dominant player in
online medical information and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, Intel and Excite are likely to invest a total of $500
million in the merged company, to be called WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon shares shot up $24.38 to $80.25 per share yesterday,
giving the company a market value of $5.7 billion. That's the value
analysts are giving the deal, since WebMD is privately held. Each
company would own 50 percent of the new one.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon stock has soared 70 percent since Bloomberg News first
disclosed the discussions on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which only went public in February, operates a Web
site where patients and health care workers can monitor insurance
claims and get and make referrals. Doctors also can use the system
to order supplies and check lab results.
</P>
<P>
   WebMD, formed in October, offers information and discussion
forums on medical topics.
</P>
<P>
   If consummated, the merged company presumably would create a
medical portal for one-stop shopping and information.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon chief executive Michael Long would be chairman and
chief operating officer of the merged company; WebMD Chief
Executive Officer Jeffrey Arnold would be its CEO. Neither side
would say where the merged company would be headquartered.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon's board has rubber-stamped the deal, and WebMD's
directors were expected to vote on the plan yesterday. An
announcement should come later this week, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is expected to invest $200 million in the new company,
and Intel, Excite and San Francisco's McKesson HBOC would put in
another $300 million, said sources close to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   While a health care portal sounds like an exciting concept,
trying to tame the unwieldy, fragmented medical profession is an
``enormous challenge,'' said Jack Staff, an analyst at Zona
Research, a market-research firm in Redwood City.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an industry with a tremendous amount of data changing
hands,'' Staff said. ``Healtheon needs the help of plenty of
software and Internet partners, folks like Microsoft, Excite and
Intel, to make all these applications work. It is a daunting
task.''
</P>
<P>
   Health care has lagged behind other industries in automating
paperwork. Most medical concerns still rely on antiquated computer
networks, and nearly one-fourth of the $1 trillion spent on health
care in the United States each year is wasted on inefficiencies and
poor communications within the industry, according to Healtheon.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon was founded by Long and Jim Clark, the entrepreneur
behind Netscape Communications and Silicon Graphics. Clark is
Healtheon's chairman and will continue as a board member of the
combined company.
</P>
<P>
   The 727-person company _ backed by the powerful venture capital
firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers _ last month announced plans
to acquire another rival, Mede America Corp., for $460 million in
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Internet firms, Healtheon has yet to turn a profit.
The company lost $54 million last year on sales of $48.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   WebMD, which employs 182, is backed by DuPont Co., the biggest
U.S. chemical company, and McKesson HBOC, the nation's biggest drug
wholesaler. One source estimated the 7-month-old startup has less
than $100,000 in sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Profits have nothing to do with the ($5.7 billion) merger
value,'' one WebMD insider said. ``It's about being first in your
market.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After several days of escalating feuds between
Republicans and Democrats, the Senate pulled back from the brink of
a partisan meltdown Wednesday night and seemed poised for a final
vote on Thursday on a juvenile crime bill that has become a vehicle
for several new gun control measures.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the House, Democrats were emboldened by signs that
their Republican colleagues might be open to some new gun control
and said Wednesday that they would move on Thursday to introduce
gun-control amendments to two bills being completed in separate
House committees.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., and Nita M. Lowey, D-N.Y., said
that they would offer, as amendments to a postal service
appropriations bill, proposals calling for mandatory background
checks on all buyers at gun shows and a raise in the minimum age
for legal possession of a handgun to 21 from 18.
</P>
<P>
   Both are measures that on Tuesday drew at least some support
from House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois. Hastert said he
personally favored background checks at gun shows and a minimum age
of 21 for handgun purchases, though not handgun possession.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee said Wednesday that
they would offer similar amendments to a juvenile crime bill that
also might come up for final revisions on Thursday, but senior
Republican aides said the measures were technically not germane to
the bill and would be rejected on those grounds.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Republicans and Democrats made significant
progress late Wednesday on combining and condensing pending
amendments so that they might be able to get to a final vote on the
bill by Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, had previously
said that if work on the bill was not completed by then, he would
be forced to put it aside for an indefinite period of time.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., said Wednesday night that the
melding Wednesday of many pending amendments into a single package
to be offered by him and Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, had
significantly diminished the chances of that indefinite delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It removes an awful lot of obstacles,'' Leahy said Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate was scheduled to vote on that package and four other
amendments, including one gun control measure, late Wednesday
night. Early Wednesday afternoon, the Senate passed three other
amendments to the bill.
</P>
<P>
   A provision of one amendment would institute financial penalties
for states whenever violent criminals released from the state's
prisons went on to commit similar crimes in other states. A
provision of another amendment would allow schools to use federal
education funds for security and safety purposes, like the purchase
of metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate rejected an amendment that would create an additional
$340 million annually so that schools could hire more guidance
counselors, but it approved the creation of a National Commission
on Character Development to look into the effect of cultural
influences on good citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   As the Senate took that step, Republicans continued to press
reluctant Democrats for an agreement on a time limit to finish work
on the bill, and even some Democrats suggested that colleagues on
their own side of the aisle were dragging their feet, more
interested in keeping alive a debate on gun control than in putting
the bill to bed.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., said his colleagues were
struggling with conflicting desires to keep bashing Republicans for
the traditional resistance to gun control and to nudge those
gun-control measures already passed by the Senate toward law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a balance between the politics of letting them swing on
this stuff and actually doing some good,'' Biden said, referring to
Republicans. ``I, for one, would save them from themselves.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The gun-control amendment to be voted on would require that pawn
shops conduct background checks even on customers coming in to
reclaim their own guns.
</P>
<P>
   That requirement exists under current law but would have been
eliminated by a provision in a previous Republican amendment,
passed last week, that promoted mandatory background checks for all
buyers at gun shows. Democrats cited that provision as one of the
main reasons they planned to re-introduce a new version of their
own amendment requiring background checks at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican attempt to address that concern with a new
amendment was aimed at making certain that moderate Republicans did
not break party ranks and pass the resurrected Democratic proposal,
expected to come to a vote early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is siphoning off votes, patching another hole in their
leaky boat,'' said Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg, D-N.J., the principal
sponsor of the Democratic gun-show proposal. ``It's a desperation
tactic.''

 Swapping Motherboards Probably Makes Sense
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By David Einstein &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I currently have a Windows system with a 233 MHz chip
that I got about a year and a half ago. I've been doing some
upgrades since then. I increased my memory to 128 megabytes, added
a recordable CD-ROM drive, a larger hard drive and a faster modem.
Now I'd like to replace the chip with a 500 MHz Pentium III. But to
do that I'd have to replace the computer's motherboard. Is that
worth it, or should I just get a new computer?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  My friend, you are an ideal candidate for motherboard
replacement surgery. Everything else that matters already has been
upgraded, so adding a fast Pentium would give you a
state-of-the-art system. However, the chip you're considering is
expensive _ around $700. A motherboard will cost you anywhere from
$85 to $150, depending on the number of expansion slots and whether
it has on-board sound and video. So you're probably looking at a
minimum of around $800. And that's if you do the upgrade yourself
(considering all the other stuff you've added, it should be easy
for you). If you have someone else do it, add another $100 to the
total.
</P>
<P>
   Is it worth it? I'd say so, because a brand new 500 MHz Pentium
III computer (without a monitor) would probably run you at least
$1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Two Questions Answered
</P>
<P>
   Q: I would like to know if America Online is an Internet browser
or an Internet service provider or both. Also, how many browsers
are there on the market, and which one do you like best?
</P>
<P>
   A: Hey, that's two questions! But since I'm in a kindly mood,
I'll answer them both. AOL is an Internet service provider, and its
software has a built-in browser, which happens to be a customized
version of Microsoft's Internet Explorer 4.
</P>
<P>
   Right now there are just two industrial-strength browsers in the
market. One is IE, which now is into version 5, and the other is
Netscape Navigator, which comes as part of Netscape Communicator
(version 4.6 was just released). Both are free downloads
( &LR; www.microsoft.com/ie  &LR; and  &LR; www.netscape.com &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   There are two other alternatives worth mentioning. One is Opera,
a $35 browser offered by a Norwegian company
( &LR; www.operasoftware.com &LR; ). &LR;   &LR; The other, which is free, is an early
version of a new kind of streamlined browser by NeoPlanet, and you
can download it at  &LR; www.neoplanet.com.  &LR; In a brief test-drive, I
found it to be quite fast and elegant.
</P>
<P>
   Just the Fax
</P>
<P>
   Q: I need to use my computer to send faxes, but Windows 98
doesn't seem to have a fax program. That's odd, because I seem to
recall that both Windows 3.1 and Windows 95 had one. What's the
story? And is there a workaround for this problem?
</P>
<P>
   A: Here's the deal. Microsoft Fax is included on the Windows 98
CD, but it doesn't install automatically when you install Windows.
You can install it yourself, however, like this: Put your Windows
98 CD into the CD-ROM drive, choose the Browse This CD option and
click your way to tools/ oldwin95/message/us. Double-click wms.exe
to install Windows Messaging. Then double-click awfax.exe to
install the fax program. Now restart your computer, and then
double-click the Inbox icon on the desktop. This will launch a
wizard that will guide you through the process of setting up
Microsoft Fax.
</P>
<P>
   If you have Microsoft's Outlook 98, there's another option open
to you: You can download a free copy of WinFax Starter Edition from
Symantec. To get it, go to Add/Remove Programs in the Windows
Control Panel and double-click Outlook 98 in the list of available
programs. Click Add New Components and choose Install from Web.
Then follow the instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Now, why did Microsoft leave the fax software out of Windows 98?
It probably has to do with the company's relationship with
Symantec. If Windows 98 had built-in faxing, you wouldn't need the
Symantec program that's available for Outlook, would you?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; TIP OF THE WEEK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  Backing up information on your hard drive used to be a pain, but
Windows 98's Backup utility makes it easy. Based on technology from
Seagate, the disk drive company, it lets you back up an entire disk
or just selected folders and files. And you can back them up to any
floppy, Zip or tape drive. You'll find the Backup utility by going
to Start/Programs/Accessories/System Tools.

$41 BILLION NASA FUNDING BILL CLEARS HOUSE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A $41.2 billion funding bill for NASA cleared the
House on Wednesday, but not before lawmakers engaged in partisan
wrangling over the Triana satellite, an Earth-viewing project
initiated by Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which outlines spending priorities for the
space agency into the next century, includes $7 billion for the
U.S. share of the international space station through 2002 but not
a dime for Gore's satellite proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the measure, which would give the space agency
slightly more money than the White House requested over the next
three years, are $7.8 billion for space shuttle missions and $4.2
billion for earth science programs.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, approved 259-168 with most Democrats opposing it, now
goes to the Senate. The bill authorizes spending but does not
appropriate money.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
All but one member of Texas' congressional delegation _ Rep. Lloyd
Doggett, D-Austin voted against it _ supported the bill.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If it becomes law, the measure would prohibit spending taxpayer
money on TransHab, an inflatable habitat for the space station that
is being developed at Johnson Space Center south of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Space agency administrator Dan Goldin has said he would ask
President Clinton to veto the bill if the final version does not
include money to continue the Triana satellite project, which Gore
has said came to him in the middle of the night last March.
</P>
<P>
   As envisioned by the vice president, the satellite would be
stationed halfway to the sun and would beam high-resolution images
of Earth to anyone with a television or access to the Internet. The
project is named for the lookout on Christopher Columbus's ship who
first spotted the New World.
</P>
<P>
   NASA agreed to tackle Gore's project and has since determined it
would provide scientists with views of changing clouds, the
planet's vegetation canopy, major fires and weather systems
currently monitored by satellites in much lower orbits.
</P>
<P>
   By October, the beginning of the budget year, NASA will have
spent $41 million developing the satellite, which is due for launch
during a space shuttle mission in December 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats accused the GOP of targeting the project in an effort
to embarrass the vice president, the leading candidate for the
Democratic presidential nomination next year. Scrapping Triana is
``totally parochial, totally partisan,'' said Rep. Bart Gordon, a
Tennessee Democrat who sees the Senate as the best chance of
reviving Triana funding.
</P>
<P>
   When Republicans on the House Science Committee last week
deleted Triana from the space agency bill, the $33 million sought
by the administration was transferred into cancer and microbiology
research overseen by NASA.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Science Committee Chairman James Sensenbrenner,
R-Wis., defended the transfer, saying it would be better spent ``on
medical research than on funding the vice president's late-night
inspiration for a multimillion-dollar screen saver,'' for computer
users.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dave Weldon, a Florida Republican, led the effort to scrap
Gore's satellite, saying it was embraced by NASA bureaucrats at the
same time they were laying off 600 employees at the Kennedy Space
Center in his district.
</P>
<P>
   The Triana project is ``an insult to the working men and women
at Kennedy Space Center who were being laid off while NASA was
scrambling to find tens of millions of dollars to fulfill a vision
for the vice president,'' Weldon said.
</P>
<P>
   The House also rejected an amendment, offered annually since the
project began, to halt U.S. involvement in the international space
station project. Also failing to win House approval was a proposal
to put a cap on U.S. spending on the space station and to end
Russian participation in the 16-nation project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think its a good deal for science,'' said Rep. Tim
Roemer, an Indiana Democrat and perennial leader of the drive to
eliminate space station funding. ``This project just doesn't live
up to NASA's past accomplishments.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republican Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, defended the space
station, saying it would be a mistake to scrap the project now that
two components have been launched and others appear on schedule.
``We cannot be afraid to fail. We cannot be afraid to experiment,''
DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's share of the space station costs have been increased by
about $5 billion by the failure of economically strapped Russia to
keep to the schedule its space agency and the 15 other nations
agreed to follow in developing, launching and assembling the
orbiting laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before approving the bill, House members turned back an effort
to transfer $100 million a year from the space station budget to
help pay for aeronautics research. The move to divert the money was
led by Virginia Reps. Herbert Bateman, a Republican, and Robert
Scott, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The two lawmakers represent parts of Hampton Roads, Va., where
NASA's Langley Research Center faces major funding shortages.
Seventy percent of the research at Langley focuses on aeronautics
research.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, NASA cancelled Langley's work on a high-speed
passenger jet that could travel from the U.S. to Asia in less than
five hours. Also scrapped by the space agency was Langley's
research into improve the safety, lower the cost and reduce the
environmental impact of current aircraft.

PICK UP STEAM

 &HT;    By BOB DEANS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The State Department showed spy photos Wednesday
that U.S. officials said prove the authenticity of a video-tape
documenting the alleged March massacre of 127 ethnic Albanian
civilians by Serb police in a village in northwest Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The video, shot by a refugee during a mass burial several days
after the alleged massacre at Izbica, contained graphic close-ups
of victims -- most of whom appeared to be elderly men -- whose
bloodied bodies, faces and clothing appeared to have been riddled
with bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav government has denied the attack and dismissed the
video as a fake.
</P>
<P>
   But the landscape, buildings and even trees seen in the video
match hand-in-glove with the features shown on U.S. spy photos of
the village, providing what State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin
called ``conclusive proof,'' that the video is authentic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time we've ever been able to link video
evidence with overhead imagery,'' Rubin told reporters after
presenting the intelligence photos and matching them with excerpts
from the video. ``The Serbs have lied to the world about what
happened at Izbica.''
</P>
<P>
   As NATO strikes against Serb forces stretched into their ninth
week Wednesday, diplomatic efforts to end the conflict picked up
steam.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's envoy to the Balkans, former premier Victor
Chernomyrdin, met in Belgrade with Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic,
president of Yugoslavia, to discuss a possible end-game.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin was scheduled to return to Moscow on Thursday to
meet there with Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and
provide an update on Milosevic's latest thinking.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was
scheduled to discuss NATO's Kosovo strategy with British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the frantic shuttle diplomacy of recent weeks, Rubin
said a diplomatic breakthrough was not yet at hand, as Washington
and Moscow remain far apart over the key issue of how to put
together a credible international security force to police any
peace arrangement in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving towards agreement, not away from agreement,''
Rubin said. ``But clearly, there are major gaps that remain.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its NATO allies have insisted on a large,
combat-ready peacekeeping force with NATO at its core to police any
truce in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant
republic. Russia -- which has close historical and cultural ties to
its Slavic cousins in Serbia -- has pressed for a more lightly
armed force under United Nations command.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has said he would accept only a civilian monitoring
regime and he has so far ruled out the presence of NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that two months of air strikes are grinding away at
Serb unity, Rubin said the United States had verified that at least
500 Serb troops abandoned their units in Kosovo on Tuesday in the
single largest instance of Serb desertion to date.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said most of the deserters left Kosovo to return to their
homes in the town of Krusevac. Earlier this week, police in that
town cracked down on what U.S. officials have characterized as an
anti-war demonstration involving some 5,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The Krusevac authorities used heavy-handed tactics, including
attacks on women and children, to put down the demonstration, Rubin
said. U.S. intelligence sources believe that anger over those
actions prompted Tuesday's desertions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic's regime is beginning to crack,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's impossible to independently verify the State
Department's version of events inside Kosovo. Serb officials
expelled journalists from the province after NATO air strikes began
March 24.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare and horrifying glimpse at the bloodshed that's
unfolded inside the tiny province, however, the National
Albanian-American Council released a video Wednesday containing
gruesome footage of victims allegedly massacred in late March -- on
the 29th, according to some refugee accounts -- in the village of
Izbica.
</P>
<P>
   The village is one of more than 70 communities throughout Kosovo
where Serb troops, police or paramilitary gangs have executed
ethnic Albanians since NATO air strikes began, according to refugee
accounts deemed credible by the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Izbica) is only a small part of the story,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are normally not cameras when these massacres take
place,'' he said, ``but clearly, war crimes are being committed.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugees reaching Albania and Macedonia from Izbica in April
told human rights investigators that they were traveling through
the village in a convoy of tractors and farm trailers when they
were stopped by Serb police.
</P>
<P>
   Men -- most of whom ranged in age between 60 and 80 years --
were separated from women and children, according to the refugee
accounts, and forced to march off to a remote spot where a broad
field met a wooded slope.
</P>
<P>
   There these men -- 127, the State Department said -- were mowed
down by gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   On April 17, the United States released two-day-old intelligence
photos of Izbica showing three neat rows of graves that did not
exist in photos taken in early March.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, U.S. and NATO officials cited the photos as
evidence of a mass grave that supported the earlier refugee
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb government denounced the spy photos as a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   The video released Wednesday, however, shows civilians digging
graves with picks and shovels in an area whose terrain,
architecture and foliage matches identically with the features
illustrated by the intelligence imagery.
</P>
<P>
   The information is being turned over to the U.N. tribunal
investigating war crimes in Kosovo, and Rubin said it would weigh
heavily against the alleged perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have what we need, and what we think can provide a
compelling case,'' against Serb forces in Izbica, Rubin said.
``Ultimately that test will have to be met by the war crimes
tribunal.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin would not detail the source of the imagery, but U.S.
spyplanes and satellites have been heavily photographing Kosovo for
months.
</P>
<P>
   The grisly video released Wednesday showed victim after victim
-- some with badly contorted limbs, one with a hand that appeared
to have been shot nearly off and another with the contents of a
shattered skull seeping onto the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The victims wore the simple garb of traditional rural folk --
threadbare sweaters, loose-fitting trousers and heavy shoes deeply
creased by use -- and nothing even remotely resembling military
attire.
</P>
<P>
   In one scene, an elderly victim is placed in a grave, wrapped
only in a time-worn blanket, and dirt is shoveled onto the body.
</P>
<P>
   In footage at the scene of the alleged massacre, a white-haired
man describes the shooting. Serb police lined the men up in three
rows against the hillside and opened fire, said the man.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was on the last row, and as victims fell before him
he too fell to the ground. The man prostrated himself flat on the
ground, showing the camera how he lay still as bodies piled on top
of him. Then he crawled, like an animal, into the foliage,
demonstrating how he escaped after the Serb police had gone.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the man says that his own brother was killed, and he
breaks into uncontrollable sobs.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the video, rifle-bearing men in camouflaged
fatigues can be seen standing by as civilians dig graves. Rubin
said he assumed the military men were members of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, an ethnic Albanian group supporting independence
for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs regard the KLA as a terrorist group and have justified
their brutal campaign across Kosovo as an effort to destroy the
rebel organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't rule out that the KLA was there,'' said Rubin. That
would not excuse, though, the killing of elderly civilians, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A war crime is a war crime,'' Rubin said, ``and there is no
justification for a war crime.''

PICK UP STEAM

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The State Department showed spy photos Wednesday
that U.S. officials said prove the authenticity of a video-tape
documenting the alleged March massacre of 127 ethnic Albanian
civilians by Serb police in a village in northwest Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The video, shot by a refugee during a mass burial several days
after the alleged massacre at Izbica, contained graphic close-ups
of victims -- most of whom appeared to be elderly men -- whose
bloodied bodies, faces and clothing appeared to have been riddled
with bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav government has denied the attack and dismissed the
video as a fake.
</P>
<P>
   But the landscape, buildings and even trees seen in the video
match hand-in-glove with the features shown on U.S. spy photos of
the village, providing what State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin
called ``conclusive proof,'' that the video is authentic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time we've ever been able to link video
evidence with overhead imagery,'' Rubin told reporters after
presenting the intelligence photos and matching them with excerpts
from the video. ``The Serbs have lied to the world about what
happened at Izbica.''
</P>
<P>
   As NATO strikes against Serb forces stretched into their ninth
week Wednesday, diplomatic efforts to end the conflict picked up
steam.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's envoy to the Balkans, former premier Victor
Chernomyrdin, met in Belgrade with Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic,
president of Yugoslavia, to discuss a possible end-game.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin was scheduled to return to Moscow on Thursday to
meet there with Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and
provide an update on Milosevic's latest thinking.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was
scheduled to discuss NATO's Kosovo strategy with British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the frantic shuttle diplomacy of recent weeks, Rubin
said a diplomatic breakthrough was not yet at hand, as Washington
and Moscow remain far apart over the key issue of how to put
together a credible international security force to police any
peace arrangement in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving towards agreement, not away from agreement,''
Rubin said. ``But clearly, there are major gaps that remain.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its NATO allies have insisted on a large,
combat-ready peacekeeping force with NATO at its core to police any
truce in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant
republic. Russia -- which has close historical and cultural ties to
its Slavic cousins in Serbia -- has pressed for a more lightly
armed force under United Nations command.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has said he would accept only a civilian monitoring
regime and he has so far ruled out the presence of NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that two months of air strikes are grinding away at
Serb unity, Rubin said the United States had verified that at least
500 Serb troops abandoned their units in Kosovo on Tuesday in the
single largest instance of Serb desertion to date.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said most of the deserters left Kosovo to return to their
homes in the town of Krusevac. Earlier this week, police in that
town cracked down on what U.S. officials have characterized as an
anti-war demonstration involving some 5,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The Krusevac authorities used heavy-handed tactics, including
attacks on women and children, to put down the demonstration, Rubin
said. U.S. intelligence sources believe that anger over those
actions prompted Tuesday's desertions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic's regime is beginning to crack,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's impossible to independently verify the State
Department's version of events inside Kosovo. Serb officials
expelled journalists from the province after NATO air strikes began
March 24.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare and horrifying glimpse at the bloodshed that's
unfolded inside the tiny province, however, the National
Albanian-American Council released a video Wednesday containing
gruesome footage of victims allegedly massacred in late March -- on
the 29th, according to some refugee accounts -- in the village of
Izbica.
</P>
<P>
   The village is one of more than 70 communities throughout Kosovo
where Serb troops, police or paramilitary gangs have executed
ethnic Albanians since NATO air strikes began, according to refugee
accounts deemed credible by the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Izbica) is only a small part of the story,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are normally not cameras when these massacres take
place,'' he said, ``but clearly, war crimes are being committed.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugees reaching Albania and Macedonia from Izbica in April
told human rights investigators that they were traveling through
the village in a convoy of tractors and farm trailers when they
were stopped by Serb police.
</P>
<P>
   Men -- most of whom ranged in age between 60 and 80 years --
were separated from women and children, according to the refugee
accounts, and forced to march off to a remote spot where a broad
field met a wooded slope.
</P>
<P>
   There these men -- 127, the State Department said -- were mowed
down by gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   On April 17, the United States released two-day-old intelligence
photos of Izbica showing three neat rows of graves that did not
exist in photos taken in early March.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, U.S. and NATO officials cited the photos as
evidence of a mass grave that supported the earlier refugee
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb government denounced the spy photos as a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   The video released Wednesday, however, shows civilians digging
graves with picks and shovels in an area whose terrain,
architecture and foliage matches identically with the features
illustrated by the intelligence imagery.
</P>
<P>
   The information is being turned over to the U.N. tribunal
investigating war crimes in Kosovo, and Rubin said it would weigh
heavily against the alleged perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have what we need, and what we think can provide a
compelling case,'' against Serb forces in Izbica, Rubin said.
``Ultimately that test will have to be met by the war crimes
tribunal.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin would not detail the source of the imagery, but U.S.
spyplanes and satellites have been heavily photographing Kosovo for

 Providian Shares Fall 14% on News Of D.A.'s Probe
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Sam Zuckerman &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Shares of Providian Financial Corp. fell 14 percent yesterday
following reports that the giant San Francisco credit card lender
is under investigation by the city district attorney for possible
consumer fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Providian's stock plunged $17.19 to $106.94 in trading of 5.6
million shares, six times its average daily volume in the past six
months, after The Chronicle and KRON-TV reported the district
attorney's probe.
</P>
<P>
   Providian, the nation's ninth-largest credit card company,
specializes in lending to customers with flawed credit records.
</P>
<P>
   Before yesterday's plunge, Providian had been one of hottest
financial stocks on Wall Street, with shares more than doubling in
the last 18 months. Investors loved the company's knack for
extracting profits from customers other lenders regarded as
deadbeats.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Providian's stock was vulnerable precisely because
the company was such a high-flier, trading at prices much higher
than most financial stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Before yesterday's drop, the company's shares changed hands at
prices as high as 55 times earnings. By contrast, American Express
trades at about 25 times earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Chamberlain, an analyst with Jefferies &AMP; Co. in Los
Angeles, said it isn't clear an investigation will result in
sanctions that will affect Providian's profits. ``Still, if `20/20'
does an expose of them, then it's an investment issue,''
Chamberlain said.
</P>
<P>
   Prompted by complaints from consumers, the San Francisco
district attorney's office said Tuesday that it is looking into
whether Providian violated the law in the sale of credit cards and
collection of debt.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups have accused the company of such questionable
practices as failing to properly disclose fees and charges. The
company says that its actions are within the law and that it will
cooperate with any city investigation.

 Levi's Teaming Up With Goo Goo Dolls
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Carol Emert &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Can the Goo Goo Dolls convince teens to wear Levi's?
</P>
<P>
   Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. of San Francisco thinks they can. The
jeansmaker is expected to announce today that it will sponsor a
concert tour this summer featuring the rock bands Goo Goo Dolls,
Sugar Ray and Fastball.
</P>
<P>
   The Levi's Fuse '99 tour will cover 43 markets, including
Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View. Levi's, which has devoted
up to half of its marketing budget this year to rock music
sponsorships, plans to make the Fuse tour an annual event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to really create a positive association for
the Levi's brand with the most current, most exciting music,'' said
Joe Townsend, Levi's music sponsorship manager. ``I want our target
(audience) to come in and have a really fun time courtesy of the
Levi's brand. If we pull that off, we will have done a really good
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Levi's is hoping concert sponsorships will build a positive
association with teens _ something conventional advertising has
failed to do.
</P>
<P>
   But a local marketing executive said he is thinks teens may see
the tour as a heavy-handed sales job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Levi's needs to establish a brand identity that doesn't feel
like it's being sold,'' said the executive, who declined to be
identified because he does business with Levi's. ``They can't buy
brand loyalty in this age group.''
</P>
<P>
   A retailing executive said he doesn't expect the concerts to
help Levi's because he believes bad fashion forecasting is the
company's main problem. ``It's cool to sponsor a rock concert, but
do they have the items to sell?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's spokesman Jeff Beckman responded that sales for several
of the company's lines picked up in April.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Fuse tour, Levi's this summer is hosting
little-known rock groups at 35 outdoor amphitheaters around the
country on small stages, called Levi's First stages, built
specially for the acts.
</P>
<P>
   The Fuse events will start about 4:30 p.m. The afternoon will
include performances on the Levi's First stages in venues that have
them, and record-spinning by disc jockeys in a nearby tent. In the
evening, the three headline bands will play at the main
amphitheater.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's will offer performers clothing to wear but won't require
that they wear Levi's clothes, Townsend said. Levi's signs will not
appear on stage, but the Levi's name will be on tickets and on
posters around the venue.
</P>
<P>
   Townsend estimates 750,000 people will attend the Fuse concerts.
</P>
<P>
   The headline bands ``are not a sellout package,'' but will
attract a good-size crowd of young people, predicted one industry
source.

SINDEN COMMENTS ARBITRATION FODDER, KHRISTICH SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- From Harry Sinden's mouth to Dmitri Khristich's ears.
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour after the Bruins' season ended, Sinden, the
team's president and general manager, voiced his dissatisfaction
with some members of the team. The notable exception was Ray
Bourque. The notable targets were Khristich and Jason Allison.
Sinden called Khristich ``a total, total disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon at the FleetCenter, the normally reticent
Khristich went on the counterattack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't read it. I heard it,'' Khristich said. ``(Sinden)
just makes his ground for the arbitration. That's about it. No
normal person would say this the second day after a disappointing
loss, carve everybody. That's not how it's done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody on the team was feeling like we accomplished a lot
this season. We made one more step compared to the other season. We
learn from our mistakes and hopefully we do better next season.
With that kind of attitude, we woke (Wednesday) and saw that in the
newspaper. Maybe he's got a different idea. Maybe he's just
(thinking about) making money. Maybe he doesn't care about how
we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Khristich was awarded a one-year deal worth $1.95
million through arbitration. He likely will face the same
salary-setting process this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have to file till July 15,'' said Khristich's
agent, Larry Kelly, ``but rest assured we'll be filing.''
</P>
<P>
   If Khristich and the Bruins go to arbitration, the proceedings
promise to be contentious.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, arbitrator Claude Foisy split the difference between
what the right wing wanted and what the club was offering. After
watching Khristich's performance in the playoffs, the general
manager felt he did not get his money's worth. Sinden called the
three goals Khristich scored against Buffalo ``meaningless,''
adding that high-priced players were paid to produce in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Considering Sinden's comments and Khristich's counterattack, the
sides seem far apart in appraising Khristich's value. The general
manager's criticism could translate into a trade sometime around
the June draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like he's got confidence in me,'' said the
forward, who scored a team-high 29 goals and finished third in
assists with 42 during the regular season. ``I don't feel like even
going to arbitration because we will have totally different ideas
about what we're talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he wanted to be traded, Khristich said, ``I
wouldn't say that yet. That's just a first reaction. It's a long
summer and we'll see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   His agent was similarly noncommital on the subject of a trade,
adding only that he expected it to be a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Khristich's frustrations as a Bruin go beyond recent criticism
from the general manager. The right wing struggled through
stretches of unproductive play. He failed to score in the last five
games of the season and managed just 11 points (3 goals, 8 assists)
over the final 17. Khristich lacked consistency and regular
linemates, though he successfully reunited with Sergei Samsonov and
Allison midway through the Carolina series.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian deferred comment on his play in the postseason, but
admitted he would have liked more ice time. He finished with three
goals and four assists.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Khristich carries Sinden's words with him or dismisses
them as an emotional first reaction may depend on the success of
summertime negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know to (be critical before arbitration) money-wise,''
said Khristich. ``They know to put people down. I spent last year
in arbitration. I've been to the meeting of that arbitration itself
and I heard all the stuff they had to say about me. I was a little
surprised it came so early (this time), just the next morning after
the series. But I think I could predict what he would say and
that's what he was going to say.''
</P>
<P>
   When dissatisfied general managers and disgruntled players
speak, predictions are easy to make. Some expectations will be met
this offseason. Someone will walk away disappointed.

CONGRESS AND WHITE HOUSE TRY TO BREAK SOCIAL SECURITY DEADLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Neb., N.H., Iowa, Texas)   (bl)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bipartisan group of senators on Thursday will
propose a plan to deal with Social Security's looming problems
while there is tentative maneuvering at the White House and on
Capitol Hill to revive an issue that had seemed all but dead for
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the group of senators was polishing its plan, Rep. Bill
Archer, R- Texas, who heads the House Ways and Means Committee, met
with President Clinton on Wednesday to explore whether there was
enough common ground between the parties to move the issue forward.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said before the meeting with
Archer that the president ``wants to find a way to bring enough
Democrats and Republicans along so that we can solve this problem
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Archer agreed at the meeting that they would reach
out to congressional leaders, including Speaker Dennis Hastert of
Illinois and House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri, to
see if there was hope for serious negotiations. Archer also said he
would schedule hearings on Social Security next month, his
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The philosophical divide between the parties about how to deal
with Social Security remains deep, and there is so little trust
between Republicans and Democrats that the chances of a deal on
such a sensitive issue before the 2000 elections seem remote.
</P>
<P>
   But some members of both parties said they want to try.
</P>
<P>
   ``If nobody goes first, nobody goes anywhere,'' said Sen. John
Breaux, D-La., one of four senators who plan to unveil a
legislative proposal on Thursday. The others are Bob Kerrey,
D-Neb.; Judd Gregg, R-N.H., and Charles Grassley, R-Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Their plan is similar to previous proposals supported by members
of the group, and calls for private investment accounts within
Social Security that would be financed by a portion of the federal
budget surplus. Workers would place into the account each year a
tax rebate equal to two percentage points of the 12.4 percent
payroll tax that finances Social Security, and could choose from a
menu of investment options including stocks and Treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for an accelerating the planned increase in the
retirement age to 67 and a reduction in cost of living increases.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also has several new twists, among them a provision to
have the government match a portion of additional voluntary
contributions to the private accounts by low-income workers.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has two Democrats among its sponsors, the plan is
likely to be rejected by most Democrats, especially those in the
House, who are opposed to creating private accounts within the
retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   The plan's backers, though, said they hoped to create some
momentum by attracting enough support from members of both parties
to force a vote in the Senate Finance Committee, bring the bill to
the Senate floor and convince the leadership of both parties that
it is worth the political risk to insure the retirement system's
long-term health.

SEATTLE ART MUSEUM CANCELS EXHIBIT OF MIKE KELLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REGINA HACKETT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ ``Stand by Your Artist'' is not the Seattle Art
Museum's theme song. For the second time in a little more than a
year, the museum has agreed to exhibit an artist's work and backed
off at the prospect of controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Both times modern art curator Trevor Fairbrother chose the
artists, and both times he said he agreed with the decision to
renege. The first case concerned Seattle artist Erika Langley's
photos of strippers, and the second, occurring last week, concerns
a 1988 installation piece by Los Angeles artist Mike Kelley titled
``Pay for Your Pleasure.'' Kelley's piece was to be part of a group
exhibition, ``2000{,'' slated to open in July 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Kelley's, Langley's situation is insignificant.
Instead of canceling her show, the museum delayed it until it could
be hung in a gallery, deciding that its initial decision to place
the photos in a hallway was an error. School groups regularly tour
through the museum, Fairbrother explained at the time. If teachers
see a warning label on a gallery, they might choose not to enter,
but in a hallway show, the option isn't available.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley's piece was canceled, and canceled after Fairbrother got
a go-ahead from museum director Mimi Gates and told the artist he
was on board.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley is one of the most distinguished artists in his
generation on the West Coast. ``Pay for Your Pleasure'' has been
exhibited without notable protest at New York's Whitney Museum of
American Art, the Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago
and the Los Angeles Museum of Modern Art, which owns the piece.
</P>
<P>
   The problem in Seattle, Fairbrother said, is that protests came
in so far in advance of the exhibiton that the museum didn't have
time to present the reasons it wanted to show it. Gates wasn't
available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   First reactions came via the Internet. After hearing the museum
was looking for a piece of art by a criminal, a reporter working
for the Web site of the ``APB Serial Killer Bureau'' called
victims' groups and told them the museum planned to exhibit art by
a murderer and asked them what they thought.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Eakes, member of the museum and founder/president of the
Seattle-based Mothers Against Violence in America, said local talk
radio hosts called her and presented a one-sided view of the
controversy. ``I was told the museum planned to feature the work of
a killer,'' she said. While she is impressed the museum made such a
fast decision to cancel the show, she said she would like to hear
more about the exhibit and what the artist's perspective is. ``I'd
be willing to work with the museum to explore the issue. The media
presented (the artwork) as today's outrage. There should be a
complete discussion before ruling it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Fairbrother also blames the media. ``The press created a feeding
frenzy and so distorted the idea of Mike's piece that we had no
choice,'' he said. ``Both Mimi and I agreed to make this decision
for the good of the institution. In this climate, the piece
wouldn't have a chance of being fairly viewed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pay for Your Pleasure'' is essentially a corridor along which
banners hang featuring the faces of famed philosophers and artists
in the Western tradition, from early Greeks to 19th-century poets,
along with quotes from each that flirt with the idea of the rule
breaker and the criminal.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the corridor is a painting by a criminal active in
the region. Hence, when ``Pay for Your Pleasure'' was in Chicago,
it included a crude painting of a clown by mass murderer John Wayne
Gacy. Had ``Pay for Your Pleasure'' opened at SAM, a painting by a
local criminal would have been used. Kelley's intent is to
juxtapose theory and fact, romance and reality, thus raising
questions about why violence is romanticized.
</P>
<P>
   David Beatty, director of public policy for the National Center
for Victims of Crime, in Arlington, Va., expressed regret in the
Serial Killer Bureau online article that criminals are glamorized
for their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, however, he said the reporter calling him didn't
explain the artwork but said the museum was going to feature work
of an infamous criminal. The reporter ``didn't tell me what the
artist was doing,'' he said. ``I told her, not having seen the
context or the specific presentation, I couldn't make specific
comments. With art, you have to see it first.'' That quote didn't
make it into the online story.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet article was faxed to Seattle's ABC affiliate, The
Seattle Times. The Times editorialized last Friday on the subject,
asking why the museum couldn't also exhibit the work of crime
victims. After talk radio stations began to log in, the museum
canceled the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if any of the people complaining had seen Kelley's piece,
Fairbrother shook his head. ``It didn't seem so,'' he said. He
added that timing was another crucial issue, since the subject of
violence is particularly sensitive after the slaying of high school
students in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Andrews, director of the University of Washington's
Henry Art Gallery, agreed. ``There's national anguish after
Littleton,'' he said. ``I understand that. I'm the father of a
16-year-old boy. On the other hand, what better time for a piece
that explores the nature of violence? The issue is intolerably
double-edged.''
</P>
<P>
   Susanne Ghez, director of the Renaissance Society at the
University of Chicago, said controversies of this sort distort art
and everybody loses. ``Kelley isn't rewarding criminals or
increasing their fame. He's framing a discussion in an aesthetic
context.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Reid, a Seattle curator and writer who has both written
about and exhibited Kelley, thinks the artist has been given the
art world equivalent of the bum's rush. ``Who needs Jesse Helms
when we have the Seattle Art Museum?'' he asked. ``Did the museum
make any effort to educate the public about this work? No. If the
museum doesn't have the guts to stand behind a strong work of art
when the squeeze is on, then it should go on pretending the 20th
century never happened. Seattle's not ready for Mike Kelley? What
are we, the wimp town of all time?''
</P>
<P>
   Helene Winer, co-director of Metro Pictures, Kelley's New York
gallery, said the artist is disappointed but doesn't want talk to
the press and be dragged into a controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say I'm against museums withdrawing shows based on
uninformed protests,'' she said. ``There is no argument about this
piece. It's very anti-violence and very clear about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Robin Held, acting director of Seattle's Center on Contemporary
Art, said CoCA is working on the possibility of showing Kelley's
piece but can't say anything for certain. ``We'd be honored to do
it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle gallery director Greg Kucera, who saw ``Pay for Your
Pleasure'' in Los Angeles, recalls it as a ``magnificent'' work.
``Kelley has the bad habit of getting under people's skins and God
bless him for it.''

 &HT;    Newsstands offering plenty of stock advice
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Anybody looking for inexpensive but professional
advice need look no further than the newsstand in the next few
weeks. No fewer than five magazines devote cover stories to what
stocks and mutual funds to buy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Money (June) features its second annual Money 100 list of
``outstanding mutual funds that any investor can use to build a
smart, well-balanced portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine (June) looks at
individual stocks, offering suggestions for three kinds of
portfolios _ ``conservative, aggressive and in-between.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Bloomberg Personal Finance (June) takes a different tack,
examining Wall Street's ``most loved and most hated stocks,'' and
``how savvy investors can play both lists.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Individual Investor (June) considers whether it is time to buy
``the comeback companies'' _ such as General Motors, AT&AMP;T, Seagram,
Kmart, Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mutual Funds (June) surveys mutual funds designed to ``beat
the Dow,'' but also looks at tech stocks and the new Roth IRA.
</P>
<P>
   And as a service to those who would like to do their own
trading, Business Week (May 24) is out with its guide to buying and
selling via the Internet, which it says is ``rapidly changing the
way we invest.''
</P>
<P>
   My kind of town
</P>
<P>
   Take your pick, wealthy neighbors or working neighbors. This is
what two business publications do in their annual surveys of
cities: the 250 richest towns in America, by Worth (June), and the
16 best places for business and careers by Forbes (May 31).
</P>
<P>
   No, none of the richest towns is in Georgia. The closest, and
also top-ranked, is Jupiter Island, Fla., where the median home
price is $1.7 million. Worth says six of the top 10 cities are in
California and the other three are in Colorado _ can you spell
Aspen?
</P>
<P>
   If you're not affluent enough to live in a rich town, check out
Forbes' 50 best cities to get a job. Seattle ranks first and
Atlanta 10th, with the usual suspects in between: Austin, Texas;
Dallas, Ventura, San Jose and Oakland, Calif.; Somerset, N.J.;
Denver; and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   What's money for, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   If consumer spending is what keeps the U.S. economy going,
there's every reason to think it will go for a long time, according
to U.S. News &AMP; World Report (May 24). A booming economy is making
most Americans wealthier, and spending, it seems, begets spending.
</P>
<P>
   Strategy &AMP; Business (second quarter), an upscale business
quarterly, takes this concept a step further and suggests that the
consumption of consumer goods in so-called emerging markets over
the next 10 to 15 years will rival spending by consumers in the
United States and other industrial nations. Companies such as
Coca-Cola and Colgate-Palmolive are already ahead in this emerging
market game, the magazine says.

 &HT;    3 major firms remove Charter from referrals
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Three major managed care networks, totaling 32 million
members, suspended patient referrals to Charter Behavioral Health
Systems' psychiatric hospitals, in the wake of a critical CBS News
report on suburban Atlanta-based Charter's facilities.
</P>
<P>
   MCC Behavioral Care, which covers 10 million members, United
Behavioral Health, with 13 million, and Managed Health Network,
with 9 million, each said Wednesday that they were conducting
investigations of Charter as a result of the ``60 Minutes II''
program last month.
</P>
<P>
   The segment, anchored by Ed Bradley, alleged dangerous
conditions, falsification of records and lack of employee training
in Charter psychiatric hospitals. The allegations included injuries
and two patient deaths. The program followed a yearlong CBS News
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Charter, which runs the largest U.S. chain of private
psychiatric hospitals, responded to the program with an
investigation of its own. The company denies systemwide problems.
</P>
<P>
   But even the part-owner of Charter, Atlanta-based Magellan
Health Services, suspended referrals to two Charter facilities in
North Carolina cited in the ``60 Minutes II'' program. Magellan _
the No. 1 behavioral health company with 64 million members _ has
conducted its own reviews of Charter hospitals. It recently resumed
referrals to one suspended hospital, in Greensboro.
</P>
<P>
   Removing Charter from referrals could cause access problems in
some rural areas where the company is the sole provider, said Mary
Graham of the National Mental Health Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on the community,'' she said. Major urban areas,
such as metro Atlanta, have alternatives to Charter, including
independent facilities and psychiatric services offered by general
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The three companies suspending referrals are among the top five
managed care firms that specialize in delivering mental health and
substance abuse services to insurers and employers. MCC is a
subsidiary of Cigna HealthCare, and UBH is a unit of United
Healthcare.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people reviewing their operations, training records _
all aspects of patient care,'' said MCC spokesman Howard Drescher,
adding that the company has resumed referrals to most Charter
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The Charter suspensions led MCC to make contingency plans to
send patients to other hospitals, Drescher added. ``In some
locations, Charter is the only facility _ or almost the only one _
to give these services,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The privately held Charter operates 91 facilities in 32 states.
Eleven are in Georgia, with six in metro Atlanta. Annual revenue
exceeds $700 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``MCC and UBH are doing audits, and as far as I know, the
reviews have been favorable,'' Karen Jenkins, a Charter
spokeswoman, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 2 behavioral health company, Value Options, said it
reviewed its Charter care but did not suspend referrals.
</P>
<P>
   California-based Managed Health Network stopped its Charter
referrals the day after the ``60 Minutes II'' program aired. It has
launched its own investigation, which includes site visits to
Charter hospitals, said Lisa Haines, a company spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just taking precautions,'' she said. ``We want to make
sure our members are in the best place to receive services.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Magellan tried to sell its stake in Charter to the
other 50 percent owner, Crescent Operating. That deal collapsed.
And Magellan still has its ownership on the block.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Office of Inspector General, which fights health
care fraud, is reviewing the allegations against Charter.
</P>
<P>
   A recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission by
Magellan said the OIG, the Department of Justice and other agencies
are conducting investigations of Charter facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Charter is trying to clean up its act,'' said Al Guida
of the National Mental Health Association. The quality of care in
private hospitals such as Charter's is better than that in a
state-run institution, Guida added.
</P>
<P>
   But parents should actively monitor the care of their children
in any hospital, Guida said.
</P>
<P>
   He condemned the broad use of physical restraints on psychiatric
patients, in Charter and other facilities. The CBS program began
with the case of a 16-year-old boy who died in restraints at
Charter's Greensboro hospital. Congress is studying legislation
aimed at limiting the use of restraints.
</P>
<P>
   Charter has questioned CBS' reporting tactics, which included
footage shot by a hidden camera worn by a social worker who worked
for eight weeks in a Charter hospital. Charter cited patient
confidentiality concerns in filing a motion for a temporary
restraining order to prevent the program from airing.

 &HT;    Power shift: Executive moves up at Southern
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Allen Franklin's appointment as Southern Co. president
is a major step in repositioning the company to compete in a
deregulated electric power industry.
</P>
<P>
   But the move leaves open the question of who will eventually
succeed A.W. ``Bill'' Dahlberg as chairman and chief executive
officer of the nation's largest power producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a period of time when the industry is going to change
pretty rapidly,'' Dahlberg said Wednesday after elevating Franklin,
president of Georgia Power Co., to Southern's No. 2 post.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to stay ahead of it, rather than try to catch up to
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Southern announced that Franklin, Dahlberg's close
associate of two decades, would become president and chief
operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   David M. Ratcliffe, chief financial officer at Georgia Power,
will succeed Franklin as president and chief executive officer of
Southern's largest subsidiary. Both appointments are effective June
1.
</P>
<P>
   Dahlberg is turning over to Franklin the day-to-day operations
of Southern's five U.S. utilities: Georgia Power, Alabama Power,
Gulf Power in northern Florida, Mississippi Power and Savannah
Electric.
</P>
<P>
   An engineer by training, Franklin will also oversee Southern's
electric power generation unit.
</P>
<P>
   Dahlberg, who has held three titles of chairman, president and
chief executive since 1995, will now have more time to plot
strategy for his $11.4 billion-a-year company, which has operations
across the United States and around the world.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Franklin will be essential to preparing Southern
for the coming shake-up in the $200 billion-a-year electric utility
industry. Deregulation will inject competition into what has been a
monopoly enterprise, much like it has for telecommunications, the
airline and Georgia's natural gas industries.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin has been Southern's point man for deregulation and has
represented the electric utility industry in testimony on Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Kuhn, president of the Edison Electric Institute, the
Washington-based utility industry trade group, called Franklin the
industry's ``principal leader'' in formulating strategy as chairman
of the group's restructuring committee.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin ``probably knows more about the proposals than anyone
in our industry,'' Dahlberg added.
</P>
<P>
   But Dahlberg said Franklin was not being designated as his
successor at this time.
</P>
<P>
   Succession challenge
</P>
<P>
   The process of selecting a Southern Co. CEO has been compared to
the anointment of a new pope by the Vatican's College of Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   When Dahlberg was named president in 1994, it was clear he would
eventually succeed Edward L. Addison as chief executive. The same
was true 10 years earlier when Addison was named as heir-apparent
to Alvin W. Vogtle Jr.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no puff of smoke rising from Southern's Peachtree
Street headquarters Wednesday. The announcement was made after the
boards of Southern and Georgia Power approved Dahlberg's decision,
and in advance of next week's Southern shareholder meeting in
Birmingham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, we've used the position of president as a
transition job. This is different,'' Dahlberg said, noting that
Franklin will also serve as the first chief operating officer in
Southern's history, a ``full-time job.''
</P>
<P>
   That role needed to be filled, he said, because of the growth of
Southern's Southeastern utilities, which now have 3.3 million
customers, and the increasing complexity of the utility business.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin will take a hands-on role in shaping Southern's
strategy as the utility industry moves toward separate generation,
transmission and distribution functions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need a president,'' agreed Edward J. Tirello, an analyst
with BT Alex. Brown. ``As the company expands, you need more top
management and someone who could be chosen as a successor if
something happens to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Dahlberg and Franklin are relatively close in age. Dahlberg is
59, and Franklin, 54. If Dahlberg serves through mandatory
retirement at 65, that would leave five years for Franklin to serve
until his own retirement.
</P>
<P>
   But Franklin could be a transitional figure in that role,
according to industry observers.
</P>
<P>
   A new crop of leaders is waiting in the wings, most notably Tom
Boren, 49, president of Southern Energy Inc., which oversees
Southern's growing unregulated businesses inside the United States
and in Europe, Asia and South America. Those operations have just
taken off in the last several years.
</P>
<P>
   Southern projects that the unregulated businesses overseen by
Boren will account for 30 percent of the company's profits by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   But Boren's future prospects could depend on the continued
success of ventures that are inherently more risky than the
regulated utilities that will no doubt continue to account for most
of Southern's profits.
</P>
<P>
   Boren was promoted Wednesday to the additional title of Southern
executive vice president, and it was made clear he will continue to
report directly to Dahlberg, not Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   Other up-and-comers include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ratcliffe, 50, whose new job at the helm of Georgia Power is a
traditional steppingstone.
</P>
<P>
   _ G. Edison Holland, 46, president of Savannah Electric.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dwight A. Evans, 50, president of Mississippi Power.
</P>
<P>
   _ Paul J. DeNicola, 50, president of Southern Company Services,
the company's engineering arm.
</P>
<P>
   But Dahlberg said he has ``no idea'' who will succeed him.
``It's premature to think about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Southern's stock closed
Wednesday at $27.75, up 31 1/4 cents.

 &HT;    Banks will be prepared, safe, industry officials say
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The safest place to keep your money during the early
days of 2000 won't be under your mattress or in that old shoe box
hidden in the back of the closet.
</P>
<P>
   It will be your bank.
</P>
<P>
   An overwhelming majority of the nation's banks and financial
institutions are prepared to handle business on and after Jan. 1,
2000, banking industry officials said during a news briefing on Y2K
readiness Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Spoth, deputy regional director of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. in Atlanta, called Y2K preparedness a ``top
priority'' for the industry. He said the FDIC and other industry
groups have been working for years on plans to avoid major
disruptions in service. Since last March, every FDIC-insured
institution has been examined at least twice for Y2K compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We give you an assurance that if your money is in a
FDIC-insured account, it is safe,'' he said. ``We do not expect
prolonged computer glitches that will prevent customers from
getting access to their money. There are few guarantees in life,
but the FDIC is one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   By June 30, Spoth said, there will be a complete testing and
inspection of computer systems at FDIC-insured institutions. They
must have detailed contingency plans in place in the event of
problems.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, preparations are ``right on track,'' said Steve
Bridges of the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance, which
oversees most of the state's financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   As of May 15, he added, no Georgia banks were found
unsatisfactory.
</P>
<P>
   But consumers must also do their part, the experts said,
including:
</P>
<P>
   _ Stay informed and read all the Y2K information your bank sends
you.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you have questions, ask a bank official.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you bank online, make sure your computer is Y2K compliant.
Make records of your accounts on a backup disk.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you have direct deposit, check with your employer about its
Y2K readiness.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep your bank statements and records of transactions.
</P>
<P>
   _ During the date change, take out as much cash as you would for
any holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
   _ Be on the watch for scams and avoid giving out account
information over the phone.

OFFICER BOASTED OF TORTURING LOUIMA, WITNESS TESTIFIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: 2nd take to move within 30 minutes.) 
(sw) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In surprise testimony that riveted jurors and
spectators, a police sergeant testified on Wednesday that the
officer accused of torturing Abner Louima boasted to him that he
had carried out the attack in a Brooklyn police station restroom.
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant, Kenneth Wernick, said that Officer Justin A. Volpe
had taken him into the restroom and shown him a stick that Volpe
claimed he had rammed into Louima's rectum. Later, in another area
of the 70th Precinct station house in Brooklyn, Wernick said he
watched as Volpe pointed the stick at another officer's face and
said, ``Smell this. Smell this.''
</P>
<P>
   Wernick said Volpe then pointed the stick at him and demanded to
know if he could see feces on it. The sergeant testified in federal
District Court in Brooklyn that he saw nothing on the stick, which
he said was two to three feet long.
</P>
<P>
   Wernick's testimony, his first public account of the events, was
the most direct testimony yet linking Volpe to a reported act of
police torture that shocked the city.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking rapidly in loud tones, Wernick told of a conversation
with Volpe that took place after dawn on Aug. 9, 1997, shortly
after prosecutors say Louima was attacked with the stick by Volpe
while another officer on trial, Charles Schwarz, held him down.
</P>
<P>
   Louima, a 32-year-old Haitian immigrant, had been arrested in a
street melee outside a nightclub in the Flatbush section of
Brooklyn, and prosecutors say Volpe mistakenly thought Louima had
punched him in the disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   Wernick, who held the rank of officer at the time and is now
assigned to the Fifth Precinct in Manhattan, said the conversation
started with Volpe's telling him, ``I took a man down tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he took a stick and put it five or six inches'' into
Louima's rectum, Wernick testified, ``and took it out and put it by
his mouth and teeth area, kind of like he was showing it to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant said Volpe continued his account by saying that he
had hit Louima on the genitals and that he had ``held his hand over
his mouth and told him if he told anybody, he'd kill him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You want to go into the bathroom and see the stick?'
'' the sergeant testified as Volpe, at the defense table,
alternated between watching him without expression, shaking his
head and writing in a notebook. Wernick said he last saw Volpe
holding the stick outside the station house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We walked outside by a large Dumpster and he held up the
stick,'' said Wernick, a burly, gray-haired man, holding up his
left arm to show how Volpe was holding the stick, as he sat on the
witness stand next to Judge Eugene H. Nickerson's bench. He did not
say what Volpe did at that point with the stick, which has never
been found.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked away,'' the sergeant continued. ``I didn't want to be
involved at any point.''
</P>
<P>
   But earlier in his account, when Alan Vinegrad, an assistant
U.S. attorney, asked the sergeant whether he had believed that
Volpe had committed the torture, the sergeant said he had not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' Vinegrad asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, because I didn't think anybody would do it,''
Wernick replied. ``And if they did it, they wouldn't talk about
it.''

TEMPERS FLARE AS SENATE TABLES BILL TO PROVIDE MORE SCHOOL
COUNSELORS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate set aside a measure Wednesday that would
have funded the hiring of more school counselors in wake of school
violence in Littleton, Colo., as lawmakers worked to wrap up
consideration of a major juvenile-crime bill that includes
controversial gun-control measures.
</P>
<P>
   The vote of 61-38 to table the measure, offered by Sen. Paul
Wellstone, D-Minn., followed an angry exchange between Wellstone
and Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, in which they
accused each other of not being serious about addressing school
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone's amendment, which called for spending up to $340
million to begin hiring thousands of school counselors in an
attempt to head off potential violence, drew an angry response from
Hatch, who accused his Minnesota colleague of offering the
amendment ``just to delay'' a final vote on the juvenile-crime
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, chief sponsor of the larger crime bill, also labeled the
Wellstone measure as little more than an attempt to ``throw money''
at a problem that can't be addressed properly by simply hiring more
counselors to deal with troubled youth in the nation's public
school system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I resent the accusation that this is taking up time and
delaying this bill,'' Wellstone bristled. He went on to accuse
Hatch of being unwilling to address the problem of troubled youth
who may not have access to qualified counselors in their schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need to be lectured by the senator from Minnesota
whose answer to everything is to throw money at it,'' Hatch shot
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very relevant to what we need to do to help kids
before they get into trouble,'' Wellstone continued. ``I'm
surprised that with all (Hatch's) good work (on other issues
related to helping troubled children) that he doesn't understand
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange, which verged on a shouting match between the two,
illustrated just how tense the debate over juvenile crime, and
especially gun-control issues, has become in the Senate as
lawmakers try to address the public outrage over the shooting and
bombing incident at Columbine High School last month that left 14
students and one teacher dead.
</P>
<P>
   The debate on gun-control matters also continued Wednesday as
Democrats sought to force a vote on an amendment that would close
what they contend are loopholes in a Republican bill passed last
week. That bill called for some buyer background checks at gun
shows. Democrats contend that the bill, which limits the check to
24 hours, really amounts to no check at all, and would allow
criminals to purchase guns on Saturday and pick them up on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a gun show on Saturday and you only have a 24-hour
check, guess what? There's no check at all,'' Sen. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y., told his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said the Republican amendment adopted last week
resembled ``an elaborate Kabuki dance to make it look we're doing
something'' on gun control ``when we're really not.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic amendment would extend the waiting period on guns
bought at gun shows and pawnshops to at least three days.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., and other opponents argued that
the proposal would allow the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms to impose a records-check fee on gun purchasers.
</P>
<P>
   A vote on the amendment is expected today or Friday if senators
hold to an agreement to limit debate on other measures.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bickering over gun control and the Wellstone
measure, the senators did agree by voice vote to create a national
Commission on Character Development to study the impact of cultural
influences on violence.
</P>
<P>
   The commission will be made up of 36 members, whose job it will
be to present Congress with a list of recommendations in two years
that could lead to legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The measure creating the commission was sponsored by Republicans
who have been trying to turn the focus of the juvenile crime bill
away from gun control to questions about the impact of cultural
influences on youth.

TIME FOR BRUINS MANAGEMENT TO REVIEW ITS GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not all about Jason Allison and Dmitri Khristich.
</P>
<P>
   It's not all about the lack of moves in the front office and the
stranglehold on the payroll purse strings.
</P>
<P>
   It's not all about a team that appeared to lose the message the
coach was preaching, too often stood around like so many deer
caught in the headlights, allowing the Sabres to run over them.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Bruins closed shop Tuesday night because of all
those things, and for the next five months we get to see how, or
if, Mssrs. Harry Sinden and Mike O'Connell respond to all of it.
</P>
<P>
   Sinden immediately and predictably opened up the blame game
after the 3-2 loss in Buffalo, putting the finger on Allison and
Khrisitch for their postseason shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   He was right to the point.
</P>
<P>
   But he was right, only to a point.
</P>
<P>
   Khristich was abysmal, from the opening faceoff of Round 1. The
irony in Sinden's late-night lambasting is that it was Sinden who
telephoned Pat Burns, according to the coach, and encouraged him to
keep Khristich in the lineup when some in the media _ including
your faithful correspondent _ opined that Khristich should be given
the hook early in Round 1. Khristich not only kept his job, but he
was temporarily reunited with Allison as his center and Sergei
Samsonov on the other wing. He remained an empty sweater.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the stats show, no matter what he says,
Khristich's performance was indifferent and a debilitating drag on
the team as a whole. He showed some interest in contributing
defensively, but he was a non-factor when it came to making plays,
fighting for the puck (puleeeez), or even shooting. Sinden's torch
job guarantees that Khristich's 29 goals can be deleted from next
season's roster.
</P>
<P>
   The bet here: they'll trade Khristich's negotiating rights, even
prior to an arbitration hearing. The nightmare only could grow
worse if an arbitrator awarded him, say, $3 million _ a bump of
more than $1 million over his 1998-99 pay. What club would want him
then? The Bruins would be in the position of letting him go for
nothing _ exercising walkaway free agency _ and then they'd have
lost an asset, admittedly a dwindling asset, for nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   As for Allison, his postseason was a disappointment. He by no
means took a step toward becoming Boston's Bryan Trottier or Mark
Messier, the knighted center in charge of the offense. But he did
have a bothersome wrist (a lingering injury from late in the
regular season) and he also had, at various times over 12 playoff
games, Khristich as one of his wingers. When Allison was at his
best this season, it was typically when Khristich looked as if he
cared to play, got involved, became a factor.
</P>
<P>
   How effective could Allison be with Khristich in hibernation and
the diminutive Samsonov essentially his only wingman? To find that
answer, go try hanging a laundered shirt on the clothesline,
without using your hands. Like the results?
</P>
<P>
   Turning both Khristich and Allison into the sacrificial lambs is
a deceptive slaughter. To repeat what we've said here a number of
times: there just aren't enough bodies to get the job done. And
that's OK. This is a team that went rotten in the patch only two
years ago for all the reasons we've stated before: bad trades; the
failure to pay some roster players who became free agents;
unfortunate injuries; loading up with old guys; replacing `B'
players who commanded `A' money with `C' and `D' players who
commanded `D' and `F' money (i.e. cashiering Shawn McEachern for
Trent McCleary).
</P>
<P>
   To recover from that mess and get in the playoffs last season
was very impressive. To win a round this year was another important
building block. Five years after winning their last series, it
provided some of the players, the majority of whom weren't here in
'94, with some validation. Ditto for the fans, who never stop the
crusade down Causeway, no matter where the team finishes. Bruins
fans deserve their pavilion in the Fans Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Did anyone truly expect the Bruins, as presently constituted, to
make it to the Eastern Conference championships this spring? If so,
they weren't realistic in their roster-wide assessment of talent.
For instance, Allison could have had a great series and there still
probably wouldn't have been enough to move to the next round. It
wasn't like the Joe Thornton line took charge. And the Rob
DiMaio-Tim Taylor-P.J. Axelsson line is a gritty, courageous trio,
but checking lines alone don't win championships, they provide a
base for the bigger, more talented lines to get the work done.
</P>
<P>
   Sinden and O'Connell will be forced to spend this summer,
especially to keep Byron Dafoe, who will come in asking a minimum
of $3 million-plus a season. Taylor can walk as an unrestricted
free agent and, as such, likely will command a three-year deal
worth upwards of $5 million. If the franchise learned anything from
letting Dave Poulin and, to a lesser extent, Dave Reid get away,
then Taylor will get the dough. If not, he'll be somewhere else by
mid-July. The bet here: he'll take a hometown discount worth
slightly below $4 million over three years.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond spending to keep the necessary parts intact, Sinden and
O'Connell have to add to the depth up front and in back. This is a
team that is at least four legitimate NHLers away from getting real
in the playoffs. Perhaps one will come from college or the minors.
Maybe they can deal for another. On top of that, they should spend
to bring in some free agents, something they steadfastly refused to
do last summer and again at the March trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Management's refusal to beef up the lineup, via trades or
free-agent acquisitions, was equally as defeating as Allison's poor
showing. In fact, it was more defeating. To lambaste Allison for
the eventual collapse only underscores to the rest of the roster,
and anyone else who might consider coming here as a free agent,
that ultimately everything is the players' fault. Now there's a
vibrant workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most troubling of all in Round 2 was not the losing, per
se, but how the club lost. There were dead spots, not just in
talent, but in emotion. After a rousing Game 1 against the Sabres,
they came out with a stinker in Game 2. Two nights later, after two
strong periods, they again went dead in the third period, blew a
2-1 lead, and then played like emotionless zombies in Game 4.
Another rousing performance in Game 5 (at least for 40 minutes),
was followed by another near total dud in Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that erraticism has to be traced to coaching. Either the
players weren't heeding Burns's message _ be it because they
stopped listening, they choked, or were just too beaten up _ or the
right message wasn't being sent. It could be a blend of all that.
The bet here: when the aches and pains began to suffocate them,
they stopped listening. Burns can be faulted for not finding a way
to fire them up, get them over the mental block, but a coach has
only so many tricks, so many devices. He teased it out of them for
Game 5. Two nights later, they looked and played as if beyond his
reach.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting, Scott Bowman's quote Wednesday in USA Today, after
his Red Wings were eliminated by the Avalanche Tuesday night: ``A
coach can't hide behind the fact that some players didn't play as
well as they could have because that's his job (to motivate
them).''
</P>
<P>
   If this group has stopped listening to Burns, we won't know that
until next season. By then, of course, there undoubtedly will be a
mix of some 30 percent new faces in the lineup, most everyone will
be healed, and he'll have a chance to recapture and take command.
For whatever reason, they didn't respond to him the last two weeks
the way they did over the last month of the regular season and the
first round of the postseason. They lost their pluck. Burns
couldn't get them to regain it.
</P>
<P>
   Did any other Bruin play like Ray Bourque, with his passion, his
will to win, his steadfast refusal to retaliate to some awful cheap
shots? Of course not. To ask anyone to play like Bourque, which is
what Sinden asked, is not realistic. It's unfair to Bourque and
unfair to his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque is a Hall of Famer, and there are very few of those, and
fewer all the time in this era that emphasizes skill and point
production over the basic courage it takes to play the game. The
day he retires, perhaps a year from now, it would be only fitting
that Bourque gets his own parade through the city's streets, a
Stanley Cup-like parade for someone who so richly deserves to have
his name on hockey's greatest team honor.
</P>
<P>
   When Sinden and O'Connell begin to perform their jobs the way
Bourque performs his _ in constant pursuit of perfection, never
putting the knock on management, the coaching staff, teammates, or
media _ then Boston once more truly will be the Hub of Hockey.

SETTLEMENT IS REPORTEDLY NEAR IN VITAMIN PRICE-FIXING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Justice Department is expected to announce shortly that at
least two of the world's largest drug and chemical companies have
agreed to pay as much as $700 million to settle criminal charges
that they participated in a global conspiracy to fix prices in the
sale of vitamins, according to people close to the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   In what would be the largest settlement ever in a federal
anti-trust case, Roche Holding A.G. of Switzerland and BASF A.G. of
Germany are expected to plead guilty to charges that they were part
of a global conspiracy to set prices and divide up the world market
in animal and human vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   While the negotiations with the government could break down,
people close to the negotiations said that the case is expected to
be resolved as early as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Roche Holdings is expected to pay as much as $500 million to
settle the case and BASF is expected to pay about $200 million,
according to people who have been briefed on the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Rhone-Poulenc of France has been under investigation but is not
expected to be fined, partly because executives there are
cooperating with federal investigators, people close to the
negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman at the Justice Department refused to comment
Wednesday on the prospect of an upcoming settlement. And
spokespersons for the three companies would only say that they are
cooperating with federal investigators and seeking to resolve the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We refuse to confirm or deny any speculation regarding a
settlement,'' said John Gilardi, a spokesman at BASF in Germany.
``We are cooperating with the Justice Department investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Roche and Rhone-Poulenc issued similar statements.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury in Dallas has been probing price-fixing
allegations in the vitamin market for more than a year and criminal
indictments are expected to be handed up as soon as Thursday,
according to people close to the settlement. Several executives
could also be charged.
</P>
<P>
   A number of class-action lawsuits have also been filed against
the European companies, alleging that over the past decade,
executives at the three largest vitamin manufacturers _ Roche, BASF
and Rhone-Poulenc _ and several smaller manufacturers and vitamin
blenders, met secretly and agreed to fix prices and carve up
territories in the United States and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Silver, an attorney at Boies &AMP; Schiller in Armonk, N.Y.,
said his firm filed one of the earliest class-action suits in 1998,
and then filed several more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lawsuits have alleged illegal conduct by an international
cartel that deliberately targeted and severely burdened consumers
in the United States,'' he said in an interview yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not a settlement takes place, federal prosecutors and
a number of class-action lawsuits have charged a massive global
conspiracy that involved fixing prices of the sale of such common
vitamins as vitamin A, C and E, as well as niacin and other B
complex vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   The cases involve everyday vitamins that are sold in
supermarkets and drugstores as well as the bulk sale of vitamins
that are fed to animals to produce a leaner and more healthy stock.
</P>
<P>
   The federal investigation into collusion in the vitamin market
is considered one of the most important anti-trust cases under
review by the Justice Department. Just months ago, Joel I. Klein,
the assistant attorney general in charge of the anti-trust
division, said: ``Our investigation into worldwide conspiracies
involving vitamins is continuing. Those conspiracies have affected
billions of dollars of commerce in products found in nearly every
American household.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last March, Lonza AG, a Swiss vitamin manufacturer, and five
executives at other companies pleaded guilty to price-fixing in the
vitamin market and agreed to cooperate with the Justice Department
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Lonza, a much smaller player that specializes in B-complex
vitamins, agreed to pay $10.5 million to settle price-fixing
charges brought by the anti-trust division of the Justice
Department. In that case, the government alleged that between 1992
and 1998, Lonza officials met and exchanged sales and customer
information and colluded to set prices for vitamins in the
B-complex group.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, executives at Chinook Group, a Canadian
company and DuCoa, a company formed as a joint venture between
Dupont and Conagra, pleaded guilty to charges that they conspired
to fix the prices of animal and human vitamins and divided up
markets in the U.S. and elsewhere. Those executives could be hit
with fines of at least $350,000 and a maximum of three years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Departments crackdown on the international
conspiracy involving vitamins is part of a larger sweep that
involves collusion among a number of huge global companies.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, Hoechst AG, the German drug maker, pleaded guilty to
conspiring to fix prices in the food preservatives market. The
company agreed to pay a fine of $36 million. And in that same
month, the Justice Department settled the largest anti-trust action
in U.S. history when SGL Carbon of Germany agreed to pay $145
million to settle charges that it fixed prices in the sale of
graphite electrodes, which are used in the manufacturing of steel.

   JERUSALEM _ The politician considered the one truly principled
opponent of peace with the Palestinians suddenly stepped out of
public life Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Calling himself ``a cantor without a congregation,'' the
politician, Benny Begin, the ultranationalist son of the late
Menachem Begin, announced that he is quitting politics forever. His
no-concession National Union Party won just four seats in
parliament in Monday's election.
</P>
<P>
   Known as much for impolitic honesty as for his Bible-based
advocacy of Israeli sovereignty in the West Bank, Begin said he
would relinquish his own parliamentary seat and sever ties with the
party he founded. Few doubt his word.
</P>
<P>
   Though essentially symbolic, the public surrender of the chief
protest candidate of the far right would seem to bode well for the
newly elected prime minister, Ehud Barak, and his effort to
assemble a broad coalition committed to a negotiated peace with
both the Palestinians and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Barak still faces the basic paradox that has bedeviled prime
ministers here for a generation: To win support for peace accords
that permanently reshape Israel's borders, he must assemble as wide
a coalition as possible. But in stretching the boundaries of
government from the devoutly religious to the zealously secular, he
constrains his ability to make tough but essential policy choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is for a broad government, which means the politics of
inclusion,'' one of Barak's associates commented Wednesday night.
`` `Anyone is welcome, as long as they play by my rules.' But he is
not going to the lowest common denominator.''
</P>
<P>
   The suddenly altered demographics of Israeli politics make
coalition-building much easier.
</P>
<P>
   In final election results released Wednesday evening, parties at
least nominally supporting the basic outlines of the 1993 Oslo
land-for-security plan claimed all but 18 of the 120 seats in
parliament. The only declared opponents are Begin's party, two
Orthodox religious parties and a new Russian immigrant faction led
by Avigdor Lieberman, who once proclaimed that ``the only thing to
my right is a wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the anchors of the former coalition of Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu _ the ailing Likud, down to 19 seats from its
previous 34, and the giddily ascendant Shas, up to 17 from 10 _ are
officially committed to Israel's treaty promises.
</P>
<P>
   Shas, though dominated by ultra-Orthodox rabbis and often
associated with the hard right, has called for a swift withdrawal
from Lebanon and supported land-for-security tradeoffs in the West
Bank. Ultimately, as a party devoted to the craft of political
patronage, Shas is thoroughly domestic in its concerns, and largely
nonideological in its approach to security policy.
</P>
<P>
   But Shas' obsessive quest for control of local budgets and
constituent services, as well as the jailing of its leader for
corruption, could make Shas a problematic ally.
</P>
<P>
   The defeated Likud remains Barak's most important potential
partner on the right. Support from Likud for painful territorial
concessions _ the surrender of the Golan Heights to Syria, or the
turnover of small Jewish settlements to Palestinian control _ would
leave only a small religious-based minority as the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But with Netanyahu's abrupt resignation as party leader on
Monday night, it is uncertain where Likud now stands. Aspirants to
succeed him include Meir Sheetrit, the finance minister and
self-proclaimed peace advocate, and Ehud Olmert, Jerusalem's
ambitious mayor, who has infuriated Palestinians by accelerating
Jewish home building in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The ascendance on Tuesday of Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon as
Likud's caretaker leader does little to clarify Likud's direction.
The champion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and architect
of Israel's ``security zone'' across the border in Lebanon, Sharon
is nonetheless both pragmatic and covetous of continued authority.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has pledged to withdraw Israeli troops from Lebanon within
a year, and to proceed quickly with the stalled withdrawals from
the West Bank. Then he must proceed with the highly charged issues
of the Golan Heights and the political contours of a Palestinian
state. Aides acknowledge that it will be difficult for the new
government to follow both paths simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, a Lebanon withdrawal presents the fewest
difficulties. Israelis across the political spectrum are anxious to
end a two-decade military engagement that produces steady
casualties but few tangible security gains. In Barak's first early
morning speech after his election victory on Monday, it was his
promise to get out of Lebanon that elicited by far the most
enthusiastic response.
</P>
<P>
   If he so chose, Barak could quickly form a core 54-seat
coalition of five centrist and leftist secular Jewish parties: his
own One Israel movement, with 26 members of Parliament; Meretz,
with 10, and three parties with six seats each: Yitzhak Mordechai's
Center Party, Natan Sharansky's Yisrael B'Aliyah and the fiercely
anticlerical Shinui faction. The addition of a two-seat breakaway
Labor faction and three small Arab-dominated parties would give him
a solid 66-seat majority.
</P>
<P>
   But the desire to build a Jewish consensus in favor of any
permanent peace settlement could exclude the Arab bloc, analysts
say. Right-wing Israelis would find any peace plan endorsed by
Arabs inherently suspect, while Israeli Arab leaders would come
under intense constituent pressure to bolt a government that
refused to compromise on Palestinian claims on East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are big issues, and to deal with them as a society we
need a government of national unity, with both Likud and Labor,''
Sharansky said before the election. ``We need to build bridges.''

SENATORS CRITICIZE RENO FOR MISMANAGING CHINA ESPIONAGE CASE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senators at a closed-door hearing of the
Intelligence Committee Wednesday lashed out at Attorney General
Janet Reno for what they said was her failure to aggressively
manage the case of a suspected spy for China at the Los Alamos
nuclear weapons, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are responsible,'' one senator angrily told Reno in what
the officials described as a hearing punctuated with acidic
exchanges with the witnesses, who included FBI Director Louis Freeh
and Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder.
</P>
<P>
   Several senators repeated their conclusion that the Justice
Department and the FBI botched the security inquiry into Wen Ho
Lee, a nuclear scientist who worked for more than two decades at
Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was fired from his job for violations of security rules, but
he has not been charged with any crime. His lawyer has issued a
lengthy statement in which he steadfastly denied allegations that
Lee spied for China.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said they still have no hard evidence
that Lee passed any classified information to China.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, Sen. Richard C. Shelby, R-Ala., said the
committee was deeply disturbed by how the Justice Department and
the FBI handled the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the actions or inactions, on the part of the FBI and
the Justice Department, is dumbfounding to a lot of us, baffling,''
Shelby said. ``But we'll just continue our investigation. This is a
very important case.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno has said that the Justice Department will review whether
the department or FBI mishandled Lee's case. Law enforcement
officials said Wednesday that she is close to naming the staff for
the inquiry but has made little progress in re-examining the case.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, senators reviewed the Justice Department's
decisions in 1997 to twice reject a request by FBI
counterintelligence officials to seek a search warrant authorizing
more aggressive investigative techniques from a special court
established by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
</P>
<P>
   That law allows federal agents to clandestinely conduct searches
of homes, offices and computers, or install electronic listening
and video devices trained on espionage suspects under rules that
are less restrictive than search warrants obtained in criminal
cases through the federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico
have said the Justice Department's refusal to seek a FISA warrant
deterred them from invoking a policy that allowed them to
spot-check Lee's computer without any court authorization, fearing
it might taint any future case against him.
</P>
<P>
   But that chain of decision-making left federal authorities
ignorant for almost two years that Lee had routinely transferred
into an unclassified computer network millions of lines of secret
computer codes used in the development of advanced nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department rejected the FBI's request for a warrant
because it was dated, vague and lacked current evidence to provide
a basis for a reasonable suspicion that Lee was a spy, law
enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials later appealed the rejection to Reno in an
informal meeting in which a number of China-related issues were
discussed, but the subordinates who reconsidered the decision
affirmed the earlier rejection.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials subsequently tried to catch Lee in what
counterintelligence officials described as a ``false flag''
operation in which agents posing as foreigners tried to lure Lee
into spying. But Lee, officials said, did not take the bait.
</P>
<P>
   At the Justice Department, officials said the FBI managers did
not aggressively present the case for a warrant as a top
counterintelligence priority and were unwilling to deploy the large
number of agents that would have been required for full-time
surveillance that might have produced evidence to justify a FISA
warrant.
</P>
<P>
   But FBI officials said the Justice Department took the case
casually and failed to understand the difficulties in obtaining
concrete evidence in a case in which the suspected espionage may
have begun years earlier, before any investigation started.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, however, the failure to act could have a
significant impact. When agents finally opened Lee's office
computer earlier this year, they discovered that he had transferred
files from 1983 through 1995, and officials have said there is
evidence that someone else examined the files once they were in the
unclassified system.

MARKET PLACE: BROKERAGE LOBBY'S PROPOSAL ON MUTUAL FUNDS DRAWS
FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Securities Industry Association, Wall Street's lobbying arm
in Washington, is encountering stiff opposition to a recent
proposal that would make it easier for brokerage firms to do
business with their own mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, which would amend federal securities laws, was
tucked into a long deregulatory ``wish list'' that the association
submitted earlier this year to Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, chairman
of the Senate Banking Committee. If enacted, it would allow a
mutual fund to buy and sell securities with an affiliated brokerage
house without first seeking regulatory approval, as current law
requires.
</P>
<P>
   The concept has already drawn quiet but unequivocal objections
from the Investment Company Institute, the mutual fund industry's
trade association. In a letter sent to a top executive of the
Securities Industry Association in April, ICI president Matthew
Fink contended that the proposal would undermine a core protection
for mutual fund investors and was ``entirely objectionable'' to the
mutual fund industry.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the top fund industry regulator at the Securities and
Exchange Commission said he shared Fink's fears. Paul Roye, the
director of the SEC's division of investment management, which
oversees the fund industry, said in an interview that he was
concerned the lobbying group's proposal ``would take us back to the
1930s,'' when mutual funds sponsored by large brokerage houses
``were used as a dumping ground'' for excess inventory or unpopular
securities.
</P>
<P>
   Roye confirmed fund-industry reports that he would speak against
the proposal in his remarks Friday at the annual meeting of the
Investment Company Institute in Washington. ``I'm expressing my own
views, but my speech will reflect the advice I would give to the
commission,'' Roye said.
</P>
<P>
   SIA president Marc Lackritz said he hoped the furor over his
group's proposal would not obscure the potential benefits it could
bring to mutual fund investors. They could save hundreds of
millions of dollars, he said, if their fund managers were not
barred from doing business with affiliated broker-dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about ``affiliated transactions'' were a minefield in
the mutual fund industry since long before the passage of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, the bedrock law that governs the
nation's mutual fund industry.
</P>
<P>
   In congressional investigations that followed the 1929 market
crash, some prominent brokerage houses were criticized for using
their mutual funds as buyers of last resort for securities they
could not otherwise sell. In response, Congress prohibited any
affiliated transactions that the SEC had not approved in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Some fund industry lawyers and the Investment Company Institute
seem to ``view this prohibition as part of Holy Writ and have
reacted as if we are trying to amend the Ten Commandments,''
Lackritz said Wednesday. ``What we're really trying to do is find
new ways of helping investors,'' he said, by allowing fund managers
to take advantage of better prices, more useful products or
smoother trade executions that may be available through an
affiliate of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, the brokerage firms that support the proposal
are confident that internal fund rules and policies can be written
to prevent fund managers from becoming unwilling participants in
trades with affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbying group argues that the wholesale ban on self-dealing
no longer makes sense ``given the substantial changes in the
securities markets in the 60 years'' since it was first adopted.
</P>
<P>
   But, Roye of the SEC noted, it is just as difficult today as in
1940 for regulators or fund directors to be certain that a fund
manager dealing with an affiliated trading desk is doing what is in
the best interest of his investors and not simply giving in to
subtle pressure from the parent brokerage house.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it is true that the world has changed somewhat since
then, human nature hasn't changed,'' Roye said. And it was the
human temptations that arise when a fund deals with its parent or
affiliate that originally prompted Congress to bar such
transactions, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I would hope that, in looking at this, the folks on
the Hill would go back and look at why Congress had the wisdom to
put this prohibition in there in the first place.''

INTERNET POLITICAL DONATIONS MAY QUALIFY FOR MATCHING FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Responding to burgeoning political activity on the
Internet, the Federal Election Commission on Thursday is expected
to bring presidential fund raising into the age of electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC is very likely to change its rules to allow political
contributions by credit card to qualify for federal matching
campaign funds, two commission members said in interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the presidential contenders in 2000 have their own Web
sites, and many are using the Internet to solicit campaign
contributions paid by credit card. But so far, the FEC has allowed
matching money only for donations by check or other ``written
instruments'' because of concerns over fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Democratic candidate Bill Bradley asked the commission
to expand the matching funds, which come from checkoffs on
taxpayers' returns, to online credit card contributions.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the commission, Robert Bauer, the Bradley
campaign's general counsel, argued that online donations ``broaden
the base of financial support for presidential campaigns and
encourage renewed public confidence in American democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign started its Web site Dec. 4 and a campaign
spokesman said it had received $30,000 in online pledges and had
enlisted nearly 15,000 volunteers. The campaign has hired its own
Internet consultant, Lynn Reed.
</P>
<P>
   The first $250 of each individual contribution to presidential
candidates is matched with taxpayers' money as long as candidates
adhere to the federal spending limits. In 2000, candidates who
abide by the spending ceiling of about $40 million in the primary
will be eligible for up to $16.8 million in matching federal money.
</P>
<P>
   Some FEC officials have been concerned that credit card
donations do not have the same level of documentation or security
as checks, the two commissioners said, but these reservations gave
way to a desire to encourage Internet political activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally speaking, I don't think we ought to put barriers in
the way of the use of the Internet for political contributions
unless there's a compelling reason to do so,'' said David Mason, a
Republican who serves on the six-member commission, which is evenly
divided along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Sandstrom, a Democratic commissioner, said that ``advances
in technology'' had made online credit-card transactions secure
enough to satisfy the agency's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The expected approval of matching funds for online credit card
donations is being watched by the presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``2000 will be a groundbreaking year for Internet campaigning,''
said Juleanna Glover, press secretary for Republican candidate
Steve Forbes. ``The Internet will be to the 2000 election what
television was to the Nixon-Kennedy election.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Glover said the Forbes campaign, which has had more than
400,000 visitors to its Web site, had relied heavily on the
Internet to recruit volunteers and for small donations. Forbes does
not plan to apply for federal matching funds so he will not be
affected by the commission's decision.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC plans to review an array of Internet issues, the two
commissioners said, but decided to act first on the matching-funds
question because of the greater urgency. Other areas under review
are how and whether to value as political contributions the Web
sites operated by individuals that carry a candidate's messages and
Web links that connect voters from one Web site to a candidate's
site.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said it would be impractical for the commission to try to
broadly police the Internet. ``It's the frontier, the political
equivalent of the Wild West,'' he said. ``The commission ought to
stand back and learn a little more about what this medium looks
like before it begins to introduce new restrictions and create
broad policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Most campaigns update their Web sites daily and include video
snippets and text of the candidates' speeches and other political
news. Elizabeth Dole's site also offers revolving snapshots,
including one from her wedding day, as well as a memorial to
Leader, the Dole dog who died Feb. 28. The Dole campaign says it
has enlisted over 5,000 volunteers on its Web site and taken in
over $50,000 in pledges.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia Lundberg of Portland, Ore., gave $1,000, the maximum
allowed, to the campaign through the Dole Web site. ``The campaign
site provides a great way to get information without waiting to
watch the news,'' Ms. Lundberg said, ``and on my own time.''
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates are also raising money on the Web, although it
is still a small fraction of their fund raising over all. The Gore
campaign, which has raised more than $9 million, has drawn $17,000
in online pledges.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the presidential nominees both had Internet sites but
they were mainly bulletin boards containing basic biographical and
campaign information.

NURSING HOME LOBBYIST FIGHTS MEDICARE CUTS HE PUSHED AS GOP CHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Iowa, Calif., N.M., Ky., Ga., Ark., Ohio, Pa.)   (bl)  
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Republican national chairman, Haley Barbour
designed his party's campaign to cut the growth of Medicare. Now he
has taken on a new assignment. As a lobbyist for a dozen large
nursing home companies, he pleads with Congress for relief from the
law he helped write.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995-96, Barbour told anyone who would listen that Medicare's
explosive growth threatened to bankrupt the program. He worked hand
in glove with House Speaker Newt Gingrich on legislation to rein in
Medicare spending. Now he complains that Medicare is spending too
little.
</P>
<P>
   ``Underspending by Medicare for skilled nursing homes is having
serious effects in the real world,'' Barbour said in an interview
Wednesday. ``Close to 20,000 caregivers have been laid off. There's
concern that nursing homes will close. It's resulting in harm to
senior citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   People outside Washington might see some inconsistency between
Barbour's earlier support for Medicare cutbacks and his work as a
lobbyist now. But his advocacy raises few eyebrows in the capital,
where dozens of people pass through the revolving door between
government and industry every year, where politicians do battle by
day but share cozy dinners in the evening, where legislators can
switch their votes overnight because of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other recent chairman of the Republican National
Committee, however, Barbour shaped the party's agenda, and
influenced legislation, through frequent meetings with Republican
leaders on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Barbour, whose four-year term as chairman ended in January 1997,
said Wednesday that he was retained by his nursing home clients in
April and had since discussed their problems with about 15 members
of Congress, mostly Republican senators.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Clinton administration could take steps of its own
to relieve the burden on nursing homes, without waiting for
Congress to act. But he has not talked to administration officials.
As a rock-ribbed Republican, he said, ``I'm probably not the best
person for that assignment.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., who served in the House for 20
years, said he was lobbying the administration on behalf of the
same group of nursing homes as Barbour.
</P>
<P>
   Barbour has not yet filed the required forms with Congress to
disclose the amount spent lobbying for nursing homes on Capitol
Hill. Asked how much he was being paid, he said, ``Not enough,''
and laughed.
</P>
<P>
   He confirmed that his clients included the Sun Healthcare Group
of Albuquerque, N.M.; Vencor Inc. of Louisville, Ky.; the Mariner
Post-Acute Network Inc. of Atlanta; Beverly Enterprises of Fort
Smith, Ark.; HCR Manor Care Inc. of Toledo, Ohio; Genesis Health
Ventures of Kennett Square, Pa., and Extendicare Inc. of Markham,
Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Barbour said he saw no contradiction between his old and new
roles. The Medicare cuts, he said, have been much deeper than
either he or Congress expected under the entirely new method of
reimbursement established by the 1997 law. In the first half of the
current fiscal year, he noted, Medicare actually spent less than in
the first half of the prior year. In the last week, three of
Barbour's clients have reported quarterly losses, due in large
part, they say, to the Medicare cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's ironic,'' Barbour said, ``is that this administration
is spending so much less on Medicare than Congress intended when it
passed the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. It's the same
administration that in 1995 and 1996 constantly clobbered
Republicans'' for proposing Medicare cuts that have proved to be
less severe than those that have actually occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The nursing home industry has long been a potent force in
Washington and many state capitals. Alan Solomont, former finance
chairman of the Democratic National Committee, was chief executive
of the largest nursing home company in Massachusetts and just last
month was host at a Democratic fund-raiser attended by President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's political action committee, the American Health
Care Association PAC, made campaign contributions of more than
$900,000 in 1997-98, according to data filed with the Federal
Election Commission and tabulated by Public Disclosure Inc., a
nonpartisan research group.
</P>
<P>
   Barbour, a seventh-generation Mississippian, has been in and
around Washington since 1985, when he became director of the White
House office of political affairs under President Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   He blends his political insights with an exceptionally detailed
knowledge of health care policy. Like a true policy expert, he
refers to sicker people as ``high acuity patients,'' meaning that
they have acute illnesses. And he speaks knowledgeably of RUGs, the
``resource utilization groups'' into which patients are classified
according to their medical condition and need for care.
</P>
<P>
   Barbour suggests two specific ways to relieve the financial
distress of nursing homes: Medicare, he says, should provide a more
generous allowance for inflation, based on the market basket of
goods and services used by nursing homes. In addition, he says, it
should increase its payments for sicker patients.
</P>
<P>
   Barbour estimated that his clients were receiving an average of
$270 to $285 a day for each Medicare patient. By contrast, he said,
when the budget law was signed in 1997, nursing homes had been
getting $360 a day or more for each Medicare patient, and expected
to get $310 to $320 a day in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Special
Committee on Aging, met recently with Barbour and has requested
more financial data. Before rushing to bail out any companies with
taxpayers' money, Grassley said, he wants to know whether they have
been mismanaged, whether they grew ``too large too fast'' and
whether they took on more debt than they could handle.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, he said, they must not solve their problems by
evicting patients or reducing the quality of care.

HUNDREDS OF YUGOSLAV TROOPS DESERT, SAYS NATO 
</HEADLINE>

   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Hundreds of Yugoslav soldiers deserted their
brigade in Kosovo on Tuesday, defying their officers and fighting
through a military checkpoint to return to their homes in Krusevac,
to the north, NATO officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers, mostly reservists from the 7th Infantry Brigade in
Istok, hurried back to Krusevac after hearing from radio broadcasts
that police there were suppressing anti-war protests by women and
children in the village, the allied officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said
``battalion-level units'' were leaving their posts in Kosovo. He
cited intelligence reports, but provided no specific evidence of
widespread desertions. He also dismissed speculation that what
NATO's analysts saw as desertions may be withdrawals of the
Yugoslav military or police units.
</P>
<P>
   The allies' account of desertion was one of a series of
anecdotes that NATO has circulated to suggest that the air campaign
has had a devastating effect on the morale of President Slobodan
Milosevic's forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley Clark, the allied military commander, has said of
Milosevic: ``We're winning. He's losing. He knows it.''
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, NATO has not met its principal goal: to force
Milosevic to withdraw his troops from Kosovo. The same troops that
expelled more than 800,000 ethnic Albanians from Kosovo are now
digging in to block a possible allied invasion force, according to
military analysts here.
</P>
<P>
   And the conscripts who bolted from Istok represent only a
fraction of the 40,000-member force in Kosovo, and are not
front-line troops. Allied intelligence officials offered no other
specific examples of mass desertions, despite NATO leaflets,
intended for dropping over Yugoslavia, that assert 13,000 have
deserted.

 Column: Gaming Magazines Dig In for Showdown in S.F.
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Dan Fost &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
As if computer games aren't bloody enough, the magazines that cover
the industry are engaged in a violent war for readers and
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   A German games-magazine publisher has established a beachhead in
San Francisco and plans to move into the same building occupied by
rival Ziff-Davis. The Germans' first U.S. venture is led by an
editor swiped from another big player, Brisbane's Imagine Media.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the scene is International Data Group, which has
its gaming powerhouse _ GamePro magazine _ headquartered on San
Francisco's Second Street.
</P>
<P>
   At stake are magazines serving a computer and video game market
that's growing rapidly and ready to surpass the movie industry for
entertainment dollars. Sales of game software and hardware reached
$6.3 billion last year, compared to movies' $6.8 billion domestic
gross.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the German firm Computec Media said it would move
from Redwood City to San Francisco _ to the same building, the
former Fashion Center at Eighth and Townsend streets, that now
houses game firm Sega of America as well as 343 of Ziff-Davis' 834
Bay Area employees.
</P>
<P>
   Computec already has launched one magazine, MCV: The Market for
Home Computing and Videogames, and is vague on further plans. It
has 45 employees here and expects to be up to 80 by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Computec has their work cut out for them,'' said Jonathan
Simpson-Bint, president of Imagine's entertainment division.
``They're going up against two very well-entrenched competitors in
Imagine and Ziff-Davis. We've fought very very hard for the market
share we've got, and we're not going to give it up lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   People at Ziff also are watching Computec's moves. ``I don't
know why anyone would start from scratch in print,'' said Vince
Broady, co-founder and editorial director of Gamespot. ``It's
fiercely competitive, and it's really come under fire from online
for serving the needs of the user.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gaming is a daily passion,'' Broady said. ``How can you serve
that using a monthly medium?''
</P>
<P>
   His colleague Dale Strang, the vice president of Ziff's game
group, might disagree; after all, Strang's division sells nearly
900,000 of those magazines a month. The PlayStation magazine sells
for a hefty $8 on newsstands and does well, thanks to a popular
compact disc of game demos that's packaged with the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Ziff also has added the innovation of putting ads on the disc.
Gamers' reactions have yet to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, with 90 percent of its 200 employees in the Bay Area,
battles Ziff head-to-head with several magazines.
</P>
<P>
   In the realm of games for personal computers, Imagine's PC Gamer
US claims a circulation of 350,000 a month, compared to almost
300,000 for Ziff's Computer Gaming World. Three months ago, Imagine
bought IDG's PC Games and folded it into PC Gamer; Imagine also
publishes PC Accelerator, with a circulation of 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the market aimed at Sony PlayStation devotees, Ziff publishes
Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine, with a circulation of 180,000.
Imagine's ``unofficial'' competitive offering, PSM, sells 250,000
copies a month, and the company says it's the fastest-growing
magazine of any kind in the country. Ziff says it's growing, too,
and will average 275,000 in the coming year. A smaller company,
Dimension Publishing of Folsom (Sacramento County), publishes PS
Extreme.
</P>
<P>
   An even more lucrative market is for console games of all
platforms. This area is the most competitive: IDG's GamePro boasts
a circulation of more than 500,000; Ziff's Electronic Gaming
Monthly has 400,000, while its Expert Gamer sells 190,000 copies;
and Imagine's Next Generation sells 135,000 copies a month. Lagging
the field is Tips and Tricks, published by porn magnate Larry
Flynt. (The man clearly understands his audience.)
</P>
<P>
   Imagine said last week that it had snared rights to publish the
Official Sega Dreamcast Magazine. Dreamcast is Sega's
next-generation gaming console, due out this fall, that will try to
chip away the Sony PlayStation's lead.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Imagine said it was merging with Future
Publishing, a British firm which was founded in 1985 by Imagine
chief executive Chris Anderson and then sold off in 1994. Imagine
says that as a result of the merger, it likely will launch more
gamer magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine and Ziff don't compete in the world of online gaming
news ever since Imagine spun off its Imagine Games Network as part
of a separate entity called Affiliation Networks about four months
ago. That site, at  &LR; www.ign.com,  &LR; competes with Ziff's Gamespot,
Cnet's Gamecenter, Theglobe.com's Happy Puppy, and Unified Gamers
Online. And last week, IDG Games Media Group _ publisher of GamePro
magazine _ launched an online venture tied to that popular mag,
GameProWorld.com. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It's this hotbed of gaming news that Computec is entering, amid
widespread rumors _ first of their ambitious plans, then of their
scaling back. It's all false, said Christian Svensson, CEO and
editor in chief of Computec's MCV USA magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're being quite secretive,'' Svensson said.
</P>
<P>
   But he plans to be successful and to aim at the mass market
instead of just teenage boys. ``We will launch with a $15 million
marketing campaign,'' he said. ``That will make it the largest
magazine launch in the last five years. A mass market magazine
needs that kind of support.''
</P>
<P>
   Computec, a 10-year-old company based in Nuremberg, went public
on Germany's Nuer exchange in December and now boasts a $300
million market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize the competitive landscape in North America is
very tough. We have a competitive staff that will weasel in the
back door when nobody is looking,'' Svensson said.
</P>
<P>
   That may not work, Christian. Your neighbors at Ziff and Imagine
are watching.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TOPPING THE LIST &LR; : Walter Mossberg remains king of the hill.
But Business Week's Steve Wildstrom is coming up fast.
</P>
<P>
   Mossberg, the Wall Street Journal's personal technology
columnist, once again leads an annual list of the most influential
tech journalists, slated to hit the streets Monday in the latest
issue of Marketing Computers magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeff O'Brien, the editor of the San Francisco trade
magazine, says Wildstrom is Mossberg's ``heir to the throne.''
</P>
<P>
   Wildstrom was in 19th place last year, but O'Brien says ``what
makes him so influential is that just like Mossberg, on any given
week, he can make or break a product. ... He can kill a whole
category.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a techie, a geek at heart, but he can write both
technology for the common man and espouse on the future of the
industry,'' O'Brien says.
</P>
<P>
   After Mossberg _ No.1 in each of the six years of the list _ and
Wildstrom, the top five are Bob Evans, editor in chief of CMP's
Information Week; John Markoff, a veteran Silicon Valley reporter
at the New York Times; and Michael Miller, editor in chief of
Ziff-Davis' PC Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien dropped Miller down from No.2 last year. ``Ziff-Davis
and all the trades have had tough years,'' he said. ``Miller and
his team have to figure out what's next for PC Magazine. To some
degree, they've been hurt by the Web. How important is it to pick
up PC Magazine if all you're looking for is product reviews and you
can go to the Web to get them?''
</P>
<P>
   The entire list will be posted online next week at
 &LR; www.marketingcomputers.com &LR; . The magazine is available through a
free subscription &UR;  &LR; to public relations professionals but is not on
newsstands.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien also let his readers vote this year on the Raspberries,
zapping the most difficult publications to work with. The top spot
was a tie between Upside magazine and the Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   I'm still trying to figure out if that's a good thing or a bad
thing.

 Raychem Selling for $2.87 Billion
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Henry Norr &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Raychem Corp., a Menlo Park electronics manufacturer that employs
some 3,000 people in the Bay Area, will be acquired by Tyco
International Ltd. for $2.87 billion in cash and stock, the two
companies said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Tyco, an industrial conglomerate that expects to have $22
billion in sales this year, is buying Raychem to strengthen its
position as a leading electronics supplier to the
telecommunications and automotive industries.
</P>
<P>
   Tyco has spent more than $25 billion in acquisitions in the past
two years. Just six weeks ago, it closed a $12.2 billion purchase
of AMP Inc., the world's leading manufacturer of electronic
connectors.
</P>
<P>
   Raychem will be incorporated into Tyco's Electrical and
Electronic Components division, the same organization AMP is now
part of. Raychem's products, such as its heat-shrinkable tubing,
are often used with AMP's connectors, according to Raychem
spokesman Scott Wylie.
</P>
<P>
   ``You end up with a broader, integrated product line, and we
know our customers like to deal with broad-gauge suppliers,'' Wylie
said.
</P>
<P>
   Raychem will continue to operate under its own name. The
company's chief executive, Richard Kashnow, will become a member of
Tyco's executive team and will remain responsible for Raychem's
operations, according to Wylie.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be some reduction in head-count as the companies
come together, but we just don't know the extent and nature of the
reductions yet,'' Wylie said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its executive team, the company's local staff
includes employees in manufacturing, research and development, and
sales and marketing. Worldwide, the company employs some 9,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   Raychem, founded in 1957, makes a variety of components sold to
other manufacturers. Products include fuses, wiring harnesses,
tubing and touch-screen terminals.
</P>
<P>
   In its last fiscal year, it recorded sales of nearly $1.8
billion, but net income dropped 46 percent to $131.5 million, a
decline company officials attributed primarily to economic
difficulties in Asia, Brazil, Russia and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Tyco, which is headquartered in Hamilton, Bermuda, will pay an
estimated $2.87 billion for Raychem, based on Tuesday's May &LR; 
18 &LR; closing value of Tyco shares. The payment will consist of $1.4
billion in cash plus 16.1 million newly issued Tyco shares.
</P>
<P>
   The price amounts to $37 per share for Raychem, a 19 percent
premium relative to its closing price on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Raychem shareholders will be able to decide how much of their
payment will be in cash and how much in Tyco shares, within the
limits of the amounts Tyco has set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Tyco shares closed yesterday at $93.50, up $4.13. Raychem
climbed $5.13 to $36.25.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition is expected to close in about four months, Wylie
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tyco is best known for its fire-protection systems and
electronic security systems, but its recent acquisitions have moved
it into such markets as medical products, plastics and adhesives,
as well as telecommunications. Tyco is No.1 in underwater
telecommunications systems. In a separate transaction yesterday,
Tyco also bought the undersea cable business of Telefonica SA,
Spain's largest phone company, for $280 million in cash.

SKEPTICAL TERRY BROOKS ENDED UP PLEASED WITH `STAR WARS'
NOVELIZATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ No, he didn't do it for the money.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Brooks makes much more money on his own books, including
his trademark ``Shannara'' series, than he was to be paid for the
novel based upon ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   And, no, he didn't do it for the sales.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks has had plenty of best sellers in the past, 14 in all
leading to overall sales of 12 million books, making him one of the
sure-bet successes among popular authors today.
</P>
<P>
   What ultimately convinced the 55-year-old West Seattle writer to
turn someone else's movie script into a novel, even though that
someone else was George Lucas, was the thought of who would be
offended and what might happen if he turned it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `Star Wars' project was first proposed to me when I was on
the phone in a shopping mall with a bunch of children passing by,''
Brooks recalled this week, ``and I immediately thought that if I
turn this down, I'll never be able to explain it to my own kids.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brooks still was intensely leery about the project. He had
done a novelization of Stephen Spielberg's Peter Pan adaptation,
``Hook.'' It had been such a nightmare that Brooks, a proud
craftsman at the writer's trade, repeatedly had told anyone who
would listen that he would not do such a thing ever again. There
simply was not enough money anywhere to compensate for that amount
of frustration.
</P>
<P>
   He had never met with Spielberg or even talked to him, for one
thing, and there were so many script changes throughout the project
that Brooks, a meticulous outliner of his work, felt as though he
were trying to build a novel on a foundation of quicksand.
</P>
<P>
   So Brooks arrived in Northern California at Lucas' Skywalker
Ranch in a state of profound skepticism, even if he felt some
kinship with Lucas since both ``Star Wars'' and ``The Sword of
Shannara'' had been released in 1977 and the two shared the same
book editor. Brooks kept reminding himself that he was fully
prepared to walk away from the new project at the slightest hint
that it might be ``Hook Revisited.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lucas' staffers charmed him with their relaxed approach,
their openness and the way they immediately treated him as a
colleague. A four-hour meeting with Lucas himself only cemented
Brooks' decision.
</P>
<P>
   Right off, the writer told the originator of ``Star Wars'' that
he might not be the right person for his book project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that I thought I was an odd choice,'' Brooks
remembered from that initial conversation. ``I said, `I'm not a
science fiction writer, so if that's what you're looking for,
you've got the wrong guy. I do not write science fiction, I write
adventure stories. If you want a good adventure story writer, then
you've got the right guy.' '
</P>
<P>
   Lucas' agreement with that helped ease Brooks' fears, as did
Lucas' assertion that he wanted a novel that expanded on the film
instead of merely fitting into a ``Phantom Menace'' straitjacket.
And Brooks was even more impressed after he challenged Lucas'
proposal that much of the story be told in flashbacks, saying that
would not be his approach, that it would be ``poor writing.'' Lucas
deferred to his judgment after some spirited give-and-take.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks did most of the writing in the third-floor office of his
spacious West Seattle home, an office with brimming bookshelves
(including such literary authors as Cormac McCarthy and Alice
Hoffman), several pieces of glass art, its own fireplace, several
pieces of Darth Vader memorabilia given him by his daughter, and a
dazzling panoramic view of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Writing has indeed been very good to the attorney-turned-writer,
who has another another home on the Big Island of Hawaii where he
and his wife, Judine, spend about three months a year.
</P>
<P>
   The film script was his Bible as Brooks began the outline of the
novel's chapters, a technique he considers absolutely crucial to
creating an appealing story with well-developed drama and
character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outlining,'' Brooks emphasized, ``is the most important stuff,
the hard stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas' editors were just a telephone call away, eager to provide
whatever Brooks needed to craft his version of the story. There was
also a CD-ROM with 6,000 images from the film that could be checked
whenever Brooks was describing a character or a scene and wanted to
ensure its accuracy, plus ``reams of paper'' setting forth names,
people, plants, planets, ships _ all the insider stuff that legions
of ``Star Wars'' fanatics would one day be committing to memory.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks started his story at a time earlier than in the film, in
order to give greater insight into the character of Anakin
Skywalker, the 9-year-old slave boy and expert pod racer destined
to become archvillain Darth Vader. The book, as Brooks envisioned
it, would unfold at a slower pace than the film, with more time
devoted to developing background and motivation. There was also the
chance to hint at some of the action to take place in the next two
``Star Wars'' films, within Lucas' limits.
</P>
<P>
   The real challenge for the writer, who was working under a
120-day deadline, came from within.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of book is so much easier than doing your own work
that you can find yourself thinking of it as a lesser thing,''
Brooks admitted. ``So there is also a tendency to want to slip over
things and get through it. I had to keep reminding myself to expand
</P>
<P>
   what's there in the script, to provide more depth and to not be
careless.''
</P>
<P>
   What Brooks ended up writing is a straight-ahead adventure story
cast toward the widest possible audience. His ``Phantom Menace''
(Del Rey/Lucas Books, 324 pages, $25) is a solid piece of
commercial fiction that moves smartly from scene to scene, with
crisp exchanges of dialogue and a minimum of descriptive
flourishes. It is a book that seems to follow the naval maxim,
``Steady as she goes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never felt I had anything to prove with this book,'' Brooks
related. ``I just wanted to do the best I could do, which is
exactly what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Where his ``Phantom Menace'' has gone in the two weeks since
publication is straight to the top of every fiction best-seller
list, much to the delight of Brooks, who has had more than a
half-dozen books claim the second spot, but never had one take the
top.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks' novel has been helped by the clever marketing ploy of
having four separate covers with four different characters from the
film (all the better to ensure quadruple sales to collectors), plus
the unprecedented hype building up to Wednesday's release of the
film. Brooks, who has seen the original ``Star Wars'' a dozen
times, attributes the publicity juggernaut to the years that have
passed since the last ``Star Wars'' film, which has led many to
want ``to recapture the feeling they had back then.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, an amiable fellow with a distinct sense of humor, has no
delusions about the novel's popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a reflection that I'm a great writer,'' he said.
``It's a reflection of the `Star Wars' craze.''
</P>
<P>
   The writer has seen that craze up close and it has left him more
than a little bemused. His appearance at a ``Star Wars'' festival
in Denver, along with some of the lesser characters from the film,
drew 40,000 people who waited in lines for five hours for the
chance to buy merchandise or secure autographs.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks signed autographs for seven hours one day, with only a
45-minute break to give a presentation. He has long had his own
legions of fans who crowd his readings and signings, but Denver was
an out-of-this-world experience for the writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This instead was more like being a rock star,'' Brooks
stressed. ``It made you wonder how anybody with that level of
public attention can keep their sanity. Actually, I came away
understanding why those people often seem to go nuts. And if I had
been a new writer, instead of someone well-established, I'm sure I
would have gone nuts, too.''

NHL HAS ITS OWN STAR POWER

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Pssst! You on the couch over there. You have the
glazed look of someone who has seen way too many Philly Men of
Hoops replays or Phantom Menace trailers. Put that remote control
down and listen up.
</P>
<P>
   May we be candid? You need to be raised right out of your rut
and maybe even your seat. We've got just the thing. It's a viewing
alternative to both Star Wars, the one conceptualized by George
Lucas as well as the one supervised by David Stern.
</P>
<P>
   What is it? Why, only one of the best-kept trade secrets around.
The Phantom Menace script has nothing on the NHL postseason.
</P>
<P>
   The National Hockey League. Doesn't ring a bell, eh?
</P>
<P>
   A pity, that.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Cup hockey has been playing for a while in front of cult
audiences in the sporting equivalent of art houses. All but four
teams have been killed off, but if you tune in now you can get up
to speed on all the remaining characters and story lines before the
grand climax.
</P>
<P>
   As far as plots go, the NHL playoffs have shared quite a few
similarities with the NBA's mega-production that has, as usual,
monopolized the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   You have a retiring superstar to replace and, for the first time
in three years, the promise of a new champion. You have a
controlling coach named Pat, a team that has excelled with a
gallery of interchangeable shooters, a dignified veteran in search
of his first championship ring, an experienced squad that strangles
the life out of its opponents and a team that just may have the
Force with it.
</P>
<P>
   The Pat Riley of hockey is the Toronto Maple Leafs' Pat Quinn, a
one-time coach of the Los Angeles Kings who is in his first season
with his fourth franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs are the feel-good story of the playoffs, or
would be if the principal characters were more accessible. Hockey
players generally are as congenial as professional athletes come.
Indeed, to depict them any other way borders on blasphemy.
</P>
<P>
   Or did, anyway, before the cantankerous Quinn instituted
security measures that surely were inspired by a visit to
Buckingham Palace. Reporters wishing to talk to a player no longer
can count on catching them at their dressing room stalls. Their
best bet is to go through a team official, who will try to track
the player down.
</P>
<P>
   That's no sure thing, given that the Maple Leafs' new arena, the
Air Canada Centre, has more dressing room exits than there are
choices in the electronic scoreboard shell game.
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs, with their swarming offense, are as exciting to
watch as the Lakers. Too bad they are infinitely less quotable.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto will play the Buffalo Sabres in the Eastern Conference
finals. The Sabres are the Portland Trail Blazers of the NHL. They
spread the puck around the way the Trail Blazers do the basketball.
Buffalo's leading scorer, Michael Peca, has 11 points in 10 games.
Who needs a sniper when you have the league's best player, Dominik
Hasek, in goal?
</P>
<P>
   Hasek plays as if he has no spine. The way he flops around,
you'd think he was another of Lucas' computer-generated creations,
a hybrid of Jar Jar Binks or something.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Boston veteran Ray Bourque plays his position by
the book. In his 20 years in the league he has penned the chapter
on offensive defensemen. Bourque, like the New York Knicks' Patrick
Ewing, is a proud warrior who has yet to bag the ultimate team
prize.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing's title hopes remain alive but Bourque's dream was snuffed
out by Hasek and Co. in the Eastern Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The only No. 1 seed to advance to the Final Four is also the
NHL's biggest bore. The Dallas Stars play defense like the Utah
Jazz. They don't beat their opponents, they win by attrition.
</P>
<P>
   How tedious are we talking? Dallas defenseman Derian Hatcher
cheerily admits, ``We take 60-goal scorers and make them 30-goal
scorers.''
</P>
<P>
   If J.R. Reid vs. Tim Duncan is your idea of a matchup made in
heaven, you'll dig Dallas vs. the Colorado Avalanche in the Western
Conference final.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche's opening-round series against San Jose was
delayed a few days to afford the city of Denver time to mourn the
dead in the Columbine High shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado dedicated its postseason to the victims and their
families, then went out and let San Jose tie the best-of-seven
series at 2 with an ugly 7-3 loss just a few miles up the road from
Littleton, the site of the school tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, goaltender Patrick Roy, who is playing like it's 1993
(if you're unsure what that means, ask a Kings fan), shocked his
teammates with a tongue lashing that got their collective heart
beating again.
</P>
<P>
   In the eight games since then, the Avalanche has outscored San
Jose and two-time defending Stanley Cup champion Detroit 35-13.
That's a take off from the tenor of a postseason that has seen the
outcome of 32 of 68 games pivot on one goal.
</P>
<P>
   The television ratings for the NHL playoffs are better than last
year but still far, far away from great. Perhaps all those Star
Wars fans who've been waiting in line the past few weeks to see the
Phantom Menace will morph overnight into raw Stars aficionados.
</P>
<P>
   Don't laugh. What gives rise to a galaxy far, far away if not
the imagination?

HARVARD OFFICIALS LINK EX-DIVINITY SCHOOL DEAN TO PORNOGRAPHY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn., Mass.)   (rk) 
 By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ In a case that has raised questions of
privacy and propriety on the Harvard University campus, university
officials said Wednesday that the dean of the Divinity School was
forced to resign last fall because pornographic images had been
discovered on his university-owned computer.
</P>
<P>
   The dean, Ronald F. Thiemann, a nationally prominent theologian
who had established a Center for the Study of Values in Public Life
at the school, was asked to resign by President Neil L. Rudenstine
after several people saw the pornographic images on his computer,
said the officials, who spoke on the condition that they not be
named.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard announced his sudden departure at the time, but there
had been no explanation until The Boston Globe reported the
existence of the pornographic material Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard officials familiar with the case said Thiemann made
little effort to hide the material, sometimes leaving it on his
computer screen in his official residence. At one point, Thiemann
even asked the computer department for more disk space for his
computer and requested a university technician to transfer the
pornographic files to the new drive, the officials related.
</P>
<P>
   The Divinity School's rules prohibit the personal use of
university computers outside the school's educational mission and
specifically ban the ``introduction'' of material that is
``inappropriate, obscene, bigoted or abusive.'' Thiemann is
currently on leave and Harvard has taken no action to revoke his
tenured professorship.
</P>
<P>
   Thiemann's lawyer, Charles Ogletree, a professor at the Harvard
Law School, said he would have no comment on accusations made by
university officials unless they were quoted by name, and he said
that some of the accusations were incorrect. Ogletree declined to
elaborate on which charges were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Ogletree also said there were ``constitutional issues raised''
when an employer intruded on the private life of an employee.
</P>
<P>
   After he resigned on Nov. 13, several divinity school professors
said, Thiemann told them he had medical problems, including
depression. Harvard officials said Wednesday that when the
pornography was discovered, they were concerned that the episode
might be linked to emotional problems.
</P>
<P>
   During Thiemann's 13 years as dean, the Divinity School rose
from the second-class status it long held next to Harvard's more
prestigious medical, law and business schools. In his 13 years as
dean, the school's endowment almost quadrupled to $245 million from
$64 million.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations against Thiemann left the school in turmoil
Wednesday. The acting dean, J. Bryan Hehar, called three separate
meetings with the faculty, administrators and students.
</P>
<P>
   Professors at the Divinity School declined to return phone calls
Wednesday or said they were told to refer media calls to Harvard's
spokesman, Joe Wrinn, the director of the Harvard News Office.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Richard J. Wood, the dean of the Yale University Divinity
School, said the case was complex, because many people keep
personal items on their business computers. He also said the
pornography did not involve children and was not illegal.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas W. Ogletree, a professor of Christian ethics at the
Yale Divinity School and a former dean there, said pornography
presented an ambiguous problem. ``You have both the emphasis on the
freedom of private expression and the concern, especially by
feminists, that pornography exploits women or children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Smedes, a professor emeritus of Christian ethics at Fuller
Theological Seminary in Pasadena, Calif., was more critical. ``We
in the clergy agree that pornography in society is on balance evil,
a great evil,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thiemann is an ordained Lutheran minister.
</P>
<P>
   Students at Harvard Divinity School seemed to be more lenient on
Thiemann.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Smith, 24 , a second-year student studying ethics and
philosophy, said: ``Even if he is a Divinity School dean or
professor, I think that Harvard's action is a little extreme. The
kind of moral policing that we're having in our society is really
getting out of hand.''

UNCERTAIN OF ITS PATH, UNITED STATES PROVIDES NO DIRECTION TO
ALLIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: LEADS with 5 grafs to emphasize Clinton's uncertainty,
clarify 3rd graf, fix second reference for Milosevic in 5th graf;
Pickup 6th graf, Certainly, events ...) (rm) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ As President Clinton wrestles over the
question of dispatching combat troops to Kosovo, NATO's strategy
for bringing the war to a successful close is starting to unravel.
</P>
<P>
   And without Washington providing a clear direction, Britain,
Germany and Italy have begun to publicly promote separate and
conflicting plans.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been unable to quiet the unruly chorus
because it has not made up its own mind about how to force
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia to accept the allies'
terms. As Washington's allies lock horns over the risks and
advantages of a land campaign, President Clinton has said only that
he is not excluding the option.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have is a committee that lacks a chairman,'' said Ivo
Daalder, the former director of European Affairs at the National
Security Council. ``There is a lack of direction because no one is
leading the way.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's confusion is, no doubt, welcome news for Milosevic. From
the start, his strategy has been to ride out the air war, encourage
divisions within the Western alliance and try to negotiate a Kosovo
settlement on his terms.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, events at NATO headquarters this week provided ample
evidence of dissension within the ranks. British Foreign Minister
Robin Cook started off the week by reminding the alliance that time
was running out for NATO's plan to return ethnic Albanian refugees
to Kosovo before the winter. He urged NATO to quicken the pace by
considering a land attack after Serb troops were weakened by
several more months of air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The British plan, however, was greeted today with undisguised
contempt by German Chancellor Gerhard Schroder.
</P>
<P>
   Under political pressure from pacifists in his coalition
government, Schroder told a closed-door meeting of NATO ambassadors
that Germany wanted the air war to continue but would not back a
NATO ground attack. That was a significant statement since there
cannot be an allied land campaign without the approval of all 19
NATO members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not participate in this specifically British debate on
war theories,'' Schroder later said in caustic remarks to the
press. ``I am against any change in NATO strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was just the German view. The Italians have their own
political problems: leftists in Italy's government's coalition have
complained about allied air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with the criticism at home, Italy has fashioned its own,
somewhat convoluted plan. It has urged NATO to impose a 48-hour
bombing pause after the United Nations Security Council agrees to a
resolution outlining the principles of a peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   If Belgrade still balked, Italy says, NATO could restart its air
strikes and mount a land campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each country has to deal with its own domestic
constituencies,'' a senior Western diplomat said. ``Like everything
in NATO, this will depend on where the United States comes down.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressing question is whether air strikes alone will enable
NATO to attain its objectives. And if it does not, should the
alliance compromise with President Milosevic or raise the stakes by
sending in ground troops?
</P>
<P>
   Washington has yet to declare its hand, virtually inviting a
continuation of the noisy debate. Top Clinton administration
officials have said there is no allied agreement for a land
campaign without noting that Washington has done nothing to create
a consensus.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's indecisiveness recalls the
embarrassing round of diplomacy it conducted when it first began to
grapple with the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, when the war in Bosnia raged, the White House developed
a plan to use air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs and to arm the
Bosnian Muslims. Instead of telling the Europeans that this is how
the allies needed to proceed, however, the Clinton administration
dispatched Secretary of State Warren Christopher to solicit the
allies view on the option.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans were surprised that the world's superpower was in
a listening mode and did not hesitate to rebuff the idea. It took
two more years, and countless lives, before the Clinton
administration insisted that the allies go along with its plan.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Washington is putting off the difficult decision on ground
troops for as long as possible in the hope that the Milosevic
regime, not NATO, will crack.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning preparations for a land war, Western officials
acknowledge, would be a wrenching decision for NATO under any
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   But one diplomat added: ``It's hard to envisage the alliance
coming to terms with the issue until the leader of NATO is prepared
to make a decision,''

BUSH WINNING POINTS WITH GREEN MOVEMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A shift in Gov. George W. Bush's environmental
platform is winning cautious praise from environmentalists, but
pro-business groups are expressing puzzlement and alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the top GOP White House contender, recently changed to a
greener position on global warming and has moved closer to
environmentalists on the issue of getting certain industrial plants
to reduce pollution levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very positive,'' said Neil Carman, clean air
director for the Texas branch of the Sierra Club, a national
environmental group. ``But Bush's environmental track record _ you
know, he's running on empty.''
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, business groups say Bush was on the right
track before, when he said that science is still out on global
warming. A spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, for
example, said the group was ``surprised'' by Bush's new stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has sent a bit of shock wave through the
community,'' said Peggy Venable, spokeswoman for Texas Citizens for
a Sound Economy, which has fought curbs on greenhouse gases. ``It
is a wake-up call that many of us need to visit with the governor.
...''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he changed positions after meeting with advisers who
agree there is ``some warming, but disagree about its cause and
impact.'' Asked what the state should do about global warming, he
said: ``I presume reducing (nitrogen oxides) and (carbon dioxides)
will help.'' Both are considered greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
   The governor did not say who advised him on global warming. But
the head of the New York-based Environmental Defense Fund met with
Bush in late March and the two discussed the issue, officials with
the organization said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked him to try to get the best scientific briefing he
could from a broad range of scientists and evaluate the evidence
for himself, and not to rely upon what third parties were telling
him,'' said Jim Marston, director of the Texas Environmental
Defense Fund branch.
</P>
<P>
   He characterized the meeting with the Environmental Defense
Fund's chief executive officer as part of Bush's effort to ``reach
out'' to various groups and industries as he ponders a run for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers have theorized that Bush is trying to enhance his
environmental record in anticipation of a presidential match-up
with Democratic Vice President Al Gore, who has made environmental
issues a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   Bush sidestepped a question about Gore at a news conference
Wednesday, although he said the environment should be a major issue
in 2000. He told reporters that people ought to ask whether he has
improved air quality in Texas. Bush called that his top ecological
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have got to ask the question: Is the air cleaner
since I became the governor? And the answer is yes,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say the answer is no.
</P>
<P>
   Tom ``Smitty'' Smith, head of the consumer group Public Citizen,
said the Environmental Protection Agency recently rejected the
state's clean-air program for North Texas. The EPA action marked
the first time that federal officials have threatened any Texas
area with economic penalties for Clean Air Act violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the whole, he's had a pretty dismal record,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith applauded Bush's efforts to limit the scope of a
proposed nuclear waste dump, and he praised the governor's support
of legislation that would reduce industrial pollution, though not
as much as environmentalists want.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Bush has endorsed a provision in the electric
utility restructuring bill that would require utility companies to
reduce emissions at ``grandfathered'' industrial plants, facilities
that have been exempt from modern clean-air laws for more than two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had earlier supported voluntary efforts to bring
grandfathered plants under modern clean-air rules.

 &HT;    Fans survive wait for `Phantom Menace'
 &HT;    By Hank Stuever
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ You wonder if they'll miss one another, now that
it's over.
</P>
<P>
   By sundown Tuesday, a sort of giddy calm radiated from the
asphalt. The people who waited (and waited, and then waited) in
line to be the first people in the first screening in the biggest
and loudest movie auditorium in town, had all (almost all) been
home for a shower. Some had applied red-and-black Darth Maul
makeup. One girl _ alas, just one _ had the Princess Leia 'do.
</P>
<P>
   In the remaining hours before the midnight unveiling of ``Star
Wars: Epis_'' (must we really type it out for you one more time?),
they were just happy to have lived to see the final moment.
Thunderstorms Monday night ripped away most of what was left of
Tent City on the north face of the Metropolitan cinema, a 14-screen
mammoth in South Austin that, for a time, was their home. Together
they survived it all: rain, heat, KFC chicken wings and even the
obnoxious morning deejays who came by to ``interview'' them, only
to poke fun at their love lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a lot of friends,'' said Logan Campbell, 21, in a
reflective state of mind, a Darth Vader mask pushed up over his
forehead, while all around him plastic lightsaber duels playfully
unfolded. ``We made a lot of enemies, too.''
</P>
<P>
   There were tensions about who was really first in line, and who
saved who a place. There always were. Campbell was always exactly
second, having camped out at the Metropolitan since May 1. In front
of him were Mark Okun, 20, and Brian Couch, 20, but somehow, in
life's crazy shuffle, Couch wound up a few places back.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell and his friends know what you're thinking, because
they've heard it on TV and they read it in a newspaper editorial
and more than enough people have yelled it at them from passing
cars: Get a life.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell says it wasn't like they were all here 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   OK, yes it was, only they did it in shifts, all the while having
a life. They managed to finish classes, work at least one job, go
to Lamaze refresher courses, get to kids' soccer games, follow
Kosovo, get to dialysis appointments _ just for a few examples.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have lives _ nice lives,'' said Gloria Okun, 48, who
waited with her son and daughter toward the front of the line for
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday it was evident that ``Star Wars'' was going to be a
reality after all. Film canisters were delivered in the morning and
a crowd of Starwoids went running for the deliveryman, just to look
at them. ``I said, 'Oh no, no, no! Don't ruin the movie!''' Gloria
Okun said. Before noon, theater management handed out 150 ``seating
passes'' to ticket holders who wanted first choice of seats at the
12:01 show. By nightfall, your self-worth was determined by whether
or not you had the assistant manager's initials on the back of your
ticket, enabling you to be among the first 50 or so fans let in. By
now, a couple of thousand people were lined up and cordoned off by
police tape, ready for four different wee-hour showings. It felt
like the biggest moment of their lives _ something between a bowl
game, a rock concert, a wedding and a spiritual revival. ``No!
Sleep! Til! 'Star Wars'!'' the crowd chanted.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, there had to be police, and naturally, they were
serenaded with ``The Imperial March'' by the crowd. A petite,
shrill-voiced female officer lined up the 12:01 crowd one by one.
Mark Okun rested on a cement ashtray at the first place in line.
``It's almost here,'' he said. TV cameras zoomed in on him, and he
self-consciously removed his broken wire-frame glasses, fully aware
of this fleeting fame.
</P>
<P>
   After an almost ceremonial ticket-tearing, Okun, Campbell and
their friends chose seats in the center of the back row. The entire
theater screamed at everything: They screamed when the lights went
down. They screamed at the THX logo. But as those familiar yellow
words traveled across a sea of stars, there was a churchlike hush.
Already it was the best movie they've ever seen, whether it really
was or not.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, Campbell said the movie was ``a little slow,''
but he said it in almost a whisper. He was already thinking about
getting on with a life. ``So now what?'' he asked.

 &HT;    Fans' praise for `Menace' not universal, but close
 &HT;    By Staff reports

   DAYTON, Ohio _ We asked fans to call in with their own reviews,
and here's what some of you said:
</P>
<P>
   It's everything I expected and more! I was amazed at the
diversity of the crowd at the 12:01 a.m. show _ young and old, male
and female, long-time fans and newcomers, all left speechless for
much of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   The special effects, action sequences and comedy will satisfy
those just looking to be entertained. Long-time fans will find new
characters to love (and fear!), familiar faces in different
settings, and new questions to ponder.
</P>
<P>
   I know my opinion as a ``Star Wars'' fanatic is biased (my
sister and I have seen the first movie so many times we stopped
counting), but I saw ``Episode I'' with a nonfan friend who enjoyed
it, too. Basically, I'm ready for ``Episode II'' now. In the
meantime, maybe I'll see this one a few more times
</P>
<P>
   _ Angela Mullins, Oxford
</P>
<P>
   I saw the first showing of ``The Phantom Menace'' at the
Beavercreek Cinemas last night. The movie has everything a movie
needs and more.
</P>
<P>
   It is a little slow at the beginning but hey _ all great sagas
need a beginning, and ``Phantom'' is the perfect way to begin the
``Star Wars'' Saga. I'll be sure to go again and again.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, it's a movie the whole family can enjoy together.
And that is something hard to come by in the world today.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jason Streiff, Beavercreek
</P>
<P>
   I just returned from seeing the first showing at 12:01. The
experience of being at the theater waiting for the movie to start
was half the fun. All three networks had reporters there, there was
a myriad of people dressed up. An entire battalion of Storm
Troopers escorted Darth Vader through the theater, as various Jedi
and an abundance of Darth Maul lookalikes roamed freely and posed
for pictures. There was even a balloon guy making lightsabers, and
Darth Maul's double-bladed lightsaber staff out of balloons for
people.
</P>
<P>
   The movie itself was absolutely amazing. ``The Phantom Menace''
had me on the edge of my seat for two hours. The movie will answer
so many questions and start to explain many things leading into the
``Star Wars'' we all know, but it will also leave you asking many
more questions. There are some who will pick it apart and
concentrate on all the effects or how things were done. I do not
believe these people will enjoy the movie as much. Sit back, allow
yourself to once again be engulfed into the world George Lucas
captured us with so long ago, and this movie will be everything we
have waited 16 years for.
</P>
<P>
   _ Zak S. Blom, Ohio State University student from Springboro
</P>
<P>
   What can I say that won't be said countless times? Well, in a
word, stunning. Who knew from watching the trilogy that George
Lucas was capable of such beauty? From the sweeping vistas of the
desert planet Tatooine to the underwater splendor of the Gungan
city on Naboo, nearly every moment took my breath away. Plot,
characters and believability aside (all of which I found equally
wonderful), this movie will surely be hailed as one of the most
visually stunning ever created. Now don't get me wrong, the story
was exciting, the characters were interesting to say the least. But
I will always remember my first true glimpse into George Lucas'
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lisa Anne Shininger, Wright State University student from
Oakwood
</P>
<P>
   In 1983 Virginia (my wife) and I practiced law together in the
old Cooper Building at Second and Main streets in downtown Dayton.
That spring when the ``Return of the Jedi'' premiered, we closed
the office for the afternoon, left our 7-month-old daughter Lilly
at day care and went to the opening day showing at the Dayton Mall.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly never forgave us for leaving her behind in 1983, so in
1999 there was no way she was going to miss the first day showing
of ``Episode I.'' She worked Virginia and me until we gave in to
the 16 years of ```Star Wars' Guilt'' and purchased tickets for the
6 a.m. showing at Showcase Cinemas in Huber Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Our kids went to bed earlier than on Christmas Eve, and when the
alarm clock rang at 5 a.m., they were ready. Lilly and her friend,
Katie Lesko (both sophomores at Chaminade-Julienne High School) and
my sons, Frank (seventh grade) and Marty (third grade) and Eddie
(prekindergarten), who are Corpus Christi students, piled into the
van and we blasted off to witness ``Star Wars'' history.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of room at the showing with just a few
``in-costume'' customers. The kids and I rated the movie,
``Great!'' ``Awesome!'' ``Well worth missing school for!'' ``See
again, Daddy!'' Virginia gave it a ``Good but needing a Harrison
Ford/Han Solo-type character.''
</P>
<P>
   My vote for best scene of ``Episode I'' is when Jedi master
Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) introduces the boy, Anakin Skywalker (to
become Darth Vader), to the young Jedi, Obi-Wan Kenobi (will train
Anakin and be struck down by Vader). Now that's spine-tingling
entertainment. No special effects needed for that scene.
</P>
<P>
   We have photos of our family together in front of the Silverdome
for the 1994 World Cup and in front of the Olympic torch in Atlanta
in 1996, and now we have a family photo in front of Showcase
Cinemas for the opening of ``Episode I.'' What more can a Jedi
want-to-be father do for his children? (My wife says, ``Maybe
college?'')
</P>
<P>
   May the force be with you.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dan Gehres, Dayton
</P>
<P>
   I saw ``The Phantom Menace'' at 12:30 a.m. at Showcase Cinemas
in Huber Heights. I suppose that qualifies me as a ``die-hard''
fan, so you may want to take my comments with a grain of salt.
</P>
<P>
   I have never before been to a movie where the audience
applauded. At the very beginning, when the previews were over and
``Star Wars'' blazed across the screen, the theater erupted. It was
a very intense moment. After all the hype, all the waiting, we were
finally about to have it all unfold in front of us.
</P>
<P>
   I've heard that the reviews for ``The Phantom Menace'' have been
generally bad. I think all the hype was probably a bad thing for
this movie. People are going in expecting it to be this complete
knock-your-socks-off classic, and it's not. It's just a movie. Were
any of the original ``Star Wars'' films any different? The appeal
is not in any one of the movies by itself, but in the whole overall
story. I think people have lost sight of that.
</P>
<P>
   That being said, I would have to say ``Episode I'' is hard to
judge without the context of ``Episodes II and III'' _ the story
isn't complete. However, taken as it is, I feel it is a highly
enjoyable movie. The visual effects are stunning. The lightsaber
duels with Darth Maul are unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointment may arise from the fact that the film moves a bit
slowly. It's supposed to move slowly. ``Episode I'' is mainly
back-story.... The whole story couldn't be told in just one movie.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good film. People just need to remember that it's a
movie, and nothing more. It's a good story, and more importantly,
it's the very beginnings of a great story. It's entertaining. Kids
will love it. It's fun, and that's the most important thing of all.
</P>
<P>
   There are disappointing things, to be sure. The character Jar
Jar is a little irritating to have such a large role in the
film.... I was personally disappointed that Darth Maul won't be
sticking around for at least one more movie.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, though, I think the disappointments can be overlooked.
More than anything else, the ``Star Wars'' saga is supposed to be
fun, and Episode I fits that requirement quite nicely.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jonathan Williams, Troy
</P>
<P>
   Attended the 12:30 a.m. showing in Centerville this morning. We
sat in the theater for over three hours waiting for the film to
begin. There were a few costumed characters, a lightsaber here and
there. A loud cheer erupted when the 20th Century Fox logo finally
flashed on the screen, followed by complete silence when the words
``A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away'' appeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phantom Menace'' does not quite capture the magic of the
first three ``Star Wars'' films. The audience identification with
the characters is not as strong, some of the scenes with young
Anakin are awkward and some of the alien characters' dialogue is
difficult to follow. However, the film is visually stunning. The
beauty of the palaces and underwater cities of Naboo, the pod race,
numerous lightsaber fights, and the climatic battle droid battle
all are spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   I could feel that the audience really wanted the film to succeed
_ I initially gave it a ``7'' (on a scale of 10), but as I have
thought about it today it's now at least an ``8'' and I intend to
see it again!
</P>
<P>
   _ Wayne Mathieu, a baby boomer from Beavercreek
</P>
<P>
   I wrote a poem, because I was unable to enjoy much of the
bright-eyed happiness in this movie because I have, in my years of
existence, grown too jaded, and this was kind of reflected by Lucas
in the explanation of ``magic'' in biological terms. And so I await
the more cynical portions of the trilogy eagerly (how sick is
that?):

</P>
<P>
   I went to the 4 a.m. showing. I was 6 when the original ``Star
Wars'' came out in 1977. The trilogy was a seminal experience of my
formative years, so I was very excited about seeing how the story
began. I'll give ``Phantom Menace'' a B/B-, good but not great. The
visuals and effects are outstanding and Jar Jar wasn't quite as
irritating as I feared, though he was definitely a minor annoyance.
He is indeed the love child of Roger Rabbit and Stepin Fetchit (as
one critic noted). The movie has about 1/1,000,000 of the emotional
resonance of the first trilogy as a whole, and maybe 1/10th of that
when compared to ``The Empire Strikes Back.'' But it's fun, and not
quite as juvenile as I expected. Lucas managed a pretty good
balance for young and older fans.
</P>
<P>
   I'm definitely looking forward to the next one.
</P>
<P>
   _ Brian Landa, Dayton
</P>
<P>
   I went to the 4 a.m. showing of ``Phantom Menace.'' Before you
think I'm crazy, I got off work at 3 a.m., so it was actually
pretty convenient. Regardless of the time, the showing still
appeared to be sold out, or at least very close.
</P>
<P>
   When the 20th Century Fox and Lucasfilm logos went up on the
screen, the audience cheered and applauded. I thought the movie was
simply spectacular. It is unbelievable how many special effects are
in this movie. It is hard to believe this didn't cost more to make
than it did. Every scene was exquisitely crafted. The story draws
many parallels to the original movie. Jar Jar Binks is not as
annoying as we were led to believe. He may have been difficult to
understand at times, and his humor may have been somewhat juvenile,
but he didn't drag the movie down.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, this was a fantastic production. I think it's safe
to say that ``Titanic'' will sink again under the weight of ``The
Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Jeffrey W. Reger, Kettering
</P>
<P>
   I didn't form an opinion about ``Episode 1'' before I actually
went to see it this morning. I didn't want to be disappointed if it
wasn't all that I'd hoped for it to be.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas outdid himself with the computer-generated scenes. He did
things he could only imagine in the past. He pulled off some
incredible scenes, namely the Podrace. The effects were everything
I could have hoped for them to be.
</P>
<P>
   I also think Lucas did a pretty good job of casting the
characters. All of the people seemed to fit their roles very well.
</P>
<P>
   One of the movie's only weak points was the acting in some of
the scenes. But to any avid ``Star Wars'' fan it won't make a hill
of difference.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, I would say the movie was a definite success. My
viewing pleasure was made complete by ``Boba Fett'' sitting just to
the right of me.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sarah in Beavercreek
</P>
<P>
   As a Cincinnati native now living in Florida, I got to
experience the Orlando side of ``The Phantom Menace.'' Ticket sales
down here were psychotic; our big multiplex had a line of more than
400 people. Opening night was a great experience, all the fans were
very friendly, and we all swapped stories about the previous three
and rumors about this one.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting thing about the film was that I think it is
the first great film I have seen that doesn't meet my expectations.
Everyone goes in with a preconceived notion of how it should be,
and then we feel slighted on the way out that it doesn't do
everything we want it to. We are the people this movie was not
intended for, it is intended for the wide eyes child who is looking
to be lost in a galaxy far, far away, and not a cynical older
person who can beat ``Star Wars'' Trivial Pursuit without missing a
question (me). So, when I break the shackles of that off, I find
the movie is fantastic. It knows it is part 1 of 6 (possibly 9),
and does a great job setting up the stories to come.

activities of a secret Guatemalan military unit that kidnapped,
tortured and executed Guatemalans during the early 1980s as part of
a campaign against leftists. Human rights advocates in Guatemala
and the United States say the log book is the most detailed
document about military abuses ever obtained from Guatemalan army

All around the country, farmers are about to finish sowing millions
of acres of a genetically altered form of corn that protects itself
from pests by producing a toxin in its tissues. But researchers
report that this increasingly popular transgenic plant, thought to
be harmless to non- pest insects, produces a wind- borne pollen
that can kill monarch butterflies. (Sara Krulwich/New York Times

Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., left, and Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla.,
discuss the juvenile justice bill in the hallway outside the Senate
floor Wednesday. After several days of escalating feuds between
Republicans and Democrats, the Senate pulled back from the brink of
a partisan meltdown late Wednesday and seemed poised for a final

Friars baseball team shake their hats. Last October, Philip Smith,
the school's president, announced that baseball, men's golf and
tennis would be eliminated from the varsity athletic program,
saying that the cuts were made in order to comply with gender

   (NYT19) BEDFORD, N.Y. -- May 19, 1999 -- QUICK-REFURBISH-1, 5-19
-- It took 170 experts just six weeks to renovate the Gesser house.
``These guys took the ball and ran,'' says Barry Gesser, a single,
35-year-old hedge-fund manager. Million-dollar decorating marathons
have become a fact of life for many designers catering to the

McPherson's ``This Lime Tree Bower,'' at Primary Stages. The story,
which unfolds in alternating monologues by three men, hasn't been
done many favors by the uncomfortable production that opened last
night at Primary Stages. But McPherson's language is potent enough
to survive even this sadly awkward rendering. (Sara Krulwich/New

   (NYT16) NEW YORK -- May 19, 1999 -- HISS-APARTMENT-3, 5-19 --
Alger Hiss in 1930 and letters he wrote his family from prison. The
letters will be a surprise to those who saw only the public Alger
Hiss, who, even in his son's view, projected a cold and lawyerly
aspect. They are wildly playful and supportive of his young son,
who was 9 when his father went to jail and 13 when he came out.

Tony Hiss in his boyhood room, now his son's. Alger Hiss' apartment
- still in the family - is in a time warp. When the building's
super wanted to replace the toilet - a period piece with a round
tank and a tiny brass lever in the middle that says, ``Push,'' the
Hisses wrote to the landlord in protest. ``This toilet belongs in
the Smithsonian,'' they say. (Fred R. Conrad/New York Times Photo)

Tony Hiss in the courtyard of his apartment, where everything is as
it was when his father, Alger, lived there. ``Much of what is here
is what they brought with them from Washington, full of optimism,''
Hiss explains. ``The desk, the sofa, the piano, the table, the
chair, the same green enamel kitchen table where I read his prison
letters when I was 11 and where I read the same letters again last
year.'' (Fred R. Conrad/New York Times Photo)

Tayar, right, with Roy Liebenthal, at Pop. The restaurant, which
opened in April, is much more than just a deafeningly hot eatery
with no sign in front. According to its menu, ``Pop is based on the
post-war social idealism and trust in technological innovation,
mass production and pre-fabrication. The author is Tayar, the
architect who conceived this 2,500-square-foot temple of
retro-contempo chic. (Fred R. Conrad/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT12) UNDATED -- May 19, 1999 -- HOME-IMPROVEMENT-B&AMP;W, 5-19 --
Sometimes sink leaks can be corrected by tightening or replacing a
slip washer on one of the joints. Usually, however, the drips occur
because one of the pipes has corroded and is no longer watertight.
If one pipe is corroded, the others will soon deteriorate, so it is
best to replace the entire drain assembly. While this may sound
complicated, it is an easy repair that any do-it-yourselfer can
make. (Edward R. Lipinski/New York Times Illustration) LITE

drenched in water while operating. Heavier (up to 25 pounds), more
costly (some models start at $8,000) and generally less technically
sophisticated, ``rugged'' models are to ordinary laptops what the
Hummer is to the family car. (Jeff Green/New York Times Photo)

the 1916 excavation by a Harvard archeologist, which took these and
other items, as a desecration of holy ground. (Janet Knott/Boston

ARLINGTON, Texas _ Royce Clayton is expected to be back at
shortstop and Juan Gonzalez in right field Friday when the Rangers
open a six-game road trip in Baltimore.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I'd say Clayton is 100 percent and Juan is 99 percent,''
manager Johnny Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton is on the disabled list because of a muscle tear behind
his right shoulder. He played for Triple-A Oklahoma on a
medical-rehabilitation assignment Monday, and went 1-for-5 while
playing all nine innings.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez missed his seventh consecutive game yesterday because
of a strained right hamstring. He has been running on a treadmill
and in the Rangers' indoor pool to strengthen it. Crabtree pitching
well Tim Crabtree lowered his earned-run average from 8.44 to 3.07
with 92/3 scoreless innings in his past 11 appearances, including
21/3 innings Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crabby's getting better every day,'' manager Johnny Oates
said.
</P>
<P>
   The right-handed reliever hit 97 mph on the Rangers' radar gun
Tuesday, the best for anyone on the staff this season. He had hit
95 six times. His slider also has been effective.
</P>
<P>
   Although his ERA was high before the scoreless streak, Crabtree
has had only two bad outings this year. He gave up a total of five
runs in two outings, April 7 and 22. He wasn't scored on in his
other 15 games. Double trouble There are two ways to look at the
Rangers' propensity for hitting into double plays.
</P>
<P>
   One is that you have to have a good offense to do it as
frequently as the Rangers, who have grounded into 47 double plays,
more than any other major-league team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way you can hit into a double play is if you've got
someone on base,'' manager Johnny Oates said. ``When you hit hard
ground balls at someone with runners on base, you're going to get
double plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The other is that the Rangers aren't patient enough with those
runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes double plays are created when you swing at pitchers'
pitches,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be the case with Ivan Rodriguez, who leads the
league by grounding into 11 double plays.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, with only four walks in 141 at-bats, tends to swing
at pitches out of the strike zone. Frequently those become hits;
the catcher has a .326 average. Sometimes, they become double
plays.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the double plays, the Rangers are fourth in the
league with 235 runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is how many runs you score,'' Oates said.
``No, change that. It's where you are in the standings at the end
of the year.''
Dransfeldt back down Rookie shortstop Kelly Dransfeldt will stay in
Arlington when the team leaves Friday for the road trip to
Baltimore and Tampa Bay, and was told he will be optioned back to
Triple-A Oklahoma. The Rangers want to make 100 percent certain
that Clayton is ready before officially making the move.
</P>
<P>
   Dransfeldt earned rave reviews for his defense during his first
16 games in the majors but hit .189.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just getting this experience is important,'' he said. ``For
the first time in the majors, I'm pleased. I'm a little
disappointed in my offense, though.''
Briefly Ivan Rodriguez was back in the lineup for the day game
Wednesday after playing the night before. Catchers usually get a
rest during a day game after a night game, but Rodriguez played
because the Rangers are off Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McLemore, who left Tuesday's game in the top of the fourth
inning because of stiffness in his left knee, did not start
Wednesday. Oates said McLemore could have played, but decided to
use the off day to give him two days of rest. McLemore pinch-hit in
the eighth inning. Long-ball contest Wednesday, Tampa Bay's Paul
Sorrento hit the longest home run in the history of The Ballpark in
Arlington. The top 12: Player, Team Opponent Distance Date 1. Paul

 NEW YORK: about it.''

<P>
   Wernick said that Volpe, who is 27, also gave him a report on
the street melee that had led to the arrest of Louima and a second
Haitian immigrant, Patrick Antoine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said there was a big fight outside some club, they were
acting like animals,'' the sergeant said Volpe had told him. He
said Volpe reorted that ``he got punched in the face, chased a
couple of people and caught somebody, but wasn't sure if it was the
guy'' who punched him.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe is also charged with beating Antoine, who had not been
involved in the melee, as he walked on a street near the nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe's laywer, Marvyn M. Kornberg is expected to begin cross-
examining Wernick on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wernick took the stand, Antoine testified. In addition to
giving his version of his encounter with Volpe, Antoine told the
jury of statements the officer had made to him as he took him to
the same stationhouse restroom where prosecutors say Louima had
been attacked shortly before.
</P>
<P>
   The statements, as recounted by Antoine _ who testified in
Creole through an interpreter, though he said he understood English
_ included an apology to Antoine for having beaten him in the
street and an admission by Volpe that he had been acting
irrationally that morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me why was I following this guy,'' Antoine said,
apparently referring to someone else Volpe and other officers had
been chasing near the melee when Antoine walked by.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I did not know what he was talking about, that I
was just going home and that he beat me,'' Antoine continued,
adding that Volpe ``then said he's sorry, he was feeling crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, Antoine testified, the officer ``told me he
was like somebody who was going crazy,'' and that ``when somebody
hits him, he hits the person back.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say that after Louima was arrested, Volpe, Schwarz
and the two other officers on trial, Thomas Wiese and Thomas
Bruder, beat him in a police car before Volpe and Schwarz attacked
him with the stick in the restroom at the police station. All four
are charged with violating Louima's civil rights. A fifth defendant
in the trial, Sgt. Michael Bellomo, is charged with trying to cover
up the reported beating in the police car.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg, suggested in questioning Antoine that he had
misunderstood the officer's words during the conversation in
English. The lawyer also got Antoine to acknowledge that even
though he identified Volpe in court as the one who he said had
beaten him in the street, he had not had time to get a good look at
that officer.

SHORT-TERM TREASURY RATES STEADY AS LONGER-TERM RATES TUMBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rates on short-term Treasury securities held steady
Wednesday, while longer-term rates fell sharply, as investors
seemed to send a vote of confidence _ at least for now _ to the
Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Fed policy-makers said Tuesday that they were leaning toward
raising rates to slow economic growth and curb inflation. Although
they did not actually raise their interest rate target, which is
now 4.75 percent, the warning is now official.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of a rate increase by the central bank had been one
of the reasons for the recent bond market selloff that sent
long-term rates up to 5.92 percent, their highest in a year. But by
Tuesday, traders and strategists said, investors were concluding
two things: that the selloff had probably gone too far, and with
the Fed ready to move, the inflationary threat was less serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's more confidence in the Fed,'' said Thomas Connor,
head government trader at J.P. Morgan Securities. ``They've got
their eye on the ball here.''
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year bond, which is very sensitive to
inflationary expectations, rose 1 2/32, to 92 7/32, while the
yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.80 percent
from 5.88 percent Tuesday. The recent high, 5.92 percent, was
Friday, when inflationary fears were heightened by the report that
the Consumer Price Index jumped 0.7 percent in April, the largest
monthly increase in eight and a half years.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the two-year note was unchanged at 5.43 percent,
and the yield on December futures on the federal funds rate, which
is the Fed's target rate, slipped to 5.15 percent from 5.17
percent.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean that investors think the Fed can avoid
raising interest rates to curb inflation. In fact, the yield on the
December futures indicates they expect as much as half a percentage
point increase by then.
</P>
<P>
   But if interest rates hold the line, it would show that
investors expect the Fed to succeed in curbing inflationary
pressures without having to raise interest rates significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Berner, the chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, is forecasting a jump in the Fed funds rate of half a
percentage point by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Berner said bond investors might have been heartened by the
recent decline in commodity prices, especially oil. Wednesday, the
price of oil for June on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 23
cents, to $16.88, its first dip below $17 since mid-April. Some
industrial metal prices, including copper, have also declined
recently, after strong rallies this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Berner added that the dollar's new rally against the yen might
be a signal that more Japanese investors will resume buying
Treasury bonds, which would help alleviate the upward pressure on
rates.
</P>
<P>
   But rates are sure to bounce around for a while as new data on
growth and prices are released. Oil prices could turn around again,
as some analysts are predicting. And a revival in global economic
growth could send other commodity prices up again. Any indication
that inflationary pressures are increasing will probably push rates
higher, as investors speculate on when the central bank will
finally pull the trigger.

ADVERTISING: LANDS' END'S CYBERCATALOG IS FOCUS OF NEW CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Wis.)  (bl)  
 By PATRICIA WINTERS LAURO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The longtime New York editor Lee Eisenberg said he felt as if he
were on Neptune when he first landed in Dodgeville, Wis., last
March to become the top creative executive for Lands' End Inc.
catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   So it is only appropriate that the first big advertising effort
under Eisenberg is promoting Lands' End in another realm. In
cyberspace, that is.
</P>
<P>
   The apparel company's entire ad budget through November,
estimated at $15 million, seeks to sell its Web site,
www.landsend.com, in a TV, print and Internet advertising campaign
created by Biederman, Kelly, Krimstein &AMP; Partners in New York. Even
its June catalog cover is devoted to explaining how its site works.
</P>
<P>
   Lands' End's effort to establish itself among the first direct
apparel merchants to offer a comprehensive and, most importantly,
``fun'' _ Web site. But it is hardly alone. While few if any in the
estimated $93 billion catalog industry are advertising their Web
sites in a big way, some 75 percent of all catalog retailers now
operate Web sites, according to the Direct Marketing Association, a
trade group in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign comes after a disappointing fiscal year in which
net income dropped 51 percent, to $31.2 million, for the year ended
Jan. 29. The company attributed the income drop to product price
cuts paired with a dramatic increase in costly catalog
distribution. This year, as it increases its Web presence, it will
reduce the size of its catalogs and cut catalog circulation.
</P>
<P>
   For the first quarter, ended April 30, sales were up 7.8
percent, to $290 million, and net income was $6.5 million, up from
$5.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Lands' End is hoping to get a strong position on the Web before
it gets more competitive _ ``which will be very soon,'' said Katey
Muldoon, president of Muldoon &AMP; Baer, catalog consultants in
Sugarloaf Key, Fla. Muldoon has done work for the Lands' End
competitor L.L. Bean. But just throwing up a Web site is not
enough. The key to getting the attention of consumers is to be
entertaining, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, the Lands' End TV spots promote its Web site's singular,
service-oriented features such as a ``Suit Finder'' icon that shows
women the swimsuits that look best on their body type, and ``Oxford
Express,'' a tool to help men find the right dress shirt. Swimsuits
and dress shirts are both big sellers for Lands' End.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit of eye candy,'' said Ken Krimstein,
Biederman's chief creative officer, in explaining the Web site
features, ``and there will be lots of these types of innovations.
It's part of the philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   The direct-mail industry is focusing on the Web as the wave of
the future for obvious reasons: Internet sales are exploding.
Lands' End said it had $61 million in Web site sales for the year
ended in January, up from $18 million, and some 20 percent were new
customers, which is important in the saturated catalog market.
</P>
<P>
   Industrywide, catalog sales on the Web have jumped from $6
million in 1993 to an estimated $9.4 billion today as more people
go online, according to the Direct Marketing Association, which
projects sales will explode to $36 billion within three years.
</P>
<P>
   The direct mail industry is also a natural fit for Web marketing
because catalogers already have the fulfillment and customer
service infrastructure to handle Internet sales, said Amy
Blankenship, an association spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense; they're doing the same things they have always
done in print,'' she said, adding that entire sections of its
annual conference this year are devoted to e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason to promote the Web is that it is cheaper to sell
on the Web than to send out the estimated 250 million catalogs each
year that Lands' End distributes.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not mean the company is abandoning print, said
Eisenberg, whose career has included stints as an editor at Time
Inc. and as the editor of Esquire magazine. Eisenberg said his job
was to expand on Lands' End's already established reputation for
entertaining and thought-provoking content, whether that be on the
Web or in its monthly catalog. Writers new to the catalog include
the humorist Bruce McCall and the art critic Robert Hughes, and
Eisenberg said he was also working with the New York designer
Milton Glaser to develop some design ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Lands' End is already sort of a New Yorker of catalog companies,
offering features from writers ranging from Garrison Keillor to
William Least Heat Moon amid pages of products about warm woolens
and highlander twills. The articles are intended to entertain and
inform and are totally unrelated to Lands' End products.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Eisenberg said that given the demographic profile of
its customers _ who tend to be affluent and educated _ he saw the
catalog (and the Web site, where there is no space limitation) as a
place for great writing.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a guest copywriter series where authors write about
Lands' End products has generated interest in the publishing
industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that the January issue, in which the best-selling
author Elmore Leonard was featured on the cover and wrote about
Pinpoint shirts, touched off a wave of phone calls to Eisenberg
from publishers who wanted their authors to write for Lands' End.
Leonard wrote that his character Chili Palmer in ``Get Shorty''
(who was played by John Travolta in the film of the same name)
wears a silky cotton Pinpoint in his new book ``Be Cool.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They know or intuitively realize that it's a great place to
promote books,'' Eisenberg said. ``It may not be Oprah, but it does
a similar thing.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his feeling of being in outer space, Eisenberg said he is
now seeing Wisconsin as home, and is moving his wife and two
children there in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't used to the wide-open space of the prairie, but as it
has greened up there, its beautiful,'' he said.

REFEREE FINDS DISNEY BREACHED KATZENBERG PACT
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Calif.)  (rk) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The referee presiding over Jeffrey Katzenberg's
contentious lawsuit against the Walt Disney Co. ruled Wednesday
that Disney had breached its contract with him and that he had not
forfeited his bonus by leaving Disney before his contract expired.
</P>
<P>
   The referee, Paul G. Breckenridge Jr., a retired California
superior court judge, did not rule on how much money Disney owes
Katzenberg, who was its studio chief. That will be decided after
the next phase of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday's ruling means that Katzenberg will be entitled to
interest payments on whatever that amount is. Since Katzenberg is
seeking at least $250 million, the interest alone could reach tens
of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Other parts of the ruling Wednesday went Disney's way. In
particular, the referee found that there was no fraud on Disney's
part.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg sued contending that he was owed a bonus based on all
future profits of Disney movies made in the 10 years that he ran
the studio _ movies like ``The Lion King,'' ``Beauty and the
Beast'' and ``Aladdin.''
</P>
<P>
   The case, sometimes dubbed Katz vs. Mouse, has captivated
Hollywood as a spectacle of greed and of unbridled animosity
between two industry titans, Katzenberg and his former boss,
Michael D. Eisner, the chairman of Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg left Disney in anger in 1994 after Eisner declined to
promote him to the No. 2 position after the death of the company
president, Frank Wells, in a helicopter crash. Katzenberg, who then
started the Dreamworks SKG studio with Steven Spielberg and David
Geffen, has contended that Disney denied him his bonus because of
the personal animosity of Eisner.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling did not refer to any personal animosity. Yet even
Wednesday, the parties battled over the interpretation of the
ruling, with both declaring victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I'm thrilled,'' said Bert Fields, the attorney for
Katzenberg. John Dreyer, the chief spokesman for Disney, said,
``We're extremely pleased with the court's ruling.'' Both said a
court order prohibited them from discussing the case.
</P>
<P>
   Disney, in a settlement, had already paid Katzenberg an amount
that is said to be $117 million. Nevertheless, Eisner contended in
the trial that Katzenberg had agreed to forfeit a substantial bonus
by leaving the company before his contract ended. And Disney
contended that it had not breached the contract and did not have to
pay interest.
</P>
<P>
   But Breckenridge wrote in his seven-page opinion that his review
had led to the ``inescapable conclusion (at least to the referee)''
that Katzenberg had not forfeited his bonus by failing to extend
the terms of his employment. He said Katzenberg was entitled to
``good faith and fair dealing'' from Disney.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Disney was obliged to pay the bonus on or about
Oct. 1, 1994, and that a breach of contract occurred on that date.
But he left for later the decision on what date the interest owed
to Katzenberg began accruing.
</P>
<P>
   Breckenridge also said that Katzenberg's bonus should include
profits from some types of merchandise based on movies and that
Disney had breached its fiduciary duty by not accounting to
Katzenberg for this.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the ruling more favorable to Disney said that
calculation of Katzenberg's bonus should not include proceeds from
Club Disney, which are urban play centers. It also said profits
from ``Toy Story 2'' should be calculated based on a contract
favored by Disney, though the referee left this matter partly open.
</P>
<P>
   Breckenridge also said Katzenberg was not entitled to any
royalty for promotional uses of movies or characters online. But he
said that some online uses that produce measurable revenue to
Disney could be included in the calculation.
</P>
<P>
   There has been some surprise in Hollywood that Disney did not
settle the suit completely before it went to trial, thereby
allowing the company's internal affairs to be made public.
Katzenberg and his attorney, Fields, appear to have taken advantage
of the opportunity to embarrass Eisner at the trial, which began
April 26.

   At one point, Fields confronted Eisner with notes taken by the
ghostwriter of Eisner's autobiography. According to those notes,
Eisner had said of Katzenberg, ``I think I hate the little
midget.''

<P>
   For its part, the Disney side argued that live action films made
under Katzenberg's tenure were $231 million in the red when he left
the company, a rebuke to Katzenberg's image as a Hollywood whiz.

`PHANTOM' OBLITERATES DAY-ONE RECORD

   LOS ANGELES _ The Force lived up to the hype as it rewrote the
record books Wednesday, taking in an estimated $42 million at 2,970
theaters for the first day of ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom
Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're tracking most of the early shows at 98 percent capacity
and it wasn't much less for the other shows,'' said Robert
Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source tracking service. ``Some
owners are saying every seat was packed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think $42 million sounds right,'' agreed Barry Hyman, an
analyst with Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. ``By the time you're done
with the first two weeks, you're looking at $200 million. This is
clearly not `Ishtar.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The final first-day figure, which will not be released by 20th
Century Fox until today, is estimated to have topped the previous
one-day record of $26.1 million _ set by ``The Lost World: Jurassic
Park'' two years ago _ by more than 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like it's far beyond our expectations,'' said Fox
executive Tom Sherak.
</P>
<P>
   Goosing the total was the move by 2,010 theaters to stage 12:01
a.m. screenings; 120 of those offered shows at 3 a.m. and 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Patronage for the $115 million extravaganza, replete with George
Lucas' never-before-seen digital effects, was strong in major
metropolitan areas. ``In big cities, being there on opening day is
such a big deal, so almost all the Los Angeles and New York
showings were sold out,'' Bucksbaum said. ``To get 98 percent
attendance is just unheard of.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler Wood, head film buyer for Pacific Theaters, said all 51
of the chain's late-morning showings sold out. ``There were a lot
of young kids with families, a lot of people in costume and a lot
of applause,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Loews Cineplex executive Marc Pascucci said the majority of
Wednesday ``Phantom Menace'' shows at the chain's 200 theaters with
prints were sold out. ``The majority today were true fanatics,'' he
added. ``I think we'll be pretty close to capacity through
Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum said 75 percent of the audience was comprised of males
between 15 and 25. He held to his prediction of $375 million to
$410 million in final grosses and $135 million in the first five
days with $22 million today, $27 million Friday, $26 million
Saturday and $18 million Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Trackers also said less-than-glowing reviews had not hurt
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like Lucas, the studios and exhibitors know that
critics occupy a culture that's disjointed from popular culture,''
said Kevin Skislock of Laguna Research Partners. ``Lucas has a very
powerful connection with popular culture because he's created such
a compelling story. It all started in the original with the bar
scene where Luke meets Han Solo.''

TELECOM ITALIA TAKES ITS CASE TO BIG FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Telecom Italia made a last-minute bid Wednesday to lure
big shareholders who are undecided about whether to accept a
hostile $65 billion takeover bid from Olivetti over a friendly
merger deal with Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   With two days to go before the Olivetti bid expires, Telecom
Italia's chief executive, Franco Bernabe, reached out to fund
managers and other big investors by conference call, promising to
share his company's wealth by spending more than $4 billion to buy
back 10 percent of its stock at prices as much as $3.70 a share
above the amount offered by Olivetti.
</P>
<P>
   An Olivetti victory would likely wreck the marriage of Telecom
Italia and Deutsche Telekom, former government monopolies that
together would create one of the world's biggest phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Bernabe, though sounding at times pressed and on the defensive,
made clear that investors who had offered Olivetti their shares by
Friday would be ineligible for the Telecom Italia buyback, if the
Olivetti bid failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who tendered will not benefit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday night, Olivetti had obtained 474.6 million
common shares, or only about 9 percent of Telecom Italia, the
nation's stock market reported. But big institutional shareholders,
which own most of Telecom Italia and will determine the outcome,
are not expected to formally decide until the Friday deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Paolo Catalfamo, managing director in Italy for the Templeton
funds, said that barring some startling development, ``we will
accept the Olivetti offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Most other big investors declined to disclose their preferences.
But the possibility of an Olivetti triumph was reflected on the
Milan exchange, where Telecom Italia's share price closed up 4.25
percent, at 9.927 euros, or $10.52.
</P>
<P>
   Especially large quantities of stock changed hands, apparently
driven in part by speculators acquiring Telecom Italia shares
Wednesday at less than 10 euros to offer them to Olivetti before
the week's end for a guaranteed 11.50 euros.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti, Italy's No. 2 phone service provider, stunned
investors earlier this year with its bold bid for Telecom Italia, a
company seven times its size. To deflect the bid, Bernabe has
resorted to a wide variety of maneuvers, notably the plan to merge
Telecom Italia into Deutsche Telekom in an all-stock deal that
values the Italian company's shares at $12.65, 46 cents more than
the Olivetti bid.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Olivetti have suggested that the percentage of
shares obtained by the Friday deadline may be higher than the stock
market statistics, though they have offered no firm evidence to
back that up.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti's chief executive, Roberto Colaninno, the quarterback
of the takeover attempt, said this week that the best holding for
Olivetti lay between 65 percent and 70 percent of Telecom Italia,
which he described as ``the ideal level between sustainability of
debt and full control of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   But an Olivetti adviser said that the ideal target might be
lower, at only 1 or 2 percentage points above 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti's bid consists of $12.19 a share _ 60 percent cash and
the rest in bonds and stock in Tecnost, an Olivetti subsidiary that
is being used for the acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   While Lehman Brothers has advised Olivetti on the bid, other
investment banks, notably Chase Manhattan and Mediobanca of Italy,
have raised almost $24 billion in financing for the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The Olivetti adviser said that if the challenger obtained less
than 50 percent, but more than 35 percent of Telecom Italia,
Olivetti would make a decision on whether to proceed with its
takeover attempt by Tuesday, taking into account such issues as the
effect on the rating of its bonds by a low result as well as the
legal implications. ``The situation is fluid and complex,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bernabe's conference call Wednesday appeared at least in part to
be in response to calls by fund managers for some gesture that
would make their loyalty worthwhile, such as a notably sweetened
offer from Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   But Deutsche Telekom's chief, Ron Sommer, has ruled this out.
Bernabe had hastily cobbled together the deal in hopes that
Deutsche Telekom would be the white knight to rescue Telecom Italia
from Olivetti.
</P>
<P>
   That union, however, has faced criticism since it was first
announced last month. Telecommunications analysts have questioned
the strategic and competitive benefits of the merger plan. Some
Italian government officials have expressed opposition because the
company would effectively be controlled by the German government,
which still holds a majority stake in Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti opened its bid for Telecom Italia with a strong pitch
to individual investors in Italy, who hold about 10 percent of the
shares, through an extensive campaign of newspaper ads. But few
appear to have come forward to offer their stock.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 70 percent of Telecom Italia shares are held by
institutional investors, including large funds in the United States
and Britain, and both Olivetti and Telecom Italia consider them to
be the crucial vote casters.
</P>
<P>
   With many fund managers refusing to disclose their plans so as
not to tip the outcome, many other investors have said that they
will only decide on Friday _ to allow Telecom Italia time for
last-minute offers and to judge the general sentiment in the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Joanna Dolmer, a fund manager at Standard Life Investments, the
asset management arm of Standard Life Assurance Co. of Britain,
said that ``we know our thoughts at the moment, and we know what
the bulk of the assumption in the market is,'' but that Standard
Life would wait until the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Just what impact Bernabe's offers Wednesday night would have
remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
   In the Telecom Italia conference call, Berardino Libonati,
Telecom Italia's chairman, repeated arguments that the Olivetti bid
violated the rights of holders of savings, or nonvoting shares, and
that Italian laws that limited shareholders to 3 percent when
Telecom Italia was taken public meant that unless Olivetti obtained
more than 50 percent plus one share, its voting rights would be
limited to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments by Libonati, a noted lawyer, suggested that unless
Olivetti secured a strong majority stake, the battle could shift to
the nation's courts. And, Libonati added, ``Any Italian lawyer can
tell you how long legal proceedings in Italy can last.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernabe said Telecom Italia would spend as much as $4.1 billion
to buy back as many as 720 million common shares, or 10 percent, at
a maximum $10.12 a share, and seek stockholder approval for a
second buyback at a maximum price of $15.90, if the Olivetti bid
failed.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Telecom Italia had the means to afford such
generosity, Bernabe responded that with annual operating profit of
almost $12 billion, ``we don't lack the financial capacity to do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But some fund managers reached in the conference call did not
appear impressed. ``Why are we here today?'' one asked. ``You could
have done this three weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Another fund manger accused Bernabe of punishing share owners
who decided to offer Olivetti their stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're penalizing shareholders who tendered,'' he said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ The possibility of an increase in U.S.
interest rates, as suggested by the Federal Reserve this week, is
unlikely to undermine the steady improvement in Latin America's
economic outlook, forecasters said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although fear of higher U.S. rates was partly responsible for
drops in Latin American stock markets, it was seen as a knee-jerk
reaction. More important, economists said, is the strengthening
momentum of Brazil, the region's largest economy, and the benefits
such strength can carry over to others.
</P>
<P>
   Reduced capital flows, the greatest concern facing Latin nations
if the Fed were to raise rates, did not fan fears at Brazil's
central bank, which continued cutting interest rates Wednesday,
this time to 23.5 percent from 27 percent. The reduction is the
seventh since January's devaluation of Brazil's currency, the real,
and reflects growing confidence at the bank that the nation can
withstand volatility generated from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new currency regime allows us to absorb external impacts
in a better way,'' said Octavio de Barros, chief economist here for
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya.
</P>
<P>
   De Barros contrasted the situation of Brazil with that of
Argentina, where a system that fixes the value of the peso to the
dollar limits the government's use of monetary policy to react to
foreign shocks.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most analysts agree that Argentina is the Latin American
country most susceptible to an increase in rates in the United
States, since it borrows so much abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, the second-biggest Latin American country, is largely
shielded from a U.S. rate increase for the same reason as Brazil,
since the government mainly borrows on domestic bond markets. Yet
Mexico, with nearly 90 percent of exports going to the United
States, could be hurt by weaker U.S. demand for its goods.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, only about a third of exports from the Mercosur
trade bloc, which comprises Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and
Uruguay, go to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Countries such as Chile would be insulated from higher U.S.
rates, largely since they are considered safer investments by
debt-rating agencies, said Walter Molano, chief Latin America
economist at BCP Securities in Greenwich, Conn. And Venezuela,
which has sent mixed signals to investors since President Hugo
Chavez took office in February, is partly protected from a rise in
American rates because of recent increases in the price of oil, the
country's main export.
</P>
<P>
   ``A rise in U.S. rates would probably get lost in the detail,''
said Arturo Porzecanski, global head of fixed-income research for
ING Barings in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that an increase could end up hurting Argentina the
most, since the government there is so dependent on international
capital markets for its borrowing needs. ``More than 90 percent of
Argentina's debt is denominated in currencies they cannot print and
cannot tax,'' Porzecanski said.
</P>
<P>
   On Latin American stock markets Wednesday, Argentina's benchmark
Merval index registered the deepest decline, falling 4.3 percent,
partly because of rumors that it would scrap the system that links
the peso to the dollar. The government denied this.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico City, the Bolsa index dropped 2.1 percent. Here in Sao
Paulo, Brazil's financial center, the Bovespa index declined 1.2
percent. Stocks were also down in Chile, Venezuela, Colombia and
Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Latin American equities become less attractive to foreign
investors when interest rates rise in the United States because of
improved returns on securities such as U.S. Treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
   While Brazil's central bank showed Wednesday that there is ample
room for it to stoke a recovery, there are still concerns over the
country's dependence on foreign capital flows. For instance, the
estimate for this year's trade surplus has fallen to about $4
billion from $11 billion, an illustration that the currency
devaluation has not done as much as once hoped to increase exports.
And the ability to finance debt would be made more difficult if
American rates rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil is an importer of capital so any increase in U.S. rates
is negative,'' said Jose Scheinkman, a professor of economics at
the University of Chicago. ``The only way to attack this problem in
a long-term way is for the government to curb spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Brazil has made substantial progress in narrowing it
budget deficit, before payments of interest on debt are taken into
account, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso was dealt a minor
setback this week in efforts to limit pension spending, when
congressional pressure led him to withdraw a decree creating a
minimum retirement age for some workers.

 &HT;    Glavine overcomes rough spot
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Outside of some scrambling in the fifth inning, Tom
Glavine came away from Wednesday's 7-3 win over the Pirates feeling
pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had too many big pitch counts,'' said Glavine who threw 118
pitches in seven innings, allowed five hits and three runs in
earning his third victory of the season. ``My stuff was good, my
stuff was live. There was only one inning I didn't feel all that
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   After bouncing into two double plays in the first four innings,
the Pirates used a hit-and-run to start something in the fifth. Ed
Sprague lined behind Ozzie Guillen on the play, allowing Kevin
Young to advance from first to third. A ground-out by Freddy Garcia
was enough to tie the game 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   With two out, Glavine walked No. 8 hitter Keith Osik to bring up
pitcher Francisco Cordova. But Cordova lined the first pitch to
right to score Sprague. A flare by Abraham Nunez gave the Pirates a
3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine allowed only a bloop hit over the next two innings and
recorded two of his five strikeouts. That finish and a Brian Jordan
grand slam enabled Glavine (3-4) to walk off with the third win in
his last five starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an indication that I'm getting back on track _ I can
have a bad inning or bad hitter or bad sequence,'' Glavine said.
``That's a whole lot better than earlier in the year. I'm getting
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Adaptable
</P>
<P>
   Giving Walt Weiss a day off Wednesday afternoon following
Tuesday's night game, the Braves used Guillen in the leadoff spot.
His .152 batting average and .152 on-base percentage made him a
strange candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Guillen, an admitted free swinger, said before the game he would
make an adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to see more pitches because I'm at the top of the
lineup,'' Guillen said. ``When you pinch-hit, the first good pitch
you see, you have to swing. I'll try to do the same things Walt did
the last couple days.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping to his word, Guillen found his way on base with a bloop
double to start the four-run rally in the sixth and took his first
walk of the season in the seventh. He scored two of the Braves'
seven runs.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tom Glavine knew a little something about Brian
Jordan's stinginess with two strikes from when he pitched against
him when Jordan was a Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   But not until the sixth inning on Wednesday afternoon did
Glavine get an up-close and personal view of how Jordan takes
having an opposing coach instruct a pitcher to walk the man in
front of him to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan needed just one pitch from the Pirates' Francisco Cordova
to let his feelings be known with a grand slam to left, allowing
Glavine to take his third win of the season as Atlanta beat
Pittsburgh 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two months, Glavine has witnessed some of the
intestinal fortitude of his new teammate who, given the absence of
Andres Galarraga, has responded with a Braves-high 31 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing against him, I always liked the way he played the
game,'' said Glavine, now 3-4. ``But I don't think you get an
appreciation for how good a player he is until you play with him
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan had ripped the same type of pitch, a fastball, from
Cordova in his previous at-bat high into the left-field wind and
watched it die a slow death and fall back into play. But after
back-to-back hits by Ozzie Guillen and Bret Boone, Pirates pitching
coach Pete Vukovich's visit to the mound and the ensuing
intentional walk to Chipper Jones, Jordan took another crack at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always feel a sense of anger when you see that pitching
coach go out there and he's looking at you while he walks out there
and you know he's going to walk Chipper to load the bases to get to
you,'' said Jordan, owner of the Braves' first grand slam of the
year and a team-high 10 home runs. ``I'm just that competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   The four runs gave Atlanta a 5-3 lead on the way to a three-game
sweep of the Pirates. It was the Braves' fourth consecutive win and
first series win after losing the last three series on the road.
Jones and Jordan have combined for 10 RBIs in the last two games
after combining for 11 on the nine-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones credits Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been our MVP so far,'' Jones said.

 &HT;    40-something players still key contributors in the majors
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At age 40, Mickey Mantle had been gone from baseball
for three years. Joe DiMaggio, too. Jim Palmer was in his first
year of retirement. At 40, Sandy Koufax had been retired for nine
seasons. George Foster was through at 37, and so was Dale Murphy.
At 37, Lou Gehrig was dead.
</P>
<P>
   By tradition, the major-leaguer isn't washed up by his 40th
birthday, but he's wearing a pretty good lather. The paradox is
that while baseball is a game of gained experience, the
over-experienced are a burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trouble with baseball,'' Frank Howard once said, ``is by
the time you learn how to play it, you can't play it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Not in 1999. A dozen players age 40 or older are still in the
majors and a 13th, Tim Raines, celebrates his 40th birthday later
in the season. Five years ago, only three 40-year-old players were
active, and one of them, Florida's Charlie Hough, was biding time
until getting a hip replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Expansion, accelerated year-round conditioning programs and a
prevailing economic system have conspired to keep older players in
the game, and not just for decoration. The New York Mets signed up
Rickey Henderson (40) with hopes he would charge the club's
offense. The Atlanta Braves went looking for an affordable leadoff
hitter and found Otis Nixon (40).
</P>
<P>
   The Oakland A's, with six regulars owning two years of
major-league service or less, signed Raines, relief dinosaur Doug
Jones (41), starter Tom Candiotti (41) and outfielder/infielder
Tony Phillips (40) to wet-nurse the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sounds real good, and they've had that impact,'' A's
general manager Billy Beane said. ``But we're limited in our
resources. We get the best players we can with the amount of money
we have. That's probably closer to the truth. We stock both Pampers
and Depends in our clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the geriatrics on the field can be a challenge.
Henderson is on the DL with a sprained knee. Candiotti already has
missed a start because his knee wouldn't loosen up. Tampa Bay's
Wade Boggs, just 57 hits from the 3,000 mark, is on the DL (leg
strain) for the second time in two years. He went his first 16
seasons without ever visiting the DL.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing you've got to find out is how much fight's in the
dog,'' Boggs said. ``And in this one, there's a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but age also plots against them. With his average
against left-handed pitching at .211, Boggs (40) has platooned at
third base with Bobby Smith, delaying No. 3,000 until mid-August.
Left-hander Tony Fossas (41), pitching for his seventh team when
the Yankees called him up earlier this month, also might be out of
work soon, after allowing four runs in his first four outings. Gary
Gaetti (40), is hitting .174 for the Chicago Cubs, which could
prompt his second release within 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   But in general, the statistical return has been high. In
Baltimore, Harold Baines (40) leads the Orioles with 29 RBIs and is
hitting .333 with runners in scoring position. St. Louis' Willie
McGee (40) had been batting .326 before falling to .278, and while
Nixon's average is a dismal .181, he has scored 17 runs in the 33
times he has reached base, a startling 51.5 percent rate. In 1998,
NL runners scored 34 percent of the time they reached base.
</P>
<P>
   Raines and Phillips still pressure opponents from the basepaths.
Phillips was stranded between third and home, with Raines running
behind him, the night Seattle's Carlos Guillen shredded his knee
during the rundown. Since 1997, the season of his drug bust,
Phillips has drifted through five organizations, but he has amazed
the A's with his work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see why he's played as long as he's played,'' said
Oakland manager Art Howe, who was an active player in 1982 when
Phillips first reached the majors. ``He wants to get it right.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Henderson, who is chasing the all-time records for runs
and walks. He needs 216 runs and 145 walks. After a lackluster
spring camp, Henderson has a .427 on-base percentage and has opened
eyes around the Mets clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope I'm still walking when I'm 40 years old,'' Mets
catcher Mike Piazza said. ``If anyone can carry you from a leadoff
spot, he can.''
</P>
<P>
   This 40s set is no anomaly. Until their retirements last winter,
Dennis Eckersley (44), Dennis Martinez (43) and Paul Molitor (42)
filled large roles. Players turning 40 next season include San
Diego's Tony Gwynn, the Yankees' Chili Davis and Texas' Mark
Morgan. Cleveland's Paul Assenmacher, the Mets' John Franco,
Baltimore's Cal Ripken, Anaheim's Charlie O'Brien and Atlanta's
Andres Galarraga are 38. All ensure a robust senior citizenship
into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just too much left on the table, if there is a season
or two of productivity they might have left,'' Braves general
manager John Schuerholz said. ``They wouldn't just be leaving the
chance to add to the back of their bubble-gum card. Now there's the
chance to fatten their portfolio.

 &HT;    Crawford has strong case for seeking to start
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Has Chris Crawford won back his spot in the starting
lineup?
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll talk it over and make a decision then,'' Hawks coach
Lenny Wilkens said after Wednesday's practice.
</P>
<P>
   Bet Crawford will start and for a number of reasons:
</P>
<P>
   _ He practiced with the other four starters, a definite giveaway
under the Wilkens' system.
</P>
<P>
   _ He was playing very well before his shoulder injury in Game 2
against Detroit and had a career-high 26 points off the bench
Tuesday against the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Hawks are much more flexible when Ty Corbin, who scored
only two points Tuesday as a starter, comes out of the lineup.
Playing off the bench, Corbin gives Wilkens the option of spotting
him at big guard or small forward.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Crawford has to be up to the assignment physically
and he says he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little sore,'' he said after his first game in a week.
``That's to be expected. But I'm not limited in my arm movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford, briefly a minor league pitcher in the Astros
organization, was asked if going 7-for-14 from the field and
9-for-11 from the foul line left him with the same degree of
soreness as, say, a nine-inning shutout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put it this way,'' he said Wednesday, ``I couldn't pitch
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Car-pooling
</P>
<P>
   Dikembe Mutombo gave his friend and rival center Patrick Ewing a
ride back to the Knicks' team hotel after Tuesday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Did they talk shop?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Mutombo said. ``In fact, Patrick hardly talked to me at
all. He was too busy talking to my little girl (Carrie, 2).''
</P>
<P>
   In the game, Ewing lost his temper after hacking Mutombo in the
head late in the third quarter and was hit with a technical foul by
referee Ted Bernhardt. Asked if he were surprised by Ewing's
reaction to an obvious infraction, Mutombo said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrick was frustrated. You're in a playoff game and you want
to be part of it, but he was in foul trouble early so he didn't
play much minutes ((17). That's what it was, his frustration.''
</P>
<P>
   Transplants
</P>
<P>
   Grant Long said he was not upset by the strong support the
Knicks received Tuesday. ``The Knicks are sort of like the Dallas
Cowboys and the Cowboys are America's team,'' Long said. ``It's the
same way with the Braves because of cable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere you go, there are New York fans. They're
transplanted here; they're transplanted everywhere. It's not
anything against our team. There are New York fans all across the
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   A new view on Henderson
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Marmer, eye surgeon and team physician, now says that
surgery is not indicated for forward Alan Henderson's damaged left
eye. Henderson is scheduled to fly to Baltimore today for a second
opinion. However favorable the report, he is not expected to play
again this season.

 &HT;    Hawks' repairs start with defense
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Hawks are in trouble. They know it. Their fans
know it. Unless the Knicks wear blinders, they know they have their
second-round playoff opponent on the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's Game 2 at the Georgia Dome is one Atlanta needs to
win, and not because teams almost never come back from a 2-0
deficit in a seven-game series. It happens, but teams with thin
rosters like the Hawks don't exhibit terrible defensive play twice
at home and recover.
</P>
<P>
   Dikembe Mutombo said he could not remember the last time the
Hawks gave up 100 points. ``I don't know if we give up that many
points all season. That's how different this game was for us.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, going into the playoffs, the Hawks had not surrendered
100 points in their last 23 regular-season games. They allowed 100
points or more three times during the regular season and won all
three.
</P>
<P>
   After his team allowed 50.6 percent shooting, coach Lenny
Wilkens said bad offense can lead to bad defense and the Hawks were
guilty on both counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you've got to get better coverage. You bang _ whatever
you have to do. We yielded not that many turnovers, nine, but we
gave up 15 points from those turnovers, and that's because we
didn't get back on defense. And bad shot selection had something to
with that.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a lot to wonder about, a lot to fix before the Hawks
go back on the court.
</P>
<P>
   Why were the Hawks, in a playoff game, settling for the
one-pass-and-shoot scenario?
</P>
<P>
   Why was Grant Long, who went scoreless, so ineffective two
nights after leading his team past the Pistons with 26 points and
11 rebounds?
</P>
<P>
   Why did the coach wait four painful possessions into the third
quarter to call timeout when it was clear after two that the Knicks
had made an adjustment and the Hawks were out of kilter? They
eventually went from eight points ahead to eight behind.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, where was Chris Crawford when things were falling
apart? After scoring 20 first-half points, he did not come back to
the game until 4:47 of the third quarter, with the Knicks up 66-62.
And then, the Hawks did not run a post-up play for Crawford,
although he dominated Latrell Sprewell in the second quarter with
17 points.
</P>
<P>
   With 2,232 regular-season and playoff games under his belt,
Wilkens rarely feels compelled to explain himself.
</P>
<P>
   He said he held Crawford in reserve so the young forward could
make an impact on the game when he was needed. He said he took a
timeout at 6:38 of the third quarter and another at 5:08 because
that's when circumstances dictated that he call them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Crawford aside, not much the Hawks did was right against a
Knicks team that is playing at a much higher level since the roles
of Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston were intertwined late in the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Long noted that the playoffs have a way of melding diverse
personalities. ``You heard there aren't enough balls to go around
with Patrick (Ewing) and Sprewell, not enough minutes for Houston
and Sprewell. (But) they put it all together. In the playoffs, guys
come together for a common goal.''
</P>
<P>
   So what can Long do about it after shooting 0-for-6?
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I've got to be more aggressive,'' he said. ``I
never got any great looks in the game, never any free looks. There
was always somebody in my face and you can't really get a rhythm
until you get some easy shots, maybe a shot where there's no one in
front of you.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all need to step up. And if you've watched our team, you
know we can do that.''

 &HT;    Love or hate him, Sprewell excelling
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Fairly or not, Latrell Sprewell's legacy was carved
out in the neck of P.J. Carlesimo about 17 months ago. He became
and will be forever more ``the player who choked his coach,'' a
symbol of violence and mayhem. But Sprewell wears it well.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was best for him to end up in New York with the
Knicks after the incident with his old Golden State Warriors coach,
for there the scrutiny is more prying than anywhere, if by the
sheer number of media people alone. And if Sprewell was going to
show his true self _ as a player and person _ why not do it where
it'll be documented to the utmost?
</P>
<P>
   What the examination has uncovered since joining the Knicks is
this: Sprewell's an amazing athlete who has the mental capacity to
withstand the vehement expressions of dislike around the league by
fans. The boos follow him in NBA arenas around the league, but he
obviously thrives in the situation rather than succumbing to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows the type of person he is,'' Knicks reserve guard
Chris Childs said. ``He's seizing the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell scored 16.4 points off the bench this season for the
Knicks and is a reason the Knicks go into tonight's Game 2 of the
semifinals series with the Hawks ahead 1-0. His 31-point blistering
of Atlanta in Game 1 Tuesday might have been the effort that
solidifies his re-emergence as an All-Star guard.
</P>
<P>
   The performance was calculating, yet random, his creativity with
the ball and speed dominant.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, when he arrived in New York, Sprewell carried more
baggage perhaps than any player ever. Baggage so heavy there were
no guarantees he could reclaim his position among the NBA's elite
guards _ or that he could actually be an asset to a team with lofty
ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, it's very hard to be immediately good after such
a long layoff,'' coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``Secondly, you never
know about a player coming from a losing situation because they
develop bad habits. But he's there. I mean, he didn't play for a
year (suspension), had a major injury (heel), was with a new team
and all the scrutiny. It was so much more. I'm shocked he's this
good after being out that long. It's tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of his development has been recognizing when to express his
talent, which was a real adjustment coming from the Warriors and
with the desire to prove he can still do it. ``Not every possession
(on a bad team) is as important as with a winning team,'' Van Gundy
explained. ``(Sprewell will) think: `Maybe I'll take this shot
here' when you're down 15 points. Derek Harper _ and he was one of
the best we ever had in New York _ had the same problem coming from
Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Sprewell's scoring, explosiveness and aggression is
appreciated to an almost cult degree. He is the crowd favorite at
Madison Square Garden, which speaks for his performance more than
New Yorkers' kind nature. For sure, if Sprewell did not flourish,
he'd be booed there, too.
</P>
<P>
   But he has somehow turned those who hissed at the trade that
brought him there into his raunchiest supporters. That he has done
it after not playing NBA ball for more than a year makes his play
that much more remarkable. For point guard Charlie Ward _ the
Knicks' resident spirituality rock _ Sprewell's handling of the
scrutiny and his mostly stellar play on the court is about growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's grown from that whole experience at Golden State,'' Ward
said. ``A lot of people wouldn't be able to handle what he's gone
through. He's done a good job of being himself, of remaining
strong. It takes a mature person to learn from errors. He's taking
this opportunity to prove people wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good brother.''

 &HT;    Manchester, Bayern revived
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The last time anyone from Manchester United was seen
hoisting the European Cup, it was Bobby Charlton 31 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bayern Munich won three titles in a row culminating in 1976, but
then Franz Beckenbauer headed for America and the New York Cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   The respective dry spells for two of Europe's most legendary
teams have lasted so long that they have magnified the hype leading
up to Wednesday's championship match.
</P>
<P>
   The first Champions' League final not to include a defending
champion unfolds at massive Nou Camp Stadium in Barcelona (2:30
p.m., ESPN2), with both teams also trying to win triple crowns _
European, league and domestic cup titles.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, United captured the first leg by downing Tottenham
Hotspur in a 2-1 comeback for its fifth English Premier League
title in seven years. But before heading to Spain, United will stop
off at Wembley Stadium on Saturday to meet Newcastle in the FA Cup
final.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-day schedule is a grueling one for United, which will be
missing suspended captain Roy Keane and center forward Paul Scholes
and possibly injured defender Jaap Stam for Bayern Munich. But
counting United out has been premature, as shown by its rally to
beat Juventus in the semifinals and by a scintillating FA Cup
semifinal overtime win against Arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``My players proved that they have something that elevates them
beyond the rest,'' United manager Alex Ferguson said Sunday. ``This
club is not about egos, not about chasing records. It's about
maintaining success.''
</P>
<P>
   For all its dominance in England under Ferguson, United has been
haunted by the ghosts of 1968, when Charlton and George Best gave
coach Sir Matt Busby his only taste of European glory.
</P>
<P>
   Bayern Munich cruised to the Bundesliga title and will have time
to rest up before its June 12 German Cup final against Werder
Bremen. Striker Giovanne Elber, one of the top guns in Europe, will
be out, and French World Cup defender Bixente Lizarazu is trying to
come back from injury. The key to the German club's success has
been to shed some of the glamour, and a lot of the infighting, that
earned it the moniker ``FC Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There has not been one quarrel on this team,'' said
38-year-old libero Lothar Matthaus, who was with Bayern Munich when
it last reached the European Cup final, in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Italy: Crabby Cragnotti
</P>
<P>
   Two days after his team lost its hold on the Serie A lead, Lazio
chairman Sergio Cragnotti was complaining of poor officiating in a
1-1 draw with Fiorentina. But is the tomato-sauce tycoon more upset
that his club might be missing out on its first scudetto in 25
years or the fact that its value on the Milan stock exchange
dropped by $22 million (6 percent) on Monday as a result?
</P>
<P>
   Cragnotti said the referee should have given a penalty kick to
Lazio's Marcelo Salas on Saturday. At the same time, a hat trick by
Oliver Bierhoff paced AC Milan to a 4-0 rout of Empoli and a
one-point lead over Lazio heading into the final weekend of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always hope people are acting in good faith,'' Cragnotti
said in an interview Tuesday with Gazzetto dello Sport. ``But there
are strange things happening, and I wouldn't want the usual mess-up
to happen this Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Ronaldo was denied a penalty kick in a game down the
stretch as Inter Milan lost the title to Juventus. Naturally, Milan
boss Adriano Galliani lashed out at Cragnotti. ``I didn't know that
clubs that are listed on the stock exchange are entitled to
different treatment from the others,'' Galliani said.
</P>
<P>

   The remainder of the Yugoslavian first-division season,
interrupted since March 24 because of NATO bombings, has been
called off. The federation will decide later this month how to
determine a winner and runner-up to send to the European Champions'
League next year. Partizan Belgrade had been leading with 66
points, two more than defending champion Obilic. Last week, UEFA
ruled that Yugoslavia's national team would not be allowed to play
home matches during Euro 2000 qualifying. A June 8 match against
Malta originally scheduled for Belgrade has been moved to Greece.

   Women: USA meets Brazil
</P>
<P>
   Mia Hamm is poised to make soccer history Saturday in what
should be a good test for the U.S. women, who meet Brazil in a
friendly in Orlando (7:30 p.m., ESPN2). Hamm needs one goal to
become the all-time international scorer after tying Italy's
Elisabetta Vignotto at 107 on Sunday against Holland. Brazil is a
potential Women's World Cup semifinal opponent for the U.S., which
completed its roster Monday with few surprises. In addition to
Hamm, 12 other veterans of the 1996 Olympic champion team are
included.

SETTLEMENT IS REPORTEDLY NEAR IN VITAMIN PRICE-FIXING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Eds: Inserts new 9th graf, The possibility ..., to credit The Wall
Street Journal; adds new last graf; changes yesterday to Wednesday
throughout.) (rm)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Justice Department is expected to announce shortly that at
least two of the world's largest drug and chemical companies have
agreed to pay as much as $700 million to settle criminal charges
that they participated in a global conspiracy to fix prices in the
sale of vitamins, according to people close to the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   In what would be the largest settlement ever in a federal
anti-trust case, Roche Holding A.G. of Switzerland and BASF A.G. of
Germany are expected to plead guilty to charges that they were part
of a global conspiracy to set prices and divide up the world market
in animal and human vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   While the negotiations with the government could break down,
people close to the negotiations said that the case is expected to
be resolved as early as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Roche Holdings is expected to pay as much as $500 million to
settle the case and BASF is expected to pay about $200 million,
according to people who have been briefed on the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Rhone-Poulenc of France has been under investigation but is not
expected to be fined, partly because executives there are
cooperating with federal investigators, people close to the
negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman at the Justice Department refused to comment
Wednesday on the prospect of an upcoming settlement. And
spokespersons for the three companies would only say that they are
cooperating with federal investigators and seeking to resolve the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We refuse to confirm or deny any speculation regarding a
settlement,'' said John Gilardi, a spokesman at BASF in Germany.
``We are cooperating with the Justice Department investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Roche and Rhone-Poulenc issued similar statements.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of settlements in the case was first reported in
The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury in Dallas has been probing price-fixing
allegations in the vitamin market for more than a year and criminal
indictments are expected to be handed up as soon as Thursday,
according to people close to the settlement. Several executives
could also be charged.
</P>
<P>
   A number of class-action lawsuits have also been filed against
the European companies, alleging that over the past decade,
executives at the three largest vitamin manufacturers _ Roche, BASF
and Rhone-Poulenc _ and several smaller manufacturers and vitamin
blenders, met secretly and agreed to fix prices and carve up
territories in the United States and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Silver, an attorney at Boies &AMP; Schiller in Armonk, N.Y.,
said his firm filed one of the earliest class-action suits in 1998,
and then filed several more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lawsuits have alleged illegal conduct by an international
cartel that deliberately targeted and severely burdened consumers
in the United States,'' he said in an interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not a settlement takes place, federal prosecutors and
a number of class-action lawsuits have charged a massive global
conspiracy that involved fixing prices of the sale of such common
vitamins as vitamin A, C and E, as well as niacin and other B
complex vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   The cases involve everyday vitamins that are sold in
supermarkets and drugstores as well as the bulk sale of vitamins
that are fed to animals to produce a leaner and more healthy stock.
</P>
<P>
   The federal investigation into collusion in the vitamin market
is considered one of the most important anti-trust cases under
review by the Justice Department. Just months ago, Joel I. Klein,
the assistant attorney general in charge of the anti-trust
division, said: ``Our investigation into worldwide conspiracies
involving vitamins is continuing. Those conspiracies have affected
billions of dollars of commerce in products found in nearly every
American household.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last March, Lonza AG, a Swiss vitamin manufacturer, and five
executives at other companies pleaded guilty to price-fixing in the
vitamin market and agreed to cooperate with the Justice Department
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Lonza, a much smaller player that specializes in B-complex
vitamins, agreed to pay $10.5 million to settle price-fixing
charges brought by the anti-trust division of the Justice
Department. In that case, the government alleged that between 1992
and 1998, Lonza officials met and exchanged sales and customer
information and colluded to set prices for vitamins in the
B-complex group.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, executives at Chinook Group, a Canadian
company and DuCoa, a company formed as a joint venture between
Dupont and Conagra, pleaded guilty to charges that they conspired
to fix the prices of animal and human vitamins and divided up
markets in the U.S. and elsewhere. Those executives could be hit
with fines of at least $350,000 and a maximum of three years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Departments crackdown on the international
conspiracy involving vitamins is part of a larger sweep that
involves collusion among a number of huge global companies.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, Hoechst AG, the German drug maker, pleaded guilty to
conspiring to fix prices in the food preservatives market. The
company agreed to pay a fine of $36 million. And in that same
month, the Justice Department settled the largest anti-trust action
in U.S. history when SGL Carbon of Germany agreed to pay $145
million to settle charges that it fixed prices in the sale of
graphite electrodes, which are used in the manufacturing of steel.
</P>
<P>
   American companies have not been immune from the price-fixing
scandals. Archer Daniels Midland agreed in 1996 to pay $100 million
to settle charges that it fixed prices of lysine, a feed additive,
and citric acid, an organic acid used in various foods and
beverages.

TEXAS PARENTAL NOTIFICATION BILL OFF LINE FOR NOW 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ An emotionally charged parental notification
bill for minors seeking abortions skidded off track Wednesday in
the Texas House but is expected to be back up for consideration by
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's fate still hangs in the balance, but backers insisted
it remains alive, even after enduring the infamous use of a
parliamentary procedure on House rules that killed a similar
measure last session.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping for the best, expecting the worst maybe,'' said
Rep. Dianne Delisi, R-Temple, the House sponsor of Senate Bill 30.
When the bill returns to the House, it will be the third time that
body has been set to vote on the controversial issue.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic turn of events began after a proposal by Rep.
Patricia Gray, D-Galveston, to allow adult family members _
grandparents, aunts, uncles and adult siblings _ to be notified
instead of parents was shot down by a 77-68 vote. Opponents are
adamant that only a judge should be allowed to decide if there is
good reason n &UR; A

   CASTAIC, Calif. _ Call me a sucker for kids with fishing poles,
but there is something entirely magical about those beaming faces
when a flip-flopping trout is brought in at line's end.

   &UR; Christie Brinkley  &LR; is going to the Balkans, &LR;  to visit Sarajevo
with the USO-Department of Defense Operation Allied Force tour,
featuring Ford supermodels. Brinkley's agent said she'd be

   Gere was one of the first to make the trip. ``We learned a lot
from Gere's visit,'' a Macedonian representative to UNICEF told the
Ottawa Times. ``The problem is the focus can end up on the
celebrity and the stir they cause rather than the problems of the
children.''

refused to be driven around and stayed at a simple hotel. Still,

 &HT;    Point of order takes life out of parental notification bill
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For the second session in a row, a House
lawmaker wielding a legislative technicality may kill a bill that
would force doctors to contact the parents of an underage girl
seeking an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Harold Dutton (D-Houston) on Wednesday employed a maneuver
called a ``point of order'' to pull a parental notification bill
from the House floor, endangering a highly popular GOP measure with
less than 11 days before the end of the session.
</P>
<P>
   Dutton argued that the minutes from one of the State Affairs
Committee's hearings on Senate Bill 30 were inaccurate, a
contention House Speaker Pete Laney upheld.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, committee members scrambled into a room just off
the House chamber to approve the bill again. Soon after, lawmakers
scheduled it for another floor debate Friday. The quick turnaround
highlighted the precarious position the bill is now in: House rules
mandate that it must by approved by that body by Tuesday, so any
delay _ or another point of order _ could bury it for the session.
``There is still life in it, but there is no additional room for
error,'' said Rep. Sylvester Turner (D-Houston). ``In this
legislative process, it is much easier to kill than to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Dutton said he'll try to raise another point of order before he
allows the House to vote on the parental notification bill he
derailed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you have to kill things around her twice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dutton's maneuver could jeopardize a measure that Gov. George W.
Bush hoped to point to as one of his legislative accomplishments
when he hits the presidential campaign trail next month. Bush, who
is anti-abortion rights, has already drawn fire from religious
conservatives for being less than strident on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-abortion rights activists railed against Dutton's action as
a perversion of the political process. Last session, Rep. Debra
Danburg (D-Houston) used a technical objection to kill a similar
parental notification bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am frustrated beyond belief,'' said Bill Price of Texas
Right-To-Life. ``This is what causes people to drop out of the
political system. This is cynicism at its worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Price said Bush was involved in efforts to forge a compromise
bill in the last several weeks, but that he was ``disappointed with
the effort up to that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Most members of the Texas House support parental notification.
But they disagree on the alternatives that should be available to
girls who don't want to tell their parents. One option, asking a
judge to waive the parental notification requirement, must be
included to make the measure constitutional. That safeguard is
designed mostly to protect girls who are being sexually abused at
home.
</P>
<P>
   But some lawmakers argue that many girls would rather endanger
themselves by getting an abortion from someone other than a doctor
than tell their parents or face a judge. Rep. Patricia Gray
(D-Galveston) offered an amendment to the bill which would have
allowed a girl to notify a grandparent, an adult sibling or an
adult aunt or uncle rather than a parent. The House rejected the
amendment on a 77-68 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Dutton said he had agreed not raise the technical objection
unless the Gray amendment failed. Once it did, he let fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They live in a world where there are two parents at home _
kind of the old Ozzie and Harriet sort of thing,'' Dutton said of
those who oppose Gray's amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you live in a city where the little girl tells me her
mother died last year of AIDS, her father is in prison, now she's
being raised by her grandmother and there's never been any formal
proceedings to create a guardianship, what are we supposed to do
about that situation?''
</P>
<P>
   During floor debate on her amendment, Gray argued that it would
reduce the number of abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be party to a child having an abortion because
she feels she has no other option,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the amendment said a parent _ not an uncle in a
faraway city, an elderly grandparent or a 19-year-old sister who
just started college _ is the only one equipped to guide a girl
through a traumatic procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing with this is saying that a third party can
step in between a parent and their child without first having made
any showing whatsoever that there is something wrong with the
relationship between the parent and the child,'' said Rep. Phil
King (R-Weatherford).
</P>
<P>
   Though they were enraged by Dutton's maneuver, anti-abortion
activists expressed confidence that the House eventually will
approve it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will come back, we will get this bill through. It will go
to the governor's desk,'' said Chuck Anderson of the Texas
Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson pointed out that 39 states have notification or consent
laws and that four-fifths of Texans want a parental notification
law, according to a recent Texas Poll. The poll did not ask about
alternatives to notifying parents.
</P>
<P>
   Kae McLaughlin of the Texas Abortion and Reproductive Rights
Action League described Dutton's maneuver and the two-day delay as
``nothing for me to get excited about.'' She said it would,
however, give her time to convince more lawmakers to vote for
Gray's amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think our kids are safe _ we're not jumping up and
down,'' McLaughlin said.

LEVITZ TOUTS EXPANSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: Today in 1st, 12th grafs refers Thursday.) 
BY JASON TAKENOUCHI 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARITA, Calif. _ Levitz Furniture Corp. will kick off
what officials call a re-birth of the company today with the grand
opening of a Santa Clarita Valley store, the first expansion since
the company filed for bankruptcy in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The newest store sports an open layout and a new merchandise
mix. Both are meant to reposition the company, which analysts say
suffered because its furniture failed to keep up with customers'
tastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is a milestone,'' said Ed Grund, chairman and chief
executive officer of the Boca Raton, Fla.-based company. ``We think
this signals to the consumers, the vendors and ourselves that we
have the capability and wherewithal to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   The company chose a good time to expand.
</P>
<P>
   The furniture industry had record sales of $57.8 billion in
1998, said Jerry Epperson, an analyst with Wachovia Securities.
Sales this year are expected to increase slightly over that - &QC; evel,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new store _ the 64th in the Levitz chain _ has been open in
the Valencia Marketplace since April 10 and has already generated
significant interest, said sales manager Anthony Tapia.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past 10 days we've sold $100,000 with no promotion at
all,'' he said. ``It's a very good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   The store's target is $400,000 to $500,000 in sales every month,
but Tapia said he is hoping for an average of $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   The success or failure of the roughly 20,000-square-foot Santa
Clarita store is especially important for Levitz. The company is
still in the midst of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, and
it announced the closing of 27 stores late last year.
</P>
<P>
   The opening is part of a broader effort to grow the company
where housing markets are growing, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very bullish about Valencia,'' Grund said. ``We would
have actually preferred a larger store but it wasn't available and
we wanted to be here now.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's ceremony coincides with the official re-opening of the
company's Huntington Beach and Redondo Beach stores.
</P>
<P>
   The remodels are part of the company's effort to revitalize the
lagging chain by closing stores in weaker markets, revamping
merchandise mixes and changing the company's image.
</P>
<P>
   The first Levitz store opened in 1910.

   &UR; Christie Brinkley  &LR; is going to the Balkans, &LR;  to visit Sarajevo
with the USO-Department of Defense Operation Allied Force tour,
featuring Ford supermodels. Brinkley's agent said she'd be
``visiting the military bases, signing autographs, getting
handshakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Brinkley thus joins the ranks of celebrities, including
 &UR; Richard Gere &LR; ,  &UR; Vanessa Redgrave &LR; ,  &UR; Bianca Jagger &LR; , &UR; Roger Moore &LR; 
and  &UR; Joyce Maynard &LR; , who's been getting her name in the paper
elsewhere for selling the love letters of  &UR; J.D. Salinger &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Gere was one of the first to make the trip. ``We learned a lot
from Gere's visit,'' a Macedonian representative to UNICEF told the
Ottawa Times. ``The problem is the focus can end up on the
celebrity and the stir they cause rather than the problems of the
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore who came bearing toys that caused near-riotous excitement,
refused to be driven around and stayed at a simple hotel. Still,
said UNICEF worker  &UR; Enver Mehmeti &LR; , his visit didn't really help.

James Bond such a long time ago.''

STICKING TO ISSUES PAYS OFF FOR PHILADELPHIA MAYORAL PRIMARY
WINNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ In winning the Democratic primary on Tuesday to
succeed Edward G. Rendell as mayor of Philadelphia, John F. Street
held tightly to his issue-oriented message in the face of personal
attacks that nearly defeated him.
</P>
<P>
   While other candidates in the crowded field used attack
advertising in their campaigns, Street tried to ignore the barrage
and managed to win by a slim margin over his most aggressive
opponent in the race, Marty Weinberg.
</P>
<P>
   Street, 55, who resigned as city council president to run for
mayor, captured 100,902 votes, 35.5 percent of the total, to 89,041
votes, or 31.3 percent, for Weinberg, an aide to former Mayor Frank
Rizzo who was making his first run for elective office.
</P>
<P>
   John White Jr., a former head of the city housing agency and the
state welfare department, finished third with 61,816 votes for 21.7
percent. Happy Fernandez, a former city council member and the
first woman to run a credible race for mayor of Philadelphia, won
17,952 votes, 6.3 percent. Dwight Evans, a state legislator, had
13,290, 2.7 percent, and Queena R. Bass.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer then 30 percent of the city's 980,000 registered voters
turned out, about the average level of participation for a
primaries in Philadelphia, a city of 1.47 million people, about 40
percent black.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am enormously pleased about the way I conducted my
campaign,'' Street said Wednesday at a victory lunch with Rendell
and other city leaders. ``But as the winning candidate, I now have
to do what I can to bring the party together, not just for me but
for the city of Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Street's success on Tuesday flowed from his smooth
working relationship with Rendell, a popular Democrat who is barred
from seeking a third consecutive four-year term. Over the years,
they worked closely together, drawing back Philadelphia from a
fiscal abyss in the early 1990s with programs of economic austerity
that led to budget surpluses and urban renewal throughout many
parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
   It came as no surprise that Rendell gave Street, one of four
black candidates in the primary, a hardy endorsement. But in the
November general election, Street will face a Republican opponent
who also played a major role in the city's turnaround, Sam Katz,
who ran unopposed on Tuesday. As an expert in municipal finance,
Katz, 49, was one of the first consultants Rendell sought out to
stabilize the city's finances.
</P>
<P>
   Katz ran unsuccessfully for mayor in 1991 and for governor of
Pennsylvania in 1994, and in a city where registered Democrats
outnumber Republicans by almost 4-to-1, it might appear that he has
a difficult task ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But aides said his campaign strategy for the general election
will be to attract Republicans and the considerable number of
Democrats who did not vote for Street in the primary, including
many black voters.
</P>
<P>
   It is a calculation that strategists for Katz helped bring about
through the unusual decision to inject him into the Democratic
advertising wars. Katz ran commercials that attacked the two
Democrats he least wanted to face in the fall, Weinberg and White.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the aides said, Katz preferred a showdown with
Street, whose political fervor through years as a black community
leader most sharply contrasted with his own.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster Street's chances in the primary, Katz ran
advertisements that questioned Weinberg's and White's credibility
and management skills.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Katz said in an interview, Street's close
relationship with Rendell provides him an opening to portray Street
as a status quo candidate who is resistant to bolder solutions to
the city's most intractable problems.
</P>
<P>
   As examples, Katz said, he favors school vouchers to offer
children alternatives to troubled public schools and a faster
reduction of the city wage tax as a means to stimulate economic
development. Street opposes vouchers and favors a slower reduction
of the wage tax.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to make his case that more drastic measures are necessary,
Katz pointed out that for all the progress in the Rendell-Street
years, the city has lost 150,000 residents and 40,000 jobs since
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg, meanwhile, focused most of his attacks on Street, the
campaign front-runner who won glowing endorsements from the city's
three leading newspapers _ The Inquirer, The Daily News, and The
Tribune, the last of which has a mostly black readership.
</P>
<P>
   Playing largely to the same middle-class and working-class white
voters who supported Rizzo, Weinberg used television commercials
that showed 18-year-old images of Street shoving a reporter and
throwing water in the face of a city council staff member,
Weinberg's way of suggesting to voters that Street might be too
unstable to lead the city government.
</P>
<P>
   Other Weinberg advertisements cited financial problems Street
once had, including the two times he sought personal bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Street did not respond in his commercials until
late in the campaign and then only to admonish Weinberg for
attacking him and injecting an element of race in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Street focused on issues like seeking more state
revenues to improve public schools and expanding economic
development as a way to aid some of Philadelphia's neighborhoods,
where residents are suffering from substandard housing, joblessness
and high crime rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of working together, Philadelphia has become a can-do
city, and it's important for us to continue that work,'' said
Street, who would become the city's second black mayor, after W.
Wilson Goode, who preceded Rendell. ``The first step is to make
sure we heal the wounds of the primary. I'm sure all the candidates
will do their fair share to bring the party and the city back
together.''

LEGISLATORS SEEKS TO BOOST BUSH'S ENVIRONMENTAL RECORD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ From improving Texas air quality to debating
whether to turn West Texas into a national dump for low-level
radioactive waste, the Legislature on Thursday is setting the stage
to establish Gov. George W. Bush's environmental record for the
2000 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bush) may not be able to win as an environmentalist, but he
certainly could lose if he can't show the soccer moms that their
kids are going to have clean air,'' said Tom Smith, state director
of 8`Y envi.K++W,[H95R4onsumer group Public Citizen.
</P>
<P>
   While the House debates two Bush-backed bills Thursday dealing
with the clean-up of grandfathered industrial plants built before
the passage of the 1971 federal Clean Air Act, the Texas Senate is
poised to debate a bill that would allow private companies to run
nuclear waste dumps in West Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who may face environmentally oriented Democrat Al Gore in
the 2000 general election campaign, expressed concern Wednesday
about the nuclear waste bill.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he has always backed a compact with Maine and Vermont
because it limited how much nuclear waste Texas would take, but the
bill pending before the Senate would allow private operators to
accept federal Department of Energy waste from across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not want Texas to become the dumping ground for nuclear
waste,'' Bush said. ``I am concerned that our regulatory agencies
won't be able to control the amount of waste coming into our
state.''
</P>
<P>
   But the legislation also creates discomfort for Bush because one
of the companies pushing the bill, Pasadena-based Waste Control
Specialists, is owned by some of Bush's top campaign contributors.
Bush said he has not talked to his backers about the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The company's majority owner, Dallas investor Harold Simmons,
gave $35,000 to Bush's re-election campaign last year. Simmons also
is a major donor to the national Republican Party committees,
giving $465,000 during the 1996 and 1998 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Another Waste Control owner is Kent Hance, a Bush friend who
donated $31,000 to the governor's re-election. And one of Simmons'
Dallas consultants, state Public Safety Chairman Jim Francis, is a
Bush friend and his 1994 campaign finance chairman.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush faced pressure last year on whether a state-run
low-level nuclear waste site should be located at Sierra Blanca,
Bush avoided the issue by saying the decision was up to his Texas
Natural Resources and Conservation Commission members. The TNRCC
killed the Sierra Blanca site.
</P>
<P>
   But if the nuclear waste privatization bill passes the
Legislature, the buck will stop on Bush's desk.
</P>
<P>
   Bush declined to say Wednesday whether he would veto any nuclear
waste bill that allows DOE waste to be imported into Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Another company, Envirocare of Texas, wants a subcontract with
the Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste Authority to run the compact
site which would have been located at Sierra Blanca.
</P>
<P>
   One of Bush's national political allies, former South Carolina
Gov. David Beasley was among Republicans in South Carolina,
California and North Carolina who lost statewide elections last
year largely because of their stands on environmental issues.
Beasley's opponent said he had turned South Carolina into a
``nuclear pay toilet'' by supporting a commercial radioactive waste
facility.
</P>
<P>
   Two bills before the House will spotlight Bush's role in
cleaning up grandfathered industrial plants.
</P>
<P>
   Bush supports one bill that allows the owners of such plants to
come into voluntary compliance with the Clean Air Act if they join
a state compliance program by 2001. He also supports an electric
deregulation bill that will require power companies to bring their
power plants into compliance with the Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have protested the voluntary compliance bill
this legislative session, demanding that the compliance be required
and saying the bill is Bush's sop to industries that have put more
than $300,000 into his presidential campaign so far. Several
environmentalists have been arrested at the Texas Governor's
Mansion while protesting the Bush measure.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush has contended that he is the first governor even to try
to bring the grandfathered plants into compliance. He said
Wednesday that the clean-air provisions in the electric
deregulation bill will substantially improve Texas air quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am for clean air in the state of Texas,'' Bush said. ``The
electric dereg bill, which will substantially reduce air emissions
in the state of Texas, is a very good piece of public legislation
and I intend to sign it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said clean air will define his administration's
environmental legacy in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to ask the question, is the air cleaner since I
became governor, and the answer is yes,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Texas has been fighting with the federal Environmental
Protection Agency since Bush has been governor over air quality in
the Dallas-Fort Worth area. And a recent report by the TNRCC
indicated that air quality in the Houston Gulf Coast area has
actually declined since Bush has been governor.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore has made environmental reform one of the
hallmarks of his government service this decade. Bush declined
Wednesday to discuss Gore, who faces a challenge for his party's
presidential nomination from former U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley of New
Jersey. But the governor said he does believe the environment will
be an important issue in the 2000 contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The environment) should be an issue,'' Bush said. ``The
environment is incredibly important for America in the 21st
century.''
</P>
<P>
   While there have been no specific legislative issues involving
global warming this year, Bush's position on whether global warming
exists has been changing almost as fast as the Texas weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``The science is still out on issues like global warming. We
need to gather enough data that if there are any public policy
decisions, we base them on science,'' Bush said March 11.
</P>
<P>
   But last week Bush said global warming exists: ``The last time I
wasn't certain of the science. I've had some briefings recently,
and I'm becoming convinced that the science proves there's global
warming.''

<P>
   LAKE WORTH, Texas _ Lake Worth's frantic, frenzied effort to
find frogs is finally finished.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen frogs are scheduled to be flown in Thursday from
Rochester, N.Y., saving Lake Worth's 16th Annual Bullfrog
Festival's signature event, a frog race at 2 p.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week, I really thought we would have to cancel the
races,'' said Judy Haas, executive director of the Northwest
Tarrant Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Haas and other volunteers canvassed Texas, Louisiana and other
nearby states for a bullfrog source for the frog festival in Lake
Worth, a Fort Worth suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Haas' daughter, Michelle Werthen, even made a leap at some
bullfrogs on the 16th hole of2the Rolling Hills Country Club golf
course in nearby Arlington, Texas. After a 2 1/2-hour expedition,
Werthen, 33, was left with mud-caked pants, little dignity and one
``bad-eyed'' frog.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber is paying $125 to Ward's Natural Science
Establishment in Rochester for the frogs. Bob Iveson, Ward's
biology production manager, isn't surprised about Lake Worth's frog
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The bullfrog population isn't declining, but there is a global
amphibian crisis as developments take over the ponds and puddles
that frogs favor, Iveson said. Ward's frogs come from Louisiana, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a pond becomes a parking lot, the habitat is gone
forever,'' Iveson said.
</P>
<P>
   Ward's mostly supplies frogs to schools for science classes, but
it also handles unusual requests and ships all over the world, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We guarantee live delivery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After a newspaper article last week about Lake Worth's frog
search, Haas said, she received several leads. Dan Burt, an
Arlington golfer, informed Haas about the frogs he encounters on
the Rglming Hills course.
</P>
<P>
   Burt gigged frogs while growing up and reckoned that his East
Texas know-how gave him the edge on any citified frog living on a
golf course. Gigging is usually a nighttime operation, but Burt
said the golf course frogs seemed so laid back that he figured a
daylight hunt would be sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, he underestimated the jumpy critters.
</P>
<P>
   Burt joined Werthen and her husband, Cory, at the 16th hole
about 8 a.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Werthen, who said she waded knee-deep into the pond, described
her adventure: ``The frogs just looked at me and smiled as if to
say, `Catch me if you can.' Every time I'd get close, they'd jump
back in the water. I managed to sneak up on one and caught him.''
</P>
<P>
   That lone frog had impaired vision, Werthen said. Nonetheless,
she took it home, but the frog escaped from her apartment patio and
is on the lam somewhere in Hurst.
</P>
<P>
   Werthen has been recruited to take care of the irreplaceable new
frogs, and she promises to keep a closer eye on them.
</P>
<P>
   The six bullfrogs will be packed in plastic bags with water and
extra oxygen and cushioned in moss before they are put into boxes.
Werthen will store them on her patio in a prefabricated fish pond
with netting securely clamped across the top. She has gathered some
crickets for the frogs.
</P>
<P>
   Werthen said she hopes that Lake Worth High School will take on
the duty of repopulating Lake Worth with bullfrogs. That way, the
festival can use home-grown talent next year.

U.S. DISCOUNTS DISCORD FOR SAKE OF TALKS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration Wednesday played down
the divisions among its NATO allies over the air war against
Yugoslavia, in what appeared to be a conscious effort not to
accentuate those differences as delicate talks for a peace
settlement were under way.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreements among allies occurred as the Russian envoy,
Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, presented the allies' demands on ending the
war to the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic, in Belgrade. But
behind the scenes Cabinet members and even the president were on
the telephone trying to repair the breach.
</P>
<P>
   The split between Britain and the United States prompted a
90-minute telephone conversation on Tuesday night between Prime
Minister Tony Blair and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Blair was portrayed the previous day as being in favor of
sending ground troops into Kosovo, a move that Clinton had strongly
opposed. Blair's foreign minister, Robin Cook, said in Brussels on
Monday that NATO should be prepared to send an international
security force into Kosovo without the permission of Milosevic,
another position that the White House has opposed.
</P>
<P>
   During the first few minutes of their telephone conversation,
Clinton expressed his displeasure at the stories from London and
Brussels which exposed their differences, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The president asked Blair if he could ``please get control'' of
those who appeared to be speaking on his behalf, one official said.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's talk of ground troops also troubled Clinton because it
played into domestic politics here, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   By promoting a need for ground troops, Blair was inadvertently
allowing a comparison to be drawn between Clinton's reticence on
the issue and the stance of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who favors a
ground operation and has criticized Clinton's failure to embrace
the option.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official explained that Clinton's remarks on
Tuesday, when he said he would not rule out ground troops, were an
attempt to publicly deflect attention from disagreements among the
allies on the subject, a White House official said.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton's plea, the conversation with Blair concentrated
on policy and what moves the alliance should make, the official
said. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also expressed to
colleagues her frustration Wednesday at keeping the alliance intact
as it moved toward its ninth week of the bombing campaign against
Yugoslavia, one of the colleagues said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's main responsibility is to keep the allies in line; on
Tuesday and Wednesday she spoke by telephone to the foreign
ministers of Britain, France, Italy and Germany, said her
spokesman, James P. Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   The top issues she dealt with were the proposal by Italian Prime
Minister Massimo D'Alema for a bombing pause once the U.N. Security
Council adopts a resolution on Kosovo and the statement by German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder that his country would oppose a land
war.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official involved in the Kosovo policy
said the appearances of disarray in NATO were ``very disturbing''
because they served to prolong the war ``we're trying to bring to
an end.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every sign of disarray'' could encourage Milosevic to wait out
the alliance as members showed fatigue, the official said. With
growing signs of discontent among his troops, Milosevic also
appeared to be hurting, but with his firm rule he has the luxury of
disregarding his domestic constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Anxiety about the ambiguous signals from the allies was also
expressed on Capitol Hill, where Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., the
ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, described
the situation within NATO as ``perilous.''
</P>
<P>
   Biden, who has argued since the war began that the future of
NATO depended on success in Kosovo, said he was concerned that as
the air war progressed, fatigue among some allies would mount.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern for the administration is the timing of the
growing divisions within NATO. Administration officials were
downplaying their expectations of what Chernomyrdin might achieve.
It was far from clear what tone Chernomyrdin adopted with the
Yugoslav leader, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian, whom the United States has chosen as the best
chance to bring Milosevic close to NATO's demands, has to decide
what he can sell to his pro-Serbian Russian audience at home and
may turn out to be softer in his tone than the administration would
like, one official said.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomrydin told Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, with
whom he spent time preparing for the encounter with Milosevic, that
he would use the agreement by the seven leading industrial nations
and Russia as his ``talking points,'' an administration official
said.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement, reached two weeks ago, provided a framework for
how to reach a conclusion to the war with Milosevic, but was short
on specifics.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO official familiar with the talks between Talbott and the
Russian envoy in Helsinki on Tuesday and Wednesday said the Russian
had not moved in his position opposing an international security
force with NATO command and control. Further, there was no
agreement on the complete withdrawal of Serb troops from Kosovo
which NATO says it wants, the envoy said.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin was also insisting that a bombing pause, which
Washington opposes, was necessary to test Milosevic's intentions of
withdrawing from the province.

ANGER AT ULTRA-ORTHODOX REVIVES A PARTY IN ISRAEL
</HEADLINE>
   (With ISRAEL-POLITICS) 
(rk) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ When Tommy Lapid left a successful career as a
political commentator and television talk-show host to head the
secular Shinui Party two months ago, it was limping along with
barely enough support to win a seat in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Israeli elections on Monday, after an aggressive,
one-issue campaign directed entirely against ultra-Orthodox
parties, Lapid's new, militant Shinui emerged with six seats,
riding a backlash among secular Israelis against the rising power
of religious parties allied with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   ``We raised the banner of secular rebellion,'' Lapid said in an
interview, taking credit for an electoral swing that also helped
another secular party, Meretz, win 10 seats in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties are likely to join a new governing coalition led by
Ehud Barak, the prime minister-elect, but they face a strengthened
ultra-Orthodox camp, which has grown to 22 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Lapid, 67, has warned that he will not join a coalition with
ultra-Orthodox parties, and he has expressed interest in becoming
justice minister so he can fend off attacks on the judiciary by
ultra-Orthodox leaders angered by rulings they consider
anti-religious.
</P>
<P>
   In Lapid's view, such attacks are a part of ``an ultra-Orthodox
offensive aimed at civil rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Lapid was not always so liberal. During years of work as a
newspaper columnist, radio commentator and the host of the popular
television talk program ``Popolitica,'' he was given to
conservative outbursts.
</P>
<P>
   In one essay he inveighed against what he described as excessive
intervention by the Supreme Court in public affairs. In a
television program after a suicide bus bombing, he compared the
government of Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres to Jewish community
councils appointed by the Nazis to enforce their policies. He has
also grumbled against affirmative action programs promoting the
hiring of women.
</P>
<P>
   But on the issue of ultra-Orthodox influence in Israel, Lapid
has been a staunch secularist. In hard-hitting campaign ads, he
attacked what he called ``religious coercion,'' attempts by the
ultra-Orthodox to regulate public life in Israel according to
religious law.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This assault, as he sees it, reaches all corners of Israeli
life. The rabbis and political leaders challenge the authority of
the Supreme Court, contending that its rulings are anti-religious.
The Labor Ministry, controlled by the Sephardic ultra-Orthodox
party Shas, dispatches inspectors to enforce Sabbath closings on
shops. The Orthodox rabbinate authorizes marriages, supervises
burials and runs a network of kosher inspectors in restaurants and
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, Lapid says, ultra-Orthodox politicians have used
their position to extract generous state allocations for their
schools and institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have milked the state coffers,'' he said, accusing the
ultra-Orthodox of ``extortion.'' Outraged by such language, the
Orthodox leaders have compared Lapid's oratory to anti-Semitic
invective used by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   His high-profile style breathed new life into Shinui after he
was recruited by the party's only legislator, Avraham Poraz.
Running a single-issue campaign that depicted the ultra-Orthodox
parties as a threat to the secular Israeli majority Lapid attracted
growing numbers of voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think Shinui would have won six seats by being
wishy-washy, you're wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An object of ultra-Orthodox rage, Lapid is now accompanied by
bodyguards. At his Tel Aviv apartment Wednesday afternoon, three
police officers arrived to check if he was safe. They were
responding to a message by an anonymous caller who said that Lapid
had been shot.

HOOKING KIDS INTO FISHING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Adds informational chart) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CASTAIC, Calif. _ Call me a sucker for kids with fishing poles,
but there is something entirely magical about those beaming faces
when a flip-flopping trout is brought in at line's end.
</P>
<P>
   As a father whose son is too young yet to participate, I can
only watch and admire in hopes that someday he will be as entranced
as the youngsters I saw fishing during Saturday's trout derby at
Castaic Lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   Those wide eyes may speak volumes, but it's those mouths that
utter some real gems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt slimy. I caught him in my net,'' said 6-year-old
Hannah Nespral of Canyon Country after landing her very first fish.
``He's tired. He needs to take a nap.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, 4-year-old Valencia angler Taylor Tilston had just
reeled in his inaugural catch. ``It felt good. I thought I'd never
catched one,'' he expla{Ngd.
</P>
<P>
   His 2-year-old brother, Trevor, had also reeled in his first
fish, but was clutching his father's leg and sobbing at the thought
his trout would somehow wriggle off the stringer. Dad's promise
that he wouldn't let it swim away wasn't much consolation.
</P>
<P>
   Erica Leary, 14, of Valencia, was on hand to catch rays, not
fish, and oversee her two younger brothers. While she enjoys
angling from a boat, bank-fishing is too slow for her. But she
noted that there's nothing quite like observing children fish:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice when you see their faces when they try to pick up
the fishes and they slide out of their hands and sometimes the fish
whacks them. That's the best part.''
</P>
<P>
   Other answers to the question ``What's the best part about
fishing?'' are often predictably similar from many shy kids:
``Catching fish.'' One can expect the usual, ``It's fun,'' ``Eating
the fish,'' ``I dunno'' or nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, responses can be more revealing, like that of
10-year-old Ryan Whelchel of Newhall, who said, ``Gutting it.'' It
matters little how eloquent children express themselves; they'll
always cherish the experience.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take much to get children started in fishing. As
recommended by Hooked on Fishing International _ which established
a nationwide kids fishing derby program and estimates nearly 800
youth fishing contests will be held throughout the nation this year
_ there are a few simple guidelines. Start a child with tackle
properly sized to the child's stature and skill level, said Gordon
Holland, co-founder of Hooked On Fishing International.
</P>
<P>
   ``A small youngster needs small tackle,'' Holland explained in a
recent release. ``Consider a very short rod, trying to match the
rod length with the child's height. Also, be sure the reel is small
and very light so as to fit comfortably into a child's small hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Proper tackle makes for a more enjoyable fishing experience _
making for a lifetime fishing partner.''
</P>
<P>
   If you ever lose sight of how fun fishing can be or if your
competitive nature gets in the way of having a good time, spend a
morning at a kid's trout derby; you'll get grounded again real
quick. Saturday's derby drew more than 400 anglers ages 15 and
younger. It was part of a larger charitable event known as Bassing
for Abused Kids, which includes a bass-fishing team tournament (see
results in Outpost) and raises money for organizations that assist
abused, abandoned and neglected children in Southern California and
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh annual project collected $38,000 for its
beneficiaries _ Santa Clarita's First Nurturing Touch and Royal
Family Kids Camp of Costa Mesa _ and eclipsed the previous record
of $22,000 established in 1996. Since its inception in 1993,
Bassing for Abused Kids Inc. _ the charity's umbrella agency _ has
raised more than $132,000 through the generosity of sponsors, bass
anglers, raffle-ticket buyers and other contributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something to help somebody else out and have a better
life,'' said Char Arial, whose daughters Sarah, 6, and Angela, 10,
had landed three trout by 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is something very gratifying about a kids fishing
event that aids other kids.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GOOD TIME TO START
</P>
<P>
   One of the best times to introduce kids to rods and reels is
during the state's semiannual Free Fishing Day, the first of which
is June 12, coinciding with National Fishing Week (June 5-13).
</P>
<P>
   While anglers ages 15 and younger never need a state fishing
license, adults must always have one... except on this day and
Sept. 25. With that requirement _ and expense _ out of the way,
Department of Fish and Game officials surmise, there is one more
reason to wet a line with a youngster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great opportunity for families to spend time
together,'' said Jackie Kourassis, coordinator of the state's
``Fishing in the City'' program for Los Angeles and Orange
counties.
</P>
<P>
   The DFG has two free events slated for June 12:
</P>
<P>
   Juneteenth Fishing Derby: From 8 a.m. to noon anglers can vie
for trophies for the heaviest fish caught at Magic Johnson Lake
(formerly Willowbrook Lake), 905 E. El Segundo Blvd. in Los
Angeles, (323) 586-6543. More than 1,500 pounds of catfish will be
planted for the contest. A carnival will begin at 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Family Fish Day: More than 2,500 pounds of catfish will be
stocked for the 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. event at Sante Fe Reservoir, 15501
E. Arrow Highway in Irwindale, (626) 334-1065.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the 22nd annual Kids Fishing Derby for ages 15 and
younger will be held from 8-11:30 a.m. June 5 at Cerritos Regional
County Park, 19700 S. Bloomfield Ave. in Cerritos, (562) 924-5144.
Some 2,200 pounds of catfish will be planted, and trophies and
prizes will be presented for the best catches. A pancake breakfast
will begin at 7 a.m., and lunch also will be available; neither is
free. (Following the event, the lake will be open to adult anglers,
who must have a license on this day.)
</P>
<P>
   For further information on any event, call the DFG's ``Fishing
in the City'' hot line at (562) 590-4835.

DISTRIBUTOR SETTLES FRAUD CASE AGAINST COCA-COLA ENTERPRISES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Ga.)   (bl)  
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Maryland soft-drink distributor that sued Coca-Cola
Enterprises in federal court, accusing the bottler of fraud,
wiretapping and other tactics intended to drive the distributor out
of business, has agreed to drop the charges and settle its case.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Asman, a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola Enterprises, the
Coca-Cola Co.'s largest bottler, said the settlement terms,
completed Friday, were ``strictly confidential.'' But as part of
the settlement, the distributor, B.K. Miller of Clinton, Md., ``has
sold its Coca-Cola assets to Coca-Cola Enterprises and will no
longer be handling products of the Coca-Cola Co.,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As with most settlements, there was no admission of liability
or fault on either side, and all claims were dropped,'' she said.
The case had been scheduled for trial Sept. 14 in U.S. District
Court in Greenbelt, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Mark London, a lawyer for B.K. Miller, confirmed that the case
had been settled but refused to give any details. The family-owned
B.K. Miller sold about 1.6 million cases of Coca-Cola products a
year, making it a significant customer of Coca-Cola Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for B.K. Miller filed the suit in 1997, but the case
first drew wide attention in January, when court papers were
unsealed at the request of The New York Times. The papers included
internal memorandums and documents filed by both sides that
provided an unusual public glimpse of some of the soft-drink
industry's business practices, including secret investigations of
distributors like B.K. Miller by Coca-Cola Co.
</P>
<P>
   B.K. Miller's lawyers argued that Coca-Cola Enterprises wanted
to take over Miller's customers, which included vending accounts
and small stores. They cited a price increase for B.K. Miller,
followed by the bottler's shift in strategy to control more of the
vending business, a highly profitable segment of the soft-drink
industry.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the investigations, a private detective was found to
have filed false reports, which were submitted by lawyers for
Coca-Cola Enterprises to the court as evidence that B.K. Miller was
violating the Soft Drink Inter-Brand Competition Act, a 1980 law
intended to protect small bottlers. Telephone conversations
involving B.K. Miller employees were recorded without the parties'
knowledge, according to the complaint, and other companies were
told not to sell Coca-Cola products to B.K. Miller, because they
were told, the company had transshipped products in violation of
the law, that is, shipped products outside its designated
territory. Miller denied having done so.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Coca-Cola Enterprises countersued B.K. Miller last
November, accusing it of breach of contract, fraud and other
offenses in connection with the transshipping allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Enterprises was spun off from Coca-Cola Co. in 1986
and is a separate, publicly traded company, based in Atlanta. About
43 percent of its stock is held by Coke, its largest shareholder.

   The seventh annual project collected $38,000 for its
beneficiaries _ Santa Clarita's First Nurturing Touch and Royal
Family Kids Camp of Costa Mesa _ and eclipsed the previous record
of $22,000 established in 1996. Since its inception in 1993,
Bassing for Abused Kids Inc. _ the charity's umbrella agency _ has
raised more than $132,000 through the generosity of sponsors, bass
anglers, raffle-ticket buyers and other contributors.

<P>
   ``It's something to help somebody else out and have a better
life,'' said Char Arial, whose daughters Sarah, 6, and Angela, 10,
had landed three trout by 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is something very gratifying about a kids fishing
event that aids other kids.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GOOD TIME TO START
</P>
<P>
   One of the best times to introduce kids to rods and reels is
during the state's semiannual Free Fishing Day, the first of which
is June 12, coinciding with National Fishing Week (June 5-13).
</P>
<P>
   While anglers ages 15 and younger never need a state fishing
license, adults must always have one... except on this day and
Sept. 25. With that requirement _ and expense _ out of the way,
Department of Fish and Game officials surmise, there is one more
reason to wet a line with a youngster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great opportunity for families to spend time
together,'' said Jackie Kourassis, coordinator of the state's
``Fishing in the City'' program for Los Angeles and Orange
counties.
</P>
<P>
   The DFG has two free events slated for June 12:
</P>
<P>
   Juneteenth Fishing Derby: From 8 a.m. to noon anglers can vie
for trophies for the heaviest fish caught at Magic Johnson Lake
(formerly Willowbrook Lake), 905 E. El Segundo Blvd. in Los
Angeles, (323) 586-6543. More than 1,500 pounds of catfish will be
planted for the contest. A carnival will begin at 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Family Fish Day: More than 2,500 pounds of catfish will be
stocked for the 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. event at Sante Fe Reservoir, 15501
E. Arrow Highway in Irwindale, (626) 334-1065.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the 22nd annual Kids Fishing Derby for ages 15 and
younger will be held from 8-11:30 a.m. June 5 at Cerritos Regional
County Park, 19700 S. Bloomfield Ave. in Cerritos, (562) 924-5144.
Some 2,200 pounds of catfish will be planted, and trophies and
prizes will be presented for the best catches. A pancake breakfast
will begin at 7 a.m., and lunch also will be available; neither is
free. (Following the event, the lake will be open to adult anglers,
who must have a license on this day.)
</P>
<P>
   For further information on any event, call the DFG's ``Fishing
in the City'' hot line at (562) 590-4835.

SURPRISE WITNESS SAYS OFFICER BRAGGED OF TORTURING A SUSPECT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Subs first 5 grafs for recasting and clarifications; combines
takes.)   (sw) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In surprise testimony, a police sergeant said on
Wednesday that the officer accused of torturing Abner Louima
boasted to him of carrying out the attack shortly after he said it
took place in the restroom of a Brooklyn police station.
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant, Kenneth Wernick, said that Officer Justin A.
Volpe, using coarse language, told him in detail how he had rammed
a stick into Louima's rectum during the attack in the restroom of
the 70th Precinct station house in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he took a stick and put it five or six inches'' into
Louima's rectum, Wernick testified, ``and took it out and put it by
his mouth and teeth area, kind of like he was showing it to him.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Aside from Louima's own account,  &LR;  Wernick's testimony, his
first public account of the events, was the most direct testimony
yet linking Volpe to a reported act of police torture that shocked
the city.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking rapidly in loud tones in federal District Court in
Brooklyn, Wernick told of a conversation with Volpe that took place
after dawn on Aug. 9, 1997, shortly after prosecutors say Louima
was attacked with the stick by Volpe while another officer on
trial, Charles Schwarz, held him down.
</P>
<P>
   Louima, a 32-year-old Haitian immigrant, had been arrested in a
street melee outside a nightclub in  &UR; the  &LR; Flatbush &UR; section of
Brooklyn &LR; , and prosecutors say Volpe mistakenly thought Louima had
punched him in the disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   Wernick, who held the rank of officer at the time and is now
assigned to the Fifth Precinct in Manhattan, said the conversation
started with Volpe's telling him, ``I took a man down tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Wernick said Volpe then told him about using the stick against
Louima.
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant said Volpe continued his account by saying that he
had hit Louima on the genitals and that he had ``held his hand over
his mouth and told him if he told anybody, he'd kill him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You want to go into the bathroom and see the
stick?''' the sergeant testified as Volpe, at the defense table,
alternated between watching him without expression, shaking his
head and writing in a notebook.
</P>
<P>
   Wernick said Volpe then took him into the station house restroom
to show him the stick.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in another area of the station house, Wernick said he
watched as Volpe pointed the stick at another officer's face and
said, ``Smell this. Smell this.''
</P>
<P>
   Wernick said Volpe then pointed the stick at him and demanded to
know if he could see feces on it. The sergeant testified that he
saw nothing on the stick, which he said was two to three feet long.
</P>
<P>
   Wernick said he last saw Volpe holding the stick outside the
station house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We walked outside by a large Dumpster and he held up the
stick,'' said Wernick, a burly, gray-haired man, holding up his
left arm to show how Volpe was holding the stick, as he sat on the
witness stand next to Judge Eugene H. Nickerson's bench.
</P>
<P>
   He did not say what Volpe did at that point with the stick,
which has never been found.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked away,'' the sergeant continued. ``I didn't want to be
involved at any point.''
</P>
<P>
   But earlier in his account, when Alan Vinegrad, an assistant
U.S. attorney, asked the sergeant whether he had believed that
Volpe had committed the torture, the sergeant said he had not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' Vinegrad asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, because I didn't think anybody would do it,''
Wernick replied. ``And if they did it, they wouldn't talk about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wernick said that Volpe, 27, also gave him a report on the
street fight that had led to the arrest of Louima and a second
Haitian immigrant, Patrick Antoine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said there was a big fight outside some club, they were
acting like animals,'' the sergeant said Volpe had told him.
</P>
<P>
   He said Volpe reported that ``he got punched in the face, chased
a couple of people and caught somebody, but wasn't sure if it was
the guy'' who punched him.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe is also charged with beating Antoine, who had not been
involved in the melee, as he walked on a street near the nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe's laywer, Marvyn M. Kornberg, is expected to begin
cross-examining Wernick on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wernick took the stand, Antoine testified, and in
addition to giving his version of his encounter with Volpe, he told
the jury about statements the officer had made to him as he took
him to the same station house restroom where prosecutors say Louima
had been attacked shortly before and where Sgt. Wernick said Volpe
had shown him the stick.
</P>
<P>
   The statements, as recounted by Antoine _ who testified in
Creole through an interpreter, though he said he understands
English _ included an apology to Antoine for having beaten him in
the street and an admission by Volpe that he had been acting
irrationally that morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me why was I following this guy,'' Antoine said,
apparently referring to someone else Volpe and other officers had
been chasing near the disturbance when Antoine walked by.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I did not know what he was talking about, that I
was just going home and that he beat me,'' Antoine continued,
adding that Volpe ``then said he's sorry, he was feeling crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, Antoine testified, the officer ``told me he
was like somebody who was going crazy'' and that ``when somebody
hits him, he hits the person back.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say that after Louima was arrested, Volpe and
Schwarz and the two other officers on trial, Thomas Wiese and
Thomas Bruder, beat him in a police car before Volpe and Schwarz
attacked him with the stick in the restroom at the police station.
</P>
<P>
   All four are charged with violating Louima's civil rights. A
fifth defendant in the trial, Sgt. Michael Bellomo, is charged with
trying to cover up the reported beating in the police car.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg suggested in questioning Antoine that he had
misunderstood the officers' words during the conversation in
English. The lawyer also got Antoine to acknowledge that even
though he identified Volpe in court as the one who he said had
beaten him in the street, he had not had time to get a good look at
that officer.

PUTTING AROUND THE HOUSE BECOMES MORE POPULAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LAURA VOZZELLA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Tommy Hale was never much of a lawn
fussbudget _ just dragged out the ol' mower once a week and gave it
a quick once-over.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, a particular patch of perfect green grass
governs his thoughts and spare time.
</P>
<P>
   Hale waters twice a day, mows three or four times a week and
fertilizes once a month.
</P>
<P>
   When all that's done, the 50-year-old construction manager putts
on his own professional-grade golf green behind his Mistletoe
Heights bungalow.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're pretty delicate little guys,'' he said of the Tif 328
grass blades that he babies.
</P>
<P>
   Hale is among a growing number of golf enthusiasts willing to
spend thousands of dollars and countless hours installing and
maintaining quality putting greens in their own back yards.
</P>
<P>
   The professional golfers who tee off Thursday at the MasterCard
Colonial tournament in Fort Worth may never suspect that some of
the nicest greens around are tucked inside subdivisions, beside
lake houses and next to garden homes throughout North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Private putting grounds help golfers trim their handicaps _ and
give them a status symbol that makes owners of run-of-the-mill
swimming pools want to hide in the deep end.
</P>
<P>
   Outfitted with amenities such as sand traps and areas with
driving nets, the greens can cost as much as $20,000. Even simple
models installed by do-it-yourselfers run into the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   But the real costs sprout after installation. Caring for the
green can demand as much time, strategy and dedication as the game
itself. The prospect of daily coddling is enough to turn off some
potential putters.
</P>
<P>
   Or turn off their spouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to have to sleep with that mower when I
bought it,'' said Buddy Wisdom, a Granbury retiree who plunked down
$3,700 for a machine to shave his 2,500-square-foot green to
one-eighth inch.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to almost have as much commitment to gardening as to
golfing,'' said Sam Peterson, farm manager of Gardner Turfgrass in
Tioga and Pilot Point.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson said his company gets two or three dozen inquiries a
year from people interested in adding greens to their yards, but
only about a half-dozen go through with it. Another outfit, Thomas
Brothers Grass Co. of Granbury, says it sells sod to about a dozen
home putters a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really try to discourage them, but a good many people
think it's just like keeping their lawn,'' Peterson said. ``With
any turf grass, the shorter you cut it, there's a direct
correlation with depth of root system. That makes it more
susceptible to everything, insects and not having enough
nutrients.''
</P>
<P>
   Putters who pooh-pooh yardwork do have an alternative, and don't
call it Astroturf _ call it ``nondirectional synthetic nylon
putting turf.'' A Colleyville company that installs the stuff says
it is catching on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I envision in the future where these will be just as popular
as having a swimming pool in the back yard,'' said David Bowden,
owner of Bowden's Guaranteed Hydromulch and Sod in Colleyville. In
1992, Bowden's company formed a division, Eagle Putt, specializing
in synthetic greens.
</P>
<P>
   The product used is nylon, knitted into the backing rather than
tufted like most carpets, so it does not create an abnormal roll
for the ball, Bowden said. He still installs natural turf greens,
but he said the low-maintenance artificial turf has made home
greens more popular. His company does about a dozen a year, most of
them synthetic. Cost is about $6,500 to $20,000 either way, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a garden home, so I didn't want any grass. This was a
way to fill in next to my pool,'' said Don Allen, who hired Bowden
to install a 20- by 14-foot synthetic green in his back yard,
overlooking the 18th hole and clubhouse at Timarron Country Club in
the Dallas suburb of Southlake, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Purists may still want real grass, and some discover that they
like puttering around the yard as much as putting in it.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Allen never got a kick out a greenskeeping when he worked
at a golf course in high school. ``Man, I never want to mow another
green,'' he recalls thinking.
</P>
<P>
   But Allen, a professional drag racer who is no relation to Don
Allen, said he has come to enjoy tending the 1,200-square-foot
green he built behind his home in the Fort Worth suburb of
Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   He fondly recalls renting a Bobcat to excavate the site, filling
it with a mixture of sand and peat, and then struggling to keep a
succession of grasses alive and thriving. The latest variety is a
coastal turf. He tilled 25 bushels of hair-thin sprouts into the
soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of relaxing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus,'' he added, ``it's helped my golf game a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   FOR YOUR INFORMATION
</P>
<P>
   How to build a home putting green, according to Dwane Smith, sod
farm manager for Thomas Brothers Grass Co. of Granbury, Texas:
</P>
<P>
   Excavate the area down 10 to 12 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Install drainage pipes.
</P>
<P>
   Bury pipes under pea gravel, then sand.
</P>
<P>
   Contour the area with a variety of slopes so that not all the
putts are the same.
</P>
<P>
   Install sod or put down grass sprigs, choosing a variety
developed specifically for greens, such as Tif 328 or Mini-Verde.
</P>
<P>
   Top-dress with a quarter inch to a half-inch of sand to fill in
all the cracks and undulations.
</P>
<P>
   Water, fertilize and get ready to mow.

U.S. CHARGES EX-SOLDIER, SAYING HE PLOTTED WITH BIN LADEN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.C.)   (rk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The government indicted a former U.S. Army sergeant
Wednesday on charges of collaborating with Osama bin Laden in a
global conspiracy to kill Americans abroad, and asserted publicly
for the first time that the group linked to bin Laden had plotted
to attack the U.S. Embassy in Kenya as early as 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the charges against the former sergeant, Ali A.
Mohamed, who last lived in California, the authorities also
acknowledged that he is the unnamed suspect who has been held in
secret custody in New York since his arrest eight months ago by the
FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Offering many new details about Mohamed, the indictment portrays
him as a crucial figure in bin Laden's organization as early as
1990, just one year after his honorable discharge from the Army. He
served as a supply sergeant assigned to a Special Forces unit at
Fort Bragg, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment does not accuse Mohamed of a role in the embassy
bombings in Africa last August, but it does assert that in the
early 1990s, he offered guerrilla training to Haroun Fazil, who was
charged last year with leading the Nairobi bombing and remains at
large.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed, 46, has been held under highly restrictive conditions
in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan since he
was taken into custody in a secret court proceeding last September.
For the last eight months, the government had been negotiating with
him to win his cooperation in the broad investigation of bin Laden
and his organization.
</P>
<P>
   But those talks ultimately broke down, and the indictment
Wednesday suggests that the chief federal prosecutor in Manhattan,
U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White, has concluded that Mohamed will not
cooperate, or has provided a tainted mixture of truths and lies
that disqualifies him from receiving a formal deal with her office.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed's lawyer, James Roth, who had previously not commented
on the case or even acknowledged that Mohamed was his client, said
Wednesday: ``We will certainly challenge the charges in court, and
we have grave concerns about his ability to get a fair trial, given
the government's campaign to demonize bin Laden.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth refused further comment, and would not respond to questions
about any negotiations that might have taken place.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White's office has also refused to comment on any
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   If Mohamed is convicted, the authorities said, he could face
life in prison without the possibility of parole.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution appears likely to be complicated and intriguing.
If the charges are true, they suggest that Mohamed, a former major
in the Egyptian army who immigrated to the United States in 1985,
had long been living a shadowy double life, even before going to
work for bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, for example, Mohamed made contact with the CIA in
Egypt, seeking to work as a spy, officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency ultimately branded him untrustworthy and his name was
put on a State Department ``watch list'' intended to prevent
terrorists and other security threats from getting visas, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, within a year, Mohamed obtained a visa and moved to the
United States, where he served three years in the Army, obtained
citizenship and developed a relationship with the FBI, acting as an
informant on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   It was during that period, the indictment contends, that he was
also serving bin Laden as a logistics and training expert. It says
he trained members of bin Laden's group, called Al Qaeda, in
Afghanistan, Pakistan and Sudan in urban and guerrilla fighting,
and how to evade surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the indictment says, Mohamed helped to arrange for bin
Laden to move from Peshawar, Pakistan, to Sudan, where bin Laden
was relocating his base of operations.
</P>
<P>
   Within two years, the indictment says, Mohamed was plotting with
other Al Qaeda members to carry out ``a possible attack'' against
the American Embassy in Nairobi in retaliation for the U.S
intervention in the civil war in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1993 and early 1994, Mohamed traveled twice to Nairobi,
the charges say, and on the second trip entered the U.S. Embassy in
what appears to have been a surveillance operation, carrying his
American passport.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, the indictment says, Mohamed and other Al Qaeda
members reviewed plans about ``a possible attack'' on the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Other buildings were also to be attacked, including one that
housed the U.S. Agency for International Development, and British,
French and Israeli interests in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed also traveled that year to Khartoum, Sudan, the
indictment charged, where he provided communications equipment and
security training to bin Laden's bodyguards and to members of the
Sudanese intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
   The government also charged that Mohamed lied to a federal grand
jury last year that was investigating the bombings, and that he
possessed ``terrorist training manuals,'' including documents on
planting explosives in buildings and assassination techniques.

PROSECUTORS HIT SNAG IN CASE AGAINST GROUP OF BROKERS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The federal government's high-profile case against a
group of stockbrokers charged with illegal trading on the floor of
the New York Stock Exchange has run into a significant snag.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Wednesday that they could not prove how much
the defendants profited from the reported scheme, an admission that
appeared to substantially undermine a case brought with great
fanfare last year by Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney for
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The development raises questions about the government's
assertions that as many as 64 other brokers who work on the
exchange floor might also have profited from illegal trading. It
also suggests that such trading can be hard to police, leaving
regulators with few ways to track who is making profits from
questionable trading activity.
</P>
<P>
   The situation has aroused concern at the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which separately is investigating how the New York
Stock Exchange regulates floor brokers and their trading for
clients.
</P>
<P>
   In filing charges in February 1998 against eight brokers,
including an official at the New York Stock Exchange, prosecutors
said the group reaped more than $11 million in illegal trading
profits. The group was said to have traded for accounts in which
they had an interest, a violation of federal securities laws since
traders on the exchange floor have access to valuable information
about orders to buy and sell stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Judge Jed Rakoff, who was preparing to accept guilty
pleas from four stockbrokers and two executives of the Oakford
Corp., which submitted the trades, expressed surprise and dismay at
the government's acknowledgment that it could not calculate the
trading profits. The amount is important since it would help
determine federal sentencing guidelines for those who pleaded
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Rakoff said he might hold his own hearing to
determine monetary damages. At that, the defendants got cold feet,
apparently concerned that they might get stiffer sentences than
they had expected. And the hearing and possible pleas were
postponed until 11 a.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, prosecutors tentatively agreed to drop the
charges against the New York Stock Exchange floor official, John R.
D'Alessio, who was named in last year's indictment. Government
lawyers said ``no direct evidence'' existed that D'Alessio violated
any stock exchange rules.
</P>
<P>
   The government had already won three guilty pleas in its case
against New York Stock Exchange floor brokers, and it appeared to
be substantially widening the case. In a letter earlier this year
to lawyers for the defendants, prosecutors said that they had
substantial evidence that illegal trading was widespread on the
floor of the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   That was exactly what the defendants had been contending _ with
the additional assertion that the exchange only began enforcing
rules against it after the U.S. attorney filed the current case. As
such, the defendants believed that they should not be punished for
something that even a top exchange official said was a longstanding
practice.
</P>
<P>
   That practice was the sharing of profits on trades requested by
firms that were not exchange members; those trades were executed by
brokers on the floor, who received commissions for their work. In
some cases, those commissions were essentially a percentage of the
profits on a trade.
</P>
<P>
   In fighting the charges, the remaining defendants shrugged off
guilty pleas already entered by three brokers who worked on the
exchange floor who also were named in the original indictment. One
of those already had been sentenced to 15 months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the remaining defendants had agreed to plead guilty to
one charge of trading in an account over which they had discretion,
a violation of the exchange's rules.
</P>
<P>
   For the purposes of sentencing, the U.S. attorney's office said
in a statement that ``there was not a reasonable basis upon which
to determine the amount of gain from these specific discretionary
trades, and therefore that there would be no upward adjustment
under the sentencing guidelines for any gain.''
</P>
<P>
   According to lawyers involved in the case, the defendants
expected that they would be subject to federal sentencing
guidelines that could put them behind bars for no more than six
months. And possibly, the lawyers said, they would get no jail time
at all.
</P>
<P>
   The original charges carried prison terms of up to five years,
three years probation and a fine of up to $250,000 or two times the
amount of profits derived from the offense. Federal sentencing
guidelines put the sentence, however, at 15 months to 20 months in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of such a prison term caused defense lawyers to
reconsider their plea agreements, at least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office, said
in a statement that if the defendants do not go ahead with guilty
pleas Thursday, the government will proceed to trial on the
charges. Rakoff has scheduled a trial to begin June 1.

WORLD BANK DELAYS AID SO INDONESIANS CAN'T USE IT TO BUY VOTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Top Clinton administration officials said Wednesday
that they had pressed the World Bank to make sure that more than a
billion dollars in aid to Indonesia was held up for several weeks
so that the country's government could not use it to buy votes in
the first free election there in more than 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   The agency Wednesday announced that Indonesia had
``voluntarily'' agreed to a freeze in use of the money until the
June 7 election is held, even though several hundred million
dollars will be deposited in the next few days in an account under
Indonesia's control.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement reflects the depths of Washington's fears that the
ruling Golkar party, dominated by President Suharto until his
resignation a year ago, would use the money to remain in power.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's handpicked successor, President B.J. Habibie, hopes to
retain the presidency after the parliamentary election, the first
step in a lengthy process to select a president.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin on Wednesday told a subcommittee
of the Senate Appropriations Committee that ``Europe, the United
States and others'' felt that the aid to Indonesia ``ought to be
held up until after the election.''
</P>
<P>
   After Rubin's testimony, Treasury officials corrected his
remarks, saying that some portion of the loans _ by some accounts
more than $400 million _ would be made available almost
immediately. Most of that money is to help Indonesia manage its
water resources, and World Bank officials said several safeguards
would enable them to track the money and make sure it was going to
approved projects.
</P>
<P>
   But the remaining $1.1 billion, about half of which was
originally to have been sent to Jakarta's accounts Tuesday, has
been held up. Much of that money is for what the World Bank calls
``general budget support'' to stimulate the economy, meaning that
it would go directly to the government's main coffers.
</P>
<P>
   As one U.S. official said Wednesday, ``The worry is that it
would end up in little envelopes'' in a country where corruption is
endemic, and at a time when Habibie's party is suffering at the
polls, partly because of the continuing disclosures of corruption
and cronyism during the Suharto era.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the World Bank money, much of which is to help
provide a safety net for those who lost their jobs or fell below
the poverty level during the Asian financial crisis, Jakarta has
plenty of ways to lubricate the election process with cash. It
could, for example, simply print more rupiahs, the nation's
much-devalued currency, but Treasury officials say there is no
evidence it is doing so.
</P>
<P>
   The delay also gives the World Bank and the Clinton
administration some breathing room to assess the outcome of the
election. There are fears in Washington that if the Habibie
government tries to rig the results, violence and political chaos
could follow.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the Indonesia loans is considered particularly
sensitive because the World Bank has acknowledged that much of its
aid to the country has been misused or illegally diverted over the
years. Critics of the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund have pointed to those diversions to press their argument that
the United States should not be using taxpayer dollars, even
indirectly, for such programs.

NEW PALM PILOT WILL LINK TO INTERNET WIRELESSLY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.J., N.Y.)  (rk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Untethering the Internet from desktop computers, the 3Com Corp.
intends on Monday to introduce the first version of its popular
Palm Pilot handheld computer that can tap into cyberspace using
wireless links.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of the unit, the Palm VII, could become a
milestone in the evolution of the Internet, allowing users to link
easily from cars or beaches. Though the Microsoft Corp., Psion of
Britain and other companies are trying to develop software to link
wireless phones to the World Wide Web, the Palm Pilot has already
come to dominate the handheld computer market in the United States
and enjoys a passionately loyal base of customers.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of the Palm VII will also bolster aspirations
by the BellSouth Corp. to remain at the forefront of wireless
communications. The Palm VII uses BellSouth's wireless data
network, which covers most big cities in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Though the new Palm Pilot does not provide phone calls, some
communications analysts and executives believe that will not prove
a huge hindrance. Most wireless phones that include data services
do not allow the user to talk and access the Internet at the same
time, because the screen is pressed against the user's cheek during
a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   3Com intends to make the new product, which will have a list
price of $599, available first in New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut. But people who buy the Palm VII in those areas will be
able to use it around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is now a seamless network,'' said Janet Boudris, senior
vice president for strategic marketing for BellSouth's wireless
data unit. ``So if you get on a plane in New York and get off in
L.A., the service will work seamlessly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palm VII uses a technology known as Web clipping, which
reformats Web pages to fit the Palm Pilot's screen. Among the
operations that have signed up to provide content to the new units
are Espn.com, for sports scores and information; Moviefone.com,
film schedules and reservations; United Parcel Service, package
tracking, and E-Trade stock quotes
</P>
<P>
   3Com initially wants to charge $9.99 a month for a basic package
of services, though a full complement could increase that to $24.99
a month or higher. Different price plans would also include
different numbers of wireless transactions.

SEARCHING FOR A MODERN MACHIAVELLI 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The subject was Machiavelli's relevancy to Beltway
politics, and at first Rep. Henry Hyde listened far more than he
talked. He was strategically quiet in his own way, even when he was
praised as ``the great expert on the ruling couple's
Machiavellianism.''
</P>
<P>
   But finally, as conservative scholars and political operatives
teased him with notions of Machiavelli's 500-year-old hardball
political advice to princes and presidents, Hyde, the leader of the
House Republicans' failed attempt to purge President Clinton from
office, could no longer resist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see Machiavellian pragmatism behind just about everything he
does,'' Hyde said, his tone more that of observing a universally
stipulated fact than of flashing an oratorical blade into his White
House nemesis. ``Machiavelli didn't have pollsters, interestingly
enough. This guy does, and he'll follow them slavishly without any
real principle or core conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Hyde, seeming amiable as ever, finally asked the one
question that he had for the Machiavelli forum at the American
Enterprise Institute, a decidedly partisan gathering where no one
was of a mind to defend Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would Machiavelli have approved of President Clinton's defense
in the impeachment, which was really spin?'' the impeachment
manager asked, wide-eyed with curiosity about whether expediency
should trump morality in political success.
</P>
<P>
   In a way the question hung in the air for the duration of the
90-minute forum Monday evening, lest even back-handed praise of
Clinton ever be uttered at such a gathering.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Michael A. Ledeen, the institute's resident scholar,
Reagan administration veteran of the Iran-Contra intrigues and
author of a new book on Machiavelli's modern utility, went for a
laugh line rather than a flat answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, Machiavelli was in favor of impeachment  &UR; and &LR; 
conviction,'' he insisted to general laughter.
</P>
<P>
   But then Ledeen offered what he rates as one of the ultimate
Machiavellian quotations in condemnation, if not praise, of the
Clinton presidency, citing the Renaissance master strategist's
analysis of why Italian princes failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought,'' Ledeen quoted, ``that it sufficed for a prince
in the writing rooms of palaces to think up a sharp reply, to write
a beautiful letter, to demonstrate wit and readiness in saying
words, to know how to weave a fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience, steeped in a kind of post-impeachment tristesse
that nags at the capital city, was hushed with delight as he
continued quoting: ``To keep many lascivious women around, to
conduct himself avariciously and proudly, to rot in idleness.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the audience merriment at that, Hyde, listening
carefully, seemed to withhold the ultimate political compliment
from the president _ that he had been triumphantly Machiavellian
across the past year of his sex-and-mendacity scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have mediocrities in positions of power,'' Hyde fairly
sighed in summarizing the problem of a contemporary political
establishment that, Democrats would point out, includes himself.
``Oh, I shouldn't say that,'' he added. ``We have  &UR; rhetorical &LR; 
mediocrities.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from an unabashed round of Clinton bashing, the forum
provided a glimpse at the folkways of this city's mutually grooming
political class, right and left, that could hardly be surprising to
Niccolo Machiavelli. ``Loved your piece,'' one conservative
polemicist said in greeting another star from the op-ed firmament.
</P>
<P>
   In belaboring the president, Ledeen did not find an entirely
open field for his thesis that ``Machiavelli is now, as half a
millennium ago, probably the most contemporary of all political
commentators.'' Irving Kristol, the neo-conservative patriarch,
smiled in cutting his friend off at the polemical pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all for letting a bit of Machiavelli enter our souls _ but
not too much,'' Kristol said, conceding frustration at the ``mush''
of modern statesmanship but accusing Ledeen of going overboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's much too nice to Machiavelli, who was one of the most
wicked men who ever lived,'' Kristol continued, cautioning modern
readers to take Machiavelli more literally than satirically in his
cunning prescriptions for wielding power and knifing friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``A real nasty piece of work,'' he said, comparing Machiavelli
with the Marquis de Sade in liberating general discourse while
taking credit for some larger sagacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realize that it's better to read him than to read the Charter
of the United Nations _ it makes more sense,'' Kristol maintained,
drawing laughter. Ledeen argued that Machiavelli, for all his
intriguing ways, was above all opposed to self-indulgent leaders.
</P>
<P>
   As the conservatives sought to come to terms with the man from
Florence and the one from Hope, the most shocking observation may
have been offered by former CIA Director James Woolsey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Machiavellian doesn't always mean cynical or relying on fear;
love can get the job done,'' the one-time spy master insisted,
citing George Washington's weathering a hard-times rebellion in the
Colonial Army by the sheer power of the troops' affection for him.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Hyde held out no such hope for the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, we desperately need leaders,'' he said. Then again he
brightened in looking beyond Clinton. He cited a new bumper sticker
he saw in Texas. ``Nixon in 2000 _ he's not as stiff as Gore,'' the
Illinois congressman quoted with a big Machiavellian grin.

FEBRUARY WINDOW KEY TO MCCAIN PRESIDENTIAL STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign has
developed a strategy that relies on wresting momentum from Texas
Gov. George W. Bush in the early New Hampshire primary, then
decisively winning McCain's home state of Arizona a week later.
</P>
<P>
   McCain aims to bruise Bush, the Republican front-runner, in New
Hampshire and beat him in Arizona. McCain then plans to shift his
focus to South Carolina, whose ``First in the South'' GOP primary
is expected to follow Arizona's by four days in February 2000.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's approach, revealed in interviews this week with members
of his campaign staff, appears to have little margin for error
because it pinpoints, by necessity, a very small window of time.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year of campaigning and fund-raising could come down to
three states whose primaries are expected to be held just 11 days
apart _ from Feb. 15-26. Strategists for McCain, who declared his
candidacy in April, believe he must mount a successful early
challenge to keep Bush from walking away with the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Although the dates won't be finalized until summer, the
candidates expect New Hampshire's primary to be on Feb. 15,
followed by Arizona's on Feb. 22, and South Carolina's on Feb. 26.
McCain aides said he will also concentrate on California's March 7
primary, assuming he is still a viable candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa, a traditional early powerhouse in the presidential
nominating process, does not figure prominently in McCain's plans.
Although he insists he's not skipping Iowa altogether, McCain
apparently decided it wasn't worth it to painstakingly build the
county-by-county organization that is typically needed to turn out
Iowa voters on a cold winter's night.

CSUN'S PRIETO LEADS BIG SKY HEPTATHLON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KIRBY LEE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Brandi Prieto of Cal State Northridge was not
thrilled to be competing in the heptathlon at the Big Sky
Conference championships on Wednesday at CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   Neither was the rest of the heptathlon field.
</P>
<P>
   Prieto, a five-time Big Sky Conference triple-jump champion,
posted personal bests in three of the four events to finish as the
first-day leader with 3,088 points in the two-day, seven-event
competition. LaShaunda Fowler of Northridge is second with 2,920
and Hillary Merkley of Idaho State is third with 2,873.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can ask anybody I know and they will tell you I am a
triple-jumper who happens to do the heptathlon,'' Prieto said.
``This is not something I want to do for a long time. I was not too
enthused about it but I am learning to like it because I am
starting to do well.''
</P>
<P>
   The lanky 5-foot-10 Prieto took the lead from the start
Wednesday, posting the top marks in the first two events, the
100-meter hurdles (14.0 seconds) and the high jump (5-4\). Prieto's
time in the 100 hurdles shaved nine-hundredths of a second off her
previous best. She was only a quarter of an inch off her
career-best in the high jump.
</P>
<P>
   Competing in only her second heptathlon, Prieto also threw a
personal-best 32-11 in the shot put. The junior finished the
afternoon clocking 25.88 in the 200, dipping under 26 seconds for
the first time in the half-lap event.
</P>
<P>
   Prieto scored a conference-leading 4,710 points in her first
heptathlon last month at Azusa Pacific, but Wednesday's showing
placed her 210 points ahead of that pace. Prieto's objective was to
build a solid first-day lead to take pressure off the second day _
and the remainder of the meet.
</P>
<P>
   The heptathlon concludes today with the long jump, javelin and
800 meters. Competition in the meet, which runs through Saturday,
begins today with the decathlon at 10:45 a.m. The heptathlon starts
at noon.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the heptathlon, Prieto, who has provisionally
qualified for the NCAA championships in the triple jump with a Big
Sky record 42-11}, will compete in the 100 hurdles, long jump and
triple jump. Fowler is entered in the 100, 100 hurdles and long
jump. The two will also team on Northridge's 1,600 relay in the
Matadors' bid for its second outdoor title in three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually when I PR in something, I immediately want to do
something better,'' Prieto said. ``I am just trying to beat what I
already had. Hopefully the points will come. I am not going to
worry about the 800 while I am doing the long jump. I m-H5ust

CANDIDATE'S BROTHER ACCUSED OF MAKING THREATS WITH A HANDGUN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A brother of Patrick J. Buchanan, the presidential
candidate and conservative commentator, will surrender to the
police on charges he threatened people with a handgun at the home
of a relative of a top State Department official, the Buchanan
family said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The family said Hank Buchanan, 61, who has a history of mental
illness, had checked himself into a hospital for treatment after
the incident on Sunday at the Northwest Washington home of Cody
Shearer, the brother-in-law of Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott.
</P>
<P>
   Shearer issued a statement Wednesday saying he had received
anonymous death threats after being identified last week on the
cable-television program ``Hardball With Chris Matthews'' as the
man who tried to intimidate Kathleen E. Willey, a former White
House volunteer who has accused President Clinton of making an
unwanted sexual advance. Other media outlets repeated Matthews'
assertion.
</P>
<P>
   Shearer told the District Police that an intruder broke into his
garage on Sunday, slashed the tires on his cars, then waved a
handgun at two house guests who confronted him. The intruder fled
in a car parked nearby, and one of the guests noted the
license-plate number, Shearer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hank, through me, is fully cooperating with the authorities
and hopes to resolve this to everyone's satisfaction,'' said Tom
Buchanan, a lawyer who is representing his brother.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Buchanan ran his own accounting firm but has had a history
of manic depression. ``He had been doing very well, and this is a
terrible setback,'' his sister Bay Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   Shearer said he ``categorically denies'' any intimidation of Ms.
Willey, and Matthews apologized on Tuesday night for mentioning
him. ``I now regret not having spoken beforehand with him before I
mentioned his name on the air,'' Matthews told viewers. ``I should
never have brought his name up until we had vetted it.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Buchanan has visited his brother in the hospital and
will issue a statement on Thursday, Bob Adams, the candidate's
chief spokesman, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Willey has said that a man approached her outside her
Richmond, Va., home in January 1998, two days before she was to
give a deposition in Paula Jones' sexual-misconduct suit against
the president. The man asked her about her missing cat and her
children and noted that her tires had been slashed, she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Shearer said he was in California at the time, and has a
reputable witness to prove it _ former Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, who by coincidence sat next to him on a plane.

MARTHA STEWART, OTHER CEO'S ALL BUSINESS AT MICROSOFT SUMMIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ A perfect question to ask decor and
entertainment doyenne Martha Stewart at Microsoft's third annual
CEO Summit, which began Wednesday at the company's headquarters
here, might have been:
</P>
<P>
   ``America needs to know: Just what do you use for wallpaper on
your PC?''
</P>
<P>
   But early in the question-and-answer period following the
summit's kickoff address, Stewart made it clear she wouldn't
welcome that frivolity. Like the other 100 or so company heads
gathered here from throughout the United States, the chairman and
chief executive officer of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia LLC had
come to Redmond on business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wears a little thin when people constantly ask me (at
meetings like this) what we're having for lunch,'' she said. ``Our
e-commerce business is alive and well and thriving, and the
information I'm gathering here will help me add value.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart and her colleagues, who collectively head companies
employing 6 million people, are spending three days exchanging
ideas on the role technology should play in their operations.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other attendees: Larry Bossidy, chairman and CEO of
AlliedSignal Inc., Michael Dell, chairman and CEO of Dell Computer
Corp., Jacques Nasser, president and CEO of Ford Motor Co., and
Paul O'Neill, chairman and CEO of Alcoa.
</P>
<P>
   They said getting the right information quickly into the hands
of workers who need it remains a critical objective for business.
That goal will be addressed in sessions such as ``Turning
information into knowledge'' and ``Integrating strategy and
information technology'' during the summit.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the meeting's purpose to tout Microsoft's own
offerings, Microsoft Chairman and CEO Bill Gates stressed in his
keynote address. In fact, ``It's a checkpoint on our technology _
CEOs ask us why it isn't easier,'' Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft technology did intrigue the participants, to judge
from the buzz. Attention centered on Digital Dashboard, a modified
version of the Microsoft Outlook e-mail interface that presents
workers on a corporate intranet (internal network) with a windowed,
customizable mixture of information.
</P>
<P>
   That could include a running stock ticker, icons for accessing
news items, specially categorized and ordered by priority for each
user or groups of users, and the ability to hear phone voice mail.
</P>
<P>
   It could also include key financial information clickable for
increasing layers of detail, real-time messaging, and the ability
to participate in virtual meetings complete with video.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those features can be made wireless and accessible
through palmtop computers. A wireless network tying together the
entire Microsoft campus is under construction, Gates said. In the
two buildings where it's already working, ``We can't get employees
to accept being moved, they're so into it,'' said Dan Leach, a
Microsoft spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   AlliedSignal's Bossidy said, ``We have dashboards, but they
aren't digitized yet. I'm gonna have a chat with our folks and find
out how far away we are from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Digital Dashboard can be created from Microsoft software in
existence today through advanced programming, said Jeff Raikes,
Microsoft's group vice president of sales and support.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also used the summit Wednesday to show off ClearType,
the replacement for the TrueType font system that the company hopes
will make electronic books a reality.
</P>
<P>
   This new font-rendering engine triples the clarity of type
displayed onscreen by controlling each of the three electron beams
making up each pixel, explained Bill Hill, who helped develop the
technology. Currently, the three beams can be controlled only as a
group. ClearType will be part of a forthcoming version of
Microsoft's Windows or Windows NT, although Microsoft won't say
which one.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is absorbing not just more attention but more money
at many companies, the CEOs said. Companies have typically spent
between 2 percent and 4 percent of their annual budgets on
information technology. But as electronic commerce, intranets and
e-mail become increasingly widespread within companies' operation,
``information technology is no longer discrete,'' so it's harder to
quantify that expenditure, said Ford's Nasser.
</P>
<P>
   The summit won't be all business. Some of the CEOs are rumored
to be dining at Gates' Medina mansion. Martha Stewart was probably
not asked to help cook.

FIRST LADY PROMOTES GRAND CANYON TRAIL SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>

 and STEVE YOZWIAK

<P>
   GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK _ With the Grand Canyon as a
backdrop, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday launched a
73-mile network of trails designed to help end drive-by visits to
Arizona's premier natural wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the Grand Canyon Greenway will ``reconnect us to
our own country,'' so that visitors will know ``what it looks like,
what it smells like.''
</P>
<P>
   She visited the South Rim as part of her ``Save America's
Treasures'' tour, which this week included a four-day swing through
the Southwest, with stops at Flagstaff's Lowell Observatory,
Bandelier National Monument in New Mexico and Mesa Verde National
Park in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   It's part of a national tour designed to help preserve important
cultural and historic sites. Clinton also is promoting her
Millennium Trails, a program designed to link communities with
trails for hikers, bikers, wheelchairs and people on horseback.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Grand Canyon is a place that deserves our attention, our
resources, our stewardship,'' Clinton said on the lawn of the
historic El Tovar Lodge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We imagine a network of miles of trails connecting every
community in America.''
</P>
<P>
   The First Lady cited efforts to preserve the nation's
``underground railroad,'' the South-to-North route of escaped
slaves; urban trails in Baltimore and New York City; and a trail on
the banks of the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Clinton announced 62 grants totalling $30
million for historic preservation, including money for: the Honanki
prehistoric cliff dwelling near Sedona, Mission San Jose near
Tumacacori, Theodore Roosevelt School at Fort Apache, and the Vail
Ranch House in Sonoita.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lose our history, we lose our collective memory and we
endanger our future,`` Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   She was joined at the ceremony by Grand Canyon Superintendent
Rob Arnberger, who helped develop the Greenway project. He said the
trail system would help visitors better enjoy the sights of the
canyon, allowing them to smell pine trees instead of car exhaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will separate the park experience from the parking
experience,'' Arnberger said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Axelson, a trail designer confined to a wheelchair after a
rock-climbing accident, said the new trails will help enable him to
experience the beauty of the canyon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Grand Canyon was always a place that I was a little afraid
to come to. This Greenway is going to provide a way for Americans
of all abilities to experience the `grand' in Grand Canyon,''
Axelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the $46 million trails project, which is
expected to begin later this fall, was funded through state,
federal and private grants.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with planned light-rail and electric-bus mass
transportation, the new trails will help eliminate cars from the
park.
</P>
<P>
   Cars in recent years have caused congestion, pollution and noise
along the canyon's scenic overlooks, which park officials and
visitors say degrades the experience of visiting the park.
</P>
<P>
   The trails would include bike racks, shelters, toilets, bridges
and tunnels that would minimize environmental damage and minimize
the need for any road crossings.
</P>
<P>
   The trails are planned to start at the Canyon View Information
Plaza, currently under construction at Mather Point, which would be
one of two light-rail transportation stations inside the park. The
other light-rail station would be at the Maswic transportation
center at Grand Canyon Village. Both would receive visitors who
would board outside the park at a light-rail station in Tusayan.
</P>
<P>
   The trails would run parallel to the light-rail system between
Mather Point and Tusayan. They also would run along the south rim
of the canyon: west from Mather Point to Hermit's Rest and east
from Mather Point to Desert View.
</P>
<P>
   Trails also are planned on the north rim, connecting Grand
Canyon Lodge, Point Imperial and Cape Royal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit also comes within weeks of an expected decision
by the U.S. Forest Service on a massive land trade just outside the
park's main entrance near Tusayan.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate anticipated growth in tourism, a Scottsdale firm,
Canyon Forest Village, wants to build thousands of hotel rooms,
restaurants and retail outlets. Along with a new natural history
museum and land for local housing, schools and other community
facilities, the project possibly would connect to the planned
light-rail system into the park.
</P>
<P>
   That plan, however, is contingent on the Kaibab National Forest
trading nearly a square mile of land to Canyon Forest Village. In
exchange, Canyon Forest Village would give nearly three square
miles of private land - former homesteads scattered throughout the
forest - to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Canyon Forest Village would include 1,270 hotel rooms and
270,000 square feet of retail space. It has been endorsed by
several environmental groups because water for the project will be
shipped by rail and pipeline from the Colorado River near the
Arizona-California border. It would have no effect on springs
inside the canyon.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service also is considering a plan to accommodate
future tourism that would not require a land trade. That plan is
proposed by a coalition of Tusayan businesses.

CASH SOUGHT FROM BIG FIRM IN '98 LETTER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BARSTOW with JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, a leading securities firm
embroiled in a racial discrimination dispute with a former
employee, received a letter last August demanding a $15,000 payment
from a police informant who helped arrange a sting operation that
was about to result in the employee's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Just days before Christian Curry, the dismissed employee, was
arrested last August for conspiring to plant evidence that would
bolster a discrimination lawsuit against the firm, the police
informant, Charles J. Luethke, sent a letter to Morgan Stanley's
legal department demanding a cash advance ``for services
rendered.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Curry, who is black, finally filed that
discrimination lawsuit, which included charges of false arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley denied any wrongdoing. But days after Curry's
arrest, the firm wired $10,000 into an account designated by the
informer, the Manhattan district attorney's office said this week.
Morgan Stanley also failed to disclose the payment to prosecutors,
which prompted the district attorney's office on Tuesday to dismiss
all charges against Curry and instead focus their investigation on
the informer and several Morgan Stanley officials.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley officials declined Wednesday to discuss details
of the $10,000 payment, saying they did not want to compromise the
continuing investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that our conduct and the conduct of our employees
in this matter was entirely appropriate and legal,'' said Jeanmarie
McFadden, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McFadden confirmed that Morgan Stanley received the Aug. 13
letter from Luethke, but she said that it did not accurately
describe his conversations with the firm. Luethke, a college
acquaintance of Curry, wrote a series of letters to the company
last summer in which he described his plan of helping Morgan
Stanley defend itself against a possible lawsuit from Curry. Four
months earlier, Curry was let go from the firm. The firm continues
to contend he was dismissed for expense account abuse, but the
dismissal came shortly after nude pictures of him found their way
into a gay men's magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Letters from Luethke to various employees of the firm do not
represent actual discussions between Morgan Stanley and Luethke,''
Ms. McFadden said, declining to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   The Aug. 13 demand for $15,000 was addressed to Carol Bernheim,
a lawyer for Morgan Stanley who handles employee relations.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New York
Times, Luethke asked Morgan Stanley to help him establish his own
business. ``In addition,'' he continued, ``I would like a cash
advance of $15,000 for services rendered to MS thus far. It would
be an unnecessary risk for my girlfriend and me to be in the New
York area when Christian is arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   Luethke could not be reached for comment Wednesday, but on
Tuesday denied that he was paid by Morgan Stanley to inform on
Curry.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of his Aug. 13 letter to Morgan Stanley, Luethke
introduced Curry to an undercover police officer posing as a
computer hacker. The undercover officer told Curry that he could
plant bogus e-mail in Morgan Stanley's computer system to bolster
the discrimination lawsuit he was threatening. According to the
police, Curry paid the officer $200 and provided him with a fake
e-mail that contained racist and homophobic comments about him.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Curry intended to then cite bogus e-mail as
evidence of bigotry on the part of senior Morgan Stanley
executives. Instead, he was arrested August 20 and charged with
forgery, conspiracy and trespass of a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Those charges were dropped on Tuesday, clearing the way for
Curry's lawsuit.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Morgan Stanley Dean Witter regrets the decision on the part of
the district attorney's office to drop the charges against
Christian Curry,'' Ms. McFadden said. `` Curry's own criminal
attorney has conceded that Curry paid money to an undercover
officer to plant phony e-mail in our system to bolster a civil case
that he threatened to bring against the firm.''
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit, filed in New York State Supreme Court, Curry
contends that the firm had ``a permissive and encouraging
environment'' for discrimination on the basis of race and perceived
sexual orientation. That climate extended to the executive suite,
the lawsuit contends. It names Phillip Purcell, chairman and chief
executive, John Mack, the president, and 12 other officials
including Ms. Bernheim at the firm as co-defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint details more than a dozen specific incidents of
reported discrimination. It states, for example, that immediate
superiors questioned Curry about why he wore a necktie bearing the
logo of Shinnecock Hills, an exclusive golf club in the Hamptons,
joking that Curry, as a black man, must have been a caddy, not a
full member.
</P>
<P>
   During a Christmas party, fellow Morgan Stanley employees
pressed Curry to wear an ``Afro wig'' and a pair of ``big lips'' in
order to poke fun at a black superior, the suit said. In another
reported incident, the suit contends that Curry was the only member
of an investment banking team excluded from a dinner at Le Cirque,
an upscale Manhattan restaurant, held to celebrate the closing of a
real estate finance deal.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McFadden of Morgan Stanley said the firm had not seen the
suit and had no comment on its specifics. But she said, ``As a
matter of policy, we do not tolerate discrimination or harassment
in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   Curry, who said he was not gay, contended in his suit that after
pictures of him appeared in Playguy magazine, the firm decided to
dismiss him. Executives used expense account irregularities as a
``pretext'' for doing so, the suit says. The irregularities
included expenses incurred by Morgan Stanley clients at an adult
entertainment club, the suit says, adding that white bankers at
Morgan Stanley regularly charged the firm for client entertainment
as such establishments.

SPORTS COLUMN: HAWKS' MUTOMBO DOWNSIZES HIS DREAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As a child he dreamed of being a doctor, but when he
grew to be 7 foot 2, Dikembe Mutombo modified that dream. Now he
would build a hospital where doctors can save lives in his home
country of Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the lofty dreams of this lofty man are being
hampered. He says he has been unable to raise nearly as much money
as he had planned because of the lockout, and also because of
apathy from his fellow players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought guys would be more generous _ maybe $100,000 from
some of them,'' the Atlanta Hawks' Mutombo said Wednesday. ``But I
would say maybe seven to 10 guys contributed a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Mutombo will practice his own form of medicine _
vigorous elbow therapy _ upon the visiting New York Knicks in the
second game of their playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as elbows go, I would say he is right near the top,''
said Chris Dudley.
</P>
<P>
   If Mutombo were not such a jovial adult off the court, it would
almost seem that he was drumming up business for some bone-setting
clinic. However, he is far from a goon or a hacker, and equates
himself most with Bill Russell, the great defensive hub of the old
Boston Celtics and, while far more social than Russell ever was, he
also holds strong opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire him for not forgetting where he came from,'' said
Dudley, who is also known for his charitable impulses.
</P>
<P>
   Mutombo sees the world from the perspective of an African man
whose family includes teachers and surgeons. He came to Georgetown
from Congo, formerly known as Zaire, speaking French as well as
several African dialects, and majored in languages and diplomacy,
even if his beliefs are not always diplomatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``One year I took some guys to Africa, and they wanted to know
where they would stay,'' he said. ``They did not know we had hotels
in Kinshasa. I blame the school systems in America. They let people
choose what they want to study, so people do not know much about
the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   After four years at the John Thompson Institute for the
Vertically Gifted, he was ready to make a living.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very lucky,'' Mutombo said with his throaty accent. ``At
first I could make $3 million a year, and now I can make much more.
I realized that I could give money and it would be a tax exemption.
I wonder why other players do not do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, many players do give money to charity, but few seem
as openly involved in their causes as he is with the Dikembe
Mutombo Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I see it, everybody leaves the earth sometime,'' he
said. ``Most of us leave it from a hospital bed. I want more beds
in a region of 10 million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hospital is supposed to be a $44 million project,'' he
added. ``The building is not so expensive, but the facilities cost
money. In my country, one out of 10 newborn children have a chance
to die. One out of 10 mothers have a chance to die. There is
tuberculosis and malaria. I'm trying to be part of the solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he fears he may have to downsize his dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lockout killed us,'' said Mutombo, who served on the
negotiating committee, along with Dudley. ``If we had 82 games and
started on time, I could have made appearances in every city, the
night before a game, to raise funds. But I never got a chance
because we could not plan it.''
</P>
<P>
   He does not mind saying he is also saddened by the lack of
response from his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe every professional player should have a better sense
of giving back to society,'' he said Wednesday. ``Look at how
people are suffering. We got our chance. We make a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night he will try to stop his friend, Patrick Ewing,
with Alonzo Mourning, the third member of the Georgetown
triumvirate, whose Miami team lost to the Knicks in the first
round, expected to be in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   There is the notion that both Mourning and Mutombo have been
deferential to Ewing over the years, perhaps internalizing
Thompson's frequent comments that ``Patrick comes first'' among the
equals. Ewing showed ferocity toward Mutombo on Tuesday night,
throwing a vicious elbow for his fifth personal foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I think he was just frustrated because of all the fouls,''
Mutombo said. ``Afterward, I drove him to the hotel. We did not
talk about the game. Actually, he was more interested in talking to
my little girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Mutombo is soft when he talks about his friends. His elbows
speak a language of their own, but they are supporting his dreams.

HAWKS' BACKCOURT LOSES A BIT OF LUSTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mookie Blaylock was exhausted Tuesday night. Early in
the fourth quarter, the player entrusted to kick-start the Atlanta
Hawks' offense committed a turnover that led to a jump shot by
Allan Houston on the other end of the court. He did not bother to
run downcourt to play defense, and a minute later he asked to be
taken out of the game by coach Lenny Wilkens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just running wild and kind of got tired,'' said
Blaylock, Atlanta's point guard. ``That's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Wilkens: ``That's what happened. I thought he got caught up
in a frenzy.''
</P>
<P>
   If Atlanta had one distinct advantage going into its Eastern
Conference semifinal with the New York Knicks, it was its
swaggering starting backcourt. With their ability to score and
defend, the dogged Blaylock and the cocksure shooting guard Steve
Smith were supposed to present New York with serious matchup
problems.
</P>
<P>
   But with Blaylock out of kilter, Smith severely limited by foul
trouble in Atlanta's Game 1 loss and a corn-silk thin bench, the
Hawks are reeling heading into Game 2 on Thursday at the Georgia
Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Smith picked up his fourth foul with 10 minutes 9 seconds to go
in the third quarter after putting his team up by 8 on a jumper
with 9 minutes left in the quarter. The Knicks proceeded to go on a
40-15 run.
</P>
<P>
   Without Smith's defensive intensity, it was no coincidence that
Houston scored 19 of his 34 points in that run. Smith finished with
25 points on 6-of-17 shooting and 12 of 14 free throws, but he
could not post up as easily after Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy put
Larry Johnson on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy the challenges, and I'm going to take the challenges
no matter who I play against,'' Smith said. ``I think you
definitely have to get physical. Me having four fouls at the
beginning of the third quarter, I couldn't get physical.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what the Hawks were trying to do on defense, he added,
``What did we do? Nothing. They hit every shot, they had too many
easy looks. We weren't physical with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Hawks were trying to paint their series-opening
loss as an aberration, a game in which they simply gave up too many
open shots and took poor ones on the other end of the court.
</P>
<P>
   But you have to wonder how aggressive Smith will be after his
foul trouble in Game 1, and how winded Blaylock is after playing
more than 40 minutes in Game 5 of Atlanta's victory over Detroit
and 38 minutes on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   For all their critics, the defense of Charlie Ward and Chris
Childs took Tim Hardaway out of the first round. Now, they have
opposing players taking themselves out of games.
</P>
<P>
   If that's not enough, Latrell Sprewell and Houston combined for
65 points in the 100-92 victory. It was only the third time this
season Atlanta gave up 100 points or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``They present a big problem,'' Smith said of Sprewell and
Houston. ``They both can run and shoot. The thing is for us, when
Patrick went out of the game, they run more. We don't want Patrick
to get into foul trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing played only 17 minutes Tuesday, allowing the Knicks'
transition game to take over the proceedings. The matchup between
him and Dikembe Mutombo never materialized, giving way to a
high-octane offense unveiled by the Knicks against the league's top
defensive team.
</P>
<P>
   Mutombo, Smith and Blaylock did not act Wednesday as if they had
a sense of urgency about Game 2, and seemed to be almost dismissive
about the way they played Tuesday. ``If it was Game 4, maybe then I
would be worried,'' Mutombo said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Smith, ``We definitely didn't want to give up homecourt,
but it's not like we don't think we can go into New York and not
win a game.''

SPORTS COLUMN: A NEW FENWAY PARK OFFERS YANKS A LESSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since the Fleet Center replaced the Boston Garden,
basketball has never been the same where America's jockey, Paul
Revere, yelled ``The British are coming'' more than 200 years ago
</P>
<P>
   According to most of New England's current colonists, the Fleet
Center has no charm. Of course, the Celtics have no players and the
Bruins aren't much better, but in Boston, charm is more important
than a modern look. Something, anything, can be new in Boston, but
ideally, it somehow should look as old as the Old North Church.
</P>
<P>
   Wisely, that is the thinking behind the Red Sox plan for a new
Fenway Park to be built across the street from where Fenway Park
has stood since 1912 and where a World Series flag has not been
raised since 1918. It's a plan that should be required reading for
the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Red Sox were cursed by Babe Ruth's departure,
they have not been able to beat the Yankees when it counts. But if
the Red Sox can create a new Fenway Park with the charm of the
original Fenway Park, the Yankees should be able to create a new or
renovated Yankee Stadium with the grandeur that has been Yankee
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The new Fenway Park would retain the charm of the Wall, alias
the Green Monster, in left field. It would retain what is known as
Pesky's Pole, the right-field foul pole struck by eight of Johnny
Pesky's career 17 home runs, or so he says. It would retain ``the
triangle'' in the center-field wall, alias Conigliaro's Corner.
</P>
<P>
   It would also retain the bullpens beyond right field, the manual
scoreboard and the green-painted ladder up the Wall to the screen
where Bucky Dent's homer landed to help the Yankees win the 1978
American League East playoff.
</P>
<P>
   In retaining the virtual dimensions that confronted the Babe,
Teddy Ballgame and Yaz, the new Fenway Park would retain, in a
word, its charm while curing the ailments of the old Fenway Park.
There will be no obstructed views and twice as many restrooms.
</P>
<P>
   When and if it opens in 2003, there will also be more and wider
seats, 44,120 (including 100 luxury suites and 5,500 club seats)
instead of 33,871, the better to help the Red Sox, along with city
and state politicians (most of whom seem to favor the plan), pay
for its proposed total cost: $545 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox plan to raise $350 million; the city and state will
be asked to supply $195 million in condemned land, two parking
garages and improved traffic patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Not that all of the current colonists like the Red Sox plan.
Many in the Fenway Park neighborhood want to renovate the old ball
park. Some politicians don't want to contribute taxpayers' money.
And even among those who favor a new ball park, some don't want a
replica of the Wall; it backfires more than it helps.
</P>
<P>
   The pro football Patriots had a hard time squeezing $70 million
in state funds before abandoning Hartford, but the Patriots aren't
the Red Sox _ and Foxboro isn't Boston.
</P>
<P>
   For all its potential problems, the Red Sox plan should be
examined by the Yankees, as well as by New York's city and state
politicians, in deciding Yankee Stadium's future.
</P>
<P>
   Every year for a few years now, George Steinbrenner has insisted
he will address the Stadium issue when the season ends. After all,
doomsday is approaching; the Yankees' lease at the Stadium expires
in 2002. But when next season arrives every year, as this one has,
he still hasn't addressed it.
</P>
<P>
   At least the Mets have addressed their stadium issue. They hope
to build a new ball park up the street from Shea Stadium, which
would be leveled. The new ball park would resemble Ebbets Field,
where the Dodgers played in Brooklyn before departing in Walter
O'Malley's covered wagon for Los Angeles after the 1957 season.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was talking about a new
Yankee Stadium on Manhattan's West Side, but maybe he realized it
was not only impractical (at a cost of $1 billion) but also
unnecessary. When last heard, the mayor was touting a football-only
stadium for the Jets in a West Side complex with a new Madison
Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   And for all the talk about a New Jersey stadium being built for
the Yankees, that has been a bluff. No money, no site, no plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees belong in the Bronx, and they belong there in a new
or renovated Yankee Stadium with better access roads. Just as the
Red Sox belong in Boston in a new Fenway Park across the street
from the original Fenway Park. And just as the Mets belong in a
ball park that resembles Ebbets Field.
</P>
<P>
   Charm counts in New York, too. &QL;

 &HT;    Cornyn says he won't sue Morales
 &HT;    By Laylan Copelin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Attorney General John Cornyn said Wednesday he
will not pursue a fraud lawsuit against former Attorney General Dan
Morales, but he is considering filing suit against Houston attorney
Marc Murr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any intention of filing any kind of lawsuit
against Dan Morales,'' Cornyn said. ``I don't know of any evidence
that he benefited personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Cornyn accused Morales of fabricating contracts
to help his friend Murr pursue a claim for $260 million in legal
fees in the state's successful litigation against tobacco
companies. In the face of that accusation, Murr withdrew his claim
against the state. Previously, Murr asked a national arbitration
panel to require tobacco companies to pay his $260 million fee. The
panel awarded him $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn is not backing off his accusation about doctored
contracts. He said he is leaving Morales' fate in the hands of
criminal investigators, while he considers suing Murr to stop him
from collecting the $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the fact that these contracts were doctored, and while
we have defeated his claim for $260 million, he still got $1
million on those same doctored contracts,'' Cornyn said.
</P>
<P>
   Morales has denied any wrongdoing, calling Cornyn a liar and
vowing to clear his name. He said Wednesday that Cornyn's motives
are purely political.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been evident to me from the outset that the objective
of this exercise was to inflict political damage, not to win in
court,'' Morales said. ``What they have been after are newspaper
headlines that they can use if and when I were to re-enter
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Murr, through his attorney, has denied wrongdoing. He could not
be reached for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Austin attorney Roy Minton, who represents Murr, said he was
unaware that Cornyn was considering suing his client. He said he
was puzzled about why the attorney general would sue to stop
payment from tobacco companies to his client.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tobacco industry made it very clear they were not paying
any money (to lawyers) that was going to be in a state treasury,''
Minton said. ``John (Cornyn) may take a different attitude. I'll
wait to see what they say.''
</P>
<P>
   Morales has defended his friend's role, saying Murr was his
personal adviser and helped him as watchdog and co-pilot for the
complex litigation. Morales also hired five private lawyers to bear
the costs of the litigation up front and represent the state
against the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   When Murr lost his bid to collect more than $1 million from
tobacco companies, Cornyn attempted to prevent Murr from claiming
any of the state's $17.3 billion settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, on the steps of the federal courthouse in
Texarkana, where the tobacco litigation has been fought for more
than three years, Cornyn levied his allegation of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Cornyn said there was evidence that Morales
committed ``serious misconduct'' but that his office could deal
only with allegations of civil fraud _ not criminal fraud. He said
he already was cooperating with an FBI investigation into the
matter and also would be turning over evidence to the Travis County
district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, as a matter of practice, does not confirm or deny the
existence of investigations. Travis County District Attorney Ronnie
Earle's office, which has jurisdiction over allegations against
state officials, said last week it would wait to receive a
complaint from Cornyn.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Cornyn indicated he was not filing a criminal
complaint with the district attorney. ``Since the feds are so far
along, we have left it in their hands,'' Cornyn said. ``Certainly,
Ronnie Earle has the authority to request documents. We're just
looking for a signal from them.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve McCleery, who directs the district attorney's Public
Integrity Unit, said: ``This is a change in the attorney general's
position and the first we heard of it. We need to evaluate the
situation before commenting further.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn said Wednesday his goal always had been to stop any claim
for legal fees against the state's $17.3 billion settlement. ``My
goal was never to go after Morales,'' he said.

KNIEVEL READY FOR CANYON MOTORCYCLE JUMP
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Robbie Knievel has things figured just right, he'll briefly
soar with the condors this evening.
</P>
<P>
   The motorcycle daredevil intends to jump a sliver of the Grand
Canyon and perhaps break his world-record leap of 233 feet. An
attempt late last month was canceled by foul weather, but sunshine
is forecast for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Television plans to broadcast the feat live to the East
Coast and, provided all goes well, on tape to the West Coast at 8
p.m. Arizona time. Fox is calling the spectacle the Robbie Knievel
Canyon Jump, instead of Death Jump, its name for the aborted April
29 attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Knievel, 37, got the approval of the Hualapai Nation to attempt
the stunt. It's set for approxi mately 5:45 p.m. at a remote
visitor center and airstrip known as Grand Canyon West, northwest
of Peach Springs on the Canyon's south rim.
</P>
<P>
   Promoters say the leap will take Knievel and his bike up to
2,500 feet above the Canyon floor. The jump itself is more than 200
feet, and Knievel hopes to break his own record. But there's more
to it than that.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he's recognized in many quarters as the greatest
motorcycle dare devil ever, the specter of his father, Evel, whose
spectacular jumps and crushing failures riveted the nation in the
1960s and '70s, still looms over him. If Knievel is able to pull
this off, he may have his place in the sun. &QL;

TV NETWORK RIVALRY MAY BE COSTING GALAXY HISPANIC FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ A battle between rival Spanish language
television networks Univision and Telemundo might be causing the
Galaxy to lose Hispanic fans, team officials claimed.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy, with attendance at the Rose Bowl averaging only
15,456 through five games, signed a local television agreement with
Telemundo earlier this year to broadcast four games.
</P>
<P>
   Univision, the most popular Spanish station nationally and
locally, holds Major League Soccer's national Spanish broadcast
rights. But, because the Galaxy signed with a competitor, Galaxy
director of media relations Luis Garcia feels that Univision
virtually has boycotted the team locally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time they (Univision) came out this season was when
Octavio (Zambrano) was fired and Sigi (Schmid) was hired,'' Garcia
said. ``They used to come out to practices all the time. Their
coverage of us following games is really short also. They don't do
anything more than a Channel 4 (NBC) or a Channel 2 (CBS) would do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't think someone's journalistic integrity would be
taken away because we signed with a competitor,'' Garcia said. ``We
think that their (Univision) audience wants to be informed as to
what's going on with out team. It just hasn't been happening.''
</P>
<P>
   MLS vice president of player relations Ivan Gazidis said the
league is still working on a way for the Galaxy to sign former UCLA
striker Seth George, drafted by the team in the second round of the
1999 college draft.
</P>
<P>
   George is not with the 1860 Munich German club he signed with
after college, but the club still owns his rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``No progress ... Seth is under contract in Europe,'' said
Gazidis. ``We don't propose to pay a transfer fee. Right now we're
waiting for that situation to resolve itself, but we're hopeful.''
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid said if the team's slump continues,
he'll have to change the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy lost 1-0 in a shootout Saturday to Tampa Bay, running
its record to 4-5. The Galaxy has scored a league-low five goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed for myself, the team, the players and for the
fans,'' Schmid said. ``(The fans) want to see goals. It's not for a
lack of trying. We're making improvement but if this goes on
another week we may have to shake-up the apple cart because
obviously something isn't working.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid didn't talk about any tactical changes for Sunday's game
at the Rose Bowl against New England, but he talked about future
changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The starting lineup has stayed constant since I took over, but
we could try a formation change. Maybe go with five midfielders,''
Schmid said. ``I would also look at maybe putting (defender) Steve
Jolley back up front. He's played there before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a panic situation because I feel confident we'll
break out of this -- but again, you have to be ready for change.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid said the problem offensively is penetration and the
Galaxy's lack of size is hurting them up front.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a player comfortable in the penalty box,'' Schmid
said. ``Welton, Cobi (Jones) and Clint (Mathis) are comfortable
running at people. But we need that type of player that wiggles
away from people with his back to the goal.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been rumors that Welton has been pursued by other
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no trades right now but there have been talks,''
Schmid said. ``There have been a few names thrown around but I
can't get specific.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Tampa Bay standout Alejandro Sequira and former Dallas
scorer Mickey Trotman have been invited to train with the team this
week.

JUDGE UPHOLDS POLICY OF SEIZING CARS FROM PEOPLE ARRESTED FOR
DRUNKEN DRIVING 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A state judge on Wednesday upheld New York City's new
policy policy of seizing the cars from people arrested on drunken
driving charges, handing the city its first court victory on a
crackdown that has been criticized by civil libertarians.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by Justice Michael D. Stallman of State Supreme Court
in Manhattan came in response to a class-action lawsuit brought by
the New York Civil Liberties Union on behalf of Pavel Grinberg, a
Staten Island man whose car was confiscated by the police on Feb.
21, the day the policy against driving while intoxicated went into
effect.
</P>
<P>
   In deciding in the city's favor, Stallman said Grinberg ``has
not met his burden of demonstrating that the city DWI forfeiture
policy is unconstitutional, contrary to law or arbitrary and
capricious, either on its face or as applied to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and other city officials applauded the
ruling on Wednesday, saying that the judge had proved wrong all the
critics who publicly criticized the policy as ill-advised and
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to remind everyone that the New York Civil Liberties
Union and other advocates and activists do not determine the
Constitution,'' the mayor said. Noting that the initiative was
being copied elsewhere, such as in Long Island, he added, ``We're
going to save hundreds and maybe ultimately, thousands of lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But vowing that ``the challenges will continue,'' Norman Siegel,
executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said on
Wednesday that his organization planned to appeal the case to the
New York State Court of Appeals. If he loses there, he said, he may
take the case as high as the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to maintain that the government should not be in
the business of seizing people's cars without their requisite legal
authority and even if authorized, it should not do so prior to
trial and conviction,'' he said. ``Moreover, we continue to believe
the Giuliani administration's DWI initiative is unfair and
excessive.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said the judge's ruling was not surprising, noting
that forfeiture was a long-used response _ dating back to the
Middle Ages _ in cases where property is instrumental in the
commission of a crime. Since 1984, federal law has allowed for the
seizure and auction of property suspected of being used in a crime,
whether or not a suspect is arrested. A New York state law allows
the forfeiture of vehicles owned by drivers who repeatedly drive
while intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   The three-month-old forfeiture policy relies on a provision of
the city administrative code that allows for the seizure of
burglary tools, gambling equipment, firearms and other instruments
used in committing a crime. Although the code does not mention
drunken driving, Stallman ruled that the city's initiative
``implements current law and codified procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials said on Wednesday that the seizure policy had
been having its intended effect: deterring people from driving
drunk.
</P>
<P>
   According to Police Department figures, there were 336 drunken
driving accidents resulting in 5 deaths over the three months since
the program was carried out on Feb. 21, compared with 427 accidents
and 7 deaths during the same period in 1998, the police said. Since
Feb. 21, the police have seized 405 cars.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that since the program began, they arrested
1,100 people for being either intoxicated or impaired while
driving, compared with 1,319 such arrests during the same period in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Forfeiture applies only to suspects who can be shown to be
intoxicated, meaning the driver's blood alcohol level is 0.10
percent or higher.

IN SWITCH, DEMOCRATS WON'T ACT ON PATAKI PLAN TO EASE DRUG LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Concerned about appearing soft on crime in the
next election, the Democratic legislative leadership plans to
shelve Gov. George Pataki's proposal to scale back New York's
strict drug laws and appears unwilling to support other such
efforts this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic position marks a significant turnabout in the
Capitol, where the party has for years led the crusade against the
state's Rockefeller-era drug laws, only to be accused of coddling
criminals by Republicans, who had previously blocked attempts to
change the laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, who control the Assembly, said they believed that
any bid to weaken the drug laws, among the most stringent in the
nation, could backfire on Democratic lawmakers from more
conservative districts, mostly upstate and in the suburbs of New
York City, where crime is a potent issue.
</P>
<P>
   The move is part of an overall strategy by Assembly Speaker
Sheldon Silver to solidify the Democratic majority's moderate
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Silver has defied liberal Democrats, many of
whom, like himself, are from New York City, by staking out
conservative positions on issues like crime and welfare, hoping to
defuse political attacks by Republicans. More recently, he brushed
aside the protests of New York City lawmakers and backed the repeal
of a city tax on people who commute to work there.
</P>
<P>
   Silver on Wednesday declined to comment on the drug laws. But
Patricia Lynch, his spokeswoman, said he had no plans to take up
the governor's or any other proposals to overhaul the laws this
year because doing so could place some of his members on the
defensive in the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time, there are no plans by the Assembly leadership to
address the governor's proposal,'' Ms. Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker's stance makes it highly unlikely that any revisions
to the drug laws will occur this year, despite mounting criticism
that the laws have caused New York's prison population to swell
with nonviolent, often first-time, drug offenders who have been
subjected to tough mandatory sentences. The Republicans in the
state Senate had indicated that they would support the governor's
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic reversal has also further alienated many liberals
in the party who viewed the proposal by the governor, a Republican,
as a rare opening to finally enact some changes to the drug laws
after a generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am trying to convince my own house that this is a unique
time,'' said Jeffrion Aubry, a Democratic assemblyman from Queens
who wants to lessen the law's sentencing guidelines. ``But it's an
uphill battle because they're afraid of the perception that they
are being soft on crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The position staked out by the speaker even caught a spokesman
for the governor off guard. ``That's bizarre,'' said the spokesman,
Michael McKeon, when asked for a response. He then chided Democrats
in the Assembly for continually refusing to act on criminal justice
proposals advanced by the governor. ``They're not doing anything on
criminal justice issues, no matter what it is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Silver say that his main criminal justice initiative
for the legislative session is a measure to ban assault weapons and
place safety locks on firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Silver's position on the drug laws has widespread support among
suburban and upstate Democrats who have no great appetite for
scaling them back. Naomi Matusow, a Democratic assemblywoman from
Westchester County, expressed deep misgivings about rushing to
overhaul the laws, given the dangers posed by many drug offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with potentially dangerous situations,'' she
said. ``Throwing out the existing laws seems to me to be very
precipitous.''
</P>
<P>
   The laws, which were adopted in 1973 under Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller, force judges to comply with rigid sentencing
guidelines that require long prison terms, even for relatively
minor drug offenses like possessing a small quantity of narcotics.
For example, a person who is convicted of selling more than two
ounces of cocaine, heroin or other controlled substances _ or
possessing more than four ounces _ must be sentenced to a minimum
of 15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The laws have remained largely in place since their enactment,
despite mounting criticism and repeated attempts, mostly by
Democrats, to revise them. The critics have charged, among other
things, that the laws have clogged the state's prisons with drug
offenders, many of them nonviolent addicts, who might be better
served in treatment programs or other cheaper alternatives to
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Last year alone, 9,063 people were sent to state prison for drug
offenses. That brought the total number of people serving state
prison terms for nonviolent drug crimes to slightly more than
22,000, or roughly a third of the total state prison population of
70,000, according to the Correctional Association of New York, a
prison watchdog group.

FIRST LADY LIKELY TO FORM SENATE COMMITTEE, AIDES SAY
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton has told friends in recent
days that she is likely to form an exploratory committee that would
allow her to raise money and pay bills associated with a Senate
campaign, several associates of the first lady said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion by Mrs. Clinton that she is, in the words of one
adviser, ``inching very close'' toward a critical step in her
decision-making process came as she has faced some criticism for a
flurry of trips to New York that were billed as official White
House business. An exploratory committee would allow her to raise
money to pay for visits that even her own supporters say have taken
a decidedly political cast, as more and more Democrats seem certain
she will run.
</P>
<P>
   ``An exploratory committee is being considered,'' said Marsha
Berry, the first lady's spokeswoman, by telephone on Wednesday
night from the Grand Canyon, where Mrs. Clinton was visiting. ``But
at this point, any talk of an actual announcement is premature.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if she goes ahead with an exploratory committee, several
associates of Mrs. Clinton said, she has still not made a final
decision to run for the Senate. One close adviser said on Wednesday
night that the first lady was still weeks away from making a final
decision even on the exploratory committee, though this adviser
said that such a step appeared increasingly likely.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Mrs. Clinton's remarks to associates are the latest
indication that she is moving toward what would be the
unprecedented step of running for the Senate from the White House.
What is more, the first lady has asked several trusted advisers to
give her the names of political staff and fund-raising experts in
New York who could help raise money for the exploratory committee,
should it be formed, the aides said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Mrs. Clinton has told her closest advisers,
including Harold M. Ickes, the former White House chief of staff,
and several other associates to begin making staff preparations for
a possible campaign for the seat being vacated by Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   ``She at least wants to be able to continue to consider it,''
said one adviser, after speaking to Mrs. Clinton on Monday. ``It's
not the same as making a decision to run.''
</P>
<P>
   Another close associate, who also spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said: ``I think she has concluded that being a senator
is something she wants to do. She is figuring out whether she is
prepared to make a decision that will consume the next 7{ years of
her life.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The prospect of Mrs. Clinton running for the Senate has stirred
great interest among her friends and Democrats, including a number
of political consultants who would like to work for her in a
campaign and who have in recent days been furiously trading
information _ or rumors _ about the first lady's intentions. Mrs.
Clinton is known for keeping her counsel, and thus there were some
discrepancies on Wednesday night in accounts of what she is doing,
even among people who described themselves as familiar with her
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   For example, two associates of Mrs. Clinton said the first lady
had gone so far as to instruct associates to move ahead with
forming an exploratory committee, with the intention of announcing
a decision sometime in June or early July. Two other people who are
close to Mrs. Clinton described those statements as overblown,
saying she in fact has still reserved the possibility of not making
the race in the end.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, pressure on Mrs. Clinton to signal some sort of
intention is growing. For one thing, aides to Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani of New York City, the Republican who is likely to run for
Senate next year, have questioned the trips Mrs. Clinton has made
to New York at taxpayer expense.
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Nita M. Lowey, the Democrat from Westchester County who
has said she would run for the nomination if Mrs. Clinton does not,
is said by other Democrats to becoming increasingly anxious for
Mrs. Clinton to make a decision. If Mrs. Clinton runs, Ms. Lowey is
going to run for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Mrs. Clinton goes ahead and forms an exploratory
committee, she still could back out of the race. As a practical
matter, though, such an announcement would be seen in New York as
approaching a definite decision and would almost certainly lead to
Ms. Lowey exiting the race.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, there is a growing consensus among Democrats in
New York, as well as Mrs. Clinton's friends, that she is going to
run. ``Do I think she wants to run?'' said James Carville, the
Democratic consultant. ``Yes. Do I think the president would like
to see her run? Yes. Do I know yet whether she has decided to do
it? No.''

ON HOCKEY: A FINAL FOUR WITH MANY STORY LINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOE LaPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After Colorado ended Detroit's Stanley Cup reign Tuesday night
in Joe Louis Arena, the teams formed the traditional handshake
lines and the Avalanche's Claude Lemieux extended his hand to the
Red Wings' Darren McCarty. But McCarty snubbed him. Through the
bitter four years of rivalry between their two teams, these two men
have epitomized the hard feelings and have contributed to some of
the bloodshed. McCarty has ignored Lemieux's hand before. Although
this series was not as mean-spirited as those in previous seasons,
McCarty was not in a forgiving mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's personal feelings, between us,'' McCarty told
reporters, cutting off further discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Of his emotions in general and of the feelings of his city,
McCarty said: ``This is Hockeytown and there's no more hockey. I
feel bad about that.''
</P>
<P>
   By losing Game 6 by 5-2, the Wings' cup streak stopped at two.
After winning the first two games of the second-round series, they
lost the next four in a stunning skid. Their problems started in
goal, where Chris Osgood was injured and Bill Ranford was
inconsistent, but the slump spread throughout the roster. The Red
Wings could not solve Colorado goalie Patrick Roy, who got stronger
as the series went on and gave up only seven goals in the last four
games. And Detroit could not stop Peter Forsberg, who scored twice
on Tuesday and now leads all playoff scorers with 17 points on six
goals and 11 assists halfway through the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit captain Steve Yzerman said, ``They got stronger and we
faded,'' and he added, ``Losing is a humbling thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Scotty Bowman, the Detroit coach, said, ``When you lose four
straight games, you can't say the other team was lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowman has been ambiguous on the question of his return or
retirement from coaching at age 65. He has coached various teams to
eight cup championships, tied for the lead with Toe Blake, his
mentor in Montreal in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado, which won the cup in 1996, is the only recent champion
among the final four teams. The Avalanche will play the Stars in
the four-of-seven-game Western Conference finals, beginning
Saturday night in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars won the regular-season championship for the second
consecutive season and eliminated St. Louis in six games in the
second round. For the last three seasons, the Western finals have
produced the eventual cup champion, and that is very likely to be
the case this season. The only other previous cup winner still
around is Toronto, from the Eastern Conference, which last won in
1967, the last spring of the old six-team National Hockey League.
The Maple Leafs, now one of 27 NHL teams, will play the Buffalo
Sabres, beginning in Toronto on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The best chance for the Eastern winner to beat the Western
winner would be for the East series to end in four or five games
while the Western winner gets injuries and fatigue in a long series
of six or seven games. All this will become more clear in two
weeks. In the meantime, the third round should be interesting in
both brackets. Although Buffalo and Toronto are neighbors on
different sides of the international border, they have never played
each other in the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams have stars in goal, the Sabres with Dominik Hasek,
the Leafs with Curtis Joseph. Both have captains who are premier
centers. Toronto's Mats Sundin is primarily an offensive attacker,
while Buffalo's Mike Peca is a two-way center who is considered
among the best checkers in the league. The Sabres reached the third
round last season before losing to Washington. Despite finishing
seventh among the eight Eastern seeded teams, the Sabres are
confident after eliminating Boston in six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we were just happy to get there,'' defenseman Jason
Woolley said, referring to the conference finals. ``This year,
we're not just happy to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't be hard to get there for Game 1. The two cities are
about two hours apart by car. They get each other's television and
radio stations and fans travel to each other's rinks for games.
Toward the end of Tuesday night's 3-2 victory over the Bruins in
Marine Midland Arena, the Buffalo fans were chanting, ``We want the
Leafs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars and the Avalanche have also never met in post-season
play, not even when they were in their former locations of
Minnesota and Quebec. Both typify the league's migration of the
1990s, having left northern hockey cradles for the South and the
West. Curiously, the Stars are 5-0 at home in the playoffs while
the Avalanche is 6-0 on the road. Last season, the Stars reached
the conference finals before losing in six games to the Wings.
</P>
<P>
   On defense, the Stars are led by Derian Hatcher, a big captain
known for heavy hitting in the defensive end. Colorado's best
defenseman is probably Sandis Ozolinsh, a swift playmaker who
pushes the attack in the offensive zone. At forward, Mike Modano of
the Stars is in the prime of his career, but his supporting cast is
older and slower than the front-line personnel of Colorado. In
goal, Roy has more championship credentials than Ed Belfour of the
Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the Avalanche, Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock said:
``They're going to have a lot of confidence from beating Detroit.
They've really got eight or nine world-class players. That's a lot
for one team.''

ALVIN ROCKWELL, 90; LAWYER HELPED MOLD POSTWAR GERMANY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Calif.)   (bl)  
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alvin John Rockwell, a prominent San Francisco lawyer who, as a
government attorney, helped to draft the legal system for a
democratic postwar Germany, died Wednesday in San Francisco, where
he lived. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   In 1945 he was posted to Berlin as legal adviser to Gen. Lucius
Clay and director of the legal division of the military government
in the U.S.-occupied parts of western Germany and Berlin, where he
helped rebuild the legal system as one rooted in both the German
code law and democratic principles.
</P>
<P>
   Working with his French and British counterparts, he helped
shape what is now the legal structure of the Federal Republic of
Germany. He also reached the German public directly in speeches and
on the radio to discuss the distinctions between democratic and
totalitarian systems.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Kalamazoo, Mich., he graduated from DePauw University in
1929 and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. He studied for a year at
the London School of Economics and received a law degree at Harvard
Law School in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   He briefly practiced in Boston before moving to Washington to
serve as a labor lawyer. He worked in the solicitor general's
office, as special counsel to the attorney general and as a trial
examiner and general counsel to the National Labor Relations Board,
for which he successfully argued cases before the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   After his work in Germany, he moved to San Francisco in 1948 to
become a partner in the firm of Brobeck, Phleger &AMP; Harrison. He
specialized in litigation and headed its executive committee in the
1970s; he had been of counsel to the firm since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   He was a lifetime trustee of DePauw and a past trustee of the
San Francisco Law Library.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell's wife, Anna Hayward Rockwell, died in 1983 after 50
years of marriage. He is survived by a son, John S., of New York,
editor of the Arts &AMP; Leisure section of The New York Times; a
sister, Gladys Osborne of Delray Beach, Fla., and a granddaughter.

SPURRED BY SCHOOL SHOOTINGS, NEW JERSEY LEGISLATURE PUSHES ANTI-GUN
BILLS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Amid growing public support for stronger gun
control laws, Republican legislators in New Jersey are moving
quickly on bills to require childproof trigger locks on guns sold
in the state and are considering a bill that would create strict
criminal penalties for parents whose children use their firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Partly in response to the school shootings in Littleton, Colo.,
the Senate Law and Public Safety Committee will hold hearings on
Thursday on seven gun control proposals, including the trigger lock
measure and one that would offer tax exemptions for gun owners who
buy locking gun-storage vaults.
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial measure would require that all guns sold
in New Jersey after 2002 be equipped with so-called smart-gun
technology, which uses a computer chip to prevent anyone but the
owners from firing the gun.
</P>
<P>
   The trigger lock proposal, similar to one approved this week by
the U. S. Senate, has the support of Gov. Christie Whitman and the
legislative leadership and is expected to become law within months.
Whitman sent a letter Wednesday urging senators to support the
measure, saying, ``There is simply no good reason not to require
that all guns sold be accompanied by this popular, affordable and
effective safety device.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats have complained that the federal legislation,
which is awaiting action in the House, is likely to make New
Jersey's trigger-lock plan redundant. Instead, the Democrats want
to concentrate on the smart-gun bill.
</P>
<P>
   In direct response to the Colorado school shootings, a
Republican senator, Louis C. Bassano, is scheduled to introduce the
measure on parental penalties during Thursday's hearing. The bill
would expose parents to criminal prosecution if their children use
their guns and would set harsher penalties if the firearms are used
to commit a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Various gun bills have long been under discussion, but the
events at Littleton have aroused so much public concern that
legislators are ready to act on some of those bills, said Bassano,
who is a member of the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative activity here is part of a wave of gun control
measures being pushed by governors and state legislators across the
nation, from a California bill that would limit handgun purchases
to one a month to a measure introduced by the governor of Delaware
that would require a background check for the sale of any gun, even
between private citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Democratic majority in the Assembly also passed
a parental responsibility bill earlier this month and is pushing
for a ban on assault weapons. But both measures face strong
opposition in the Republican-controlled Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocates say the Littleton shootings have also
helped stopped the momentum of bills in several states where gun
lobbyists have sought weaker rules on concealed weapons and
background checks.

SENATORS SQUABBLE ON GUN CONTROL MEASURES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate bipartisanship that led to Tuesday's
passage of legislation requiring handgun safety locks threatened to
dissolve Wednesday as Republicans and Democrats spent hours in
squabbling about how to tighten a variety of gun control measures.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate put off a vote until Thursday on the most disputed
issue, whether to enact more restrictions against gun show
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear whether the disagreement over several
amendments to be voted on Thursday would result in the collapse of
the overriding $5 billion Juvenile Justice Bill. A vote on the bill
could occur Thursday if party leaders settle their differences.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Republicans joined Democrats in requiring that newly
purchased handguns have safety locks, the two parties were at odds
Wednesday over how to control the unlicensed sale of firearms at
gun shows. The issue was whether a Republican-authored proposal to
require background checks on purchasers at gun shows, approved last
week after the GOP originally rejected a similar proposal, was
filled with new loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   A proposal offered by Senator Frank Lautenberg, Democrat of New
Jersey, was characterized by Democrats as closing a Republican
loophole that allowed certain gun show dealers to sell their wares
without performing background checks on purchasers.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy delivered an impassioned floor speech
in which he accused Republicans of ``making a mockery'' of gun
control by allowing high-volume dealers known as ``special
licensees'' to sell at gun shows without conducting background
checks.
</P>
<P>
   In some of the most incendiary language used in the debate,
Kennedy said it was ``wrong for the Senate to whistle past the
graveyard of Littleton,'' a reference to last month's mass shooting
at Colorado's Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   But Senator Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican, wondered what
all the fuss was about. Sessions said that there is no loophole,
contending that Kennedy was mistaken to think that some dealers
would be exempt from the background check requirement. Moreover,
Sessions said, the proposal offered Wednesday by Democrats would
make practically no difference in combating crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gun stuff is just show,'' Sessions said at a press
conference, charging that Democrats were more concerned about
politics than crime-fighting.
</P>
<P>
   On another issue, Kennedy urged passage of an amendment that
called for retention of a current law that calls on the states to
make an effort to determine why there is a disproportionate number
of incarcerated minorities and to develop intervention strategies.
</P>
<P>
   The Juvenile Justice Bill would change the wording of current
law to replace the reference to ``minorities'' with a phrase that
says states should study why certain ``segments'' of the population
are disproportionately incarcerated. Kennedy, emphasizing that
current law has not resulted in the release of anyone, said the new
language was too vague and would say that ``Congress will look the
other way while minority youths are confined at disproportionately
high rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican, argued against the
measure, saying, ``What's your solution, to let them out of jail,
crack cocaine distributors? Is there an argument that white crack
dealers get away with it because they are smarter or protected?''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday voted 52-48 to table, or kill, the
measure. The Senate also tabled a proposal to add $3 billion to
afterschool programs.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on Wednesday tried but failed to reach a compromise
with Democrats on a proposal to regulate gun sales at pawn shops.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's debate came as the Senate prepared to vote on the
overriding Juvenile Justice Bill, which would pour $5 billion into
fighting juvenile crime. The five-year bill includes $450 million
per year for drug testing and detention centers, $435 million
annually for juvenile crime prevention, $75 million in state
grants, and $40 million for research of juvenile crime programs.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Wednesday, Senator Thomas Harkin, an Iowa Democrat,
threatened to tie up the bill due to his objection to a proposal by
Senator Bill Frist, Republican of Tennessee. Frist proposed ending
what he called a loophole in existing law that allows students with
disabilities to bring a gun to school without being subject to his
state's law that requires a one-year expulsion for anyone bringing
a firearm to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the law stands, local school authorities have to jump
through hoops to remove a dangerous special education student who
brings a gun or bomb to school,'' Frist said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   But Harkin said Frist's amendment would backfire, since it would
expel a student with mental or physical disabilities and provide no
alternative education to a person who may need it the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids with disabilities haven't been shooting anybody,'' Harkin
said, referring to the eight school shootings in the last 39
months.
</P>
<P>
   With Harkin threatening to filibuster the matter, Senate leaders
agreed to put off a vote on the measure until Thursday.

the Stars' locker room this season _ stopping at Derian Hatcher
when the Stars played the Phoenix Coyotes, camping out in front of
Brett Hull when the St. Louis Blues were the opponent, harassing Ed
Belfour when the subject of the Detroit Red Wings arose.

said Keane, who played with the Colorado Avalanche from 1995-97.
``You've got the wrong guy.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the way of the media shuffle, though, and it looks like
Keane will have to live with being a story line for the Western
Conference finals. He won fhe Stanley Cup with the Avalanche in
1996, and his smiling visage hoisting the silver chalise still is
visible on the NHL's ``Cup Crazy'' commercials that
</P>
<P>
   air on television. He's also one of Avalanche goalie Patrick
Roy's good friends. Keane and Roy played together for seven seasons
on the Montreal Canadiens before the two were traded to the
Avalanche in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   And now, Keane will get a chance to beat Roy, one of the hottest
goalies in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ask me how to beat him,'' Keane said, laughing. ``I'm
not a goal scorer.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is a competitor, and Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said he
expects to see Keane have a similar motivation to defeat his old
teammates to that of Brett Hull with the Blues. Like Hull and the
Blues, the Avalanche allowed Keane to walk away a free agent in
1997. Keane signed with the New York Rangers and was later traded
to the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good player for them, and he's a good player for
us,'' Hitchcock said. ``I think there will be \Rsome motivation\S;
he's been a good player when he plays against them. He has some
friends on the other side, but for Keane this is the playoffs and
everything takes a back seat to the war.'' \Nsubheds:Flu bug The
Stars allowed eight players to miss practice yesterday because of
injury, illness or fatigue. Defenseman Shawn Chambers missed while
rehabilitating a knee injury, and Pat Verbeek and Jamie
Langenbrunner rested sore knees. Joe Nieuwendyk, Craig Ludwig,
Richard Matvichuk, Ed Belfour and Grant Marshall also missed
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said some players have flu symptoms,
but he would not say which ones. Nieuwendyk said he definitely had
been hit by the flu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling it right now, but it's getting better,'' he said.
``I expect to be at practice'' today.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers' availability for Saturday's Game 1 is in question, and
Tony Hrkac is out with cracked ribs. Hitchcock said he expects
every other player to be ready. \Nsubheds:Line swap Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock had Brett Hull practicing on a line with Mike Modano and
Jere Lehtinen yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   After moving Hull from line to line for the final three games of
the Western Conference semifinal series with the St. Louis Blues,
Hitchcock said yesterday he expects to start the conference finals
with Hull on the Stars' top line.
</P>
<P>
   Hull dished out the game-winning assist to Modano in Game 6
after rejoining the top line.

FAMILY LAWSUIT SAYS HOSPITAL LOST TRACK OF BODY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By VIVIAN S. TOY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michael McClester disappeared one winter day in 1992
after being taken to a Bronx hospital in an ambulance. Hospital
officials told his family that he had been treated and released, so
they started searching for him.
</P>
<P>
   McClester, 36, had battled drug addiction for years, so his
family looked for him in his old haunts and even made regular
visits to the local police precinct and Police Headquarters to look
at pictures of unidentified dead men.
</P>
<P>
   But eight months after he vanished, McClester's family said they
learned that their worst fears about his fate paled against the
reality of what had happened. Michael McClester had died at Jacobi
Medical Center on Dec. 16, 1992, the day he had arrived, and his
body had been effectively lost through a series of bureaucratic
mix-ups. The city had buried him in a pauper's grave even as his
family hounded police officials to help find him.
</P>
<P>
   The trial of a suit McClester's family filed against the city,
which operates the hospital, seeking $10 million in damages, is
scheduled to begin Thursday in state Supreme Court in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, his relatives spoke to reporters about their painful
search for McClester and the agonizing discovery of how he died
alone and was unceremoniously buried among the city's poor and
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son was respectable,'' said Nancy Moore, McClester's
71-year-old mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not pick up a bum on the street. His dress was
impeccable and his apartment was always neat. In fact, he was
fussier than me. It eats me up that they just threw him like a
piece of garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Moore said she has a recurring dream in which her son cries
out to her, ``Ma, how could they do that?''
</P>
<P>
   Her eyes welled up with tears and she said she wished she could
have seen her son once more before he was buried. ``I could've said
`goodbye,''' she said. ``I could've been a mama.''
</P>
<P>
   The family has since moved McClester's body to a private
cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Lorna Bade Goodman, a spokeswoman for the city's corporation
counsel, declined to comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Moore, a retired special education rehabilitation worker,
said she was in Florida when her son vanished, so she had her older
son, Cedric McClester, led the search. Both she and the elder
McClester said that at first they were not overly alarmed because
Michael McClester had vanished twice before, to enroll in drug
rehabilitation programs.
</P>
<P>
   Cedric McClester, 56, said his brother had started experimenting
with heroin as a teen-ager but had managed to mask his drug
problems for years. He said his brother had been a maintenance
worker at Bronx Lebanon Hospital for several years and also sang
with various bands at local clubs.
</P>
<P>
   He said, however, that his brother had tested positive for HIV
and had gone on disability about a year before his disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Cedric McClester said that on Dec. 16, 1992, police notified the
family that Michael had been admitted to Jacobi _ for treatment of
respiratory problems. He said he called the hospital and was told
repeatedly that his brother had been treated and released.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, Cedric McClester said he went to the
local police precinct repeatedly and looked through piles of
photographs. McClester, a former Democratic district leader from
Harlem, said he also called on friends elsewhere in the Police
Department to help search other hospital and prison files.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on Aug. 31, 1993, a relative received a letter from the
Social Security Administration stating that Michael McClester's
disability benefits would be terminated because he had died on Dec.
16, 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The family later learned that Michael McClester had died in the
hospital's emergency room and that the hospital had sent a telegram
notifying next of kin to a nonexistent address in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   His body was kept in the Bronx morgue for more than a month, but
his picture was never sent to the Police Department's Missing
Persons Bureau. Eventually, the body was released for burial with
others that were unclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an alarmist or one to cry racism, but I believe he was
treated so callously because he was black and because he was HIV
positive,'' Cedric McClester said. ``And it's my feeling that this
kind of negligence hasn't been corrected. This has got to stop.''

 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The 21 victories and 15 losses compiled during Don
Zimmer's tenure as the Yankees' interim manager will be applied to
Joe Torre's career record, said Steve Hirdt, the executive vice
president of the Elias Sports Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is based on ample precedent, and, Hirdt added, ``We
always try to look for reasons to give it to the man who was hired
to be manager.'' The logic is sound, but in this season's first 36
games, the Yankees belonged to Zimmer; they were in his control,
and their collective mood often reflected his, in one of the most
unusual chapters in the Yankees' history.
</P>
<P>
   Torre encouraged Zimmer to be himself, and he was. Zimmer pushed
the successful development of the reliever Jason Grimsley, allowed
Derek Jeter tremendous freedom to blossom as a hitter and propelled
the Yankees to a 20-10 start, even while in tremendous pain from
his right knee. Zimmer also created a couple of avoidable
controversies, and when the team began to slump last week, his
anxious competitiveness _ fueled by his desire to win for Torre,
his close friend _ could not have helped an intense group of
players who needed to relax.
</P>
<P>
   When Torre returned as manager Tuesday afternoon, the Yankees
were in first place in the American League East; even George
Steinbrenner, the principal owner, who engaged in a mild feud of
silence with Zimmer, said it would be hard to ask for anything
more. With Jorge Posada, Chuck Knoblauch and Paul O'Neill _ pivotal
Yankees who struggle to feel good about themselves _ mired in deep
slumps, Torre's comeback is perfectly timed.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer did not want to be a manager again. At 68 years old, he
loved being Torre's bench coach, loved being at the park with
friends, playing bridge with Joe Girardi and O'Neill and Scott
Brosius. His personality played off Torre's perfectly: Torre was
quiet while Zimmer hollered encouragement from the dugout, and you
could barely tell when words passed between them, their lips hardly
moving.
</P>
<P>
   But Torre's prostate cancer was diagnosed and Steinbrenner
almost literally dragged Zimmer _ bad knee and all _ out of his bed
to manage. Zimmer acknowledged immediately that he had taken on a
no-win situation: After going 125-50 in winning the World Series in
1998, the Yankees would begin the 1999 season with two significant
differences, Roger Clemens instead of David Wells, and Zimmer
instead of Torre. If the team lost, Zimmer would be blamed.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, they won, to Zimmer's delight and relief. When they
picked up their first victory of the season April 6, Zimmer's hands
were shaking when he spoke to reporters in a strained voice, and it
was apparent there was great pressure on him. There would have been
pressure on anybody in this situation, and Zimmer was not immune.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees swept Texas and Toronto during a five-game homestand
that ended April 25, improving their record to 12-5, and Torre was
plotting his return. But even through the success, Zimmer's tenure
wasn't seamless.
</P>
<P>
   In the weekend before the regular season began, Zimmer publicly
chastised Steinbrenner for his meddling in the handling of pitcher
Hideki Irabu, which forced the owner to retreat into silence.
Eventually, Steinbrenner's refusal to speak to him gnawed at
Zimmer. On one hand, Zimmer wanted Steinbrenner to let him manage
the team, as Torre had told him to do. On the other hand, Zimmer
wanted Steinbrenner to appreciate the job he was doing.
</P>
<P>
   The plane trips exacerbated the pain in Zimmer's right knee, and
on April 28, the day after a long trip, he and the first-base
coach, Jose Cardenal, engaged in a brief shouting match in the
dugout during a game in Texas. ``You want to manage this team?''
Zimmer yelled, as if Cardenal had challenged his authority.
</P>
<P>
   His emotions simmering, Zimmer decided after that game to call a
team meeting and tell his players that he would retire after the
Yankees' game the next night, that Torre was coming back. He
tearfully thanked them and walked out, leaving a clubhouse of
stunned players to exchange confused glances.
</P>
<P>
   But Zimmer had not discussed his plans with Steinbrenner, or
Torre, or anyone. When he called Torre later that night, he
discovered that Torre wasn't feeling strong and had no intention of
coming back immediately. Many of the Yankees came to believe that
Zimmer had simply reacted to his pain, the frustration over a loss
and his exchange with Cardenal.
</P>
<P>
   Torre and Zimmer met with the news media together before the
Yankees' game April 30, and the change in Zimmer was apparent. With
his friend at his side, Zimmer smiled broadly, he was relaxed and
comfortable, and when someone asked Zimmer a question about Torre,
his voice grew husky and his eyes became watery.

 BOSTON: became watery.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The losing began May 12, against Anaheim, and after the Yankees
were shut out again the following night, Girardi _ one of a handful
of players who had been told by Torre to watch over the team _
called a players-only meeting and began complaining about a lack of
effort, specifically mentioning at least one teammate's failure.
Zimmer walked in to hear this and said the same sort of thing to
Girardi that he had said to Cardenal: You're calling a meeting? Do
think you're managing?
</P>
<P>
   With that, Zimmer broke up Girardi's gathering, even though he
is probably closer to Girardi than to any other player on the team.
(The frustrated feelings did not linger. In a meeting called by
Zimmer the next day, apologies were expressed.) But the Yankees
continued to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer's ability to end the slump was hampered by the Yankees'
poor bench; rather than shake up his lineup or use pinch-hitters
for some of his slump-ridden players, Zimmer was saddled with the
third-string catcher Mike Figga.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Zimmer fought hard to keep Clay Bellinger, a
journeyman utility player whose primary skill _ versatility _ is
much better suited to the National League. Zimmer's son had been
involved in the drafting and signing of Bellinger years ago, and
like his son, Zimmer respected how hard Bellinger played, how he
approached the game, and he wanted Bellinger on this team.
</P>
<P>
   After their fifth straight loss last Saturday, Zimmer yelled
aloud in the clubhouse, angry that a television reporter had
misrepresented what Zimmer had said while asking a question to
Jeter. It was something that Torre never would have done during a
tense time, but then, as Zimmer has said repeatedly: ``I'm not Joe.
I'm going to be myself.''
</P>
<P>
   After Torre returned Tuesday, Zimmer avoided reporters, saying
he didn't want to talk, that he was back to being a bench coach.
Torre decided against thanking Zimmer in front of the players,
knowing Zimmer would break down. The gratitude was inherent anyway,
Torre said. Everybody on the team knew what he had contributed;
everybody knew how much pain he had endured and how loyal he was to
Torre.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went far and above the call of duty,'' pitcher David Cone
said.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer was headed out of the clubhouse before Tuesday's game
when Steinbrenner _ a longtime friend _ walked up and draped an arm
around his shoulder. ``We need you, pal,'' Steinbrenner said, and
Zimmer dropped his head, ducking from his emotions once more. His
task complete, ultimately appreciated, it was as if Zimmer were a
youngster sheepishly looking around for some rocks to kick at,
someone in the clubhouse said.

IN NERVOUS HARTFORD, POLICE CHIEF DENIES HE EXPECTS A RIOT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD _ In a city on edge, even a purchase order can be
provocative.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the Hartford police chief, Joseph F. Croughwell
Jr., acknowledged that his force included some racist officers, he
found himself trying to explain why the department was stocking up
on pepper spray and smoke bombs while residents were waiting
tensely for a prosecutor's decision about whether to charge a white
officer who fatally shot a black teen-ager in the back.
</P>
<P>
   The purchases, Croughwell said in an interview Wednesday, were
routine and not in preparation for unrest over the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   But residents in the bleak North End neighborhood where the
shooting took place are wondering why an armored personnel carrier,
usually kept in a police yard, was sent rolling through the streets
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   And why about 45 officers were given riot training last week.
</P>
<P>
   Those things, too, were just the normal course of business, the
chief said. ``I can see how people would add one and one and get
four,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he said all the preparations were just coincidental,
Croughwell said he was concerned about what could happen after the
prosecutor decided whether the April 13 shooting of Aquan Salmon,
14, was justified. He said he had begun a series of brainstorming
sessions with his commanders about demonstrations that could
follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect a riot,'' he said. ``I really don't. But if we
have one, we have to be prepared for that. This training we're
doing now, it was not developed because of this. It was not
implemented because of this. But it's fortunate that we have it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be people who will try to try to exploit the
decision, either way that it goes,'' he said. ``We could have
incidents. There could be some people who get very angry with
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of the purchases, the armored vehicle and the riot training
swept through the North End Wednesday. ``They're bringing out the
tanks,'' said the Rev. Henry L. Price, a black leader.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents speculated that the information was spread to
intimidate them. Others said they thought the police were trying to
stir things up. ``People on the inside are looking for people in
this community to validate their fear,'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers are unhappy, too. Several said they were frustrated by
the increased scrutiny they have faced since the shooting. They
said that feeling now extended to their off-duty hours, since the
chief, in a news conference on Tuesday, urged white officers not to
attend parties or dinners unless black or Hispanic people were
present.
</P>
<P>
   The officers' bitterness can be seen in a poster promoting a
benefit for Officer Robert Allan, who shot Aquan and said later
that he thought the teen-ager had a gun. ``Shoot? Don't Shoot?''
the poster says. ``Damned If You Do. Dead If You Don't!''

1999 WOMEN'S WORLD CUP: BEAUTIFUL GAME TAKES FLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was so little news media and public interest in the U.S.
victory at the inaugural Women's World Cup of soccer in 1991 in
China that few people even knew the United States had a team, much
less the best team on the planet. The players kept their friends
and relatives informed by sending faxes, which were distributed
like chain letters, the equivalent of technological smoke signals.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one met us at the airport, there were no ticker-tape
parades,'' said the star forward Mia Hamm, laughing. ``One of our
sponsors took an ad out in the papers to let people know we had
won.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, the Women's World Cup is coming to the United
States, from June 19 to July 10, and the 16-team tournament carries
marquee billing as the largest sporting event ever held exclusively
for women. There will be no need to send faxes, or even e-mail,
because all 32 matches will be televised by Disney-owned ABC, ESPN
and ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   The World Cup will serve, in large part, as an affirmation of
the gender-equity gains made since the passage of Title IX, the
1972 federal law that prohibits discrimination in the providing of
athletic opportunities for women. Those gains were most visibly
reflected in the gold-medal success by American women in
basketball, soccer and softball at the 1996 Summer Olympics and the
start up of two professional basketball leagues, one of which has
since folded.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the World Cup will celebrate the explosive growth
of soccer for women in the United States, where 7.5 million female
players are registered, according to a recent survey by the Soccer
Industry Council of America, a trade group. In suburbia, where the
game flourishes, girls' soccer has become as popular as sport
utility vehicles. Hamm is the most recognized and accomplished
player in the country, male or female. She makes commercials with
another University of North Carolina graduate, Michael Jordan, and
she has her own signature Barbie Doll, along with 107 career goals
in international play, 30 more than the Brazilian legend Pele.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets sales have reached 388,000 _ more than three times the
112,000 sold for the 1995 Women's World Cup in Sweden _ and
organizers believe they can eventually put a half-million
spectators in the seats by selling out the 77,716-seat Giants
Stadium for the American and tournament opener and the 92,542-seat
Rose Bowl for the championship game.
</P>
<P>
   The original plan was to play the tournament at small stadiums
on the East Coast. But the American women won the Olympic gold
medal playing before 76,489 spectators at the University of
Georgia, which persuaded organizers to place the Women's World Cup
coast to coast in some of the same cavernous football stadiums that
played host to the men's World Cup in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to show that we're excellent soccer players _ smart,
tactical, fit, fast, athletic _ and we have everything the men's
game has, '' said U.S. forward Tiffeny Milbrett. ``We want
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Soccer's world governing body, known by its initials as FIFA, is
counting on sparks from this World Cup to kindle a brush fire of
interest in women's soccer around the globe, where female players
are facing the same cultural barriers American women faced two
decades ago. There is also hope that the Women's World Cup will
generate a top-flight professional league in the United States in
2001, the way the men's World Cup did, but plans are proceeding
cautiously amid much uncertainty about a league's commercial
viability.
</P>
<P>
   While there is ambitious optimism about the Women's World Cup,
the tournament is not without risk. The success of the World Cup is
largely tied to the success of the American women. Fortunately for
the organizers, the Americans are favored to win with their
wide-open, attacking style, unlike the dreary American men, who
finished dead last in the 32-team 1998 World Cup in France.
</P>
<P>
   But the disparity between the best teams and the rest could
result in some less-than-entertaining mismatches. The Japanese, for
one, played so deferentially in a recent game against the United
States that they were outshot, 35-0, in a 9-0 defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said they did not have the time or money to build the
recognition of stars from other countries. And the scramble for
television viewers has been complicated by the National Basketball
Association lockout, which could extend the NBA finals to June 29.
</P>
<P>
   Should the American women not reach the final, the World Cup is
not very likely to transcend the base of suburban interest _ the
grass-roots soccer community, soccer dads and moms and their
teen-age and preteen girls _ to which the event is being primarily
marketed. An unlikely early exit by the United States could result
in largely empty stadiums and vacant interest by the American
public. But, through clever packaging requirements, organizers have
sold an average of 14,000 tickets for non-U.S. games in the first
round, including 30,000 for a doubleheader in Chicago.

<P>
   ``Capturing the imagination of the American public is something
we'd like to do,'' said Marla Messing, the president of the Women's
World Cup organizing committee. ``Millions are not aware of the
Women's World Cup. To reach out is important. If it is only about
the U.S. team, I wouldn't consider that a success. We're looking
for more balance than that. But we'd be foolish to think the
non-U.S. games will attract as much attention as the U.S. games.''
</P>
<P>
   The competitive side of the tournament would be compromised if
China withdrew in the wake of NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy
in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The fast, technically exquisite Chinese
finished second to the Americans at the 1996 Summer Olympics and
have beaten them twice in the three meetings since late March.
</P>
<P>
   So far, organizers said they had received no indication that
China might pull out; to the contrary, they surmise that the
Chinese could make a stronger political statement by defeating the
United States on its home turf than by withdrawing in protest.
There is some concern, however, about whether the Chinese and the
North Korean teams will have trouble securing visas from the closed
U.S. Embassy in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not say definitely we will come and I did not say we
will not come,'' Zhao Gin Fu, a foreign-affairs official in the
Chinese soccer federation, said from Beijing. ``Up to this point,
there is no such problem that we will not come.''

ONLINE PHARMACY DRUGSTORE.COM FILES FOR IPO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN COOK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Just three months after filling its first
prescription, Bellevue, Wash.-based drugstore.com Inc. has
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission to raise as
much as $67.5 million in an initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   The filing comes in the wake of major changes in the online
pharmacy business. On Monday, CVS Corp., one of the nation's
largest drugstore chains, purchased Seattle-based Soma.com for $30
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This market segment is moving very fast,'' said Gail Bronson,
a senior analyst at IPO Monitor and a startup specialist based in
Palo Alto, Calif. ``So an IPO is absolutely critical (for
drugstore.com).''
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen companies are attempting to crack the online
pharmacy market, from traditional chain drugstores such as
Wal-Mart, Rite Aid and Walgreens to start-ups such as PlanetRX,
RX.com and Express Scripts Inc.'s yourPharmacy.com.
</P>
<P>
   The market for prescription drugs, over-the-counter-drugs,
health and beauty aids and vitamins is estimated to be close to
$230 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Drugstore.com, which sells more than 15,000 health and beauty
products on its Web site, is aware of the competitive threats. ``If
we fail to attract and retain a large customer base and our
competitors establish a more prominent market position relative to
ours, this could inhibit our ability to grow,'' the company wrote
in its filing statement.
</P>
<P>
   Drugstore.com recorded 687,000 unique visitors in the month of
March making it one of the top 50 e-commerce sites, according to
Web site tracking service Media Metrix.
</P>
<P>
   Although competition abounds, drugstore.com's filing for a
public offering gives it a temporary advantage over online
upstarts, Bronson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is an excellent move by drugstore.com,'' she said.
``First-mover advantage is very valuable when you are a dot-com
trying to capture the imaginations of investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Bronson added that the public offering would help drugstore.com
establish its brand name. ``It will help them become equated with
the entire market segment so when anyone thinks of pharmacies or
health and beauty they think of drugstore.com.''
</P>
<P>
   The filing provides the first financial snapshot of
drugstore.com. For the fiscal year ending April 30, the company
recorded a $10.2 million loss on revenue of $652,000. Since the
company was started last summer in the garage of chief executive
Peter Neupert, drugstore.com has lost $17.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company, now with 170 employees, has funded operations
through private financing totaling $57.2 million. Major backers
include Amazon.com, which in February took a 46 percent stake; the
Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP;
Byers, with 28 percent; Paul Allen's Vulcan Ventures, with 9
percent; and Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz's Maveron Equity
Partners, with 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Neupert, who was recruited to lead the company by
drugstore.com founder Jed Smith and Kleiner Perkins, holds 7
percent of the outstanding shares.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Soma.com, which operates its own fulfillment center in
West Chester Ohio, drugstore.com relies on third party vendors to
fill and distribute orders. While this saves the company money on
infrastructure costs, it also could pose a serious threat to
business if the current vendors RxAmerica or Walsh Distribution
cancel their contracts, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   RxAmerica, which supplies about 85 percent of drugstore.com's
prescriptions, is a joint venture operated by Albertson's and Longs
Drugs, both of which are potential competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds from the stock sale will be used for sales and
marketing, possible acquisitions and other general corporate
purposes. The lead manager of the offering is Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter.
</P>
<P>
   Drugstore.com, which plans to trade on the Nasdaq stock exchange
under the ticker symbol DSCM, did not disclose the number of shares
it plans to offer or the date of the stock sale.
</P>
<P>
   The company refused to comment, citing Securities and Exchange
Commission regulations.

 UNDATED: not come.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Globally, women's soccer is most securely positioned in the
United States. But the sport is also well established in the
egalitarian societies of Scandinavia, particularly Norway, the
defending World Cup champion; in China, where sport serves
propaganda purposes and the failure to win the 1991 Women's World
Cup at home caused a temporary shutdown of the women's program; in
Germany, which produced the 1995 Women's World Cup runner-up and
has a professional league, and in Japan, which features the world's
most highly regarded professional league, though several teams have
failed and foreign players have been dropped as a result of the
Asian financial crisis, according to World Cup officials.
</P>
<P>
   In Latin American countries such as Brazil and Mexico, which
have powerful men's teams, the women's teams have qualified for the
World Cup, although they continue to battle stereotypes that
American women once did _ that soccer is a man's game and that
female players are somehow unwomanly.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil holds a national club championship for women and its
women's national team shares with its men's team the powerful
corporate backing of Nike. Support for the Mexican women's national
team, however, is in such infancy that the World Cup squad is
expected to feature seven to nine Mexican-Americans who played
collegiately in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fighting the myths and prejudices that women's soccer
felt in the U.S. in the '70s,'' said Andrea Rodebaugh, the captain
of the Mexican team who played at the University of California at
Berkeley. ``That there are sports for boys and sports for girls and
that soccer is not for girls, not feminine. Now, I think that macho
attitude is dying down.''
</P>
<P>
   Australia, which finished 12th out of 12 teams at the 1995
Women's World Cup, is now providing the national team with an
annual budget of $900,000 with the goal of winning a medal at the
2000 Summer Olympics, which will be held in Sydney. Africa will
field two teams in the World Cup, Nigeria and Ghana. In Nigeria,
interest is sufficient to sustain a magazine called Female
Football. Ghana, which calls its team the Black Queens, so
astonished China with two close matches earlier this year that the
official Chinese news media reported that the Ghanaian players had
gained tremendous fitness by climbing coconut trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have mango trees, too,'' Wolanyo Agrah, the general
secretary of the Ghanaian soccer federation, said with a belly
laugh. ``We ran on the beach for endurance, but that could be a
joke, the coconut trees. The Chinese were amazed at the stamina and
speed of our girls.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the cultural appeal of women's soccer is
as important as its athletic appeal. The Americans are such
pioneers _ missionaries is the word used by coach Tony DiCicco _
for suburban girls that the players' appearances at post-game
autograph sessions bring a shrieking frenzy described by co-captain
Julie Foudy as a ``Beatles concert-slash-slumber party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want these girls to know that they can play at the highest
level,'' said midfielder Kristine Lilly, who is playing in her
third World Cup. ``We didn't look up to on the national team
because there wasn't one. We didn't wait for autographs because
there wasn't anyone to wait for.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Shick, 15, drove with several friends from the Poconos in
Pennsylvania to watch the American women play a recent tuneup match
against China at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., the site
of the tournament-opening doubleheader on June 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather see girls play,'' she said. ``I can relate to the
girls. We can aspire to be like them.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from their skills, the American women said they believed
they held a cultural edge over many teams because women are
expected to succeed in any endeavor in the United States. The
American women are paid an average of $30,000 to $40,000 by the
U.S. Soccer Federation, they have been in a training camp for
nearly six months and most have endorsement deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not second-class citizens like women in some other
countries,'' said goalkeeper Briana Scurry. ``Our personality is,
we go after it. Other teams are aggressive, but there is a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in the Netherlands, which fields one of the world's
best men's teams, the women did not qualify for the World Cup and
are able to practice only two days a week while holding full-time
jobs. Michelle Akers, who will be playing in her third World Cup
for the United States, said she attended a soccer forum in Egypt
several years ago, and that the men seemed uncomfortable when she
played in an otherwise all-male pickup game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked me to play, but I was definitely a freak to them,''
Akers said. ``I almost got into a fistfight. Men were sliding into
me, one guy shoved me. We've come a long way, but we've got a long
way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in the United States, the 1999 Women's World Cup has drawn
nowhere near the financial support that the men's World Cup did in
1994. The organizing committee's overall budget of $28-$30 million
is about one-tenth of the budget for the men's World Cup and the
organizing committee's share of corporate sponsorships is $6
million, compared with the $40-plus million for the men.
</P>
<P>
   ``That World Cup is 80 years old; this one is nine,'' Messing
said. ``A budget of $28 to $30 million for a women's sporting event
is substantial. We are not ashamed of our budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Trecker, the editor of Kick magazine, said he believed
that organizers had made a mistake in portraying the 1999 World Cup
more as a women's event than an international sporting event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very difficult to be convinced at this point that
this is a major world event,'' Trecker said. ``I don't see any
evidence that the world cares.''
</P>
<P>
   If this familiar skepticism and risk place tremendous pressure
on the American players to temper the doubts by winning the World
Cup, it is a situation in which the team has thrived for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said when we started this World Cup, `You can't do it
on a big stage, you can't do it in big stadiums, you won't draw,'''
said Foudy. ``Tell us what we can't do and we'll do it. We love
these types of obstacles. This is the opportunity for us to show
the world our sport and what we've done with it. Women's athletics
needs to know it can put on a big event and be successful. The
hardest part is they don't want to take the risk. We were fortunate
enough that we had great backing to take the risk.'' &QL;

O'NEAL SAYS FINE JUST FINE WITH HIM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ First the Spurs, now the NBA commissioner's
office. Everyone's taken a pound of flesh from Shaquille O'Neal
this week.
</P>
<P>
   The league fined O'Neal $7,500 on Wednesday for his postgame
tirade at official Steve Javie following the Lakers' Game 1 loss
Monday. After four quarters of getting hacked and banged by the
Spurs, O'Neal unleashed on Javie and had to be restrained by Derek
Fisher, coach Kurt Rambis and O'Neal's bodyguard Jerome Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   It was O'Neal's second such outburst in the past week. He chased
down referee Ronnie Nunn after the Lakers' Game 3 loss in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's mouth has cost him plenty this season. In February, the
NBA fined him $10,000 for criticizing officials after a loss at
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   He took this one, which he had anticipated, in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy,'' he said. ``Emotionally, physically, daringly
happy. It's the best thing that's happened to me today so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis didn't seem too concerned over the fine, or O'Neal's
behavior, and in fact credited him with showing great
self-restraint throughout the pummeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he did a phenomenal job of not letting it get to
him. If you look at the entire game, I thought he did a phenomenal
job,'' Rambis said.
</P>
<P>
   And though it took three people to prevent O'Neal from possibly
doing worse (and drawing a suspension), Rambis said it's not a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it bother me? No. Do I want him doing it? No. But what
can I say?''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, O'Neal's crime was ``failing to leave the court in a
timely fashion and verbally abusing the officials.''
</P>
<P>
   Before tipoff, the happy-go-lucky O'Neal was literally singing
happy tunes _ offering a different brand of verbal abuse with a
medley of Rick Springfield (``Jesse's Girl''), George Michael
(``Faith'') and Culture Club (``Karma Chameleon'').
</P>
<P>
   Rooked: With O'Neal getting in foul trouble in both games of
this series, the Lakers are hoping little-used Sean Rooks will make
the most of his minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Rooks played just 8.8 minutes per game this season and played in
36 of 50 games. But with the Lakers battling three 7-footers
they've never been more in need of Rooks' 6-foot-10, 260-pound
frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like what Sean does,'' Rambis said. ``Unfortunately for him
he's a backup center, and on a team with Shaq you're not gonna get
a whole lot of minutes. Anytime that Sean Rooks has gotten
consistent minutes for us, he has always played very, very well....
I have faith in Sean, I know what Sean can do and when Sean plays
the way he's capable of playing, he's a very good player in this
league.''

DRUG CASES AGAINST CONTRERAS BROTHERS FALTER IN MEXICO
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Efforts to prosecute the Amezcua Contreras
brothers, whom American authorities say rank among the world's
largest producers of illegal methamphetamines, appear to be
collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Amezcua, who is 33 and has been imprisoned here for nearly
a year as the United States attempts to extradite him on
trafficking charges, won a victory early Wednesday when Olga
Sanchez Contreras, a federal judge, declared the proceedings
unconstitutional. Mexico's Constitution prohibits the extradition
of Mexican citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Amezcua's lawyer, Everardo Rojas Contreras, said the order
would block further extradition attempts against his client. It was
not clear how long Mexican authorities could continue to hold Jesus
Amezcua after the judge's order.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate case, Jesus Amezcua's younger brother, Adan, who
is 29, was freed from a federal prison Wednesday after an appellate
judge threw out trafficking and other charges against him. Adan
Amezcua had been imprisoned since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Mexico's attorney general declined comment
Wednesday on either case.
</P>
<P>
   The chief of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, Thomas
Constantine, Wednesday called the release of Adan Amezcua ``a
disappointing development.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman said the DEA was still studying the decision in the
Jesus Amezcua extradition case.

COMPANY TO PROCEED WITH SERVICE THAT SEARCHES FEDERAL DATA BASES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Northern Light Technology Inc., whose new fee-based
service for searching federal government data bases fell victim to
a bureaucratic bungle this week, said Wednesday that it would begin
the service with or without the Clinton administration's backing.
</P>
<P>
   The service was designed in a joint venture of Northern Light
and the Commerce Department's National Technical Information
Services to give Internet users an indexing tool for quick
searches.
</P>
<P>
   But just hours after it was disclosed at a news conference on
Monday, senior Commerce Department officials, who said they had
been unaware of the project, announced that they were halting the
fees pending a review of whether it conflicted with the
administration's policy of unrestricted access to government
information.
</P>
<P>
   David Seuss, Northern Light's president and chief executive,
said Wednesday that the company would offer free two-week trials of
the service while administration officials completed a review.
</P>
<P>
   A government spokesman, Morrie Goodman, said, ``We think it's
absolutely fine that they're offering the service for free,'' but
added that if the company instituted fees without administration
approval, ``we will have to rethink our partnership.''

GERMAN CHANCELLOR THREATENS TO VETO LAND WAR BY NATO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 17th graf starting: D'Alema is to meet, etc., to make it U.N.
Security Council resolution, etc.) (rm) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Allied divisions over using ground troops in
Kosovo burst into the open on Wednesday when Germany's chancellor
came to NATO and declared that his country would block the alliance
from fighting a land war.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is first and foremost a German position,'' said the
chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder. ``That position is also the present
position of NATO, and the strategy of an alliance can only be
changed if all the parties involved agree on it. I am against any
change of NATO strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   In blunt, caustic remarks at a news conference, Schroeder
derided Britain's position that the allies should consider a ground
force even without a peace agreement if NATO bombing pounds
Yugoslav troops to the point where they can offer only scattered
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not participate in this specifically British debate on
war theories,'' Schroeder said in response to a question from a BBC
correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   After fending off several similar questions, the chancellor
snapped, ``I have said everything that is to be said on this
particular issue and you will not get any more out of me if you go
on pestering me.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany has long opposed sending its own troops into combat in
Kosovo. But the threat from Schroeder to veto any ground force
without a settlement is new, and he sought to put more weight
behind his words by emphasizing that he was also speaking as
chairman of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's reservations about the course of the war in Serbia
were reflected by a vote on Wednesday in the Italian parliament,
committing the government to seek a halt in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   But though the debate in Rome was long and passionate, the
resolution does not bind Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema to lessen
Italy's longstanding support of NATO policy. Still, D'Alema
welcomed the resolution, and the vote was a clear sign of the
growing domestic opposition to the war that is bedeviling Italy as
well as other European governments that are generally committed to
the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference here, even before he took questions,
Schroeder insulted the United States: He implicitly challenged
Washington's official explanation for the bombing of the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade _ that target analysts relied on a faulty
street map _ by renewing his demand for a formal NATO inquiry into
the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats here say Schroeder, who just returned from China, was
angry that a trip he had long planned to herald his chairmanship of
the European Union was transformed into an official apology for the
embassy bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-member alliance is at a critical crossroads: As time runs
out to prepare hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians to return
to their homes before winter, the allies are badly divided over the
timing and conditions for the use of ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley K. Clark, NATO's military commander, on Wednesday
flew to Washington, where he is expected to brief Defense Secretary
William S. Cohen and Gen. Henry H. Shelton, the chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, on the military options, including both a
peacekeeping force and a land war.
</P>
<P>
   NATO originally envisioned a peacekeeping force of 28,000
soldiers, including 4,000 Americans. The allies' current thinking
is that they will need perhaps 50,000 troops to help police and
rebuild devastated villages in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   No country favors a full-scale invasion against organized
Yugoslav army resistance. But Britain insists that NATO must act
now to prepare for a possible ground attack against battered
Yugoslav troops, an environment military analysts call
semi-permissive.
</P>
<P>
   Greece, however, is urging the allies to suspend bombing for 48
hours as an incentive for President Slobodan Milosevic to
negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution passed by the Italian Parliament on Wednesday
urges a similar suspension, moving a step closer to a unilateral
cease-fire than D'Alema has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema is to meet the NATO secretary general, Javier Solana,
here on Thursday. Italy opposes sending ground troops now but has
left open the possibility of doing so if Belgrade balks at a peace
deal set up by a U.N. Security Council resolution. But the wording
of the Italian resolution was so ambiguous that it did not close
any options for D'Alema.
</P>
<P>
   NATO members are split largely because the United States is
sitting on the fence.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said on Tuesday that ``all options'' remained
open, but on the same day Schroeder contradicted him, saying that
sending in ground troops without a settlement is ``unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO diplomats whom Schroeder addressed in a closed meeting
before the news conference said the chancellor stressed the same
theme of maintaining the air attacks and diplomatic campaigns, but
made his points in more muted tones.

   American diplomats here said Schroeder's remarks were directed
more at his domestic audience than at the international community.
Thus it is unclear whether Germany would carry out its threat to
block a NATO force if the alternative were outright failure.

<P>
   Public opinion in favor of the air war has been slipping in
Germany at the same time that pacific strains in German politics
are resurgent.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party, a junior partner in Schroeder's government, has
become more vocal in opposing the bombing, leading to fears that a
severe split could bring down the fragile coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Milosevic wants to divide NATO. Belgrade's insistence
that it is willing to reach a diplomatic accord only exploits the
allied bickering over the dual-track strategy of diplomacy and war.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats from the seven leading industrial nations and Russia
met in Bonn Wednesday to work out draft language for a United
Nations Security Council resolution. The officials were briefed by
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbot, who had met for two days
with Finnish and Russian leaders in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian envoy, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, on Wednesday flew to
Belgrade, where he demanded a halt in the air strikes and then
immediately went into a meeting with Milosevic. On Thursday, Talbot
and President Martii Ahtisaari of Finland are to meet Chernomyrdin
in Moscow to review the diplomatic approaches.
</P>
<P>
   But the alliance has staked out tough conditions for Milosevic
to meet before the air war ends, leaving NATO with little
negotiating room. One condition, for example, is that Milosevic
withdraw his 40,000 troops from Kosovo before the allies halt the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder said Wednesday, however, that Germany would support a
compromise between that position and the Italian plan to suspend
bombing for 48 hours after a Security Council resolution was
approved.
</P>
<P>
   The allies may also have to sacrifice a possible indictment of
Milosevic for war crimes to negotiate a deal that ensures the
refugees' return before winter. ``That is such a primordial
objective of such primordial importance that all other
considerations fall by the way for a certain amount of time,''
Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters later, NATO's civilian spokesman, Jamie P.
Shea, insisted that the allies remained united in their goals and
opposed to any compromises of their key conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to offer any carrots,'' Shea said.

EDITORIAL: REPRESSION IN PAKISTAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, May 20:
</P>
<P>
   For most of its history, Pakistan has been ruled by military
dictators. In the last 10 years, however, Pakistanis have managed
to break from their authoritarian traditions and enjoy the freedom
of elections and free speech. Now this trend is in peril, with the
arrest this month of a respected and outspoken journalist, Najam
Sethi, by the military's intelligence branch.
</P>
<P>
   Sethi's detention has brought justifiable condemnation from
human rights groups. The government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
says the army has authority to police acts of sedition and that
Sethi had ``suspected links to foreign intelligence agencies.'' But
no evidence has been presented. What appears to have rankled the
government, in fact, is a speech Sethi gave in India recently,
warning of the collapse of institutions in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   According to Amnesty International, Sethi's arrest has been part
of a pattern of intimidation and threats against critics, including
other prominent journalists and opposition spokesmen. Last week,
the chief judge of Pakistan's Supreme Court set up a panel to hear
a challenge to the arrest. Pakistan must urgently review this case,
stop trying to crack down on dissent and make it clear that its
civilian government, not the army, is in charge.

HENRY JONES, 86, FAMILIAR FACE ON SCREEN AND STAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Pa.)   (bl)  
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Henry Jones, a Tony Award-winning character actor who had a long
career on Broadway, in films and on television, died Monday at UCLA
Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was 86 and lived in Santa Monica,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Jones had a face as plain as his name. As his daughter, Jocelyn
Jones Watkins, said Wednesday, ``He looked like the everyday man,
the guy next door.''
</P>
<P>
   He blended into his roles as doctors, ministers, judges,
janitors and sometimes murderers. Often his character was that of a
mild-mannered man with a secret, the worm who turned; frequently
that turn was toward the sinister. Although he was known for being
reliable and highly professional, he could be overlooked, a member
of a supporting cast. But when given the opportunity, he delivered
memorable performances.
</P>
<P>
   Two of his most acclaimed stage appearances were in long-running
Broadway shows in the 1950s. In 1954 he was Leroy, the suspicious
handyman murdered by the psychotic child played by Patty McCormack
in ``The Bad Seed.'' Four years later he won his Tony as featured
actor for his role as Louis Howe, the confidant of Franklin D.
Roosevelt (Ralph Bellamy), in ``Sunrise at Campobello.'' He later
repeated his ``Bad Seed'' role in the film version of that Maxwell
Anderson play, and that led to many offers to play, in his words,
``psychoneurotic janitors.''
</P>
<P>
   On screen, perhaps most significantly, he was the coroner in
Alfred Hitchcock's ``Vertigo.'' In that film he had to deliver a
four-minute monologue that later became celebrated as a cameo. He
was a favorite of Hitchcock, who often cast him on his television
show.
</P>
<P>
   His other films included ``Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?,''
``3:10 to Yuma,'' ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,'' ``The
Grifters'' and ``Dick Tracy.'' Beginning in 1949 he appeared in 350
television shows, including most of the major dramatic anthologies
and series like ``The Defenders,'' ``Quincy M.E.'' and ``Murder,
She Wrote.'' In 1994 he was in Anne Tyler's ``Breathing Lessons''
on Hallmark Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was born in Philadelphia, where he graduated from St.
Joseph's College. In the 1930s he acted at the Hedgerow Theater in
Moylan, Pa., and made his Broadway debut in 1938 in Maurice Evans'
``Hamlet.'' He played Reynaldo and the Second Gravedigger, and by
the end of the run worked his way to the First Gravedigger. He was
also in Evans' production of ``Henry IV, Part Two,'' and in ``The
Time of Your Life'' and ``My Sister Eileen.''
</P>
<P>
   As a private in the Army during World War II, he appeared in
Irving Berlin's ``This Is the Army.'' He also played Humpty Dumpty
and the Mouse in Eva Le Gallienne's ``Alice in Wonderland'' and a
Southern senator in ``Advise and Consent.'' He was in ``The Solid
Gold Cadillac'' and ``They Knew What They Wanted,'' with Paul Muni.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his daughter, of Santa Monica, he is survived by
a son, David, of Arleta, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   As he approached 70, Jones recalled that because of his
unprepossessing appearance he had had a difficult time at the
beginning of his career. ``The casting directors didn't know what
to do with me,'' he said. ``I was never tall enough or good looking
enough to play juvenile leads.'' But Jones seemed satisfied to be a
character actor, and for 60 years he never stopped working.

IDA KLAUS, 94, LABOR LAW PIONEER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ida Klaus, a labor law pioneer who became a
high-ranking New York City official in the 1950s and who wrote the
law that gave city employees the right to bargain collectively,
died May 17 at her home in Manhattan. She was 94.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Klaus was a lifelong labor advocate whose sympathy for the
working classes was instilled in her by her mother. As a young
child growing up in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, she helped
give free food from the family grocery to striking factory workers.
</P>
<P>
   She organized her first union while still in her teens. She was
one of three college women working as a waitress in the summer with
several professional waiters at the Gross &AMP; Baum Hotel in Saratoga
Springs, N.Y. One day, she heard that the hotel planned to lay off
some of the waiters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where I got the nerve, but I said, `Let's get
together and have a meeting,''' she said in a 1974 interview in The
New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Klaus became the spokeswoman for the waiters and waitresses,
and told the hotel management that if anyone was discharged, they
would all go.
</P>
<P>
   ``At which point, Baum said he knew he shouldn't have hired
college girls,'' she recalled. ``But he didn't fire anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Klaus' desire to become a lawyer also derived from the
experience of watching her mother battle the court system for 10
years over her husband's estate.
</P>
<P>
   But after graduating from Hunter College and, in 1925, from the
Teachers Institute of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America,
now the Albert A. List College, she was denied admission to
Columbia University Law School because she was a woman.
</P>
<P>
   She taught Hebrew until 1928, when she was admitted to the law
school with the first class to accept women. She received her law
degree in 1931.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, Ms. Klaus worked as a review lawyer for the
National Labor Relations Board in Washington. In 1948, she took the
post of solicitor for the National Labor Relations Board, a
position that made her the highest-ranking female lawyer in the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, she was hired as counsel to the New York City
Department of Labor under Mayor Robert F. Wagner. She became known
as the author of the so-called Little Wagner Act, the city version
of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, which recognized
workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively through unions
of their choosing. The federal Wagner Act was named for the mayor's
father, Sen. Robert F. Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   She also wrote Mayor Wagner's executive order creating the first
detailed code of labor relations for city employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is one of the pioneers and champions of bringing law and
order into labor relations,'' said Robert Rifkind, a lawyer and a
longtime friend whose father, Simon Rifkind, was a law clerk for
Ms. Klaus. ``She believed labor relations ought not to be under the
rule of tooth and claw.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Klaus briefly worked in the Kennedy administration in 1961
as a consultant for the first labor relations task force for
federal employees.
</P>
<P>
   She returned to New York in 1962 as director of staff relations
for the Board of Education, where she negotiated what was reported
to be the first citywide teachers' contract in the country.
</P>
<P>
   She left in 1975 to become a private arbitrator. In 1980,
President Jimmy Carter appointed her one of the three negotiators
in the Long Island Rail Road strike.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Klaus, who was born on Jan. 8, 1905, received Columbia Law
School's Medal for Excellence in 1996, and an honorary doctorate in
1994 from the Jewish Theological Seminary.

THE CARS MAY STILL FLIP, BUT THE TETHERED TIRES WILL NOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just weeks after three spectators were killed when parts of a
race car were ejected into the stands, the second fatal incident
involving fans in nine months, Championship Auto Racing Teams is
taking steps to make the grandstand a safer place.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with next week's Motorola 300, CART will require its
teams to attach the cars' front wheels and other upright parts
(i.e., brake assemblies and bearings) to the chassis with a
high-strength tether. This ropelike device, which is made of
synthetic fiber, should prevent the wheels from being severed from
the car, thus preventing them from becoming deadly projectiles. The
technology was first applied by Formula One, Europe's premier
racing series, this season.
</P>
<P>
   In both instances where spectators were killed _ the first at
CART's U.S. 500 in Michigan last year and the other at the Indy
Racing League's VisionAire 500 in Charlotte, N.C., earlier this
month _ the carnage was caused by speeding wheels and suspension
parts that had become detached from the cars' chassis during a
crash and were then catapulted into the stands. Three people were
killed and several others injured at each of those races.
</P>
<P>
   ``These tethers are designed to keep the wheel and other
suspension parts captive during high-impact crashes,'' said Kirk
Russell, CART's vice president of competition. ``We've been looking
at wheel retention for many years and we're going to be doing all
four wheels eventually. But right now, parts supply is a problem as
we're doing all this very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell also said that even if the tether does break, the
velocity of the wheel would be reduced, whatever direction it might
fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Indy Racing League, the country's other major open-wheel
racing circuit and CART's rival, is considering similar changes but
has not announced a decision. Several recent reports suggest that
the IRL does in fact plan the use of tethers in the near future,
possibly for next week's Indy 500. There could be an announcement
next Thursday, the final practice before the Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're vigorously studying those possibilities,'' said Ron
Green, an IRL spokesman. ``But not until we're convinced that we've
found a safe solution. When there is, we'll have an announcement.''
</P>
<P>
   It is believed that the IRL is not yet convinced tethers are
safe until further testing is completed. One concern is that the
tethers can become dangerous to the drivers, as they might cause
the wheel to sling-shot into the driver's head if not joined at the
right points.
</P>
<P>
   Russell said that CART has closely followed Formula One's
experience with the tethers and has concluded that the drivers are
not put at greater risk. ``The tethers will be installed so that
they don't allow the wheels to come toward the drivers,'' he said.
There have been incidents in Formula One racing when wheels have
come detached during crashes this season, however, none caused
injury.
</P>
<P>
   CART will adhere to Formula One's rule book, which mandates:
``In order to prevent a wheel becoming separated in the event of
all suspension members connecting it to the car failing, cables
must be fitted which connect each wheel/upright assembly to the
main structure of the car. Under such circumstances, the design of
the cable must be such that no wheel may make contact with the
driver's head. The cable must be flexible with a minimum diameter
of 8 mm.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the tethers, the IRL's biggest promoter, Speedway
Motorsports Inc., announced plans to increase the height of the
catch fences at its tracks, which should provide the fans with more
protection from detached wheels and other flying debris. The
additional fencing, which will be installed at Texas Motor
Speedway, Lowe's Motor Speedway and three SMI owned tracks among
the 11 where the IRL races are held every season.
</P>
<P>
   The move was prompted by the incident earlier this month at
Lowe's Motor Speedway at Charlotte, where three spectators were
killed and eight injured by a disconnected wheel and suspension
parts during a race May 1. The projected cost to increase the
height of the fences is between $1 million and $1.5 million,
according to SMI president H.A. ``Humpy'' Wheeler. The work will
begin at Texas Motor Speedway, the site of the IRL's Longhorn 500
on June 12.
</P>
<P>
   The fences at most of SMI's IRL tracks are currently 15 feet
high with 3-foot-long overhangs along the top. Wheeler said the
fences where spectators are seated will be raised to 21 feet and
topped with 6-foot-long overhangs. Wheeler said that based on the
evidence available to investigators, it would have been unlikely
the wheel could get past the new fence and its arched overhang.
</P>
<P>
   And while slowing the cars _ a CART car can reach speeds of 230
mph _ has been addressed at certain tracks, Russell said that these
changes require major changes. CART is looking at the possibility
but is not ready to consider any drastic changes, Russell said.

REAWAKENING THE ART OF ENSEMBLE IN LONDON  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 23) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Benedict Nightingale is the chief theater critic of The Times of
London.  
 By BENEDICT NIGHTINGALE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Liam Neeson, Juliette Binoche, Kevin Spacey, Nicole
Kidman, Ewan McGregor, Stacey Keach and, right now, Cate Blanchett
as a truculent ex-spy in a revival of David Hare's ``Plenty'': in
the last year or so, the London stage has come to look like a
stalker's den or autograph hound's lair, so marked is the fashion
for embellishing productions with Hollywood faces.
</P>
<P>
   But the odd small voice has been heard, asking what has happened
to the principle of ensemble acting, and that little chorus has
recently been joined by a large voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work can be the star, the company can be the star,''
declared Trevor Nunn, director of the Royal National Theater, in
March. And he has proceeded to prove his point with warmly received
revivals of Shakespeare's ``Troilus and Cressida'' and Leonard
Bernstein's musical version of Voltaire's ``Candide.'' These are
the opening offerings in a special season that by late summer will
consist of six plays, involve some 50 actors and run concurrently
with the other productions at the National.
</P>
<P>
   Is this really such a surprising event? After all, the National
began life 35 years ago with a smallish ensemble led by Laurence
Olivier. His successor, Peter Hall, briefly experimented with
mini-companies presenting mini-seasons organized by Alan Ayckbourn,
Ian McKellen and others.
</P>
<P>
   But under the National's last director, Richard Eyre, casting
was mostly ad hoc, and to a large extent it remains so under Nunn.
The regular program at the theater this summer includes revivals of
Noel Coward's ``Private Lives'' and John Osborne's ``Look Back in
Anger,'' Hanif Kureishi's new ``Sleep With Me,'' and Martin
Sherman's ``Rose,'' a one-woman play with Olympia Dukakis as a
Jewish-American survivor of persecution in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But when Nunn took over the National in 1997, he found himself
nostalgically remembering running the Royal Shakespeare Company in
the late 1960s and early 1970s, when its turnover of actors was far
less rapid than it is now. The idea of a ``democratic, libertarian,
egalitarian company presenting plays of great diversity,'' a
``group of actors working and progressing together, with give and
take,'' still struck him as an ideal.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's a bit early to be talking of pure repertory and
egalitarian ideals, especially since 50 is a large number, company
members can obviously not act together in every play, and nobody
can yet be sure of the permanence of the enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   But Roger Allam, a stunning Ulysses in ``Troilus,'' will also be
seen in ``Money,'' Edward Bulwer-Lytton's play about Victorian
finance, and Gorky's ``Summerfolk.'' Simon Russell Beale, who
brilliantly doubles as Voltaire and Pangloss in ``Candide,'
appears in those plays, too. And those four, along with ``The
Merchant of Venice,'' are being staged by Trevor Nunn, John Caird
or, in the case of ``Candide,'' John Caird ``assisted by Trevor
Nunn.'' Only ``The Darker Face of the Earth,'' by the American poet
Rita Dove, which joins the repertory in July, has a different
director, James Kerr.
</P>
<P>
   Nunn and Caird were the team that brought the world not only
``Les Miserables'' but the RSC's celebrated ``Nicholas Nickleby.''
The imaginative simplicity that won such admiration for their
staging of Dickens marks their current productions, too. In Nunn's
revival of ``Troilus'' in the amphitheater of the Olivier, Greeks
in plumed helmets battle Trojans in Oriental robes on a red-gravel
circle backed by a plain timbered wall.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Candide'' in the same auditorium, the circle has become
black and shiny, and John Napier's decor consists of a series of
oak chests that are used, playroom-style, as boats, horses or
whatever else Voltaire's globe-trotting demands. Though each
production lasts more than three hours, neither can be faulted for
epic size, fluency or pace.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two, ``Candide'' has attracted more attention, mainly
because of its reputation as the masterpiece that began by
flopping, the classic that has always been a work-in-progress. It
would take the combined skills of a 19th-century textual scholar
and a 21st-century computer wizard to work out who contributed what
changes to the show between its Broadway opening in 1956, through
Harold Prince's vaudeville version in 1973 and Jonathan Miller's
1988 production for the Scottish Opera to Caird's current
refashioning of the text.
</P>
<P>
   The National program lists no fewer than six lyricists,
including Lillian Hellman, Dorothy Parker, Richard Wilbur and
Stephen Sondheim, the last two of whom have done extra work for the
National revival. I can't say who rhymed eat, sweet and greet with
spirochete for the song in which Dr. Pangloss justifies his
syphilis as part of God's plan; but I can report that it is
Sondheim who now asks Candide to sing, ``Though of noble birth I'm
not/ I'm delighted with my lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Candide is, of course, the innocent Westphalian whose faith in
Pangloss' philosophic credo, that ``All's for the best in the best
of all possible worlds,'' is tested by witnessing and enduring
evils galore, from the atrocities of war to the Lisbon earthquake.
And the main problem his adventures pose a would-be librettist is
that, as Wilbur once put it, they come in ``a one-joke novel that
goes on for 30 chapters.''
</P>
<P>
   How can you bring narrative coherence, consistency of tone and
dramatic variety to a picaresque satire that presents
disillusioning events galore? How can you accomplish that and keep
faith both with wry, dry Voltaire and with a rich, tuneful score
designed for the great fun house, Broadway?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that you can't, not altogether, and Caird's
production, which does not flinch from embracing sad deaths and
jokey resurrections, the horrors of the Inquisition and the
serenity of Eldorado, might be summed up as
ironical-comical-tragical-pastoral. His contribution to the
``Candide'' archives is to give us extra helpings of Voltaire's
story, Voltaire's arguments with Enlightenment optimism and, for
that matter, Voltaire himself.
</P>
<P>
   It is the constant presence of Russell Beale's formidable
Frenchman, exuding curt, incisive authority and acerbic compassion
as he paces and narrates, that gives the evening its unity and
moral stature.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Russell Beale is matched as a performer only by Russell
Beale. His face, shoulders and body sag, and suddenly he is a
droopily ingratiating Pangloss, earnest and self-important, when he
is arguing that God created noses to keep spectacles in place,
increasingly desperate and panicky as he convinces himself that the
same benign deity ordained his own sickness, torture and execution.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Daniel Evans, his head jerking forward like a fledgling just
emerged from its egg, his vowels equally tentative and nervous, is
a splendidly susceptible Candide. And if Denis Quilley is too
genial for Pangloss' philosophic opposite, the arch-pessimist
Martin, the cast is as consistent as a company needs to be.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the singing is as professional as we now expect from a
theater that recently presented a near-definitive ``Oklahoma!''
Alex Kelly brings wit as well as a fine soprano voice to Candide's
corrupt love, Cunegonde, transforming ``Glitter and Be Gay'' from a
coloratura set piece into a hilarious sendup of avarice and
hypocrisy, in which she sensuously bathes in jewelry while boasting
of ``How bravely I conceal the dreadful shame I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   But though Bernstein's score embraces everything from tango to
martial music to church liturgy, the beat tends too often to become
the upbeat. The contrast between that and the horrors unfurling
onstage sometimes reinforces the evening's ironies; but, myself, I
would have preferred more Kurt Weill and less jaunty Sullivan among
Bernstein's influences.
</P>
<P>
   Only an auto-da-fe, with impassive prelates orchestrating the
chant for blood that rises from a smoky red swirl of jubilant
Spaniards, has the full harshness the original novella invites.
Similarly, it is odd that so faithful an adaptation as this ends
with Bernstein's soaring salute to the joys of building houses,
chopping wood and cultivating gardens, and makes no mention of the
fact that, though Candide's long pursuit of Cunegonde has ended in
marriage, she has become quarrelsome and hateful.
</P>
<P>
   Caird has taken an impressively large step toward giving us both
Bernstein and Voltaire _ but I'm not sure the tortuous history of
``Candide'' has yet reached a definitive close.
</P>
<P>
   Until World War I came to demolish any lingering faith in
chivalry, ``Troilus and Cressida'' was hardly ever seen on European
stages. But now that most people feel equally unromantic about sex
and love, it is hardly ever off them.
</P>
<P>
   Nunn's revival is the fourth I have reviewed in the last three
years, and the sparest and most direct. Nothing but disenchantment
is likely to occur in and outside this desolate Troy and, of
course, nothing does. Peter de Jersey's passionate Troilus is
betrayed by Sophie Okonedo's Cressida, a shallow extrovert who
ventures way out of her emotional depth and morally drowns.
</P>
<P>
   Dhobi Oparei's big, dignified Hector is sneakily slaughtered by
Raymond Coulthard's slick, sneery Achilles. And Nunn's ``Troilus''
ends, as Shakespeare's original didn't, with Cressida alone and
rejected on the battlefield, rouge smeared over her beaten, baffled
face, while gunfire splatters offstage.
</P>
<P>
   This addition to a text that otherwise sticks with swords,
shields and Shakespeare isn't Nunn's main surprise. He has also
cast white actors as the invading Greeks and, although Cressida's
Uncle Pandarus is played in camp, twittering style by a pink-hued
David Bamber, the besieged Trojans are black.
</P>
<P>
   It is tempting to argue with this. Isn't it odd that a British
theater that has often and effectively asked us to blind our
imaginations to actors' color should so emphatically ask us to
notice it? Isn't it doubly strange when Shakespeare emphasizes
that, far from being a racial conflict, the Trojan War was a
harebrained quarrel within the same ethnic family? Yet at least
minority actors are getting opportunities they would not normally
expect, even at the National.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, their response is testimony to the British
theater's skill-in-depth and energy-in-breadth. But there is one
performance that virtually every reviewer has acclaimed, and it
comes from a white Greek. Ulysses seems a limited and limiting
role, partly because the character has a justified reputation for
being cerebral and sly, partly because he delivers the long
speeches that make the play intellectually challenging.
</P>
<P>
   But Roger Allam, uniquely in my experience, suggests that every
wile, every argument, emerges from a deep frustration and anger at
the war's endlessness. He brings heart and stomach to a
traditionally heady part.
</P>
<P>
   Is Allam's redefinition of Ulysses the finest piece of acting
that has recently materialized in London? Maybe. But admirers of
Miranda Richardson in Wallace Shawn's ``Aunt Dan and Lemon'' at the
Almeida and Sheila Gish in Tennessee Williams' ``Suddenly Last
Summer'' at the Comedy might think otherwise. So might fans of Cate
Blanchett, star of the movie ``Elizabeth,'' in Jonathan Kent's
revival of ``Plenty'' at the Albery.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever your feelings about the didactic thrust of a play that
traces the political disillusionment and personal decline of a
woman who finds fulfillment as a British agent in Nazi-occupied
France, you must admit it reinforces Hare's reputation for writing
strong, interesting roles for women.
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Blanchett's Susan Traherne is stronger and more
interesting than either Kate Nelligan in the 1977 premiere or Meryl
Streep in the movie version. She looks like some majestic alabaster
statue, and her despairing husband often finds her chilling to the
touch; but inside the sleek translucence there are fierce, even
feral feelings.
</P>
<P>
   This is a woman who, as she says, ``Likes to lose control,'' a
destructive idealist, a rebel unable to do anything about the
conformism she despises except rage and rave and smash her
possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Blanchett gives us the elegant aloofness and the violence,
plus the odd, humanizing moment of bewilderment and vulnerability.
You can see why others love her. You also know why they fear her.

JUILLIARD TRIES TO NURTURE WELL-TEMPERED ARTISTS  
 FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 23) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ How do you get to Carnegie Hall? Practice hard, for
sure, but take care, too, that your mental and spiritual
development keeps pace with the physical and technical, to produce
a well-rounded individual and artist.
</P>
<P>
   Ouch; the old joke collapses like a souffle. Yet those, more or
less, are the directions the Juilliard School is giving to young
musicians, dancers and actors hoping to find their way to Carnegie
and other prestigious stages. How thoroughly these ideals may have
permeated the cold, angular spaces of the big marble block of a
school at the northern end of Lincoln Center, or the superheated
psyches of artists, whether teachers or students, is debatable, but
such, at least, is the stated policy.
</P>
<P>
   The architect of that policy, Joseph W. Polisi, who has been
president of the school since 1984, seems, in any case, little
given to humor. Charged with responsibility for 730 highly gifted
young artists, Polisi, at 50, earnestly and carefully discusses the
route the institution has traveled of late and where it may be
headed, obviously taking his job seriously indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quiet revolution,'' he called the changes, in response to the
characterizations of Joel Sachs, the contemporary-music specialist
(``permanent revolution''), and Stephen Clapp, who has been the
dean of the school since 1994 (``evolution'').
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the process, the path has not always been smooth, and
several longtime faculty members and administrators were left by
the wayside at various stages. Yet if the school has come to
reflect Polisi's personality at all accurately, it shows a deep
humanity at base, for the hallmark of his tenure has been an
evident concern for the physical, psychological and social
well-being of the students, perhaps best exemplified by
construction of the school's first dormitory, in the 29-story Rose
Building nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted a different feel,'' Polisi said recently. ``I wanted
a place as wonderfully rigorous as it has always been in the values
and standards of the profession, but I also wanted an atmosphere
that was constructive and welcoming, in which it was safe to take
chances and form a very precise focus within a holistic approach.
We have consistently pushed the idea that we want young people to
grow intellectually as well as artistically.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not ever thus. For much of its 94 years, Juilliard, which
just finished its school year after triumphantly announcing ``the
largest capital campaign in the history of performing-arts
conservatories,'' was long the very model of the competitive,
hothouse environment of the old-line conservatory, where students
sought to develop the technical virtuosity that would insure a
great solo career (or so they thought), and cared about little
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter Mennin didn't want a well-rounded student at all,''
Andrea Olmstead said of Polisi's immediate predecessor, who died in
1983. ``He wanted experts.'' Ms. Olmstead, who taught music history
at Juilliard from 1972 to 1980 and now teaches at the Boston
Conservatory, has written ``Juilliard: A History,'' a book
scheduled for publication by the University of Illinois Press this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Polisi would surely deny that Juilliard students' level of
technical expertise has in any way suffered from the heightened
emphasis he has placed on the liberal arts. The offerings are still
not extensive, short of the school's joint-degree program with
Columbia University, nor are the requirements.
</P>
<P>
   And although some teachers of performance feared at the outset
that any such initiatives would encroach on their students'
valuable time for practice and rehearsal, many now point out that
the brightest and most committed young performers are precisely the
ones likely to seek added stimulation in other fields of endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brains, and the use of them in different ways, is not
necessarily an enemy to musical talent,'' said Joel Krosnick, who
teaches cello at the school.
</P>
<P>
   Another powerful argument for change can be found in the
radically altered circumstances of the outside world, which can no
longer be ignored. Although the severity of the crisis facing
classical-music institutions, especially, may in some respects have
been exaggerated, grand isolation is no longer an option.
</P>
<P>
   With music education largely banished from the schools and
potential audience members indulging other demands on their time,
energy and finances, musicians must look to the future not only of
their careers but also of their profession.
</P>
<P>
   Juilliard now offers a course in ``The Business of Music.''
Polisi himself has taught ``American Society and the Arts'' or a
similar course since 1989. Even Dorothy DeLay, the renowned violin
teacher, who has trained any number of celebrated soloists and will
be joined on the faculty next year by her most famous pupil, Itzhak
Perlman, has instituted programs training students to teach others
and to handle their own concert management until they get their
professional feet on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few students will earn enough money as soloists to live
on,'' Miss DeLay said, acknowledging a growing reality that
conservatories have been slow to admit.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Miss DeLay's programs are among several that stand to benefit
from the campaign announced last month to raise $100 million over
five years. Nearly half of the money, $48 million, is intended for
scholarships. Juilliard now has to compete not only with
conservatories _ notably, the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia,
which offers free tuition for all 167 of its students _ but also
with universities offering stipends to performers much the way they
do to athletes.
</P>
<P>
   John Weaver, an organ teacher, cited the case of a promising
student who bypassed Juilliard and accepted an $8,000 stipend to
attend Yale University, Polisi's alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   With $51 million of the campaign already raised at the time of
the announcement, some new programs are already going ahead. For
one, all doctoral candidates, some 20 students, will receive full
scholarships starting in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Another major component of the campaign is $24 million allotted
to improve faculty compensation, which is famously low. ``I don't
know whether you can infer how pathetic salaries are compared to
university scales,'' said Milton Babbitt, who teaches composition
at Juilliard and has taught at Princeton University.
</P>
<P>
   The school appears to be in good financial health, with an
annual budget approaching $44 million set against an endowment of
$435 million. Virtually everyone credits Polisi with being an
excellent provider. Indeed, while some were fearing early on that
Juilliard was turning collegiate, with its rah-rah spirit and
liberal-arts thrust, it seems instead to have been turning
corporate and political, for good or ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe is an excellent politician,'' Sachs said. ``Not that he's
in it for political purposes, but he knows how to use politics to
serve the purposes of a great school.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Ewazen, a composer on the faculty, suggests that given all
the school's disparate divisions, departments, factions and
temperaments, Polisi's job may be the third-hardest in the world,
after the two commonly cited: president of the United States and
mayor of New York. Still, most faculty members seem to feel that
they, like the students, can get his attention when they need it.
Make a good case for a program, many say, and Polisi will soon get
behind it.
</P>
<P>
   That was Sachs' experience when he founded Focus, an annual
festival of contemporary music. (And those who say, as some do,
that Polisi can produce financial backing but not ideas, might note
that by Sachs' account, the two men arrived at the title Focus
independently, on the same morning, seemingly at the same moment.)
</P>
<P>
   Such was also the experience of Daniel Druckman, when he
introduced programs to give the percussion department greater
visibility, and Michael Czajkowski, when he expanded the music
technology program, in which all music undergraduates, using an
array of computers, now try their hands at electronic notation,
synthesis, sampling and recording.
</P>
<P>
   ``This stuff is so pervasive in the music business that we can't
have them leave here ignorant of it,'' Czajkowski said. ``They
don't have to like it, but they have to know about it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the harpsichordist Albert Fuller, who teaches
a course in historical performance, reports that he enountered a
brick wall when he proposed a broader program in early music: ``Joe
Polisi said, `I don't ever get input from the faculty,' so I sent
him a 20-page document. He told me that putting in early music
would be as difficult as turning around an aircraft carrier in the
Panama Canal. In the long run, historical understanding will
triumph, but, boy, it's a tough battle, and I've given up the
battle.''
</P>
<P>
   When such specialized subjects as early music, non-Western music
and jazz are raised, explanations usually fall back on size. They
would involve more students, more classes. And although Fuller
finds that the attitude ``bigger is better'' still prevails at
Juilliard, Polisi has in fact been scaling student enrollment down,
from 950 when he arrived to 730 this year. Pianists and violinists,
especially, have been cut back.
</P>
<P>
   Such actions are responses not only to an increasing awareness
of declining demand and opportunity in a glutted market worldwide
but also to an unhealthy pressure on the building, which was
designed for a mere 450. Still, Polisi says that 730 is a good,
workable number for the future. (The present number comprises 244
graduate students, all in music, and 486 undergraduates: 339 in
music, 79 in dance, 68 in drama.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to do anything that we can't do really well or
that we can't relate to everything else,'' Polisi said recently of
early music and world music. He even added to the heap, pointing
out that Juilliard has never had a choral program, either. But when
it came to jazz, he grew intriguingly evasive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could we talk in three months?'' he asked, going on to report
that he and the trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, who is a Juilliard
faculty and board member in addition to directing Jazz at Lincoln
Center, have given a lot of thought to the matter.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Marsalis, for his part, said, ``There definitely should be a
jazz program, and it's close.'' Given Polisi's concerns about
overcrowding, might there be some connection here to Jazz at
Lincoln Center's future space in Columbus Circle? ``No,'' Marsalis
said. ``Jazz at Lincoln Center will help administer the program,
but it will be at the Juilliard School.''
</P>
<P>
   When Polisi is not lending support to a new initiative, he is
said by many to give the faculty a free hand. ``We have a deal,''
Sachs said. ``I can program anything I want as long as he's allowed
to hate anything he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Polisi was, like his father, a professional bassoonist before
taking administrative positions at the Yale School of Music, the
University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory and the Manhattan
School of Music. The skepticism that greeted his arrival in 1984
undoubtedly stemmed in part from the fact that he was young (36)
and lacked credentials to rival those of composers who preceded
him, Mennin and William Schuman.
</P>
<P>
   A certain skepticism persists in some quarters. ``The change is
not all that great,'' said Babbitt of the Polisi era. ``I'm
enormously fond of Joe personally, but it was the move to Lincoln
Center that really changed attitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet here, too, Polisi played a role. When Juilliard moved to its
new building in Lincoln Center in 1969, it nurtured some
ambivalence. Older faculty members spoke with nostalgia of the
lovable old building farther up Broadway, which now houses the
Manhattan School of Music. In addition, the gloomy entry opened
onto 66th Street, facing discreetly away from Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   Only in 1991, when Polisi had an expansive new entry built above
65th Street, opening onto Lincoln Center Plaza, did the marriage
seem complete. ``It was symbolic,'' said Eve Shapiro, who teaches
in the drama division. ``Suddenly there was light and vitality in
the building, and I feel that about Joseph Polisi's arrival.''
</P>
<P>
   But the pivotal construction project was surely the dormitory,
in 1990, which Polisi carried out in collaboration with Nathan
Leventhal, the president of Lincoln Center. Since all first-year
students are required to live there, and since music, dance and
drama students are mingled within each suite, it instilled a sense
of unity and common purpose to the campus for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   (On other floors, the dormitory houses students from the
American School of Ballet.) Students from the different divisions
became friends and attended one another's performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dormitory is Joseph Polisi's biggest contribution to the
school,'' said Ms. Olmstead, the Juilliard historian. ``It was the
dream of every previous president.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rose building is also home to an array of health services,
mental as well as physical, instituted or greatly expanded by
Polisi. This year, in addition, Don Greene, a sports psychologist,
was hired to conduct classes dealing with performance anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   As a frequent visitor to the school in recent weeks was
constantly reminded, there is more to Juilliard: the evening
division (which this writer attended through much of the 1970s),
the pre-college division, and the Music Advancement Program, for
students in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately the continued reputation of the school rides
primarily on its stars: students like Brian McWhorter, an excellent
trumpeter from Portland, Ore., working on his master's degree, who
seemed ubiquitous over a few recent days: performing part of a
Berio ``Sequenza'' in Sachs' 20th-century performance class,
playing the offstage trumpet in a rehearsal of Beethoven's
``Leonore'' Overture No. 3 with the Juilliard Symphony and
composing electronic music in Edward Bilous' film-scoring class. He
and other students seemed positively to revel in the variety of
pursuits available to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juilliard is more than I had hoped,'' said Masumi Per Rostad,
a violist from New York who won the school's concerto competition
this year and just received his bachelor's degree. ``I've been
having a great time, and it isn't at all like `Nothing but the
Best.'''
</P>
<P>
   The reference was to a gossipy earlier book on the school,
``Nothing but the Best: The Struggle for Perfection at the
Juilliard School,'' by Judith Kogan, from 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juilliard does not care how old its students are,'' Ms. Kogan
writes with typical, mildly amusing overstatement. ``Juilliard does
not care whether they can tie their shoes, crack an egg or boil a
pot of water. Juilliard does not care whether they can screw in a
light bulb, mend a fence or feed a cat. Juilliard does not seem to
care whether they can put an English sentence together either.
Juilliard cares about whether they can do one thing: perform.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, times change, and millenniums can do strange things.

RECORDS SET FOR 11 ARTISTS IN CONTEMPORARY SALE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bidding was fast, furious and often surprising at
Christie's sale of contemporary art Wednesday night. Records were
set for 11 artists, and works often exceeded their high estimates
many times over.
</P>
<P>
   The sale totaled $9.5 million, just above its $9.4 million high
estimate. Of the 46 works offered, 41 sold.
</P>
<P>
   Energy ran high in the crowded Rockefeller Center salesroom as
bids rose. ``There was a totally new spirit in the salesroom last
night,'' said Philippe Segalot, head of Christie's contemporary art
department worldwide. ``The room was filled with many new bidders
and a few new buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   But after the sale, experts said a majority of buyers were
seasoned 20th-century collectors fighting for the chance to buy
works by younger artists. As it has for the last year, the auction
house confined its offerings in the contemporary art sale to works
from the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bidders had to fight. Among the hottest offerings was Robert
Gober's ``Untitled (Leg With Candle),'' a 1991 sculpture of a
section of a leg made from wax, human hair, leather, cotton and
wood. After a long, slow war among several unidentified telephone
bidders, as well as Anthony d'Offay, the London dealer, and Simon
de Pury, a Geneva private dealer, the sculpture eventually sold to
Segalot's telephone bidder, for a staggering $794,500, nearly twice
its high estimate of $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   During the bidding Segalot was seen looking up at a sky box
where Francois Pinault, owner of Christie's, was sitting. Many
people in the audience said after the sale that they could see the
two speaking. The Gober price was a record for the artist, topping
the $552,500 paid at Christie's in November.
</P>
<P>
   Another high price, though not a record, was paid for
Jean-Michel Basquiat's ``Self-Portrait as a Heel, Part 2,'' a 1982
painting depicting the artist with a face like an angry African
mask. Estimated at $400,000 to $600,000, it sold to an unidentified
telephone bidder for $772,500. Another Basquiat, ``Untitled''
(1987), brought a strong price, too: $552,500, right in the middle
of its estimate of $400,000 to $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   One of the evening's biggest casualties, though not
surprisingly, was Robert Ryman's `Signet 20'' (1965-66), an
all-white painting in thick horizontal strokes. Its estimate of
$1.5 million to $2 million was too high, and the work had been at
auction only a few years ago. Nobody was willing to pay more than
$1.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Final prices include the auction house's commission, 15 percent
of the first $50,000 plus 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not
reflect commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Three bidders were determined to buy Andy Warhol's ``Untitled
(Rorschach Series),'' from 1984. The black-and-white painting sold
to an unidentified telephone bidder for $684,500, more than twice
its high estimate of $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Many times collectors ignored estimates and just kept bidding.
For Christopher Wool's ``Untitled (Fool),'' from 1990, in which the
artist used letters as imagery, five bidders engaged in a serious
bidding battle. It finally sold to Thea Westreich, a Manhattan
dealer, for $420,500, seven times its high estimate of $60,000. The
price was a record for the artist.
</P>
<P>
   Another record was set for Richard Serra. ``Sign Board'' (1969),
a thin sheet of hardened lead propped up, was estimated at $100,000
to $150,000. Larry Gagosian, the New York dealer, bought the
sculpture for $431,500.

AUGUSTO PABLO, 46, MUSICIAN; HELPED SHAPE REGGAE'S SOUND
</HEADLINE>
   (nk)

<P>
   Augustus Pablo, a widely influential reggae producer, died on
Tuesday at University Hospital in Kingston, Jamaica. He was 46 and
lived in the hills outside Kingston.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was myasthenia gravis, a nerve disorder, said his
brother, Garth Swaby.
</P>
<P>
   Pablo, whose original name was Horace Swaby, was known for what
he called the ``Far East sound'': haunting, minor-key tunes with
sparse lines for melodica (a harmonica with a keyboard) floating
above deep bass lines and echoing keyboards. He was an architect of
dub reggae, music in which deep bass lines and dizzying echo
effects envelop a few shards of melody.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Kingston in 1953, he became a Rastafarian while still a
teen-ager; he also taught himself to play piano. Bob Marley brought
him into the studio to play keyboards on early Wailers recordings,
and he began working regularly as a session musician in the late
1960s. He joined the house band at Randy's Studio, a leading
Kingston studio.
</P>
<P>
   A friend introduced him to the melodica, and he took it into the
studio when he had his first recording sessions as a leader in 1969
with the producer Herman Chin-Loy. His first single, ``Iggy Iggy,''
was credited to Augustus Pablo, a name Chin-Loy used for
instrumentals. When Adams moved to the United States in 1971, he
left the Pablo name to Swaby.
</P>
<P>
   With his next single, ``East of the River Nile,'' Swaby as
Augustus Pablo inaugurated the Far East sound, and he followed it
with his first major Jamaican hit, ``Java,'' in 1972. While making
solo recordings, often reworkings of past and present hits, he was
also in demand as a studio musician, and he worked for a dozen
leading Jamaican producers in the early '70s. In 1972 he started
running his own labels, including Hot Stuff, Rockers International,
Yard and Message. Pablo produced recordings for singers, notably
Junior Delgado, Jacob Miller and Hugh Mundell, and he released
instrumentals under his own name.
</P>
<P>
   Those instrumentals are cornerstones of modern dub reggae,
particularly those he recorded in the mid-70s, including the albums
``King Tubby Meets Rockers Uptown'' (a 1976 album of Pablo
instrumentals remixed by the engineer and producer King Tubby) and
``East of the River Nile'' from 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Pablo rarely toured; his milieu was the recording studio. He had
hits in Jamaica as Junior Delgado's producer in the mid-80s, and he
continued releasing his own instrumental recordings well into 90s,
adding digital technology to his older style.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his brother, he is survived by his companion,
Karen Scott; a son, Addis; a daughter, Isis; a sister, Claudia
Swaby McBean, and his mother, Buelah Swaby.

JEROME WOLKEN, 82, SCIENTIST WHO GAVE SIGHT TO SOME BLIND
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Pa., Mass., Fla.)  (nk) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON

<P>
   Jerome Jay Wolken, a biophysicist at Carnegie Mellon University
in Pittsburgh who delved into the mysteries of sight and light and
invented a lens system that gave sight to some legally blind
people, died on May 10 at his home in Pittsburgh. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Wolken's Light Concentrating Lens System, developed in the 1980s
and used in eyeglasses, opened new vistas on medical science,
photography, astronomy and the collection of sunlight. One of the
patents for the system involves a pear-shaped lens 10 times more
sensitive to light than a standard camera lens.
</P>
<P>
   The system reproduced the lenses that deep-sea creatures adapted
over millions of years to see objects at depths of up to 1,500 feet
in almost total darkness. The key was a special geometric
relationship between the curvature of the top and the curvature of
the bottom of the lens.
</P>
<P>
   Made of glass or plastic for an eyeglass frame, the system
increased the light-gathering ability of eyes that could not send
enough light to their retinas. It was used primarily by people with
cataracts.
</P>
<P>
   In researching deep-sea optics, Wolken worked with the Marine
Biological Laboratory and the Oceanographic Research Institute at
Woods Hole on Cape Cod, Mass., and with similar institutions in
Miami, Bermuda, the Bahamas, Europe and Japan. He applied his
findings to lenses of enhanced photosensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Jay Wolken was born in Pittsburgh and received a
bachelor's degree in chemistry from the University of Pittsburgh in
1946, after wartime service in the Navy. He received a master's
degree in biological sciences in 1948 and a Ph.D. in biophysics in
1949, both from Pittsburgh, where he taught in the 1950s and was
named a professor of biophysics physiology in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Carnegie Mellon appointed Wolken a professor
and head of the biological sciences department at Morrison Carnegie
College. He wrote nine books in his field, edited two more and
contributed some 120 papers to scientific journals. He retired in
1982, but he continued his work until recently.
</P>
<P>
   Wolken is survived by his wife of 43 years, Tobey Holstein
Wolken; their daughter and son, Johanna Zorn of Chicago and Erik
A., of Chapel Hill, N.C.; a daughter and son by an earlier
marriage, Ann Wolken of Venice, Calif., and Jonathan, of Washington
Depot, Conn., and five grandchildren. His first wife, Dorothy
Mallinger Wolken, died in 1954.
