	CHICAGO (AP) -- Couch potatoes can improve heart and lung fitness  
just as much by doing everyday activities like raking leaves and 
climbing stairs as they would working up a sweat in a gym, 
researchers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The authors of two studies in today's Journal of the American  
Medical Association say their findings are good news for anyone who 
doesn't exercise because they don't have time, don't like heavy 
workouts or can't get to a gym. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of us drive to work, sit at our desks and drive home and  
watch TV,'' said Cynthia Gonzalez, who took part in a study at the 
Cooper Institute of Aerobics Research in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	The study followed 235 men and women, ages 35 to 60, who were  
divided into two groups and monitored over two years. One group 
spent 20 to 60 minutes vigorously exercising -- swimming or biking, 
for example -- up to five days a week. The other incorporated 30 
minutes a day of the so-called ``lifestyle'' exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers found that, at the end of six months, both groups  
had similar -- and significant -- improvements in cholesterol ratios, 
blood pressure and body fat percentages. However, the lifestyle 
group had to exercise three times longer than those at the gym to 
burn the same amount of calories. 
</P>
<P>
	The second study, which followed 40 obese women, had similar  
results. 
</P>
<P>
	The studies are among the first clinical trials to find that  
moderate exercise is beneficial for the one in four Americans who 
spend most of their time sitting and put themselves at greater risk 
for heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is great news for the millions of Americans who are not  
getting enough physical activity,'' Dr. Claude Lenfant, director of 
the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, said in a statement 
applauding the two studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the study, Gonzalez was doing ``zero'' but found ways to  
incorporate 30 minutes of moderate exercise -- mostly walking -- into 
her routine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd walk around the house during TV commercials. I'd park  
farther away at the mall,'' said Gonzalez, a retired AT&AMP;T 
saleswoman from Garland, Texas, who saw a marked improvement in her 
treadmill stamina. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers say people who usually don't exercise are more  
likely to stick to a regimen of doing everyday activities than keep 
up with a daily gym routine. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can all start a program -- and most people do in January.  
And by February, 50 percent of those people have stopped,'' said 
Andrea Dunn, a Cooper Institute researcher and lead author of the 
study. ``If we don't develop approaches that are easier for people 
... we'll continue to have the public health problem that we have 
at the moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A recent study by the Mayo Clinic suggested that merely moving  
around or fidgeting can help people stay trim. But these 
researchers aren't recommending that people stop working out at the 
gym or saying that a lunchtime walk here and a set of stairs there 
will do the trick. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has to be a little more structured than that. It's not just  
haphazardly doing 10 minutes on Monday and 10 minutes on Tuesday,'' 
said Ross Andersen of Johns Hopkins University, who led the study 
of obese women. ``And it has to be done at a purposeful pace.''

	White House: Clinton Won't Testify  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors want the Senate to request  
that President Clinton appear at a deposition for his impeachment 
trial. But the White House says Clinton isn't going to do that, It 
says any witnesses would mean a longer trial. The House managers 
also sought subpoenas to question Monica Lewinsky, presidential 
friend Vernon Jordan and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal.

	Pope Greeted by Clinton in Mo.  
</P>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Pope John Paul II today compared America's old  
battle over slavery to new ones over abortion and euthanasia. 
Visiting St. Louis on his fifth U.S. trip, the Pope said ``America 
faces a similar time of trial.'' At the start of a 30-hour stay in 
St. Louis, following his triumphant five-day trip to Mexico, the 
pope also called upon Americans to ``open wide your hearts'' to 
less fortunate people. The frail 78-year-old pope was greeted by 
President Clinton. ``For 20 years you have lifted our spirits and 
touched our hearts,'' Clinton said.

	After Attack, Saddam Threatens US

<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- As American planes attacked Iraq again,  
President Saddam Hussein threatened today to retaliate against the 
United States, vowing that his people's blood ``will not be shed in 
vain.'' Three U.S. aircraft launched missiles and precision-guided 
bombs at defenses near Mosul, a day after Iraq said errant U.S. 
missiles killed 11 people and injured 59 in and around Basra. In 
Washington, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said President 
Clinton has told the U.S. military to respond more aggressively to 
Iraqi challenges in the ``no-fly'' zones, set up to protect Iraqi 
rebels from Saddam's forces.

	ARMENIA, Colombia (AP) -- A powerful earthquake that destroyed  
nearly two-thirds of all the buildings in this western Colombian 
city has killed at least 1,000 people. Stunned residents in 
Colombia's coffee belt chose to wait out the night around bonfires 
rather than venture back into their crumpled homes following the 
magnitude 6 quake. It was the worst tremor to strike this 
earthquake-prone country in over a century.

	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- King Hussein flew back to the United States  
for urgent medical care today, just three days after returning from 
six months of cancer treatment. He turned over the temporary 
operation of Jordan to his eldest son. Hussein, 63, appeared 
flushed and leaned on a cane as he boarded a royal jet along with 
his American-born wife, Queen Noor, and doctors. He was headed back 
to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., where he had undergone 
treatment for non-Hodgkins lymphoma cancer.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The online auction service eBay Inc. is being  
investigated by the city's fraud-fighting Department of Consumer 
Affairs. The department is looking into whether baseballs 
purportedly signed by Babe Ruth, Roberto Clemente and Christy 
Mathewson are authentic, a source said. The probe raises the 
question of whether eBay, which held 13.6 million auctions in the 
fourth quarter of last year when earnings soared 704 percent, can 
be held accountable for allegedly unscrupulous sellers and how it 
could monitor claims made in each sale.

<TEXT>
<P>
	DOYLESTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- A teen-ager drove his car through two  
sets of glass doors at 80 mph and slammed it into a concrete wall 
in his high school gym in what he told police was an attempt to 
kill himself and a friend early Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Air bags and seat belts allowed them to walk away with minor  
injuries, leading Joseph Jenelle, principal of Central Bucks East 
High School, to question whether it was a prank. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing popped into my mind when I saw this is, they saw  
this on TV or in the movies,'' Jenelle said. 
</P>
<P>
	The unidentified 16-year-old and his friend, John Frederick, 20,  
were taken to a hospital and committed for psychiatric treatment. 
Charges may be filed depending on their evaluations, Buckingham 
Township Police Chief Steven Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were depressed and said they wanted to kill themselves,''  
Daniels said. ``And both had been drinking, but they weren't 
legally drunk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jenelle estimated the cost of the damage at $70,000.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Outfielders John Cangelosi and Darrin Jackson  
agreed to minor league contracts with the Chicago White Sox on 
Tuesday and were invited to spring training as non-roster players. 
</P>
<P>
	Cangelosi, 35, batted .251 with one home run and 10 RBIs in 104

<HEADLINE> Gore To Unveil Immigrant Aid Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore has proposed  
spending millions of federal dollars on programs with plenty of 
California appeal -- education, immigration, technology and crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House plans to seek $1.3 billion over five years to  
restore health and disability benefits and food stamps for legal 
immigrants who lost coverage under the 1996 welfare overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Clinton and I made a solemn promise to this nation  
that we would remove these harmful provisions,'' Gore said Monday. 
``We are following through on that promise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal is expected to be part of the budget Clinton sends  
to Congress on Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president, who has announced he will seek the  
Democratic nomination for president in 2000, came to California in 
hopes of scoring points with Hispanics, who were livid at the 1996 
cuts and have since emerged as a crucial voting bloc. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Clinton's proposal, immigrants who enter the country  
legally will become eligible for Medicaid and Supplemental Security 
Income after five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 law denied the benefits to non-citizens arriving after  
that date. Clinton's plan would allow people who arrived after the 
deadline to be eligible as early as 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration would expand food stamp eligibility to  
certain elderly immigrants. It also would give states the option to 
provide health coverage to legal immigrant children and women who 
entered the country and became pregnant after Aug. 22, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore flew to California on Saturday and began promising more aid  
for an array of other initiatives. They include helping California 
reduce class sizes, dispensing $305 million to victims of crime and 
updating the nation's network of satellites. 
</P>
<P>
	This was Gore's 14th visit since January 1998 to California, a  
crucial state for presidential candidates.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks More for Head Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will seek a $607 million  
increase in Head Start spending to include another 42,000 children 
in the pre-school development program for low-income youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal, announced Tuesday by Vice President Al Gore, will  
be part of the fiscal 2000 budget Clinton will unveil on Feb. 1. If 
enacted, it would increase Head Start spending to $5.3 billion and 
bring the program's national enrollment to 877,000 children. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Clinton administration, Head Start spending has  
increased by 68 percent. Enrollment has increased by more than 
200,000 children, reaching 835,000 kids in fiscal 1999.

<HEADLINE> Poor Countries Unprepared for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most poor countries are unprepared for  
potential Year 2000 computer problems, raising concern they might 
have trouble obtaining food, health care and electricity, the World 
Bank said in a report Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of preparation is most acute in sub-Sahara Africa, but  
countries in Asia, Latin America and the former Soviet Union also 
could be hard hit, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no consensus on how bad the Year 2000 problem will be  
or how much it will cost to fix,'' said Joyce Amenta, the bank's 
leading Y2K specialist. ``What we do know is that most developing 
countries are unprepared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bank officials said that at the World Economic Forum in Davos,  
Switzerland, next Monday, they and U.S. representatives will call 
for increased international cooperation to deal with the problem, 
including money to support a Y2K International Cooperation Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, the World Bank has lent $30 million to Argentina for  
Y2K preparation and approved $29 million for Sri Lanka last week. 
Other loans are under consideration, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-tech threat could occur if computers fail when the date  
changes to 2000 next Jan. 1. Because they were written to recognize 
only the last two digits of a year, such programs could read the 
digits ``00'' as 1900 instead of 2000. The computers could 
malfunction or shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	No one really knows what will happen at the century's end and  
predictions vary wildly, from electrical outages to financial 
instability to civil disorder. Maritime shipping, air 
transportation, oil supplies and other sectors of world trade could 
be disrupted. 
</P>
<P>
	Global estimates for fixing the problem run as high as $600  
billion, according to the Gartner Group, a technology research 
firm, not including potential lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Amenta said a World Bank survey of 139 developing countries  
showed that only 15 percent are taking concrete steps to fix the 
problem, 24 percent were aware of the problem but are not taking 
action and 38 percent have appointed a Y2K coordinator, but this is 
not a measure of readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	``The daily survival faced by developing countries have  
distracted governments from fixing the Y2K problem,'' Ms. Amenta 
said at a news conference. ``To them the problem is seen as a vague 
and distant threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Hugh Sloan, a bank information technology specialist for Africa  
said there was a false impression that the Y2K bug is much more of 
a problem in industrial countries and that the low level of 
automation in developing countries may immunize them against Y2K 
problems 
</P>
<P>
	``But actually, the impact could in fact be greater because the  
developing countries are more dependent on fewer and older 
computing systems and they have many more competing national 
demands for scarce resources,'' Sloan said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Africa, where the World Bank has been holding Y2K  
awareness-raising seminars, Sloan said the problem could disrupt 
extensive regional cooperative efforts such as provision of 
electric power.

<HEADLINE> AMA Editors Support Fired Editor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Editors of The Journal of the American Medical  
Association released an editorial Tuesday supporting their top 
editor, who was fired after publishing an article about sexual 
attitudes that was timed to coincide with President Clinton's 
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining editors of JAMA, its editorial board members and  
editors of the AMA Archives journals signed the editorial 
criticizing AMA executive Vice President E. Ratcliffe Anderson Jr. 
The editorial is to appear in the Feb. 3 issue of the journal. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we acknowledge Dr. Anderson's administrative authority  
to act as he did, we ... strongly disagree with the decision,'' the 
editorial reads. ``Editorial independence is the lifeblood of the 
Journal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson fired Dr. George Lundberg for publishing an article  
based on 1991 survey data by the Kinsey Institute for Research in 
Sex, Gender and Reproduction that found that most of the 599 
college students surveyed did not consider oral-genital contact as 
having ``had sex.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lundberg, who was fired Jan. 15 after 17 years as JAMA editor,  
has also won support from editors at other medical publications. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson released a statement promising to safeguard JAMA's  
``tradition of integrity, independence and responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Richard M. Glass, one of JAMA's interim co-editors, said  
Anderson's statement ``reinforces what he has told us about his 
commitment to editorial independence.''

<HEADLINE> GM Retires Oldsmobile 88 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Fifty years ago, drivers were asked to  
``Make a date with the Rocket 88.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Oldsmobile 88, which featured America's first  
high-compression V-8 engine, quickly became Oldsmobile's best 
seller after its introduction in 1949. A red Rocket 88 paced that 
year's Indianapolis 500; ten years later, a Rocket 88 won the 
inaugural Daytona 500. 
</P>
<P>
	After half a century, however, the Oldsmobile 88 has reached the  
end of its road. General Motors officially retired America's 
longest continuous car brand Tuesday, presenting a shiny black 
model for placement at the R.E. Olds Transportation Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	The 88's highest production year was 1955, when 465,000 models  
rolled off the line. The 1960s saw the car grow longer and wider, 
while the 1980s brought major styling and engineering changes. The 
last V-8 engine was manufactured in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten million 88s were built before the last one rolled off the  
line Jan. 6 at Oakland County's Orion Assembly Center. That car, a 
special 50th anniversary edition with gold trim, joined its 
predecessors Tuesday at the Transportation Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the plant's employees signed their names on the inside of  
the hood. The end of the Olds 88 and the Buick Riviera meant the 
layoff of 1,400 workers at the Orion plant; GM has said the company 
will try to place workers at other plants. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing last September the decision to discontinue  
production, company officials said it was time to turn attention to 
more profitable models. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Jarvis, brand manager of GM's 88, Cutlass and future product  
team, said there are no plans to replace the 88 nameplate in 
Oldsmobile's lineup. The division will concentrate on its Aurora 
and Intrigue brands, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Violetta, a retired engineer who spent 37 years with GM,  
lovingly patted the 88 as it sat in the middle of the museum. 
Violetta owns five Oldsmobiles, including a sedan from 1932. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were very well built,'' Violetta said of the 88. ``They  
would make it to 100,000 miles, back when 100,000 miles was unheard 
of.''

<HEADLINE> `Good Morning America' Ratings Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The rescue bid of Diane Sawyer and Charles  
Gibson at ABC's struggling ``Good Morning America'' has gotten off 
to a solid start. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen Media Research ratings for the duo's first week were 25  
percent higher than the show's average numbers during the last 
three months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Sawyer and Gibson replaced Lisa McRee and Kevin Newman on Jan.  
18. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very pleased and happy with the numbers,'' said Phyllis  
McGrady, the ABC executive in charge of the show. ``It sounds like 
people were tuning in to see them. But what made us feel good is 
that they decided to stick around for the week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Today'' show had an average 6.1 million viewers last  
week and ``Good Morning America'' had 4.1 million. CBS's ``This 
Morning'' had an average of 3 million viewers, Nielsen said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson and Sawyer had 4.2 million viewers on the their first  
day, and the audience declined only slightly the rest of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The audience for ``Good Morning America'' has been declining for  
years and reached what ABC hoped was its nadir during the last week 
of 1998. That week, CBS dropped ABC to third place in the morning 
standings for the first time in more than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Only days later, ABC announced its overhaul. Gibson returned  
after stepping down as host last year and Sawyer joined him. Their 
reign was announced as temporary but indefinite.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors Want To See Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writers    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a surprise move, House prosecutors asked  
the Senate today to ``request the appearance'' of President Clinton 
at a deposition for his impeachment trial. They also sought 
subpoenas to question Monica Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon 
Jordan and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's chief lawyer immediately dismissed the request  
as unnecessary, calling it the product of the House prosecutors' 
``desire, their hope, their prayer that something will come to 
rescue their case.'' Attorney David Kendall also warned that the 
White House will demand extensive time to prepare if witnesses are 
authorized. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors made a motion seeking witnesses at the start of  
the trial today, substantially paring down their demand for live 
testimony before a Senate deeply divided on the issue. The motion 
requested only that the witnesses be questioned at depositions, 
though the prosecutors argued in today's debate that they still 
wanted live testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``The two people who know the most about this are Monica  
Lewinsky and President William Jefferson Clinton,'' Rep. Bill 
McCollum said, opening the prosecutors' arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	``We strongly urge that if you allow us to have witnesses, which  
we believe you should ... call President Clinton here to testify,'' 
McCollum said. ``We think it is exceedingly important that you have 
an opportunity, we have an opportunity for you to examine him and 
these other witnesses to get at the truth of this matter and end 
all the speculation that has revolved around this matter and let 
you draw the proper inferences and conclusions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was in St. Louis to greet Pope John Paul II, the upbeat  
welcome sharing a split screen with the trial on national 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	On the president's behalf, Kendall assailed the prosecutors'  
demand for witnesses, noting they had called none of them during 
the House impeachment inquiry. He also suggested the House manager 
had worked closely with Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and had 
the benefit of Starr's extensive evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The manager's case is in no way, no way harmed by being unable  
to call witnesses at this point,'' Kendall said. If Starr ``could 
have turned up anything that was negative or prejudicial it would 
be in those volumes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was to vote at 1 p.m. EST Wednesday on the witness  
question and a Democratic request to dismiss the case. The Senate's 
Democrats are mostly united in their support to dismiss the case 
and oppose witnesses, but their leader suggested today that the 
chance that wavering Republicans would join Democrats had 
evaporated and he expected party-line votes on both issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think on the vote on dismissal and the vote on witnesses, it  
sounds like the line is going to be drawn,'' said Minority Leader 
Tom Daschle. He dismissed the request for Clinton to testify: 
``That's a red herring. It is not going anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans signaled they expected to have the votes to approve  
witness depositions that would be wrapped up by early next week. 
Senate Majority Trent Lott's spokesman, John Czwartacki, praised 
the prosecutors' witness list as ``narrow, focused and reasonable'' 
and said passage was ``a very good possibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyers would be entitled to attend and ask  
questions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Ms. Lewinsky left her Washington hotel today on her  
way out of town. She had returned over the weekend from California 
to interview with House prosecutors at the order of a federal 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her state of mind is she wants to get out of town and I  
endorse that,'' attorney Plato Cacheris said. ``She and I hope she 
will not have to testify. If she's needed, they issue a proper 
document to get her back here, she will return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the trial resumed, one Democrat was absent. Sen. Barbara  
Mikulski of Maryland was in a Baltimore hospital with the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	In making their arguments, the GOP House prosecutors flashed  
their frustration that the Senate had prevented them from having a 
full slate of witnesses as they could at a normal criminal trial. 
``It's been an ordeal by lawyers rather than a trial by 
witnesses,'' Rep. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas lamented. 
</P>
<P>
	The motion submitted by House prosecutors demanded subpoenas for  
Ms. Lewinsky and the two presidential advisers, but not Clinton. 
Instead, the motion said the prosecutors ``request the appearance 
of William Jefferson Clinton ... at a deposition for the purpose of 
providing testimony related to the impeachment trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, a longtime Clinton confidant and golfing partner, helped  
find Ms. Lewinsky a job around the time she had emerged as a 
subpoenaed figure in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case against 
Clinton. Jordan denies the job search and the lawsuit were 
connected. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal was one of the aides to whom Clinton first denied  
having a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky after the 
controversy erupted. He was later called as a grand jury witness 
and repeated Clinton's denial there, including that the president 
believed the former intern had stalked him. House prosecutors hope 
to show Clinton lied to his aides so they would pass on the false 
information to the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	The House prosecutors also asked permission to introduce three  
pieces of evidence that weren't in the official House impeachment 
record used so far during the trial: 
</P>
<P>
	--An affidavit from Barry Ward, the clerk for U.S. District Judge  
Susan Webber Wright who oversaw the Paula Jones sexual harassment 
lawsuit against the president. Prosecutors said Ward attended 
Clinton's deposition in the Jones case and observed a key moment in 
the testimony in which presidential lawyers contend Clinton was not 
paying attention. Ward testified the president was attentive, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	--An affidavit from T. Wesley Holmes, a lawyer for Mrs. Jones,  
who testified that the Jones lawyers had subpoenaed Oval Office 
secretary Betty Currie as a witness in their case in January 1998, 
around the time Clinton had summoned his secretary to his office 
and gone over his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Clinton has said 
he wasn't tampering with Ms. Currie because he had no reason to 
believe she would be a witness in any proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	--Records of telephone calls between Ms. Lewinsky and the  
president, including a Dec. 6, 1997, call that lasted 56 minutes. 
The call occurred around the time Ms. Lewinsky was emerging as a 
possible witness in the Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	With senators set to begin debate over witnesses, one Republican  
questioned the quality of the prosecution's overall case. ``If it 
were an airtight case ... you'd probably have about 70, 75 senators 
lining up to convict,'' said Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama. ``You 
don't see that.''

<HEADLINE> Author Sarah Delany Dies at 109 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sarah Delany, who teamed with younger sister  
Bessie to write a poignant and popular memoir on growing up black 
from the days of Jim Crow to the civil rights era, has died. She 
was 109. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Delany, known as Sadie, died in her sleep Monday at the  
suburban New York City home she had long shared with her sister, 
said her nephew, Harry Delany. Bessie died in 1995 at the age of 
106. 
</P>
<P>
	The two spry and witty women were celebrated as independent and  
educated, with the gumption and humor to sustain them from the 
early days of the century in their native North Carolina to Harlem 
and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	They wrote ``Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100  
Years'' with journalist Amy Hill Hearth. It was published in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The book, sometimes moving and sometimes playful, sold millions  
and has become a high school and college text as well as a play, 
``Having Our Say,'' which ran on Broadway in 1995 and was nominated 
for three Tony awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best tribute we can pay to Ms. Sadie Delany and Dr. Bessie  
Delany is to honor the memory of what they were,'' said Camille 
Cosby, the wife of actor Bill Cosby and producer of a CBS 
made-for-television movie based on the sisters' book, which is due 
to air in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The sisters documented the iron determination of two black women  
not only to survive but to thrive in white society. In their 20s, 
both women moved to New York and began successful careers -- Sadie 
as a high school teacher, Bessie as a dentist. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never let prejudice stop me from what I wanted to do in this  
life,'' the elder sister told The Associated Press in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, the sisters and Hearth published ``The Delany Sisters'  
Book of Everyday Wisdom,'' which included such tidbits as ``When a 
lady should confess her age'' and ``Why life was slower when trains 
were faster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Delany's advice on marriage: ``Don't get married just  
because he looks pretty. He's got to have good genes and have some 
sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was the oldest sister of 10 children who grew up in Raleigh,  
N.C., where her father, freed from slavery at age 7, became a 
school vice principal and the nation's first elected black 
Episcopal bishop. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sadie is molasses without even trying,'' her sister once said.  
``She can sweet-talk the world, or play dumb, or whatever it takes 
to get by without a fuss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Sadie was molasses, Bessie Delany would say, ``then I am  
vinegar! Sadie is sugar and I'm the spice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Delany sisters lived their entire lives together, the last  
38 years in Mount Vernon. Ms. Delany's last book, ``On My Own at 
107: Reflections on a Life Without Bessie,'' appeared in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``They think that old people haven't got any sense,'' Sadie  
Delany once said. ``You do slow up as you get old. But you 
certainly can be wiser than you were.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Delany is survived by 14 nieces and nephews.

<HEADLINE> Expansion Predators Finding Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The NHL is being embraced in Nashville,  
where fans of the Predators mingle with country music stars, don 
``Fang Fingers'' to taunt opposing players and dance along with a 
live band. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, hockey has arrived in Music City.  
</P>
<P>
	The expansion Predators are drawing better than any other NHL  
market with fewer than 2 million people, and the fans have turned 
Nashville Arena into one of the loudest buildings in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	The team has responded, posting a 12-10-3 mark at home,  
including defeats of the Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings and 
Phoenix Coyotes. They took their first season series last week 
against the Vancouver Canucks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Predators' early success on and off the ice has surprised  
even themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the first half of the season, we've met all expectations  
and probably exceeded a lot,'' coach Barry Trotz said. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager David Poile was even more upbeat.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nashville has become the place to play in the National Hockey  
League,'' he gushed. ``I didn't dream I would be saying this 
halfway through the season. It's been a fantastic experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``We call it home-ice advantage or the seventh player. I think  
we have the seventh player here in Nashville. It's a fantastic 
situation that's developed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When awarded the first of four expansion franchises, Predators  
officials spent as much time answering questions about whether 
Nashville could support an NHL team as they did about the team 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
	The team is averaging 15,713 fans. There have been five sellouts  
and weeknight attendance has climbed now that the pro and college 
football seasons have ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tough building to play in. The fans are great,'' Tampa  
Bay Lightning coach Jacques Demers said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Predators' games, fans get a mix of celebrity and excitement  
more common to Los Angeles or New York. On any night, music stars 
like Vince Gill, Reba McEntire, Deana Carter or Amy Grant can be 
seen rooting for the home team. 
</P>
<P>
	Whenever opponents are penalized, fans taunt them with their  
``Fang Fingers'' set to music from the movie ``Psycho.'' A band 
plays between periods. 
</P>
<P>
	Judging by the cheers, the most popular off-ice entertainment  
has been the videos showing what other sports would be like if they 
were more like Predators' hockey. Among the favorites: a bowler 
checked into another lane by a competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	While many fans still are learning the rules, they are loud.  
Their support has meant a lot to a team whose average age is 26. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, they don't know the history like Canadians, but  
they know the sport and they know the score and they've been 
learning real quick,'' center Greg Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Through December, the Predators were flirting with a .500 mark  
and appeared ready to threaten the 1993-94 Florida Panthers for the 
best season by an expansion team (33-34-17). A two-week slump 
before the All-Star break slowed their momentum, and they have a 
16-25-4 mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Nashville's youth has produced some schizophrenic play. In the  
past two weeks, the Predators were routed 8-1 and 8-0, only to 
bounce back with a shutout victory over Phoenix and a 4-1 defeat of 
Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	They also are the worst team at killing penalties and scoring on  
power plays, though they held the Canucks without a shot on four 
power plays in their final game before the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries have cost the Predators 160 games this season. No. 1  
goalie Mike Dunham finally looks recovered from a strained groin 
that limited him to 21 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Predators still have a shot at the eighth playoff spot in  
the Western Conference, but must learn how to win on the road, 
where they are 4-15-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Poile hasn't ruled out making a move before the trading deadline  
if the Predators remain in the playoff hunt. Defenseman Bob 
Boughner thinks that might not be necessary if the team stays 
healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we can compete with good teams in this league. It's  
just a matter of putting our minds to it and trying to get a 
consistent effort,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Teams Talk Before Big Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- So many reporters, so little news.  
</P>
<P>
	The mouthiest Broncos player talked so much during his appointed  
hour that the humid tropical air around him actually grew thin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Loquacious?'' Shannon Sharpe stopped one interviewer in  
mid-question. ``Does that mean talkative?'' 
</P>
<P>
	As if he didn't know.  
</P>
<P>
	The dancingest Falcons player, meanwhile, declared the `Dirty  
Bird' passe -- even though he refused to take the wraps off his new 
step. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some guy came up to me in a bathroom and asks me to the do the  
`Dirty Bird,'' said Atlanta running back Jamal Anderson, who 
invented the dance craze. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `Whoa, buddy! Get me security.'''  
</P>
<P>
	Funny he should mention that. At some other time, in some other  
place, what happened Tuesday at Pro Player Stadium would be called 
stalking. Instead, the National Football League calls it ``Media 
Day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The annual event involves turning hundreds of sports writers,  
assorted TV personalities and cameramen loose on the Super 
Bowl-contending teams like they were entrees at a postgame buffet. 
Sort of a feeding frenzy with a time limit. 
</P>
<P>
	At 8:45 a.m. Tuesday, the scoreboard clock at Pro Player was set  
to 60 minutes to count down the first interview session with the 
Atlanta Falcons. After a break of 45 minutes, it was reset to give 
equal time to the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	In between, reporters were treated to a real buffet in a stadium  
concourse a few levels up -- probably to discourage any Tyson-like 
snacking when they returned to the playing field. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, it was hard to say who enjoyed the morning less -- the  
predators, the prey or the two dozen former NFL players who used to 
be part of the meal and are now part of the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing emerged as monumentally stupid as the 1988 session, when  
a reporter actually asked Washington's Doug Williams how long he 
had been a black quarterback. Or in 1981, when another reporter, 
overplaying the human-interest angle, asked Oakland's Jim Plunkett 
whether his mother was dead and his father was blind -- or vice 
versa. 
</P>
<P>
	That is not to say, however, that Tuesday was totally devoid of  
silliness. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's Ray Buchanan showed up wearing a black leather,  
silver-studded dog collar he bought for his Rottweiler, named Tyson 
because ``he bites ears.'' The Falcons cornerback picked it up at a 
local pet shop, he explained, and decided to wear it during 
interviews so he would look like the ``7-point underdog'' the 
sports books in Vegas have made Atlanta heading into Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	That explanation, though, didn't satisfy a reporter from Comedy  
Central. 
</P>
<P>
	She looked at Buchanan and asked, ``Are you housebroken?  
</P>
<P>
	This is Atlanta's first trip to the Super Bowl and in terms of  
``Media Day'' savvy, it showed. Throw out Buchanan and Anderson and 
there's not an all-interview team candidate on the squad. The 
Broncos, on the other hand, are bursting with them. 
</P>
<P>
	Take Sharpe on whether he would engage in a war of words with  
Falcons safety Eugene Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't want to get into jawing with me,'' Sharpe said.  
``He can't win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And so naturally, when another reporter pointed out that  
Robinson was a Colgate graduate who might be more skilled at 
talking smack than Sharpe suspected, he was ready for that one, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't go to Harvard,'' Sharpe said, ``but I can count to a  
million.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fortunately, he didn't. But Sharpe removed any doubts about his  
math skills a few minutes later. Asked how he thought the rooting 
interest would break down come Sunday's kickoff, Sharpe replied: 
``We've got 17,500 tickets and they've got 17,500 tickets. That 
leaves 40,000 for the locals and such. And most of them will be so 
drunk by then they won't care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Occupying the podium to Sharpe's right was Rod Smith, another  
Denver receiver who unabashedly admits that he models every move -- 
off the field as well as on -- after Sharpe. No one had the nerve to 
ask why. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shannon is known worldwide,'' Smith said. ``And he's got some  
good plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we talk about retirement, he says the plan is to do  
nothing. And the way my accountant set it up, if I can just stay in 
this game for 30 more months at my current pay level, I'm set.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Someone pointed out that three years down the road, the  
28-year-old Smith might find retirement boring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unh-uh,'' he said, ``I'm really a regular guy. I just have a  
famous job.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Drug Charge Vs Cuban Exile in Miam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A Cuban exile already charged with plotting to kill  
Fidel Castro was arrested on new charges of cocaine smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
	Juan Bautista Marquez was arrested last week on a seven-count  
indictment accusing him of importing 803 pounds of cocaine, 
conspiracy to import up to 4,400 pounds of cocaine and money 
laundering, Drug Enforcement Administration spokeswoman Pam Brown 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Marquez, 61, and six other exiles were charged with plotting to  
kill the Cuban president after the U.S. Coast Guard in Puerto Rico 
found two sniper rifles hidden in a Miami-registered yacht in 
October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug arrest is not linked to this case, but DEA wiretaps  
that led to the drug charges against Marquez also intercepted his 
talks with Castro-plot defendants, The Miami Herald quoted 
unidentified officials as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Also arrested by the DEA-led Southeast Florida Regional Task  
Force were Marquez's son, Juan Alberto, 26; Robert A. Alfaro, 27; 
Sergio R. Sigler; and Arturo L. Abascal, all from Miami-Dade 
County. Six others are to be indicted in the same case later this 
week.

<HEADLINE>  Russians Compete With Each Other </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Maria Butyrskaya began defense of  
her European title today with the women's qualifying at the 
European Figure Skating Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	For Butyrskaya and her Russian teammates Julia Soldatova and  
Victoria Volchkova, however, the real competition may have been 
back in Moscow at the beginning of January. 
</P>
<P>
	There, six top women vied for the three spots for the European  
team. 
</P>
<P>
	The competition was so tight that two-time European champion and  
the current world silver medalist, Irina Slutskaya, didn't make the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither did Yelena Sokolova, who won two Grand Prix events last  
fall, nor world junior champion Daria Timochenko, who completed six 
triple jumps at the Russian nationals but came in sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Any of the Russian women can be leading the qualifying groups at  
the end of the day. The qualifications count for 20 percent of the 
score this year, with Friday's short program and Saturday's free 
program counting the remainder. 
</P>
<P>
	The pairs title will be decided today with Russians Yelena  
Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze leading. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of dominating the pairs and ice dance in the former  
Soviet Union days, the individual skaters are now in the forefront. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian men have won three of the last four titles in that event  
while the Russian women have won the last three European titles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian men went 1-2-3 last year and are in a position to do  
it again. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexei Urmanov, Yevgeny Plushenko and Alexei Yagudin are so  
close that Thursday's free skating will decide who takes the 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	For Urmanov, it would be especially satisfying. Injuries wiped  
out last season and a chance to defend his 1994 Olympic crown and 
1997 European title. 
</P>
<P>
	Urmanov -- at 25, older and more experienced than his rivals --  
was more polished in his classical routine to a Bach Toccata and 
Fugue. 
</P>
<P>
	He grabbed the crowd from the start with crisp skating, secure  
landings and -- above all -- the easy grace that made him Olympic 
champion. Not for a beat did he lose the crowd or music -- hitting 
the required double axel on a musical crescendo. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Urmanov knows there is still one more skate to do.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everything starts today,'' he said. ``The competition really  
begins the day after tomorrow'' with the free program. 
</P>
<P>
	But getting through the free program will be a victory of sorts.  
</P>
<P>
	At the 1997 world championships, he led entering the free  
program before withdrawing with a groin injury that kept him out of 
competition for nearly 16 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagudin, the world and European champion, admitted feeling the  
pressure of defending the title. It showed disastrously during 
Monday's qualifying when he crashed on his first jump. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he came back to receive a 6.0 for his entertaining circus  
routine. However combined with his third from qualifying, he is 
third overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Frenchman Laurent Tobel, who surprised by taking one qualifying  
group over Yagudin, dropped to eighth overall after falling on his 
opening jump. 
</P>
<P>
	World champions Angelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov went into  
first after the compulsory section of the ice dance. 
</P>
<P>
	Krylova and Ovsiannikov took the compulsory section comprised of  
the Ravensburger Waltz and Tagno Romantica. They were rated first 
unanimously by the panel, which included judges from Canada and the 
United States, scoring marks mostly in the 5.7 to 5.8 range. 
</P>
<P>
	Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat of France were second,  
although the American judge gave a second on his card to the other 
Russian couple, Irina Lobacheva and Ilia Averbach, third overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Anissina once skated with Averbach for the former Soviet Union  
and won two junior world championships with him before moving to 
France. 
</P>
<P>
	The original dance to the waltz rhythm follows on Thursday with  
the free dance on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Duke Sells Game to Jacksonville </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Duke went ahead with a plan Tuesday to  
move its 1999 home football game against Florida State to 
Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams will meet Oct. 2 at Alltel Stadium, the home of the  
Gator Bowl, the annual Florida-Georgia game and the Jacksonville 
Jaguars. Jacksonville is about three hours away from Florida 
State's home in Tallahassee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils are expected to make about $1 million for  
selling their home game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know as a former college football player that there is  
nothing like the thrill of playing in a pro stadium,'' said Duke 
athletic director Joe Alleva. ``This game will allow our kids to 
experience that next year. The game is also good for the ACC in 
expanding our presence in the state of Florida and in solidifying 
our recruiting base in the Jacksonville area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke earned $1 million to play its 1995 game against the  
Seminoles in Orlando. Afterward, former Duke coach Fred Goldsmith 
said the Blue Devils would never move another home game. 
</P>
<P>
	But two months ago Goldsmith was fired, replaced by former  
Florida assistant Carl Franks. He and Alleva quickly began 
considering another move. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an area that loves great college football and one that  
I'm quite familiar with,'' Franks said. ``I'm excited about this 
opportunity and certainly encouraged our athletic director to 
schedule this game in an important area for our alumni and fans,'' 
Franks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Home of Florida State's second-largest alumni club, Jacksonville  
has been trying for years to bring the Seminoles to the 73,000-seat 
Alltel Stadium. Their last appearance was in 1989, when they lost 
30-26 to a Southern Mississippi team led by Brett Favre.

<HEADLINE> Coast Guard Recommend Mayday Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Coast Guard investigators recommended  
Tuesday that all mayday calls be considered legitimate until 
thoroughly checked. 
</P>
<P>
	The recommendation follows a 1997 sinking of a sailboat that  
claimed four lives. A radio distress call from the stricken vessel 
and a subsequent report of voices in the water did not prompt a 
Coast Guard search. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's report from investigators looking into the sinking of  
the 34-foot Morning Dew released came a week before the National 
Transportation Safety Board holds hearings into the wreck. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the report, Commandant James Loy has ordered a review  
of U.S. Coast Guard rules on responding to distress calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The NTSB is also looking into the whether the Coast Guard  
botched the handling of a distress call from the clamming boat 
Adriatic, which went down off Barnegat, N.J., last week. The 
crewman are presumed dead. 
</P>
<P>
	In that case, the Coast Guard said the mayday message was  
unintelligible and did not contain enough information to launch a 
search. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard receives many false distress calls from  
mariners. But the report recommended the agency consider all mayday 
broadcasts legitimate until proven otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not what happened when the Morning Dew sank on a  
Charleston Harbor jetty on Dec. 29, 1997, killing Michael Wayne 
Cornett, 49, his sons Paul, 16, and Daniel, 14, and nephew Bobby 
Lee Hurd, 14 
</P>
<P>
	The vessel went down in rough weather.  
</P>
<P>
	The Morning Dew radioed a brief distress message at 2:17 a.m.  
The Coast Guard tried three times to radio back but got no 
response. No search was launched because there was not enough 
information about the vessel's location. 
</P>
<P>
	About four hours later, a crewman on a passing ship reported  
calls for help from the water. A harbor pilot boat searched, but 
the Coast Guard did not. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer on watch who received the radio message said he did  
not hear the word ``mayday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard got involved when the wreck was seen on the  
jetty after daylight. 
</P>
<P>
	The report recommended ``search planners must engage in  
aggressive detective work'' if they can't tell where a signal is 
coming from. 
</P>
<P>
	An urgent broadcast should be made to all vessels, not just a  
callback to the vessel that radioed. And officers must replay the 
tape of the distress call, something not immediately done in the 
Morning Dew case. 
</P>
<P>
	If a message is thought to be fraudulent, the tape must be  
replayed for a superior officer and then the district command 
center. If all agree the call is false, no other action is 
required, the report recommended.

<HEADLINE> Everyday Activity Found Good As Gym </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Couch potatoes can improve their heart and lung  
fitness just as much by doing everyday activities like raking 
leaves and climbing stairs as they would working up a sweat in a 
gym, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	The authors of two studies, published in Wednesday's Journal of  
the American Medical Association, say their findings are good news 
for anyone who doesn't exercise because they don't have time, don't 
like heavy workouts or can't get to a gym. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of us drive to work, sit at our desks and drive home and  
watch TV,'' said Cynthia Gonzalez, who took part in a study at the 
Cooper Institute of Aerobics Research in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas study followed 235 men and women, ages 35 to 60, who  
were divided into two groups and monitored over two years. One 
group spent 20 to 60 minutes vigorously exercising -- swimming or 
biking, for example -- up to five days a week. The other 
incorporated 30 minutes a day of the so-called ``lifestyle'' 
exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers found that, at the end of six months, both groups  
had similar -- and significant -- improvements in cholesterol ratios, 
blood pressure and body fat percentages. However, the lifestyle 
group had to exercise three times longer than those at the gym to 
burn the same amount of calories. 
</P>
<P>
	The second study, which followed 40 obese women, had similar  
results. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the study, Gonzalez was doing ``zero'' but found ways to  
incorporate 30 minutes of moderate exercise -- mostly walking -- into 
her routine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd walk around the house during TV commercials. I'd park  
farther away at the mall,'' said Gonzalez, a retired AT&AMP;T 
saleswoman from Garland, Texas, who saw a marked improvement in her 
treadmill stamina. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers say people who usually don't exercise are more  
likely to stick to a regimen of doing everyday activities than keep 
up with a daily gym routine. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can all start a program -- and most people do in January.  
And by February, 50 percent of those people have stopped,'' said 
Andrea Dunn, a Cooper Institute researcher and lead author of the 
study. ``If we don't develop approaches that are easier for people 
... we'll continue to have the public health problem that we have 
at the moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The studies are among the first clinical trials to find that  
moderate exercise is beneficial for the one in four Americans who 
spend most of their time sitting and put themselves at greater risk 
for heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is great news for the millions of Americans who are not  
getting enough physical activity,'' Dr. Claude Lenfant, director of 
the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, said in a statement 
applauding the two studies. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent study by the Mayo Clinic suggested that merely moving  
around or fidgeting can help people stay trim. But these 
researchers aren't recommending that people stop working out at the 
gym or saying that a lunchtime walk here and a set of stairs there 
will do the trick. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has to be a little more structured than that. It's not just  
haphazardly doing 10 minutes on Monday and 10 minutes on Tuesday,'' 
said Ross Andersen of Johns Hopkins University, who led the study 
of obese women. ``And it has to be done at a purposeful pace.''

<HEADLINE> Flyers Kick Daigle Off Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- It's been a terrible year for Philadelphia  
Flyers forward Alexander Daigle. 
</P>
<P>
	First, actress Pamela Anderson-Lee broke up with him. Now, the  
former No. 1 draft pick has essentially been kicked off the team 
after nixing a trade that would have sent him to Edmonton for 
Andrei Kovalenko. 
</P>
<P>
	Flyers general manager Bob Clarke dealt Daigle to the Oilers  
during the All-Star break, but the trade was contingent on the 
seldom-used center signing a $1 million, one-year contract with the 
Oilers. Daigle refused. 
</P>
<P>
	``He asked to be traded,'' Clarke said Tuesday night before the  
Flyers' game against Florida. ``He wanted out of here, so we're 
going to try to accommodate him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can use our trainers and stuff. He can use the facilities.  
But there's no point in hanging around with the team. He's not part 
of the team anymore. He made that decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daigle's agent, Craig Levin, told The Canadian Press that the  
23-year-old center wants to play for the Oilers, but he doesn't 
want to burn an option year in the process. Daigle makes $1.9 
million this season, and the Flyers would have to pay him at least 
that amount next year to retain him. 
</P>
<P>
	``His decision wasn't no against the trade, but instead no  
against the option,'' Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daigle was the No. 1 pick in the 1993 NHL entry draft by Ottawa,  
but hasn't lived up to expectations. He has three goals and two 
assists in 31 games this season, his second in Philadelphia. He was 
traded to the Flyers last season for Vaclav Prospal, Pat Falloon 
and a second-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked earlier this season if he planned to trade Daigle,  
Clarke asked, ``Who would want him?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daigle's best season came in 1996-97, when he had 26 goals and  
25 assists for Ottawa. His agent said he'd prefer to play in Los 
Angeles or Anaheim.

<HEADLINE>  Russians Compete With Each Other </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Maria Butyrskaya began defense of  
her European title today with the women's qualifying at the 
European Figure Skating Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	For Butyrskaya and her Russian teammates Julia Soldatova and  
Victoria Volchkova, however, the real competition may have been 
back in Moscow at the beginning of January. 
</P>
<P>
	There, six top women vied for the three spots for the European  
team. 
</P>
<P>
	The competition was so tight that two-time European champion and  
the current world silver medalist, Irina Slutskaya, didn't make the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither did Yelena Sokolova, who won two Grand Prix events last  
fall, nor world junior champion Daria Timochenko, who completed six 
triple jumps at the Russian nationals but came in sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Any of the Russian women can be leading the qualifying groups at  
the end of the day. The qualifications count for 20 percent of the 
score this year, with Friday's short program and Saturday's free 
program counting the remainder. 
</P>
<P>
	The pairs title will be decided today with Russians Yelena  
Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze leading. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of dominating the pairs and ice dance in the former  
Soviet Union days, the individual skaters are now in the forefront. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian men have won three of the last four titles in that event  
while the Russian women have won the last three European titles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian men went 1-2-3 last year and are in a position to do  
it again. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexei Urmanov, Yevgeny Plushenko and Alexei Yagudin are so  
close that Thursday's free skating will decide who takes the 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	For Urmanov, it would be especially satisfying. Injuries wiped  
out last season and a chance to defend his 1994 Olympic crown and 
1997 European title. 
</P>
<P>
	Urmanov -- at 25, older and more experienced than his rivals --  
was more polished in his classical routine to a Bach Toccata and 
Fugue. 
</P>
<P>
	He grabbed the crowd from the start with crisp skating, secure  
landings and -- above all -- the easy grace that made him Olympic 
champion. Not for a beat did he lose the crowd or music -- hitting 
the required double axel on a musical crescendo. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Urmanov knows there is still one more skate to do.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everything starts today,'' he said. ``The competition really  
begins the day after tomorrow'' with the free program. 
</P>
<P>
	But getting through the free program will be a victory of sorts.  
</P>
<P>
	At the 1997 world championships, he led entering the free  
program before withdrawing with a groin injury that kept him out of 
competition for nearly 16 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagudin, the world and European champion, admitted feeling the  
pressure of defending the title. It showed disastrously during 
Monday's qualifying when he crashed on his first jump. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he came back to receive a 6.0 for his entertaining circus  
routine. However combined with his third from qualifying, he is 
third overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Frenchman Laurent Tobel, who surprised by taking one qualifying  
group over Yagudin, dropped to eighth overall after falling on his 
opening jump. 
</P>
<P>
	World champions Angelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov went into  
first after the compulsory section of the ice dance. 
</P>
<P>
	Krylova and Ovsiannikov took the compulsory section comprised of  
the Ravensburger Waltz and Tagno Romantica. They were rated first 
unanimously by the panel, which included judges from Canada and the 
United States, scoring marks mostly in the 5.7 to 5.8 range. 
</P>
<P>
	Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat of France were second,  
although the American judge gave a second on his card to the other 
Russian couple, Irina Lobacheva and Ilia Averbach, third overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Anissina once skated with Averbach for the former Soviet Union  
and won two junior world championships with him before moving to 
France. 
</P>
<P>
	The original dance to the waltz rhythm follows on Thursday with  
the free dance on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Senate Passes Key Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's Senate passed a key austerity  
measure Tuesday that is expected to save $2.1 billion a year by 
reducing pension payments to 300,000 federal retirees. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, which was passed last week by the Chamber of  
Deputies, was considered an important move to convince 
international investors that Brazil was serious about putting its 
financial house in order. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill now goes to President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who is  
expected to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate approved the bill in a symbolic vote -- a  
parliamentary maneuver that avoids a roll call identifying those 
who voted for and against the measure. Opposition politicians 
demanded that Senate clerks record they were opposed to the 
unpopular measure, which will cut federal pensions by as much as 25 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's passage gives the government a much-needed boost,  
showing investors that it can spur Congress into action on crucial 
economic reform measures. 
</P>
<P>
	The global financial crisis engulfed Brazil in August, when  
investors withdrew funds for fear the government would not be able 
to cover a $65 billion budget deficit and might default on its 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's recent problems in approving fiscal reforms  
helped rekindle investor fears. After spending billions of dollars 
in foreign reserves trying to prop up its overvalued currency, the 
real, Brazil began last week to take a series of steps to devalue 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	The real has lost about 34 percent of its value since then. On  
Tuesday, the real closed at 1.82 to the dollar.

<HEADLINE> Weather Cuts Crude Demands  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures sank Tuesday on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange amid expectations unseasonable weather would cut demand 
for crude products at a time when the world remains awash in oil. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, coffee futures jumped amid concern about  
damage and shipping delays for Colombia's crop, while sugar futures 
sank anew as economic turmoil caused uncertainty about shipments 
from Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude fell as parts of the Northeast and Midwest, the nation's  
largest heating regions, basked in above-normal temperatures and 
the National Weather Service predicted things will remain that way 
for the next month. 
</P>
<P>
	That likely would sharply reduce demand for heating oil and  
natural gas as consumers turn down their thermostats, and will 
leave virtually no room for a late-season cold snap to improve the 
demand picture. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation comes as market participants digested word that  
many of the world oil producers who had agreed to cut daily output 
were exceeded their quotas. Analysts had expressed concern that 
such a situation would occur if attempts to prop prices did not 
swiftly show results, which they have not. Further, the Clinton 
administration has proposed allowing Iraq to export as much oil as 
it can to purchase food and humanitarian aid, raising concern that 
even greater supplies will be coming to market in the next few 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Light, sweet crude for March delivery fell 25 cents to $12.44 a  
barrel; the expiring February heating oil contract fell 0.86 cent 
to 32.15 cents a gallon, while March fell 0.95 cent to 32.43 cents 
a gallon. The expiring February unleaded gasoline contract fell 
0.70 cent to 34.83 cents a gallon, while March fell 0.85 cent to 
36.02 cents a gallon. February natural gas fell 6.4 cents to $1.714 
cents for each 1,000 cubic feet, while March fell 6.1 cents to 
$1.744. 
</P>
<P>
	After the market closed, the American Petroleum Insitute  
reported that U.S. crude oil stocks rose 5.380 billion barrels last 
week to 327.27 billion barrels. Gasoline stocks fell 2.44 billion 
barrels to 221.937 billion barrels. Refineries were operating at 
91.7 percent capacity, down from 95.5 percent the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures jumped on the Board of Trade of the City of New  
York after an earthquake rocked Colombia, raising concerns that 
exports from the world's second-largest coffee grower and the 
largest grower of gourmet-quality beans will see its exports 
disrupted. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts called the increase a knee-jerk reaction to the quake,  
which struck some key coffee-growing regions, because most of the 
beans scheduled for export this month likely already at aboard 
ships at port. Further, the peak coffee consumption period is 
winding down, and U.S. supplies remain ample. 
</P>
<P>
	March coffee rose 1.05 cents to $1.07 a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Sugar futures continued their slide on the New York Board of  
Trade amid concern that Brazil's currency problems would prompt 
producers there to export more of their product to gain hard cash. 
Brazil is the world's largest and, along with many other world 
growers, produced a large crop that has depressed prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar futures prices now are at their lowest since September and  
are closing in on five-year lows. 
</P>
<P>
	March sugar fell .24 cent to 6.73 cents a pound.

2004 Olympics denied a report that he made an offer to an agent who 
reportedly bought International Olympic Committee votes in the Salt 
Lake City scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The agent, Mahmoud el-Farnawani, was quoted today by the Swedish  
newspaper Dagens Nyheter as denying a report in Monday's Wall 
Street Journal that quoted him as saying Stockholm bid chief Olof 
Stenhammar ``made this big offer ... it would be shameful for the 
Swedish people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a prepared statement, Stenhammar said today that he met  
Farnawani only once and ``the accusation -- if it has been made -- is 
completely false with no connection to reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a discussion on the IOC and the bidding process, of  
which he had experience from earlier bid. I was never offered any 
services related to the question and I did not offer or in any way 
ask for any,'' Stenhammar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the Wall Street Journal report, Farnawani told  
Dagens Nyheter that, ``What's in there isn't correct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I made it clear for (Stenhammar) that I did not want to work  
for Stockholm because I had earlier been involved in the competitor 
city Istanbul's candidacy. I was very disappointed when Stockholm 
and not Istanbul got a place in the final round of voting.''

<HEADLINE> Clippers Expect Olowokandi Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALM DESERT, Calif. (AP) -- Michael Olowokandi, the overall No. 1  
draft choice who played in Italy during the lockout, is expected to 
join the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been delayed by paperwork,'' Clippers spokesman Joe  
Safety said. ``It took him three or four days just to get over 
there. It's going to take some time to get back here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 7-foot-1 center was released from his contract with Kinder  
Bologna of the Italian League on Monday. He originally was under 
contract with them through Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers, working out at College of the Desert, initially  
expected Olowokandi to join them on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The team returns to Los Angeles on Wednesday and plays  
exhibition games against the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday and 
Saturday nights. It is not known if Olowokandi will play in those 
games. The Clippers open their season Feb. 5 against Phoenix.

<HEADLINE> Laura Dern Honored at Film Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- Laura Dern's colleagues swapped spirited  
anecdotes about the actress, who was honored during the Sundance 
Film Festival for taking creative risks. 
</P>
<P>
	Dern won the festival's Piper-Heidsieck Tribute to Independent  
Vision, an award handed out Monday at the Egyptian Theatre with 
Isabella Rossellini as host. 
</P>
<P>
	When Dern was cast as the ingenue in 1986's ``Blue Velvet,''  
Rossellini knew her only from her performance as a blind girl in 
``Mask.'' Rossellini recalled, ``I didn't think the role called for 
a blind actress, but it was a David Lynch film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rossellini drew laughs with her next recollection -- that she  
even tried to guide Dern across the set, until she finally realized 
Dern could see. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossellini and ``Mask'' director Peter Bogdanovich praised Dern  
in person, with video greetings sent from friends including Billy 
Bob Thornton, her director in the upcoming ``Daddy and Them.''

<HEADLINE> Truce Holds at Super Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Dan Reeves looked uncomfortable wearing a suit and  
a smile as he stood stiffly in a corner, waiting for the cue from 
an ESPN stagehand to begin his news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``This thing has come a long way from my first Super Bowl in  
1970,'' the Atlanta Falcons' coach drawled. ``Now you can't start a 
press conference until somebody motions, like the Indy 500.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finally the cue came and the interview session began, but to the  
disappointment of the assembled media, there were no head-on 
collisions involving Reeves and Denver Broncos coach Mike Shanahan. 
</P>
<P>
	After several days of public feuding, their tenuous truce held  
Monday. Shanahan even praised the coach who fired him seven years 
ago when both were on the Broncos' staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan's done a great job,'' Shanahan said. ``To do what they did  
this year, you've got a lot of people doing a lot of good things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after arriving in Miami on Sunday, Reeves apologized for  
discussing how his relationship with Shanahan and Denver 
quarterback John Elway had soured. By Monday, even the media 
appeared weary of the feuding, with just one question raised on the 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why are you bringing it up?'' Reeves responded. ``I apologized  
yesterday. I'm trying to forget about it. The only thing that's 
going to heal those wounds is time. I don't need to be scratching 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That said, players and coaches from both teams turned their  
attention to the other topics that will be with them throughout the 
longest week in sports, including: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Reeves' recent heart surgery (``To a lot of people in Atlanta,  
I'm a sentimental favorite, but I don't know how far it goes past 
Atlanta,'' he said.); 
</P>
<P>
	-- Elway's anticipated retirement (``My gut feeling is that this  
will be his last game,'' Shanahan said.); 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Falcons' Dirty Bird dance (``It's a combination of Gregory  
Hines and Baryshnikov,'' running back Jamal Anderson said.); 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Super Bowl spotlight (``Now that I'm here, I'm center  
stage, and I'm going to take advantage of it,'' Falcons cornerback 
Ray Buchanan said.); 
</P>
<P>
	-- Turnovers (``We need to hold onto the ball,'' announced  
Broncos receiver Rod Smith.). 
</P>
<P>
	The players showed no more appetite for controversy than the  
coaches. No one wanted to echo or challenge Buchanan's guarantee 
last week of an Atlanta victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can guarantee we're going to show up,'' Smith said.  
</P>
<P>
	The week may become a contest to determine which team can appear  
more relaxed. The Falcons, playing in their first Super Bowl, claim 
they're at ease because they're seven-point underdogs with nothing 
to lose (aside from the NFL title). 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been on a team where the players are so loose  
during the week,'' Buchanan said. ``We want that this week. Then 
you start feeling confident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos say they're laid back because they've been through  
this all before, upsetting Green Bay in last year's championship 
game. Denver safety Steve Atwater, however, noted that such a 
comfort zone can be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more difficult to come in here as the defending  
champions,'' he said. ``You're a little complacent and relaxed 
because you've been here before. It's something we have to guard 
against.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The battle against complacency will wait until Wednesday,  
however. Neither team practiced today on what is known during Super 
Bowl Week as Media Day.

<HEADLINE> Warner-Lambert To Acquire Agouron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Warner-Lambert Co. continued its push into  
pharmaceuticals with the acquisition of a San Diego-based 
biotechnology company and its wildly successful AIDS product. 
</P>
<P>
	A $2.1 billion stock deal announced Tuesday gives Warner-Lambert  
control of Agouron Pharmaceuticals Inc., which debuted its Viracept 
product in March 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The protease inhibitor for people infected with HIV, the virus  
which causes AIDS, brought in $308 million during its first full 
year on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner-Lambert has long sold several oral products, including  
Trident and Dentyne gums, Certs mints, Halls throat drops and 
Listerine Mouthwash. It is also the world's top maker of hard 
gelatin medication coatings and produces the over-the-counter drugs 
Sudafed, Actifed and Benadryl. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which earned $1.3 billion in 1998 on revenue of  
$10.2 billion, is now setting its sights on the burgeoning biotech 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Its new drugs include Lipitor, the most widely prescribed  
cholesterol-lowering drug on the U.S. market, and Rezulin, a 
diabetes drug that can reduce or end a patient's need for insulin. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Tuesday's agreement, each share of Agouron stock will be  
exchanged for about $60 worth of Warner-Lambert stock, providing 
the price is between $64.52 and $74 at the close of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Agouron will continue to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of  
Warner-Lambert and retain its current management structure, company 
spokeswoman Donna Nichols said. 
</P>
<P>
	Agouron, which develops drugs for treatment of cancer, AIDS and  
eye diseases, earned $13.2 million last year on revenue of $466.5 
million. The company has been an innovator in designing synthetic 
drugs that target the molecular level of disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition will allow Agouron to continue its research and  
development of treatments while giving it Warner-Lambert's 
financial muscle to get those drugs on the market, company 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a carefully considered strategic move to maximize  
Agouron's long-term ability to bring forward new drugs for patients 
confronted by cancer, viral infection, and diseases of the eye and, 
at the same time, to contribute its scientific strengths to 
Warner-Lambert's efforts to discover innovative drugs in other 
important fields,'' Agouron president Peter Johnson said in a 
prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Agouron will remain in San Diego's La Jolla headquarters, with  
Johnson reporting to Warner-Lambert's Morris Plain, N.J., 
headquarters. Company officials said employee cutbacks weren't 
immediately expected and would only involve redundant positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Agouron employs more than 1,000 people; about 700 are involved  
in research and development. Warner-Lambert employs more than 
40,000 people worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale is subject to acceptance by Agouron shareholders and  
regulatory approval.

<HEADLINE> Avery Dennison To Cut 1,500 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Label and office products maker Avery  
Dennison Corp. is eliminating 1,500 jobs, or 9.3 percent of its 
work force, and is closing eight facilities in a bid to cut costs 
and boost profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves announced today will save between $15 million to $18  
million in 1999, according to Philip M. Neal, president and chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
	He said when fully implemented, the cuts will save between $58  
million to $62 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery Dennison makes peel-and-stick postage stamps, battery  
labels, automated retail tag and labeling systems and specialty 
tapes and chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has about 16,100 employees in 200 manufacturing and  
sales facilities worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	It is closing an office products plant in Rochelle, Ill., and a  
materials plant in Germany, spokesman Charles Coleman. He said a 
materials production plant in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., will be 
closed and be converted for use as a distribution center with fewer 
employees required. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman said the five other facilities being closed have not  
been identified or announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring will result in a one-time charge of $60  
million to $65 million before taxes, or 40 cents to 42 cents per 
share after taxes, in the first quarter. The restructuring charge 
will include severance costs, related asset write-offs and other 
one-time expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Neal said he expects the realignment will ``position the company  
for double-digit earnings growth in 1999 and beyond'' excluding the 
charge.

<HEADLINE>  Albright Telephones Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- As the gap between the United States and Russia  
remained wide, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright appealed to 
President Boris Yeltsin today to not let ``one or another 
difference'' on key issues spoil the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright telephoned Yeltsin, who is hospitalized for treatment  
of an ulcer, and spoke with him for about 25 minutes, James P. 
Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She raised the importance of maintaining the relationship in a  
position of solving problems,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said Yeltsin sounded strong, but did not detail what he  
had said to her. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian president's spokesman subsequently issued a  
statement saying Yeltsin had expressed concern to Albright about 
steps taken in Washington aimed at starting work on a national 
missile defense. He also told Albright that Russia objects to the 
use of force in Iraq, the Balkans and elsewhere without the 
specific approval of the U.N. Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the statement said, Yeltsin said he recognized  
that ``cooperation is a factor of international life'' and told her 
that ``differences on some issues should not obscure the common, 
basic strategic goals of the two countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin also stressed the importance of the International  
Monetary fund reaching a decision quickly on economic assistance 
for Russia, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin and Albright reconfirmed ``the importance of Russia and  
the United States dealing with their bilateral relationship on the 
basis of equality and respect,'' the statement added. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton also has talked to Yeltsin by telephone since  
he was here for summit talks in early September. Those September 
meetings were the last in which Yeltsin was seen by a senior U.S. 
official. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright offered Yeltsin assurances on arms control, saying the  
United States remained committed to a 1972 treaty with the Soviet 
Union that bans a national defense against missiles. ``We want to 
work with you if it needs amending,'' Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent declarations by Albright, Defense Secretary William Cohen  
and other U.S. officials that the United States must gird itself to 
defend against ``new threats'' from rogue states has alarmed the 
Russians that the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty is doomed. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., chairman of the Senate Foreign  
Relations Committee, declared last week he intends to consign it to 
``the dustbin ofd history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright's pitch to Yeltsin was that Russia should join with the  
United States in considering modifying the accord. 
</P>
<P>
	On the economic front, Albright told the Russian leader that  
U.S. support for international aid depended on the adoption of 
``sound policies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright had planned to talk to Yeltsin on Monday, but the call  
was postponed without explanation. That raised speculation that 
Yeltsin either was too ill to talk to her or that the relationship 
had gone into a deep freeze. 
</P>
<P>
	From Iraq to the Balkans, on the secret transfer of Russian  
technology to Iran, and on an emerging U.S. plan to build a missile 
defense shield, Albright and the Russians are in clear 
disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
	A special effort was due to be made later today on Kosovo, where  
the two sides begin at least with the joint goal of a political 
settlement between the Serbs and the ethnic Albanians, who are in 
conflict in the Serbian province. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides meeting again today with Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov,  
Albright has been on the telephone with the foreign ministers of 
allied governments. One possibility is a meeting of the so-called 
Contact Group of six nations at the end of the week in Paris or 
London, although Rubin said one is not set yet. 
</P>
<P>
	There are at least two problems.  
</P>
<P>
	Russia does not agree with the Clinton administration that  
bombing the Serbs may be the only way to get Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic to ease off on the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, the Clinton administration does not want to  
send U.S. ground troops to the province as part of a NATO 
peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	Discussion of Russia's economic problems dominated a three-hour  
dinner Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov had with Albright in a small 
dining room at the Russian White House on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Primakov, who is due to go to Washington in March to see Vice  
President Al Gore, dwelled on Russia's debt problem. 
</P>
<P>
	On a positive note, Russia has honored a pledge to pay off  
foreign investors for the first quarter of 1999, making two 
Eurobond payments that total $320 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Reflecting frayed relations, Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov, head of  
international military cooperation at the Russian defense ministry, 
was quoted by ITAR-Tass news agency as lashing out at the Clinton 
administration as in violation of arms control treaties and of 
exaggerating missile threats posed by Iran and North Korea to 
justify the possible deployment of a national missile defense 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States is misleading world opinion,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In a conciliatory vein, Albright sympathized with the ``hard  
times'' Russians are experiencing, and her strategic advisers 
sought an understanding on reduced levels of tanks and other 
military equipment in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Jury: Bone-Thugs Rapper Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Jurors who took less than an hour to  
acquit a Grammy Award-winning rapper of assault and disorderly 
conduct charges said they were left with too many questions after 
four days of testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, they wondered why only rapper Bizzy Bone was  
charged when testimony showed two of his bodyguards were involved 
in a scuffle with a barber college student, juror Robert Radcliffe 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bone's real name is Bryon McCane. He's a soloist with the rap  
group Bone Thugs-N-Harmony. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges against McCane, 22, stemmed from an alleged  
altercation with Terrance Harden, 26, last Sept. 16 at the Hair 
Experts Barber School. 
</P>
<P>
	Trial testimony from both sides said Harden was manhandled in  
the barber college stairwell by the two bodyguards. Harden 
testified he suffered cuts to his hands, a bruise to his neck and 
back pain. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Harden and his witnesses said McCane yanked Harden's  
collar, McCane and one of his bodyguards said McCane never joined 
in the tussle. 
</P>
<P>
	McCane, who is from the Columbus of Worthington, testified that  
he had gone to the barber school to talk to Harden, an 
acquaintance. He said he felt threatened by comments Harden 
allegedly had made. He said when he walked away, he heard the 
scuffle and turned to see his bodyguards grabbing Harden. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was one word against the other,'' jury foreman M. Eugene  
Gilliom said. ``It was a question of whose word did you choose to 
believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCane's attorney said earlier the rapper believed the charges  
were an attempt to get money from him. McCane's group won the 1997 
Grammy for best rap performance by a duo or group. 
</P>
<P>
	Harden said he will file a civil lawsuit against McCane to cover  
his legal and medical bills.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Advance / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybeans futures advanced early today  
on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures rallied amid concern that high winds in winter  
wheat growing regions would damage young crops there and amid a 
lack of precipitation that leave the emerging crop vulnerable to a 
late-season cold snap. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans bounced higher following losses a day earlier,  
but prices were expected to remain under pressure from beneficial 
moisture in competing growing regions of Brazil and Argentina and 
economic instability in Latin America that could promote more 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery rose 3 1/4 cents to $2.72 3/4 a bushel; March  
corn rose 3/4 cent to $2.16 1/4 a bushel; March oats rose 1/2 cent to 
$1.07 1/4 a bushel; March soybeans rose 3/4 cent to $5.18 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures were mostly lower on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	February live cattle fell .38 cent to 62.82 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle fell .37 cent to 74.15 cents a pound; February lean 
hogs fell .82 cent to 43.60 cents a pound; February pork bellies 
fell .80 cent to 54.95 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Senate Urged To Call Witnesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors want to put Monica Lewinsky  
and others on the witness stand to clear up factual disputes -- but 
also to let senators judge by looking them in the eye. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing they could get out of testimony by Monica  
Lewinsky would be large television ratings,'' said Georgetown law 
professor Louis Michael Seidman. That could help prosecutors, he 
added, because ``their only hope is to get people focused on it so 
that minds might change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., told senators at President Clinton's  
impeachment trial Tuesday that Ms. Lewinsky could describe the 
``tone and tenor'' of her conversations with the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``The concealment of the gifts -- what really happened there? And  
the job search,'' he added. ``Wouldn't it be nice to hear Ms. 
Lewinsky's version of this?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors also want presidential friend Vernon Jordan to  
testify about when he knew the true nature of the relationship 
between Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky. And they want to ask White House 
aide Sidney Blumenthal about his conversations with Clinton after 
the scandal broke publicly last January. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeing and hearing Ms. Lewinsky, Jordan and Blumenthal in person  
will help senators judge their credibility and resolve factual 
issues, prosecutors told the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ms. Lewinsky would risk losing her immunity from prosecution  
if she changed her story during the impeachment trial in any 
significant way. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal observers noted that Jordan and Blumenthal are hostile to  
the prosecutors' case that the president broke the law in hiding 
his affair with Ms. Lewinsky. Her current views are not known, 
although she volunteered to a grand jury last summer that no one 
told her to lie or promised her a job in exchange for her denial of 
an affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors apparently are ``hoping that some of the witnesses  
such as Vernon Jordan would not be believed,'' said Northwestern 
University law professor Steven Lubet. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators need to see how the witnesses respond to questioning,  
Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., said, adding, ``Look them in the eye 
and make that determination yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., said he wanted to ask Jordan about  
Ms. Lewinsky's assertion that she told him her former friend Linda 
Tripp might have seen notes she wrote to Clinton. Hutchinson said 
Ms. Lewinsky quoted Jordan as saying, ``Go home and make sure 
they're not there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyer, David Kendall, said Jordan was never asked at  
the grand jury about the matter and contended it was a ``gratuitous 
smear'' of Jordan to bring it up. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors also sought permission to submit a sworn  
statement by T. Wesley Holmes, a lawyer for Paula Jones, whose 
sex-harassment lawsuit against Clinton unearthed his affair with 
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would be a very interesting witness,'' Kendall said, adding  
that the chance to question Holmes under oath ``would provide a 
great deal of information about what really motivated the events of 
January 1998'' when the affair became public. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors did not seek testimony from Clinton's private  
secretary, Betty Currie, who in December 1997 picked up from Ms. 
Lewinsky gifts the president had given her. Ms. Lewinsky has 
testified that Mrs. Currie called her to arrange to pick up the 
gifts, while Mrs. Currie said she thought Ms. Lewinsky suggested 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Lubet, of Northwestern, said prosecutors might have decided not  
to seek Mrs. Currie's testimony because it could create doubt about 
the prosecution's case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Put the burden on the president to call her,'' Lubet said.  
``If the president calls her, the prosecution says, 'Believe 
Monica.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson said he wants to ask Jordan whether he saw an  
unsigned draft of Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit denying a sexual 
relationship with Clinton and whether they discussed its contents, 
as she said they did. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the way,'' Hutchinson added, ``I hate giving prospective  
witnesses all my questions.''

<HEADLINE> Babbitt Warns About Exotic Sea Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Foreign marine life invading waters  
where they are not normally found has grown into a multibillion 
dollar problem as fishermen continue to dump exotic species, 
bacteria and viruses from their boats, biologists warned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The sea life is often found lurking in cargo holds or in ballast  
water pumped in to stabilize ships during their voyage and then 
pumped out when they reach their destination. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the invaders take hold, they can devour native species,  
alter food chains and change whole ecosystems, biologists say. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of global marine hitchhikers and now is the  
time to take action,'' said Secretary of the Interior Bruce 
Babbitt, who spoke Tuesday at the first international Marine 
Bioinvasions Conference at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Bioinvasion costs government and industry $123 billion a year to  
control on land and at sea, according to a study released at a 
meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, 
Babbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the San Francisco Bay area -- where there are more than 250  
known exotic invaders -- one of the most voracious predators has 
been the Asian clam introduced in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The mud-dwelling clams feed by filtering out food particles in  
the water column. 
</P>
<P>
	``The clams have been filtering out so much of the water that we  
haven't seen annual blooms of phytoplankton since the 1980s,'' said 
Andy Cohen, a marine biologist for the San Francisco Estuary 
Institute in Richmond, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	That means animals who eat phytoplankton have been stripped of  
an essential food source, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In New England, a type of Japanese algae is now aggressively  
taking root along the coast. Meanwhile, an organism from New 
England -- called a comb jelly -- was exported to the Black Sea and 
has decimated an economically important anchovy fishery. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing scientists did in the past was introduce predator  
species to control invaders. But now, fearing new species could 
further threaten ecosystems, scientists have been developing 
methods that would stop the invaders before they make it to foreign 
waters. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt on Tuesday called for mandatory ballast water exchange  
programs and urged Congress to work on bioinvasion before it 
becomes a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposals include giving agencies the muscle to enforce what  
could amount to international regulations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballast exchange programs would require a ship coming from the  
Mediterranean, for example, to dump its ballast water in the deep 
seas -- at least 200 miles from shore and about 2,000 feet deep -- 
then replace it with deep sea water. 
</P>
<P>
	The theory is that organisms found in deep sea water have a  
harder time surviving in water closer to the coasts, and vice 
versa.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Russia Agree on Tech Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The United States and Russia announced agreement  
today on tightening controls over American technology contained in 
U.S. satellites that are launched by Russia from Kazakstan. 
</P>
<P>
	The aim is to prevent ``leakage'' of the technology to Iran and  
other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven satellites are due to be launched before the end of 2000.  
Russia and Kazakstan, a former Soviet republic, are due to share at 
least $400 million in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement clears the way for heightened monitoring by  
Defense Department officials of the launches, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration recently threatened to end Russian  
launching after concluding three Russian firms had provided Iran 
with sensitive technology. 
</P>
<P>
	During two days of talks here with Secretary of State Madeleine  
Albright, Russian officials sought to convince their U.S. 
counterparts that the administration had acted on the basis of 
false information. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. side said, however, there was no doubt about the  
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the new agreement, the threat to cut off launches  
remains until ``the problem of missile cooperation between Russian 
enterprises and the Iranian missile program is resolved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cutoff would apply to any new applications for launches  
after the remaining seven are carried out. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellites, which facilitate cellular telephone and other  
commercial communication, are in great demand, a U.S. official told 
reporters, and Russia and Kazakstan stand to gain considerable 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	But first, said the official, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, safeguards must be assured. 
</P>
<P>
	Satellite launches were suspended in September, pending  
completion of the agreement with Russia and Kazakstan. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement contains specific procedures to ensure the Defense  
Department can monitor U.S. technology in Russia and at the launch 
site, the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakstan.

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com's Losses Quadruple </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Amazon.com Inc. continued to pile on the losses  
in the fourth quarter, though they were smaller than Wall Street 
analysts had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales at the giant bookseller more than tripled as shoppers  
flocked to the Internet to do their holiday buying. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle-based company reported Tuesday that it lost $46.43  
million, or 30 cents a share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 
compared with a loss of $10.81 million, or 8 cents a share, in the 
same period a year ago. The results include a charge of $24.2 
million for costs associated with recent acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were $252.89 million, up from $66.04 million a year ago.  
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the charges, Amazon.com lost $22.18 million, or 14  
cents a share, in the fourth quarter. Analysts surveyed by First 
Call had expected its operating losses to be 18 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com reported its results after U.S. financial markets  
closed Tuesday. Shares of Amazon rose $2.71 7/8 to $115.09 3/8 in trading 
on the Nasdaq Stock Market, while investors sent the stock soaring 
in after-hours trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1995, Amazon.com has yet to make a profit as it  
spends freely to advertise its site and expand its offerings. It 
added music, videos and a small selection of electronics and toys 
to its site last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its continued losses, it is a favorite stock on Wall  
Street, with investors bidding up Amazon.com shares in recent 
months on expectations that it will be a big winner as more people 
shop on the Internet in the coming years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amazon.com is spending a lot of money on sales and marketing,  
but that is money well spent,'' said Jae Kim, an analyst at Paul 
Kagan &AMP; Associates in Carmel, Calif. ``It is the cost of doing 
business on the Web and without it, you can't really do business 
successfully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The number of customer accounts at Amazon.com's World Wide Web  
site increased by more than 1.7 million during the fourth quarter 
to nearly 6.2 million. That compares with 1.5 million customer 
accounts at the end of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	About 25 percent of its sales in the fourth quarter came from  
its music, video and international markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of music, which it began to sell in June, were $33.1  
million, more than double the $14.4 million that was sold in the 
third quarter. The company didn't provide sales figures for its 
video division, which began on Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com's British and German operations nearly quadrupled  
over the third quarter, making them the No. 1 online booksellers in 
their countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com also said that it would expand its distribution  
system to better handle orders. During the holidays, Amazon.com 
could not fulfill all of its processing in a timely manner and some 
customers received gifts after Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com previously announced that it was leasing a new  
distribution center in Nevada that would speed up its shipping 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	For 1998, Amazon.com lost $124.55 million, or 84 cents a share,  
compared with a loss of $31.02 million, or 24 cents a share, in 
1997. Sales totaled $609.99 million, up from $147.79 million last 
year.

<HEADLINE> Hand Transplant Patient Doing Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Thirteen years after an explosive blew  
off his left hand, Matthew David Scott has a new one. 
</P>
<P>
	``He stares at it and grins,'' family friend James Brown said  
Monday as Scott, a paramedic from Absecon, N.J., recovered from the 
first hand transplant in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14 1/2-hour surgery ended early Monday at Jewish Hospital in  
Louisville. His doctors said Scott, 37, was doing as well as 
possible. They watched closely for blood clots, other complications 
and any sign that the donor hand was being rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't expect to see rejection in the early phase. Our big  
concern is in the first three months,'' said Dr. Jon William Jones 
Jr., an organ rejection expert who was part of the surgical team. 
</P>
<P>
	A hospital spokeswoman said today there were no blood clots or  
other complications overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is doing very well,'' Kim Freeman said. ``He's alert.  
Everything is progressing as expected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tiny pieces of skin from the hand will be microscopically  
examined every few days to see if lymphocytes -- tissue-killing 
cells -- are attacking it, Jones said. If so, Scott's medication 
could be adjusted. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott was being given powerful drugs that reduce the chances of  
rejection but pose significant dangers of their own. His suppressed 
immune system makes him vulnerable to infections that could be life 
threatening, said Jones and the lead surgeon, Dr. Warren 
Breidenbach. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott lost his dominant hand in a Dec. 23, 1985, blast from an  
M-80, which resembles a firecracker but is far more powerful. M-80s 
have been illegal in the United States since 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Courier-Journal before the surgery,  
Scott said the accident that cost him his hand came at a friend's 
house after a night of partying. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was 24,'' Scott said. ``It was Christmas. We were ... out at  
a club, laughing it up, having a good time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The firecracker was sitting out in the open. Scott said he  
``very foolishly'' picked it up, and, ``with a young man's 
bravado,'' touched his cigarette to the wick. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast from the M-80 tore most of his hand off, leaving parts  
of two fingers but little else. What remained was amputated above 
the wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott got a prosthetic hand and resumed working. In 1990, he was  
named National Paramedic of the Year by Emergency Medical Services 
magazine, said Tom Starr, director of the Mobile Intensive Care 
Unit at Virtua Health, where 
</P>
<P>
	Scott now oversees paramedic training in southern New Jersey. He  
also is assistant director of the School of Paramedic Science at 
Camden County College. 
</P>
<P>
	Some doctors have questioned the risks of transplanting a  
nonvital organ such as a hand. Breidenbach said Scott was chosen 
because he had not adapted well to his artificial hand and is 
intelligent, articulate and has support from his family, which 
includes his wife and two young sons. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott learned about the Louisville doctors' plans to attempt a  
hand transplant last summer, when his wife read a newspaper article 
while they were vacationing in London. He called the hospital hours 
after returning home. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview before his surgery, Scott said that with his  
artificial hand he lived in fear of going through buffet lines and 
handling food at parties. Nor was he able to show his sons how to 
play baseball, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always been the little things -- the daily little  
things,'' Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Scott can only hope to gain limited use of the  
transplanted hand -- able to pick up objects but unable to button 
his shirt, Breidenbach said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You should be able to get fairly good flexation and extension  
-- not complete -- and some sensation, but not normal,'' Breidenbach 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeons for years have been able to reattach severed limbs  
following accidents, but they had never been able to successfully 
transfer a limb from a dead donor to a living recipient. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, a hand transplant was performed in Lyon, France,  
on a New Zealand man who lost part of his right arm in a prison 
sawing accident in 1984. At least one attempt at a hand transplant 
occurred in South America in 1964, but the patient's body rejected 
the hand within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent surgery joined the cadaver hand a bit above  
wristwatch level with Scott's arm. The surgeons had to join the 
bones, clamping them together with metal plates and screws. Tendons 
were attached and gently tugged to make sure they would cause 
fingers to move. 
</P>
<P>
	Nerves were joined next, then arteries and veins. The hospital  
refused to disclose any information about the donor.

<TEXT>
<P>
	EDINA, Minn. (AP) -- Regis Corp. agreed to acquire The Barbers,  
Hairstyling for Men and Women Inc., in a stock deal worth about $58 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Regis is already the world's largest owner, operator and  
franchiser of hair and retail salons, with some 3,600 units. By 
acquiring The Barbers, it will add another 979 franchised and 
owner-operated salons. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of The Barbers' management, including President and  
Chief Executive Officer Fred Huggins Jr., will join the senior 
management team at Regis. Barbers Chairman Flo Francis, the widow 
of the company's founder, will serve in an advisory capacity and 
John Francis, her son, will remain on the management team. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal will also make Regis the sole provider of salon  
services in Wal-Mart stores. The Barbers, based in Minneapolis, now 
has 187 Cost Cutter salons in Wal-Mart, and Regis has about 300 
under the name SmartStyle. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company will retain the Regis name and its

<HEADLINE> Antarctica Artifacts Returned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTT BASE, Antarctica (AP) -- Artifacts stolen from a hut used  
by a famous South Pole explorer were brought back to the Antarctic 
today, more than 40 years after they disappeared from their home. 
</P>
<P>
	British Environment Minister Michael Meacher, one of 24  
officials visiting the frozen continent this week, returned the 
items to Cape Evans, where the hut of English explorer Robert F. 
Scott stands as a symbol of his daring journey. 
</P>
<P>
	The items -- a dog harness, a coat hook and a lantern -- were  
taken in 1957 by a Royal New Zealand Air Force pilot who was 
working in the region. They were about to be sold last year at a 
London auction when the New Zealand government complained. 
</P>
<P>
	``We heard about these goods just before they were to be sold at  
Christie's and prevailed upon the owner to hand them over,'' said 
Meacher. ``It seemed an ideal opportunity to return them to 
Antarctica.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He gave the items to the Antarctic Heritage Trust.  
</P>
<P>
	Meacher and the other officials toured a number of sites in  
Antarctica today, including the hut used by Scott. The explorer 
died in 1912 on his return from an unsuccessful attempt to become 
the first man to reach the South Pole. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Scott and his party reached the pole on Jan. 17, 1912,  
they were 33 days behind Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen. Scott 
and his team died in blizzards on their return journey. 
</P>
<P>
	At the hut, Scott's sleeping bag remains on his bunk, as if he  
had just left it, and a stuffed emperor penguin is stretched out on 
his desk for examination. On the porch of the hut stands a box of 
penguin eggs and piles of seal blubber. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the carefully preserved building, the freeze-dried  
carcass of a sled dog remains chained to the back door, where it 
was left behind by Scott and his men. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years ``hundreds if not thousands of items'' have been  
taken from expedition huts that are preserved in the region, said 
Stuart Prior of New Zealand's Antarctic Policy Unit. Prior said a 
``trickle'' of them are now being returned. 
</P>
<P>
	During their visit, the 24 officials will discuss a slew of  
problems that the Antarctic faces, including environmental hazards, 
fishing disputes and a recent tourist boom that threatens its 
status as one of the most unspoiled places on earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Antarctic Treaty, the frozen continent is the only one  
in the world devoted to peace and science.

<HEADLINE> Texaco Posts Fourth Quarter Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Texaco Inc. became the latest oil company to  
announce sharply lower earnings for the fourth quarter, reporting a 
net loss of $213 million due to low oil prices and currency losses 
in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss, which worked out to 43 cents a share, compared to a  
profit of $623 million, or $1.12 per share, in the same period of 
1997. Quarterly revenues tumbled 35 percent to $7.81 billion from 
$12.05 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's stock was off $2.12 1/2 to close at $48.50 in trading  
Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The White Plains, N.Y.-based oil company blamed the extreme  
dropoff in oil prices for the loss, saying that current prices for 
crude were the lowest the company had seen since the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Texaco also cited currency volatility in Asia, especially the  
strengthening of the Korean won and Japanese yen, for losses of $71 
million in its operations there. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's results for the fourth quarter of 1998 included  
one-time charges of $305 million, including write-downs of 
inventories and other assets. In the fourth quarter a year ago, its 
net income was boosted by a one-time gain of $193 million from the 
sale of assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Not counting the various one-time charges, Texaco's income fell  
to $92 million in the fourth quarter, or 15 cents a share, from 
$472 million, or 85 cents a share, in the same period a year ago, a 
drop of 81 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The sharp tumble in crude prices has caused a series of layoffs  
and other consolidations in the U.S. oil industry. In November, 
Texaco announced it was cutting 1,000 jobs in exploration and 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	Texaco chairman Peter I. Bijur said the company would continue  
to move ahead with cost-cutting efforts. ``We are not standing 
still, waiting for prices to improve,'' he said in a statement. 
``We are implementing significant cost and expense reductions 
across all of our businesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the full year, Texaco's profits fell to $578 million, or 99  
cents a share, from $2.66 billion, or $4.87 a share, in 1997. 
Yearly revenues fell to $31.71 billion from $46.67 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding special items in both years, Texaco's net income was  
$894 million, or $1.59 a share, in 1998, compared to $1.89 billion, 
or $3.45 a share, in 1997.

<HEADLINE> NTSB Near End of Denver Death Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Transportation Safety Board today  
held its final meeting into the cause of the airplane crash that 
killed singer John Denver in October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	After reviewing reports from a series of technical experts, the  
five-member board was to settle on a cause and make any safety 
recommendations it felt may prevent similar accidents by other 
pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on reports released last June, it appeared that low fuel,  
a hard-to-reach handle to switch gas tanks and modifications to his 
homemade airplane may have figured in Denver's crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The 53-year-old singer-songwriter, famous for such hits as  
``Rocky Mountain High'' and ``Sunshine On My Shoulders,'' was the 
lone passenger when his plane plunged into the waters off 
California's Monterey Peninsula on Oct. 12, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Denver also lacked an aviation medical certificate  
-- a requirement for a valid pilot's license. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration had disqualified Denver for  
the certificate in March 1997, after learning that he had violated 
a previous FAA order to abstain from drinking. Denver had received 
the warning in 1995 after being arrested for drunken driving. An 
autopsy showed no signs of alcohol or drugs at the time of the 
plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
	While drawing no conclusions, the preliminary report suggested  
factors that may have contributed to crash. 
</P>
<P>
	First, Denver's plane almost certainly was low on fuel when he  
took off from the Monterey Peninsula Airport in the late afternoon 
to practice takeoffs and landings. Denver bought the plane only two 
weeks earlier from another pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, there were indications that Denver would have had trouble  
switching gas tanks if one of the two in his plane had run dry. 
</P>
<P>
	The plans for his homemade Long E-Z say that the fuel selector  
handle -- which switches the fuel flow between the left and right 
tanks -- should be located between the pilot's legs. But the plane's 
builder, aircraft maker Adrian Davis Jr., said he put it behind the 
pilot's left shoulder because he did not want fuel in the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
	On the day of the crash, Denver and a maintenance technician  
talked about the inaccessibility of the handle. ``They tried a pair 
of Vice Grip pliers on the handle to extend the reach of the 
handle, but this did not work,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under those circumstances, the pilot would have had to remove  
his shoulder harness, turn around and switch the handle. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the preliminary report, Denver's plane had another  
modification besides the fuel selector location: a 150-horsepower 
engine. That was bigger than the design specifications of a 110- to 
115-horsepower engine and consumed more gas than the standard 
engine. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane's designer said he had heard of some builders  
installing up to 200-horsepower engines with no problems.

<HEADLINE> PepsiCo To Close 4 Frito-Lay Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Frito-Lay is closing four of its oldest  
production plants and is expanding five others while parent PepsiCo 
Inc. is swapping bottling operations with its biggest independent 
bottler. 
</P>
<P>
	Both moves announced Monday are designed to make the soft drink  
and snack food conglomerate more competitive by increasing 
productivity at Frito-Lay and creating bottlers big enough to serve 
sprawling retail customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The four Frito-Lay plants being closed over the next six to  
eight months employ 850 people, Frito-Lay executives said. They are 
in Chamblee, Ga., Salisbury, N.C., Jackson, Miss., and Marlborough, 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	The maker of Lay's, Doritos and Tostitos chips will expand  
capacity at five other plants in a move that could add 400 jobs 
there. Those plants are in Lynchburg, Va., Jonesboro, Ark., 
Fayetteville, Tenn., Perry, Ga., and Killingly, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	The net impact would be to reduce Frito-Lay's domestic work  
force of about 40,000 people by about 450 jobs, or a bit more than 
1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The program will result in a charge of about $120 million before  
taxes over two quarters against PepsiCo earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	PepsiCo, the Purchase, N.Y.-based conglomerate that owns the  
nation's second-largest soft drink company as well as the biggest 
snack food maker, also announced Monday it is swapping bottling 
operations with its biggest independent bottler, Whitman Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman will get rights to bottle Pepsi products in several  
Midwestern states and in Eastern Europe in exchange for a 
combination of cash, stock and bottling rights in Virginia, West 
Virginia and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The bottling deal continued PepsiCo's efforts to consolidate  
bottling of Pepsi-Cola products at a smaller number of large 
bottling businesses. The bigger bottlers are expected to serve 
expanding retail customers better. 
</P>
<P>
	PepsiCo plans to sell a majority stake in its company-owned  
bottling business, which accounts for about 54 percent of the 
volume of Pepsi-Cola products sold domestically. 
</P>
<P>
	That would free PepsiCo to focus on marketing its beverages and  
selling concentrate to the bottlers. Coca-Cola Co., the soft drink 
industry leader, has used that organizational setup for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman is its biggest independent bottler, accounting for about  
12 percent of Pepsi's domestic sales volume. After the deal 
announced Monday, it would handle about 17 percent of U.S. Pepsi 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman will get PepsiCo bottling territories in Illinois,  
Indiana, Missouri and Ohio as well as in the Czech Republic, the 
Slovak Republic, Hungary and Poland. Those businesses generated 
$720 million in revenue last year. 
</P>
<P>
	PepsiCo will get about $300 million in cash, stock representing  
about a 35 percent stake in Whitman and bottling operations in 
Marion, Va., Princeton, W. Va., and St. Petersburg, Russia, with 
combined 1998 revenue of about $77 million. 
</P>
<P>
	PepsiCo currently owns 20 percent of Whitman's bottling  
division. 
</P>
<P>
	The conglomerate also announced Monday that it expects to report  
next week that it earned 24 cents a share in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	That reflects a gain of 19 cents a share due to its November  
settlement of a tax case with the Internal Revenue Service 
involving its soft drink concrentrate operations in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	That gain will be nearly offset by charges of 17 cents a share  
in the quarter for the costs that Russia's economic crisis has had 
on its business there, the first part of the Frito-Lay plant 
realignments and the costs of separating its soft drink concentrate 
and bottling operations in North America.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., checked into a  
Baltimore hospital today to undergo observation for flu symptoms, a 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mikulski was in good condition and was expected to be released

	During Monday's impeachment debate, Mikulski felt faint, had an

Senate physician, Miller said. She didn't feel any better today and 
checked into the hospital, which Miller would not identify. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Stocks Higher; Dow Up 109 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks were higher in late afternoon,  
as companies continued today to report strong earnings and stock 
splits. Broad market indexes were higher on continued strength in 
technology shares. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 109.42 at 9,312.74 , having bailed out of a loss of nearly 15 
points earlier in the day. The Dow closed Monday at 9,203.32. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 43.86 at  
2,413.17. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 16.67 at 1,250.65. 
</P>
<P>
	But the rally was confined to high-profile names. Declining  
issues were neck and neck with advancers on the New York Stock 
Exchange. Volume was moderate at 673.26 million shares, although 
that was up from Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was led higher by IBM, whose shares were up 3 at 185  
after the company confirmed Monday's rumors that it would exchange 
two shares for every one held by investors. IBM was joined by Dow 
component McDonald's, which also announced a two-for-one split and 
raised its dividend. McDonald's shares were up 2 15/16 at 78 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	And Xerox announced that it had met analysts' fourth-quarter  
earnings goals and that it would raise its dividend and split its 
stock two for one. Xerox shares were up 12 13/16 at 118 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft shares were up 8 13/16 at 170 11/16 in Nasdaq trading  
after that company declared a stock split on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wall Street has splits on its brain here,'' said Larry  
Wachtel, Prudential Securities' market strategist. He said the 
split announcements were driving the market higher, even though 
stock splits don't always result in higher stock prices. ``It's two 
pieces of paper for one piece of paper, and yet it's embraced, it's 
loved, it's wonderful,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But noting that declining issues were still ahead of advancers,  
Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP; 
Sons Inc. in St. Louis, said the market was trading on a 
name-by-name basis. 
</P>
<P>
	He was favoring sectors that he believes will be able to post  
better earnings this year, including health care, financial 
service, technology and energy companies. 
</P>
<P>
	But Goldman said it will be increasingly difficult this year to  
find patterns. ``I think it's going to be an eclectic market,'' he 
said. ``Consumer nondurables should be going up, but cyclicals will 
go up as well.''

<HEADLINE> Parcells Skips Pro Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Bill Parcells is missing his first  
opportunity to coach in the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Jets coach received permission Tuesday from NFL  
commissioner Paul Tagliabue to skip the game Feb. 7 in Honolulu. 
Parcells underwent a series of medical tests last week, and two 
doctors who examined him recommended that he not go. Last year, he 
begged off working the Senior Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach Parcells was examined by his cardiologist, as well as by  
me in my office a couple of days after the Denver game,'' Jets 
medical director Elliott Pellman said, referring to the 23-10 loss 
for the AFC championship on Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	``He clearly was showing the physical effects of the long  
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells left coaching in 1991, quitting the New York Giants  
because of health problems. He has undergone several heart 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in the midst of preparation for the Pro Bowl with my  
staff and fully planned to carry out my obligation under the NFL 
guidelines,'' Parcells said. ``But after undergoing a thorough 
medical examination, I feel it would be a big mistake on my part 
not to listen to the doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have nothing but respect for the Pro Bowl and the great  
players who are in it. Frankly, I'll miss being around them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his place, assistant head coach Bill Belichick will run the  
AFC team, along with the entire Jets coaching staff. Minnesota's 
Dennis Green will coach the NFC. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro Bowl assignments go to the losing coaches in the conference  
championship games, and Parcells had been 3-0 in those games before 
the loss to Denver.

	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- With Copley High School leading Wadsworth by  
only two points in a crucial basketball game, a Copley fan made a 
defensive maneuver surely not addressed in Wadsworth's playbook. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as a Wadsworth player was about to throw an inbounds pass,  
the 16-year-old Copley student pulled the player's shorts down to 
his knees. 
</P>
<P>
	Copley held on to win Friday night's game, 65-60.  
</P>
<P>
	``The incident took place at a critical stage of the game, and  
it was a must-win for our team,'' Wadsworth coach John Martin said. 
``Can you imagine what kind of concentration our kid had after he 
was exposed?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Copley prankster, whose name was withheld because of his  
age, was arrested after he tried to run away. 
</P>
<P>
	He was charged with misdemeanor counts of disrupting a lawful  
meeting and disorderly conduct. Police Lt. Dave Sattler said the 
boy understood what he did was wrong and is sorry. 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't good enough for Principal Bill Steffan, who  
suspended the boy for an unspecified number of days and banned him 
from extracurricular activities.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Confidence Rises Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The rebound on Wall Street during January helped  
restore consumers' confidence in the economy, but Americans are 
still concerned about the outlook for their own finances in the 
months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey by the Conference Board released Tuesday found  
consumers are feeling better about the current financial situation 
than they did during December, particularly when it comes to the 
availability of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The business research group reported its index of consumer  
confidence rose 0.9 point to 127.6 from a revised 126.7 in 
December. The index dropped sharply in October and has since been 
making a steady recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest improvement comes in a month when the stock market  
has again reached new record highs. Some of the biggest gainers 
have been Internet issues that are sensitive to changes in the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers' sentiment is an important economic indicator since  
their spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's overall 
economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking ahead to the next six months, the Conference Board finds  
consumers aren't quite as secure. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of people who said they expect their incomes to  
increase over the next half-year dropped 5.3 percentage points, 
from 28.7 percent to 23.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, economists who analyzed the results say consumers are  
likely to be swayed by current headlines and that the index is 
therefore less valuable as a measure of how people feel about the 
economy going forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more a barometer of people's opinions rather than their  
actual behavior,'' said Diane Swonk, deputy chief economist with 
Chicago-based Bank One Corp. ``It's a poor indicator of spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're doing phenomenally well. What's key in the confidence  
numbers is that people feel about their own pocketbooks, and they 
feel really good,'' Swonk said. ``We're only a little off the 
all-time high'' of 138.2 that the Conference Board index set in 
June, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	While spending may slow a bit in the coming year, it will likely  
still be one of the strongest years of the past decade, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rise in consumer confidence was helped mostly by an increase  
in the number of consumers who said jobs currently are plentiful. 
Forty-five percent believe there are many jobs available, compared 
with 42.5 percent who said so a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``While consumer expectations have softened over the last  
several months, this vital sector of the economy continues to be 
optimistic,'' said Lynn Franco, associate director of the 
Conference Board. ``Consumers' appraisal of the current state of 
our economy is running at decade-high levels, signaling further 
growth in the months ahead.''

<HEADLINE> Flyers' Daigle Benched, in Limbo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Flyers center Alexander Daigle  
will no longer play or practice with the team after nixing a trade 
that would have sent him to Edmonton for Andrei Kovalenko. 
</P>
<P>
	Flyers general manager Bob Clarke dealt Daigle to the Oilers  
during the All-Star break, but the trade was contingent on the 
seldom-used center signing a $1 million, one-year contract with the 
Oilers. Daigle refused. 
</P>
<P>
	``He asked to be traded,'' Clarke said Tuesday night before the  
Flyers' game against Florida. ``He wanted out of here, so we're 
going to try to accommodate him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can use our trainers and stuff. He can use the facilities.  
But there's no point in hanging around with the team. He's not part 
of the team anymore. He made that decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daigle's agent, Craig Levin, told Canadian Press that the  
23-year-old center wants to play for the Oilers, but he doesn't 
want to burn an option year in the process. Daigle makes $1.9 
million this season, and the Flyers would have to pay him at least 
that amount next year to retain him. 
</P>
<P>
	``His decision wasn't no against the trade, but instead no  
against the option,'' Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daigle was the No. 1 pick in the 1993 NHL entry draft by Ottawa,  
but hasn't lived up to expectations. He has three goals and two 
assists in 31 games this season, his second in Philadelphia. He was 
traded to the Flyers last season for Vaclav Prospal, Pat Falloon 
and a second-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked earlier this season if he planned to trade Daigle,  
Clarke asked, ``Who would want him?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daigle's best season came in 1996-97, when he had 26 goals and  
25 assists for Ottawa. His agent said he'd prefer to play in Los 
Angeles or Anaheim.

<HEADLINE> Compaq To Spin Off AltaVista </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp., seeking to take advantage  
of the boom in Internet stocks, plans to spin off its AltaVista 
online search service into a separate, publicly traded company. 
</P>
<P>
	AltaVista is one of the most popular sites on the Internet,  
offering a widely used search engine and variety of other options, 
including news, stock quotes and shopping services. The spinoff 
plans announced today pushed Compaq's stock up 5 percent in early 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the announcement, Compaq said it reached a deal with  
Microsoft Corp. for AltaVista to become the primary search engine 
on the software company's online service, the Microsoft Network, to 
help boost AltaVista's visibility as it prepares for its stock 
offering. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq did not immediately provide details about when the  
offering might occur, but the announcement comes at a time of 
ferocious demand for Internet-related stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the first initial public offering of 1999 -- online  
financial news provider MarketWatch.com -- soared 474 percent about 
two weeks ago. MarketWatch followed the pattern of skyrocketing 
offerings last year from such companies as Web page provider 
theglobe.com, online auctioneer eBay.com, and Ticketmaster 
Online-CitySearch Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The newly formed AltaVista Corp. will be based in Palo Alto,  
Calif., and headed by Rod Schrock, who has been senior vice 
president of Compaq's consumer product group. Schrock led Compaq's 
recent acquisition of Shopping.com, a popular shopping Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq, the world's leading maker of personal computers,  
acquired AltaVista as part of its $9 billion takeover of Digital 
Equipment Corp. last year. Compaq shares were up $2.31 1/4 at $49 in 
morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Russians Lead Ice Dance Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- World champions Angelika Krylova  
and Oleg Ovsiannikov of Russia took the lead after the ice dance 
compulsaries today at at the European Figure Skating Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Krylova and Ovsiannikov took all first-place votes from the  
judges, scoring mostly in the 5.7-5.8 range, after a routine skated 
to the Ravensburger Waltz and Tagno Romantica. 
</P>
<P>
	Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat of France were second,  
although the U.S. judge rated another Russian couple, Irina 
Lobacheva and Ilia Averbach, second. Anissina once skated with 
Averbach for the former Soviet Union and won two junior world 
championships with him before moving to France. 
</P>
<P>
	The original dance to the waltz rhythm follows Thursday and the  
free dance is scheduled for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Russians also led the pairs and men's competitions. Yevgeny  
Plushenko was favored in the men's event competition, with a 
commanding performance at the men's qualifications Monday. 
Plushenko, barely 16, was in a class by himself while Olympic, 
world and European champions fell. 
</P>
<P>
	He entered today's short program with an advantage over 1994  
Olympic gold medalist Alexei Urmanov and defending European and 
current world champion Alexei Yagudin, his Russian teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men' event, Plushenko completed a quadruple toe loop, two  
triple-triple combinations and four other triples. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, the qualifying rounds count for 20 percent  
of the total score. The top 15 men from each of the two groups 
advanced to today's short program, which counts for another 30 
percent. The men's final free program is Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Urmanov, fell heavily on his opening jump and had a poor first  
two minutes. He recovered somewhat to end with three triples in the 
final minute to come in second to Plushenko in his group. 
</P>
<P>
	Urmanov, skating his first European since a 1997 injury, hit the  
boards on an off-center triple toe loop opening the program. 
Yagudin fared even worse, finishing behind Frenchman Laurent Tobel 
and Andreas Vlascenko of Germany in the first group. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagudin was clearly stunned by his mediocre presentation,  
falling on his first triple jump, cutting down two others to 
doubles and barely holding landings on three more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was not ready to skate like that,'' Yagudin said. ``The  
warmups were good. The practices were good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably I was in shock when I fell,'' the 18-year-old Russian  
said of his first triple axel, which he landed momentarily before 
collapsing. ``The jump was pretty good.''

<HEADLINE> Dustin Hoffman Has His Day in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dustin Hoffman not only had his day in court,  
he liked it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to flatter the judge because it looks like you're  
flattering the judge,'' the actor said Monday. ``But the experience 
was very enjoyable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge last week awarded Hoffman $1.5 million in a  
non-jury trial. Hoffman had sued Los Angeles Magazine, which 
published a computer-altered image of the actor in a designer 
evening gown and heels without his permission. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman was praised by U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian as  
``one of our country's greatest living treasures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to Xerox what he said and put it on each of my kids'  
pillows,'' Hoffman told reporters at his lawyer's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman said he was concerned about how the movie industry  
perceived the photo: ``The industry knows that there's a certain 
plane, if you will, of actors who don't do commercials. ... It 
signals a decline in your career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A decision on damages is expected Thursday.

<HEADLINE>  Pope To Meet Clinton in St. Louis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Adoring Mexicans gave a rousing farewell to  
Pope John Paul II, singing, stomping and swaying in a packed soccer 
stadium in his final public appearance before heading to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Fireworks lit up the night sky Monday as the frail pope rose  
from his chair and held up his arms to the crowd that chanted 
``John Paul II, the world loves you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 110,000 in giant Azteca Stadium heard the pope decry a  
loss of values, drug trafficking, corruption and other evils of 
modern society. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only faith in Christ gives rise to a culture contrary to  
selfishness and death,'' the pope declared. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, thousands lined up outside the Vatican's nunciate,  
or embassy, hoping to catch a last glimpse of the pope before he 
departed for St. Louis. Many had spent days staking out their 
spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Marielena Toledo, 71, traveled to Mexico City from the northern  
city of Culiacan, and a little cold or lost sleep wasn't going to 
stop her. She had huddled there under her ``Aladdin'' blanket since 
7:30 p.m. Monday; she had managed to see the pope every day of his 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
	``He transmits a very pretty vibration,'' she said, ``I imagine  
this is what it felt like when our Lord Jesus Christ was with us. 
It was another period, but the same emotion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of others lined John Paul's route to the airport,  
waving pennants that featured the pope's portrait and a heartfelt 
``adios.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The visit to St. Louis is the second leg of a mission to give  
new direction to his flock on the eve of the third millennium and 
to strengthen ties between Roman Catholics in North and Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon arriving, he was scheduled to meet with President Clinton  
in an airport hangar -- a day after the Vatican condemned the latest 
U.S. bombing raids on Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said the U.S.  
bombing ``confirms once again'' the pope's view that military 
measures ``don't resolve problems in themselves, rather they 
aggravate them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pope also has criticized U.S. policy on the death penalty,  
abortion and economic sanctions against Cuba and Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear whether Clinton's affair with White House intern  
Monica Lewinsky and his impeachment trial in the Senate will be 
discussed in the private talks between the president and the pope. 
Vatican news media have given the scandal scant attention, unlike 
the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The differences shouldn't dampen the pope's welcome for the  
30-hour visit, his seventh stop on U.S. soil during his 20-year 
papacy. As many as 600,000 people are expected to turn out. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's schedule includes a youth rally, a fitting event because  
the pope is counting on young Catholics to battle what he calls a 
``culture of death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 78-year-old pontiff used his five-day Mexico visit to  
outline church strategy throughout the Americas for the start of 
the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed a declaration containing that strategy. It also  
condemned the evils of exploitative capitalism, abortion, 
euthanasia and capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged Catholics to more vigorously defend their faith against  
Protestant sects that have made inroads in Latin America, and he 
stressed the need to preach to both rich and poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the strategy involves bringing civic leaders back into  
contact with the church. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the stadium crowd in Mexico that the Catholic faith,  
``lived daily by so many believers, will enliven and inspire the 
programs needed to overcome'' crises confronting humanity, such as 
corruption, drugs and unbridled consumerism. 
</P>
<P>
	But perhaps just as importantly, the pope renewed his  
relationship with Mexicans, whom he has adored -- and who have 
adored him -- since the first trip of his papacy in 1979. He has 
visited three times since. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like a Mexican,'' he told the cheering crowd in a  
celebration that was broadcast to cities throughout the Americas.

<HEADLINE> UConn: 18-0 and in a Lull </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The No. 1 team in the country is in a  
mini-slump, yet its record remains perfect. The toughest part of 
the schedule is ahead, but there's a nice break to get ready for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	All things considered, Jim Calhoun can't complain a whole lot  
about his Connecticut Huskies. He sees the glass as both half-empty 
and half-full, and right now he likes the half-full view best. 
</P>
<P>
	``My team right now is going through a lull,'' Calhoun said  
after Monday night's 78-71 victory at Georgetown. ``They've been 
going through a lull for two weeks. During that time, we haven't 
lost a game. We have to be happy with that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're tired, mentally and physically. We've played  
three games in six days. We've trailed at halftime the last three 
games. Usually that's a bad sign. We've won the last three games, 
that's a good sign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut (18-0, 10-0 Big East) needed overtime to win at  
Miami and rallied at home against Seton Hall before surviving a 
physical test against Georgetown (9-10, 2-8). The Hoyas had a 
six-point lead early in the second half before the more talented 
Huskies duo of Richard Hamilton and Khalid El-Amin and their 
supporting cast slowly, but inevitably, turned the tide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hamilton got real aggressive, Khalid got real aggressive, when  
they sensed that they had a chance to win the game,'' Georgetown 
coach Craig Esherick said. ``And they won the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even the top team in the country can dig itself out of a  
halftime hole only so many times, and it certainly won't be easy if 
the Huskies trail after 20 minutes in any of their next three 
games: at No. 9 St. John's on Saturday, home to No. 17 Syracuse on 
Monday, then across country to No. 3 Stanford on Feb. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three easy games coming up,'' Calhoun chuckled. ``Two of those  
on the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun gave his players off Tuesday and may do the same  
Wednesday. Three of them especially need the rest: El-Amin's 
hamstring acted up again late in the Georgetown game, Ricky Moore 
needs treatment for an Achilles tendon injury, and Edmund Saunders 
has a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that the Huskies are winning without playing their best  
is a usual sign of a championship contender, but Calhoun said he 
still doesn't think he's got the best team in the country. It's 
another topic with two perspectives, and once again the coached 
ended on the positive one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we're a great team, but I think we're a very,  
very good team,'' Calhoun said. ``And when you come down to any 
particular game, we're pretty tough to beat.''

<HEADLINE> Holocaust Heir Can Sue for Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The heir of a Holocaust victim can sue a  
European insurance company in California for not honoring a life 
insurance policy at the end of World War II, a judge ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was a major step in Adolf Stern's attempt to  
collect from policies bought in 1929 by his brother, Moshe ``Mor'' 
Stern, who was killed in a Nazi death camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Adolf Stern and his family have tried to collect at least a  
dozen times since 1945. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge Florence-Marie Cooper ruled Monday that the  
company, Assicurazioni Generali, had adequate business ties to 
California to justify a lawsuit in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling could affect more than 6,000 Nazi Holocaust survivors  
who live in California, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
	Generali lawyers had argued that the lawsuit should be filed in  
the Czech Republic, because the policy had been bought in Prague. 
But the judge noted that the company has owned a California 
subsidiary, filed lawsuits here and sold $27 million in insurance 
here in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it would appeal the ruling, saying the claims  
were denied because the postwar communist government of 
Czechoslovakia seized all the company's assets.

<HEADLINE> Health Benefits Costs Seen Up 9 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After years of steady growth, the proportion of  
workers joining health maintenance organizations fell in 1998 as 
employees switched to more flexible plans, according to a new 
employer survey. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too early to tell whether the decline in HMO enrollment  
is a short-term phenomenon or more ominously a sign that these 
managed care plans may not be the centerpiece of the nation's 
health care delivery system after all,'' said Blaine Bos, a 
consultant for William M. Mercer, the employee benefits firm which 
conducted the study. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mercer survey of nearly 4,200 employers, released Monday,  
found that enrollment in HMOs, and HMO point-of-service plans -- 
plans that give some out of network coverage -- dropped to 47 
percent in 1998 from 50 percent the prior year. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, preferred provider organizations grew from 35  
percent to 40 percent in 1998. PPOs are a less restrictive form of 
managed care in which consumers pay less if they use doctors in the 
network, but they don't have to. Unlike HMOs, PPOs do not require 
consumers to visit their primary care doctor before seeing 
specialists. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are moving into a PPO so not to have to deal with a  
gatekeeper,'' Bos said. 
</P>
<P>
	PPOs have grown steadily in the past five years, rising from 27  
percent of employees in 1993. Traditional insurance has dropped 
from 48 percent of employees in 1993 to 13 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also found that most employers expect the cost of  
providing health benefits for workers will rise 9 percent this 
year, the biggest increase in seven years. In 1998, health benefits 
costs rose 6.1 percent, Mercer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers blamed the increases on rising premiums charged by  
health plans and skyrocketing drug costs. To deal with rising 
costs, employers are continuing to drop coverage for retirees and 
are reducing drug benefits for some active workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the percentage of companies with 500 or more workers  
providing health benefits retirees over age 65 fell to 36 percent, 
down from 46 percent in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	As for active workers, about one-third of employers said they  
cut prescription drug benefits, either by reducing choice of 
certain drugs or asking workers to pick up a higher share of the 
costs. In come cases, workers have been paying higher 
``co-payments'' on each prescription they buy. Co-payments that 
used to average $5 or $10 per prescription can now be as high as 
$20 or even $40. 
</P>
<P>
	Underlying the higher benefit costs is the fact that health  
plans are facing a profit squeeze due to their inability to pull 
the reins in on rising health costs. Those plans are now passing on 
their higher costs to employers, and this, in turn affects 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mercer study found the average health benefit cost per  
employee was $4,164 last year, the first time it topped $4,000. The 
average cost varied widely, from a low of $3,438 in the South to 
$4,340 per employee in the Northeast, the study found. The regional 
differences were attributed to the impact of health maintenance 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	HMOs require that patients choose doctors only from those in a  
network of physicians who have agreed to accept lower fees. HMOs 
closely monitor care and require that a primary care physician 
approve all care by specialists. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found costs rising in all three major types of health  
plans-- HMOs, preferred provider organizations and traditional 
health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mercer survey covered employers with 10 or more workers. It  
was conducted by mail and had a margin of error of plus or minus 2 
percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Players Talk Up Super Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- He wore a black leather dog collar with silver  
studs. The only thing missing was a muzzle. 
</P>
<P>
	And so Ray Buchanan talked. And he talked. And he talked.  
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Broncos and Atlanta Falcons didn't practice Tuesday --  
who needs to practice five days before the Super Bowl? -- so players 
exercised their jaws instead at media day. A pair of motormouths 
took charge: Buchanan for the Atlanta Falcons, Shannon Sharpe for 
the Denver Broncos, 60 minutes apiece before a cluster of 
microphones and notepads at Pro Player Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The two talked to a draw. Sharpe displayed a wit worthy of his  
name, but Buchanan's collar also made a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The neckwear is for the media, because everybody calls us  
underdogs,'' said Buchanan, a 27-year-old Pro Bowl cornerback. 
``It's actually a dog collar. I bought it at a pet store. They put 
it on Rottweilers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Remember meek Wally Cox, the voice of the 1960s TV cartoon  
character Underdog? Buchanan sounded nothing like that. He stood by 
his guarantee of a Falcons victory over the Broncos, deftly 
answered questions from a Comedy Central reporter (``Are you 
housebroken?'') and waxed hyperbolic in the best Super Bowl 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Super Bowl is big,'' he said. ``It's bigger than life  
itself sometimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe was forced to follow Buchanan's breathtaking performance,  
but Sharpe barely pauses for breath anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've pretty much lived in Georgia my whole life, and I never  
liked the Falcons,'' said the Pro Bowl tight end, a native of 
Glennville, Ga., who played at Savannah State College. ``What was 
there to like about them? They lost all the time. If you had a pair 
of cleats on, they'd put you in the ballgame, they were getting 
beat so bad. For $20 you could sit in the luxury box with the 
owner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Buchanan, Sharpe refused to risk putting his foot in his  
mouth with a victory guarantee. Buchanan's team is a seven-point 
underdog against the defending Super Bowl champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not an underdog anymore, because he went out on a limb  
and guaranteed a victory,'' Sharpe said. ``He has the luxury of 
saying, `I guarantee a win,' and if they lose, so what? No one 
expected them to win anyway. Whereas if I were to say, `I guarantee 
the Broncos are going to beat the Falcons,' what an idiot Shannon 
looks like if the Broncos lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan's pledge comes 30 years after the New York Jets  
fulfilled Broadway Joe Namath's guarantee of an upset victory in 
Miami in the third Super Bowl. The Falcons are amused by the stir 
their cornerback created, and coach Dan Reeves has begun referring 
to Buchanan as Broadway Ray. 
</P>
<P>
	But now that Buchanan finds himself in the Super Bowl spotlight,  
repeatedly answering questions about the guarantee, he realizes he 
may have spoken too boldly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know it was going to be such a big deal,'' he said,  
``but I'm not going to back down from a fight. The guarantee is 
about the fact that we believe in ourselves and we have enough 
faith in God to have blessed us to get to this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan emerged only recently as a mouthpiece for Atlanta. He  
spent his first four NFL seasons in Indianapolis, then signed with 
the Falcons following their 3-13 season in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody ever hear of Ray Buchanan before he got to Atlanta?''  
Sharpe asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe, meanwhile, became the voice of the Broncos soon after  
they made him a seventh-round draft pick in 1990. As a rookie, he 
admits he did more talking than playing. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Sharpe has become the first NFL tight end to catch at least  
50 passes in seven consecutive seasons. Not surprisingly, he ranks 
himself among the best of all time. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at Ozzie Newsome and Kellen Winslow, none of those  
guys ever played in a Super Bowl,'' said Sharpe, 30. ``Here I am in 
my second one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe anticipates some trash-talking Sunday with Buchanan, and  
in that matchup, he guarantees a victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the best trash-talker in the game,'' Sharpe said. ``I'm  
always going to have the last word.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not this time.  
</P>
<P>
	``Talk,'' Buchanan said, ``is cheap.''

<HEADLINE> NBC Scores Weekly Ratings Victory / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Who needs Michael Jordan? NBC has just scored  
its highest weekly Nielsen Media Research ratings since last June, 
when it was broadcasting Jordan's swan song in the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Golden Globe Awards show and the countdown to  
George Clooney's departure from ``ER'' led NBC to a 10.4 rating and 
17 share, Nielsen said Tuesday. CBS was a distant second with an 
8.8 rating and 14 share. ABC, with a 6.8 and 11, and Fox, with a 
6.7 and 11, both struggled. 
</P>
<P>
	``ER'' was easily the week's most-watched show, solidifying its  
lead over ``Friends'' in the competition for the season's 
top-ranked series. NBC is promoting Clooney's upcoming exit, 
expected during next month's ratings ``sweeps'' period. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's Golden Globes telecast had a 16.1 rating, its best ever  
and a pleasant surprise for NBC, which has broadcast the show for 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
	The show's previous record was 15.9, achieved last year and in  
1981 on CBS. Last year's telecast was buoyed by interest in 
``Titanic,'' and NBC executives had anticipated the ratings would 
slip this year. Instead, the awards show is becoming a major stop 
on the way to the Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
	The end of ``Monday Night Football'' on ABC is setting up a  
strong battle for viewers. CBS's comedies ``Everybody Loves 
Raymond'' and ``Becker'' both scored top 10 Nielsen finishes last 
week, and so did their Fox competition, ``Ally McBeal.'' ABC's 
rating last week was well below its season average. 
</P>
<P>
	The developing networks were helped by showing entertainment  
programs during President Clinton's State of the Union address. The 
WB had a 3.6 rating and 6, UPN had a 2.1 rating and 3 share and Pax 
TV was at 0.8 and 1. All were above their season averages. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' and ABC's ``World News Tonight'' tied in  
the evening news competition with 8.6 ratings and 16 shares. The 
``CBS Evening News'' had a 7.8 rating and 15 share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. Share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Jan. 18-24, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were ``ER,'' NBC, 21.3; ``Friends,'' NBC, 16.8; 
``Frasier,'' 16.5; ``Golden Globe Awards,'' NBC, 16.1; ``Jesse,'' 
NBC, 14.4; ``Veronica's Closet,'' NBC, 14.2; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 
13.5; ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' CBS, 12.5; ``Becker,'' CBS, 
11.2; ``Ally McBeal,'' Fox, 11.1.

<HEADLINE>  St. Louis Turns Out for Pope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- This city is almost giddy preparing for Pope  
John Paul II's two-day stopover in America's heartland. 
</P>
<P>
	Banners welcoming the pontiff hang from buildings and  
drive-through hamburger spots, even funeral homes. Special papal 
greeting cloths have been made for visitors to wave along parade 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
	By late this morning, thousands of people with folding chairs,  
blankets and strollers had gathered in the city's Central West End 
along the route of the first of three scheduled parades. 
</P>
<P>
	The city for months has been preparing for the first visit by  
any pope to St. Louis, the nation's 18th largest city. Workers have 
logged long hours distributing tickets, setting up venues and 
organizing the entertainment for the visit that was to begin today. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be a fantastic trip,'' said Kim Carter of  
Knoxville, Tenn., who arrived Sunday with her husband and three 
children. ``I'm very excited to see the pope. I want to see him. I 
want to revitalize our faith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of nuns around the area -- at the request of the St.  
Louis Archdiocese -- have prayed for what organizers can't control: 
nice weather for a visit that will draw President Clinton to St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The weather will not matter to a group of Catholic youths who  
drove 12 hours from Grand Rapids, Minn. The 47 teens from St. 
Joseph's Church volunteered to direct buses at the events. In 
return, they received tickets to each of the events. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a once in a lifetime chance,'' said Wendy Kraa, 13.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a way to get closer to God,'' chimed in Laural Davern,  
14. ``We prayed with our families. We've done a lot of praying. 
It's going to be great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers expect this city of some 400,000 to be swamped by as  
many as 600,000 out-of-towners eager to snap up papal T-shirts, key 
rings, rosaries, mugs and John Paul II teddy bears. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Regional Commerce &AMP; Growth Association has  
estimated that the visit could pump up to $25 million into the 
local economy. Tourists alone were expected to spend $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope's visit could attract crowds that may even surpass the  
700,000 who welcomed Charles Lindbergh back home a few weeks after 
his record flight from New York to Paris in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope, of course, has his critics. The Catholic Women for  
Justice staged a Monday evening candlelight prayer service calling 
for full participation of women in the church. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope's 31-hour visit includes three large indoor events: a  
youth rally at the Kiel Center, a Mass involving an estimated 
100,000 people at the Trans World Dome, and a prayer service at the 
St. Louis Cathedral Basilica. 
</P>
<P>
	There are also four major outdoor events: a youth march from the  
Gateway Arch to the Kiel Center rally, and three parades. 
</P>
<P>
	Boxes of paper plates, napkins and plastic silverware sat in the  
corner at the Key West Cafe, near the six-block area dubbed the 
Papal Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurant was to open five hours early today to serve  
breakfast to an estimated 1,000 people. It will do the same 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We seat 80,'' owner Thomas Burnham said. ``It's easy for us to  
do if we can plan for it. And we've had plenty of time to get 
ready.''

<HEADLINE> Axel Schulz Knocked Off Tyson List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ten days after Francois Botha was knocked out by  
Mike Tyson, Axel Schulz on Tuesday was knocked off the list of 
prospective opponents for Tyson's next fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilfred Sauerland, Schulz's manager, said in Frankfurt, Germany,  
that Showtime, the cable network with a multiple-fight deal with 
Tyson, was not interested in the German heavyweight fighting Tyson 
April 24 in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the end of all dreams,'' said Sauerland, noting a fight  
contract had been drawn up and had been ready to sign. ``The 
subject is closed. Axel is very disappointed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying he's in or out,'' said Jay Larkin, who runs  
boxing for Showtime and SET, its pay-per-view arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Larkin, however, also said, ``It would be very difficult for us  
to sell Mike Tyson against a guy who lost to the guy he just beat. 
And, Schulz in not exactly a household word in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Botha, knocked out in the fifth round by Tyson Jan. 16,  
outpointed Schulz for the vacant IBF title Dec. 9, 1995, at 
Stuttgart, Germany. Schulz has not fought in the United States 
since he lost a decision to George Foreman April 22, 1995, in a 
bout preceding his loss to Botha. 
</P>
<P>
	Larkin said others being considered for the next fight in  
Tyson's latest comeback included Michael Moorer, former IBF 
champion; Lou Savarese, who knocked out former champion James 
``Buster'' Douglas in the first round and lost a decision to 
Foreman; Shannon Briggs, who beat Foreman on a controversial 
decision; Herbie Hide, the WBO champion from Britain, and Brian 
Nielsen of Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
	Larkin said Donovan ``Razor'' Ruddock, who has lost twice to  
Tyson, was not on the list. 
</P>
<P>
	Sauerland said Showtime concerned about lower than expected  
income from Tyson's pay-per-view fight against Botha. 
</P>
<P>
	Larkin, however, said, ``From Showtime's standpoint it did fine.  
There were about 750,000 buys on cable and satellite (averaging 
$45), making it the most successful pay-per-view event in the last 
20 months. But Tyson is only measured by his own past success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Botha fight in the MGM Grand Garden at Las Vegas was Tyson's  
first since he bit Evander Holyfield's ears and was disqualified 
June 28, 1997. The April 24 fight also will be a pay-per-view match 
in the Grand Garden.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Rejuvenates Sanction Weapon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, under pressure to  
curb a skyrocketing trade deficit, announced it is reviving a 
controversial procedure to impose stiff economic sanctions on 
countries judged to have erected the most offensive trade barriers 
to American exports. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky told the Senate  
Finance Committee on Tuesday that President Clinton will issue an 
executive order re-instituting ``Super 301,'' a process in which 
the United States singles out countries for intensive negotiations 
which ultimately can lead to sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has used Super 301 in the past to force trade  
concessions from other countries, most recently last October when 
South Korea agreed to remove a series of barriers to American 
automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
	But many foreign nations view these forced negotiations as  
bullying by America. They would rather have a neutral body, the 
Geneva-based World Trade Organization, settle trade disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	Barshefsky said the Super 301 review will begin with the March  
31 release of the annual National Trade Estimate Report which 
provides a country-by-country review of trade barriers faced by 
U.S. exporters. A month later the administration will release a 
list of targeted countries, kicking off 90 days of intense 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	If those talks don't produce agreement, the administration will  
begin formal investigations that, after a year, could result in 
trade sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Barshefksy said the president will also use his executive powers  
to reinstitute annual reviews of foreign government procurement 
practices that discriminate against American companies, using the 
same time table as the Super 301 provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators put heavy pressure on Barshefsky, Treasury Secretary  
Robert Rubin and Commerce Secretary William Daley to demonstrate 
new toughness on trade in light of America's soaring trade deficit. 
The deficit was running at an annual rate of $168 billion last year 
and is expected to widen by another $50 billion to $60 billion this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	These deficits are a result of the 18-month old global currency  
crisis, which has pushed Russia and many Asian nations into deep 
recessions, cutting export opportunities for American companies and 
resulting in a flood of imports into the still prosperous U.S. 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin told the Senate panel that U.S. efforts to close its giant  
market could hurt recovery efforts in troubled economies overseas 
and set a dangerous precedent. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the United States, with its healthy economy, is seen as  
moving toward restricting markets, that could well reinforce the 
newly vibrant forces of protectionism in many countries around the 
world ... and that is enormously against our economic interest,'' 
Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	His comments drew a rebuke from Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va.,  
who said he was afraid Rubin ``has a grip over the president's mind 
when it comes to trade matters'' that is preventing the 
administration from moving forcefully to protect the U.S. steel 
industry. Rockefeller said that industry could be forced to lay off 
80,000 workers later this year if a flood of cheap steel imports is 
not curbed. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has been stymied for four years in efforts to  
get Congress to renew the president's trade negotiating authority, 
known as fast track, that he needs to enter into new trade 
agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor unions and environmental groups have blocked approval in  
the House, arguing that U.S. trade policy needs to put much greater 
emphasis on protecting the environment and workers' rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., said he  
hopes to use upcoming hearings to rebuild a bipartisan consensus in 
hopes of approving fast track legislation this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But given current positions, that will be a big challenge.

<HEADLINE>  Pope Compares Abortion to Slavery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Pope John Paul II paid a visit Tuesday to  
America's heartland, where he decried teen suicide and despair and 
likened the legal battle over abortion and euthanasia to the clash 
over slavery on the eve of the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is something terribly wrong when so many people are  
overcome by hopelessness to the point of taking their own lives,'' 
the pope said at a youth rally at the Kiel Center, where his somber 
message stood in stark contrast to the rock-star welcome he got 
from the jubilant crowd of 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``Remember: Christ is calling you; the Church needs  
you; the Pope believes in you and he expects great things of you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul, making his fifth trip to the U.S. mainland, arrived  
in St. Louis for a 30-hour stay after a triumphant, five-day visit 
to Mexico City. President Clinton and the first lady joined 500 
families at a sweltering National Guard hangar at Lambert Airport 
to welcome the pope. 
</P>
<P>
	The pontiff later met privately with the president.  
</P>
<P>
	``For 20 years you have challenged us to think of life not in  
terms of what we acquire for ourselves but what we give of 
ourselves,'' the president told John Paul at the airport ceremony. 
``We honor you for standing for human dignity and human rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 78-year-old pope's arm shook as he held the lectern, his  
body stooped over his text. Still, his voice was firm. 
</P>
<P>
	He reminded Americans of the Dred Scott case, tried in St.  
Louis. Scott, a slave bought in 1833 by an Army surgeon stationed 
near St. Louis, sued for his freedom. Living in a free state, he 
said, made him a free man. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1857, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, in effect, that slaves  
were property and not citizens -- a decision, the pope said, that 
declared ``an entire class of human beings -- people of African 
descent -- outside the boundaries of the national community and the 
Constitution's protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Today,'' the pope went on, ``the conflict is between a culture  
that affirms, cherishes, and celebrates the gift of life, and a 
culture that seeks to declare entire groups of human beings -- the 
unborn, the terminally ill, the handicapped, and others considered 
`unuseful' -- to be outside the boundaries of legal protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, John Paul is scheduled to celebrate Mass before  
104,000 people at the Trans World Dome. 
</P>
<P>
	Altogether, as many as 600,000 people are expected to turn out  
to see the pope in St. Louis. More than 530,000 Roman Catholics 
live in and around the city, which was founded by French Catholics 
in 1764. John Paul came to town at the invitation of Archbishop 
Justin Rigali, a longtime friend. 
</P>
<P>
	At the youth rally, he was showered with adulation from young  
people weeping, squealing, jumping up and down and waving 
handkerchiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is incredible. It's probably the biggest thing I've ever  
been to,'' said Sarah Einhorn, 14, of Effingham, Ill. ``He's just 
an incredible role model, someone you can really look up to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Noting the excitement in St. Louis during the home run race  
btween Sammy Sosa and hometown hero Mark McGwire, the pope told the 
young people: ``You can feel the same great enthusiasm as you train 
for a different goal -- the goal of following Christ, the goal of 
bringing his message to the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turning more serious, he said that ``sometimes the world seems  
filled with darkness'' from hunger, violence, homelessness, 
unemployment and drugs. ``God's gift of life is being rejected. 
Death is chosen over life and this brings the darkness of 
despair,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	During previous visits to the United States, home to 62 million  
Roman Catholics, the pope has spoken out against American 
materialism and consumerism. 
</P>
<P>
	At the airport Tuesday, John Paul avoided certain sources of  
tension with the United States and dropped from the advance text of 
his speech any mention of land mines, drug trafficking or U.S. 
airstrikes against Iraq, something the Vatican has assailed as 
``aggression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the 20-minute meeting between Clinton and the pope,  
abortion only ``came up in passing'' and the Monica Lewinsky affair 
not at all, White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said. The two did 
discuss Cuba and Iraq, papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope is also a foe of capital punishment and has intervened  
in several cases in the United States. Missouri's Supreme Court, 
without explanation, postponed an execution that was to have taken 
place while the pope was in town. Navarro-Valls called the 
postponement ``a mockery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the airport reception, thousands of people hoping for a  
glimpse of the pontiff in his Popemobile lined the route of the 
papal motorcade as it made its way from the airport to St. Louis 
Cathedral. As the pope drew near, crowds sitting on hills rushed 
toward the temporary fences, cheering, waving banners and chanting, 
``John Paul II, we love you!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Margaret Wilson, 81, sat in a folding chair for six hours at a  
spot along the route. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't imagine I'd ever get this close to the pope,'' she  
said. ``I'm glad I've lived long enough so I could see this.'' She 
added: ``First we had McGwire hitting all those home runs. Now we 
have the pope. I don't know what we're going to do for excitement 
after this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Mexico last week, the pope signed a declaration setting out  
the church's goals in the Americas for the new millennium. It 
condemned exploitative capitalism, drug trafficking, corruption and 
``the culture of death'' -- abortion, euthanasia and capital 
punishment. He also said the church must try harder to reach the 
rich and powerful, not just the poor.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky: Risks if She Testifies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The last thing Monica Lewinsky wants to do is  
give House prosecutors dramatic new information for their case 
against President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	She would risk losing her immunity from prosecution if she  
changed her story about her relationship with the president, 
lawyers say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her entire immunity agreement is dependent on her having told  
the truth the first time,'' Philadelphia lawyer Lawrence Fox said 
in an interview Monday. ``She obviously has this sword hanging over 
her head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago lawyer Howard Pearl said Lewinsky's immunity agreement  
is ``very specifically on the line,'' as underscored by last 
weekend's federal court order that cited the agreement in requiring 
her to submit to an interview by House prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky met with three House prosecutors for almost two  
hours Sunday as they sought information to jump-start their bid to 
oust Clinton for what he did to hide his affair with the former 
White House intern. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward the prosecutors pronounced the meeting productive.  
Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., said Ms. Lewinsky ``might be a very 
helpful witness to the Senate if called.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But her lawyers hope the Senate will decide not to call her as a  
witness or seek a sworn statement from her. 
</P>
<P>
	Following Sunday's interview, her lawyer, Plato Cacheris, said  
she ``added nothing to the record that is already sitting before 
the Senate right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's other attorney, Jacob Stein, said Monday she  
fully cooperated with House prosecutors but wants to avoid 
testifying in the Senate. ``She now has a compelling personal 
interest in avoiding her use by others into what cannot be anything 
but an unseemly circus,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That compelling interest, other lawyers said, is avoiding the  
risk of saying something that might lead Independent Counsel 
Kenneth Starr to try to revoke her immunity agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Last July, Ms. Lewinsky promised to testify before a federal  
grand jury or any ``congressional proceedings'' such as an 
impeachment trial. In exchange, Starr promised not to prosecute Ms. 
Lewinsky over her testimony or her affidavit in which she denied an 
affair with the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr can ask a court to cancel the immunity agreement if it  
determines Ms. Lewinsky ``has intentionally given false, incomplete 
or misleading information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That agreement gives Ms. Lewinsky an incentive to stay close to  
her prior testimony in the case, lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington lawyer Barbara Nicastro, a former federal prosecutor,  
said that to avoid trouble, Ms. Lewinsky needs to ``keep her story 
straight and tell the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If she remembers something differently, Nicastro said, she'd  
better have a ``good explanation why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York lawyer Gregory Joseph said Ms. Lewinsky could add new  
information as long as it was consistent with her earlier 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody expects her to use the exact words,'' Joseph said, but  
he added, ``She cannot vary in any meaningful way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox said her lawyers likely would go over her previous testimony  
with her so it would be fresh in her mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as she's got the immunity agreement she's in great  
shape,'' Fox said. But he added, ``Every time you open your mouth 
you put yourself at a little bit of risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pearl, a former federal prosecutor, said Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers  
could ask the Senate for a separate grant of immunity, either to 
make doubly certain of her protection for Senate testimony or 
simply to create one more obstacle to calling her as a witness. 
</P>
<P>
	``The harder they make the road ... the better'' for their  
effort to keep Ms. Lewinsky from testifying, Pearl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, legal sources reported today that Ms. Lewinsky's  
lawyers have asked U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson to 
permit the former White House intern to be interviewed by Barbara 
Walters for ABC's ``20/20'' program. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of her immunity agreement with Starr, Ms.  
Lewinsky is not permitted to comment to the news media without 
Starr's approval, ``pending the resolution of this matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewinsky lawyers are seeking a court hearing Thursday to  
force Starr to lift the restrictions, said the legal sources, 
speaking on condition of anonymity.

<HEADLINE> Jones Won't Object To Mediator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Paula Jones has no objection to a  
mediator working to resolve a dispute over how the $850,000 
settlement from President Clinton is divided among lawyers who 
worked on the case, according to court papers filed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	After lawyers for Clinton and Mrs. Jones agreed on the  
settlement, two lawyers who handled the earlier stages of her case, 
Joseph Cammarata and Gilbert Davis, filed a claim for $875,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones' lawyers who had the case when it was thrown out and  
subsequently settled -- the Dallas firm, Radar, Campbell, Fisher and 
Pyke -- filed court papers earlier this month asking a federal judge 
to refer their dispute to a magistrate to mediate how they should 
divide the $850,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones has no objection to the check being deposited with  
the court until the dispute is over, according to Gregory S. 
Kitterman of Little Rock, another lawyer hired to represent her in 
the pay dispute who filed new documents on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The check had been uncashed because of the disagreements.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Diane Sawyer and Charles Gibson pulled in  
viewers during their first week as hosts of ABC's struggling ``Good 
Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen ratings for the duo's debut week were 25 percent higher  
than the show's average numbers during the last three months of 
1998. Sawyer and Gibson had 4.2 million viewers on their first day, 
and the audience declined only slightly the rest of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Today'' show had an average 6.1 million viewers last  
week and ``GMA'' had 4.1 million. CBS's ``This Morning'' had an 
average of 3 million viewers, Nielsen Media Research said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sawyer and Gibson replaced Lisa McRee and Kevin Newman on Jan.  
18, after ratings declined during the previous duo's tenure. The 
reign of Sawyer and Gibson was announced as temporary but 
indefinite.

<HEADLINE>  Pope Compares Abortion to Slavery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Pope John Paul II paid a visit Tuesday to  
America's heartland, where he decried teen suicide and despair and 
likened the legal battle over abortion and euthanasia to the clash 
over slavery on the eve of the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is something terribly wrong when so many people are  
overcome by hopelessness to the point of taking their own lives,'' 
the pope said at a youth rally at the Kiel Center, where his somber 
message stood in stark contrast to the rock-star welcome he got 
from the jubilant crowd of 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``Remember: Christ is calling you; the Church needs  
you; the Pope believes in you and he expects great things of you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul, making his fifth trip to the U.S. mainland, arrived  
in St. Louis for a 30-hour stay after a triumphant, five-day visit 
to Mexico City. President Clinton and the first lady joined 500 
families at a sweltering National Guard hangar at Lambert Airport 
to welcome the pope. 
</P>
<P>
	The pontiff later met privately with the president.  
</P>
<P>
	``For 20 years you have challenged us to think of life not in  
terms of what we acquire for ourselves but what we give of 
ourselves,'' the president told John Paul at the airport ceremony. 
``We honor you for standing for human dignity and human rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 78-year-old pope's arm shook as he held the lectern, his  
body stooped over his text. Still, his voice was firm. 
</P>
<P>
	He reminded Americans of the Dred Scott case, tried in St.  
Louis. Scott, a slave bought in 1833 by an Army surgeon stationed 
near St. Louis, sued for his freedom. Living in a free state, he 
said, made him a free man.

that affirms, cherishes, and celebrates the gift of life, and a 
culture that seeks to declare entire groups of human beings -- the 
unborn, the terminally ill, the handicapped, and others considered 
`unuseful' -- to be outside the boundaries of legal protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, John Paul is scheduled to celebrate Mass before  
104,000 people at the Trans World Dome. 
</P>
<P>
	Altogether, as many as 600,000 people are expected to turn out

<HEADLINE> Phil Simms' Son Will Attend Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Phillip Fulmer and national champion  
Tennessee finally lost one -- a recruit that is. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Simms, son of former New York Giants quarterback Phil  
Simms, changed his mind and decided to attend Texas instead of 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no ifs, ands, or buts about it, I'm going to  
Texas,'' Simms said in today's editions of The Record of 
Hackensack, confirming what his high school coach said on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The surprise switch came more than a month after a mid-December  
announcement that Simms would join the Volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had some time over the last few weeks to reflect and think  
about it before he made it final, and he weighed it out in his mind 
and he just felt Texas was a better fit for him,'' said Mike 
Miello, Simms' coach at Ramapo (N.J.) High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas and Penn State were the other finalists in the recruiting  
battle for the left-handed quarterback considered among the top 
prep players in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Simms' choice will not become official until he signs a national  
letter of intent on Feb. 3, the first day high school players are 
permitted to sign with a school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took more of a hard feeling about it,'' added Simms, who  
threw for more that 7,000 yards in 39 high school games. ``And I 
think I placed too much emphasis on playing time instead of what I 
like more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Simms seemed happy when he appeared on a local cable  
TV show to announce he would be attending Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud to be a Vol and it's a good place for me,'' Simms  
said at the time. ``I'm a big fan of Coach Fulmer and I think it 
fits me right. I feel so relieved and finally I can get back to 
being a high schooler and enjoying myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee won the national title a few weeks later, beating  
Florida State in the Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Tee Martin returns at quarterback for Tennessee, but Simms may  
have wavered when A.J. Suggs, another top quarterback prospect from 
Georgia, also verbally committed to the Vols. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas, meanwhile, has Major Applewhite returning for the next  
few seasons, but Simms could move up quickly since the Longhorns 
lack depth at quarterback, especially after redshirt freshman Greg 
Cicero transferred to a junior college in California. 
</P>
<P>
	A 6-foot-5, 218-pounder, Simms threw for 7,055 yards and 63  
touchdowns during his high school career. He threw for 18 
touchdowns with only four interceptions in his senior season.

<HEADLINE> FAA Sets Up Super Bowl Control Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Five federal employees are going to have a  
bird's-eye view of the Super Bowl this weekend, and they're not 
even going to have to use a vacation day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration will erect a temporary  
control tower to oversee the more than 475 helicopters, blimps and 
sign-draggers expected to buzz around Pro Player Stadium in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Five air traffic controllers armed with binoculars and two-way  
radios will staff the tower on Saturday and Sunday. It will be 
located atop the stadium's northeast corner, occupying what would 
normally be 10 rows of seats. 
</P>
<P>
	The 8-foot-by-10-foot structure won't have working radar, but  
the controllers will be able to talk with the tower at Miami 
International Airport -- where they normally work. They will direct 
aircraft within a one-mile radius of the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``The use of aviation at special events has immensely increased  
over the years,'' said Wayne Boggs, manager of the temporary tower. 
``FAA, in partnership with the National Football League, identified 
a need to increase the service and enhance safety for the users and 
all of the fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL, in fact, requested the tower and will pay the $6,000  
bill to operate it. It became concerned about air traffic control 
during last year's Super Bowl in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only are there news helicopters and blimps to provide aerial  
TV shots, but many celebrities and corporate VIPs attending the 
game arrive by helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots who will be operating around the stadium this weekend  
have to attend a special FAA briefing and sign a letter agreeing to 
the rules. Blimps will fly at 1,700 feet, banner planes at 1,200 
feet and helicopters must take off and land at two designated 
helipads. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA has previously created temporary control towers for  
events such as the Masters golf tournament, but they have never 
been on site. Instead, they have been located at nearby airports 
that do not have their own towers.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Exec Denies Making Remark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The most senior Microsoft executive who will  
testify at his company's antitrust trial denied to the government 
that he ever uttered an often-quoted phrase about his company's 
aggression toward a rival, that he once promised to ``cut off 
Netscape's air supply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sensational phrase, which underscores the government's  
antitrust case against Microsoft, was attributed by one witness to 
Paul Maritz during a November 1995 meeting with Intel Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its lawsuit, the government alleges that Microsoft  
included Internet browser software free within its dominant Windows 
operating system to try to ``crush'' Netscape, whose browser was 
much more popular during the mid-1990s and earned tens of millions 
of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	In a charge central to its case, the government contends that by  
flooding the market with its own free browser, Microsoft cut off 
Netscape's opportunity to earn profits on its software. 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz, though, flatly denied making the statements in written  
testimony submitted to the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never said, in the presence of Intel personnel or otherwise,  
that Microsoft would 'cut off Netscape's air supply,' or words to 
that effect,'' Maritz wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	But Justice Department lawyer David Boies confronted Maritz on  
Monday with his sworn statements from last year. Boies said they 
represent a far less adamant denial than Maritz's current 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's possible, but I just don't recall it,'' Maritz offered  
during earlier interviews with government lawyers. ``I don't 
believe it's something that I would have said.'' He added that he 
``would be skeptical'' if anyone attributed the comments directly 
to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning by Boies, Maritz said he recently reviewed the  
notes of three Intel executives at the 1995 meeting who did not 
remember the phrase. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe my testimony to be inconsistent then with what  
I am saying now,'' Maritz said calmly. 
</P>
<P>
	Another witness, Intel Vice President Steven McGeady, testified  
previously during the trial that Maritz and others from Microsoft 
met with executives in Oregon to discuss technology issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paul and some of the other attendees made some fairly colorful  
statements that stick out in my memory,'' McGeady testified. ``... 
It was Microsoft's plan to cut off Netscape's air supply. By giving 
away free browsers, Microsoft was going to keep Netscape from 
getting off the ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boies quizzed Maritz on Monday about whether he ever complained  
to The New York Times, which ran a story in January 1998 based on 
an anonymous interview with McGeady attributing the phrase to 
Maritz. 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz answered: ``Not to my knowledge.'' But he added that he  
was never named in the Times story and that, ``for a long time, it 
wasn't clear who at Microsoft would have said that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Times story clearly names Maritz, and Microsoft  
spokesman Mark Murray said later outside court that the company 
called to complain after the article was published. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft attorneys earlier confronted McGeady with his own  
notes about the disputed November 1995 meeting, which don't mention 
Maritz's alleged ``air supply'' comment. They also produced notes 
from two other Intel executives, who also didn't include it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The phrase was so far out of bounds with what I consider to be  
an acceptable business practice,'' McGeady testified. ``It stuck 
out clearly in my mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz, a group vice president at Microsoft, responsible for  
Microsoft's most important products, including its dominant Windows 
operating system and its profitable Office software programs.

<HEADLINE> `Big Play Ray' No Slouch With Mouth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Move over, Broadway Joe. The Super Bowl has a new  
prognosticator. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadway Ray.  
</P>
<P>
	Ray Buchanan, the Atlanta Falcons' Pro Bowl cornerback,  
guarantees a victory over the Denver Broncos, an appropriate way to 
mark the 30th anniversary of Joe Namath's landmark prediction prior 
to the third Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he claims to have been joking around when he made the  
statement to HBO's ``Inside the NFL,'' Buchanan didn't recant 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would never pick Denver to win,'' said Buchanan, who ranked  
second in the NFC with seven interceptions. ``If you're a 
competitive person ... you're always going to go into the game with 
confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Deion Sanders, Buchanan combines superior athletic skills  
with a steadfast arrogance that he's the best. When he looks across 
the line and sees someone like Randy Moss or Jerry Rice, not a bit 
of trepidation creeps into Buchanan's psyche. 
</P>
<P>
	He seemed to enjoy the attention Monday when besieged with media  
questions about his guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I said it, it was out of fun,'' Buchanan said. ``But once  
you get in the boxing ring, you're not going to back away from a 
fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's not even familiar with Namath's guarantee, which occurred  
2 1/2 years before Buchanan was born, in an era when trash-talking 
wasn't an accepted practice. Namath backed up his statement by 
guiding the New York Jets to a shocking 16-7 upset of the Baltimore 
Colts. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, a similar burden falls on Buchanan, though, quite frankly,  
he doesn't understand all the hoopla over saying he expects his 
team to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over on the Denver side, I'll bet they're guaranteeing a win,  
too,'' he said. ``They're just not being vocal about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Super Bowl-savvy Broncos were stunned that someone would  
actually go on record with such a bold prediction, no matter what 
the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are you crazy?'' defensive tackle Trevor Pryce said. ``To  
speak your mind and say you guarantee a win, that's a little 
deep.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Buchanan's teammates, they seem more bemused than upset  
about a teammate providing bulletin-board fodder for the Broncos. 
And coach Dan Reeves has started calling the cornerback ``Broadway 
Ray.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In life, there are no guarantees,'' linebacker Jessie Tuggle  
said. ``But it tells me how much confidence he has in our team. 
Obviously, Ray has a lot of confidence in himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan spoke with equal faith before the NFC championship game  
against Minnesota, viewing the Vikings' high-scoring offense with 
downright disdain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember vividly in the game when I came up to him and said,  
`Man, that Randy Moss cat is fast,''' said Michael Booker, who 
lines up at the opposite corner. ``Ray says, `He ain't that fast! I 
can take him!' I couldn't believe it. He really wanted to play 
Randy Moss man-to-man all over that field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan got his wish, working more and more against Moss after  
initially being paired with Cris Carter. The Vikings rookie managed 
only one catch for 4 yards after halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	That's just what the Falcons had in mind two years ago when they  
lured Buchanan away from the Indianapolis Colts with a four-year, 
$13 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves recognized right away that the secondary was the team's  
most pressing need when he was hired as coach. The Falcons 
surrendered an NFL record for passing yards in 1995 and had been 
looking for a decent coverage cornerback ever since Sanders left 
following the '93 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan allows the Falcons to be more flexible in their  
defensive schemes. They can bring strong safety William White 
closer to the line to help against the run. They can allow Robinson 
to float to Booker's side of the field, helping out the second-year 
cornerback who's still perfecting his coverage skills. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can cover anybody in this league one-on-one,'' defensive  
coordinator Rich Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan compensates for his lack of height -- he's only 5-foot-9  
-- by always seeming to be in the right position. 
</P>
<P>
	``His balance and body control is outstanding,'' Brooks said.  
``Once he sees what a receiver is going to do, he can plant and 
drive on it as quick as anybody in the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, on yeah, he's got the requisite bravado to play the  
position. 
</P>
<P>
	``He always goes out there with a sense of arrogance that he  
can't be beat,'' Booker said in admiration. ``And if he does get 
beat, he's going to come back and make a play right after that.''

<HEADLINE> Moody's Downgrades Automaker Mazda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service  
downgraded its ratings of Mazda Motor Corp.'s debt because the 
already struggling company is being hurt by continuing weakness in 
Japan's auto industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Moody's said the long-term unsecured debt rating for Mazda was  
downgraded to Ba1 from Baa3, moving the company's rating below 
investment grade. The agency also characterized the rating outlook 
for Mazda as negative. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower ratings signal increased risks for investors and tend to  
increase a company's borrowing costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Moody's said Japan's recession has placed an increasing burden  
on Mazda, which lost money in recent years but did turn a $70 
million profit in the first half of its current fiscal year due to 
cost cutting and favorable currency fluctuations. Moody's said the 
yen's recent strength against the dollar, combined with continued 
weakness in the domestic market, is likely to limit that earnings 
improvement to the short term. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Motor Co. owns 33.4 percent of Mazda since 1996, and has  
been active in sharing development costs and management with the 
company. However, Moody's noted, Ford does not want to assume 
Mazda's debt obligations, Moody's said.

<HEADLINE> Advanced Fibre Workers Face Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The Securities and Exchange Commission and  
the U.S. Attorney's Office have filed insider trading charges 
against two former employees of Advanced Fibre Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Named in the criminal indictment and civil complaint were  
Chi-lin Tom, 45, who was Advanced Fibre's director of design 
verification, and Hong Lu, 27, an engineer at the Petaluma-based 
telecommunications company. Hong Lu's wife, Yi Lu, 27, was also 
named in the civil complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint and indictment allege the employees netted  
$327,000 in illegal profits stemming from trading in Advanced Fibre 
options last June and July. 
</P>
<P>
	The criminal indictment, returned by a federal grand jury on  
Monday, charges each man with one count of conspiracy, one count of 
securities fraud and two counts of mail fraud. In addition, each 
man faces four counts of making false statements to the SEC, and 
one count of obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men pleaded innocent Tuesday and each was released on  
$50,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC's civil complaint alleges securities fraud based on  
illegal insider trading. It asks that the men give up profits and 
asks for civil penalties of up to three times the alleged profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a priority of this office to prosecute those who trade  
on inside information or who attempt to manipulate market values,'' 
said U.S. Attorney Robert S. Mueller III. ``Those in high-tech 
industries should know that, where appropriate, we will bring 
criminal charges against insiders who trade on nonpublic, 
confidential information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of the Petaluma-based Advanced Fibre fell 6 1/4 cents to  
$13.43 3/4 in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE>  Hit-Man Atwater Comes Up Big </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	big games  
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Haunted by the awful memory of the worst blowout  
loss in Super Bowl history, Steve Atwater had to wait eight long 
years to eradicate it. 
</P>
<P>
	A Denver Broncos rookie in 1989, Atwater endured a 55-10 defeat  
to the San Francisco 49ers in the Super Bowl and didn't get a shot 
at redemption until last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwater began to doubt that chance would ever come, as did  
teammate John Elway, who at least had the experience of previous, 
less lopsided Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	When the chance came, and the Broncos responded with a 31-24  
victory over the Green Bay Packers last January, it represented 
tremendous elation -- but mostly relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was huge,'' Atwater said Monday night. ``When you play in a  
game like that and you don't have success, it's one of those 
memories you want to get out of your mind. When you win, it's 
something you take with you for the rest of your life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, in their return trip to the Super Bowl, the Broncos have  
different concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more difficult to come in here as the defending  
champions,'' Atwater said. ``You're a little complacent and relaxed 
because you've been here before. It's something we have to guard 
against.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atwater, 32 and in his 10th season, knows he is a step slower  
and doesn't always hit with the ferocity he once did because of 
chronically sore shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season and again this season, he failed to post 100 tackles  
for the only times in his career, a sure sign that his body finally 
is beginning to wear down. 
</P>
<P>
	But he remains a force, especially in big games.  
</P>
<P>
	To many NFL observers, Atwater's play in last January's Super  
Bowl set a standard for free safeties. 
</P>
<P>
	He had six tackles, a sack, a forced fumble and two passes  
defensed. 
</P>
<P>
	His sack of Brett Favre caused a fumble that was recovered by  
Neil Smith, setting up a field goal for a 17-7 lead in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, he had one of the game's biggest pass breakups on a  
third-and-8 from the Broncos 39 early in the fourth quarter, 
knocking away a pass intended for Robert Brooks that would have 
given Green Bay a first down inside the 25 with the score tied 
24-24. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was able to get around the ball and make some plays,'' he  
said. ``That's all any player wants, an opportunity to make some 
plays. I'm hoping I can get the opportunity to get around the ball 
again this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not much difference in preparing for regular season  
games and playoff games, except it's do-or-die. You either win or 
you go home. I'm not ready to go home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his career, he has recorded more than 1,300 tackles, 12  
forced fumbles, 24 interceptions and 89 passes defensed. And he has 
issued countless warnings to opposing receivers and running backs: 
Pain zone ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he has been selected to his eighth Pro Bowl and his  
third as a starter, Atwater has given increasing thought to his 
future and might opt to retire, producing a leadership void in the 
Broncos' defense similar to the effect of Elway's expected 
retirement on the offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to end sometime, but whether or not it's this year,  
I haven't decided,'' Atwater said. ``It would take away from my 
preparation to think about it right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his healthier moments, the Broncos' hit man doesn't believe  
he is ready to leave the game. This could be his last season with 
the Broncos, however. Or it might be his last season as a full-time 
starter, because young safeties Eric Brown and George Coghill 
already have seen increased playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything's possible,'' he said. ``I hope it's not my last year  
with the Broncos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A first-round draft choice, Atwater was selected to the Pro Bowl  
his second season, beginning a string of seven straight Pro Bowl 
appearances that set a franchise record. 
</P>
<P>
	Dubbed the ``smiling assassin'' by former assistant coach  
Charlie Waters because of his sunny off-field disposition and his 
bone-jarring tackling, Atwater established his reputation in his 
second season. That's when he stopped Kansas City's mammoth running 
back, Christian Okoye, with a thunderous collision in a memorable 
Monday night game. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's 234-pound Jamal Anderson represents a similar  
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that he's so big and he has really good feet for a  
guy that big allows him to break a lot of tackles and make you 
miss,'' Atwater said. ``There's really no way you can prepare for 
him. Come Sunday, we're going to have to go after him like a pack 
of wolves.''

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com Losses Quadruple </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A surge in Internet holiday shopping helped  
online retail giant Amazon.com Inc. triple its fourth-quarter 
revenues even as its losses quadrupled. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Seattle-based company managed to beat analysts'  
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com said Tuesday that it lost $46.43 million, or 30 cents  
a share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of 
$10.81 million, or 8 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. 
The results include a charge of $24.2 million for costs associated 
with recent acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were $252.89 million, up from $66.04 million a year ago.  
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the charges, Amazon.com lost $22.18 million, or 14  
cents a share, in the fourth quarter. Analysts surveyed by First 
Call had expected its operating losses to be 18 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1995, Amazon.com has yet to make a profit as it  
spends freely to advertise its site and expand its offerings. It 
added music, videos and a small selection of electronics and toys 
to its site last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its continued losses, it is a favorite stock on Wall  
Street, with investors bidding up Amazon.com shares in recent 
months on expectations that it will be a big winner as more people 
shop on the Internet in the coming years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amazon.com is spending a lot of money on sales and marketing,  
but that is money well spent,'' said Jae Kim, an analyst at Paul 
Kagan &AMP; Associates in Carmel, Calif. ``It is the cost of doing 
business on the Web and without it, you can't really do business 
successfully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The number of customer accounts at Amazon.com's World Wide Web  
site increased by more than 1.7 million during the fourth quarter 
to nearly 6.2 million. That compares with 1.5 million customer 
accounts at the end of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	During the holiday weeks between Nov. 17 and Dec. 31, Amazon.com  
shipped more than 7.5 million items, more than the companyv shipped 
during the entirety of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	About 25 percent of its sales in the fourth quarter came from  
its music, video and international markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of music, which it began to sell in June, were $33.1  
million, more than double the $14.4 million that was sold in the 
third quarter. The company didn't provide sales figures for its 
video division, which began on Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com's British and German operations nearly quadrupled  
over the third quarter, making them the No. 1 online booksellers in 
their countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com also said that it would expand its distribution  
system to better handle orders. During the holidays, Amazon.com 
could not fulfill all of its processing in a timely manner and some 
customers received gifts after Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com previously announced that it was leasing a new  
distribution center in Nevada that would speed up its shipping 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	For 1998, Amazon.com lost $124.55 million, or 84 cents a share,  
compared with a loss of $31.02 million, or 24 cents a share, in 
1997. Sales totaled $609.99 million, up from $147.79 million last 
year.

<HEADLINE>  Pope Arrives in St. Louis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Pope John Paul II arrived in St. Louis today  
for his fifth visit to the U.S. mainland and immediately compared 
America's old battles over racism and slavery to new ones over 
abortion and euthanasia. ``America faces a similar time of trial,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Recalling the U.S. Supreme Court's 1857 Dred Scott decision,  
which reduced slaves to property, the pope said there is today ``a 
culture that seeks to declare entire groups of human beings ... 
considered `unuseful' to be outside the boundaries of legal 
protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the airport ceremony -- the start of a 30-hour stay in St.  
Louis, following his triumphant five-day trip to Mexico -- he also 
called upon Americans to ``open wide your hearts'' to less 
fortunate people. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope was greeted by President Clinton. ``For 20 years you  
have lifted our spirits and touched our hearts,'' Clinton said. 
``For 20 years you have challenged of us to think of life not in 
terms of what we acquire for ourselves but in terms of what we give 
of ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president quoted a Polish phrase that means, ``May you live  
a hundred years and more.'' And he added: ``May you continue 
working and teaching and lighting the way. ... Welcome to the 
United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then the pope and the president met privately in a hangar, while  
Hillary Rodham Clinton greeted cardinals assembled for the pope's 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope has criticized U.S. policy on the death penalty,  
abortion and economic sanctions against Cuba and Iraq, and on 
Monday the Vatican condemned an American missile attack on Iraq. In 
a statement, spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said the bombing 
``confirms once again'' the pope's view that military measures 
``don't resolve problems in themselves, rather they aggravate 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The differences shouldn't dampen the pope's welcome for the  
visit. As many as 600,000 people were expected to turn out; more 
than 530,000 Catholics live in the St. Louis area. 
</P>
<P>
	When the papal plane landed at Lambert Airport, young people  
waiting at the Kiel Center to join the pope in a youth rally this 
evening reacted with a rousing cheer. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally is a fitting event because the pope is counting on  
young Catholics to battle what he calls a ``culture of death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, he is scheduled to celebrate Mass before 104,000  
people at the Trans World Dome. He also is to take part in an 
evening service at the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis before 
departing Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	His departure from Mexico City was an emotional one.  
</P>
<P>
	Spectators at the airport burst into tears, waving white and  
yellow handkerchiefs and chanting: ``Let him stay!'' 
Schoolchildren, religious officials and members of the crowd rushed 
onto the red carpet to kneel before the pope and kiss his hand as 
he made his way toward the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands of people lined the pope's route from the  
Vatican's nunciate, or embassy, to the airport, waving pennants 
emblazoned with the pope's portrait and the word ``adios.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``God bless you Mexico, for the loyalty and love your sons give  
to the church,'' the pope declared at a departure ceremony attended 
by President Ernesto Zedillo. 
</P>
<P>
	The pontiff also received a rousing farewell Monday evening  
inside the giant Azteca Stadium, where he decried drug trafficking, 
corruption and other evils of modern society. There, the frail, 
78-year-old pope rose from his chair and held up his arms to the 
crowd of 110,000 that chanted ``John Paul II, the world loves 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maria Teresa Pulido, 28, went to the Azteca Stadium celebration  
but said it wasn't enough. She returned with her 6-year-old son 
Rafael to the street at 2 a.m. to wait along John Paul's route. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to see him one more time. It's the last chance that  
I'll have,'' she said. ``He tells you with a strong conviction what 
you have to do for your children to prepare them for the new 
millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The visit to St. Louis is the pontiff's second leg of a mission  
to give new direction to his flock on the eve of the third 
millennium and to strengthen ties between Roman Catholics in North 
and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	In the course of his five days in Mexico, John Paul outlined  
church strategy throughout the Americas for the start of the new 
millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed a declaration containing that strategy. It also  
condemned the evils of exploitative capitalism, abortion, 
euthanasia and capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged Catholics to more vigorously defend their faith against  
Protestant sects that have made inroads in Latin America, and he 
stressed the need to preach to both rich and poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the strategy involves bringing civic leaders back into  
contact with the church.

for his fifth visit to the U.S. mainland and immediately compared 
America's old battles over racism and slavery to new ones over 
abortion and euthanasia. ``America faces a similar time of trial,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Recalling the U.S. Supreme Court's 1857 Dred Scott decision,  
which reduced slaves to property, the pope said there is today ``a 
culture that seeks to declare entire groups of human beings ... 
considered `unuseful' to be outside the boundaries of legal 
protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the airport ceremony -- the start of a 30-hour stay in St.  
Louis, following his triumphant five-day trip to Mexico -- he also 
called upon Americans to ``open wide your hearts'' to less 
fortunate people. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope was greeted by President Clinton. ``For 20 years you  
have lifted our spirits and touched our hearts,'' Clinton said. 
``For 20 years you have challenged of us to think of life not in 
terms of what we acquire for ourselves but in terms of what we give 
of ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president quoted a Polish phrase that means, ``May you live  
a hundred years and more.'' And he added: ``May you continue 
working and teaching and lighting the way. ... Welcome to the 
United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then the pope and the president met privately in a hangar, while  
Hillary Rodham Clinton greeted cardinals assembled for the pope's 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope has criticized U.S. policy on the death penalty,  
abortion and economic sanctions against Cuba and Iraq, and on 
Monday the Vatican condemned an American missile attack on Iraq. In 
a statement, spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said the bombing 
``confirms once again'' the pope's view that military measures 
``don't resolve problems in themselves, rather they aggravate 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The differences shouldn't dampen the pope's welcome for the  
visit. As many as 600,000 people were expected to turn out; more 
than 530,000 Catholics live in the St. Louis area. 
</P>
<P>
	When the papal plane landed at Lambert Airport, young people  
waiting at the Kiel Center to join the pope in a youth rally this 
evening reacted with a rousing cheer. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally is a fitting event because the pope is counting on  
young Catholics to battle what he calls a ``culture of death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, he is scheduled to celebrate Mass before 104,000  
people at the Trans World Dome. He also is to take part in an 
evening service at the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis before 
departing Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	His departure from Mexico City was an emotional one.  
</P>
<P>
	Spectators at the airport burst into tears, waving white and  
yellow handkerchiefs and chanting: ``Let him stay!'' 
Schoolchildren, religious officials and members of the crowd rushed 
onto the red carpet to kneel before the pope and kiss his hand as 
he made his way toward the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands of people lined the pope's route from the  
Vatican's nunciate, or embassy, to the airport, waving pennants 
emblazoned with the pope's portrait and the word ``adios.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``God bless you Mexico, for the loyalty and love your sons give  
to the church,'' the pope declared at a departure ceremony attended 
by President Ernesto Zedillo. 
</P>
<P>
	The pontiff also received a rousing farewell Monday evening  
inside the giant Azteca Stadium, where he decried drug trafficking, 
corruption and other evils of modern society. There, the frail, 
78-year-old pope rose from his chair and held up his arms to the 
crowd of 110,000 that chanted ``John Paul II, the world loves 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maria Teresa Pulido, 28, went to the Azteca Stadium celebration  
but said it wasn't enough. She returned with her 6-year-old son 
Rafael to the street at 2 a.m. to wait along John Paul's route. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to see him one more time. It's the last chance that  
I'll have,'' she said. ``He tells you with a strong conviction what 
you have to do for your children to prepare them for the new 
millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The visit to St. Louis is the pontiff's second leg of a mission  
to give new direction to his flock on the eve of the third 
millennium and to strengthen ties between Roman Catholics in North 
and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	In the course of his five days in Mexico, John Paul outlined  
church strategy throughout the Americas for the start of the new 
millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed a declaration containing that strategy. It also  
condemned the evils of exploitative capitalism, abortion, 
euthanasia and capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged Catholics to more vigorously defend their faith against  
Protestant sects that have made inroads in Latin America, and he 
stressed the need to preach to both rich and poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the strategy involves bringing civic leaders back into  
contact with the church.

<HEADLINE> Elway Hasn't Thrived in Super Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Befitting his credentials as a future Hall of  
Famer, John Elway's name is scattered prominently throughout the 
NFL record book. Why, then, can't he summon a great Super Bowl 
performance? 
</P>
<P>
	It's not from lack of trying. In fact, it may be from trying too  
hard. 
</P>
<P>
	In his four previous Super Bowl appearances for the Denver  
Broncos, Elway, the master of electrifying late-game comebacks and 
daring escapes from the pocket, has been merely pedestrian. 
</P>
<P>
	His passer rating in those four Super Bowls combined is a  
dreadful 49.9, which compares unfavorably with his 93.0 rating this 
season. He hasn't finished a season with a rating below the mid-80s 
since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	At 49.9, his numbers are more akin to struggling San Diego  
rookie Ryan Leaf than to Joe Montana, who has the NFL's top career 
passer rating in his four Super Bowls (127.8). Jim Plunkett is 
second (122.8 in two games), and Terry Bradshaw is third (112.8 in 
four games). 
</P>
<P>
	Elway is 18th.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've wanted to put up big numbers in every football game I've  
ever played,'' Elway said Tuesday. ``I can't try any harder than 
I've always tried. I'm going to play this one as hard as I've 
played the other 230-some games that I've ever played. Hopefully, 
it works out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It worked out the last time, although not in the way Elway might  
have envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
	While Elway fashioned another ordinary Super Bowl effort --  
completing 12 of 22 passes for 123 yards with no touchdowns and an 
interception for a 51.9 rating -- his Broncos beat Green Bay 31-24, 
thanks to MVP Terrell Davis' 157 yards and three scores. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he still yearned to be a Super Bowl MVP, Elway said,  
``You bet. I want to do the best I can, but the bottom line is I 
want to win. Would winning the MVP be a thrill? Sure. It would be 
great -- if it came along with a win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak, who served as Elway's  
backup for nine seasons before taking on the coordinator job in 
1995, said he will remember Elway as ``the greatest competitor I've 
ever been around,'' not for his lackluster Super Bowl performances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't think he's played poorly,'' Kubiak said. ``As  
we found out last year, teams win this game, not one player. Maybe 
too much is made out of one position. We had to run the ball to win 
that game last year, so John's statistics weren't going to be 
tremendous, but he did what he had to do for us to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Elway admits that in the Broncos' three previous Super Bowl  
appearances -- after the 1986, 1987 and 1989 seasons -- he was 
considered a one-man show on offense, which required him to try to 
do too much in the title game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Back then, I always thought that for us to win, I had to play  
real well,'' Elway said. ``That's not to take away from the guys we 
had. But after that first Super Bowl, I think I put more and more 
pressure on myself with each one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway turned in a decent effort in his first Super Bowl,  
completing 22 of 37 passes for 304 yards with one touchdown and one 
interception for an 83.6 rating in Denver's 39-20 loss to the New 
York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	It never got better than that.  
</P>
<P>
	In a loss to Washington the following year, he threw three  
interceptions and got a 36.8 rating. Then, against San Francisco, 
his statistics were positively Leafian -- 10 for 26, 108 yards, no 
touchdowns, two interceptions for a 19.4 rating. 
</P>
<P>
	The pressure was off last season, however, because of Davis, who  
ran for 1,750 yards and followed it up with 2,008 this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, we had such a great running game, it really took  
the pressure off of me,'' he said. ``I just had to hand off to 
Terrell last year. It's nice to be in that situation where you have 
a real good football team around you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's surrounded by another real good one this year.

<HEADLINE>  Hit-Man Atwater Comes Up Big </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	big games  
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Haunted by the awful memory of the worst blowout  
loss in Super Bowl history, Steve Atwater had to wait eight long 
years to eradicate it. 
</P>
<P>
	A Denver Broncos rookie in 1989, Atwater endured a 55-10 defeat  
to the San Francisco 49ers in the Super Bowl and didn't get a shot 
at redemption until last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwater began to doubt that chance would ever come, as did  
teammate John Elway, who at least had the experience of previous, 
less lopsided Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	When the chance came, and the Broncos responded with a 31-24  
victory over the Green Bay Packers last January, it represented 
tremendous elation -- but mostly relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was huge,'' Atwater said Monday night. ``When you play in a  
game like that and you don't have success, it's one of those 
memories you want to get out of your mind. When you win, it's 
something you take with you for the rest of your life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, in their return trip to the Super Bowl, the Broncos have  
different concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more difficult to come in here as the defending  
champions,'' Atwater said. ``You're a little complacent and relaxed 
because you've been here before. It's something we have to guard 
against.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atwater, 32 and in his 10th season, knows he is a step slower  
and doesn't always hit with the ferocity he once did because of 
chronically sore shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season and again this season, he failed to post 100 tackles  
for the only times in his career, a sure sign that his body finally 
is beginning to wear down. 
</P>
<P>
	But he remains a force, especially in big games.  
</P>
<P>
	To many NFL observers, Atwater's play in last January's Super  
Bowl set a standard for free safeties. 
</P>
<P>
	He had six tackles, a sack, a forced fumble and two passes  
defensed. 
</P>
<P>
	His sack of Brett Favre caused a fumble that was recovered by  
Neil Smith, setting up a field goal for a 17-7 lead in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, he had one of the game's biggest pass breakups on a  
third-and-8 from the Broncos 39 early in the fourth quarter, 
knocking away a pass intended for Robert Brooks that would have 
given Green Bay a first down inside the 25 with the score tied 
24-24. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was able to get around the ball and make some plays,'' he  
said. ``That's all any player wants, an opportunity to make some 
plays. I'm hoping I can get the opportunity to get around the ball 
again this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not much difference in preparing for regular season  
games and playoff games, except it's do-or-die. You either win or 
you go home. I'm not ready to go home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his career, he has recorded more than 1,300 tackles, 12  
forced fumbles, 24 interceptions and 89 passes defensed. And he has 
issued countless warnings to opposing receivers and running backs: 
Pain zone ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he has been selected to his eighth Pro Bowl and his  
third as a starter, Atwater has given increasing thought to his 
future and might opt to retire, producing a leadership void in the 
Broncos' defense similar to the effect of Elway's expected 
retirement on the offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to end sometime, but whether or not it's this year,  
I haven't decided,'' Atwater said. ``It would take away from my 
preparation to think about it right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his healthier moments, the Broncos' hit man doesn't believe  
he is ready to leave the game. This could be his last season with 
the Broncos, however. Or it might be his last season as a full-time 
starter, because young safeties Eric Brown and George Coghill 
already have seen increased playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything's possible,'' he said. ``I hope it's not my last year  
with the Broncos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A first-round draft choice, Atwater was selected to the Pro Bowl  
his second season, beginning a string of seven straight Pro Bowl 
appearances that set a franchise record. 
</P>
<P>
	Dubbed the ``smiling assassin'' by former assistant coach  
Charlie Waters because of his sunny off-field disposition and his 
bone-jarring tackling, Atwater established his reputation in his 
second season. That's when he stopped Kansas City's mammoth running 
back, Christian Okoye, with a thunderous collision in a memorable 
Monday night game. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's 234-pound Jamal Anderson represents a similar  
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that he's so big and he has really good feet for a  
guy that big allows him to break a lot of tackles and make you 
miss,'' Atwater said. ``There's really no way you can prepare for 
him. Come Sunday, we're going to have to go after him like a pack 
of wolves.''

<HEADLINE> Boeing Weathers Profit Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing Co. weathered a tough year of aircraft  
production delays, lost business and lawsuits, but finished 1998 
with a profit that was better than Wall Street expected and signs 
that its factories are returning to health. 
</P>
<P>
	The worst seems to be over for the world's biggest aerospace  
company, Philip M. Condit, chairman and chief executive officer, 
said Tuesday in releasing financial results for the fourth quarter 
and all of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made progress and the current plans reflect that  
progress, but we still have a ways to go,'' Condit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing earned $465 million, or 48 cents a share, for the final  
three months of 1998 compared with a loss of $498 million, or 51 
cents a share, a year earlier. The 1997 loss reflected a special 
charge of $876 million for commercial aircraft product lines of the 
former McDonnell Douglas Corp., which Boeing acquired that year. 
</P>
<P>
	The results bettered the average 42 cents a share estimated by  
analysts surveyed by First Call. But with problems remaining on the 
horizon, Boeing's stock fell 2.8 percent Tuesday, dropping $1 to 
close at $35 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the quarter rose to $17.1 billion, up 46 percent  
from $11.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The next few years won't be easy for Boeing, with depressed  
economies in Asia, lingering production difficulties and declining 
aircraft orders, Condit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief among Boeing's goals, he said, is to increase operating  
profit margins on its commercial jetliners, which were zero last 
year, to 3 percent or better in 1999 and 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	There is little Boeing can do to increase revenues since planes  
are ordered years in advance, company President Harry Stonecipher 
said, but he hopes to significantly cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The company forecasts total revenue of $58 billion in 1999,  
dropping to about $49 billion in 2000 when it expects to deliver 
about 480 commercial jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing already has announced plans to reduce its worldwide  
employment from a high of 238,000 this year to between 185,000 and 
195,000 by the end of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Boeing earned $1.1 billion, or $1.15 a share, on  
revenue of $56.2 billion, compared with a loss of $178 million, or 
18 cents a share, on revenue of $45.8 billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Problems with parts shortages, snarled assembly lines, delays in  
the bringing out the new-generation 737 and other production woes 
cost the company billions of dollars in 1997 and continued through 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing Commercial Airplane Group has reduced parts shortages and  
assembly line snags, and is close to delivering all aircraft on 
schedule, though overtime remains high, said division president 
Alan Mulally. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Boeing agreed to pay $15 million to settle two  
class-action discrimination lawsuits filed last year by past and 
present black employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The company delivered 559 commercial jetliners in 1998, up from  
374 a year earlier, but the company was still feeling effects of 
the Asian financial crisis, which caused airlines to postpone 
aircraft purchases. Archrival Airbus Industrie also captured a 
number of key orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing helped some airlines take delivery of new jets in late  
1998 by offering short-term operating leases, and the company is 
carrying $1.2 billion more in customer financing than at the end of 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said commercial aircraft revenue for the year was  
$35.5 billion, up $8.6 billion from 1997. Because of pricing 
pressures and the mix of aircraft delivered, earnings for that 
segment were just $63 million for the year, though far better than 
commercial aircraft's loss of $1.8 billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly it is a dramatic move to the better, but it is just  
one small step,'' said Deborah Hopkins, Boeing's newly named chief 
financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing is delivering more 777 and new-generation 737 models,  
planes that have higher production costs than rolling out more 
versions of older models. The new 737 models have yet to turn a 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
	The same pressures will continue in 1999, when the company  
expects to deliver 620 aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Jetliner orders have slowed dramatically over the past year, due  
in great part to the financial uncertainty in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are very clearly signs that at least in areas of Asia  
there has been measurable stabilization,'' Condit said. ``We're 
seeing airline traffic up on a year-over-year basis. But there's a 
very big asterisk -- it's up over very depressed levels of a year 
ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he expects orders to remain ``significantly down''  
because of the continuing economic situation, but that Boeing has 
``a big, strong backlog'' of 1,786 jets on order. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing took orders for 656 airliners worth $42 billion in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Capers Comes Aboard With Jaguars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Tom Coughlin let go of the past and  
offered Dom Capers a job. Capers set aside his ego and accepted it. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the strangest turns on this year's coaching carousel,  
Capers will go to work for the coach who was considered among his 
biggest rivals when the expansion battle between the Jacksonville 
Jaguars and Carolina Panthers began in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Fired last month as coach of the Panthers, Capers was named  
Tuesday to serve as Coughlin's defensive coordinator with the 
Jaguars. He replaces Dick Jauron, who left after four seasons to 
coach the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm thrilled to join Tom's staff and to have the opportunity  
to help upgrade the Jaguars' defense,'' Capers said. ``The Jaguars 
have shown constant improvement each season, and I look forward to 
this new challenge with great anticipation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a move brimming with irony, one nobody would have imagined  
when the Panthers and Jaguars came into the league four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Both coaches had reputations as tough disciplinarians with great  
football minds, but their teams approached expansion in vastly 
different ways -- Carolina going for free-agent pickups engineered 
by then-general manager Bill Polian and Jacksonville opting to 
build through the draft, with Coughlin making all the decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Success came quickly to both. Capers' Panthers won the NFC West  
title on its way to the conference title game in 1996, while 
Coughlin's Jaguars made it to the AFC Championship game as a 
wild-card team. 
</P>
<P>
	The roads diverged from there, with Jacksonville making two more  
playoff appearances and Capers losing his job after going 7-9 and 
4-12 and losing control of his locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin put history behind him and thought of only one thing --  
hiring the best coach available. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dom Capers is an excellent football coach,'' Coughlin said.  
``He has ascended through the coaching ranks, proving his quality 
at each level. He's a great fit for the Jaguars' organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Capers, Coughlin gets the coordinator who led the Pittsburgh  
Steelers' defense back to prominence from 1992-94, and one of the 
first big proponents of the zone-blitz schemes that have been in 
vogue the last few years. Before that, Capers spent six years as a 
defensive backs coach with New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	His task will be to revamp a defense that has finished 25th and  
23rd in yardage allowed the last two seasons. The Jaguars are 
expected to turn over no fewer than four members of the defense 
through free agency and the draft. A shift to the 3-4 alignment 
that Capers has always preferred is not out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Coughlin still must hire an offensive coordinator to  
replace Chris Palmer, who left for the newest expansion team, the 
Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Bears coordinator Matt Cavanaugh was in town Monday for  
interviews, but left to talk with the Baltimore Ravens.

	Heavy, wet snow was falling in California and the northern  
Plains today while the Northeast, Great Lakes and Southeast basked 
beneath sunny skies. 
</P>
<P>
	A very quiet weather pattern was expected to continue over the  
eastern United States thanks to a large area of high pressure that 
was forecast to slowly make its way off the North Carolina coast. 
</P>
<P>
	This high was forecast to brighten areas of the East with calm,  
mostly sunny skies and dry weather from the eastern Great Lakes 
through the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	Mostly sunny skies and dry weather also were expected from the  
mid-Atlantic states and Ohio Valley, south to the Gulf Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	A storm system collecting over the Rockies was forecast to move  
out into the Plains states, bringing a mixture of rain and sleet to 
the northern and central Plains, as well as the western Great 
Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow was expected to fall across the Dakotas, and freezing rain  
and sleet were likely over sections of Nebraska and northern Iowa. 
Rain was forecast over Iowa and northern Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	Chilly rain also was expected to hit Wisconsin and Minnesota by  
evening while the southern Plains could escape with cloudy skies 
and dry weather. The Plains, however, should be howling with gusty

<HEADLINE>  Mark McGwire Honored in St. Louis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- This year's St. Louis Baseball Man of the year  
was a no-brainer: Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	The home run king, wrapping up his first visit to town since  
hitting No. 70 on Sept. 27, was honored Monday night by the St. 
Louis chapter of the Baseball Writers Association of America. 
Cardinals teammates still are shaking their heads at his 
accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the most fun year I've ever had, just being a part of  
that,'' pitcher Kent Mercker said. ``It was a blast, and I hope it 
happens again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire came to town three days before the pope's arrival and  
seemingly created the same sort of stir. During his two-hour 
autograph session Sunday at the team's annual winter charity event, 
fans who weren't lucky enough to have won in a raffle for his 
signature crowded around him just for a glimpse. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals Hall of Famer Bob Gibson, among the honorees at the  
sold-out dinner, said McGwire's feat wasn't the biggest surprise to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``What surprised me is the pitchers kept throwing to him,'' said  
Gibson, now a special assistant to American League president Gene 
Budig. ``I would have challenged him. Maybe I had better control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A highlight of the dinner was an auction for a signed drawing  
depicting McGwire atop a horse. Among the bidders were wives of the 
Cardinals' owners and Cheryl Smith, wife of Missouri football coach 
Larry Smith, who bowed out at $7,500. 
</P>
<P>
	The drawing ended up fetching $11,000 from a mystery bidder at  
the back of the room who turned out to be Phil Ozersky, the man who 
caught McGwire's 70th home run ball and turned it into a $2.7 
million profit. 
</P>
<P>
	During a lull in the auction, McGwire stepped in for master of  
ceremonies Bob Costas and got the bidding rolling. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is worth more than the ball,'' McGwire said. ``I touched  
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire signed the picture: ``To Phil, nice catch!''  
</P>
<P>
	The only thing missing from McGwire's visit was a summit meeting  
with Pope John Paul II, who's in town Tuesday and Wednesday. 
McGwire was raised Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, it's not going to be able to work out,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other headliners at the sold-out dinner, which attracted 2,000  
fans, were New York Yankees manager Joe Torre and baseball 
commissioner Bud Selig. Torre was fired by the Cardinals in 1995 
after five years as manager, but his Yankees set a major-league 
record last year with 114 victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig was being honored for meritorious service to baseball.  
</P>
<P>
	Three Cardinals players were on the list of award-winners;  
outfielder Ray Lankford for outstanding achievement, catcher Eli 
Marrero as the team's rookie of the year, and new outfielder Eric 
Davis for his comeback from colon cancer. Former Cardinals 
outfielder Brian Jordan, who signed a free-agent deal with Atlanta, 
also was honored for outstanding achievements in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Other honorees included Cardinals Hall of Famer Lou Brock,  
Indians first baseman Jim Thome, Smith and Missouri players Corby 
Jones and Devin West, bowler Pete Weber, umpire Rich Rieker and 
golfer Bob Goalby. Rieker, who is from St. Louis, was working when 
McGwire hit his first and 70th home runs last season, as well as 
his 400th career homer. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who threw a touchdown pass at the Senior Bowl on Sunday,  
felt a little out of place given the baseball theme. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel I shouldn't be here,'' Jones said. ``But hey, I'll take  
it.''

<HEADLINE> Tenneco To Sell Containerboard Biz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- Tenneco, maker of Hefty and Baggies  
brand plastic bags, has reached an agreement to sell its 
containerboard business to buyout firm Madison Dearborn Partners 
for $2.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale, announced today, is part of a strategic restructuring  
of Tenneco's packaging and automotive businesses. The company had 
announced last summer it was considering splitting the businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``This sale is an excellent value for our shareholders. It  
enables a number of financially attractive strategic alternatives 
for the automotive and specialty packaging businesses,'' said 
Tenneco Chairman Dana G. Mead. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison Dearborn Partners Inc., based in Chicago, manages about  
$4 billion of assets. It focuses on investments in specific 
industries including natural resources, communications, consumer, 
health care, and financial services. 
</P>
<P>
	Tenneco said it will receive $2 billion in cash and retain a 45  
percent equity ownership in the business, valued at $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In reporting its fourth-quarter 1998 and full-year earnings  
today, Tenneco said income in the paperboard packaging segment 
improved over the full year. But fourth-quarter earnings were down 
slightly from the same quarter in 1997, due largely to lower 
prices, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tenneco also makes Monroe shock absorbers, Walker exhaust  
systems and E-Z Foil single-use aluminum cookware, among other 
products.

<HEADLINE> Astros Sign Xavier Hernandez </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Reliever Xavier Hernandez, whose contract with  
Baltimore was voided after he failed a physical, agreed to a 
$250,000, one-year deal with the Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez will begin his third stint with the Astros, for whom  
he last pitched in 1996. The 33-year-old right-hander spent last 
season with the Texas Rangers, going 6-6 with one save and a 3.57 
ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez agreed earlier to a $2.7 million, two-year deal with  
the Orioles, but that was wiped out when he did not pass a physical 
conducted by Baltimore's medical staff. The Orioles were concerned 
about Hernandez's right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've evaluated the situation, and we feel comfortable moving  
forward,'' Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel like `X' will be a great addition, and his experience  
and the success he's enjoyed will be welcomed in a somewhat 
inexperienced bullpen. He always takes the ball and gives you 
everything he's got. He's definitely going to add something to our 
chemistry,'' Hunsicker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez, who can earn an additional $250,000 in roster  
bonuses, joins a bullpen that is expected to consist also of closer 
Billy Wagner, setup men Jay Powell and Doug Henry and left-hander 
Trever Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	That means at least one spot will be up for grabs when the NL  
Central champions report to spring training Feb. 17 in Kissimmee, 
Fla.

<HEADLINE> Students Said To Rob Out of Need </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CRUZ, Calif. (AP) -- Two college students allegedly robbed  
two local businesses at gunpoint in hopes of stealing enough so 
they wouldn't have to work while attending school. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Louis Cristofani, a senior philosophy major, and  
freshman Emma Rose Freeman, a promising writer, were arrested 
Friday and could be expelled from the University of California, 
Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
	They are charged with robbing a hair salon Jan. 16 and a Costco  
warehouse store in Santa Cruz five days later. An elementary school 
teaching aide, Craig Dickson, allegedly drove the getaway car. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm devastated,'' Linda Freeman, the young woman's mother,  
told the Santa Cruz Sentinel from her Southern California home. 
``This is a girl who was a national merit scholar. Her only offense 
was to brake for a squirrel. Then there was a total change after 
she went to college.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives suspected from the start the robbers might have been  
from UC Santa Cruz because they were well groomed and nicely 
dressed. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first heist, a man walked into a hair salon, whistling,  
followed by a young woman who pointed a gun at a stylist. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tell her what you want, honey,'' the male suspect reportedly  
said to his female companion. 
</P>
<P>
	They fled with less than $100.  
</P>
<P>
	In the second robbery, the pair were seen leaving Costco with  
several electronic items. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickson, 23, and Cristofani, 23, posted bail. Freeman, 18, was  
scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday. Her bail was set at $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said she wanted to concentrate on her art and she didn't  
have time to work,'' police Sgt. Steve Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
	UC Santa Cruz spokesman Jim Burns said administrators are  
reviewing the case to determine what disciplinary action to take. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickson and Cristofani have unlisted phone numbers and could not  
be reached for comment. Freeman's attorney said he was only 
handling her bail hearing and could not comment on her guilt or 
innocence.

<HEADLINE> 4Q Earnings Increase for Whirlpool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENTON HARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- Home-appliance maker Whirlpool  
Corp.'s fourth-quarter earnings jumped 30 percent to $83 million, 
edging Wall Street estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	But the company warned that the Brazilian currency devaluation  
could harm first-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	In the three months ended Dec. 31, Whirlpool earned $1.09 per  
share -- a penny more than what analysts surveyed by First Call 
Corp. had projected. In the year-ago period, Whirlpool earned $64 
million, or 85 cents per diluted share. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-quarter sales totaled $1.7 billion, up 9 percent from the  
same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, Whirlpool earned $310 million, or $4.06 per  
diluted share, on revenue of $10.3 billion. That was up 37 percent 
from 1997 earnings of $226 million, or $2.99 a share, on revenue of 
$8.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Whirlpool also warned that every 1 percent devaluation in the  
Brazilian currency could drop its net earnings this quarter by 1.5 
cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	New product introductions, ``consumer-focused service  
offerings'' and additional cost costs could mitigate the Brazilian 
effect, Whirlpool said. 
</P>
<P>
	``While some of our major appliance markets will continue to be  
challenged by economic conditions, we believe the strength of our 
combined global businesses will allow us to deliver solid 
performance improvements,'' said David Whitwam, Whirlpool's 
chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Whirlpool, based in Benton Harbor, is a leading maker of major  
appliances, marketing 11 major brand names in 170 countries.

<HEADLINE> Rome Mayor Demands New Olympic Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- The mayor demands a recount.  
</P>
<P>
	A new vote to assign the 2004 Summer Games is needed, Rome Mayor  
Francesco Rutelli said Tuesday, contending the choice of Athens, 
Greece, is now tainted by the Olympic bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very angry,'' Rutelli said. ``A panel of IOC experts and  
athletes gave Rome the No. 1 spot on the list of candidates. Until 
24 hours before the vote we were in the lead. And then -- who knows 
what happened?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after the International Olympic Committee ousted six  
members following revelations of corruption in the bidding process, 
Rutelli called for a committee of experts to carry out a new poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Athens beat Rome 66-41 in September 1997 in the final round of  
voting for the 2004 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing is to remove every shadow of doubt  
about the decision,'' he said. ``That would be a move to make clear 
what now is not clear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said Salt Lake City's 2002 bid committee spent $800,000  
on 14 IOC members, including travel expenses, scholarships for 
their children and cash payments. In addition to the expulsions, 
three IOC members quit. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC officials have said Salt Lake City will not be stripped of  
the 2002 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Athens has not been specifically targeted by the  
corruption inquiries, the IOC has said it will examine the 
selection process for the games from 1996 to 2006. 
</P>
<P>
	``Athens won, and I hope Athens won by fair play, but ... if  
there is an independent committee, perhaps the decision could be 
changed and shifted to another city,'' Rutelli said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that Italian members of the IOC told him at the time of  
the 1997 vote that ``many African and Latin American delegates 
changed their votes in the very last hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The head of Rome's failed bid, Raffaele Ranucci, told the ANSA  
news agency he didn't think the 2004 decision was affected by what 
he called ``those little games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always figured that the Greek capital was being paid  
back for not getting the 1996 Olympics,'' Ranucci said. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy is now trying to land the 2006 Winter Games, with Turin  
considered a notch behind Swiss front-runner Sion. 
</P>
<P>
	In Greece, the president of Hellenic Olympic Committee, Lambis  
Nikolaou, defended his city's 2004 triumph. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vote is closed,'' Nikolaou said. ``The games were given  
cleanly. The doors are open, the dogs are tied up and they can come 
and examine whatever they want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Athens Mayor Dimitris Avramopoulos: ``Nothing can reverse  
the vote taken by the International Olympic Committee. The things 
said by the otherwise thoroughly likable mayor of Rome, I must say, 
are groundless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--The opposition faction in Berlin's Senate sent the IOC files  
from the city's 1993 bid for the 2000 Games. Greens leader Judith 
Demba, who called the IOC a ``club of corrupt old men,'' said 
Berlin bidders spent $1.53 million on travel, lodging, car rental, 
gifts and other expenses for 56 IOC members who visited the city. 
</P>
<P>
	She claimed scores of presents exceeded the IOC limit of $150.  
Demba also said IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch charged the 
bid committee $3,724 for a domestic air ticket between Stuttgart 
and Berlin that normally would cost one-tenth the sum. 
</P>
<P>
	Walther Troeger, an IOC member and president of the German  
National Olympic Committee, said he did not expect the IOC to find 
proof of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	--In England, the head of Manchester's failed campaign for the  
2000 Games, said IOC members were taken to Wimbledon and Football 
Association Cup soccer games as part of a $9 million campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were in the business of showing people round,'' Bob Scott  
said. ``We were in the business of entertaining. We were in the 
business of, you know, sort of `gross hospitality' is the phrase 
that I think we can be accused of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Canadian swimmer Mark Tewksbury left his Olympic gold medal on  
a table at a news conference, saying it had lost its meaning 
because of the bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an Olympic gold medal, if anyone wants it,'' said  
Tewksbury, who won the 100-meter backstroke at the 1992 Barcelona 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Juan Antonio Samaranch should resign ... the entire IOC needs  
to be restructured. I'm here to defend Olympism, to defend the 
movement, not to defend the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Nagano police said IOC visitors received free rides on police  
helicopters during the city's successful bid for the 1998 Games. 
Nagano officials already have said IOC voters were given free trips 
to Kyoto, some IOC officials were entertained by geisha and 
Samaranch received an expensive painting and Japanese sword. 
</P>
<P>
	``What was offered was definitely not excessive -- it was  
normal,'' said Japanese Olympic Committee executive board member 
Chiharu Igaya, also an IOC executive board member. ``In business, 
entertainment is far more extravagant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--African sports authorities complain their IOC members were  
unfairly made the focus of the bribery scandal. Six Africans are 
among the nine members expelled or forced to resign and a seventh 
delegate is under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lavish gifts were presented at midnight, instead of being  
rolled on a trolley through a hotel lobby at noon,'' said Robert 
Magagula, vice president of Swaziland's Olympic committee. ``That 
happened to all IOC members, not just African members.''

<HEADLINE> Hand Transplant Man Moves Finger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- The man who received the first hand  
transplant in the United States moved a finger on Tuesday, and 
doctors said there are no signs of rejection or infection. 
</P>
<P>
	``His hand looks good,'' said Dr. Warren Breidenbach, lead  
surgeon for the team that transplanted a hand to Matthew Scott's 
left wrist on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very cautious and not encouraging movement at this  
point. Controlled motion of the fingers will begin sometime in the 
next few days to one week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This week Scott traded a metal-and-plastic prosthesis for a  
human hand -- the first transplant of its kind performed in the 
United States. The price: a lifetime on anti-rejection drugs that 
will suppress his immune system, leaving him vulnerable to 
infection, disease, even death. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott, 37, lost his dominant hand in the explosion of an M-80, a  
powerful and illegal firecracker, on Dec. 23, 1985. He was given a 
donor hand in 14 1/2 hours of surgery Sunday and Monday at Jewish 
Hospital in Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
	Breidenbach said any number of complications could arise, some  
later than others, and that there was as much as a 50 percent 
chance Scott's body would reject the hand within a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of able-bodied people say, `Why put yourself at risk?  
You're doing so well,''' Scott told The Courier-Journal earlier 
this month in an interview. ``But this is a chance for me ... to 
get something back that is alive, that hopefully will be able to 
feel.''

<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Sometime in the next century humans may  
colonize the moon or Mars and researchers are looking for the 
plants and animals that those settlers from Earth will take with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a long-term habitation of Mars, you'll have to grow crops,  
deal with microbes and so forth,'' David Morrison of NASA's Ames 
Research Center said Monday. ``We have to understand the response 
of those organisms to the different conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Organisms that evolved in the gravity of Earth may not thrive in  
the lighter gravity of the moon or Mars, said NASA's Emily R. 
Morey-Holton. In the one-sixth gravity of the moon and the 
one-third gravity of Mars, there are changes in the fundamental 
processes of heat convection and sedimentation. Also, the surface 
tension of water, which shatters easily in Earth's gravity, becomes 
a strong barrier in lighter gravity and could affect basic 
biological functions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know the effect of these changes,'' Morey-Holton said  
at the national meeting of the American Association for the 
Advancement of Science. ``We have to learn if Earth organisms can 
live and evolve in these changed conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, Morey-Holton said, researchers found that tadpoles  
hatched in orbit never developed lungs. In the low gravity, the 
surface tension on air bubbles became so strong that the tadpoles 
could not punch through to breathe, she said. ``They would hit the 
bubbles and just bounce off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another orbital experiment, a type of mustard plant failed to  
thrive in space because water droplets clustered about the roots, 
blocking absorption of nutrients. Again, the cause is thought to be 
the enhanced surface tension of the water droplets. 
</P>
<P>
	Changes in gravity could also affect how genes work and could  
even affect evolution, Morey-Holton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some researchers are looking for gravity-dependent genes,''  
she said. ``There is concern that in a different gravity some genes 
may fail to turn on while others could shut down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such actions could dramatically alter a plant or animal or even  
cause lethal changes, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In one orbital experiment, several generations of human kidney  
cells were cultured and researchers have found that the genes in 
the space grown cells changed. Just how the changes would affect 
the cells is not known. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we find gravity-sensitive genes, there is no reason why we  
can't have designer organisms that would be viable in the new 
environment,'' said Morey-Holton. In effect, Earth plants or 
animals could be genetically altered so they would thrive in the 
changed conditions of Mars and would then be put on board a 
space-age ark that would carry colonists to the Red Planet. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is planning a  
series of experiments on the International Space Station to find 
Earth organisms best suited for Mars. Plants and animals will be 
grown through several generations and then analyzed for genetic 
changes, Morrison said.

<HEADLINE> Capano Brothers Plead for His Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Thomas Capano's brothers, whose  
testimony helped convince jurors to convict the once-prominent 
attorney of killing his mistress, pleaded Tuesday that their 
brother's life be spared. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask you please don't do this to our family,'' Gerard Capano  
said. ``Don't do this to his daughters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 18, a jury returned a guilty verdict against Capano, a  
former state prosecutor and high-profile political adviser. He was 
convicted of murdering Anne Marie Fahey, the governor's scheduling 
secretary, and dumping her body at sea. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury was expected to begin weighing life in prison versus  
execution after closing arguments Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This whole thing is horrible, horrible for the Faheys,  
horrible for us,'' said Gerard Capano, who spoke of the severe 
split in the close-knit Italian family that occurred after he 
became a government witness. 
</P>
<P>
	Another brother, Louis Capano, testified that Thomas asked him  
to dump trash bins at a construction site after he put a 
bloodstained sofa there. He tearfully asked that his brother's life 
be spared for the sake of his four daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Thomas Capano's ex-wife also said she wants him to  
live for his daughters. Kay Ryan adopted her maiden name last year 
after ending a 26-year marriage that was -- by Capano's own 
admission in court -- marked by numerous infidelities.

<HEADLINE>  Old Man Harper Ready To Lead Bulls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Ron Harper walked onto the court, looked  
around at the players milling about for the Chicago Bulls' media 
day and shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
	There's Bill Wennington, that's one player he knows. That guy  
over there is Martin ... Martin ... well, Martin Something. And 
that one is Charles ... ah, forget it. With all the Bulls' comings 
and goings, Harper was not even going to bother with the ``Hello, 
my name is ...'' game. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're used to calling out (certain) guys names and you're  
used to seeing them,'' Harper said Tuesday. ``I'm not used to 
seeing these guys just yet. It's only my third day here, so it's 
going to take awhile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's not the only one. In years past, the Bulls' media day was  
like a circus, with huge clusters of reporters and cameras fighting 
just to get in the same area code as Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen 
and Dennis Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, reporters clutched their rosters so they would know  
who that player was they had just interviewed. And instead of being 
able to hang back on the side, taking everything in, Harper was the 
main attraction Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The media day got cut down real, real big time,'' he said.  
``But we're a new team, we're not the old Bulls. We don't have the 
old guys here, so we have to get used to what we have here now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only starter left from last year's championship team, Harper  
better than anyone symbolized just how much Chicago has lost. The 
one player who was liked by everyone, he was close friends with 
Jordan and Pippen. The three often trained together at Jordan's 
house, and when His Airness decided to hang up his shoes, Harper 
and Pippen were the first teammates he told. 
</P>
<P>
	But now Jordan is on the golf course, Pippen is making big bucks  
in Houston and Harper is left behind to help rebuild. Picked as 
captain by new coach Tim Floyd, it falls to him to show the rookies 
and young guys what it takes to play at the championship level. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing I'll try to show them and try to tell them is  
in order to be a very good player, you must train hard,'' he said. 
``I knew this was going to be a very long year, so I trained hard 
and I expect to go out and play basketball. That's my plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he's got three championship rings, Harper's NBA career  
hasn't exactly been a romp. He was drafted by Cleveland, and he 
spent 4 1/2 seasons with the L.A. Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	At 35, he has seen the very good and the very bad.  
</P>
<P>
	``I asked Harper how old he was and I went 'Wow,''' said Roy  
Rogers, who came to the Bulls as part of the Rockets' 
sign-and-trade deal for Pippen. ``We're definitely going to turn to 
him for leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Grandfather Harper,'' Harper said with a laugh. ``That's me.''  
</P>
<P>
	Harper knows this won't be an easy season. Of the 20 players  
currently on the Bulls roster -- the list has to be pared to 14 by 
the start of the season -- only six have five or more years 
experience in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	And, after 10 years of being beaten up by the Bulls, the rest of  
the NBA is going to be looking to give back as good as it got. Who 
cares if Nos. 23 and 33 are gone? The uniform still says ``Bulls'' 
on the front.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Up Slightly at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks rose slightly Wednesday morning, while  
the dollar drifted lower against the yen amid renewed concern over 
trade friction between Japan and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 113.52 yen in late morning trading, down 0.04  
yen from its level late Tuesday in Tokyo and also slightly below 
its level of 113.82 yen in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average added 11.89 points, or 0.08 percent, to  
14,393.90 points at the end of the morning session. On Tuesday, the 
average rose 173.20 points, or 1.22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States announced Tuesday it is reviving a  
controversial procedure, known as Super-301, to impose stiff 
economic sanctions on countries judged to have erected trade 
barriers to American exports. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Japan's Finance Ministry said the nation's trade  
surplus with the rest of the world surged in 1998 to a record high. 
Japan's surplus with the United States increased as well, rising 
33.4 percent to $58.3 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 131.06 yen, down  
from 131.82 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks started the day's trading moderately higher, led by  
high-technology shares following an advance on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	But players did not expect further gains, since major bank  
issues were declining after several sessions of gains. 
</P>
<P>
	``As buying of financial shares ... has subsided, the market  
energy to go up is tapering off,'' said Masaru Arai, general 
manager of the stock division at Ryoko Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The market has been buoyed in recent days by bank shares, which  
have been boosted by reports of mergers and alliances between 
Japanese banks and banks' stepped-up efforts to write off bad 
debts. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section gained 0.99 points, or insignificant in percentage 
terms, to 1,110.87. The TOPIX closed up 11.17 points, or 1.02 
percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond  
rose to 1.740 percent from 1.715 percent late Tuesday, driving its 
price down to 100.48 yen from 100.68 yen.

<HEADLINE> Ovitz in Hollywood Tug of War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former superagent Michael Ovitz is in a tug  
of war for Hollywood talent with his former agency, and stars like 
Robin Williams and Claire Danes are caught in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
	Creative Artists Agency has told clients it will refuse to work  
with them if they remain with the Artists Management Group -- 
founded by Ovitz. 
</P>
<P>
	The message went to those jointly represented by CAA and Ovitz's  
new firm, including directors Sydney Pollack and Martin Scorsese 
and actresses Ms. Danes, Minnie Driver and Marisa Tomei. 
</P>
<P>
	Among CAA's other big-name clients are Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise and  
Steven Spielberg. 
</P>
<P>
	CAA says Ovitz, who has reincarnated himself as a manager, has  
clouded the line between manager and agent. 
</P>
<P>
	The feud between CAA and Ovitz's company erupted after Ovitz  
last week hired away leading CAA agent Michael Menchel. Among 
Menchel's clients was box-office superstar Williams (``Patch 
Adams,'' ``Good Will Hunting''), who left CAA with him. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, CAA returned the fire. Accusing AMG of acting  
``aggressively and hostilely,'' the agency is refusing to work with 
Ovitz. 
</P>
<P>
	``After having met with Ovitz on several occasions over the past  
several months to discuss the nature of our collaboration, he 
agreed not to raid our agents or clients, and he has violated his 
word,'' said Richard Lovett, CAA president and partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz was traveling and unavailable for comment, a spokeswoman  
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	One Hollywood veteran said CAA's action was understandable.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think CAA management made the only decision they could under  
the circumstances,'' said Roland Perkins, an original member of the 
William Morris Agency and of CAA, and now head of Double Eagle 
Productions. 
</P>
<P>
	There could be larger implications for the entertainment  
industry. Agents, who get jobs and negotiate deals for clients for 
a maximum 10 percent commission, are licensed by the state and 
regulated by industry guilds. 
</P>
<P>
	Such compensation limits do not apply to managers, although they  
are legally barred from seeking work for clients. Instead, their 
role has been to offer career guidance, with agents handling 
contract negotiations. Increasingly, though, managers are using 
lawyers to handle contract mechanics while they orchestrate the 
overall deal, legally circumventing agents altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	CAA contends that Ovitz's firm is acting less like a manager and  
more like an unlicensed agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz is used to controversy. At CAA, he was a supreme  
practitioner of packaging, in which an agency delivers the 
principal creative and acting talent for a movie or TV project as a 
client block. These all-or-nothing deals can include A-list 
clientele along with the agency's less-stellar talent. Some 
producers liken the practice to extortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz's tenure at Disney was characterized in a 1997  
stockholders' lawsuit as ``undistinguished and unproductive'' after 
Ovitz received a severance package reported to be up to $90 million 
for 14 months' work ending in 1996.

hasn't exactly been a romp. He was drafted by Cleveland, and he 
spent 4 1/2 seasons with the L.A. Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	At 35, he has seen the very good and the very bad.  
</P>
<P>
	``I asked Harper how old he was and I went 'Wow,''' said Roy  
Rogers, who came to the Bulls as part of the Rockets' 
sign-and-trade deal for Pippen. ``We're definitely going to turn to 
him for leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Grandfather Harper,'' Harper said with a laugh. ``That's me.''  
</P>
<P>
	Harper knows this won't be an easy season. Of the 20 players  
currently on the Bulls roster -- the list has to be pared to 14 by 
the start of the season -- only six have five or more years 
experience in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	And, after 10 years of being beaten up by the Bulls, the rest of  
the NBA is going to be looking to give back as good as it got. Who 
cares if Nos. 23 and 33 are gone? The uniform still says ``Bulls'' 
on the front.

<HEADLINE> Japan Banks Seek $70B in New Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's big banks plan to seek more than $70  
billion in new funds to prepare for possible losses on bad loans, 
several published reports said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen of Japan's top banks will ask for some $53 billion from  
a public fund created last year to strengthen the ailing financial 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	The planned requests are an increase over requests the banks  
announced two months ago, said the reports, released by the Yomiuri 
and Asahi newspapers and Kyodo News service. 
</P>
<P>
	The banks will also raise as much as $17.5 billion by selling  
stocks to affiliated companies or issuing shares, the reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many banks have nearly exhausted their financial reserves as  
they struggle to get out from under a pile of bad loans left from 
the collapse of real estate and stock prices early this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts estimate Japan's financial companies carry as much  
as $703 billion in bad or doubtful loans. 
</P>
<P>
	To steady the shaky financial system, the government set aside  
$219.8 billion in October, instructing banks to draw on the fund to 
strengthen their capital bases. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, fifteen top banks had said they would seek about  
$51 billion under the program. But since then, several banks have 
said they would ask for more. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuji Bank, for example, will likely ask for $8.8 billion, up  
from $6.1 billion, the reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuji will pass along the additional funds to Yasuda Trust and  
Banking. Fuji recently announced it will increase its investment in 
Yasuda. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Japan's Financial Supervisory Agency said no  
official figures on funding requests were available yet.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- An intestinal infection has forced  
Venezuelan President-elect Hugo Chavez to shorten a scheduled 
two-day visit to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The former coup leader probably will still meet with President  
Clinton Wednesday but canceled meetings with other top officials, 
congressmen and investors, said Alfredo Pena, Chavez's chief of 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip is important for Chavez, who had been barred from  
entering the United States because he led a failed 1992 coup 
attempt. The U.S. government dropped the ban after Chavez won a 
landslide victory Dec. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, 44, who has carried out a whirlwind round of trips in  
Latin America and Europe since winning, was ordered by his doctor 
to get as much bed rest as possible, Pena said. 
</P>
<P>
	Undersecretary of State Strobe Talbott and National Security  
Advisor Sandy Berger are expected to attend the meeting with Chavez 
and Clinton. After that, Chavez is to meet with Michel Camdessus, 
head of the International Monetary Fund.

	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- A Guatemalan judge has commuted a  
convicted kidnapper's death sentence to 50 years imprisonment, 
claiming capital punishment is illegal under an international 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Ruiz Wong, president of an appeals court, said Monday  
that Guatemala could not apply the death penalty because it had 
signed an Inter-American Commission on Human Rights treaty barring 
the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The kidnapper, Carlos Enrique Ruttiman Fonseca, 29, had been  
sentenced to death in October after being convicted in a 1996 
kidnapping. 
</P>

	Guatemalan prosecutors began seeking death penalties in 1996 to  
deal with rising crime; 28 inmates are now on death row.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Hundreds of people tried to lynch  
a Universal Church pastor they believed had raped a 14-year-old 
girl in Brazil, local media reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The mob invaded the church on Rio's poor northside Monday after  
the alleged victim's father told neighbors that the pastor had 
raped his daughter twice over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	According to newspaper reports, the girl's mother said the  
pastor had threatened to kill the girl and her family if she told 
of the rapes. 
</P>
<P>
	Police contained the crowd before they could reach the pastor,  
who was detained briefly but later released for lack of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The mob managed to break windows and smash pews before police  
intervened. One policeman was injured in the attack.

	Repeated calls to local police stations were unanswered.

	Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, chairman of the opposition  
Democratic Revolution Party, showed reporters bags of pasta and

	The packages were being distributed in the mountainous region of  
the Pacific Coast state of Guerrero, an area troubled by clashes

	The Guerrero state PRI press office declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Opposition parties have long accused the PRI of buying votes to  
maintain dominance throughout the 70 years it has governed Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Boxer Whitaker Shakes Off Cobwebs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pernell Whitaker defended Mike Tyson's comeback  
performance while predicting on Tuesday that a long layoff won't 
affect his showing against IBF welterweight champion Felix 
Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight Feb. 20 in Madison Square Garden will be the first in  
16 months for the 35-year-old former champion in four weight 
classes, who was troubled in 1998 by drug problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no ring rust on me,'' Whitaker said in conference call  
from San Antonio, Texas, where he is training. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, I've been in boxing 27 years. I don't want any excuses.  
There will be no excuses for this fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd never think he'd been out of the gym,'' said trainer  
Tommy Brooks, who also is Tyson's trainer. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks recently gave Tyson a C+ for his fifth-round knockout of  
Francois Botha Jan. 16 in Tyson's first fight in 19 months. A lot 
of observers felt Tyson looked rusty. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're spoiled on Mike Tyson,'' Whitaker told reporters.  
``You're used to seeing him knock out guys in one and two rounds. 
He gets four or five rounds of good work and knocks the guy out, 
and he don't get credit. That's not fair to Mike Tyson. It (the 
five rounds) is the best thing that could have happened to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his last fight, Oct. 17, 1997, Whitaker scored a 12-round  
decision over Andre Pestriaev that was supposed to set him up for a 
challenge to Ike Quartey, then WBA welterweight champion. Whitaker, 
however, tested positive for cocaine and was suspended for six 
months. In March 1998, Whitaker entered a drug and alcohol 
rehabilitation center. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about his substance abuse problems, Whitaker said,  
``That's last year. We're talking about Feb. 20. I'm not going 
back. I'm going forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker (41-2-1) lost the WBC welterweight title on a disputed  
decision April 12, 1997, to Oscar De La Hoya, who will defend his 
title against Quartey Feb. 20 at Las Vegas. Whitaker also has held 
the IBF-WBC-WBA lightweight titles, WBF junior welterweight and WBA 
junior middleweight titles.

<HEADLINE> Senate Urged To Call Witnesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In seeking testimony from Monica Lewinsky and  
others, House prosecutors hope to create momentum for their case 
and poke holes in President Clinton's defense. ``Look them in the 
eye,'' one prosecutor urged senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeing and hearing Ms. Lewinsky and other witnesses in person  
will help senators judge their credibility and resolve factual 
disputes, prosecutors told the Senate on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ms. Lewinsky would risk losing her immunity from prosecution  
if she changed her story during the impeachment trial and provided 
dramatic new information about her relationship with the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing they could get out of testimony by Monica  
Lewinsky would be large television ratings,'' said Georgetown law 
professor Louis Michael Seidman. That alone could help prosecutors, 
he added, because ``their only hope is to get people focused on it 
so that minds might change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Legal observers noted that the other witnesses sought by  
prosecutors -- presidential friend Vernon Jordan and White House 
aide Sidney Blumenthal -- are hostile to their case that the 
president broke the law in hiding his affair. Ms. Lewinsky's 
current views are not known, although she made a point of 
volunteering to a grand jury last summer that no one told her to 
lie or promised her a job in exchange for her denial of an affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors apparently are ``hoping that some of the witnesses  
such as Vernon Jordan would not be believed,'' said Northwestern 
University law professor Steven Lubet. 
</P>
<P>
	New York lawyer Bruce Yannett said the prosecutors might not get  
much new information, but ``by having live testimony (they could) 
create some momentum on their side and possibly rebut some specific 
factual points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a last-ditch, desperation move on their part,'' Yannett  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutor Bill McCollum, R-Fla., told senators that if  
Ms. Lewinsky testifies, ``she herself will convey this story to you 
in a way that it cannot be conveyed off a piece of paper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senators need to see how the witnesses respond to questioning,  
McCollum said, adding, ``Look them in the eye and make that 
determination yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., said Ms. Lewinsky could describe the  
``tone and tenor'' of her conversations with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The concealment of the gifts -- what really happened there? And  
the job search,'' he added. ``Wouldn't it be nice to hear Ms. 
Lewinsky's version of this?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors also want Ms. Lewinsky to testify about her  
discussions with Jordan about his efforts to help her find a job. 
They want Jordan to testify about when he knew the true nature of 
the relationship between Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	And they want to ask Blumenthal about his conversations with  
Clinton after the scandal broke publicly last January. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyer, David Kendall, said the prosecutors ``continue  
to hope that something will turn up for them.... They're simply 
gambling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors did not seek testimony from Clinton's private  
secretary, Betty Currie, who in December 1997 picked up from Ms. 
Lewinsky gifts that the president had given her. Ms. Lewinsky has 
testified that Mrs. Currie called her to arrange to pick up the 
gifts, while Mrs. Currie said she thought Ms. Lewinsky suggested 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Lubet, of Northwestern, said prosecutors might have decided not  
to seek Mrs. Currie's testimony because it could create doubt about 
the prosecution's case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Put the burden on the president to call her,'' Lubet said.  
``If the president calls her, the prosecution says, 'Believe 
Monica.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers hope she will not have to testify at all.  
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr promised her immunity from 
prosecution in exchange for her testimony, but he could seek to 
cancel the agreement if he believes she lied. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her entire immunity agreement is dependent on her having told  
the truth the first time,'' said lawyer Lawrence Fox of 
Philadelphia. ``Every time you open your mouth you put yourself at 
a little bit of risk.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls, Japan Stocks Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar fell against the yen Tuesday after  
a top Chinese official denied the yuan would be devalued. Japanese 
stocks edged higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 113.56 yen at late afternoon, down 0.78 yen  
from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 
113.96 yen overnight. The dollar ranged from 113.30 yen to 113.93 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Following an overnight slip in New York, the dollar weakened  
slightly in Tokyo but stayed in a narrow range. Traders continued 
to avoid taking new positions amid uncertainty about the economic 
situation in Brazil, South America's largest economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 173.20 points,  
or 1.22 percent, ending the day at 14,382.01 points. On Monday, the 
average closed up 54.41 points, or 0.38 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar, which had strengthened Friday and early Monday in  
part because of rumors of an impending Chinese devaluation, fell 
back after Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji announced the yuan would 
remain stable in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Market players shrugged off other news Tuesay, including the  
downgrades by Moody's Investors Service of the long-term deposit 
ratings at several big Japanese banks, as old news, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've gotten into the phase now where all the market-moving  
news has been factored in and we have to wait for the next 
developments,'' said Yukihiko Hashimoto, senior foreign exchange 
manager at Sanwa Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 131.82 yen, down  
from 132.70 yen late Monday but up from 131.65 yen in New York late 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices ended higher on Wall Street's  
overnight gains and active buying of blue chips by institutional 
investors who manage public and pension funds, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also helping the stock market was an announcement Monday by the  
Financial Reconstruction Commission that major Japanese banks will 
be required to make provisions covering 70 percent of their 
unguaranteed loans to companies that ``may go bankrupt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules will apply to ``international class'' banks which  
apply for public funds under the government's plan to recapitalize 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting rid of the massive bad debts held by banks is considered  
a major step in helping Japan's recession-hit economy get back on 
track. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section gained 11.17 points, or 1.02 percent, to 1,109.88. 
The TOPIX closed up 1.42 points, or 0.13 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section was estimated at 500 million shares,  
up from 396.15 million shares Monday. Advancing issues outnumbered 
retreaters 828 to 335, with 138 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese  
government bond fell to 1.715 percent from 1.780 percent late 
Monday. Its price rose to 100.68 yen from 100.16 yen.

<HEADLINE> Barkley Rejoins Rockets at Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Although he doesn't like two-a-day workouts,  
Charles Barkley gets better compliments about his basketball game 
than his golf game. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley put away his golf clubs Monday and joined new teammate  
Scottie Pippen and the rest of the Houston Rockets to prepare for 
tonight's exhibition opener against the San Antonio Spurs in Compaq 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley missed the Rockets' first four practices while playing  
in the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic in California. But he was back at 
work Monday, catching barbs from teammates about his unorthodox 
golf swing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a chance to play golf with Michael Jordan in Palm  
Springs or go to two-a-days,'' Barkley said. ``That's a no-brainer. 
Some guy said `You're not a very good golfer,' and I told him 
imagine how good I'll be in two-a-days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Eddie Johnson suggested Barkley was allowed to play in  
the tournament as comic relief. Matt Bullard added: ``I think he 
set the game of golf back about 500 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, his teammates were happy to see Barkley back in uniform  
and healthy. He had off-season elbow and hernia operations, but 
reported Monday saying he felt ready to play basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Rudy Tomjanovich didn't even complain about Barkley's late  
arrival. Instead, he praised Barkley for signing at the $1 million 
minimum salary, freeing enough money to sign Pippen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how many players would do what he's done,''  
Tomjanovich said. ``His plan was to explore his options, which is 
his right. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he found out he was the pivotal guy in us getting  
Scottie, he scrapped that whole plan. He made a sacrifice for this 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's practice took on more flare than previous drills.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to have him back. There's a little more noise around  
here,'' Tomjanovich said. ``We had competitive workouts before, but 
when he is here it's stepped up. He's so competitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What happens on the golf course is another matter. After  
practice someone wrote on the locker room blackboard: ``Everyone 
join together and give the world's best amateur golfer, Sir 
Charles, a hand!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, I come in here and they've all got tired legs,'' Barkley  
said. ``Me, I feel very refreshed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Barkley joining Pippen and Hakeem Olajuwon, the Rockets  
again have three players who were voted among the top 50 in NBA 
history. Clyde Drexler, who retired after last season, also is on 
the list. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to have him here so he can get accustomed to the  
new players, namely myself and the other guys,'' Pippen said. ``We 
have to know how Charles plays and where he likes his spacing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley, who missed 14 games with injuries last season, was done  
for good after tearing his right triceps after colliding with 
Utah's Greg Foster in a first-round playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	His average of 15.2 points was his lowest since averaging 14 as  
a rookie in 1984-85. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was a nightmare with two hernias,'' Barkley said.  
``I was disappointed the way I played because I never felt good 
physically. Now, I've got all my physical ailments out of the way 
and I'm going to have a great season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets didn't hold their first workouts until Saturday  
because of delays in completing Pippen's contract. Tomjanovich 
wished for more time to get ready for the first of two exhibition 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It (Tuesday's game) is like a practice and not a good practice  
because I can only work five guys at a time,'' he said. ``I'd like 
those guys to come over and scrimmage for about 10 quarters.''

<HEADLINE> Compaq To Sell Stock in AltaVista </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp. wants AltaVista, its  
Web-search service, to conduct a new type of search: Find riches on 
the World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining a race to cash in on the Internet stock boom, Compaq on  
Tuesday announced plans to spin off its AltaVista subsidiary into a 
separate, publicly owned company. Proceeds from the stock sale 
could help AltaVista strike deals with other Web companies and 
expand into a bigger Internet destination, offering everything from 
financial information to shopping. 
</P>
<P>
	That could help Compaq, which is already the No. 1 seller of  
personal computers, sell even more PCs. By luring more visitors to 
AltaVista, Compaq could draw shoppers to its own site and begin to 
catch up in online sales with archrival Dell Computer Corp., which 
sells more than $10 million worth of PCs a day over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	An autonomous AltaVista will be freer to enter agreements with  
rivals to Compaq, said Chris Lochhead, chief marketing officer at 
Scient Corp., a San Francisco-based electronic-commerce consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	``The competitiors in their market space have innovated much  
more rapidly and moved much more quickly,'' he said. ``This now 
unleashes them so they can be more like their competitors from that 
point of view.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq is the latest company to try to exploit investors'  
seemingly insatiable demand for stocks with a ``.com'' suffix, 
which gives Web firms valuable currency for snapping up other 
companies. Walt Disney Co. two weeks ago saw its stock soar after 
detailing plans for a new Web site it developed with Internet 
search engine Infoseek, ratcheting up the competition with 
AltaVista, Yahoo and other popular Internet locations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe it's the most effective way to achieve (our)  
business objective,'' Compaq chief executive Eckhard Pfeiffer said 
at a press announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	The spinoff plans announced Tuesday pushed Compaq's stock up  
nearly 6 percent in trading on the New York Stock Exchange, rising 
2.56 1/4 to close at $49.25. 
</P>
<P>
	AltaVista offers a widely used search engine and a variety of  
other options, including news, stock quotes and shopping services, 
and took in about $40 million in revenue last year. But it ranked 
No. 12 among Web sites last month, lagging Yahoo, Excite, Lycos and 
other top destinations, according to the Media Metrix research 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The spinoff plans eased intense speculation over Compaq's plans  
for AltaVista, which it bought as part of its $9 billion 
acquisition of Digital Equipment Corp. last year. Compaq was said 
to be shopping around for another leading Web destination. The 
spinoff plans seem to make an outright purchase less likely, 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	AltaVista could raise from $2 billion to $5 billion in an  
initial public offering, giving it money to strike deals with other 
Web firms and possibly acquire lesser-known Web companies, said 
Piper Jaffrey Inc. analyst Ashok Kumar. But the stratospheric 
market capitalization of some firms could limit AltaVista's ability 
to buy better-known Internet companies. 
</P>
<P>
	One possibility is for AltaVista to use its stock proceeds to  
enter a cross-marketing arrangement with an Internet service 
provider, such as a big telephone company, which could make 
AltaVista the default Internet destination for its subscribers. In 
return, AltaVista could use its Web site to advertise the Internet 
provider's services. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of Tuesday's announcement, Compaq said it reached a deal  
with Microsoft Corp. for AltaVista to become the primary search 
engine on the software company's online service, the Microsoft 
Network. The stock of Inktomi Corp., Microsoft's current Web search 
engine, tumbled after news that AltaVista would replace it. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq officials would not say when the offering might occur,  
but the announcement comes at a time of ferocious demand for 
Internet-related stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The first initial public offering of 1999, online financial news  
provider MarketWatch.com, soared 474 percent. MarketWatch followed 
the pattern of skyrocketing offerings last year from such companies 
as Web page provider theglobe.com, online auctioneer eBay.com, and 
Ticketmaster Online-CitySearch Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The newly formed AltaVista Corp. will be based in Palo Alto,  
Calif., and headed by Rod Schrock, who has been senior vice 
president of Compaq's consumer product group. Schrock led Compaq's 
recent acquisition of Shopping.com, a popular shopping Web site.

<HEADLINE> GAO Says Government Results Uneven </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For years, government agencies were  
preoccupied with action -- projects and programs, grants and 
inspections. Today, the buzz word is ``results,'' and while every 
agency has made some strides, Congress' investigative arm reported 
Monday that progress is uneven and much work remains. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office issued 22 reports assessing the  
U.S. government's shift to a management approach that focuses on 
performance, not just activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``For years, people in government have said `Here's what I'm  
going to do,''' says Carlotta Joyner, a division director at the 
GAO. ``The real question is `Did it do any good?' You really need 
to focus on the results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reports, done at the request of 10 members of Congress,  
reviewed management, technology, personnel and financial challenges 
at 20 agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``While every agency we have examined has made progress in  
becoming more performance-based, the pace and degree of that 
progress has been uneven across agencies,'' an overview of the 
reports said. ``A great deal of hard and sustained work remains to 
be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congress passed legislation last year to get federal agencies to  
make decisions with an eye toward performance and results. But the 
GAO said many agencies, with fuzzy goals and outmoded 
organizational charts, continue to struggle with the ``basic tenets 
of performance-based management.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Agencies such as the Department of Energy need clearer lines  
of authority and accountability to better ensure public health and 
safety,'' the overview said. ``And agencies, such as the Department 
of Agriculture and the Department of Defense, need to streamline 
organizational structures to better meet agency missions and 
conserve resources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Closing military bases, for instance, helps reduce excess  
capacity within the services, but the GAO said considerable 
duplication still exists across the Defense Department. 
</P>
<P>
	There's overlap outside the military too, it said: ``As many as  
12 different agencies administer over 35 different laws overseeing 
food safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other areas, partnerships between federal and state agencies  
would yield the best results, the GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
	States and the Environmental Protection Agency, for example, use  
different methods to collect water quality data, making it 
difficult to determine whether the quality of rivers, lakes and 
streams is getting better or worse. 
</P>
<P>
	To modernize finances at the agencies, Congress passed  
legislation requiring some 24 agencies to prepare annual audited 
financial statements starting with the 1996 fiscal year. Eleven of 
the agencies received favorable audit opinions for fiscal 1997 -- up 
from six for fiscal 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO also said agencies need to align workers to achieve  
results, highlighting manpower problems at the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
	During the first term of the Clinton administration, HUD sought  
to trim its staff from about 13,500 to 7,500 by 2002. The GAO, 
however, criticized the agency, saying its targets were not based 
on how many employees it needed to carry out various functions. 
</P>
<P>
	In March 1998, HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo responded, revising  
the staff cutbacks to 9,000 employees. ``The secretary said we 
couldn't go to 7,500 and adequately carry out our mission,'' said 
HUD spokesman David Egner. 
</P>
<P>
	``This weakness in HUD's human capital planning is particularly  
troubling because, in the past, not having enough staff with the 
necessary skills has limited HUD's ability to perform essential 
functions, such as monitoring multibillion-dollar federal 
programs,'' the GAO reported.

<HEADLINE>  Brazil's Real Dips, Then Recovers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The Brazilian currency swung  
wildly Tuesday, as markets waited for a government intervention 
that never came. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's currency initially nosedived Tuesday, as traders pushed  
the Central Bank to sell dollars. The real tumbled to 1.96 to the 
dollar from 1.79 on Monday, before closing at 1.82 before dipping 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	Currency dealers said the real plummeted because buyers wanted  
to discover at what point the government would step in and sell 
dollars to prop it up. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Central Bank said it would allow the real to  
float against the dollar but might intervene to avert sudden 
changes, a system economists call a ``dirty float.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the government did just that, selling dollars through  
the federally run Banco do Brasil to halt a free fall. But there 
was no sign of intervention on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There definitely are people forcing the Central Bank's hand,''  
said one Rio de Janeiro trader speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Late in the day, several banks sold dollars when the rate was  
around 1.90 and the real bounced back up. But dealers say banks are 
almost out of dollars, which raises the demand and the pressure on 
the Central Bank to sell. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil stopped spending its dollar reserves to support the real  
after losing more than $45 billion since August, as panicky 
investors bailed out of Latin America's largest economy. 
</P>
<P>
	But dollars continue flowing out, despite a 38 percent  
devaluation of the real since Jan. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Central Bank President Francisco Lopes said $8 billion has left  
the country this month and that reserves stand at about $36 
billion, including $9 billion from a $41.5 billion aid package from 
international lenders. 
</P>
<P>
	At his confirmation hearing at the Senate, Lopes said that  
Brazil must raise money abroad this year or reserves will fall to 
$24 billion in 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopes called the current market jitters ``exaggerated'' and said  
the initial plunge of the real isn't something to worry about. He 
said there was no chance Brazil would restrict the outflow of 
dollars because foreign credit and investment would vanish. 
</P>
<P>
	``Currency controls would mean that Brazil would be abandoning  
the possibility of becoming a first-class nation,'' Lopes said. 
``Currency controls are a non-solution ... and inevitably lead a 
country to moratorium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the abrupt plunge of the real has raised fears of renewed  
inflation, for decades the scourge of Brazil's economy. The strong 
real, introduced in 1994, cut inflation from 2,700 percent to less 
than 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The government hopes to curb inflation by keeping credit tight,  
so merchants will have to cut prices to attract customers. The 
Central Bank now charges 32.5 percent interest on loans to banks. 
</P>
<P>
	But high interest rates also raise the government's public  
deficit and a domestic debt that tops 350 billion reals, now worth 
about $180 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the weaker real was good news for local stock markets, as  
foreign investors went fishing for bargains. The Sao Paulo Stock 
Exchange, Latin America's largest, closed up 6.3 percent from 
Monday's close.

<HEADLINE> Possible Tampering With Kosovo Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Finnish forensic experts  
investigating how 45 ethnic Albanian villagers were killed may be 
unable to determine whether they were massacred or shot in battle 
because of the possibility of evidence-tampering, the lead 
pathologist said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The remarks by Helena Ranta suggest the world may never learn  
for sure the truth of the Racak village killings, which sparked 
international outrage and renewed calls for NATO action against the 
government of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. chief of the international peace monitors, William  
Walker, has accused Serb police of killing the civilians and called 
the slayings a massacre. Yugoslav authorities claim the dead were 
rebels killed in battle. They ordered Walker expelled for his 
comments but froze the order after strong international pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranta stressed Tuesday that she was not accusing anyone of  
tampering with the bodies, but said the possibility could not be 
ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies, including a boy and three women, were moved without  
supervision -- first by ethnic Albanians to a mosque in Racak and 
later by Serb police to the Pristina morgue. In addition, Ranta 
said Yugoslav authorities had already conducted autopsies on about 
a third of the bodies before her team arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem as we see it, it is difficult to reconstruct the  
`chain of custody' over the bodies,'' she said. ``There is a 
possibility of contamination and a possibility of fabrication of 
evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ranta said some of the bodies tested positive on paraffin tests,  
indicating they may have fired a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	But paraffin tests are widely discounted in U.S. courts because  
tobacco and fertilizers often give the same results as gunpowder. 
The dead were mostly farmers in a region where smoking is nearly 
universal among males. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief prosecutor for the international war crimes tribunal  
for Yugoslavia, Louise Arbour, said last week she would take very 
seriously any evidence of tampering with the bodies. She said such 
an act could be seen as displaying ``consciousness of guilt'' by 
the perpetrator. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav authorities have permitted the Finnish team, sponsored  
by the European Union, to examine the bodies but have refused to 
permit the U.N. war crimes tribunal to conduct an on-site 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav Justice Minister Zoran Knezevic said Tuesday that the  
government would allow Arbour to visit Belgrade -- she was denied 
entry into the country three times last week -- but her conducting 
an investigation in Kosovo was ``out of the question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav health minister, Miodrag Kovac, told reporters in  
Pristina that based on the Yugoslavs' examination of 37 bodies so 
far, ``I can only say that all the injuries were caused by firearms 
and from a distance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,000 people have been killed and up to 300,000 driven  
from their homes since Serb forces launched an offensive last 
February against separatists in Kosovo, an Albanian-majority 
province in Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia. Most in Kosovo 
want independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat of NATO airstrikes and an Oct. 12 cease-fire stopped  
most fighting between Yugoslav and Serb forces and the separatists. 
But the violence has increased in recent weeks, culminating in the 
apparent massacre Jan. 15 in Racak. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, five other ethnic Albanians, two of them children,  
were discovered shot to death in a field southwest of Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo Albanians said the civilians were shot by Serb police;  
Serb authorities denied it, noting the bodies were found in 
territory controlled by rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serb-run government information office in Kosovo on Tuesday  
charged the five were killed by the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army in 
a ``reprisal ... against those who would not obey them and serve 
crime and separatism.'' The KLA has in the past attacked ethnic 
Albanians it accuses of sympathizing with Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo rebels, meanwhile, laid down their terms Tuesday for  
joining international peace talks, as British Foreign Secretary 
Robin Cook finalized plans for a conference to negotiate a 
long-term settlement for Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	British officials, speaking Tuesday on condition of anonymity,  
said if the fractious Kosovo Albanian leadership could not put 
together a common negotiating team, the conference would proceed 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy was aimed at forcing the ethnic Albanians,  
including the KLA, to end months of haggling among themselves and 
begin dealing with Milosevic's government. 
</P>
<P>
	The KLA has refused to acknowledge the leadership of moderate  
politician Ibrahim Rugova, whose nonviolent approach in the 
struggle for independence has won favor in Washington and European 
capitals. 
</P>
<P>
	The KLA announced Tuesday night on Albanian television plans to  
establish a ``constituent assembly'' to rival one presided over by 
Rugova.

<HEADLINE> $4B Sought To Combat Global Warming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, stymied in getting  
quick acceptance of the Kyoto climate treaty, will seek $4 billion 
next year to pursue an ``aggressive, commonsense'' policy that 
addresses the threat of global warming. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials disclosed late Monday that President  
Clinton intends to propose as part of his next budget sharp 
increases in climate-change related spending and tax breaks in 
hopes of reducing the flow of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore said the additional spending, which is  
expected to meet stiff resistance in Congress, represents 
``significant new investments ... to accelerate our aggressive, 
commonsense efforts to meet the challenge of global warming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals will be part of the fiscal 2000 budget the  
president will send to Congress next month. 
</P>
<P>
	A linchpin of the climate initiative will be a plan to create a  
$200 million ``clean air partnership fund'' that would be used to 
generate millions of dollars more in state and private funds to 
help reduce greenhouse gases, chiefly carbon dioxide from burning 
fossil fuels. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior White House official said the money, which in many  
cases will be tied to promises of state matching funds, can be used 
for a wide variety of programs from retrofitting buildings to 
purchasing more fuel-efficient or cleaner burning vehicles. Some of 
the funds would be used to promote public-private partnerships to 
reduce greenhouse gases, including voluntary efforts by companies 
to improve energy efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration will argue to Congress that the funds will be  
earmarked for programs that not only address climate change, but 
also reduce urban smog and other air pollution by reducing 
emissions from automobiles or coal-burning power plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The initiative will help states and communities meet tougher  
smog requirements and other clean air rules being developed by the 
Environmental Protection Agency, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Efforts to address global warming can at the same time help to  
protect public health,'' said Gore of the new spending programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton alluded to the clean air fund in his State of the Union  
address last week, but provided no details. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also is proposing $105 million, more than  
double the current levels, for research into how agriculture and 
forests can offset greenhouse gas emissions by absorbing carbon 
dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the climate package -- including proposals for more than  
$1.4 billion in tax incentives -- are aimed at promoting energy 
efficiency and spurring developing of new energy technologies to 
reduce the reliance on fossil fuels. 
</P>
<P>
	These include:  
</P>
<P>
	--$1.4 billion in spending for research and development into more  
energy-efficient technologies and renewable energy programs such as 
solar and wind power, a 34 percent increase over such spending this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	--Tax credits for purchase of ultra-energy-efficient homes or  
energy-efficient equipment, or for the purchase of electric, hybrid 
or fuel cell vehicles expected to begin hitting showrooms over the 
next few years. 
</P>
<P>
	--$122 million to spur technology for cleaner burning, coal-fired  
power plants. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar package of research dollars and tax incentives was  
proposed last year, but stalled in Congress amid charges from 
Republican critics that the administration was trying to implement 
the Kyoto accord without it first being sent to Congress for 
ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional opposition, especially among Republicans leery of  
the Kyoto climate agreement, is likely to be strong again this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Sen. Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign  
Affairs Committee, demanded that the White House send the Kyoto 
climate treaty up for ratification, sure that such an attempt would 
fail. Administration officials have said they don't expect the 
treaty to be submitted to Congress until after the 2000 election.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Pope Meet for Fourth Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	St. LOUIS (AP) -- A president living through a modern morality  
play met today with the spiritual leader of the world's Roman 
Catholics. But Pope John Paul II was more concerned with what he 
termed a ``time of trial'' for American culture than the 
impeachment trial against President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The pontiff also made oblique reference in prepared remarks to  
the errant U.S. missile attack in Iraq, which he had condemned 
through a spokesman a day earlier, but he dropped them from his 
speech before delivery. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking frail, the 78-year-old pope walked slowly into an Air  
National Guard hangar draped with blue curtains where he met the 
president and Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members of the welcoming committee, which included Clinton  
Cabinet and White House staff, and state, local and church 
officials, knelt to kiss the pope's ring. His left hand trembled as 
he held the gold cross hanging from his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton praised John Paul for his efforts to promote peace and  
compassion for the less fortunate around the globe with ``a 
boundless physical energy which can only find its source in 
limitless faith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of a century Clinton said had seen ``much  
suffering, but which ends with much hope for freedom and 
reconciliation,'' the president honored John Paul for his past 
stands against communism and his defense of human rights from 
Africa to the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	``People still need to hear your message that all are God's  
children, all have fallen short of his glory,'' Clinton said. ``All 
of the injustices of yesterday cannot excuse a single injustice 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pope, likening the current debates over abortion and  
euthanasia to the fight against slavery and racism over the past 
century, said, ``America faces a similar time of trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, the conflict is between a culture that affirms,  
cherishes and celebrates the gift of life, and a culture that seeks 
to declare entire groups of human beings ... considered 'unuseful' 
to be outside the boundaries of legal protection,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's visit marks the fourth time Clinton has met with the  
pontiff, and the first since the Monica Lewinsky scandal became 
public and led to the Senate impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was meeting with the pope for 45 minutes after a  
welcoming ceremony at a St. Louis airport hangar. White House 
officials said Iraq, Cuba and human rights were on the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope didn't mention Iraq directly during the welcoming  
ceremony, but his prepared text referred to ``rejecting violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To choose life,'' the speech read, ``involves rejecting every  
form of violence: the violence of poverty and hungr, which 
oppresses so many human beings; the violence of armed conflict 
which does not resolve but only increases divisions and tensions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Clinton, a Southern Baptist, has sought spiritual guidance  
from several ministers in recent months, there was no indication he 
would touch the Lewinsky theme today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president enjoys carrying on a dialogue with one of the  
pre-eminent religious leaders in the world,'' White House spokesman 
Joe Lockhart said. ``He will discuss issues of mutual concern, 
including human rights around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm certain the situation in Iraq, the situation in Cuba,  
which the pope has expressed particular interest in, will be part 
of the discussion,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that those will be simple issues to deal with. The pope has  
been critical of the U.S. strikes and U.N. sanctions against Iraq, 
and he did so again Monday following a U.S. missile attack in 
southern Iraq during which civilians were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope also has criticized the economic embargo against Cuba.  
</P>
<P>
	But there is much common ground, especially in the area of human  
rights. On his recent visit to Cuba, John Paul stressed the need 
for freedom and a rebirth of spiritual values on the island. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mexico, the pope stressed that the church speaks to the  
prosperous as well as to the poor.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Trial Tests Lott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The impeachment trial of President Clinton has  
become a test for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott as well. As the 
drama plays out, he is confronting daily decisions that could 
affect the Republican Party and his own political future. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the Senate commenced its proceedings Jan. 7,  
opposing forces within the party were tugging at the Mississippi 
Republican. Many conservatives have demanded a full-blown effort to 
remove Clinton from office, while pragmatists have worried that GOP 
candidates could pay in the 2000 elections if the trial of the 
broadly popular president is seen as partisan or stretches too 
long. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senator Lott is really an acrobat juggling tomahawks on  
fire,'' said Ralph Reed, a GOP consultant and former executive 
director of the Christian Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are 60 nuances a day where everyone could disagree,''  
said Ed Rogers, a long-time Republican operative who has informally 
been giving Lott advice. ``Every day, it's a question of picking 
the least worst options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott got off to a shaky start. Before the trial began, he said  
he didn't believe witnesses would be required. He also seemed to 
endorse an early proposal by Sens. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., and 
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., that could have ended the entire trial 
in a week without witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	He backed away from both after they drew fire from many GOP  
senators, the 13 House Republican managers prosecuting the case 
against Clinton and outside conservative groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Those missteps recalled past clashes he has had since becoming  
Senate majority leader in June 1996. A conservative at heart but 
deal-maker by nature, Lott has been lambasted by conservatives for 
his role in passing a chemical weapons treaty and budget-balancing 
deal in 1997 and a huge spending bill late in 1998, plus the GOP 
failure to win tax cuts last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But since his unsteady beginning, Lott has drawn mostly good --  
though wary -- reviews from Republicans of all stripes in helping 
guide the Senate through a process untraversed since the 1868 
impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were upset when they saw that first proposal,'' said  
Marty Dannenfelser, lobbyist for the conservative Family Research 
Council. ``But there's been more of a feeling lately that he's been 
holding the line more strongly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's acquitted himself well to date,'' said Sen. Gordon Smith,  
R-Ore. ``I really have sympathy for his effort. Trent Lott is our 
leader, but we are not his employees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, Lott has played a subtler leadership role. He  
has privately told GOP colleagues he will not twist their arms to 
influence their decisions, participants say. Instead of guiding 
colleagues to decisions, he has been letting them reach a consensus 
before embracing it, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	He also has avoided criticism by letting other senators float  
trial balloons about whether and how witnesses should be called and 
the steps that the proceedings should take. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he's been open to shortening the process, Lott has been  
clear in his overall goal: Move expeditiously to a final vote on 
the two articles of impeachment against Clinton, subject to a 
change in Senate sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The process calls for us to go through what the Constitution,  
the rules provide, and that is to go through debate,'' Lott said 
this week. ``I don't think anybody has come up with an idea, a 
justification for anything short of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's decisions are crucial for a GOP whose Senate control  
could be at stake in 2000. Nineteen Republican incumbents face 
re-election next year, including 13 from states that Clinton 
carried in 1996, many in the moderate Northeast and Midwest. Lott 
himself faces re-election next year, but is considered sure to win. 
</P>
<P>
	He also must weigh the impact his decisions will have on  
conservative voters, who dominate Republican presidential 
primaries, particularly any steps that could be viewed as letting 
Clinton off the hook. That includes making sure the charges are not 
dismissed prematurely and without witnesses, conservatives say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans are looking to him to put deeds behind the words  
that everyone is equal under the laws,'' said Randy Tate, executive 
director of the Christian Coalition. ``Senator Lott has to ensure 
that this process is fair, and President Clinton is not allowed to 
skate in a way no other Americans could do.''

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Currency Plunges Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- How low can the real go?  
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's currency nosedived once again on Tuesday, as markets  
pushed the Central Bank to sell dollars. The real fell to 1.96 to 
the dollar from 1.79 on Monday before strengthening slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	Currency dealers said buyers were apparently trying to determine  
at what point the government would step in and sell dollars to prop 
up the real. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Central Bank said it would allow the real to  
float against the dollar but might intervene to avert sudden 
changes, a system economists call a ``dirty float.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the government did just that, selling dollars through  
the federally run Banco do Brasil to halt a free fall. But there 
was no sign of intervention on Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealers said banks were almost out of dollars, which raises the  
demand and the pressure on the Central Bank to sell. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil stopped spending its dollar reserves to support the real  
after losing more than $45 billion since August, as panicky 
investors bailed out of Latin America's largest economy. 
</P>
<P>
	But dollars continue flowing out, despite a 38 percent  
devaluation of the real since Jan. 12. Some $8 billion has left the 
country this month, Central Bank President Francisco Lopes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The abrupt plunge of the real has raised fears of renewed  
inflation, for decades the scourge of Brazil's economy. The strong 
real, introduced in 1994, cut inflation from 2,700 percent to less 
than 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The government hopes to curb inflation by keeping credit tight,  
so merchants will have to cut prices to attract customers. The 
Central Bank now charges 32.5 percent interest on loans to banks. 
</P>
<P>
	But high interest rates also raise the government's public  
deficit and a domestic debt that tops 350 billion reals, now worth 
about $180 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the weaker real was good news for local stock markets, as  
foreign investors went fishing for bargains. The Sao Paulo Stock 
Exchange, Latin America's largest, was up 5.6 percent in early 
trading.

<HEADLINE> Texas Family Found Asphyxiated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- A man recently accused of abusing his  
two sons died early Tuesday, along with the boys, his wife and 
their dog, in an old Chevy with a hose running from the exhaust 
pipe into the car. 
</P>
<P>
	Police began investigating the case as a murder-suicide after  
pulling aside a cover on the idling car and finding the family 
inside, asphyxiated. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents were identified as unemployed 33-year-old Armando  
Nunez and Valree Nunez, 28, a sales clerk. Their children were 
Curtis, 7, and Robert, 4. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys were lying on their backs in the rear seat, clad in  
their underwear. Nunez was fully clothed in the driver's seat, and 
the hose on his side of the car led investigators to believe he 
orchestrated the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chevrolet Caprice had a flat rear tire and was parked behind  
the new duplex where the family lived, on a hill in a blue-collar 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found freshly used hamburger wrappers, a bottle of  
whiskey and cigarettes inside the car. There were pillows in the 
back for the children. Mrs. Nunez had her purse with her in the 
front seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors said they didn't realize there was trouble in the  
family until Nunez's Jan. 11 arrest on an outstanding traffic 
warrant. That same day, state workers began investigating his sons' 
complaints that he had physically and sexually abused them. 
</P>
<P>
	Marleigh Meissner, a spokeswoman for Child Protective Services,  
said Ms. Nunez kicked her husband out, sent the children to live 
with relatives and changed the locks on the house. Ms. Meissner 
said the investigation into the abuse charges had not been 
completed.

<HEADLINE> Estrogen Helps Keep Hearts Healthy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Estrogen supplements not only improve a woman's  
cholesterol levels but reduce other substances in the blood that 
raise the risk of a heart attack or stroke, researchers reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers found that giving healthy women estrogen or estrogen  
combined with cholesterol-lowering drugs was associated with 
reduced inflammatory and clotting factors in the blood, said Dr. 
Richard Cannon III, the lead author of the study in today's issue 
of Circulation, a journal of the American Heart Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Such factors contribute to the clogging of blood vessels, said  
Cannon, acting chief of the National Heart, Lung and Blood 
Institute's cardiology branch. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers believe that hormone replacement therapy, especially  
estrogen, can help fend off the ravages of aging and related 
diseases. It has been shown to reduce the ``bad'' low-density 
cholesterol (LDL) and raise the ``good'' high-density cholesterol 
(HDL). But cholesterol is just one of many contributors to vessel 
clogging. 
</P>
<P>
	Some studies suggest its benefits even extend to protecting  
against Alzheimer's disease. According to a 1998 study at Mt. Sinai 
Hospital in New York, a dwindling number of cells in the 
hippocampus is linked to low estrogen levels. The hippocampus is a 
region of the brain involved with memory. 
</P>
<P>
	But estrogen replacement therapy carries risks, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Studies show it can increase the risk of breast cancer and  
endometrial cancer because the hormone can fuel the rampant growth 
of abnormal cells in some tissues. 
</P>
<P>
	And, elevated levels of the hormone can block the effects of  
tamoxifen, a powerful but controversial cancer drug that has been 
used for 20 years in advanced cases of breast cancer and other 
forms of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest study, the researchers examined cholesterol  
levels, clotting factors and inflammation in blood samples from 28 
women who were an average age of 57 and had relatively high levels 
of LDL. The women received three treatments, each for six weeks: 
estrogen, the cholesterol-lowering drug simvastatin and a 
combination of the two. 
</P>
<P>
	One test measured plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1),  
which blocks the body's ability to dissolve blood clots and is an 
indicator of blood clotting. Another test was for E-selectin, a 
molecule whose levels indicate inflammation. 
</P>
<P>
	After estrogen treatment, levels of PAI-1 were reduced by about  
40 percent. With combination treatment, the levels fell 24 percent. 
But the levels were unchanged after simvastatin treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar results occurred for E-selectin. With combination  
treatment and with estrogen treatment alone, E-selectin levels were 
reduced by about 20 percent. With simvastatin alone, the levels 
were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Further study is needed, according to one scientist who wasn't  
involved in the research. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although the effect of estrogen on markers of inflammation and  
clotting in the study are encouraging, it's uncertain how these 
results will translate into a reduction in heart attacks and other 
clinical events,'' said Dr. JoAnn Manson, an endocrinologist at 
Harvard University and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The only large-scale test results available are from the Heart  
Estrogen Replacement Study, which looked at women who had a history 
of cardiovascular disease, Manson said. The trials showed that 
women with prior cardiovascular diseases who were treated with 
estrogen and progestin actually showed an increase in heart attacks 
in the first year of treatment.

<HEADLINE> Falcons' Dwight Takes on Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- After weaving through interstate traffic at 160 mph  
on a motorcycle and leaping off a cliff into frigid water, looking 
up to catch a punt while 11 men are intent on causing you bodily 
harm must seem easy to Tim Dwight. 
</P>
<P>
	This guy has turned the NFL into his own personal X-Games. When  
Dwight returns a kick for the Atlanta Falcons, he transforms his 
puny 5-foot-8, 184-pound body into a weapon, just daring the 
opposing players to hit him if they can. 
</P>
<P>
	When they do -- and Dwight figures the shortest distance between  
two points is through someone -- he usually scrapes himself off the 
ground with a smile on his face and bounce in his step, as if to 
say: ``Pain, what a rush!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I challenge myself to see how crazy I can be,'' said Dwight,  
munching on a miniature box of Fruit Loops (``I've got to have my 
sugar,'' he explains). ``I won't go to the point of getting killed. 
Getting hurt is one thing. To get killed is another thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	OK, so this rookie prefers to live. But make no mistake: Dwight  
is going to take this thing known as life right to the edge of 
common sense. 
</P>
<P>
	``A good player has to have no fear,'' he said. ``One you get  
scared, you make mistakes. I think a lot of guys in football are 
fearless, reckless. That's how you have to be, but with a little 
stability -- just a little -- too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dwight, a fourth-round pick from Iowa, hardly played like a  
rookie on his way to the Super Bowl. He's unafraid to return a 
kickoff from 6 or 7 yards deep in the end zone or grab a punt over 
his shoulder at the 1 and take off the other way. By the way, he 
tried both those maneuvers in the NFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't help but like him because he goes 90 miles an  
hour,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``Unless you're a coach standing 
there and he fields a punt on the 1-yard line. That's one of those 
deals where you go, `No, Tim, no.' Then, it's `Yes, Tim, yes.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons hoped Dwight would be a breakaway player on the  
special teams, and he didn't disappoint. He averaged 27 yards on 
kickoff returns, returning one for a 93-yard touchdown, and 8.5 
yards on punt returns, with the constant threat of going all the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people back there take a little different style than  
me,'' he said. ``I'm more aggressive than some folks are. That's 
the way I approach the game, try to take my tone to them and see 
how they're going to react.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver punter Tom Rouen knows what he's up against in Sunday's  
Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know he's not going to fair catch. He's just a fearless  
guy,'' Rouen said. ``You've got to make sure you get the ball up in 
the air and make sure there's a lot of guys around him when he 
catches it. If you give him too much free room to run, he can hurt 
you bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dwight's value doesn't stop at the special teams. He's the  
Falcons' third receiver and also lines up in the backfield at 
times, where he can run (eight carries, 19 yards) or pass (1-for-2, 
22 yards). 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very versatile and he's a really exciting player to  
watch,'' Reeves said. ``We thought he would help us light up the 
Georgia Dome. I kind of think he's done that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With his blonde hair cropped in a crew cut, Dwight always seems  
to be on his way to somewhere else. He's like a small child trying 
to escape from a parent, his eyes darting from side to side in 
constant search of a new challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	He raced motorcycles on the interstate. He leaped into  
snowdrifts from a balcony. He dove into the icy water of the 
Wisconsin River from an 85-foot ledge known as High Rock. He plans 
to go snowboarding after the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	In the future, he'd like to try skydiving. And bungee jumping.  
And whitewater rafting. 
</P>
<P>
	He plans to return to Iowa this spring to complete his degree in  
sports management. While he's there, he figures he might as well 
get in his final year of track and field eligibility. He'll compete 
in the 100 and 200 meters, as well as the relays. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what life is all about, having a great time,  
experiencing things,'' he said. ``You've got to give it 100 
percent. That's what I've tried to do with everything since I was a 
kid. Now I'm doing it as a grown-up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, I hate that word.''

<HEADLINE> China Will Not Devalue Its Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Not only will China not devalue its currency, but  
a devaluation would be harmful and is unnecessary, the central bank 
governor said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Devaluation has no advantages,'' said Dai Xianglong, head of  
the People's Bank of China. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would harm the interests of foreign investors. Secondly, it  
would increase the foreign debt of China. Thirdly, it would not 
benefit the stability of Asian financial markets,'' he told a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Dai's reassurances came as little surprise: Chinese leaders,  
including Premier Zhu Rongji, have repeatedly pledged that the yuan 
will remain stable through this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But fears that the government might break its pledges resurfaced  
after Brazil devalued its currency this month, sending shivers 
through Asian financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel pleased that the yuan has so much influence,'' Dai  
said, noting the financial markets' anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
	But even at the height of the Asian financial crisis, when other  
currencies in the region were plunging in value, the yuan, also 
known as the RMB, held firm, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, there's even less of a need to devalue,'' Dai said. ``As  
the person in charge I reassure you that the RMB will not devalue. 
I think these are official and authoritative views.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In listing reasons why a devaluation was not on the cards, Dai  
said China's foreign exchange reserves of $145 billion exceed its 
annual import costs. Export costs also are stable, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The RMB will only devalue when there is a great imbalance in  
the balance of payments of China and there is a great increase in 
the cost of exports,'' Dai said. ``But I do not think these 
conditions exist this year.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Admits Iraq Missile Mistake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. military officials say they regret that a  
number of civilians were killed and injured in an American missile 
attack in southern Iraq, but they say the blame lies with President 
Saddam Hussein for threatening U.S. pilots patrolling Iraqi skies. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Anthony Zinni, commander of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf  
area, said Monday the American military will continue to hit Iraqi 
air defense radars, missiles and communications facilities in 
response to what he called increasingly hostile actions by Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Today the Pentagon reported two Iraqi violations of the  
``no-fly'' zone in northern Iraq and said a Marine Corps EA-6B 
Prowler, an electronic warfare plane, fired a high-speed 
anti-radiation missile after being targeted with radar at an Iraqi 
air defense site near the city of Mosul. Results of the Prowler 
attack, which occurred about 6 a.m. EST, were unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, F-15E strike aircraft fired guided bombs and an  
AGM-130 missile at anti-aircraft artillery emplacements and 
surface-to-air missile sites in southern Iraq, the Pentagon said. 
Other details were not immediately available, spokesman Col. 
Richard Bridges said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bridges said there were no reports of additional confrontations  
in southern Iraq today. 
</P>
<P>
	In Baghdad, Saddam urged Iraqis to be patient in the battle  
against the United States, saying in a speech carried by the 
official Iraqi News Agency: ``Your blood will not go in vain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zinni said Iraq tripled the number of surface-to-air missile, or  
SAM, batteries in the southern ``no-fly'' zone patrolled by U.S. 
and British warplanes in recent weeks. He said Iraqi fighter 
aircraft are trying to draw allied pilots into ``SAM-bushes'' in 
hopes of shooting one down. 
</P>
<P>
	Zinni said he could not yet confirm that the extensive damage  
and casualties to residential areas in and around the southern port 
city of Basra was caused by errant U.S. missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We deeply regret any civilian casualties regardless of what  
the cause may be,'' he said. ``But these exchanges have been 
initiated by Saddam Hussein.'' He said the United States wanted its 
Arab allies in the region to understand that U.S. missile attacks 
do not target civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one can guarantee that these strikes will not have errors  
or we might not have errant ordnance, but we do take every possible 
attempt to ensure that that doesn't happen,'' Zinni said. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-star Marine Corps general said it was premature to  
consider apologizing for the civilian losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Zinni said air crews that returned from Monday's mission over  
southern Iraq were interviewed as part of a painstaking effort to 
pinpoint what happened in the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the course of these debriefings review we have the  
possibility of one missile that may have been errant,'' but more 
study is needed to confirm the outcome, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Iraq, Basra governor Ahmed Ibrahim Hamash said two American  
aircraft fired five missiles that killed 11 people and injured 59. 
</P>
<P>
	The speculation centered on the AGM-130, a newly modified,  
rocket-powered missile launched by Air Force F-15E strike planes. 
The missile carries 2,000 pounds of explosives and is equipped with 
a guidance system that enables the crew of the launching aircraft 
to watch the missile's path on a television monitor and steer it to 
its target. 
</P>
<P>
	Zinni confirmed that AGM-130s were among the weapons fired in  
Monday's attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The official Iraqi News Agency said one American missile hit the  
al-Jumhuriya neighborhood of Basra, a southern port city, at 9:30 
a.m. (2:30 a.m. EST). Others hit 40 minutes later in the nearby 
village of Abu al-Khaseeb, as well as the Basra airport and an oil 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials said the American planes targeted an Iraqi SA-3  
surface-to-air missile battery north of Basra and ``associated 
integrated air defense systems.'' One official, speaking on 
condition of anonymity, said the associated targets were 
intelligence and communications links. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident near Basra was one of several confrontations in the  
skies over Iraq on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hours after the attack in southern Iraq, U.S. planes  
reported coming under fire by Iraqi surface-to-air missiles near 
the northern city of Mosul. They responded by firing laser-guided 
bombs and anti-radar missiles at the air defense sites. There was 
no word on damage on the ground, but Air Force officials said none 
of the U.S. planes was damaged in the attacks.

<HEADLINE> Baltimore Police Will Reorganize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Baltimore police are giving neighborhood  
commanders more authority in an effort to reduce crime and the 
city's homicide rate, which is more than four times that of New 
York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore, the nation's 14th-largest city with 650,000  
residents, has had in excess of 300 murders a year for the past 
decade; it has about 46 deaths per 100,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	To bring that rate down, homicide detectives will focus on  
specific areas of the city and work closely with district 
lieutenants, who will have greater responsibility and authority in 
dealing with crime in their precincts. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the reorganization that begins Feb. 1, the city's 60  
homicide detectives will begin working with detectives who 
investigate non-fatal shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always recognized that a shooting is an unsuccessful  
homicide,'' said Col. John Gavrilis, commander of the Criminal 
Investigations Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	Both groups of detectives will be supervised by a high-level  
commander, who will also supervise efforts to combat youth crime. 
</P>
<P>
	What has frustrated police, city politicians and residents is  
that, aside from the high number of homicides, violent crime is 
down more than 30 percent over the past 2 1/2 years. Property crime 
also has decreased substantially. 
</P>
<P>
	Some city residents are optimistic about the changes.  
</P>
<P>
	Cleoda Walker, public safety chairwoman for a Cherry Hill  
neighborhood group, said the plan will help efforts to make her 
community safer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Crime prevention is everybody's business,'' Ms. Walker said.  
``This plan sets up togetherness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Jesse Oden, who works in Cherry Hill, said the new plan is  
good, even if it means more work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before, if anything happened, the first thing a lieutenant  
said was, `It didn't happen on my shift,''' he said. ``Now whatever 
happens, it's yours.''

<HEADLINE> Ore. Mom Sentenced in Death of Son </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELLEFONTAINE, Ohio (AP) -- A woman who said she slept through  
her toddler's screams when he was stuck in a heating duct was 
sentenced to a year and a half in prison for child endangerment. 
</P>
<P>
	DeAnna McGee, 25, was sentenced Monday after pleading guilty  
last week to child endangering in the death of her 20-month-old 
son, Chad. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 24, 1994, while his mother was sleeping, Chad removed a  
floor grating, crawled into a foot-wide duct and became stuck. He 
died of dehydration from burns. 
</P>
<P>
	Appeals courts overturned two previous child endangering  
convictions, but Ms. McGee decided last week to avoid another trial 
and agreed to the plea. 
</P>
<P>
	During a 1994 trial, prosecutor Gerald Heaton said a neighbor  
heard the boy's yells. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Marc Triplett said he will ask for his client's  
early release after she serves 30 days on grounds that the loss of 
her son has caused her enough suffering.

 *Things Heard Around the Watercooler    	
</P>
<P>
	V-8s CLIMB TO THE TOP: It appears that the old line bigger is  
better really does apply when it comes to car and light truck 
engines. Ward's Auto World put together its list of top 10 engines 
in vehicles selling for $50,000 or less in the United States, and 
four V-8s made it, the most since Ward's began judging engines in 
1995. The trade magazine said it doesn't know if this means its 
staff, like the car-buying public, is leaning more toward big, 
powerful vehicles. But the fact that no four-cylinder engines made 
the 1999 list does indicate that horsepower can make a motorist's 
heart go as fast as his or her engine. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	BAD CREDIT, BIG PREMIUM: It's well-known that a car owner's  
address, age and driving record are all factors that go into 
determining an insurance premium on his or her car insurance, but 
according to SmartMoney magazine, many people don't realize their 
credit rating also plays a part. The magazine says a business 
failure or even a mistake in a credit report could drive premiums 
higher. Part of the reason is, if you're having financial problems, 
the insurance industry figures you're more likely to need money and 
file a claim. Twelve states do limit the use of credit histories in 
determining premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	THE RULES OF OFFICE ROMANCE: Although many companies frown on  
employees dating one another, many people have still met their true 
love at the office. Michael Karpeles, an attorney specializing in 
employment law, suggests companies not try to prohibit dating or 
relationships among co-workers, since that would be unrealistic. 
What bosses can do is to set some guidelines to ensure that 
sweethearts remain professional. For example, Karpeles says, there 
should be written policies that promote uniform treatment of all 
workers at all levels of the company, and they should apply to 
married as well as unmarried couples. The policies should require 
that couples report their relationship if they work together. 
Relationships between a supervisor and subordinate should remain 
off limits. And couples should not be allowed to make public 
displays of affection or spend too much time talking to one 
another. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	HIGH-TECH HELP WANTED: The strong market for executives should  
remain health throughout the first half of this year, according to 
Management Recruiters International, an employment search firm. The 
company surveyed 3,800 managers across the country and found nearly 
53 percent plan to increase their staffs between now and July. The 
biggest demand for help is expected in the information technology 
and telecommunications businesses, following by printing, 
pharmaceuticals and retailers. The lowest demand is expected in raw 
materials industries, such as metals, lumber, textiles and 
chemicals.

<HEADLINE> Case Corp Has $194M Quarterly Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RACINE, Wis. (AP) -- Case Corp., a big manufacturer of farm and  
construction equipment, lost $194 million in the fourth quarter 
amid declining demand for its products and hefty costs to cover job 
cuts and plant closings. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss for the October-December quarter equaled $2.70 per  
share and reversed a profit of $123 million, or $1.56 per share, in 
the same period last year, Case reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue dropped 14 percent to $1.50 billion from $1.75 billion,  
reflecting a sharp drop in farm equipment sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarterly loss included $96 million in restructuring costs  
and the effects of unfavorable exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Case said it expects 1999 earnings to be reduced by $30 million  
to $40 million to cover 800 previously announced job cuts by the 
end of the year, which would bring the company's total number of 
job cuts to 3,400. Case has also announced plans to shut down 
factories in Hugo, Minn., and Hamilton, Ontario, by the end of this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are entering 1999 confident that we have taken steps to  
maximize our performance under current conditions, and we are in an 
excellent position to show rapid improvement when the market 
rebounds,'' said Jean-Pierre Rosso, Case chairman and chief 
executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, Case earned $64 million, or 75 cents per share,  
down from $403 million, or $5.11 per share, in 1997. Revenue rose 
to $6.15 billion from $6.02 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Case shares fell 31 1/4 cents to close at $20.62 1/2 on the New York  
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> McCain Introduces Boxers' Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain, a boxing fan, has introduced  
legislation aimed at protecting fighters from exploitation and 
requiring more openness from promoters about their financial 
dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must prevent boxers from being cheated'' and the public  
from being denied ``the benefits of a truly honest and legitimate 
sport,'' said McCain, R-Ariz., who submitted the bill late Monday 
with Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, named for Muhammad Ali, would restrict coercive option  
contracts by which promoters control a boxers' career, such as 
contracts forcing a boxer into a long-term deal in exchange for a 
shot at a world title. 
</P>
<P>
	It would require promoters and organizers of major boxing events  
to disclose more financial information and to inform state boxing 
commissions of charges, costs and fees they take out of a boxer's 
purse. 
</P>
<P>
	Identical legislation passed the Senate last October by voice  
vote, but the House did not take up the measure before the session 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
	In hearings last July, both World Boxing Council president Jose  
Sulaiman and International Boxing Federation counsel Walter Stone 
endorsed the bill, although Sulaiman voiced opposition to 
provisions that would change the rating practices of boxing bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain and Bryan in 1996 authored legislation to strengthen  
health and safety measures followed by state boxing commissions. 
That legislation became law.

<HEADLINE> Banana Debate in WTO Stalls Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- For a second straight day, two tiny Caribbean  
nations blocked a debate Tuesday in the World Trade Organization 
over an escalating banana dispute between the United States and the 
European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has requested approval of $520 million in  
sanctions on EU imports, saying the EU's policy on bananas violates 
global trading rules by favoring producers in former European 
colonies at the expense of cheaper Latin American varieties 
distributed by U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Lucia and Dominica, which both side with the EU, again used  
a procedural maneuver to hold up a meeting of the WTO's dispute 
settlement body. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting adjourned until Thursday amid hopes that the United  
States and the 15-nation EU would accept a compromise from WTO 
Director-General Renato Ruggiero. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. trade ambassador Rita Hayes said Washington would press  
ahead with its plan to slap 100 percent tariffs against European 
products by March 3 if the EU failed to reform its banana trading 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to stick to our timetable,'' said Hayes. ``We're  
not going to give up our rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The EU rejects the U.S. accusations, saying its new banana  
import policy addresses any trade objections. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Caribbean countries' stalling technique led to concerns  
that other nations could use the same technique if they feared the 
outcome of a meeting. This would bring the 133-nation WTO grinding 
to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think bananas is worth that,'' said Ruggiero.  
</P>
<P>
	In a separate meeting, nations failed to make headway in  
choosing a successor for Ruggiero, whose term expires in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi has the most  
support so far, followed by Moroccan trade ambassador Hassan 
Abouyoub. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 158 disputes have been referred to the WTO since it  
was founded four years ago to police global trade and open markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In 20 cases, WTO panels have ordered members to change national  
laws in the interests of fair trade. Most of the other disputes are 
still being considered. 
</P>
<P>
	A WTO panel is studying whether the EU has fulfilled its  
obligations with its new rules of banana trading, but is unlikely 
to report before April 12.

<HEADLINE>  Colombia Quake Toll Passes 700 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARMENIA, Colombia (AP) -- The confirmed death toll from one of  
the worst earthquakes to hit Colombia in more than a century 
reached 700 on Tuesday as survivors anxiously awaited relief 
supplies and prayed for signs of life under the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	Those hopes were dashed again and again, and officials feared  
that the final death count would exceed 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's 6-magnitude earthquake devastated cities and villages  
across western Colombia, a vast Andean terrain where much of the 
world's coffee is grown. The temblor shook buildings as far away as 
the capital, Bogota, 140 miles from the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
	Two small aftershocks hit Armenia on Tuesday afternoon, causing  
little damage but sending panicked residents running into the 
rubble-littered streets. There have been about 15 aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
	With many people believed still buried beneath the rubble,  
mayhem reigned Tuesday in the streets of Armenia, a city of 
300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescue teams had recovered about 700 bodies in the country  
Tuesday, and estimated that at least 3,000 were injured -- but 
warned this was only a partial accounting. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Ciro Antonio Guiza, Armenia's deputy fire chief, said  
rescue workers were so strapped that many bodies remained on the 
streets uncollected. ``There are more than 1,000 dead, perhaps more 
than 2,000 in Armenia alone,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Giraldo, the Colombian Red Cross official in charge of  
his organization's relief effort, also put the death toll at 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds of Armenia's buildings were rendered uninhabitable.  
People wandered about desperately looking for relatives. There was 
no electricity or running water in most of the city, and food was 
in dangerously short supply. An estimated 180,000 people were left 
homeless in Armenia alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffins have become a coveted commodity.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've been looking for five coffins for relatives since 8  
o'clock this morning and I couldn't find any, so we're going to 
have to bury them in plastic,'' said 34-year-old Diego Ruiz, who 
lost his grandmother, a sister and three nieces. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescue workers scrambled to evacuate the thousands of injured  
and to locate survivors. At the city's small airport, ambulances 
arrived every 15 minutes with more victims, who were airlifted to 
hospitals in Bogota, Medellin and Cali. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a danger of epidemics, because we have more than 200  
bodies and we have no refrigerated trucks,'' said Giraldo of the 
Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
	Two members of Colombia's professional soccer club Atletico  
Quindio -- Diego Montenegro and Ruben Biurret, both from Argentina -- 
were found dead. Witnesses said the two were holding onto each 
other in the ruins of a downtown hotel. Another four players are 
feared dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say they need help, tons of it: tents, food,  
forklifts, backhoes, antibiotics, generators -- and body bags. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombians, eager to help, formed long lines at blood banks. The  
government set up a bank account to receive donations, and more 
than $640,000 had been deposited. 
</P>
<P>
	What was needed, though, was more -- maybe hundreds of millions  
of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to need a great deal of international aid because  
the government by itself does not have enough resources,'' said 
Piedad Correal Rubiano, the ombudsman of Quindio state, whose 
capital is Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams of earthquake specialists from the United States,  
including 64 from Florida's Dade County, and Japan traveled to 
Colombia to aid the search for survivors. Mexico said Tuesday it 
would send a 105-man army search team with sniffer dogs and power 
generators. 
</P>
<P>
	First lady Nohra Pastrana went on national television to promise  
Colombians that relief was on the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are sending tents, food, help for the children. ...  
International groups are coming, too, to help us remove the 
rubble,'' she told the RCN network. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, President Andres Pastrana, declared western  
Colombia a disaster area Tuesday and surveyed the devastation. He 
canceled plans to visit Munich, Germany, to meet with World Bank 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	In a nationally televised speech Tuesday night, Pastrana  
promised $12.6 million dollars to rebuild homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the moment in which all Colombia will pay back those  
who for years and with their own hands have collected the coffee 
beans and generated for us peace, progress, and work,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton telephoned the Colombian president Tuesday to  
express sympathy and condolences. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the massive effort, Colombia's rescue operation appeared  
to be strained beyond its capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	Correal spoke of chaos in much of the affected region. She said  
inmates had set fire to Armenia's San Bernardo prison, which was 
still burning Tuesday, and would not allow firefighters in. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the 700 inmates in the Pena Blanca jail in nearby  
Calarca were also staging an uprising, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Few buildings were left standing in Calarca, a town just south  
of Armenia. Workers recovered 106 bodies there by midday. Rubble 
was strewn down one of side of the main avenue, and the silver bell 
tower of the San Jose church was teetering at a precarious angle. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional 38 bodies were recovered in Pereira, the region's  
largest city. The village of Circasia was wiped out, with an 
undetermined number of casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia's endemic poverty made the disaster even worse.  
Buildings made of decaying cement and cinderblock were no match for 
the might of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the northern section of Armenia, where the wealthy live,  
was left largely intact. Here, authorities set up headquarters for 
the relief effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in the town, bodies were strewn about amid the rubble.  
People cried and prayed, hoping that a loved one would be found 
alive beneath a fallen wall or beam. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Cross workers had one small success Tuesday, excavating  
three men who were trapped on the first floor of a four-story 
building for more than 13 hours. A crowd in downtown Armenia 
applauded their effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were having coffee and saved themselves by ducking  
between a large safe in a pawn shop and the wall just before the 
floors above came crashing down on them. 
</P>
<P>
	At least nine firefighters were killed when Armenia's  
three-story fire station fell in on itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Two dozen officers were also feared killed in the collapse of a  
police barracks. One of the officers was rescued alive Tuesday, as 
were four other people in another part of the Armenia, said city 
police officer Mario Delgado. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's quake was the deadliest in Colombia since 1875, when  
about 1,000 people died in a tremor near Cucuta, a border city with 
Venezuela.

	President Clinton telephoned the Colombian president Tuesday to  
express sympathy and condolences. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the massive effort, Colombia's rescue operation appeared  
to be strained beyond its capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	Correal spoke of chaos in much of the affected region. She said  
inmates had set fire to Armenia's San Bernardo prison, which was 
still burning Tuesday, and would not allow firefighters in. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the 700 inmates in the Pena Blanca jail in nearby  
Calarca were also staging an uprising, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Few buildings were left standing in Calarca, a town just south  
of Armenia. Workers recovered 106 bodies there by midday. Rubble 
was strewn down one of side of the main avenue, and the silver bell 
tower of the San Jose church was teetering at a precarious angle. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional 38 bodies were recovered in Pereira, the region's  
largest city. The village of Circasia was wiped out, with an 
undetermined number of casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia's endemic poverty made the disaster even worse.  
Buildings made of decaying cement and cinderblock were no match for 
the might of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the northern section of Armenia, where the wealthy live,  
was left largely intact. Here, authorities set up headquarters for 
the relief effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in the town, bodies were strewn about amid the rubble.  
People cried and prayed, hoping that a loved one would be found 
alive beneath a fallen wall or beam. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Cross workers had one small success Tuesday, excavating  
three men who were trapped on the first floor of a four-story 
building for more than 13 hours. A crowd in downtown Armenia 
applauded their effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were having coffee and saved themselves by ducking  
between a large safe in a pawn shop and the wall just before the 
floors above came crashing down on them. 
</P>
<P>
	At least nine firefighters were killed when Armenia's  
three-story fire station fell in on itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Two dozen officers were also feared killed in the collapse of a  
police barracks. One of the officers was rescued alive Tuesday, as 
were four other people in another part of the Armenia, said city 
police officer Mario Delgado. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's quake was the deadliest in Colombia since 1875, when  
about 1,000 people died in a tremor near Cucuta, a border city with 
Venezuela.

<HEADLINE> Investors Warned About Wild Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Whether they invest online or through a  
broker, people may lose money from delays in executing trades when 
the Nasdaq Stock Market is swinging wildly and overburdened, warns 
the brokers' group operating the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Some online investors may be unable to get into their accounts.  
Other people trading the old-fashioned way -- through brokers at 
full-service or discount firms -- may have trouble getting through 
to them by phone if trading volume balloons to more than the 
electronic Nasdaq market can handle, the group said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerned about the recent gyrations in Nasdaq stock prices,  
NASD Regulation, the self-policing arm of the National Association 
of Securities Dealers, also suggested that brokerage firms, too, 
warn investors of possible losses and aggravation. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq, the nation's second-largest stock exchange, has been  
whipsawed in recent weeks by roller-coaster swings in prices of 
Internet stocks -- some of them gaining or losing $50 a share daily 
in extremely heavy trading. A group of NASD officials and 
executives of Wall Street trading firms has been meeting almost 
weekly since December to discuss the situation and possible 
solutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Pasternak, president and chief executive officer of Knight  
Securities Inc., the biggest Nasdaq trading company, said Tuesday 
the group was examining possible ``structural solutions.'' He 
declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	In bulletins to its member firms and in a posting on its Web  
site for investors, NASD Regulation cited the recent ``turbulent 
market conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Recent increased volatility and (trading) volume present new  
issues for investors, regardless of the method of trading,'' the 
regulators said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Customers eager to trade Internet stocks have flooded their  
brokers with large numbers of orders (to buy or sell), leading to 
large order imbalances ... and backlogs,'' one of the bulletins to 
firms noted. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, many firms have started to use procedures designed  
to keep customers' orders flowing while also reducing the firms' 
exposure to ``extraordinary market risk,'' NASD Regulation said. 
Some Nasdaq trading firms will temporarily discontinue normal 
automatic executions of trading orders, handling them manually. 
</P>
<P>
	NASD Regulation told the firms:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Their handling of customers' orders must be ``fair, consistent  
and reasonable'' and they should tell customers when unusual 
execution procedures are being used in a volatile market. 
</P>
<P>
	-- In their advertisements or sales brochures, online trading  
firms should not exaggerate the speed and reliability of their 
services. The online firms also should inform investors about the 
risks of trading over the Internet and the possibility of delays in 
trades being executed. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulators told investors:  
</P>
<P>
	-- They should educate themselves about how securities trades are  
executed, especially during periods of volatile prices and heavy 
volume. They should also ask plenty of questions before opening an 
online account or placing the first trade. 
</P>
<P>
	State securities regulators applauded the NASD's action.  
</P>
<P>
	``NASD Regulation is right to caution brokerage firms and the  
public about volatile markets,'' said Marc Beauchamp, spokesman for 
the North American Securities Administrators Association. ``News 
coverage has glamorized online trading and portrayed Internet 
stocks as the high-tech road to riches. Main Street investors -- 
unless they have the temperament of gamblers and money they can 
afford to lose -- should probably stick to mutual funds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  
declined comment on the NASD's action. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the SEC approved Nasdaq's request to expand from five  
to 15 minutes the ``window'' in which trading firms can make price 
quotes on newly released stocks, called initial public offerings, 
before they officially begin trading.

<HEADLINE> Chalmers, Ruby Win in Giant Slalom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADONNA DI CAMPIGLIO, Italy (AP) -- Darren Chalmers of Canada  
used a speedy second run Monday to edge Stefan Kaltschuetz by 0.12 
of a second and score his first Snowboard World Cup giant slalom 
victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Chalmers was fourth after the first run, but then sped down the  
course in 1 minute, 20.36 seconds for an aggregate time of 2:45.41 
on the 50-gate layout, the season's longest for a giant slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaltschuetz, an Austrian who widened his lead in the overall  
event standings with his second place finish, was followed by 
American Jeff Archibald. 
</P>
<P>
	Archibald led after the first run but faltered in the second and  
finished with a total time of 2:45.73. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the Olympic medalists -- Canada's Ross Rebagliati,  
Italy's Thomas Prugger or Switzerland's Ueli Kestenholz -- entered 
Monday's race. 
</P>
<P>
	Through eight events, Kaltschuetz has 3,750 giant slalom points  
to 3,180 for Archibald. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic champion Karine Ruby overtook fellow Frenchwoman  
Isabelle Blanc on the second run to capture the women's race for 
her first victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Blanc was clocked in 2:55.66, and was followed by American  
Sondra Van Ert, world champion Margerita Parini of Italy, and world 
silver medalist Lidia Trettel of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory moved Parini atop the World Cup giant slalom  
standings with 4,700 points to Parini's 4,500.

<HEADLINE> Pippen Debuts for Rockets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Scottie Pippen's debut with the Houston Rockets was a success.  
The return of the NBA in Toronto was a rush. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, who played his first 11 seasons with the Chicago Bulls,  
had 15 points and 11 rebounds Tuesday night in helping the Houston 
Rockets to a 106-104 exhibition win over San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel weird at all,'' Pippen said. ``I'm fitting in  
comfortably. I feel we did a pretty good job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets gave away all 16,285 seats to the game. Not every  
seat was filled, but fans clearly were glad to have pro basketball 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was such a long layoff,'' Pippen said. ``It was hard to  
know what to expect, but I am really glad the fans supported us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Toronto, several people were hurt as thousands of fans --  
taking advantage of free admission -- tried to enter through a 
single gate at SkyDome for the Raptors' game against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The surge of fans created a mini-stampede that produced four  
smashed doors and some broken turnstiles. No serious injuries were 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just trying to get in and my head was pushed up against  
the door and it just shattered,'' said Daniel Segon, 16, of 
Toronto. ``It was too rough for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans began lining up as early as noon because of the free-ticket  
offer, part of the NBA's plan to win back fans following the 
lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	But the organized lineup became out of control when thousands of  
fans arrived later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were really caught off guard,'' said Jim Roe, director of  
event operations for Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment. ``We were 
a little overwhelmed by the number of people taking us up on our 
offer of free tickets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Mercer scored 25 points, including Boston's first 11, as the  
Celtics beat the Raptors 106-88. 
</P>
<P>
	As the regular season drew closer, two more top players were  
rewarded with rich contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Iverson signed a six-year, $70.9 million contract  
extension with the Philadelphia 76ers while Shareef Abdur-Rahim and 
the Vancouver Grizzlies agreed to a six-year, $71 million 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA is counting on the 23-year-old Iverson to be one of its  
best young stars in the post-Michael Jordan era. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to win the most championships,'' Iverson said. ``And I  
want to be the best player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agent David Falk said Iverson wanted to stay in Philadelphia all  
along, but he got a final push from his mother and former 
Georgetown coach John Thompson to stay with the Sixers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took their best player and they didn't get into the game  
of a negotiation,'' Falk said. ``Allen reciprocated and said, 
`Thanks. I want to be here, and enough's enough.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson's chance to strike it super-rich with a $100 million  
contract -- like those signed by Kevin Garnett and Shawn Kemp -- was 
wiped out by the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdur-Rahim has one year left on his three-year deal and would  
have had the opportunity to become a free agent at the end of this 
season. The official announcement on his deal was to come today. 
</P>
<P>
	A unanimous choice to the NBA rookie team in his first season,  
the forward followed that up last season by leading the Grizzlies 
with 22.3 points per game, tied with Charlotte's Glen Rice for 
sixth in the league.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Meets With Pope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire got his summit meeting with the  
pope, after all. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who was raised Catholic, met briefly with Pope John  
Paul II Tuesday night before a youth rally at the Kiel Center. The 
two shook hands just before the rally began. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he learned the pope would be here he was hoping it was  
going to work,'' St. Louis Cardinals spokesman Brian Bartow said. 
``It was on-again, off-again, then it came together rather 
quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his address, the pope referred to McGwire, who set a  
major-league record with 70 home runs last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm told there was much excitement in St. Louis during the  
recent baseball season,'' the pope said. ``Well, two great players, 
Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, were competing to break the home run 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can feel the same enthusiasm as you train for different  
goals, the goal of following Christ, the goal of bringing his 
message to the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The home run king was in town for a St. Louis Cardinals' charity  
function and a dinner honoring him as the city's Baseball Man of 
the Year Sunday and Monday. He had planned on departing for his 
home in Southern California before the pope arrived Tuesday 
afternoon, 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, McGwire left on the private jet of one of the  
Cardinals' owners soon after the meeting.

<HEADLINE> AMA Criticized for Firing Editor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The former editor of the Journal of the American  
Medical Association, fired over a sex survey published to coincide 
with President Clinton's impeachment trial, has won support from 
editors at other publications. 
</P>
<P>
	In a weekend editorial posted on the Internet, the editor of the  
prestigious British medical journal The Lancet said AMA Executive 
Vice President E. Ratcliffe Anderson Jr. should resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson ``brutally treated an internationally respected editor  
and brought the AMA to what most observers thought was impossible: 
a new and sinking low in its history,'' wrote The Lancet's editor, 
Dr. Richard Horton. 
</P>
<P>
	Current and former editors of at least seven other medical  
journals have also denounced the AMA for firing Dr. George Lundberg 
on Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson criticized Lundberg for publishing a survey in JAMA  
that showed 59 percent of college students questioned did not 
consider oral-genital contact to be sex. Anderson felt the survey 
inappropriately interjected JAMA into the debate surrounding the 
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	AMA Chairman Randolph Smoak called Horton's demand for  
Anderson's resignation ``very irresponsible'' and said the AMA 
stood by Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``They do not know the details that led to this decision,''  
Smoak said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Lundberg, who was editor of JAMA for 17 years,  
said he was ``enormously gratified by the outpouring of support.''

<HEADLINE>  Saddam Vows Revenge on U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Vowing that his people's blood ``will not  
be shed in vain,'' President Saddam Hussein threatened Tuesday to 
retaliate against the United States. American aircraft attacked 
Iraq yet again, trying to knock out more air defense sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Three U.S. warplanes fired missiles and precision-guided bombs  
near the northern city of Mosul, a day after Iraq said errant U.S. 
missiles killed 11 people and injured 59 in and around the southern 
city of Basra. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's strikes by a Marine Corps EA-6B Prowler and an F-15E  
strike aircraft patrolling the northern ``no-fly'' zone were to 
neutralize threats by Iraqi radar or anti-aircraft defenses, the 
U.S. military said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon acknowledged Tuesday that one of the U.S. missiles  
fired Monday over the no-fly zone in southern Iraq had gone astray 
and hit a neighborhood in Basra. In Washington, spokesman Kenneth 
Bacon said U.S. officials had ``no independent confirmation'' that 
it killed any Iraqis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We regret any civilian casualties,'' Bacon added.  
</P>
<P>
	National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said President Clinton  
has told the U.S. military to respond more aggressively to Iraqi 
challenges in the ``no-fly'' zones, set up to protect Iraqi rebels 
from Saddam's forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Saddam, meanwhile, stepped up his defiance.  
</P>
<P>
	``Your blood will not be shed in vain,'' he said in a speech  
Tuesday to commiserate with those affected by Monday's missile 
strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The developments further raised tensions in Iraq, already high  
since the Dec. 16-19 airstrikes by U.S. and British forces. That 
bombardment targeted military and communications sites following 
Saddam's refusal to cooperate with the U.N. commission set up to 
oversee the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the commission completes its job, the United Nations will  
not lift economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of 
Kuwait, which triggered the 1991 Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
	Saddam, in his speech, invoked the sacrifices of Basra's  
residents, who were on the front line in the Gulf War as well as 
Iraq's 1980-88 war with Iran. The speech was carried by the 
official Iraqi News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Be patient, our beloved and brothers. Victory will be with  
those who are patient,'' Saddam urged the 1 million people of 
Basra, a city 340 miles southeast of Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your blood will blossom ... in the tree of freedom, resistance  
and victory,'' Saddam said. He did not specify what action he might 
take in response to the Basra attack. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the U.S. missiles fell Monday on Basra's working-class  
neighborhood of al-Jumhuriya, where officials said five people were 
killed and 42 were injured. Another missile hit the village of Abu 
Falous outside Basra, where six people reportedly died and 17 were 
injured. Three other missiles fell around Basra but caused no 
casualties, Iraqi officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of Al-Falous were in mourning Tuesday. The sounds of  
prayer from a mosque filled the air. Women gathered in a house to 
beat their chests and wail in traditional expressions of grief. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents said the missile struck the house of Fadl Abbas  
Mansour, gouged out holes in the roof and careened into other 
homes. By the time it landed in a mud-filled street, two 
stone-walled houses had collapsed and two others were badly 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters who visited the village saw the 6-foot barrel of the  
gray missile on the street, minus its nose and tail. 
</P>
<P>
	Mansour, a 53-year-old fertilizer factory worker, showed  
reporters around his house. A bed had collapsed in one room, and in 
another a ceiling fan with its blades drooping hung from a beam. 
</P>
<P>
	Five women in Mansour's family, including two granddaughters --  
one 3 months old and the other 14 years -- suffered cuts and 
bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why shouldn't I be angry?'' he asked. ``What did I do to  
America to be punished like this?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Baghdad, Iraq's Parliament speaker accused Saudi Arabia and  
Kuwait of conspiring with the United States against Iraq. ``The 
Saudi and Kuwaiti regimes have become the head of a venomous 
snake,'' Saadoun Hummadi told Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	He said in addition to supporting the United States, the two  
countries coerced other governments into adopting anti-Iraq stances 
at an Arab League meeting last weekend.

<HEADLINE> Tainted Meat Death Toll Hits 12 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The death toll from tainted meat linked to a Sara  
Lee Corp. subsidiary's processing plant has risen to 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The outbreak of a rare strain of listeria bacteria has sickened  
at least 79 people in 17 states since August, the federal Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention reported Monday. In addition to 
the 12 deaths, three women have had miscarriages, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago-based Sara Lee recalled hot dogs and deli meats produced  
at its Bil Mar plant in Zeeland, Mich., after the CDC found 
listeria contamination in unopened packages of the products. 
</P>
<P>
	The recalled products bear identification numbers of EST P-261,  
for poultry, or 6911, for other meats. Affected brand names include 
Ball Park, Bil Mar, Sara Lee Deli Meat and Sara Lee Home Roast. 
</P>
<P>
	The states reporting listeria infections are Arizona,  
Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Oregon, 
Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Vermont and West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,800 cases of food poisoning caused by listeria are  
reported annually in the United States. Healthy people usually can 
fight off the bacterium with no more than flu-like symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest listeria outbreak occurred in California in  
1985, according to the CDC. Forty-eight people died and 66 
miscarriages were linked to contaminated cheese.

<HEADLINE> Pope To Meet Rosa Parks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Pope John Paul II will meet with civil rights  
pioneer Rosa Parks on Wednesday during the pontiff's two-day visit 
to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope and Mrs. Parks will meet privately inside the residence  
of Archbishop Justin Rigali just before an evening prayer service 
at the Cathedral Basilica, the St. Louis Archdiocese said Tuesday. 
Mrs. Parks, 85, will then participate in the service. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1955, Mrs. Parks, a black seamstress, refused to give up her  
seat to a white man on a segregated bus in Montgomery, Ala. Her 
arrest touched off a successful black boycott of Montgomery buses 
and lifted the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to national prominence. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Parks now lives in Detroit.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- So you didn't get to see the pope. You could  
cry in your Holy Smoke beer or pray on your Official Papal Rosary 
that you'll get another chance. Or you could just shop your sorrow 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	Merchandisers took full advantage of Pope John Paul II's visit  
to St. Louis, selling everything from cheap plastic crucifixes 
decorated with tiny, hand-cut pictures of the pope to Waterford 
crystal paperweights. 
</P>
<P>
	It cost just $15.50 to get a hawker's license from the city and  
sell just about anything -- flags, pennants, handkerchiefs, buttons, 
straw crucifixes, images of Mary -- to the flock. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Walter, 35, hawked T-shirts and pins licensed by the  
Archdiocese of St. Louis. ``This way, I get to see the pope and 
maybe make some money, too,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Catholic Supply of St. Louis, which supplied many of the  
souvenirs, said rosaries featuring John Paul's face were popular, 
as were keychains and commemorative coins. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Tap Room tavern, the Holy Smoke Papal Porter, brewed in  
honor of John Paul's visit, was a hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sold so well we had to take it off the taps for a couple of  
days,'' operations manager Sara Landers said. ``We were afraid it 
would sell out before he got here.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Taxpayers, corporations and individual donors  
are helping the Roman Catholic Church foot the estimated $7 million 
bill for Pope John Paul II's 30-hour visit to the city. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Regional Commerce &AMP; Growth Association has  
estimated the papal visit could pump up to $25 million into the 
local economy. The estimated 600,000 out-of-towners alone are 
expected to spend $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials insisted the $2.7 million in taxpayer funds  
being spent are limited to aspects of the visit that are not 
overtly religious and recognize the pope as a visiting head of 
state. Those include police costs, other expenses to protect the 
public, and the Lambert Field ceremonies for the pope's arrival and 
departure. 
</P>
<P>
	But public money is also paying for the orchestra at Wednesday's  
papal Mass at the Trans World Dome. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporations have contributed or pledged about $3 million, and  
individual donors have kicked in about $1 million, said Monsignor 
Ted Wojcicki of the papal visit planning committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Archdiocese is spending several hundred thousand  
dollars of its own money and is also getting financial help from 
other dioceses and Catholic groups. 
</P>
<P>
	People using shuttle buses running from venue to venue are being  
asked to make $10 donations to help defray costs. The archdiocese 
also will get a share of the profits from the sale of officially 
licensed souvenirs.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Fall As Stocks Lure Investors / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell for a second day in a row as  
rising stock prices again lured investors away from fixed-income 
investments Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 3/16  
point, or $1.88 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to 5.13 percent from 5.11 percent 
Monday and 5.07 percent on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The rising stock market once again robbed Treasury securities of  
some of their appeal as safe-haven investments. The Dow Jones 
industrial average rose 121.26 points to 9,324.58, leaving it 
within 320 points of its Jan. 8 closing record of 9,643.32. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were off between 1/32 point and 1/16 point, and intermediate 
maturities were down 1/8 point to 1/4 point, reported Bridge Telerate, 
a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 1.10 
points to 1,319.50. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.45 percent as the  
discount rose 0.04 percentage point from the auction Monday to 4.35 
percent. Six-month yields were also 4.45 percent, as the discount 
rose 0.02 percentage point to 4.30 percent. One-year yields were 
4.48 percent as the discount rose by 0.03 percentage point from 
late Monday to 4.29 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.88 percent from 5 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose to 125 3/8 from 125 3/16. The average 
yield to maturity fell to 5.12 percent from 5.13 percent.

<HEADLINE> FDA Urges Caution With Clot-Buster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration urged doctors  
to consider prescribing alternative drugs to Abbott Laboratories' 
clot-buster Abbokinase, saying it poses a potential risk of 
spreading infectious disease. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to doctors Monday, the FDA warned that Abbokinase,  
known chemically as urokinase, should ``be reserved only for those 
situations where a physician has considered the alternatives and 
has determined that the use of Abbokinase is critical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abbokinase is one of many drugs used to dissolve blood clots. It  
is made from kidney cells taken from newborns who have died. 
</P>
<P>
	FDA inspectors halted shipments of Abbokinase in November after  
uncovering ``significant deviations'' from manufacturing rules that 
ensure drugs' purity and safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA said the kidney cells were taken from foreign newborns  
who were at high risk of carrying infectious diseases, including 
hepatitis C, yet Abbott didn't adequately test for infection. Also, 
the FDA said the cells were handled in a way that could have 
allowed contamination. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA has no evidence that Abbokinase actually was  
contaminated and is letting shipments resume with Abbott's 
agreement to tighten manufacturing safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the agency used the incident to warn doctors to weigh the  
potential risk of infection inherent to Abbokinase because it is 
made from human cells. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just saying, consider the alternatives,'' said FDA's Dr.  
David Feigal. ``It is a reminder that some of the other products 
are not human-sourced, so they do have different risks.''

<HEADLINE> The Superstars Nobody Wanted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Leave it to Jamal Anderson, the NFL's most  
media-savvy superstar to put into words what Terrell Davis has 
meant to scores of NFL players who wait and wait on draft day to 
hear their names called. 
</P>
<P>
	``Terrell,'' Anderson says, ``has kind of carried the flag for  
the unwanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Unwanted'' is how the Falcons like to portray themselves.  
Their press release for the Super Bowl proudly flaunts all the 
times their players and coaches have been cut or fired. 
</P>
<P>
	And Atlanta players, revving up their us-against-the-world  
engines, are programmed to tell people that they have only two 
first-round draft choices in their starting lineups -- offensive 
tackle Bob Whitfield and linebacker Cornelius Bennett, who landed 
in Atlanta three seasons ago as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	But the real showpieces for imperfection in the NFL's draft  
process are the two running backs in Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, last season's Super Bowl MVP, this season's league MVP  
and just the fourth back in history to run for more than 2,000 
yards, was taken in the sixth round by Denver in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, whose 1,846 yards were second to Davis, was taken in  
the seventh round a year earlier by Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	How did that happen?  
</P>
<P>
	Simple.  
</P>
<P>
	A fullback and nose guard at San Diego's Lincoln High School,  
Davis first went to Long Beach State and then to Georgia. While 
there, he got caught in a passing offense, then got hurt and didn't 
have a chance to show his potential until the postseason college 
all-star games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on what he did in the Senior Bowl, we figured he'd be a  
third-round choice,'' coach Mike Shanahan says. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we thought we were pretty well fixed at running back so we  
didn't take him then. By the sixth round, everyone we liked was off 
the board. We had him ranked higher, so we said `what the heck' and 
took him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, whose father who runs a security service for boxers  
and entertainers, went to Utah, where pro scouts considered him a 
little small for a fullback and a little slow for a tailback. So he 
lasted until the seventh round, a little too early for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the fourth round, I'd hoped to be a free agent because  
then I could choose my own team, one that needed a running back,'' 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he landed in Atlanta, where running backs were an  
afterthought in a run-and-shoot offense. 
</P>
<P>
	None of that stopped Anderson.  
</P>
<P>
	In training camp his rookie year, he drew an arrow pointing  
upwards on a depth chart that listed him fifth at running back. By 
his third season he was starting. 
</P>
<P>
	When Dan Reeves arrived last season, he installed an offense  
with a featured running back, and in no time at all Anderson had 
his second straight 1,000-yard season. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' success came more quickly.  
</P>
<P>
	``I remember his first day at minicamp. His pants hung down to  
his butt and he looked a little lost,'' says Gary Kubiak, the 
Broncos' offensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	But he impressed coaches running under punts on special teams,  
and by opening day he was a starter, beating out the guys Shanahan 
already had -- Aaron Craver, Rod Bernstine and Glyn Milburn. None is 
with the Broncos now. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, meanwhile, has averaged 105.1 yards a game in his first  
four seasons -- the best in NFL history and almost a yard better 
than the 104.3 by Jim Brown, the only other player with a career 
average over 100. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson's recognition finally came this season when the  
Falcons, who had never reached an NFL championship game in their 32 
seasons, won the NFC West with a 14-2 record then beat San 
Francisco and upset Minnesota to reach the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson is still known as much for his ``Dirty Bird'' dance, an  
arm-flapping post-touchdown routine, as he is for his running. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't really invent it,'' he says, then pauses. ``Well, I  
did. But I did it in the New Orleans game, which was televised to 5 
percent of the nation, and then O.J. Santiago did it in New 
England. That went to 60 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, again illustrating his media savvy, Anderson compared his  
image to Santiago in terms of the Jacksons, one of his father's 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was kind of like Jermaine,'' Anderson said, referring to  
Santiago, the Falcons' tight end. ``I'm like Michael.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When you succeed as a seventh-round draft choice, you don't have  
to be humble.

	Dismissal of Clinton Case Debated  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans remain deeply divided over  
whether to end President Clinton's impeachment trial early as they 
turn to the issue of calling witnesses or bringing the proceedings 
to a final vote. Republican leaders, meanwhile, were considering a 
plan that would allow the Senate to find Clinton guilty of perjury 
and obstruction of justice -- but not remove him from office. he 
move, Republican officials said, was predicated on the widely held 
assumption that the 67 votes needed to convict and remove Clinton 
would never materialize. This way, Clinton would emerge from the 
trial acquitted but irrevocably tarnished -- and senators would be 
afforded cover with constituents who believe Clinton should be 
ousted.

	Pope Getting Rousing Mexico Sendoff  
</P>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Adoring Mexicans gave a rousing farewell to  
Pope John Paul II, singing, stomping and swaying in a packed soccer 
stadium in his final public appearance before heading to the United 
States. More than 110,000 in giant Azteca Stadium heard the pope 
decry a loss of values, drug trafficking, corruption and other 
evils of modern society. He heads to St. Louis Tuesday, the second 
leg of a mission to give new direction to his flock on the eve of 
the third millennium and to strengthen ties between Roman Catholics 
in North and Latin America. Upon arriving, he was scheduled to meet 
with President Clinton in an airport hangar -- a day after the 
Vatican condemned the latest U.S. bombing raids on Iraq.

	U.S. Admits Iraq Missile Mistake  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. military officials say they regret that a  
number of civilians were killed and injured in an American missile 
attack in southern Iraq, but they say the blame lies with President 
Saddam Hussein for threatening U.S. pilots patrolling Iraqi skies. 
Gen. Anthony Zinni, commander of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf 
area, said Monday the American military will continue to hit Iraqi 
air defense radars, missiles and communications facilities in 
response to what he called increasingly hostile actions by Iraq. 
Zinni said Iraq tripled the number of surface-to-air missile, or 
SAM, batteries in the southern ``no-fly'' zone patrolled by U.S. 
and British warplanes in recent weeks.

	Gap Between U.S., Russia Apparent

<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The gap between the United States and Russia on  
several key issues remains wide as Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright holds a second day of meetings with top government 
leaders. From Iraq to the Balkans, on the secret transfer of 
Russian technology to Iran, and on an emerging U.S. plan to build a 
missile defense shield, Albright and the Russians are in clear 
disagreement. A special effort is due to be made Tuesday on Kosovo, 
where the two sides begin at least with the joint goal of a 
political settlement between the Serbs and the ethnic Albanians, 
who are in conflict in the Serbian province. Albright also is 
trying to get in touch with President Boris Yeltsin, who is 
hospitalized with an ulcer.

dead and 900 others injured. The quake had a preliminary magnitude 
of 6, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Its epicenter was 
located in western Valle del Cauca state, 140 miles west of the 
capital, Bogota. The victims included at least 249 people in 
Quindio state, 15 people in Risaralda state, eight in Valle del 
Cauca state and one in Tolima state.

of what the millennium meant 1000 years ago and what it might mean 
just 300-some days from now. Joined by two scholars in religion and 
history, the Clintons asked more philosophical questions about why 
the dates have significance for much of the Western world. Calling 
himself ``a walking apostle of hope,'' Clinton said the last 
millennium showed that ``ordinary people, even a long time ago, can 
make a difference toward a good end.''

24 Texas Christian 72-62 Monday night. TCU played without Lee 
Nailon, the Western Athletic Conference's leading scorer at 22.7

<HEADLINE> St. Louis Turns Out for Pope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- This city is almost giddy preparing for Pope  
John Paul II's two-day stopover in America's heartland. 
</P>
<P>
	Banners welcoming the pontiff hang from buildings and  
drive-through hamburger spots, even funeral homes. Special papal 
greeting cloths have been made for visitors to wave along parade 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
	By late this morning, thousands of people with folding chairs,  
blankets and strollers had gathered in the city's Central West End 
along the route of the first of three scheduled parades. 
</P>
<P>
	The city for months has been preparing for the first visit by  
any pope to St. Louis, the nation's 18th largest city. Workers have 
logged long hours distributing tickets, setting up venues and 
organizing the entertainment for the visit that was to begin today. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be a fantastic trip,'' said Kim Carter of  
Knoxville, Tenn., who arrived Sunday with her husband and three 
children. ``I'm very excited to see the pope. I want to see him. I 
want to revitalize our faith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of nuns around the area -- at the request of the St.  
Louis Archdiocese -- have prayed for what organizers can't control: 
nice weather for a visit that will draw President Clinton to St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The weather will not matter to a group of Catholic youths who  
drove 12 hours from Grand Rapids, Minn. The 47 teens from St. 
Joseph's Church volunteered to direct buses at the events. In 
return, they received tickets to each of the events. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a once in a lifetime chance,'' said Wendy Kraa, 13.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a way to get closer to God,'' chimed in Laural Davern,  
14. ``We prayed with our families. We've done a lot of praying. 
It's going to be great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers expect this city of some 400,000 to be swamped by as  
many as 600,000 out-of-towners eager to snap up papal T-shirts, key 
rings, rosaries, mugs and John Paul II teddy bears. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Regional Commerce &AMP; Growth Association has  
estimated that the visit could pump up to $25 million into the 
local economy. Tourists alone were expected to spend $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope's visit could attract crowds that may even surpass the  
700,000 who welcomed Charles Lindbergh back home a few weeks after 
his record flight from New York to Paris in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope, of course, has his critics. The Catholic Women for  
Justice staged a Monday evening candlelight prayer service calling 
for full participation of women in the church. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope's 31-hour visit includes three large indoor events: a  
youth rally at the Kiel Center, a Mass involving an estimated 
100,000 people at the Trans World Dome, and a prayer service at the 
St. Louis Cathedral Basilica. 
</P>
<P>
	There are also four major outdoor events: a youth march from the  
Gateway Arch to the Kiel Center rally, and three parades. 
</P>
<P>
	Boxes of paper plates, napkins and plastic silverware sat in the  
corner at the Key West Cafe, near the six-block area dubbed the 
Papal Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurant was to open five hours early today to serve  
breakfast to an estimated 1,000 people. It will do the same 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We seat 80,'' owner Thomas Burnham said. ``It's easy for us to  
do if we can plan for it. And we've had plenty of time to get 
ready.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Says They Can Extend Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans said Tuesday they have staved off  
defections and will muster enough support to extend President 
Clinton's impeachment trial with witnesses, setting up two votes 
that Democrats said could damage the bipartisan spirit of the 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	A day of private meetings followed by the announcement that  
House managers had trimmed their witness list to three figures 
emboldened Republicans who want to see the trial end with votes on 
the impeachment articles passed by the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Warner, R-Va., for example, announced Tuesday he was  
switching from being undecided on witnesses to being ``inclined'' 
to vote for them. 
</P>
<P>
	``This trial is going the distance,'' declared Sen. Phil Gramm,  
R-Texas, who with other conservatives such as Oklahoma Sens. James 
Inhofe and Don Nickles had been pushing for the trial to continue 
to its end. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate will vote on two consecutive motions Wednesday  
afternoon. The first is on Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd's request to 
dismiss the case; the second is on the request to summon the three 
witnesses sought by the House for depositions. 
</P>
<P>
	Votes pretty much along party lines are expected on both.  
</P>
<P>
	``You could end up in a far more partisan setting not only now  
but from here on out,'' said newly elected Sen. Charles Schumer, 
D-N.Y., who took part in the House proceedings as a lame-duck 
member of the Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	But a handful of centrists from each party continued to worry  
Republican and Democratic leaders as the votes loomed. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP officials said they expected few, if any, Republican  
senators would vote for the dismissal motion. They acknowledged the 
vote on calling witnesses was slightly more uncertain because of a 
handful of undecideds, such as Richard Shelby of Alabama and 
Olympia Snowe of Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans said the chances of defections on the witness  
vote had substantially dropped after House managers announced they 
would depose only Monica Lewinsky, Clinton friend Vernon Jordan and 
White House aide Sidney Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's been a change since they came in with three;  
before that, it was an iffy thing,'' said Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota agreed. ``I think  
on the vote on dismissal and on the vote on witnesses, it sounds as 
if the lines may be drawn,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A few conservative Democrats also remained in the undecided  
column, such as freshman Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina, 
according to Democratic officials who asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
	Other tough decisions are over the horizon. Democrats oppose a  
plan being considered by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott that 
would allow senators to vote that Clinton committed perjury and 
obstruction, but allow him to remain in office, said one official 
who asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott outlined the proposal to Republicans during their private  
meeting Tuesday. Supporters say it could offer political cover to 
GOP senators who believe Clinton is guilty but that the offenses 
don't warrant his removal.

<HEADLINE> ACC Showdown Pits Devils vs. Heels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Ordinarily, they would have every reason to  
be complacent. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, the Duke Blue Devils are ranked No. 2 in the country.  
They have a winning margin of 26.3 points a game and seven straight 
double-digit victories in the Atlantic Coast Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	But this is no ordinary stretch. Duke faces three top-10 teams  
in 13 days, and next up is No. 10 North Carolina on Wednesday 
night. And nothing is ever ordinary when these schools meet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot,'' Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said. ``We knew this  
stretch would be a chance for our team to grow because we'll be 
playing such big games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils (19-1, 7-0 ACC) are coming off a 92-88 overtime  
victory against No. 9 St. John's on Sunday at Madison Square Garden 
and had only two days to get ready for the Tar Heels (17-4, 5-2). 
</P>
<P>
	Duke, riding a 14-game winning streak, will travel to N.C. State  
on Saturday for its final game in Reynolds Coliseum before playing 
host to No. 4 Maryland on Feb. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach wanted us to play the best teams, so when postseason  
came we are already acclimated to teams as talented as us,'' Duke 
captain Trajan Langdon said. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the 21st time since 1985 that Duke and North  
Carolina will play each other, with both ranked in the top 10. Last 
season there were three great games while both were among the 
nation's top four teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke has lost 10 of the last 12 in the series. Still, few would  
argue that Duke is a heavy favorite for this game at Cameron Indoor 
Stadium, where the Blue Devils have won 32 straight. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a game where we have to keep going whether we get  
blown out or whether it's a close game,'' North Carolina coach Bill 
Guthridge said. ``We have to be ready for our next game, too, 
because it's how you do in the regular season that gets you into 
the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know of any advantages that we have,'' Guthridge  
added. ``We have made good improvement these last three games, but 
in studying Duke it's really hard to find a weakness. They are 
strong inside, they are strong outside and they play good 
defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski warns of making too much of this matchup, pointing to  
last year's No. 1 vs. No. 2 showdown in Chapel Hill that Duke lost 
by 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``We learned a lot from last year when we let the hype of the  
game really get to us,'' Duke's Shane Battier said. ``We're a year 
older now and we're looking at this more as a basketball game than 
a media event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never gone into a game like this where people thought we  
were the better team,'' Langdon said. ``But in this rivalry that 
doesn't matter. Both teams are 0-0 in Duke-Carolina games this 
year. Carolina doesn't care if we're favored. They feel they're the 
better team and we're going to have to feel the same way and come 
out and try to be as intense as them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski also warns of counting on the Cameron Crazies to give  
the Blue Devils the edge. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can just be the opposite for you if you don't use it the  
right way,'' Krzyzewski said. ``How so? You can assume that wins 
the game instead of you winning the game out on the court. All I 
know is they're good and we're good and let's play.''

<HEADLINE> Plea Deal for Man Who Shot Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEBRON, Neb. (AP) -- A 76-year-old man accused of shooting his  
terminally ill wife to death in her hospital bed will plead no 
contest to manslaughter, the prosecutor said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Vernal ``Bob'' Ohlrich made the plea agreement, in which charges  
of first-degree murder and use of a weapon to commit a felony were 
dropped, Thayer County Attorney Daniel Werner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Werner said the plea bargain ``serves justice.''  
</P>
<P>
	Manslaughter is punishable by up 20 years in prison and a  
$25,000 fine. The plea agreement did not include a promise of a 
recommended sentence. Werner said Ohlrich's plea will be entered 
Feb. 8. Ohlrich has been out on bond and living with family 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	He was accused of walking into the hospital room of his  
74-year-old wife, Phyllis, on Oct. 27 and shooting her once in the 
side of the head. She had been fighting a painful battle with colon 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	According to court records, Ohlrich admitted to the shooting  
after it happened and asked to be locked up.

<HEADLINE> NBC Led Last Week's Nielsen's / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Golden Globe Awards show and the countdown  
to George Clooney's departure from ``ER'' helped NBC score a solid 
victory in the Nielsen's ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	The network had a 10.4 rating and 17 share for last week, well  
above second-place CBS's 8.8 rating and 14 share, Nielsen Media 
Research said Tuesday. They were followed by ABC, with a 6.8 and 
11, and Fox, with a 6.7 and 11. 
</P>
<P>
	``ER'' was easily the week's most-watched show, solidifying its  
lead over ``Friends'' in the competition for the season's 
top-ranked series. NBC is promoting Clooney's upcoming exit, set to 
occur during next month's ratings ``sweeps'' period. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's Golden Globes telecast had a 16.1 rating, its best ever  
and a pleasant surprise for NBC, which has been broadcasting the 
show for four years. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards show's previous record was 15.9, achieved last year  
and in 1981 on CBS. Last year's telecast was buoyed by interest in 
``Titanic,'' and NBC executives had anticipated the ratings would 
slip this year. Instead, the awards show is becoming a major stop 
on the way to the Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
	The end of ``Monday Night Football'' on ABC is setting up a  
strong battle for viewers. CBS's comedies ``Everybody Loves 
Raymond'' and ``Becker'' both scored top 10 Nielsen finishes last 
week, and so did their Fox competition, ``Ally McBeal.'' ABC's 
rating last week was well below its season average. 
</P>
<P>
	The developing networks were helped by showing entertainment  
programs during President Clinton's State of the Union address. The 
WB had a 3.6 rating and 6, UPN had a 2.1 rating and 3 share and Pax 
TV was at 0.8 and 1. All were above their season averages. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' and ABC's ``World News Tonight'' tied in  
the evening news competition with 8.6 ratings and 16 shares. The 
``CBS Evening News'' had a 7.8 rating and 15 share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. Share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Jan. 18-24, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: 
</P>
<P>
	``ER,'' NBC, 21.3; ``Friends,'' NBC, 16.8; ``Frasier,'' 16.5;  
``Golden Globe Awards,'' NBC, 16.1; ``Jesse,'' NBC, 14.4; 
``Veronica's Closet,'' NBC, 14.2; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 13.5; 
``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' CBS, 12.5; ``Becker,'' CBS, 11.2; 
``Ally McBeal,'' Fox, 11.1.

<HEADLINE> Report: 'Shoddy' Auto Parts Pushed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Many insurers push ``shoddy'' and even dangerous  
knockoff replacement parts on car owners after a crash, according 
to a study in Consumer Reports magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, in the magazine's February issue, found replacement  
bumpers that crumpled with little resistance, poorly fitting 
fenders prone to rust and hoods with faulty latches that allow them 
to open at high speeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Most insurers endorse imitation parts because they come as much  
as 65 percent cheaper. Yet customers complain about knockoff parts 
twice as often, according to a survey of 500 repair shops done for 
the auto industry by Industrial Marketing Research. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Della Rova grew concerned over replacement parts after  
the hood of his Honda Accord flew into his windshield on the 
highway near Kutztown, Pa., in 1998. A damage appraiser blamed a 
cheap imitation hood made in Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference in price can be substantial. A replacement hood  
for the Accord cost about $100, compared with about $225 for a hood 
made by Honda. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a major reason why insurers call for imitation parts 59  
percent of the time, Industrial Marketing Research said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one major insurer of 10 questioned by Consumer Reports  
required replacement parts made by the original automaker: the 
Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club of Southern 
California. The magazine said Allstate will pick up the cost for 
original parts if the customer insists. State Farm, Travelers and 
Erie require the consumer to make up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
	Insurers warn that requiring parts from original equipment  
makers could drive up the $59 billion Americans spend each year 
replacing parts damaged in the 35 million auto accidents that 
happen annually. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurance industry is not aware of widespread problems with  
replacement parts, said David Snyder, a lawyer with the American 
Insurance Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Another major trade group, the Insurance Information Institute,  
noted that consumers often get a guarantee that any faults with 
replacement parts will be fixed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most major companies, including State Farm and Allstate,  
guarantee that these generic pieces will be good for the remainder 
of the life of the car,'' III spokeswoman Loretta Worters said. 
``The less claims we pay, the better off we are financially.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly everyone agrees that an open market for replacement parts  
has helped keep prices down. Yet parts from original automakers 
remain high. The sum of the parts on a 1998 Ford Explorer is more 
than 2 1/2 times its $27,145 list price, according to the Alliance of 
American Insurers. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers Union, a nonprofit group that publishes the magazine,  
wants Congress to require the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration to require labeling that would allow authorities to 
track parts for recalls and to determine legal liability. It also 
wants states to require insurers to disclose how much they're 
saving with imitation parts.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Panthers Coach Capers Joins Jags </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Dom Capers became an employee of Tom  
Coughlin on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	With that strange twist, the debate over which coach came out  
ahead in the 1995 expansion battle between the Carolina Panthers 
and Jacksonville Jaguars was officially put to rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Capers, fired last month as coach of the Panthers, will serve as  
Coughlin's defensive coordinator with the Jaguars. He replaces Dick 
Jauron, who left after four seasons to coach the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm thrilled to join Tom's staff and to have the opportunity  
to help upgrade the Jaguars' defense,'' Capers said in a statement 
released after the two interviewed Tuesday morning. ``The Jaguars 
have shown constant improvement each season, and I look forward to 
this new challenge with great anticipation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capers is expected to make about $200,000 next season and will  
probably forfeit a chunk of the approximately $1 million he would 
have received from the Panthers had he not accepted another NFL 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	That's just one oddity in a move rife with irony.  
</P>
<P>
	Fans in the two cities and NFL observers pitted the coaches  
against each other as soon as they were hired to lead their 
expansion teams -- Coughlin in early 1994, Capers in early 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Both had reputations as tough disciplinarians with great  
football minds, but their teams approached expansion in vastly 
different ways -- Carolina going for free-agent pickups engineered 
by then-general manager Bill Polian and Jacksonville opting to 
build through the draft, with Coughlin making all the decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Success came quickly to both. Capers' Panthers won the NFC West  
title in 1996 while Coughlin's Jaguars made it to the AFC 
Championship game as a wild-card team. 
</P>
<P>
	The roads diverged from there, with Jacksonville making two more  
playoff appearances and Capers losing his job after going 7-9 and 
4-12 and losing control of his locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin put history behind him and thought of only one thing --  
hiring the best coach available. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dom Capers is an excellent football coach,'' Coughlin said.  
``He has ascended through the coaching ranks, proving his quality 
at each level. He's a great fit for the Jaguars' organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Capers, Coughlin gets the coordinator who led the Pittsburgh  
Steelers defense back to prominence from 1992-94, and one of the 
first big proponents of the zone-blitz schemes that have been in 
vogue the last few years. Before that, Capers spent six years as a 
defensive backs coach with New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	His task will be to revamp a defense that has finished 25th and  
23rd in yardage allowed the last two seasons. The Jaguars are 
expected to turn over no fewer than four members of the defense 
through free agency and the draft. A shift to the 3-4 alignment 
that Capers has always preferred is not out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Coughlin still must hire an offensive coordinator to  
replace Chris Palmer, who left for the newest expansion team, the 
Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Bears coordinator Matt Cavanaugh was in town Monday for  
interviews, but left to talk with the Baltimore Ravens.

<HEADLINE> Vols No. 1 in Women's Hoops Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	With Long Beach State no longer a national power, the Big West  
Conference doesn't get much attention in women's basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	UC Santa Barbara is trying to change that.  
</P>
<P>
	The Gauchos (13-3) returned to The Associated Press poll at No.  
25 on Monday -- 10 weeks after falling out. They've won their last 
eight games and had victories earlier in the season over 
Northwestern, Drake, Vanderbilt and Southern Cal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pleased to be back in the Top 25,'' coach Mark French  
said. ``It's great to receive national recognition, especially at 
this point in the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas and Boston College also returned to the poll after being  
ranked earlier. Tennessee, meanwhile, remained the overwhelming 
choice for No. 1 and was one of just two teams that held the same 
position as last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The other was Old Dominion, which stayed at No. 12.  
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee (17-1) received 39 of 41 first-place votes and 1,023  
points from a national media panel to lead the poll for the third 
straight week. The Lady Vols beat Old Dominion and Florida last 
week to run their winning streak to 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue (16-1), Louisiana Tech (15-2) and Georgia (18-1) held the  
next three places, with Purdue and Louisiana Tech getting one 
first-place vote apiece. All three moved up one spot after 
Connecticut (16-3) lost two of three games during the week and fell 
from second to fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut, which has four key players sidelined by injuries,  
lost at Louisiana Tech, beat Miami and lost at Boston College. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado State (20-1) jumped two places to sixth and was  
followed by Notre Dame, UCLA, Duke and Texas Tech, which fell four 
spots after losing at Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia Tech (18-0), the nation's only unbeaten Division I  
team, climbed two places to 11th. Then it was Old Dominion, 
Rutgers, North Carolina and Clemson, followed by Iowa State, Auburn 
and Tulane. Ohio State and Virginia tied for 19th. 
</P>
<P>
	The final five were Penn State, Boston College, Alabama, Kansas  
and UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 11 current Big West members, Long Beach State, Cal  
State-Fullerton and New Mexico State are the only others that have 
been ranked, and it has been awhile since they appeared. 
</P>
<P>
	Long Beach State, which made the Final Four twice in the 1980s,  
hasn't been in the poll since the 1991-92 season, Fullerton was 
last ranked in the 1991-92 season and New Mexico State was ranked 
for five weeks at the end of the 1987-88 season. 
</P>
<P>
	When Santa Barbara made the preseason poll at No. 24, it was  
just the second time the school had ever been ranked. The Gauchos 
moved up to No. 22 in the second poll, then dropped out after an 
overtime loss to Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ranking is not only great for us, but also for our  
conference,'' French said. ``We hope that we can represent the 
conference well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston College (15-3) gained its first national ranking at No.  
25 three weeks ago, moved up to 21st the following week and then 
dropped out after losing two straight. The Eagles beat Providence 
last week before knocking off UConn. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas (14-6) was missing from the Top 25 for just one week. The  
Jayhawks dropped out after a 20-point loss to Nebraska, and they 
lost at Colorado last week before handing Texas Tech its first Big 
12 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida, Nebraska and Oregon dropped out. Florida, which had  
been 21st, lost to Tennessee and LSU. Nebraska, last week's No. 23 
team, lost to Colorado, while Oregon split, losing to Arizona and 
beating Arizona State. The Ducks had been 25th.

<HEADLINE> Cher To Belt Out National Anthem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Cher plans to dress up -- completely -- to sing the  
national anthem at the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be really respectful of the song. I will be  
completely covered,'' said the 52-year-old diva, who's been known 
to show some skin during performances. ``I probably won't be 
wearing black spandex. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the biggest single honor I've ever had.''  
</P>
<P>
	Cher said Tuesday she plans to do her best belting out ``The  
Star-Spangled Banner,'' considered one of the toughest musical 
arrangements to master. 
</P>
<P>
	Like other singers, she has recorded the song with an 80-piece  
orchestra at the request of game officials. She's not sure whether 
she will sing it live or lip sync. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my first time. It's a difficult song to sing,'' said  
Cher, who won an Oscar for her performance in ``Moonstruck.'' ``I 
worked with my teachers a lot on this. I wanted to learn it to 
interpret it in my own way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After singing at Sunday's game, Cher will hop a flight to the  
West Coast to begin work on a video at 6 a.m. Monday morning, 
leaving little time to party at trendy South Beach nightclubs.

<HEADLINE> Senate Debates Calling Witnesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the Senate prepared to debate whether to  
call witnesses in the impeachment trial of President Clinton, a 
Republican senator said today the case is not airtight ``and there 
are not 67 votes to convict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If it were an airtight case ... you'd probably have about 70,  
75 senators lining up to convict,'' said Sen. Richard Shelby of 
Alabama. ``You don't see that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shelby said on NBC's ``Today'' that he is willing to listen to  
House prosecutors' arguments for witnesses even though they ``are 
hoping to find something rather than perhaps having something.'' 
But unless it can be shown that witnesses will change the dynamic 
of the trial, ``I say let's dispense with the witnesses and go on 
and vote the issue up or down after we have arguments,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the prosecutors, Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., said he and  
his colleagues are sharply limiting the number of witnesses they 
want to call and believe a few witnesses would be helpful. The 
chief witness, former White House employee Monica Lewinsky ``could 
offer a limited amount of new information,'' Hutchinson said on 
NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders are considering another option: Find that  
Clinton committed perjury and obstruction of justice in connection 
with his affair with Ms. Lewinsky but not remove him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	That option by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, Republican officials  
said, is predicated on the widely held assumption that the 67 votes 
needed to convict and remove Clinton would never materialize. This 
way, Clinton would emerge from the trial formally acquitted of the 
impeachment charges but irrevocably tarnished -- and senators would 
be afforded some cover with constituents who believe action should 
be taken. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an idea that is not meeting a great deal of opposition in  
the Republican caucus,'' Lott spokesman John Czwartacki told 
reporters Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., said today, ``It raises questions in  
my mind, constitutional questions and procedural questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, said, ``My first  
reaction is that it is worth pursuing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two Republicans commented as they were arriving for a  
private meeting of the party's senators at which they hoped to 
learn more about the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats questioned whether the proposal was constitutional.  
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors were pressing their case for new testimony  
with a shortened list of witnesses today, saying the Senate 
shouldn't be forced into a quick exit strategy by polls showing the 
majority of the public continues to believe Clinton shouldn't be 
kicked out of office. 
</P>
<P>
	``A trial is a search for the truth and it should not be trumped  
by an exit strategy,'' Hyde told the Senate Monday during final 
arguments on a motion by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., to dismiss the 
case without a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans were expected to produce a formal proposal for  
witnesses today, to be voted on after the Democratic attempt to 
dismiss the charges. Votes are expected by Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Before senators went into a rare closed session Monday to debate  
Byrd's motion, the White House argued that the case was over. 
</P>
<P>
	``The case cannot be made. It is time to end it,'' said attorney  
Nicole Seligman, one of Clinton's defense team. 
</P>
<P>
	But several GOP senators were sticking to their belief that the  
president should be removed. They insisted that witnesses be called 
to substantiate charges of perjury and obstruction of justice in 
his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us are weary of this thing,'' said Sen. Don Nickles,  
R-Okla, who wants to see witnesses called to address discrepancies 
in testimony. ``All of us would like to see it terminate before too 
long, but we want to do it correctly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several of their GOP colleagues want Republican leaders to find  
a strategy that would resolve the case as early as this week, 
rather than call witnesses, according to two officials speaking 
only on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	To steady the wavering Republican support, House prosecutors  
trimmed their witness list Monday to three people: Ms. Lewinsky, 
presidential secretary Betty Currie and a third person yet to be 
determined, according to a knowledgeable Republican who demanded 
anonymity. This official said the third person was likely to be 
Vernon Jordan, White House chief of staff John Podesta or Clinton 
confidant Bruce Lindsey. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments Monday:  
</P>
<P>
	--The White House, confident of Clinton's ability to win  
acquittal, announced it would ignore a written list of questions 
submitted by Lott and other Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	--An attempt by two Democrats to open the debate to the public  
was rejected, 57-43. A two-thirds majority was needed to pass. 
</P>
<P>
	--Democrats expressed confidence they could produce enough votes  
to make it clear that Clinton will be acquitted on the impeachment 
charges. It takes a majority vote to dismiss the charges, but 
two-thirds to convict the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators in both parties have begun to call in increasing  
numbers for an end to the trial, which has consumed virtually all 
the Senate's time since it convened Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic support for Clinton has hardened over that period,  
virtually assuring his acquittal when the final vote is called.

<HEADLINE> German Coalition Makes Tax Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Germany's ruling coalition agreed Tuesday  
that no industries should be exempt from higher taxes on 
electricity under the government's tax reform plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The government of Social Democrats and environmentalist Greens  
had been forced to revise an earlier plan to exempt 
energy-intensive sectors after the European Union raised concerns 
that it was unfair. 
</P>
<P>
	The new proposal lowers the proposed electricity tax increase  
for all industries by 20 percent and sets up a complicated formula 
for rebates to high-energy industries, said a senior Social 
Democratic lawmaker, Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher energy taxes, pushed by the Greens, are intended to  
promote conservation and finance a cut in heavy contributions by 
employers and employees to the national pension system. 
</P>
<P>
	Pending approval from parliament, the increases should take  
effect April 1. The plan, dubbed ``ecological tax reform,'' also 
includes a modest increase in gasoline prices.

<HEADLINE> What Perks Nagano Offered IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- IOC members visiting Nagano received free rides on  
police helicopters during the city's winning bid for the 1998 
Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagano police official Minoru Kono told The Associated Press on  
Tuesday the rides were offered at the request of Nagano Prefecture 
(state), although he would not say how many rides were given. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, Nagano officials have disclosed how some IOC  
officials were wooed during the city's bid, including 
all-expenses-paid trips to Kyoto, a tourist spot 150 miles from 
Nagano. 
</P>
<P>
	Some IOC officials were also entertained by geisha, and IOC  
President Juan Antonio Samaranch received an expensive painting and 
Japanese sword. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese Olympic Committee executive board member Chiharu Igaya  
defended the lavish entertainment as ``normal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We talk about excessive entertainment, but the question is  
excessive compared to what?'' Igaya, who is also an IOC executive 
board member, said Tuesday. ``What was offered was definitely not 
excessive. It was normal. In business, entertainment is far more 
extravagant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Nagano Mayor Tasuku Tsukada, one of the top officials  
of the bidding committee, acknowledged ``excesses'' in his city's 
1989-1991 bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagano bid officials have said they spent about $18,000 on each  
of the 62 visiting IOC officials, including air fare as well as 
fancy wining and dining. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, a group of Nagano residents filed a civil lawsuit  
demanding that the state and city of Nagano, as well as two other 
Nagano towns that were the sites for the 1998 Games, return some $7 
million in taxpayer money that allegedly went toward the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is obvious that the money was used unlawfully,'' Kaoru  
Iwata, the group's leader, said by telephone from Nagano. ``The 
presents, the geishas, the first-class airfare -- we want all that 
money back. It's an embarrassment for Nagano.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nagano Gov. Goro Yoshimura declined comment, saying he had not  
seen the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese Olympic Committee said it is preparing to set up a  
panel to investigate Nagano's bid, as soon as it receives an 
inquiry from the IOC. The IOC has said it will investigate the bid 
of recent host cities, going back to the 1996 Atlanta Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Igaya, a silver medalist in the slalom in the 1956 Winter  
Olympics, was not sure whether the investigation would show 
Nagano's bid was clean. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no idea. I know there is a rumor, but now the JOC is  
going to investigate,'' he said. ``So until they come up with their 
report, I can't say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that Nagano's bidding expense records are missing also  
could be a problem, Igaya said, because the papers could have 
provided an ``opportunity to prove that everything was clean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A bid official said recently he had the books burned in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls, Japan Stocks Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar fell against the yen Tuesday after  
a top Chinese official denied the yuan would be devalued. Japanese 
stocks edged higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 113.56 yen at late afternoon, down 0.78 yen  
from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 
113.96 yen overnight. The dollar ranged from 113.30 yen to 113.93 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Following an overnight slip in New York, the dollar weakened  
slightly in Tokyo but stayed in a narrow range. Traders continued 
to avoid taking new positions amid uncertainty about the economic 
situation in Brazil, South America's largest economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 173.20 points,  
or 1.22 percent, ending the day at 14,382.01 points. On Monday, the 
average closed up 54.41 points, or 0.38 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar, which had strengthened Friday and early Monday in  
part because of rumors of an impending Chinese devaluation, fell 
back after Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji announced the yuan would 
remain stable in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Market players shrugged off other news Tuesay, including the  
downgrades by Moody's Investors Service of the long-term deposit 
ratings at several big Japanese banks, as old news, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've gotten into the phase now where all the market-moving  
news has been factored in and we have to wait for the next 
developments,'' said Yukihiko Hashimoto, senior foreign exchange 
manager at Sanwa Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 131.82 yen, down  
from 132.70 yen late Monday but up from 131.65 yen in New York late 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices ended higher on Wall Street's  
overnight gains and active buying of blue chips by institutional 
investors who manage public and pension funds, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also helping the stock market was an announcement Monday by the  
Financial Reconstruction Commission that major Japanese banks will 
be required to make provisions covering 70 percent of their 
unguaranteed loans to companies that ``may go bankrupt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules will apply to ``international class'' banks which  
apply for public funds under the government's plan to recapitalize 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting rid of the massive bad debts held by banks is considered  
a major step in helping Japan's recession-hit economy get back on 
track. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section gained 11.17 points, or 1.02 percent, to 1,109.88. 
The TOPIX closed up 1.42 points, or 0.13 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section was estimated at 500 million shares,  
up from 396.15 million shares Monday. Advancing issues outnumbered 
retreaters 828 to 335, with 138 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese  
government bond fell to 1.715 percent from 1.780 percent late 
Monday. Its price rose to 100.68 yen from 100.16 yen.

<HEADLINE> McDonald's Profits Rise 9 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- McDonald's Corp. said Tuesday its fourth-quarter  
profits rose 9 percent, with strong sales in the United States and 
Europe offsetting weaker revenues caused by economic troubles 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also announced a 2-for-1 stock split effective March  
5. McDonald's share price has risen 61 percent in the past year on 
strong confidence in the company's domestic turnaround strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	For the three months that ended Dec. 31, the Oak Brook,  
Ill.-based chain reported net income of $447.1 million, or 64 cents 
a diluted share, compared to $410.9 million, or 58 cents a diluted 
share, in the comparable period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Both quarters include charges taken to restructure and introduce  
a just-in-time ordering system to domestic restaurants. Excluding 
those, income rose 13 percent to $783.2 million from $695.2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings matched Wall Street expectations, according to a  
survey of analysts by First Call Corp. In trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange, shares of McDonald's rose $3.06 1/4, or 4 percent, to 
close at $78.93 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Systemwide sales rose 9 percent to $3.22 billion from $2.95  
billion. The company does not reveal exact figures from stores open 
at least a year, an industry measure of performance, but said it 
saw ``positive'' results. 
</P>
<P>
	During the year, the company capitalized on its promotion tie-in  
with Disney to increase its Happy Meal sales. It also benefited 
from increased sales of larger sandwiches with Monopoly, Big Mac 
and Teenie Beanie Baby promotions. The company this year plans to 
revive Teenie Beanie Babies for a third time; analysts say the 
previous two promotions are the all-time leaders in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say McDonald's has experienced a remarkable turnaround  
in the past year as it decentralized its domestic operations to 
give grumbling franchisees more say in developing their menus and 
planning promotions. The company also has benefited from increased 
expansion overseas, particularly in Europe, where revenues soon 
will exceed domestic sales despite having far fewer restaurants per 
capita.

<HEADLINE> German Metalworker Talks Stall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- A fourth round of wage talks for some  
800,000 metalworkers broke off Tuesday, prompting threats of 
widespread warning strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Strikes and protests could begin in the North-Rhine Westphalia  
state on Monday, said a spokeswoman for the powerful IG Metall 
metalworkers union, which claims some 2.7 million members. 
</P>
<P>
	The employers association, Gesamtmetall, has offered union  
negotiators a 2 percent wage increase, plus a one-time lump sum 
payment and an optional Christmas bonus depending on individual 
company earnings. Employees are lobbying for 6.5 percent pay 
raises. 
</P>
<P>
	IG Metall union deputy chairman, Juergen Peters, on Monday  
called the employers' offer ``crummy,'' and threatened warning 
strikes as early as Friday if a satisfactory offer isn't made. 
</P>
<P>
	An agreement preventing strikes during wage negotiations expires  
at midnight Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Warning strikes last year ended with metalworkers getting 2.6  
percent increases, but with many companies, including automakers, 
claiming high profits for 1998, IG Metall says workers deserve a 
higher share of the income. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-round talks in other German negotiating districts were  
continuing this week.

<HEADLINE> Grains Gain on Export Hopes / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain futures prices advanced Tuesday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade amid hopes for new export business, while 
soybean futures retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures experienced the largest gains as market  
participants grew concerned about high winds and a lack of colder 
temperatures in southern winter wheat growing areas. Such 
conditions leave the young crops vulnerable to a late-season cold 
snap as they emerge from dormancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures also found support on expectations that Pakistan  
will purchase U.S. wheat in coming days. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures rose on the strength in wheat and amid technical  
buying following days of losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures, however, were unable to hold their own as  
investors eyed forecasts for beneficial rain this week in Argentina 
and Brazil, which competes with the United States for export 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery rose 1 1/2 cents to $2.71 a bushel; March  
corn rose 1/4 cent to $2.15 3/4 a bushel; March oats were unchanged at 
$1.06 3/4 a bushel; March soybeans fell 3 1/2 cents to $5.14 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures were mostly lower on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, with pork futures falling sharply amid concern 
the pace of slaughters will slow and allow herds to build. 
</P>
<P>
	February live cattle fell .40 cent to 62.80 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle fell .77 cent to 73.75 cents a pound; February lean 
hogs fell 1.62 cents to 42.80 cents a pound; February pork bellies 
fell .40 cent to 55.35 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- A lawmaker wants Massachusetts  
residents to see out the millennium at their leisure. 
</P>
<P>
	State Rep. John F. Merrigan is filing legislation making Dec.  
31, 1999, a legal holiday in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only going to happen once in our lifetimes,'' Merrigan  
said of his bill declaring the day a ``Millennium Holiday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Merrigan represents Greenfield, a western Massachusetts town  
that is getting into the millennium spirit. 
</P>
<P>
	Town workers will have this year's New Year's Eve off, and last  
week the Southwick-Tolland Regional School Committee voted to give 
students off the first week of January 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The holiday may have a decent chance of winning passage in the  
Statehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, this is a state in which the day the British were  
forced to retreat from the city is known as Evacuation Day, which 
just happens to fall on St. Patrick's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	And state workers get Patriots Day off as well, which happens to  
fall on the same April day as the running of the Boston Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	So why not Millennium Day?  
</P>
<P>
	``It's only going to happen once in a thousand years,'' Merrigan  
said.

<HEADLINE> Author Sarah Delany Dies at 109 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sarah ``Sadie'' Delany, who became a  
best-selling author at 104 with her and her sister's reminiscences 
of a century of achievement as black women, has died. She was 109. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Delany died in her sleep Monday at the suburban New York  
City home she had shared with her sister, said her nephew, Harry 
Delany. Bessie Delany died in 1995 at the age of 104. 
</P>
<P>
	The two spry and witty women were celebrated as independent and  
educated, with the gumption and humor to sustain them during the 
early days of the century in their native North Carolina to Harlem 
and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	They wrote ``Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100  
Years'' with journalist Amy Hill Hearth. Published in 1993, in 
includes matter-of-fact references to the degradation they 
witnessed: the post-slavery years, segregation laws and violent 
racism. Bessie was nearly lynched once, as a young woman, after a 
run-in with a white at a railroad station. 
</P>
<P>
	There were triumphs too -- their impressive family saga, their  
pride in the 1960s civil rights movement and their success in the 
world of work in an age when most women stayed home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never let prejudice stop me from what I wanted to do in this  
life,'' Sadie once said. 
</P>
<P>
	The book sold millions and has become a high school and college  
text as well as a play, ``Having Our Say,'' which ran on Broadway 
in 1995 and was nominated for three Tony awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best tribute we can pay to Ms. Sadie Delany and Dr. Bessie  
Delany is to honor the memory of what they were,'' said Camille 
Cosby, the wife of actor Bill Cosby and producer of a CBS 
made-for-television movie based on the sisters' book, which is to 
air in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The sisters, who described themselves as ``best friends from Day  
One,'' and their eight brothers and sisters grew up on the campus 
of St. Augustine's College in Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Their father, freed from slavery as a child, became a vice  
principal of the school and America's first elected black Episcopal 
bishop. Their mother helped run the school while instilling 
self-discipline, compassion and confidence in her children, what 
Bessie once called ``a lot of love and good, sound, honest 
teaching.'' All 10 went on to attend college. 
</P>
<P>
	In their writing and in person, the sisters' contrasting  
personalities were plain -- Bessie the sharp-tongued spitfire, Sadie 
the mild-mannered one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sadie is molasses without even trying,'' her sister once said.  
``She can sweet-talk the world, or play dumb, or whatever it takes 
to get by without a fuss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if Sadie was molasses, Bessie would say, ``then I am  
vinegar! Sadie is sugar and I'm the spice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two migrated to New York in their 20s and got degrees from  
Columbia University. Along the way, they met intellectuals Booker 
T. Washington and W.E.B. Du Bois, entertainers Cab Calloway and 
Lena Horne and actor Paul Robeson, and thrived in white society. 
Both had successful careers -- Sadie as a high school teacher, 
Bessie as a dentist. 
</P>
<P>
	Sadie became the first black domestic-science teacher in New  
York City public schools, and also had a candy business for a time. 
Bessie opened a dental office in Harlem. Neither ever married. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people ask me how we've lived past 100, I say, `Honey, we  
never married; we never had husbands to worry us to death,''' 
Bessie said. 
</P>
<P>
	Advised Sadie: ``Don't get married just because he looks pretty.  
He's got to have good genes, and have some sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1957, the sisters moved to Mount Vernon, a New York suburb.  
Bessie retired in 1950 to care for their mother, Sadie in 1960. 
Past the century mark, they continued to do yoga exercises and kept 
up with current events. 
</P>
<P>
	``They think that old people haven't got any sense,'' Sadie  
said. ``You do slow up as you get old. But you certainly can be 
wiser than you were.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hearth, more than 65 years their junior, first interviewed  
them for a newspaper story and persuaded them that their story 
merited a book. The three followed up with ``The Delany Sisters' 
Book of Everyday Wisdom'' in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doing quality work -- that's what brings you self-respect and  
that's something folks seem mixed up about today,'' Sadie wrote. 
``You hear all this talk about self-esteem or self-respect, as if 
it were something other people could give you. But what 
self-respect really means is knowing that you are a person of value 
rather than thinking `I am special' in a self-congratulatory way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Delany's last book, ``On My Own at 107: Reflections on a  
Life Without Bessie,'' appeared in 1997. She is survived by 14 
nieces and nephews.

<HEADLINE> White House Lawyers Change Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's legal team is resigned  
that witnesses will be questioned in the Senate impeachment trial 
and is developing a strategy to counter the unwanted turn of events 
with a new round of political and legal attacks, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	First and foremost is a warning that the move to witnesses may  
significantly delay the trial because presidential lawyers will 
need extensive time to review previously unseen evidence and 
interview their own witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's lawyer, David Kendall, and several Democratic  
senators picked up that theme at the trial Tuesday as the prospects 
improved that House prosecutors would get to summon the three 
witnesses they sought: former White House intern Monica Lewinsky; 
White House aide Sidney Blumenthal; and presidential friend Vernon 
Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately, presidential advisers said there is a chance despite  
their publicly stated position that they won't demand any witnesses 
or evidence of their own until they see what information 
prosecutors elicit from the witnesses and whether those witnesses 
will ever be questioned in person at the Senate trial. Many of the 
lawyers are in a wait-and-see mode, advisers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is quite possible, and some are urging this, that if there  
are no new revelations in the depositions and no request to have 
live witnesses in the well of the Senate, that we won't need to 
call witnesses,'' said one outside adviser to the White House 
involved in the planning, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	But presidential lawyers also are preparing for the all-out  
trial strategy if necessary. They realize that in an environment 
where senators can vote to limit their presentation -- some 
Republican senators are talking about giving the White House 
lawyers only three witnesses of their own -- they may need to 
identify witnesses who could make the best case possible for the 
president against the perjury and obstruction of justice charges. 
</P>
<P>
	On that front, House prosecutors' efforts to introduce some  
surprise evidence at the trial Tuesday left White House lawyers 
considering an unexpected avenue to demand a group of witnesses 
they had figured would be off limits, advisers inside and outside 
the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
	These advisers, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it is  
possible that if the trial drags on, Clinton's lawyers will try to 
summon lawyers for Paula Jones to explore whether they colluded 
with Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr in January 1998 to bring the 
Lewinsky matter to light. 
</P>
<P>
	For weeks, presidential lawyers have argued that the Jones  
matter should be kept outside the trial because the House rejected 
an impeachment article that alleged Clinton had committed perjury 
in Mrs. Jones' civil case. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Tuesday, House prosecutors surprised senators and the  
White House legal team by introducing as new evidence an affidavit 
submitted by one of Mrs. Jones' lawyers, T. Wesley Holmes, to the 
House prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ordinarily, Clinton's team would have no right to question Mrs.  
Jones' lawyers because of her attorney-client privilege, although 
they have long wanted to explore what sort of contacts her lawyers 
had with Starr in the days before the scandal erupted a year ago. 
Legal advisers are exploring whether Holmes' submission of the 
affidavit amounted to a waiver of Mrs. Jones' privilege to 
confidential legal advice. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes' affidavit dealt with the Jones camp's decision to  
subpoena presidential secretary Betty Currie as a witness in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall told senators on Tuesday that Holmes' decision to file  
an affidavit was ``exceedingly interesting'' and suggested he might 
want to explore the Jones-Starr question during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would be a very interesting witness to depose, let me tell  
you,'' Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of Paula Jones' lawyers talking about offering a  
declaration about his litigation strategy, and I think that the 
opportunity to depose him would provide a great deal of information 
about what really motivated the events of January 1998,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we could show that there were a number of connections  
between the independent counsel, Linda Tripp, and the Paula Jones 
lawyers,'' Kendall said.

<HEADLINE>  Sixers' Iverson Signs $71M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- No matter where Allen Iverson goes or how  
many defenders he baffles, the critics are always in close pursuit. 
They say he's cocky, selfish, too enamored of old friends from a 
troubled past. 
</P>
<P>
	Ready or not, Iverson signed a six-year, $70.9 million contract  
extension with the Philadelphia 76ers on Tuesday that gave him much 
more than a raise. Flashing a smile to team president Pat Croce, 
this enigmatic 23-year-old took on the pressure of becoming one of 
the top young stars in the NBA's post-Jordan era. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to win the most championships,'' Iverson said. ``And I  
want to be the best player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The job began as soon as Iverson finished signing his name.  
Iverson will get the maximum for a player entering his third season 
in the league, Croce said. He will get $9 million next season with 
annual raises of $1.1 million that add up to $14.6 million in the 
final year of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to wait until the end of the year and then  
decide whether to play for a contender,'' Iverson said. ``I never 
wanted to take the easy way out. I've been here through the bad 
times, I want to be here through the good. I pretty much knew what 
time it was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is the largest contract ever guaranteed by the Sixers,  
hurtling Iverson past the likes of Julius Erving, Wilt Chamberlain 
and Charles Barkley. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were no snags on our part,'' Croce said. ``I know Allen,  
and I know he's a winner. I know he's a good guy. That smile can 
break you down like his crossover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agent David Falk said Iverson wanted to stay in Philadelphia all  
along, but he got a final push from his mother and former 
Georgetown coach John Thompson to stay with the Sixers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took their best player and they didn't get into the game  
of a negotiation,'' Falk said. ``Allen reciprocated and said, 
`Thanks. I want to be here, and enough's enough.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson's chance to strike it super-rich with a $100 million  
contract -- like those signed by Kevin Garnett, Antonio McDyess and 
Shawn Kemp -- was wiped out by the lockout. According to the NBA's 
new collective bargaining agreement, a player with up to six years 
experience can receive as much as 25 percent of his team's salary 
cap, beginning at a maximum of $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	His 1998-99 salary of $3.5 million is prorated for a 50-game  
schedule, reducing it to $2.2 million -- a loss of more than $1.3 
million due to the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to make enough money to take care of my  
family,'' Iverson said. ``The money that's out there for me right 
now is enough for me to do so. If the Sixers were going to give me 
$100 million, I would be a fool not to take it. I have a family and 
I want to know how my future's going to look financially. But it's 
not all about money all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson is feared for his speed and crossover dribble, yet  
criticized for ongoing legal problems and judged on his appearance 
and choice of friends. Along with incredible skill and 
competitiveness, he brings a street-kid look to the court with his 
braids, jewelry and tattoos running up and down each arm. Barkley 
once called him Allen ``Me, Myself and Iverson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, legal problems haunted Iverson again.  
Mercedes-Benz Credit Corp. sued Iverson for more than $28,500 in 
unpaid lease payments on three late-model cars. The suit also asks 
for the return of the cars and for the total buyout amount, about 
$300,000, on the 24-month lease vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know until the article came out,'' Iverson said. ``It  
was something that my accountant was supposed to handle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falk said Iverson's lawyers were ``putting the final wrinkles on  
that.'' Though Croce was willing to let his championship hopes rest 
with Iverson, he still worries about him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's young, and I know he's giving of himself and of his  
riches to his friends and family to a fault,'' Croce said. ``So I 
always worry about him, because he's not someone who will say no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Iverson had waited until July 1, he could have negotiated  
with any team for a seven-year contract worth more than $86 
million. But he said he wants to stay in Philadelphia, despite his 
past grievances with coach Larry Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just had to mature,'' Iverson said. ``I realized that he was  
a great coach when I looked at his resume. It was important for me 
to put my pride aside and listen to what was said to me as a 
positive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just young, I had to do a lot of growing up.''

<HEADLINE> NTSB: Denver's Plane Short of Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government on Tuesday wrapped up its  
investigation of the 1997 airplane crash that killed singer John 
Denver, blaming the accident on fuel problems and Denver's 
inexperience with his new experimental plane. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board, in a 5-0 vote, said  
the probable cause was threefold: Denver took off with too little 
fuel in one tank, had trouble switching to his backup tank and 
inadvertently put his plane into a roll while his attention was 
diverted. 
</P>
<P>
	The board said contributing factors included the plane builder's  
decision to relocate the fuel tank selector handle and an absence 
of markings on the handle and nearby fuel gauges, as well as 
Denver's lack of training in his new plane. It crashed Oct. 12, 
1997, off Pacific Grove, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The board urged the Federal Aviation Administration and the  
Experimental Aircraft Association to develop a program under which 
new pilots of experimental planes -- like the one Denver was flying 
-- would receive formalized training before their first flights. 
Board members noted the planes are sometimes difficult to handle. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not just somebody who flew his (Cessna) 172 around the  
pattern,'' said board member Robert T. Francis. ``This was an 
experienced pilot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 53-year-old singer-songwriter, famous for such hits as  
``Rocky Mountain High'' and ``Sunshine on My Shoulders,'' was the 
lone passenger when his plane plunged about 150 feet straight into 
the waters off California's Monterey Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
	He had bought the aircraft only two weeks earlier and had  
limited flying time as its pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	After hearing from its investigators, the board concluded that  
Denver's plane had only about three gallons of fuel in its left 
tank when he took off from the Monterey Peninsula Airport in the 
late afternoon to practice takeoffs and landings. The right tank 
had only about six gallons, but Denver declined an offer to refuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said they heard a sputter, and investigators theorize  
that Denver ran out of fuel in the left tank and had trouble 
switching to his right tank. 
</P>
<P>
	The plans for Denver's homemade Long E-Z say the fuel selector  
handle, which switches the fuel flow between the left and right 
tanks, should be located between the pilot's legs. But the plane's 
builder, Texas aircraft maker Adrian Davis Jr., told investigators 
he put it behind the pilot's left shoulder because he did not want 
fuel in the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
	On the day of the crash, Denver and a maintenance technician  
talked about the inaccessibility of the handle. ``They tried a pair 
of Vise Grip pliers on the handle to extend the reach of the 
handle, but this did not work,'' said one investigative report. 
</P>
<P>
	Under those circumstances, the pilot would have had to remove  
his shoulder harness, turn around and switch the handle. While 
doing so, the pilot would press on the plane's right rudder pedal, 
causing the aircraft to roll. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigators told the board that Denver may have been  
unfamiliar with the plane's fuel gauges and the fuel tank selector 
handle because they were not marked. 
</P>
<P>
	The selector, for example, pointed to the left for the right  
tank, to the right for the left tank and in between for ``OFF.'' 
There were no placards or other markers designating those 
positions, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the fuel gauges -- with vertical windows showing the  
fuel in each wing tank -- can be misleading because they do not 
represent the volume in a linear fashion. When the fuel rises to 
one-quarter on the window, for example, it does not indicate that 
the 26-gallon tank is one-quarter full. In reality, it contains 
less than 5 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
	The EAA, a widely praised private group, has developed a program  
to teach many first-time pilots how to make a safe transition to 
their new planes. The safety board now wants the FAA and EAA to 
require more formalized training for pilots of experimental planes. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the board recommended that the FAA require markings on  
vital aircraft controls such as the fuel gauge and fuel tank 
selector handle, and also demand that the markings be inspected 
annually.

<HEADLINE> $5.4B Budget Deficit Recorded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Social Security payments caused the federal  
government to run a $5.4 billion deficit in December, compared with 
a $13.6 billion surplus a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The December deficit caused an increased deficit for the first  
quarter of fiscal 1999, which began Oct. 1. The deficit for the 
first three months of the year totaled $55 billion, up 39 percent 
from the first quarter of the previous fiscal year, the Treasury 
Department said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	It noted that Social Security payments, normally scheduled to be  
mailed Jan. 3, which fell on a Sunday, were instead sent on Dec. 
31. That raised Social Security spending to $66.4 billion in 
December, compared with $35.6 billion a year earlier, and pushed 
total spending to a monthly record of $184.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate tax payments from October through December totaled  
$47.6 billion, down 7.1 percent from the same period a year 
earlier. Individual income-tax payments during the quarter were up 
6.4 percent from a year earlier to $187.6 billion. But individual 
payments had increased 12.4 percent in fiscal 1998.

<HEADLINE> J. Peterman Files for Chapter 11 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- The J. Peterman Co., the upscale retailer  
parodied on ``Seinfeld,'' will be allowed to operate through Feb. 
12 under a $1.96 million loan from a primary creditor. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for J. Peterman sealed the deal a day after filing for  
U.S. Bankruptcy Court protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Under motions granted by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge William S.  
Howard, the company will be able to pay its approximately 500 
employees, pay $235,000 owed to United Parcel Service and process 
returned and exchanged merchandise which has been backing up since 
the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	J. Peterman, which earned notoriety as the target of satire on  
the top-rated television comedy, filed Monday for protection under 
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which enables a company to 
keep operating under a court's supervision while it develops a plan 
for returning to solvency. 
</P>
<P>
	In papers submitted to the court as part of the filing, founder  
John Peterman listed assets of $35 million and liabilities of $40 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The next hearing in the case was scheduled for Feb. 8.  
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Tuesday, Peterman portrayed the bankruptcy as an  
opportunity for the company to seek new financing and ownership 
after setbacks in an effort to expand into 70 retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Slow catalog sales and delays in opening new stores, including  
one in New York's Grand Central Terminal, combined to create 
inventory overstocks and push the privately held company into debt, 
Peterman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have generated a significant amount of interest from  
outside parties in financing the company,'' he said. ``I am quite 
confident that we will pull the fat out of the fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peterman, a 57-year-old former minor league baseball player and  
marketing consultant, first started selling vintage duster coats in 
1987 through ads in the back of The New Yorker and The Wall Street 
Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	When Peterman published his first catalogs in 1988, they were  
something new: consciously upscale, with color sketches of the 
merchandise instead of photographs and lyrical copy that invested 
the merchandise with a romantic, exotic history. Printed on heavy 
paper and dubbed an ``Owner's Manual,'' Peterman's book of what he 
called ``factual romance'' was meant to be kept. 
</P>
<P>
	Other catalog companies followed ,and the goal became, ``How do  
I get people to hold onto this, keep it like a magazine?'' said 
Wendy Liebmann, who publishes a New York-based retail industry 
newsletter. ``J. Peterman was one of the first to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was definitely a trendsetter in terms of changing the  
paradigm of what a catalog looks like and in terms of the 
relationship with the customer,'' said Chris Merritt of the retail 
consulting firm Kurt Salmon Associates. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, shortly before ``Seinfeld'' went off the air,  
Peterman announced an expansion into retail that included plans for 
50 stores and 20 catalog outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	The company raised $10 million from outside investors, recruited  
executives from J. Crew, Calvin Klein and The Gap, and opened 12 
stores in addition to its Lexington flagship. 
</P>
<P>
	Liebmann, who visited the Peterman store in New York, said it  
failed to fully capture the catalog's attractions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mystique of J. Peterman has traditionally been that  
dialogue between Mr. Peterman and his audience that for a long time 
was translated so uniquely through the written word,'' Liebmann 
said. ``You then open a retail store. How do you communicate the 
same intimacy?'' 
</P>
<P>
	With store sales lagging $6 million behind projections and  
catalog sales down, Peterman said he tried to bring in $30 million 
in new investment, but current investors refused. Last month, the 
company laid off 20 people in Lexington and put a freeze on new 
store openings through mid-1999.

<HEADLINE>  Sixers' Iverson Signs $71M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- No matter where Allen Iverson goes or how  
many defenders he baffles, the critics are always in close pursuit. 
They say he's cocky, selfish, too enamored of old friends from a 
troubled past. 
</P>
<P>
	Ready or not, Iverson signed a six-year, $70.9 million contract  
extension with the Philadelphia 76ers on Tuesday that gave him much 
more than a raise. Flashing a smile to team president Pat Croce, 
this enigmatic 23-year-old took on the pressure of becoming one of 
the top young stars in the NBA's post-Jordan era. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to win the most championships,'' Iverson said. ``And I  
want to be the best player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The job began as soon as Iverson finished signing his name.  
Iverson will get the maximum for a player entering his third season 
in the league, Croce said. He will get $9 million next season with 
annual raises of $1.1 million that add up to $14.6 million in the 
final year of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to wait until the end of the year and then  
decide whether to play for a contender,'' Iverson said. ``I never 
wanted to take the easy way out. I've been here through the bad 
times, I want to be here through the good. I pretty much knew what 
time it was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is the largest contract ever guaranteed by the Sixers,  
hurtling Iverson past the likes of Julius Erving, Wilt Chamberlain 
and Charles Barkley. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were no snags on our part,'' Croce said. ``I know Allen,  
and I know he's a winner. I know he's a good guy. That smile can 
break you down like his crossover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agent David Falk said Iverson wanted to stay in Philadelphia all  
along, but he got a final push from his mother and former 
Georgetown coach John Thompson to stay with the Sixers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took their best player and they didn't get into the game  
of a negotiation,'' Falk said. ``Allen reciprocated and said, 
`Thanks. I want to be here, and enough's enough.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson's chance to strike it super-rich with a $100 million  
contract -- like those signed by Kevin Garnett, Antonio McDyess and 
Shawn Kemp -- was wiped out by the lockout. According to the NBA's 
new collective bargaining agreement, a player with up to six years 
experience can receive as much as 25 percent of his team's salary 
cap, beginning at a maximum of $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	His 1998-99 salary of $3.5 million is prorated for a 50-game  
schedule, reducing it to $2.2 million -- a loss of more than $1.3 
million due to the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to make enough money to take care of my  
family,'' Iverson said. ``The money that's out there for me right 
now is enough for me to do so. If the Sixers were going to give me 
$100 million, I would be a fool not to take it. I have a family and 
I want to know how my future's going to look financially. But it's 
not all about money all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson is feared for his speed and crossover dribble, yet  
criticized for ongoing legal problems and judged on his appearance 
and choice of friends. Along with incredible skill and 
competitiveness, he brings a street-kid look to the court with his 
braids, jewelry and tattoos running up and down each arm. Barkley 
once called him Allen ``Me, Myself and Iverson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, legal problems haunted Iverson again.  
Mercedes-Benz Credit Corp. sued Iverson for more than $28,500 in 
unpaid lease payments on three late-model cars. The suit also asks 
for the return of the cars and for the total buyout amount, about 
$300,000, on the 24-month lease vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know until the article came out,'' Iverson said. ``It  
was something that my accountant was supposed to handle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falk said Iverson's lawyers were ``putting the final wrinkles on  
that.'' Though Croce was willing to let his championship hopes rest 
with Iverson, he still worries about him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's young, and I know he's giving of himself and of his  
riches to his friends and family to a fault,'' Croce said. ``So I 
always worry about him, because he's not someone who will say no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Iverson had waited until July 1, he could have negotiated  
with any team for a seven-year contract worth more than $86 
million. But he said he wants to stay in Philadelphia, despite his 
past grievances with coach Larry Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just had to mature,'' Iverson said. ``I realized that he was  
a great coach when I looked at his resume. It was important for me 
to put my pride aside and listen to what was said to me as a 
positive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just young, I had to do a lot of growing up.''

	Senate To Vote on Dismissal  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate has wrapped up a four-hour  
closed-door session in which senators debated whether witnesses 
should be questioned at President Clinton's impeachment trial. When 
the court of impeachment reconvenes Wednesday in public session, 
senators will vote on Democrat Robert Byrd's motion to dismiss the 
case. If the motion fails, senators will immediately vote on 
whether witnesses should be questioned. The White House said 
Clinton has no intention of submitting to questioning, while his 
lawyers warned that issuing subpoenas would cause long delays in 
the proceedings.

	Pope Makes 5th U.S. Visit  
</P>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Pope John Paul II paid a visit Tuesday to  
America's heartland, where he decried teen suicide and hopelessness 
and likened the legal battle over abortion and euthanasia to the 
clash over slavery on the eve of the Civil War. ``There is 
something terribly wrong when so many people are overcome by 
hopelessness to the point of taking their own lives,'' the pope 
said at a youth rally at the Kiel Center, where his somber message 
stood in stark contrast to the rock-star welcome he got from the 
jubilant crowd of 20,000. John Paul, making his fifth trip to the 
U.S. mainland, arrived in St. Louis for a 30-hour stay after a 
triumphant, five-day visit to Mexico City.

	ARMENIA, Colombia (AP) -- Colombia's president is promising more  
than $12 million to rebuild homes in his quake-damaged country. 
This comes as survivors of the worst earthquake to hit Colombia in 
more than a century anxiously awaited relief supplies Tuesday and 
prayed for signs of life under the rubble. The confirmed death toll 
from one of the worst earthquakes to hit Colombia in more than a 
century reached 700 and relief workers think the toll will surpass 
2,000. The quake devastated cities and villages across western 
Colombia, where much of the world's coffee is grown. Authorities 
say they need help, tons of it: tents, food, forklifts, backhoes, 
antibiotics, generators -- and body bags.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Most cases of Parkinson's disease are caused by  
environmental factors and are not due to a genetic defect, 
according to a landmark study of more than 17,000 twins. ``For the 
first time, today we can say that for people with Parkinson's 
disease diagnosed after age 50, it's most commonly caused by 
environmental factors,'' said Dr. Caroline M. Tanner of the 
Parkinson's Institute in Sunnyvale, Calif., who led the study

<HEADLINE> 'Varsity Blues' Holds Onto Top Spot / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- James Van Der Beek, television's latest youth  
heartthrob, clung to the top of the box office charts during a 
lackluster weekend that saw a Sharon Stone film debut at a 
disappointing No. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	``Varsity Blues,'' starring Van Der Beek of the WB's ``Dawson's

	``Patch Adams'' starring Robin Williams was second with $8.1  
million, followed by John Travolta's ``A Civil Action'' with $7.6

<HEADLINE> Bullet Trains' U.S. Future in Doubt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Florida had what seemed to be a visionary plan  
to reduce airport crowding and traffic congestion: Build a 200-mph 
train that would whisk tourists and the like between Orlando, Tampa 
and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	But the state's new governor, Jeb Bush, killed the project nine  
days after taking office. The move cast doubt not only on the 
future of high-speed rail in Florida, but also in the rest of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	On the same day, the General Accounting Office told Congress  
that most of the 10 other high-speed corridors under development in 
the United States ``have not determined their funding sources'' -- a 
stop, look and listen warning for high speed. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 include the Gulf Coast, the Texas Triangle, Midwest  
corridors between Chicago, Detroit, St. Louis and Minneapolis, plus 
similar tracks through California, the Southeast, upstate New York 
and the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	The auditors concluded: ``These systems may be an effective  
alternative in corridors where travel is increasing and it is 
difficult to expand highway and airport capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, high-speed rail systems are costly, and thus  
ridership levels may not be high enough in the United States for 
systems to cover their costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An exception is in the Northeast Corridor, where Amtrak will  
begin operating 150-mph trains between Boston, New York and 
Washington in October. Amtrak expects its high-speed trains to help 
revive the financially strapped national railroad, as well as 
provide momentum for the proposed systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``High-speed rail is not just a metropolitan solution; it is a  
solution also for my part of the country,'' John Robert Smith, 
mayor of Meridian, Miss., and a member of Amtrak's board of 
directors, said last year. 
</P>
<P>
	High-speed trains are typically defined as those capable of  
traveling more than 125 mph. They achieve those speeds either with 
special tracks and locomotives or through technology allowing 
trains to tilt into existing curves. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan, France and Germany, three nations with long rail  
histories, have taken the lead in developing such systems. When 
France opened its first TGV line between Paris and Lyon in the late 
1980s, the internal French airline, Air Inter, had to cut back on 
its service because the 180-mph TGV was faster. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, when a 175-mph InterCity Express train crashed near  
Eschede, Germany, killing 101 people, it was a blow to the national 
psyche. The trains were viewed as a symbol of German innovation and 
over their 10-year history had become an integral part of the 
country's travel network. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida project was to have mirrored such foreign  
innovation. 
</P>
<P>
	The late Gov. Lawton Chiles signed a deal in 1996 with Florida  
Overland eXpress, a private consortium. It planned to run 
French-designed trains on new tracks that would cross existing 
obstacles with underpasses and overpasses, instead of traditional 
grade crossings. The project carried a price tag of up to $8 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush questioned the projected ridership and whether the routes  
might lead to unwelcome development around the Everglades. His 
biggest concern, though, was money. The state had already committed 
to $28 million to the project. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are better alternatives for $70 million per year  
compounded at 4 percent,'' the newly elected governor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anne Chettle, spokeswoman for the Washington-based High Speed  
Ground Transportation Association, said Bush's decision shows why 
if high-speed rail is to spread across the United States, it will 
have to be done in increments. 
</P>
<P>
	Typically, that means straightening track curves, rebuilding  
existing stations and buying trains with higher top speeds -- 
exactly what Amtrak is doing in the Northeast Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
	``That seems to set lawmakers at ease, because it is not the big  
chunk of money they so often see advertised. It may not be the 
wisest use of money and actually lead to higher costs, but it seems 
to be the most palatable,'' Chettle said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Transportation Department is encouraging the approach by  
designating routes as ``high-speed rail corridors,'' making them 
eligible for special development money. Transportation Secretary 
Rodney Slater is traveling to the Midwest this week to make such a 
designation for the line between Chicago and Indianapolis. Amtrak 
currently makes one run a day between the cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the GAO's dire assessment, rail advocates believe  
high-speed trains can flourish in the United States, given the 
right approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're trying to do here is not really all or nothing,''  
said Amtrak spokesman John Wolf. ``If you use an incremental 
approach and build on existing rights of way in partnership with 
states and private businesses and freight railroads, we believe it 
will work.''

<HEADLINE> Torture Slayings Trial Winding Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- With no eyewitnesses to any killings,  
prosecutors are hoping to turn Charles Ng's defense against him as 
his 16-year serial murder case draws to a close. 
</P>
<P>
	Closing arguments were to resume today, with defense attorneys  
contesting allegations that Ng killed 12 people during 1984 and 
1985 in Northern California. He could receive the death penalty if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the trial began in October, the defense has tried to blame  
the killings on Ng's survivalist buddy Leonard Lake, who committed 
suicide in 1985 after he was questioned by police. Lake left behind 
rambling diaries and notes outlining plans to capture women for use 
as sex slaves and to kill men for their money and possessions. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Charles Ng and Leonard Lake together intended for these 12  
people to die, if they each performed acts to further that goal, 
then they are equally guilty in the eyes of the law,'' prosecutor 
Sharlene Honnaka told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Lake and Ng lured their prey to Lake's cabin in  
the Sierra Nevada foothills. Ng, arrested in Canada in 1985, fought 
extradition for five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Honnaka displayed a list of each victim: seven men, three women  
and two baby boys. She also reran videotapes prosecutors say were 
made at the cabin, tapes that show bound female victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can cry and stuff like the rest of them,'' Ng tells a tied  
and terrified Brenda O'Connor. ``It won't do you no good. We're 
pretty cold-hearted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the last known victims, O'Connor disappeared in April  
1985 along with her 1-year-old son Lonnie Bond Jr., his father 
Lonnie Bond and Robin Scott Stapley, a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	The final taxpayer bill for the case has been estimated at $14  
million.

<HEADLINE> Intel Yields to Privacy Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Facing criticism over privacy issues, Intel  
Corp. reversed itself and promised it will disable a new technology 
that helps identify consumers as they move across the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers can use software to activate the technology in its  
upcoming line of Pentium III computer processors, Intel spokesman 
Chuck Mulloy said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, the world's largest computer chip-maker with $26.2  
billion in sales last year, announced last week that its newest 
Pentium chip would by default transmit its unique serial number 
internally and to Web sites that requested it to help verify a 
user's identity. 
</P>
<P>
	But hours after privacy groups organized a boycott Monday, Intel  
said it will provide software that turns off the feature by default 
in future copies of its Pentium III processors, not yet distributed 
to the world's computer makers. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also promised to offer the software to owners of  
existing Pentium III chips already in production, making it easy to 
permanently turn off the technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel won't need to redesign its chips.  
</P>
<P>
	The concession came only hours after a boycott was announced in  
Washington by privacy groups, which launched a campaign complete 
with a parody of the company's ubiquitous ``Intel Inside'' logo. 
Theirs featured the familiar swirl but with the words, ``Big 
Brother Inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This acknowledges that consumers want Intel inside their  
computer, not inside their private lives,'' said Rep. Ed Markey, 
D-Mass., who urged Intel last week to reconsider its plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel's reversal saves the company the risk of a protracted,  
ugly fight with consumers over privacy -- reminiscent of the 
company's awkward handling in 1994 of an obscure math flaw in its 
original Pentium chips. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Intel initially required outraged customers to  
justify their need for a replacement Pentium but weeks later 
reversed course and offered free replacements, along with an 
apology from its chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Intel said its new technology could be turned off but  
was reactivated whenever the computer was restarted. But on Monday, 
the company said that was a misunderstanding: The Pentium's ability 
to transmit its serial number is, in fact, reactivated, but the 
software ``switch'' still disables the feature until the consumer 
chooses to use the technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the technology offers a boon for electronic  
commerce, allowing companies and shoppers to feel more secure in 
the transmission of sensitive data. 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy groups involved in the boycott said they were  
``delighted that Intel has taken one small step toward respecting 
people's privacy,'' but said the boycott will continue until they 
see the details. 
</P>
<P>
	``You still have the problem of an ID number, and Web sites can  
force people to disclose that ID number as a condition to get into 
the sites,'' said David Banisar, an attorney with the 
Washington-based Electronic Privacy Information Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The privacy information center organized the boycott with  
Junkbusters Corp. of Green Brook, N.J., which lobbies on a range of 
high-tech issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission, which last year pressed for a law  
that prohibits Web sites from collecting personal information from 
children without parental permission, said the Intel debate 
``highlights consumer concerns about how confidential is various 
information for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This will certainly resonate on Capitol Hill and with the  
administration,'' said Jodie Bernstein, director of the FTC's 
consumer protection bureau.

<HEADLINE> IMF Fails To Push Continued Ukraine Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- An International Monetary Fund mission  
completed its visit to Ukraine on Tuesday without recommending the 
continuation of a vital $2.2 billion IMF loan package, a senior 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ukraine's Finance Ministry has warned that the former Soviet  
republic may default on its foreign debt payments this year unless 
outside donors such as the IMF and the World Bank resume their aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Ukraine must pay $1.17 billion to foreign creditors in 1999, and  
its National Bank, which only has about $1 billion in reserves, 
separately has to pay about $700 million to the IMF to repay 
earlier loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The current IMF mission arrived in Kiev earlier in the month to  
analyze Ukraine's progress with economic and other reforms and 
decide whether it qualifies for the resumption of the fund's aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund approved the three-year aid package for Ukraine last  
September. But the country received only $335 million of the loan 
before the IMF suspended it in November over the government's poor 
tax collection and slow reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	An IMF team that worked in Ukraine in December did not recommend  
that the fund release the next tranche of the credit, and the 
current mission followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, IMF mission leader Mohammed Shadman-Valavi said last  
week that Kiev needed to take radical measures to stop its 
protracted economic decline. On Tuesday, he noted progress in many 
issues on the agenda and indicated the mission could return to 
Ukraine soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential aide Valery Lytvytsky said IMF officials also have  
urged Ukraine to announce a new currency trading band and remove a 
series of regulations that have prevented foreign currency from 
being traded freely but have helped keep the hryvna stable. 
</P>
<P>
	Ukraine's National Bank is widely expected to announce new  
margins for the hryvna, now trading at 3.427 to the U.S. dollar ---- 
or just below the trading band's upper limit of 3.5 to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, analysts suggested that Ukraine's relations with the  
IMF were much more troubled than the government wanted to admit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prospect of the IMF and other international financial  
organizations freezing their relations with official Kiev is now as 
real as never before,'' Oleksiy Plotnykov of the independent 
Economic and Political Sciences Center told the UNIAN news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``A situation may arise in which Ukraine would be recognized as  
a bankrupt state,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> No Prediction From Bradshaw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Terry Bradshaw would just as soon be at home this  
week relaxing with his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like Super Bowls,'' he said Tuesday. ``But make no  
mistake, I love my job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Fox television studio co-host led the Pittsburgh Steelers to  
four Super Bowl titles in the 1970s and will be working his fifth 
as a pregame analyst on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Think that might make him a Super Bowl junkie of sorts? No way.  
</P>
<P>
	The Hall of Fame quarterback doesn't revel in the hype  
surrounding the game and isn't into the party scene, either. 
</P>
<P>
	He answered questions about himself, football and his job for  
more than an hour and plans to stay out of the spotlight for the 
remainder of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll read, play cards and golf,'' Bradshaw said. ``I've done  
all my preparation. I've done all my interviews.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For its coverage of the Falcons-Broncos game, Fox will use a  
Super Bowl-record 31 cameras and 25 video tape replay machines. An 
estimated 133.4 million viewers watched last year's game, and 
Sunday's telecast will be beamed to more than 100 countries and 
military installations around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradshaw caused a stir nine years ago when, annoyed that he was  
in New Orleans for an appearance during Super Bowl week, he 
criticized John Elway and told reporters he thought Denver would 
lose 55-3 to the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he said he was convinced the 49ers were a better team  
and would win easily, he predicted such a lopsided score because he 
was angry about having to stop in town on his way to San Antonio to 
give a speech. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't until he returned home a few days later that he  
realized he had created a furor. Letters and messages poured into 
his office and CBS responded by sending him back to New Orleans to 
-- of all things -- try to interview Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't get the interview, the 49ers won 55-10 and time has  
healed his relationship with the Broncos quarterback, who won a 
Super Bowl in his fourth try last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody changes. I said some things that weren't nice, and  
at the time I believed them,'' Bradshaw said. ``I don't feel the 
same way (now).'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also doesn't have a prediction for Sunday's game. He may save  
that for the pregame show, which will begin at 11 a.m. EST -- seven 
hours before kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, he had a notion that Atlanta was going to upset  
Minnesota in the NFC Championship game, but didn't go with it on 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Knowing there was a possibility he'd have to the face the  
Vikings in the locker room and hear from fans leaving the 
Metrodome, he predicted a victory for the home team. 
</P>
<P>
	He should have trusted his gut.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't stick to it. I couldn't believe myself,'' he said.  
``But I won't switch this time.''

<HEADLINE> Baptist Leader Said to Divert Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- When the Rev. Henry Lyons accepted a $225,000  
check to rebuild burned black churches, he sunk $60,000 in his 
savings account and spent part of the money to redecorate his house 
and pay off bills, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons had told the Anti-Defamation League the money would go  
immediately to ``the wheels that are squeaking the loudest.'' But 
prosecutors said he gave $12,000 to his wife, and sent money to 
love interests in Tennessee and Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rev. Lyons made it seem there was an urgency to this ... He  
indicated there were some churches that needed instruments of 
worship -- pews and Bibles,'' Amy Goldstein, former assistant 
director of national leadership for the Anti-Defamation League of 
B'nai B'rith, testified Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed to me they were in desperate need and the money  
would be disbursed immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons, president of the National Baptist Convention USA, is  
charged with racketeering and grand theft, accused of swindling 
money from corporations seeking to do business with the convention 
and stealing the ADL funds intended to rebuild churches. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Medin, the ADL's director of national leadership, said the  
organization's leaders first began questioning where the money went 
when they received telephone calls from reporters in the St. 
Petersburg area after prosecutors began investigating Lyons' 
finances. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons accepted the $225,000 check at the ADL's annual meeting in  
New York City in 1996, where he introduced three ministers from 
rural and impoverished burned churches. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Lyons actually had distributed less than $40,000  
to burned churches -- $10,000 each to three churches and $3,000 each 
to their pastors. 
</P>
<P>
	Under cross-examination, both Medin and Ms. Goldstein  
acknowledged the ADL had given Lyons no timeline or instructions 
for distributing the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons' defense lawyers told jurors in opening statements Monday  
that Lyons held the money in bank accounts while researching how 
best to distribute it, and returned the funds when the ADL asked 
him to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons and codefendant Bernice Edwards are charged with  
racketeering. They are accused of devising elaborate schemes to 
divert more than $4 million from corporations seeking to do 
business with the convention and then spending the money on 
expensive homes, diamond jewelry and luxury cars.

<HEADLINE> Japan Tour Splits With PGA of Japan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A golf revolt is under way in Japan.  
</P>
<P>
	Just as Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus helped pave the way 30  
years ago for what is now the PGA Tour, touring pros in Japan are 
prepared to break from the PGA of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japan Tour Players Club, former Japanese tour director  
Kosaku Shimada and the Golf Tournament Promotion Association have 
``decided to separate from the PGA Policy officials who wish to 
follow the old way and not see the changes needed for the upcoming 
age,'' said GTPA director Michio Torii. 
</P>
<P>
	The PGA of Japan operated much like the PGA of America -- one  
division for teaching professionals and one for tournament 
professionals. Two years ago, the PGA Tour of Japan was established 
to better serve players' needs. 
</P>
<P>
	The tour tried to become independent, but Torii says the four  
PGA of Japan members on the tour's policy board -- particularly 
chairman Fujio Ishii -- have ``rejected the basic premise of our 
tour organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shimada represents Japan on the International Federation of PGA  
Tours, which established the World Golf Championships. He was 
removed from office, then reinstated when the tour protested. 
Shimada since has quit on his own. 
</P>
<P>
	Shimada will run the new tour, which will be called Golf Tour of  
Japan. The tour has the support of virtually every tournament 
sponsor and is planning a 27-event schedule beginning in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The PGA of Japan will still run a few tournaments, such as the  
Kirin Open, although money won from those events will not count 
toward official money on the Golf Tour of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

	 *TEACHER CUP:* Another cup is on the line for the United States  
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Golf Teachers Cup is being played at Ballantrae Golf  
and Yacht Club in Port St. Lucie, Fla., featuring a team of 
American teaching pros against their counterparts from around the 
world. The U.S. team has won the last two cups. 
</P>
<P>
	``With international victories in the Ryder Cup and the  
Presidents Cup, we expect the overseas contingent to put up a 
strong challenge this year,'' said Geoff Byant, president of the 
U.S. Golf Teachers Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	About 125 teaching pros are competing for individual and team  
honors. The top six finishers from the United States, Canada, South 
America, Europe and Asia will compete for their respective team. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the 10th anniversary of the federation, which has the  
largest number of strictly golf teaching pros in the world -- more 
than 6,000 in the United States and 39 countries. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SKINS SUB:* Jim Colbert, who is replacing Jack Nicklaus in this  
weekend's Senior Skins Game in Hawaii, has experience as a 
last-minute substitution. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first year on the PGA Tour, Colbert was in Las Vegas when  
one of the tour officials asked him to fill in during the pro-am. 
</P>
<P>
	``I walk to the first tee and these guys give me a funny look,''  
Colbert recalled. ``I asked who they were supposed to play with and 
they said, 'Arnold Palmer.' They were a little disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, 30 years later, I'm taking Nicklaus' place.''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PLAYER LINKS:* The PGA Tour has delivered laptop computers to  
78 players, with more on the way. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Players Links Program'' is an attempt to develop an online  
relationship between the tour and its exempt players. Among other 
things, players can arrange travel, check the status of their 
retirement plan and commit to play in tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	The tour is adding a program that would show whether a course  
has changed from the last time a tournament was played, such as new 
bunkers or greens that have been rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
	The program will give the tour more immediate communication on a  
number of issues, and give players a chance to e-mail commissioner 
Tim Finchem with their concerns. Previously, the tour distributed a 
weekly ``green sheet'' with any news of note. 
</P>
<P>
	The program will have a mechanism that forces players to read  
any news update before doing anything else in the system. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have to rely on them actually reading the green  
sheet,'' Finchem said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DIVOTS:* There are two more cubs in the Golden Bear's den. Jack  
Nicklaus celebrated the birth of two grandchildren this month. ... 
Ping has put its five-year contract with Bernhard Langer on hold 
after claiming he was not using enough the minimum number of clubs 
required. ... The newest member of the Phoenix Open Hall of Fame is 
retired CBS golf producer Frank Chirkinian. Others previously 
honored by the Thunderbirds include Arnold Palmer, Byron Nelson, 
Karsten Solheim and Ben Hogan. ... IMG agent Hughes Norton will 
play with Notah Begay at Pebble Beach. Begay once caddied for 
Norton when his pro-am team won the AT&AMP;T. Of course, Norton's 
partner that year was David Duval. ... State Farm Insurance will 
remain the title sponsor for the LPGA Rail Charity Classic through 
2003. ... Greg Norman has scrapped plans to buy a Boeing 737, but

<HEADLINE> Dollar Little Changed Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar was little changed against the  
Japanese yen and the euro Tuesday in trading calmed by two strong 
days on Wall Street and speculation that Europe's new central bank 
was intervening to prop up the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's refused to move either way,'' Robert Houck, a currency  
vice president at Norwest Bank Corp. in Minneapolis, said about the 
dollar's lackluster trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.1553 in late New York trading,  
slipping from $1.1555 late Monday. The dollar was trading at 113.82 
yen, down from 113.96. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising U.S. stocks Monday and Tuesday set a firm tone for dollar  
trading, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising nearly 83 
points Monday and another 121.26 points Tuesday to close at 
9,324.58. Key stock indices in Tokyo, Hong Kong, London, Frankfurt 
and Paris edged higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar, however, was hurt in early trading against the yen  
after Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji announced the yuan would remain 
stable in 1999. The dollar has strengthened on reports that China 
would devalue its currency, a move that would hurt its neighbors, 
particularly Japan, which continues fighting its worst recession in 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	But Houck said ``what little bit of action we had'' came on  
reports later Tuesday that an unnamed U.S. Treasury official didn't 
envision the yen remaining strong against the dollar, coupled with 
a large order in dollar/yen trading. The Japanese currency rose 
above 114 yen ``in no time,'' Houck said, before drifting down for 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, traders speculated that the European Central Bank was  
quietly shifting funds in what is called a reserve adjustment. 
There was just enough movement to hold trading in check as 
investors refused to gamble on possible intervention by the ECB on 
behalf of its new currency, the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never really know if it's the ECB or just talk,'' Houck  
said. ``It's having a profound psychological effect on the market. 
We're refusing to bust out of this range.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 1.3888 Swiss francs, up from 1.3869,  
and 1.5191 Canadian dollars, up from 1.5178. The British pound rose 
to $1.6595 from $1.6567. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.6929 German 
marks, up from 1.6926; 5.6786 French francs, up from 5.6754; and 
1,675.04 Italian lire, unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Flees Washington for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Witness in the Clinton impeachment trial or  
not, Monica Lewinsky wasn't waiting around here to find out. She 
packed her designer bags and hightailed it out of town Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in a black coat with faux fur collar and carrying a  
leopard-print satchel, Ms. Lewinsky was tight-lipped as she breezed 
past velvet ropes holding back anxious media crews and onlookers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her state of mind is she wants to get out of town,'' said  
Plato Cacheris, Ms. Lewinsky's lawyer. ``She's been cooped up in 
the hotel, she's not able to leave and she wants to get on with her 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky left Washington's ritzy Mayflower Hotel as House  
prosecutors argued in favor of her testimony in the Senate trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Cacheris said she did not want to testify before the Senate, but  
``if she's needed, they issue a proper document to get her back 
here, she will return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both her lawyer and her spokeswoman declined to say where Ms.  
Lewinsky was headed. 
</P>
<P>
	Foot and car traffic slowed to a crawl outside the hotel as  
Lewinsky was ushered into a Toyota Land Cruiser. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel sorry for her. She's been through the wringer and I  
don't think she enjoys all these people gawking at her,'' said 
Laura Varner, 80, who was on her way to the National Geographic 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayflower spokeswoman Colleen Evans, who took note of Ms.  
Lewinsky's Kate Spade luggage, said hair stylists and manicurists 
had called the hotel offering their services to the former White 
House intern. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was just another historic fun fact for the Mayflower,''  
Evans said.

<HEADLINE> Flyers' Vanbiesbrouck Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Flyers goaltender John  
Vanbiesbrouck suffered only a bruised right buttock in a hard 
collision with the goal post Tuesday night in a 3-3 tie with the 
Florida Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanbiesbrouck left the game with 23 seconds remaining in the  
third period and is day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have to see how it feels,'' Vanbiesbrouck said.  
``Hopefully, it won't be too sore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The injury happened when Florida's Rob Niedermayer -- defended by  
Eric Desjardins -- skated in on Vanbiesbrouck. The puck went wide of 
the net, but Niedermayer skated into Vanbiesbrouck, who collided 
hard with the post and knocked the goal off its moorings 
</P>
<P>
	Vanbiesbrouck, who stopped 16 of 19 shots, skated gingerly to  
the dressing room. Ron Hextall replaced him for the final 23 
seconds of regulation and the overtime period and didn't face a 
shot.

<HEADLINE> White House Condemns Protectionism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration cautioned Congress  
today that erecting protectionist U.S. barriers as a response to a 
burgeoning trade deficit could seriously set back efforts to deal 
with the global financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's top economic policy-makers, led by Treasury  
Secretary Robert Rubin, were the leadoff witnesses as the Senate 
Finance Committee began a series of hearings aimed at overcoming 
rising objections to what for more than 50 years had been a 
bipartisan approach to free-trade agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said it is critical to resist pressures for new barriers  
at a time when the global economy is facing its worst crisis in 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	That 18-month-old crisis has plunged Russia and a number of  
Asian nations into deep recessions and caused the U.S. trade 
deficit to skyrocket to record levels as American exporters lose 
overseas markets and a flood of imports made cheaper by currency 
devaluations flood into America. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reduced access here could undermine the prospects of recovery  
and growth abroad in a world that is still working itself through 
the global crisis that began a year and a half ago, a recovery so 
important to our economic well-being,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the United States, with its very healthy economy, is seen  
as moving toward restricting markets, that could well increase the 
risks that the newly vibrant voices of protectionism in many 
countries around the world whose economies are struggling or less 
vibrant than ours,'' Rubin told the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	But underscoring the delicate balancing act the administration  
faces, Rubin said the administration was committed to helping 
sectors that have been hurt by globalization. Commerce Secretary 
William Daley, appearing with Rubin, said the administration is 
working to speed decisions on cases filed by the steel industry to 
impose penalty tariffs against a flood of cheaper foreign steel. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. trade deficit in 1998 rose to an all-time high of $153  
billion through the first 11 months of the year and private 
economists are expecting the deficit to rise by another $50 billion 
or more this year as American manufacturers and farmers continue to 
suffer from lost overseas markets. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said the  
administration is committed to pursuing an ``ambitious and 
far-reaching agenda'' in terms of trade. That is highlighted by an 
international conference the United States will host in late 
November to launch a new round of global trade talks among the 133 
nations that are members of the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	For the administration to complete those negotiations, it will  
need something that Congress for several years has refused to 
grant, new trade negotiating authority. While it has passed the 
Senate for the past two years, it has been blocked in the House, 
where labor unions and environmental groups have won the support of 
a majority of Democrats who have rejected the pleas of a Democratic 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. William Roth, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, said  
the hearings his committee will hold ``are of critical importance 
if we are going to adopt a bipartisan trade policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration will need fast-track approval to enter into  
the hard bargaining needed to conclude an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	This would be the ninth round of global trade talks, and  
Barshefsky said all the other discussions began without 
congressional approval of fast-track negotiating authority. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration announced on Monday that Seattle had won out  
over five other American cities to host the negotiations scheduled 
from Nov. 30 to Dec. 3. The other five cities in the running were 
Dallas, Detroit, Denver, San Diego and Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
	While Clinton had raised the prospect of new trade talks in a  
speech to the WTO last May in Geneva, the administration had until 
recently been split over just how broad those discussions should 
be, fearful that they could become bogged down as did the last 
round of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Those discussions, known as the Uruguay Round dragged on for  
nearly eight years from 1986 until 1994. The United States 
eventually agreed to the broader discussions favored by Europe and 
Japan after receiving assurances the talks cold be completed in 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The discussions will focus on lowering tariffs on manufactured  
goods and farm products as well as lowering other trade barriers 
covering trade in services such as banking and insurance and in 
increasing copyright and trade mark protections.

<HEADLINE> FDA To Restrict Animal Antibiotics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government wants to impose new  
restrictions on antibiotics for animals to combat concerns that 
on-the-farm medication is creating drug-resistant germs that could 
wind up in the meat that people eat. 
</P>
<P>
	Advisers to the Food and Drug Administration ruled Tuesday that  
the proposed rules need fine-tuning, but that most should go into 
effect despite protests from makers of animal drugs that the agency 
is drastically overreacting. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the rules would set pre-established terms  
for when an animal antibiotic has shown signs of enough drug 
resistance that its use should be curbed -- or banned altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an issue that won't go away and can no longer be  
ignored,'' said Dr. Keith Sterner, an Ionia, Mich., veterinarian 
who chairs the advisory panel. 
</P>
<P>
	But a two-day meeting to deliberate the FDA's proposals  
highlighted how bitter a controversy the issue is. 
</P>
<P>
	On one side, public health experts say on-the-farm drugs are  
worsening the already dire problem of antibiotics losing their 
power to fight infections. On the other side, the animal drug 
industry denies any serious risk to consumers, noting that no one 
has died from eating meat tainted with untreatable germs. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics ``never stood at the bedside of a critically ill patient  
... hoping the antibiotics will work and having to deal with the 
consequences when they don't,'' said Dr. David Bell of the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention. He pleaded with the industry to 
find a compromise that protects consumers while still giving 
farmers drugs vital for animal health. 
</P>
<P>
	But manufacturers adamantly opposed many of FDA's plans, saying  
the rules would make it too difficult -- and expensive -- to create 
new antibiotics for animals. They argued that the government 
instead should study whether on-the-farm antibiotics really pose an 
imminent threat and educate farmers and veterinarians to more 
prudently use the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the agency is overreacting,'' said Dr. Brendan Fox,  
president of Elanco Animal Health. 
</P>
<P>
	That prompted a fierce reaction from one of FDA's advisers: ``If  
there is no risk, you shouldn't be afraid of'' the rules, said 
CDC's Dr. Frederick Angulo. 
</P>
<P>
	Antibiotics are fast losing their power against numerous germs,  
which get a chance to mutate into untreatable strains every time 
they encounter the drugs. Most to blame are humans: Doctors who 
overprescribe antibiotics, and patients who take them improperly. 
</P>
<P>
	But many scientists say antibiotics on the farm are forcing  
food-borne germs to start mutating, too. Among the evidence: 
Chicken sold in Minnesota supermarkets contaminated with 
food-poisoning campylobacter that was resistant to one powerful 
antibiotic. In addition, a strain of salmonella impervious to five 
antibiotics nearly killed a Vermont dairy farmer. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost half the 50 million pounds of U.S.-produced antibiotics  
is used in animals. Eighty percent is used not to treat sick 
animals, but instead to promote animals' growth by adding small 
doses into their feed. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, Europe has drawn the ire of the animal health industry  
by banning six antibiotics used as animal growth promoters, 
including one closely related to the vital human antibiotic 
vancomycin. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the FDA's proposals to tackle the issue:  
</P>
<P>
	--Companies seeking to sell a new animal antibiotic would have to  
prove it's not expected to cause significant resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	--The government would test today's level of food-borne drug  
resistance, and then set limits on how much that resistance could 
increase before an animal antibiotic would be restricted or even 
banned. 
</P>
<P>
	--FDA would rank animal drugs, giving those most closely related  
to vital human antibiotics extra scrutiny. Some companies might be 
ordered to conduct on-the-farm animal tests. 
</P>
<P>
	FDA advisers say on-the-farm testing may be too complicated to  
work. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sterner said advisers agree with most of FDA's approach, and  
stressed that animal antibiotics closely related to vital human 
drugs would have ``a zero threshhold'' for increasing resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency will decide which rules to adopt after a public  
comment period ends in April.

<HEADLINE> Alton Maddox Refuses To Apologize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. (AP) -- A defiant Alton Maddox returned to the  
scene of the Tawana Brawley defamation trial, refusing to apologize 
for calling an opposing lawyer a ``bald-faced racist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maddox arrived at the Dutchess County courthouse Monday, the  
deadline for the apology ordered by Justice S. Barrett Hickman. 
Maddox was accompanied by the Rev. Al Sharpton, the activist who 
was one of his codefendants in the defamation trial presided over 
by Hickman. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a court brief, Maddox said an apology to William Stanton  
would be ``an act of treason to my Creator, my ancestors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maddox, a lawyer, has been suspended from practicing law since  
1990 for making outrageous statements and charges. His action 
Monday could result in his disbarment. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge's office said he had no comment Monday. The case will  
now be referred to another judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddox made the remarks to Stanton in response to what he said  
were insensitive comments. At the time, Stanton was representing 
Stephen Pagones, who sued Maddox, Sharpton and C. Vernon Mason for 
accusing him of raping Brawley, a 15-year-old black girl, in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Pagones won a $345,000 judgment in the defamation trial last  
summer. A grand jury had previously concluded Brawley's story of 
abduction and rape by a racist group of whites was a hoax, perhaps 
concocted to avoid punishment for staying out late. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanton said he doesn't care whether he ever receives an  
apology. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was never anticipating an apology, and as far as I'm  
concerned, the trial is over and I have to get onto my other 
clients,'' Stanton said. ``Unfortunately, (Maddox) has been 
suspended and he doesn't have any, so he has time to go to 
Poughkeepsie and perform his theatrics.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Urged To Call Witnesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In seeking testimony from Monica Lewinsky and  
others, House prosecutors hope to create momentum for their case 
and poke holes in President Clinton's defense. ``Look them in the 
eye,'' one prosecutor urged senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeing and hearing Ms. Lewinsky and other witnesses in person  
will help senators judge their credibility and resolve factual 
disputes, prosecutors told the Senate on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ms. Lewinsky would risk losing her immunity from prosecution  
if she changed her story during the impeachment trial and provided 
dramatic new information about her relationship with the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing they could get out of testimony by Monica  
Lewinsky would be large television ratings,'' said Georgetown law 
professor Louis Michael Seidman. That alone could help prosecutors, 
he added, because ``their only hope is to get people focused on it 
so that minds might change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Legal observers noted that the other witnesses sought by  
prosecutors -- presidential friend Vernon Jordan and White House 
aide Sidney Blumenthal -- are hostile to their case that the 
president broke the law in hiding his affair. Ms. Lewinsky's 
current views are not known, although she made a point of 
volunteering to a grand jury last summer that no one told her to 
lie or promised her a job in exchange for her denial of an affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors apparently are ``hoping that some of the witnesses  
such as Vernon Jordan would not be believed,'' said Northwestern 
University law professor Steven Lubet. 
</P>
<P>
	New York lawyer Bruce Yannett said the prosecutors might not get  
much new information, but ``by having live testimony (they could) 
create some momentum on their side and possibly rebut some specific 
factual points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a last-ditch, desperation move on their part,'' Yannett  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutor Bill McCollum, R-Fla., told senators that if  
Ms. Lewinsky testifies, ``she herself will convey this story to you 
in a way that it cannot be conveyed off a piece of paper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senators need to see how the witnesses respond to questioning,  
McCollum said, adding, ``Look them in the eye and make that 
determination yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., said Ms. Lewinsky could describe the  
``tone and tenor'' of her conversations with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The concealment of the gifts -- what really happened there? And  
the job search,'' he added. ``Wouldn't it be nice to hear Ms. 
Lewinsky's version of this?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors also want Ms. Lewinsky to testify about her  
discussions with Jordan about his efforts to help her find a job. 
They want Jordan to testify about when he knew the true nature of 
the relationship between Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	And they want to ask Blumenthal about his conversations with  
Clinton after the scandal broke publicly last January. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyer, David Kendall, said the prosecutors ``continue  
to hope that something will turn up for them.... They're simply 
gambling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors did not seek testimony from Clinton's private  
secretary, Betty Currie, who in December 1997 picked up from Ms. 
Lewinsky gifts that the president had given her. Ms. Lewinsky has 
testified that Mrs. Currie called her to arrange to pick up the 
gifts, while Mrs. Currie said she thought Ms. Lewinsky suggested 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Lubet, of Northwestern, said prosecutors might have decided not  
to seek Mrs. Currie's testimony because it could create doubt about 
the prosecution's case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Put the burden on the president to call her,'' Lubet said.  
``If the president calls her, the prosecution says, 'Believe 
Monica.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers hope she will not have to testify at all.  
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr promised her immunity from 
prosecution in exchange for her testimony, but he could seek to 
cancel the agreement if he believes she lied. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her entire immunity agreement is dependent on her having told  
the truth the first time,'' said lawyer Lawrence Fox of 
Philadelphia. ``Every time you open your mouth you put yourself at 
a little bit of risk.''

<HEADLINE> 3 Witnesses Picked in Clinton Case </HEADLINE>

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a surprise move, House prosecutors asked  
the Senate today to ``request the appearance'' of President Clinton 
at a deposition for his impeachment trial. They also sought 
subpoenas to question Monica Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon 
Jordan and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors made the request in a motion at the start of the  
trial today, substantially paring down their demand for live 
witnesses before a Senate deeply divided on the issue. The motion 
requested only that the witnesses be questioned at depositions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The two people who know the most about this are Monica  
Lewinsky and President William Jefferson Clinton,'' Rep. Bill 
McCollum said, opening the prosecutors' arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	``We strongly urge that if you allow us to have witnesses, which  
we believe you should ... call President Clinton here to testify,'' 
McCollum said. ``We think it is exceedingly important that you have 
an opportunity, we have an opportunity for you to examine him and 
these other witnesses to get at the truth of this matter and end 
all the speculation that has revolved around this matter and let 
you draw the proper inferences and conclusions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's spokesmen have said repeatedly that he will not  
testify. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was expected to vote by Wednesday on the witness  
question and a Democratic request to dismiss the case. The Senate's 
45 Democrats uniformly support dismissal and opposed calling 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said today there were enough  
GOP votes to defeat the dismissal motion and to give the 
prosecutors a limited number of witnesses. ``We made a mistake in 
not letting the House have a rebuttal,'' she said. ``The sentiment 
is that we need to let the House call witnesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Ms. Lewinsky left her Washington hotel today on her  
way out of town. She had returned over the weekend from California 
to interview with House prosecutors at the order of a federal 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her state of mind is she wants to get out of town and I  
endorse that,'' attorney Plato Cacheris said. ``She and I hope she 
will not have to testify. If she's needed, they issue a proper 
document to get her back here, she will return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The motion submitted by House prosecutors demanded subpoenas for  
Ms. Lewinsky and the two presidential advisers, but not Clinton. 
Instead, the motion said the prosecutors ``request the appearance 
of William Jefferson Clinton ... at a deposition for the purpose of 
providing testimony related to the impeachment trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, a longtime Clinton confidant and golfing partner, helped  
find Ms. Lewinsky a job around the time she had emerged as a 
subpoenaed figure in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case against 
Clinton. Jordan denies the job search and the lawsuit were 
connected. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal was one of the aides to whom Clinton first denied  
having a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky after the 
controversy erupted. He was later called as a grand jury witness 
and repeated Clinton's denial there, including that the president 
believed the former intern had stalked him. House prosecutors hope 
to show Clinton lied to his aides so they would pass on the false 
information to the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	The House prosecutors also asked permission to introduce three  
pieces of evidence that weren't in the official House impeachment 
record used so far during the trial: 
</P>
<P>
	--An affidavit from Barry Ward, the clerk for U.S. District Judge  
Susan Webber Wright who oversaw the Paula Jones sexual harassment 
lawsuit against the president. Prosecutors said Ward attended 
Clinton's deposition in the Jones case and observed a key moment in 
the testimony in which presidential lawyers contend Clinton was not 
paying attention. Ward testified the president was attentive, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	--An affidavit from T. Wesley Holmes, a lawyer for Mrs. Jones,  
who testified that the Jones lawyers had subpoenaed Oval Office 
secretary Betty Currie as a witness in their case in January 1998, 
around the time Clinton had summoned his secretary to his office 
and gone over his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Clinton has said 
he wasn't tampering with Ms. Currie because he had no reason to 
believe she would be a witness in any proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	--Records of telephone calls between Ms. Lewinsky and the  
president, including a Dec. 6, 1997, call that lasted 56 minutes. 
The call occurred around the time Ms. Lewinsky was emerging as a 
possible witness in the Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	With senators set to begin debate over witnesses, one Republican  
questioned the quality of the prosecution's overall case. ``If it 
were an airtight case ... you'd probably have about 70, 75 senators 
lining up to convict,'' said Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama. ``You 
don't see that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shelby said on NBC's ``Today'' that he is willing to listen to  
House prosecutors' arguments for witnesses even though they ``are 
hoping to find something rather than perhaps having something.'' 
But unless it can be shown that witnesses will change the dynamic 
of the trial, ``I say let's dispense with the witnesses and go on 
and vote the issue up or down after we have arguments,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Larry Craig of Idaho, a member of the GOP leadership, said  
if senators gave permission to the prosecutors to take depositions, 
they probably would be required to report back by Monday. ``There 
will be time limits, absolutely,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders are considering another option to outright  
acquittal or conviction and removal from office: find that Clinton 
committed perjury and obstruction of justice in connection with his 
affair with Ms. Lewinsky but not remove him. 
</P>
<P>
	That option by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, Republican officials  
said, is predicated on the widely held assumption that the 67 votes 
needed to convict and remove Clinton would never materialize. This 
way, Clinton would emerge from the trial formally acquitted of the 
impeachment charges but irrevocably tarnished -- and senators would 
be afforded some cover with constituents who believe action should 
be taken. 
</P>
<P>
	Reaction to the idea was split. Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., said  
today, ``It raises questions in my mind, constitutional questions 
and procedural questions.'' Democrats also questioned its 
constitutionality. 
</P>
<P>
	But Craig said, ``My first reaction is that it is worth  
pursuing.''

<HEADLINE> Infomercial Guru, Wife, Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- William J. McCorkle flashed a dimpled  
smile, a quick wink and a wave to a gallery of supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	It was that same grin that helped convince thousands of people  
McCorkle was sincere when he promised a real estate deal with no 
debts, lower taxes and early retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the exotic dancer turned infomercial maven wasn't  
wooing prospective customers. 
</P>
<P>
	McCorkle, 32, and his wife, Chantal, each were sentenced to more  
than 24 years in prison for fraud and money laundering stemming 
from a scheme worth more than $72 million in sales of videotapes, 
books and seminars promising a business partnership that would 
never exist. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of federal guidelines, their sentences were harsher than  
if they'd been found guilty of second-degree murder or raping a 
child. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge acknowledged that fact, but said she found no  
compelling reason to deviate from the guidelines established by 
Congress. The couple could have each received more than 31 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case is troubling. The defendants are young. They have no  
prior record of any consequence,'' U.S. District Judge Patricia 
Fawsett said. ``This is an extremely stiff sentence. It gives me 
great pause.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the 24-year, four-month sentences, McCorkle and  
Mrs. McCorkle, 30, were ordered to perform 50 hours of community 
service when they are released. 
</P>
<P>
	The boyish-looking McCorkle was a familiar face to viewers of  
late-night television. In 28-minute infomercials, he would talk 
enthusiastically about how he had gone from a poor child who was 
once evicted from his family's home to a real-estate millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
	With a near evangelistic zeal, he claimed he could help  
customers ``Pay off your debts, lower your taxes and retire in two 
years or less ...'' Viewers saw the fruits of his wealth: yacht, 
luxury home, helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
	McCorkle's companies sold videos and pamphlets that promised to  
teach customers how to make money on foreclosed real estate. 
Federal prosecutors said McCorkle misled customers and refused to 
issue refunds when they were dissatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said it has identified 1,124 people who put their  
faith in McCorkle, who four times failed an exam for his real 
estate license. Before starting his telemarketing businesses in 
1990, he worked as a busboy and exotic dancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of McCorkle's associates also were sentenced to five years  
each for fraud conspiracy.

<HEADLINE>  Hand Transplant Patient Doing Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Thirteen years after an explosive blew  
off his left hand, Matthew David Scott has a new one. 
</P>
<P>
	``He stares at it and grins,'' family friend James Brown said  
Monday as Scott, a paramedic from Absecon, N.J., recovered from the 
first hand transplant in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14 1/2-hour surgery ended early Monday at Jewish Hospital in  
Louisville. His doctors said Scott, 37, was doing as well as 
possible. They watched closely for blood clots, other complications 
and any sign that the donor hand was being rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't expect to see rejection in the early phase. Our big  
concern is in the first three months,'' said Dr. Jon William Jones 
Jr., an organ rejection expert who was part of the surgical team. 
</P>
<P>
	A hospital spokeswoman said today there were no blood clots or  
other complications overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is doing very well,'' Kim Freeman said. ``He's alert.  
Everything is progressing as expected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tiny pieces of skin from the hand will be microscopically  
examined every few days to see if lymphocytes -- tissue-killing 
cells -- are attacking it, Jones said. If so, Scott's medication 
could be adjusted. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott was being given powerful drugs that reduce the chances of  
rejection but pose significant dangers of their own. His suppressed 
immune system makes him vulnerable to infections that could be life 
threatening, said Jones and the lead surgeon, Dr. Warren 
Breidenbach. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott lost his dominant hand in a Dec. 23, 1985, blast from an  
M-80, which resembles a firecracker but is far more powerful. M-80s 
have been illegal in the United States since 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Courier-Journal before the surgery,  
Scott said the accident that cost him his hand came at a friend's 
house after a night of partying. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was 24,'' Scott said. ``It was Christmas. We were ... out at  
a club, laughing it up, having a good time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The firecracker was sitting out in the open. Scott said he  
``very foolishly'' picked it up, and, ``with a young man's 
bravado,'' touched his cigarette to the wick. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast from the M-80 tore most of his hand off, leaving parts  
of two fingers but little else. What remained was amputated above 
the wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott got a prosthetic hand and resumed working. In 1990, he was  
named National Paramedic of the Year by Emergency Medical Services 
magazine, said Tom Starr, director of the Mobile Intensive Care 
Unit at Virtua Health, where 
</P>
<P>
	Scott now oversees paramedic training in southern New Jersey. He  
also is assistant director of the School of Paramedic Science at 
Camden County College. 
</P>
<P>
	Some doctors have questioned the risks of transplanting a  
nonvital organ such as a hand. Breidenbach said Scott was chosen 
because he had not adapted well to his artificial hand and is 
intelligent, articulate and has support from his family, which 
includes his wife and two young sons. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott learned about the Louisville doctors' plans to attempt a  
hand transplant last summer, when his wife read a newspaper article 
while they were vacationing in London. He called the hospital hours 
after returning home. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview before his surgery, Scott said that with his  
artificial hand he lived in fear of going through buffet lines and 
handling food at parties. Nor was he able to show his sons how to 
play baseball, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always been the little things -- the daily little  
things,'' Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Scott can only hope to gain limited use of the  
transplanted hand -- able to pick up objects but unable to button 
his shirt, Breidenbach said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You should be able to get fairly good flexation and extension  
-- not complete -- and some sensation, but not normal,'' Breidenbach 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeons for years have been able to reattach severed limbs  
following accidents, but they had never been able to successfully 
transfer a limb from a dead donor to a living recipient. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, a hand transplant was performed in Lyon, France,  
on a New Zealand man who lost part of his right arm in a prison 
sawing accident in 1984. At least one attempt at a hand transplant 
occurred in South America in 1964, but the patient's body rejected 
the hand within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent surgery joined the cadaver hand a bit above  
wristwatch level with Scott's arm. The surgeons had to join the 
bones, clamping them together with metal plates and screws. Tendons 
were attached and gently tugged to make sure they would cause 
fingers to move. 
</P>
<P>
	Nerves were joined next, then arteries and veins. The hospital  
refused to disclose any information about the donor.

<P>
	A hospital spokeswoman said today there were no blood clots or  
other complications overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is doing very well,'' Kim Freeman said. ``He's alert.  
Everything is progressing as expected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tiny pieces of skin from the hand will be microscopically  
examined every few days to see if lymphocytes -- tissue-killing 
cells -- are attacking it, Jones said. If so, Scott's medication 
could be adjusted. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott was being given powerful drugs that reduce the chances of  
rejection but pose significant dangers of their own. His suppressed 
immune system makes him vulnerable to infections that could be life 
threatening, said Jones and the lead surgeon, Dr. Warren 
Breidenbach. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott lost his dominant hand in a Dec. 23, 1985, blast from an  
M-80, which resembles a firecracker but is far more powerful. M-80s 
have been illegal in the United States since 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Courier-Journal before the surgery,  
Scott said the accident that cost him his hand came at a friend's 
house after a night of partying. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was 24,'' Scott said. ``It was Christmas. We were ... out at  
a club, laughing it up, having a good time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The firecracker was sitting out in the open. Scott said he  
``very foolishly'' picked it up, and, ``with a young man's 
bravado,'' touched his cigarette to the wick. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast from the M-80 tore most of his hand off, leaving parts  
of two fingers but little else. What remained was amputated above 
the wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott got a prosthetic hand and resumed working. In 1990, he was  
named National Paramedic of the Year by Emergency Medical Services 
magazine, said Tom Starr, director of the Mobile Intensive Care 
Unit at Virtua Health, where 
</P>
<P>
	Scott now oversees paramedic training in southern New Jersey. He  
also is assistant director of the School of Paramedic Science at 
Camden County College. 
</P>
<P>
	Some doctors have questioned the risks of transplanting a  
nonvital organ such as a hand. Breidenbach said Scott was chosen 
because he had not adapted well to his artificial hand and is 
intelligent, articulate and has support from his family, which 
includes his wife and two young sons. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott learned about the Louisville doctors' plans to attempt a  
hand transplant last summer, when his wife read a newspaper article 
while they were vacationing in London. He called the hospital hours 
after returning home. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview before his surgery, Scott said that with his  
artificial hand he lived in fear of going through buffet lines and 
handling food at parties. Nor was he able to show his sons how to 
play baseball, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always been the little things -- the daily little  
things,'' Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Scott can only hope to gain limited use of the  
transplanted hand -- able to pick up objects but unable to button 
his shirt, Breidenbach said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You should be able to get fairly good flexation and extension  
-- not complete -- and some sensation, but not normal,'' Breidenbach 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeons for years have been able to reattach severed limbs  
following accidents, but they had never been able to successfully 
transfer a limb from a dead donor to a living recipient. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, a hand transplant was performed in Lyon, France,  
on a New Zealand man who lost part of his right arm in a prison 
sawing accident in 1984. At least one attempt at a hand transplant 
occurred in South America in 1964, but the patient's body rejected 
the hand within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent surgery joined the cadaver hand a bit above  
wristwatch level with Scott's arm. The surgeons had to join the 
bones, clamping them together with metal plates and screws. Tendons 
were attached and gently tugged to make sure they would cause 
fingers to move. 
</P>
<P>
	Nerves were joined next, then arteries and veins. The hospital  
refused to disclose any information about the donor.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Trial Highlights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Highlights from President Clinton's impeachment trial Tuesday:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The Senate heard arguments from both House managers and White  
House lawyers about the need to call witnesses. House managers said 
they could limit themselves to ``a pitiful three'' witnesses: 
Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan, and Sydney Blumenthal. The managers 
also signaled that they would invite President Clinton to testify 
if the motion passed. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Senate took up a motion, behind closed doors, to allow  
witnesses after rejecting an attempt by Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, to 
open the debate to the public. Debate on Monday's motion to dismiss 
also took place privately when a similar motion by Harkin failed. 
</P>
<P>
	-- President Clinton spent most of the day in St. Louis, where  
Pope John Paul II is visiting. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said that the votes on two  
critical motions -- one to dismiss and the other on whether to call 
witnesses -- would take place as soon as the Senate began 
deliberations at 1 p.m. Wednesday. Republicans said they had the 
votes necessary to defeat the motion to dismiss and pass the motion 
for witnesses.

<HEADLINE>  Falcons' Mathis Opens Up His Soul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Terance Mathis is using the Super Bowl to cleanse  
his heart and his soul. 
</P>
<P>
	In the space of a few days, Mathis admitted to having an alcohol  
problem -- though he still drinks occasionally -- and complained 
about having to wait to get off the team's chartered jet when it 
landed in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	He also revealed Tuesday that he considered retirement after the  
1996 season because he was perturbed the Falcons' jet almost took 
off without him on its way to the final game in Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't know me, get to know me,'' the 31-year-old  
Falcons receiver said. ``This is the first opportunity in my career 
where I can speak about Terance Mathis and not be asked about Jamal 
Anderson or Chris Chandler or the defense or Dan Reeves. I had an 
opportunity ... to speak about Terance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mathis said he felt a desire to talk about his drinking problem  
during Super Bowl week because he felt guilty about receiving so 
much publicity for his community service in Atlanta and other 
cities. The T.L.C. (Terance Loves Children) foundation provides 
food, clothing and shelter to disadvantaged children. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was something that's been weighing on my heart,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathis said he realized his drinking was out of control because  
of several near-misses while behind the wheel of his car. His 
reasons for turning to alcohol were more muddled. 
</P>
<P>
	He indicated he turned to the bottle when he wasn't fully  
appreciated for a 111-catch, Pro Bowl season in 1994. But he also 
pointed to alcohol as the reason his numbers dipped after that 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``My responsibility to the youth is to try to be the best I can  
be, not only on the field but off the field,'' he said. ``If I'm 
going to talk to you about not doing drugs and drinking and 
driving, I've got to live that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mathis said his drinking is now ``very, very under control,''  
though he still consumes alcohol in moderate portions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a beer or two in the last couple of days,'' he said.  
``But (Monday) was a very, very good day for me. I did not have a 
drink or have a desire to have a drink. I don't think I'm going to 
have that craving anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mathis said he considered retirement after the Falcons went 3-13  
in 1996. He was angry when he nearly missed the team plane, bound 
for the final game in Jacksonville, and he was irritated when he 
didn't catch a pass in the 19-17 loss to the Jaguars. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a couple of minutes late and I could see them closing  
the doors, about to leave without me,'' he said. ``I couldn't 
believe that. Then we get to the game and I didn't catch a ball. I 
was a little hurt. Maybe I took it too personal, but I was hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to the team in '97, struggling at first to adapt to  
the run-oriented offense installed by new coach Dan Reeves. But he 
thrived this season with 64 receptions for 1,136 yards and 11 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathis credits his wife of 18 months, Arnedia, with pulling him  
out of his funk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ever since my wife has come into my life, I have been truly  
blessed,'' he said. ``If I'm going to grow in my faith, I'm going 
to have to let some of those demons out of the closet to clear my 
heart. I have done that. I feel very good about that. I'm at peace 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't at peace Sunday, complaining publicly when Reeves  
allowed the Pro Bowlers and 10-year veterans to debark first when 
the team plane landed in Miami. Mathis is a Pro Bowl alternate who 
has been in the NFL for nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of his teammates rolled their eyes when told of his  
complaints. Mathis said Tuesday it's no longer an issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to apologize for it because it wasn't an attempt  
to separate myself from the team or my teammates to separate 
themselves from me,'' he said. ``We're mature enough to let that be 
and go on with the rest of the week.''

<HEADLINE> No Prediction From Bradshaw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Terry Bradshaw had an answer for every question  
except who's going to win the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	He likes Denver and Atlanta. What he's not wild about is the  
hoopla surrounding this or any of the other NFL championship games 
he's been involved with as a player and broadcaster. 
</P>
<P>
	If he wasn't working, he'd just as soon be at home relaxing with  
his family this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like Super Bowls,'' he said Tuesday. ``But make no  
mistake, I love my job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Fox television studio co-host led the Pittsburgh Steelers to  
four Super Bowl titles in the 1970s and will be working his fifth 
as a pregame analyst on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Think that might make him a Super Bowl junkie of sorts? No way.  
</P>
<P>
	The Hall of Fame quarterback doesn't revel in the hype  
surrounding the game and isn't into the party scene, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he answered questions about himself, football and his  
job for more than an hour, he plans to stay out of the spotlight 
for the remainder of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll read, play cards and golf,'' Bradshaw said. ``I've done  
all my preparation. I've done all my interviews.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For its coverage of the Falcons-Broncos game, Fox will use a  
Super Bowl-record 31 cameras, 25 video tape replay machines, six 
video tape machines with slow-motion capabilities and a blimp. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's telecast, with the broadcast team of Pat Summerall and  
John Madden working their seventh Super Bowl together, will be 
beamed to more than 100 countries and military installations around 
the world. In the United States alone, an estimated 133.4 million 
viewers watched last year's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradshaw caused a stir nine years ago when, annoyed that he was  
in New Orleans for an appearance during Super Bowl week, criticized 
John Elway and told reporters he thought Denver would lose 55-3 to 
the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he said he was convinced the 49ers were a better team  
and would win easily, he predicted such a lopsided score because he 
was angry about having to stop in town on his way to San Antonio to 
give a speech. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't until he returned home a few days later that he  
realized he had created a furor. Letters and messages poured into 
his office, and CBS responded by sending him back to New Orleans to 
-- of all things -- try to interview Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't get the interview, the 49ers won 55-10 and time has  
healed his relationship with the Broncos quarterback, who won a 
Super Bowl in his fourth try last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody changes. I said some things that weren't nice, and  
at the time I believed them,'' Bradshaw said. ``I don't feel the 
same way (now).'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also doesn't have a prediction for Sunday's game. He may save  
that for the pregame show, which will begin at 11 a.m. EST -- more 
than seven hours before kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, he had a hunch that Atlanta was going to upset  
Minnesota in the NFC Championship game, but didn't go with it on 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Knowing there was a possibility he'd have to the face the  
Vikings in the locker room and hear from fans leaving the 
Metrodome, he predicted a victory for the home team. 
</P>
<P>
	He should have trusted his gut.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't stick to it. I couldn't believe myself,'' he said.  
``But I won't switch this time.''

<HEADLINE> Poor Countries Unprepared for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most poor countries are unprepared for  
potential Year 2000 computer problems, raising concern they might 
have trouble obtaining food, health care and electricity, the World 
Bank said in a report Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of preparation is most acute in sub-Sahara Africa, but  
countries in Asia, Latin America and the former Soviet Union also 
could be hard hit, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no consensus on how bad the Year 2000 problem will be  
or how much it will cost to fix,'' said Joyce Amenta, the bank's 
leading Y2K specialist. ``What we do know is that most developing 
countries are unprepared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bank officials said that at the World Economic Forum in Davos,  
Switzerland, next Monday, they and U.S. representatives will call 
for increased international cooperation to deal with the problem, 
including money to support a Y2K International Cooperation Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, the World Bank has lent $30 million to Argentina for  
Y2K preparation and approved $29 million for Sri Lanka last week. 
Other loans are under consideration, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-tech threat could occur if computers fail when the date  
changes to 2000 next Jan. 1. Because they were written to recognize 
only the last two digits of a year, such programs could read the 
digits ``00'' as 1900 instead of 2000. The computers could 
malfunction or shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	No one really knows what will happen at the century's end and  
predictions vary wildly, from electrical outages to financial 
instability to civil disorder. Maritime shipping, air 
transportation, oil supplies and other sectors of world trade could 
be disrupted. 
</P>
<P>
	Global estimates for fixing the problem run as high as $600  
billion, according to the Gartner Group, a technology research 
firm, not including potential lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Amenta said a World Bank survey of 139 developing countries  
showed that only 15 percent are taking concrete steps to fix the 
problem, 24 percent were aware of the problem but are not taking 
action and 38 percent have appointed a Y2K coordinator, but this is 
not a measure of readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	``The daily survival faced by developing countries have  
distracted governments from fixing the Y2K problem,'' Ms. Amenta 
said at a news conference. ``To them the problem is seen as a vague 
and distant threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Hugh Sloan, a bank information technology specialist for Africa  
said there was a false impression that the Y2K bug is much more of 
a problem in industrial countries and that the low level of 
automation in developing countries may immunize them against Y2K 
problems 
</P>
<P>
	``But actually, the impact could in fact be greater because the  
developing countries are more dependent on fewer and older 
computing systems and they have many more competing national 
demands for scarce resources,'' Sloan said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Africa, where the World Bank has been holding Y2K  
awareness-raising seminars, Sloan said the problem could disrupt 
extensive regional cooperative efforts such as provision of 
electric power.

<HEADLINE> Critics Bypass Tom Wolfe for Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Here's another literary prize Tom Wolfe will not  
win. 
</P>
<P>
	The best-selling author, whose novel ``A Man in Full'' was a  
runner-up last fall for the National Book Award, is not even a 
finalist for the National Book Critics Circle fiction prize. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was less discussion about it than you might expect,''  
said Barbara Hoffert, president of the NBCC, which announced the 
nominees Monday. ``We reached a consensus fairly quickly this 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A Man in Full,'' one of last year's most talked-about works of  
fiction, was never a favorite with critics. Instead, the NBCC chose 
writers much less famous but whose work received more consistent 
reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Finalists include two acclaimed short story writers: Lorrie  
Moore, for ``Birds of America,'' and the Canadian author Alice 
Munro, for ``The Love of a Good Woman.'' Also cited were three 
novelists: Michael Cunningham, for ``The Hours,'' David Gates, for 
``Preston Falls,'' and Lynne Tillman, for ``No Lease on Life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other prominent authors not nominated include National Book  
Award winner Alice McDermott, whose novel ``Charming Billy'' has 
been a surprise best seller, and Robert Stone, whose ``Damascus 
Gate'' was also a National Book Award runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBCC did cite at least one well known writer: Poet Laureate  
Robert Pinsky is among the finalists in the criticism category, 
cited for ``The Sounds of Poetry.'' David Remnick, who last year 
succeeded Tina Brown as editor of The New Yorker, was nominated in 
the biography/autobiography category for his book on Muhammad Ali, 
``King of the World.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winners will be announced March 8; there is no cash prize for  
awards. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Book Critics Circle, founded in 1974, is a  
not-for-profit organization of book editors and critics with 400 
members nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Can Plants, Animals Live in Space? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Sometime in the next century humans may  
colonize the moon or Mars and researchers are looking for the 
plants and animals that those settlers from Earth will take with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a long-term habitation of Mars, you'll have to grow crops,  
deal with microbes and so forth,'' David Morrison of NASA's Ames 
Research Center said Monday. ``We have to understand the response 
of those organisms to the different conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Organisms that evolved in the gravity of Earth may not thrive in  
the lighter gravity of the moon or Mars, said NASA's Emily R. 
Morey-Holton. In the one-sixth gravity of the moon and the 
one-third gravity of Mars, there are changes in the fundamental 
processes of heat convection and sedimentation. Also, the surface 
tension of water, which shatters easily in Earth's gravity, becomes 
a strong barrier in lighter gravity and could affect basic 
biological functions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know the effect of these changes,'' Morey-Holton said  
at the national meeting of the American Association for the 
Advancement of Science. ``We have to learn if Earth organisms can 
live and evolve in these changed conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, Morey-Holton said, researchers found that tadpoles  
hatched in orbit never developed lungs. In the low gravity, the 
surface tension on air bubbles became so strong that the tadpoles 
could not punch through to breathe, she said. ``They would hit the 
bubbles and just bounce off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another orbital experiment, a type of mustard plant failed to  
thrive in space because water droplets clustered about the roots, 
blocking absorption of nutrients. Again, the cause is thought to be 
the enhanced surface tension of the water droplets. 
</P>
<P>
	Changes in gravity could also affect how genes work and could  
even affect evolution, Morey-Holton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some researchers are looking for gravity-dependent genes,''  
she said. ``There is concern that in a different gravity some genes 
may fail to turn on while others could shut down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such actions could dramatically alter a plant or animal or even  
cause lethal changes, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In one orbital experiment, several generations of human kidney  
cells were cultured and researchers have found that the genes in 
the space grown cells changed. Just how the changes would affect 
the cells is not known. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we find gravity-sensitive genes, there is no reason why we  
can't have designer organisms that would be viable in the new 
environment,'' said Morey-Holton. In effect, Earth plants or 
animals could be genetically altered so they would thrive in the 
changed conditions of Mars and would then be put on board a 
space-age ark that would carry colonists to the Red Planet. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is planning a  
series of experiments on the International Space Station to find 
Earth organisms best suited for Mars. Plants and animals will be 
grown through several generations and then analyzed for genetic 
changes, Morrison said.

<HEADLINE> US: Missile Attacks Affecting Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A string of almost daily U.S. missile strikes  
on Iraq's extensive air defenses is having a ``grave impact'' on 
President Saddam Hussein's ability to challenge allied enforcement 
of a flight ban in northern and southern Iraq, U.S. officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon acknowledged, however, that a U.S. missile fired  
Monday at air defense targets near the city of Basra missed by 
miles and struck a residential area, where Iraq reported that five 
civilians were killed, 42 were injured and homes were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials declined to say what caused the missile to go  
astray. 
</P>
<P>
	``It created some damage,'' spokesman Kenneth Bacon said  
Tuesday, referring to the errant AGM-130 missile launched from an 
Air Force F-15E strike aircraft. ``We realize that and we regret 
any civilian casualties. But this was done in response to a 
provocative attack against our planes by Saddam Hussein.'' Bacon 
said he could not confirm the missile killed civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I have any independent confirmation whether it  
did or it didn't,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Air Force will continue using the AGM-130 in  
``no-fly'' zone enforcement missions in Iraq, Bacon said. He 
described the weapon as ``generally very accurate'' but said there 
are many reasons it might miss a target. He would not offer any 
examples. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the errant missile, American planes patrolling the  
no-fly zones will continue firing on Iraqi air defense radars, 
surface-to-air missile batteries and associated communications 
sites as long as Saddam keeps trying to shoot down American pilots, 
Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that we are having a grave impact on the Iraqi air  
defense system, and a grave impact on the number of weapons they 
have to bring to bear against our planes, and we will continue to 
do that until the threat goes away,'' Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The errant AGM-130 missile landed in the al-Jumhuriya  
neighborhood outside Basra, a port city in southern Iraq where U.S. 
planes have attacked air defenses almost daily this month in 
response to increased Iraqi challenges to enforcement of a no-fly 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters who visited the al-Jumhuriya neighborhood Monday said  
four homes were destroyed and six were damaged. Iraq reported an 
unspecified number of casualties there; it said a total of three 
American missiles killed 11 civilians in a series of attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said only one U.S. missile went astray.  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have any independent estimate of casualties or  
fatalities that can back up what the Iraqis have said about this,'' 
Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The AGM-130, the Air Force missile that missed its target Monday  
in Iraq, is a newly modified weapon with a 2,000-pound, 
high-explosive warhead. It is equipped with a guidance system that 
enables the crew of the launching aircraft to watch the missile's 
path on a television monitor and steer it to its target. It also 
can be used with automatic weapon guidance. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related development, Bacon and other administration  
officials acknowledged Tuesday that American warplanes patrolling 
the skies over northern and southern Iraq are operating under new 
guidance that authorizes more aggressive action against Iraqi air 
defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're acting here in self-defense and in response to concerted  
attacks by Saddam Hussein,'' Sandy Berger, the president's national 
security adviser, said in an interview with defense reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said Monday's attacks illustrated the more aggressive  
approach that U.S. military commanders requested and President 
Clinton approved after the four-day bombing campaign by U.S. and 
British planes in mid-December that marked a turning point in the 
Iraqi conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, the Pentagon had denied there was any change in  
approach.

<HEADLINE> Golf Exhibitors Keep Eye on Ball  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Perhaps there should be a sign stationed in front of the PGA  
Merchandise Show: Have a ball. 
</P>
<P>
	That won't be a problem this week at the 46th annual golf  
exposition, and not just because a record 1,400 exhibitors are 
expected to occupy 1.1 million square feet inside the Orange County 
Convention Center in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``This show definitely will be ball-dominated,'' said Tamara  
McCartney of Maxfli. ``There will be some new equipment launches 
for sure, but none of them seem to be taking on the kind of 
excitement of the balls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $650 million golf ball industry is already so crowded that  
1,918 kinds of balls were submitted last year to the USGA, all of 
them contained in an 84-page booklet. Earlier this month, 624 balls 
were submitted, a slight increase from last year and a sign the 
numbers will keep rising. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes this year particularly intriguing are the newcomers  
to an already saturated market -- Taylor Made, which has a material 
first used in ski boots, and Nike, which is intent on making a 
splash with its swoosh. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taylor Made Inergel, introduced after about 10 years of  
research and development, is made with an exclusive copolymer that 
is both soft and resilient, combining the distance of a hard ball 
with the control and feel of a balata. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor Made has remained mostly mum about its ball, although it  
made note of the fact Lee Janzen had a dozen stolen from his locker 
in the season-opening Mercedes Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels lighter off the club face,'' Janzen said. ``When I  
first started hitting it, I was waiting to see if there was 
anything possibly different that I had to adjust do, but I don't 
think I had to make the slightest adjustment'' from Precept's Tour 
Double Cover. 
</P>
<P>
	John Cook has also signed a contract to play the ball, and Steve  
Jones was using it at the Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike is moving from apparel to equipment by introducing four  
balls to accommodate golfers of various skill levels -- Tour 
Control, Spin Control, Distance Control and Distance. Mike Brisky 
and rookie Chris Couch were among an estimated half dozen who used 
the new Nike ball at the Sony Open in Honolulu two weeks ago. Couch 
said his three-piece model performs similarly to the Maxfli 
Revolution in terms of distance, spin and feel. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of pouring money into research like Taylor Made, Nike  
decided to farm that out to an existing ball manufacturer -- 
reportedly Bridgestone -- to contain costs. Still, product marketing 
manager Brian Zappitello said that doesn't mean its commitment is 
fleeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we weren't committed, we would have made 15-ball packs and  
sold them at big-box accounts,'' he told Golfweek magazine. ``We're 
making serious products for the traditional golfer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Callaway Golf also is investing big in the ball, although that  
won't be evident in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	After mulling whether it should have another company make its  
ball (like Nike) or buy an existing plant (Taylor Made), Callaway 
decided to start from scratch. The development of the Callaway ball 
is on schedule, meaning it should be ready to launch by this time 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	But is there room in an already crowded market for even more  
balls? 
</P>
<P>
	``When we entered the golf club business in 1988, certainly  
there wasn't anybody saying that we need a big supplier of golf 
clubs -- at least I didn't hear anybody say it,'' said founder and 
chairman Ely Callaway. ``The thing that made us grow was 
distinctive and superior golf products. We have to do the same 
thing with the golf balls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's true for Taylor Made and Nike. And they can be sure that  
the six major ball companies won't sit back and watch. 
</P>
<P>
	--Titleist, the No. 1 ball manufacturer, has come up with Tour  
Prestige as a high-performance companion to the Professional and 
Tour Balata. Jeff Sluman and Billy Andrade won with it in 
consecutive weeks last September, before it even had a name. 
</P>
<P>
	--Spalding, which has gotten great mileage from the Strata ball  
that Mark O'Meara began promoting three years ago, plans to 
introduce a new product Friday. Company officials have not given 
any hints what it might be. 
</P>
<P>
	--Wilson won't introduce a new product, like the Straight  
Distance it unveiled in September, but instead plans to build its 
campaign around the Staff Titanium line. 
</P>
<P>
	--Maxfli has the new XS Tour, which has a core made of nearly  
pure rubber and replaces the ball made popular by Greg Norman and 
John Huston. The Maxfli HT also is being upgraded with an improved 
urethane cover. Dunlop will introduce the Distance Precision, a 
two-piece ball in which the weight is shifted from the core to the 
cover, and Double Titanium Distance, which features titanium in the 
cover and the core. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Bridgestone doesn't plan to introduce new products from the  
Precept line at the show, although it will move into the value 
market with its new Rextar brand, which will be sold in four-ball 
sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
	--Slazenger will have the 408dr Raw-Distance 3, featuring  
dual-radium dimples to keep the trajectory low and the velocity 
high, and the 420s Select, a three-piece wound ball with a 
liquid-filled, rubber center.

<HEADLINE> Texas Executes Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A longtime criminal who admitted  
killing a man so he could marry his wife and collect part of his 
life insurance was executed by injection Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Vega, 52, beat James William Mims and shot him eight  
times in July 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the killing, Vega was under state supervision  
after serving only one week of a two-year sentence for aggravated 
robbery. That conviction came after terms for burglary and drug 
dealing, and prosecutors also determined Vega was responsible for a 
murder near St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Mims' murder went unsolved for 2 1/2 years before Vega walked into  
the police department in Luling, 50 miles east of San Antonio, and 
confessed that he plotted to kill him for $30,000 of Mims' $150,000 
life insurance policy. Vega also led authorities to the gun. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something must have gotten into him,'' prosecutor Jeff Van  
Horn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vega said Mims' wife, whom he eventually married, encouraged the  
murder so she could pocket the remainder of the payoff. 
Prosecutors, however, never were able to corroborate his claims and 
the woman never was charged. 
</P>
<P>
	In a rambling final statement, Vega proclaimed his innocence and  
called the legal system a ``very high-priced prostitute that sells 
justice to the highest bidder.''

<HEADLINE> Swedish Olympic Head Denies Payoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- The head of Stockholm's bid for the  
2004 Olympics denied a report that he made an offer to an agent who 
reportedly bought International Olympic Committee votes in the Salt 
Lake City scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The agent, Mahmoud el-Farnawani, was quoted today by the Swedish  
newspaper Dagens Nyheter as denying a report in Monday's Wall 
Street Journal that quoted him as saying Stockholm bid chief Olof 
Stenhammar ``made this big offer ... it would be shameful for the 
Swedish people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a prepared statement, Stenhammar said today that he met  
Farnawani only once and ``the accusation -- if it has been made -- is 
completely false with no connection to reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a discussion on the IOC and the bidding process, of  
which he had experience from earlier bid. I was never offered any 
services related to the question and I did not offer or in any way 
ask for any,'' Stenhammar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the Wall Street Journal report, Farnawani told  
Dagens Nyheter that, ``What's in there isn't correct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I made it clear for (Stenhammar) that I did not want to work  
for Stockholm because I had earlier been involved in the competitor 
city Istanbul's candidacy. I was very disappointed when Stockholm 
and not Istanbul got a place in the final round of voting.''

<HEADLINE> 2 Airline Mechanics Under Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- At least two Alaska Airlines employees could lose  
their mechanics' licenses in connection with a federal criminal 
investigation into the carrier's alleged maintenance 
irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration has sent official notices  
informing a small number of maintenance workers they are under 
scrutiny and warning of possible sanctions, Lou Cancelmi, spokesman 
for the Seattle-based airline, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he did not know the exact number, their job titles or  
the allegations outlined in the notices. 
</P>
<P>
	DeWitte Lawson, general counsel of the FAA's western Pacific  
regional headquarters in Los Angeles, said he was told the inquiry 
involved ``a couple of mechanics'' in Oakland, Calif., who are 
``suspected of falsifying some documents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawson said the results of the investigation and a recommended  
action could be forwarded to his office, which has the power to 
revoke or suspend mechanic licenses or impose a fine. It could also 
not take any action. 
</P>
<P>
	A revocation of a mechanic license, or certificate, is rare and  
is ``as serious as we can get,'' said John Hubbard, an FAA official 
in Seattle and principal maintenance inspector overseeing Alaska 
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	A grand jury investigation is being conducted by the U.S.  
Attorney's Office in Oakland and the federal Department of 
Transportation. The jury is examining allegations that maintenance 
and repair work was recorded as having been done when it was not. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agents searched company facilities in Oakland and  
Seattle late last month, seizing maintenance records relating to 
three of the airline's 40 MD-80 jetliners. 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska Airlines officials have said that while the FAA has  
assured them the inquiry is not related to air safety or 
airworthiness, they have not been told the specific nature of the 
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Posts $465 M Qtr Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Boeing Co. posted a $465 million profit in  
its fourth quarter, reversing a loss from a year ago and beating 
Wall Street's estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	The huge aircraft manufacturer earned 48 cents a share for the  
October-December period in contrast to a loss of $498 million, or 
51 cents a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. expected Boeing would earn  
about 42 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 loss reflected a special charge of $876 million for  
commercial aircraft product lines of the former McDonnell Douglas 
Corp., which Boeing acquired that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to $17.1 billion, up 46 percent from $11.7 billion  
in fourth-quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Boeing earned $1.1 billion or $1.15 a share, on  
revenue of $56.2 billion, compared with a loss of $178 million, or 
18 cents a share, on revenue of $45.8 billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The company delivered 559 commercial jetliners in 1998 versus  
374 a year earlier, but the company was still feeling the effects 
of the Asian financial crisis. Some aircraft delivered in late 1998 
were under short-term operating leases. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing said commercial aircraft revenues for the year were $35.5  
billion, up $8.6 billion from 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But operating margins on commercial jets were 4 percent for the  
year, down from 5 percent in 1997, because of pricing pressures and 
the mix of aircraft delivered. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing is delivering more 777 and new-generation 737 models, and  
newer programs that have higher production costs. The new 737 
models have yet to turn a profit. 
</P>
<P>
	The company warned that the same pressures will continue to  
affect operating margins in 1999, when the company expects to 
deliver 620 aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	For 2000, Boeing forecasts delivering about 480 commercial jets,  
with total company revenues of about $49 billion. Orders have 
slowed dramatically over the past year, due in great part to the 
financial uncertainty in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Condit, Boeing chairman and chief executive, said the  
company continues to make progress in improving its production. 
Problems with parts shortages, snarled assembly lines, delays in 
new programs and other production woes in 1997 cost the company 
billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from information, space and defense systems totaled  
$19.9 billion in 1998, $1.8 billion higher than in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Look at Three Potential Witnesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Forced to narrow their list of potential witnesses, the House  
members prosecuting President Clinton settled on three of the most 
intriguing personalities in the scandal: 
</P>
<P>
                         *SIDNEY BLUMENTHAL   	
</P>
<P>
	A friend of Hillary Rodham Clinton, Blumenthal has been a  
favorite target of conservatives since he abandoned journalism to 
join the president's staff in 1997. Critics say he peddles rumors 
about political opponents. He denies the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	The House trial managers are particularly interested in  
Blumenthal's conversation with the president, soon after the 
scandal broke publicly, in which Monica Lewinsky was referred to as 
a ``stalker'' who pursued the president sexually. Blumenthal 
testified Clinton told him he had rebuffed Ms. Lewinsky's advances 
but she had threatened to falsely tell people there was an affair 
anyway, so she ``wouldn't be the stalker anymore.'' The House 
managers say Clinton was trying to feed false information to the 
grand jury through Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
                           *VERNON JORDAN   	
</P>
<P>
	Stately, wealthy and discreetly powerful, Jordan handles many  
sensitive matters for his close friend, the president. House 
prosecutors are especially interested in one of those missions -- 
Jordan's efforts to help Ms. Lewinsky land a job just as she was 
preparing to deny an affair with Clinton in a false affidavit. He 
also took her to the lawyer who drew up the affidavit. Jordan has 
acknowledged helping Ms. Lewinsky, saying he aids many young 
people, but denied that his efforts were meant to buy her silence. 
Jordan was a civil rights leader before he joined one of 
Washington's most prominent law firms. As a witness, he would 
probably be intensely sympathetic to the president. 
</P>
<P>
                          *MONICA LEWINSKY   	
</P>
<P>
	She is the prosecutors' wild card -- the only one of the three  
who is no longer a close ally of the president. Ms. Lewinsky could 
shed new light on the effort to hide gifts Clinton gave her, why 
she decided to lie about their affair and how much the president 
knew about her false affidavit in the Paula Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the woman at the heart of the scandal has been heard  
only on Linda Tripp's secret tape recordings, and mostly viewed 
darting in and out of the courthouse or her lawyers' offices. Even 
if she says nothing new, a credible appearance by Ms. Lewinsky 
could cast more doubt on aspects of the president's testimony that 
conflict with her story. House managers promised not to delve into 
one area of conflict -- the details of their sexual encounters.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Exec Denies Making Remark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The most senior Microsoft executive who will  
testify at his company's antitrust trial denied to the government 
that he ever uttered an often-quoted phrase about his company's 
aggression toward a rival, that he once promised to ``cut off 
Netscape's air supply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sensational phrase, which underscores the government's  
antitrust case against Microsoft, was attributed by one witness to 
Paul Maritz during a November 1995 meeting with Intel Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its lawsuit, the government alleges that Microsoft  
included Internet browser software free within its dominant Windows 
operating system to try to ``crush'' Netscape, whose browser was 
much more popular during the mid-1990s and earned tens of millions 
of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	In a charge central to its case, the government contends that by  
flooding the market with its own free browser, Microsoft cut off 
Netscape's opportunity to earn profits on its software. 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz, though, flatly denied making the statements in written  
testimony submitted to the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never said, in the presence of Intel personnel or otherwise,  
that Microsoft would 'cut off Netscape's air supply,' or words to 
that effect,'' Maritz wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	But Justice Department lawyer David Boies confronted Maritz on  
Monday with his sworn statements from last year. Boies said they 
represent a far less adamant denial than Maritz's current 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's possible, but I just don't recall it,'' Maritz offered  
during earlier interviews with government lawyers. ``I don't 
believe it's something that I would have said.'' He added that he 
``would be skeptical'' if anyone attributed the comments directly 
to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning by Boies, Maritz said he recently reviewed the  
notes of three Intel executives at the 1995 meeting who did not 
remember the phrase. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe my testimony to be inconsistent then with what  
I am saying now,'' Maritz said calmly. 
</P>
<P>
	Another witness, Intel Vice President Steven McGeady, testified  
previously during the trial that Maritz and others from Microsoft 
met with executives in Oregon to discuss technology issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paul and some of the other attendees made some fairly colorful  
statements that stick out in my memory,'' McGeady testified. ``... 
It was Microsoft's plan to cut off Netscape's air supply. By giving 
away free browsers, Microsoft was going to keep Netscape from 
getting off the ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boies quizzed Maritz on Monday about whether he ever complained  
to The New York Times, which ran a story in January 1998 based on 
an anonymous interview with McGeady attributing the phrase to 
Maritz. 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz answered: ``Not to my knowledge.'' But he added that he  
was never named in the Times story and that, ``for a long time, it 
wasn't clear who at Microsoft would have said that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Times story clearly names Maritz, and Microsoft  
spokesman Mark Murray said later outside court that the company 
called to complain after the article was published. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft attorneys earlier confronted McGeady with his own  
notes about the disputed November 1995 meeting, which don't mention 
Maritz's alleged ``air supply'' comment. They also produced notes 
from two other Intel executives, who also didn't include it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The phrase was so far out of bounds with what I consider to be  
an acceptable business practice,'' McGeady testified. ``It stuck 
out clearly in my mind.'' 
</P>

Microsoft's most important products, including its dominant Windows 
operating system and its profitable Office software programs.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Reflects on Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sure that the answers lie deeper than the Y2K  
bug or endless New Year's toasts, President Clinton welcomed 
scholars to the White House to ponder the significance of the 
fast-approaching new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	The East Room event Monday night began not with a forecast into  
the future, but with a look back at the first millennium event 1000 
years ago and how it was received by the Western world at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the lessons of the last millennium are evidence  
that ``ordinary people, even a long time ago, can make a difference 
toward a good end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the stories of people at the dawn of this millennium, ``we  
hear our own fears and hopes that what we do will matter today and 
tomorrow,'' first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton told an audience that 
included some of the nation's foremost theologians and scholars of 
medieval history. 
</P>
<P>
	Professor Natalie Zemon Davis, a specialist on the culture of  
early modern Europe, captured the mood of the first millennium, 
which she said spread over several decades before and after the 
actual event. While the period around 1000 A.D. prompted many 
doomsayers to predict the apocalypse, it also inspired some 
movements toward peace and social change. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our dreammaking capacity, our capacity to imagine, can give  
birth to the good as well as the bad,'' said Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the lessons of the last millennium are evidence  
that ``ordinary people, even a long time ago, can make a difference 
toward a good end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaping centuries ahead, Professor Martin E. Marty, one of the  
leading interpreters of American religion, discussed how the fast 
approaching 2000 will impact humanity. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be seeking meaning with new intensity at this time,''  
said Marty, who now directs the Public Religion Project at the 
University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Marty said some people will still have apocalyptic visions, both  
religious and secular, with people fearing complete chaos caused by 
such phenomena as the millennium bug. Others will see the 
millennium as time for progressive change, engaging in ``realistic 
hope'' for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said this hope exists despite the certainty of  
human beings ``making the same old mistakes over and over again, 
millennium after millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You all know I am a walking apostle of hope,'' Clinton said,  
but added that the challenge remains how to pursue hope without 
arrogance and with humility. 
</P>
<P>
	He asked his audience, which included those watching by  
cybercast and broadcast, to write down the three things they worry 
about most for the new millennium and the three things for which 
they have the greatest hope. 
</P>
<P>
	Then see ``what if anything you can do about either one,'' the  
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	The event was part of the White House's Millennium Evenings.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Splits With Gore on Welfare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLYMOUTH, N.H. (AP) -- Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley  
offered a glimpse of his battle plan for the 2000 Democratic 
presidential nomination Tuesday, saying that the 1996 welfare 
overhaul signed by President Clinton ``cut the bond between the 
mother and the child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we clearly have a difference on welfare,'' Bradley  
said when pressed during a morning radio interview to distinguish 
himself from Vice President Al Gore, the presumed front-runner for 
the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	The law that Clinton signed in 1996, over objections from  
liberals, transformed welfare from a federal entitlement to a block 
grant that enabled states to craft their own plans to help the 
needy. Bradley's remarks came one day after he predicted that 
independent and Republican voters would be more likely to side with 
him than Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought there was a federal obligation to individual  
children who are poor,'' Bradley said, ``not simply an obligation 
to take a pot of money and send it from one group of politicians to 
another group of politicians in a state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elaborating later to a high school government class, Bradley  
called the welfare system ``a disaster.'' But he said his preferred 
solution would have been continued state experimentation and a 
continued commitment that any needed child is entitled to welfare 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The second day of Bradley's three-day swing through New  
Hampshire, host to the nation's first presidential primary, had the 
same rhythm as the first day. 
</P>
<P>
	Left to his own devices, Bradley talked about values and  
basketball and children. But nudged by reporters and members of the 
public, he offered hints of how he differs from Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to welfare reform, Bradley said voters will find  
distinctions between them on tax policy. He offered no specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Democratic operatives, pointing to Gore's ability to tap  
Clinton's political operation, say Bradley must offer Democratic 
voters a reason for voting against the sitting vice president. Even 
his backers in New Hampshire say that the formula for a Bradley 
victory in 2000 must include public dissatisfaction with the status 
quo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to have a break from this (Clinton-Gore)  
administration,'' said Wayne King, a former state senator who ran 
unsuccessfully for governor in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Parents of Truants Face Jail in Md. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Go to class -- or send your parents to jail.  
</P>
<P>
	That's the harsh lesson this semester at Canton Middle School.  
Eight parents were hauled into court Monday after repeatedly 
failing to get their children to campus on time -- and four were 
found guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentencing was set for Feb. 12, when each could get up to 30  
days in jail, a $500 fine or even lose custody. The cases of the 
other parents were postponed, but all could face similar penalties 
if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tried all the incentives, all the positive things and there  
was still a core group and we knew that probably some parents 
needed a different approach,'' said Craig Spilman, the principal at 
Canton. 
</P>
<P>
	Spilman said 12 percent to 15 percent of his school's 750  
students have ``serious'' attendance problems. Among them is 
Michael Pazdzioko, who missed 35 days during the last school year 
and 27 so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day she gets up and they talk, and she asks him if he's  
going to school,'' attorney Susan Land told District Judge 
Charlotte Cooksey, explaining the difficulty her client, Helen 
Pazdzioko, has in getting her son to attend school. 
</P>
<P>
	``He says yes and she goes to work... There's not much more she  
can do other than quit her job and go to school with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She told the judge that her son skips school because he is  
``picked on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooksey told Mrs. Pazdzioko that there could be no more excuses.  
</P>
<P>
	``The problem has got to be solved. It can be solved in a way  
you and your son like, but it has to be solved,'' the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Canton isn't the only school cracking down on habitual truants  
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In Greenville, S.C., for instance, officials kicked off the  
school year in August with a ``truancy blitz'' -- highlighted by a 
trip to court for dozens of students. The children watched as a 
mother was ordered to pay a $100 fine after letting her son miss 28 
school days the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, a Fayette County, Ky., judge ordered a woman to  
spend six months in jail because her two daughters missed a 
combined 116 days of class over 1 1/2 school years. 
</P>
<P>
	And on Jan. 15, a Mississippi woman got 30 days in jail for  
violating a truancy law. She had failed to send her children for 
several weeks because they had head lice. 
</P>
<P>
	At Canton Middle School, officials began the year by singling  
out 48 students with attendance troubles, and then tried to 
encourage and cajole parents into getting their children to school 
on time. Eventually, parents were threatened with legal action; 
some were hauled into court for a warning in November. 
</P>
<P>
	The program appears to be working. Attendance, while still  
slightly below the state average, rose from 88.4 percent during the 
fall of 1997, to 91.2 percent this fall at the school, Spilman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting police to help deliver letters to parents on official  
police stationery -- and the state's attorney's office to press 
charges -- impressed parents with the seriousness of truancy, 
Spilman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was our concept,'' he said. ``To put some teeth behind it  
in a pretty straightforward way.''

<HEADLINE> Chandler's Long, Strange Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Chris Chandler's expression was one part  
bemusement, one part bafflement. 
</P>
<P>
	C'mon, he said Tuesday, how could anyone actually suggest he was  
a superior quarterback to John Elway? 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Chandler? He's the guy whose career path looks like a Rand  
McNally road map, ``a really strange trip'' by his own estimation. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Chandler? He's the guy who was cut by Tampa Bay in the  
middle of the season, the guy who was dumped by the Cardinals in 
favor of Steve Beuerlein, the guy who was traded to the Atlanta 
Falcons a few years ago for two low-round draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
	``That amuses me,'' Chandler said at the Super Bowl's Media Day,  
making no effort to hide his smirk when a reporter noted that his 
statistics during the last two years were better than Elway's. 
``I've been playing really well, but to say I'm the better 
quarterback, well, I find that funny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there it is, clear for everyone to see in the ambiguous but  
unerring hodgepodge of numbers known as the NFL quarterback 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	--1997, Chandler 95.1, Elway 87.5.  
</P>
<P>
	--1998, Chandler 100.9, Elway 93.0.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad he's found a place where he really fits in and really  
feels comfortable with the offense and what's going on,'' Elway 
said. ``He's kind of bounced around, and it's tough to get too 
comfortable when you're playing in new systems all the time and 
with new coaches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old Chandler, his hair graying and thinning on top,  
has bounced around more than a college student's checkbook. 
</P>
<P>
	He started out in 1988 with Indianapolis, but lasted only two  
seasons. He moved on to Tampa Bay, but was cut midway through his 
second season. Picked up by the Cardinals, Chandler solidified a 
relationship that would forever define his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Rhome, who had worked out with Chandler after his college  
career at Washington, was an assistant coach at Phoenix. He knew 
Chandler was suspicious and hard-headed but liked him nonetheless, 
seduced by his strong right arm and fiery competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the 1991 season, however, Rhome delivered an  
ultimatum to his reluctant student: ``I can't coach you. You've got 
all the answers and don't trust anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler disappeared for a few weeks, then returned to Rhome's  
office waving a surrender flag. He wanted to be an NFL quarterback, 
and he wanted Rhome to be his mentor. 
</P>
<P>
	``He taught me how play the game,'' Chandler said, his  
admiration for Rhome apparent in every word. ``I'd be in the cheese 
line somewhere if he hadn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their relationship lasted 4 1/2 years, breaking up when the  
Cardinals signed Beuerlein, reuniting again for two seasons in 
Houston. Chandler put up solid numbers for the Oilers, but he was 
plagued by injuries -- a hindrance throughout his career -- and he 
was beginning to wear a dreaded name tag: 
</P>
<P>
	Hello, I'm Chris Chandler. Journeyman.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've always thought Chandler was a good quarterback,'' said  
Denver cornerback Ray Crockett, who will face Chandler in Sunday's 
Super Bowl. ``But he's always been injured. He would have one good 
game, then be injured for two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries piled on top of injuries, beginning with a torn-up knee  
that cost Chandler the starting job in Indianapolis in 1989. The 
more times he went down, the more he seemed intent on proving his 
toughness. He would stand defiantly in the pocket, needlessly 
absorbing punishment when other quarterbacks had the good sense to 
throw the ball away. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's too tough,'' Rhome said. ``There's a fine line when  
deciding whether to take it to the limit. ... Hey, give it a 
chance, then get rid of it. That's what I'm talking about. He's 
going through levels. That's what it takes for all great 
quarterbacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, it took a lot longer for Chandler to reach the point  
where he was sitting Tuesday, a journeyman-turned-Super Bowl 
quarterback, gazing upon a horde of reporters who were restrained 
by metal barriers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought this day would come,'' Chandler admitted. ``I  
thought it would be cool for something like that to happen, but, 
realistically, I was never thinking it would happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, it's been a really strange trip.  
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't think about the road it took to get here that  
much anymore,'' Chandler said. ``Tampa Bay seems like a lifetime 
ago. Sometimes, I forget I played for the Colts. Forgetting about 
some of the past times is the best way to get over it.''

<HEADLINE> Schulz Knocked Off Tyson List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Axel Schulz was at ringside when Mike Tyson  
knocked out Francois Botha. That's apparently as close to Tyson in 
action as the German heavyweight is going to get. 
</P>
<P>
	When Tyson dispatched Botha with a single right to the head Jan.  
16 in the MGM Grand at Las Vegas, Botha thought he was going to be 
next to take on the former undisputed heavyweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tuesday, Wilfred Sauerland, Schulz's manager, said in  
Frankfurt, Germany, that Showtime, the cable network with a 
multiple-fight deal with Tyson, was not interested in a a 
Tyson-Schulz match April 24 at the MGM Grand. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the end of all dreams,'' said Sauerland, noting a fight  
contract had been drawn up and had been ready to sign. ``The 
subject is closed. Axel is very disappointed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying he's in or out,'' said Jay Larkin, who runs  
boxing for Showtime and SET, it's pay-per-view arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Larkin, however, also said, ``It would be very difficult for us  
to sell Mike Tyson against a guy who lost to the guy he just beat. 
And Schulz in not exactly a household word in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Botha, knocked out in the fifth round by Tyson on Jan. 16,  
outpointed Schulz for the vacant IBF title Dec. 9, 1995, at 
Stuttgart, Germany. Schulz had not fought in the United States 
since he lost a decision to George Foreman April 22, 1995, in a 
bout preceding his loss to Botha. 
</P>
<P>
	Larkin said others being considered for the next fight in  
Tyson's latest comeback included former IBF champion Michael 
Moorer; Lou Savarese, who knocked out former champion James 
``Buster'' Douglas in the first round and who lost a decision to 
Foreman; Shannon Briggs, who beat Foreman on a controversial 
decision; Herbie Hide, WBO champion from Britain, and Brian Nielsen 
of Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
	Larkin said Donovan ``Razor'' Ruddock, who has lost twice to  
Tyson, was not on the list. 
</P>
<P>
	Sauerland said Showtime was concerned about lower than expected  
income from Tyson's pay-per-view fight against Botha. 
</P>
<P>
	Larkin, however, said, ``From Showtime's standpoint, it did  
fine. There were about 750,000 buys on cable and satellite 
(averaging $45), making it the most successful pay-per-view event 
in the last 20 months. But Tyson is only measured by his own past 
success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Botha bout was Tyson's first since he bit Evander  
Holyfield's ears and was disqualified June 28, 1997.

<HEADLINE> NBA Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	No one is going to replace Michael Jordan on the Chicago Bulls.  
Brent Barry knows he's merely filling MJ's spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry, the former NBA slam dunk champion and son of Hall of  
Famer Rick Barry, signed a six-year, $27 million contract Monday 
with the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	The free agent will take over the shooting guard role left by  
Jordan's retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no fun to be part of the cleanup crew, but hopefully that  
will only last a year or two and you get back to where the team was 
before,'' Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry liked the reports he heard on new coach Tim Floyd, and  
that convinced him to sign with the decimated NBA champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm silly to come here, but he is crazy to be coaching here,''  
Barry said. ``That's the way I look at it. Any guy that crazy I 
want to play for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barry averaged 9.6 points per game in three seasons with the Los  
Angeles Clippers and Miami Heat. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he does play well in Chicago, then they think they've got  
the next Michael Jordan,'' Miami coach Pat Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Clippers got good news when they learned Michael  
Olowokandi, the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft from Pacific 
University, was released from his contract with Kinder Bologna of 
the Italian League. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7-foot-1 center had signed with Kinder about 24 hours before  
the NBA and its players agreed recently to end the owners' lockout. 
Olowokandi's deal with Kinder bound him to the club until Feb. 15, 
but the team reportedly decided to release him and save money 
because he had averaged only 7.7 points and 5.6 rebounds in six 
games in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a surprise to me,'' Clippers vice president of  
basketball operations Elgin Baylor said. ``I'm sure it's probably a 
surprise to him, too, that they let him out of his contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor expects Olowokandi to join the team Wednesday night in  
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Steve Nash, acquired in a draft-day trade from Phoenix,  
signed a six-year contract extension with the Dallas Mavericks that 
reportedly is worth $18 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Hurley, a five-year NBA veteran who suffered  
life-threatening injuries in a two-car accident in his rookie 
season with the Sacramento Kings, was waived by the Vancouver 
Grizzlies. The Grizzlies had acquired Hurley, a former Duke star, 
in a four-player deal with Sacramento last Feb. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phoenix Suns re-signed free agents Rex Chapman and Clifford  
Robinson along with first-round draft pick Pat Garrity and another 
first-year player, Gerald Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Garrity was selected with the 19th pick in the 1998 draft by  
Milwaukee but was later traded to Dallas and then Phoenix in a 
three-way deal. He played at Notre Dame under former Suns coach 
John McLeod. 
</P>
<P>
	The Portland Trail Blazers signed rookie guard Bonzi Wells to a  
three-year contract. Financial terms were not disclosed. Wells, 
drafted out of Ball State, was acquired from the Detroit Pistons 
last week for a conditional first-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other guards -- James Blackwell, Ernest Hall and Damian  
Owens -- were cut by Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
	Three players were cut by the Atlanta Hawks: former Georgia Tech  
star Brian Oliver; Mitch Henderson, a rookie from Princeton, and 
Jason Lawson, a reserve last season with Orlando.

<HEADLINE>  1,000 Die in Colombia Quake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARMENIA, Colombia (AP) -- Stunned residents in Colombia's coffee  
belt chose to wait out the night around bonfires rather than 
venture back into their crumpled homes today after a powerful 
earthquake killed at least 1,000 people and injured hundreds of 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	The magnitude 6 earthquake flattened cities and towns across  
western Colombia on Monday, rattling buildings as far away as the 
capital, Bogota, 140 miles from the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of the dead lived in Armenia, a city of 220,000  
residents where entire neighborhoods were reduced to rubble and 
left without water or electricity, and where residents say relief 
has been slow to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Ciro Antonio Guiza, the city's deputy fire chief, said  
rescue workers were so strapped that many bodies remained on the 
street uncollected. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are more than 1,000 dead, perhaps more than 2,000 in  
Armenia alone,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of bodies were trapped in 25 buildings that collapsed,  
he said. In one ten-story apartment building alone, an estimated 60 
people were crushed alive, Guiza said. 
</P>
<P>
	Iliana Patricia Vega, 26, paced the working-class Brasilia Nueva  
district in tears, her bright red dress torn, her right shoulder 
naked to the cool night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, my baby, he was so beautiful,'' she said of her 10-year  
old son, Jon Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	She was on the second floor with her son and 6-year-old daughter  
when everything collapsed, killing the boy almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does anyone have any medicine. Can I get some medicine?'' she  
cried, fretting over a nasty gash to the little girl's forehead. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the street, Pedro Maria Londono, 46, and the rest of his  
four-member family were miraculously saved when every room but the 
one they were in was buried in rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 12 seconds, I lost what took 20 years to build,'' Londono  
said. ``Is the government going to help us?'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  1,000 Die in Colombia Quake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARMENIA, Colombia (AP) -- Stunned residents in Colombia's coffee  
belt chose to wait out the night around bonfires rather than 
venture back into their crumpled homes today after a powerful 
earthquake killed at least 1,000 people and injured hundreds of 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	The magnitude 6 earthquake flattened cities and towns across  
western Colombia on Monday, rattling buildings as far away as the 
capital, Bogota, 140 miles from the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of the dead lived in Armenia, a city of 220,000  
residents where entire neighborhoods were reduced to rubble and 
left without water or electricity, and where residents say relief 
has been slow to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Ciro Antonio Guiza, the city's deputy fire chief, said  
rescue workers were so strapped that many bodies remained on the 
street uncollected. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are more than 1,000 dead, perhaps more than 2,000 in  
Armenia alone,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of bodies were trapped in 25 buildings that collapsed,  
he said. In one ten-story apartment building alone, an estimated 60 
people were crushed alive, Guiza said. 
</P>
<P>
	Iliana Patricia Vega, 26, paced the working-class Brasilia Nueva  
district in tears, her bright red dress torn, her right shoulder 
naked to the cool night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, my baby, he was so beautiful,'' she said of her 10-year  
old son, Jon Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	She was on the second floor with her son and 6-year-old daughter  
when everything collapsed, killing the boy almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does anyone have any medicine. Can I get some medicine?'' she  
cried, fretting over a nasty gash to the little girl's forehead. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the street, Pedro Maria Londono, 46, and the rest of his  
four-member family were miraculously saved when every room but the 
one they were in was buried in rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 12 seconds, I lost what took 20 years to build,'' Londono  
said. ``Is the government going to help us?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just up the street, the corpse of Elda Rincon, 54, was covered  
with a white sheet. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to incinerate my mother first thing in the

<HEADLINE> Court Reinstates Hubbell Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A divided federal appeals court Tuesday  
reinstated a tax evasion case against presidential friend Webster 
Hubbell but raised serious questions over using Hubbell's own 
financial papers to prosecute him. 
</P>
<P>
	In a pair of 2-1 rulings, the court found that prosecutor  
Kenneth Starr did not exceed his authority in bringing the case 
against Hubbell, his wife, his tax lawyer and his tax preparer. And 
the court found that Hubbell cannot avoid prosecution just because 
the foundation of the case is 13,120 pages of Hubbell's own 
financial records, which he turned over to Starr under a limited 
grant of immunity from prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court validated Starr's approach to the  
investigation, saying it was enough to pursue Hubbell based on the 
theory that hundreds of thousands of dollars paid to him from 
friends of the president was hush money designed to ensure his 
silence in Starr's Whitewater probe of the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	``The timing, sources and extent of the payments make the belief  
that they were hush money reasonable,'' said the U.S. Circuit Court 
of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The issue was whether 
Starr should have obtained permission from Attorney General Janet 
Reno before bringing the tax case against Hubbell. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court reversed U.S. District Judge James Robertson's  
ruling last July that Starr was violating Hubbell's Fifth Amendment 
right against self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	But the appeals court said that if a new trial is to take place,  
Starr must show ``reasonably particular knowledge'' of the 
existence of Hubbell's financial records before the prosecutor 
subpoenaed them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Should the independent counsel prove unable to meet the  
requisite evidentiary burden, the contents of those documents will 
be inadmissible,'' the court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr has said he knew about consulting payments to Hubbell from  
the Riady family of Indonesia and the city of Los Angeles, but 
``these snippets of information do not come close to establishing 
the existence of the myriad of documents sought through the 
subpoena,'' said the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``The knowledge that Hubbell had one or two clients establishes  
very little else, and certainly does not even approach the level of 
establishing that Hubbell had done work for fifteen separate 
clients, let alone the type of records he kept of those 
activities,'' the court added. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell said he was pleased with the part of the ruling dealing  
with his Fifth Amendment rights and ``hopeful that this matter will 
come to an end real soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Starr took the position early in the case that his  
office didn't know specifics of the documents before subpoenaing 
them, ``that they gave me immunity to get the documents and then 
they used those documents to later indict. ... And that's wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're innocent, not only myself but my wife and my friends of  
any of the underlying charges,'' Hubbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Stephen Williams, a Reagan appointee, dissented from the  
ruling dealing with Hubbell's documents, saying Starr was being 
held to an unfairly high standard for using the papers. Williams 
said the contents of the documents are ``unprotected'' by a grant 
of immunity. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge David Tatel, a Clinton appointee, dissented from part of  
the ruling, declaring Starr had indeed exceeded his authority in 
bringing the tax case against Hubbell. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr is able ``to comb through all of Hubbell's investments and  
expenditures -- including, as the indictment reveals, his purchase 
of clothes, groceries and laundry services -- until discovering some 
illegality on which to indict him,'' Tatel complained. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very gratified by the majority opinion on the Fifth  
Amendment issue which endorsed Judge Robertson's major 
pronouncements below,'' said Hubbell lawyer John Nields. ``And 
we're gratified by the dissent on jurisdiction and are evaluating 
our options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alleging that Hubbell owes nearly $900,000 in taxes and  
penalties on income for various years starting in 1989, Starr found 
that Hubbell was paid some $700,000 in the years after he came 
under investigation by the prosecutor's office in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-count grand jury indictment charged that Hubbell  
``performed little or no work'' for the consulting fees he received 
from friends of the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell, a former associate attorney general, served a 19-month  
prison term after pleading guilty in December 1994 to tax evasion 
and mail fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	In pleading guilty, Hubbell promised to cooperate in Starr's  
investigation of Hillary Rodham Clinton's work while at the Rose 
Law Firm on behalf of the failing Arkansas savings and loan owned 
by her Whitewater business partners. His frequent memory lapses 
frustrated Starr's efforts to delve into Whitewater.

<HEADLINE> Greek Orthodox Leader Denies Ouster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Rev. Robert G. Stephanopoulos, a prominent  
Greek Orthodox leader and father of former White House aide George 
Stephanopoulos, denied reports that he has been removed as head of 
Holy Trinity cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am still the dean of the cathedral,'' Stephanopoulos said  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Greek archdiocese, the Rev. Mark Arey,  
agreed that Stephanopoulos retains the title. However, he said the 
Rev. J. Gabriel Karambis will assume administrative and pastoral 
leadership functions formerly done by Stephanopoulos. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute is the latest in a feud within U.S. Greek Orthodoxy.  
Stephanopoulos said he would clarify his status this week at a 
meeting with the church's U.S. leader, Archbishop Spyridon. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Herald, a Greek newspaper based in New York,  
reported Monday that Stephanopoulos, the dean of the New York 
cathedral, had been ``stripped by Archbishop Spyridon of most of 
his administrative duties'' and made an ``assistant'' under 
Karambis, who had been given ``pastoral authority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arey said ``assistant'' was inaccurate.  
</P>
<P>
	Stephanopoulos had earlier joined more than 100 priests in  
signing a letter critical of Spyridon's administration. The 
archbishop tried to get rid of him to put fear in the rest of the 
clergy, according to Dean Popps, spokesman for Greek Orthodox 
American Leaders, an independent lay organization based in 
Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	GOAL has accused Spyridon of abuses of power and wants him  
removed, and Spyridon's archdiocese has filed a lawsuit against the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Popps contended that Spyridon acted against Stephanopoulos and  
two other signers after the archbishop won the backing of 
Orthodoxy's worldwide spiritual leader, Ecumenical Patriarch 
Bartholomew, at a meeting on the American split. 
</P>
<P>
	Bartholomew has direct jurisdiction over the U.S. Greek church  
and appointed Spyridon in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephanopoulos said Spyridon was only ``giving me an additional  
assignment'' supervising pastoral missions. Asked whether he 
retained authority as well as the dean's title, Stephanopoulos said 
questions remain about administration of the cathedral and the 
priestly ministries.

<HEADLINE> Falcons Relish Underdog Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Ray Buchanan has been dogged for guaranteeing a  
Super Bowl victory. He's been dogged about Atlanta's lowly status 
in the NFL. And he's been dogged by the many frustrated opponents 
he's shut down for most of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	So on Tuesday, Media Day at the Super Bowl, he showed up for the  
hordes of interviewers wearing a black leather dog collar with 
silver studs. He bought it at a pet store for his Rottweiler, named 
Tyson because ``he bites ears.'' But he decided to wear it for 
interviews to make a point. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm doing this in fun,'' the Pro Bowl cornerback said.  
``People have us as seven-point underdogs. So I thought I would put 
on my dog collar. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lack of respect is always going to be there until you  
start proving yourself as a team,'' added Buchanan, one of the 
first free agents coach Dan Reeves signed when he took over the 
Falcons in 1997. ``This team went through a lot of trials and 
tribulations to try to win football games. It's a big shock to a 
lot of people that the Atlanta Falcons are here. But if you take a 
good look at how we play football, you'll see why we're here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It seems that nobody on either side believes the Falcons should  
be much of an underdog. They did go 16-2. They beat their NFC West 
nemesis, the 49ers, two times, including once in the playoffs. They 
went to Minnesota and eliminated the highest scoring team in league 
history to win the NFC title. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, at least, no one is praising the Falcons more than  
the guys on the team they'll meet in Sunday's game. The Broncos 
know all about this underdog stuff -- the Green Bay Packers were an 
even bigger favorite (12) to handle Denver a year ago. But who went 
home with the championship rings? 
</P>
<P>
	As defending champions, the Broncos wonder just who has any kind  
of edge -- the team trying to make history with a second straight 
win or the upstarts who have already surprised nearly everyone by 
getting this far. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anything, it can work against you,'' safety Steve Atwater  
said, referring to the Broncos' role as favorites. ``You can tend 
to get a little complacent and your opponents can use that as 
motivation. They haven't been here, so they will be fired up. We 
have to make sure we're more fired up than they are. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's more difficult to come in the way we are, as a  
defending champion. We have to come up like last year, very 
hungry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Buchanan held court from his podium, his collar nearly  
blinding everyone when the sun reflected off the studs, tackle Bob 
Whitfield looked over from his berth about 10 yards away, shook his 
head and laughed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if that's stylin','' he said. ``But I know what  
Ray's trying to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Which is?  
</P>
<P>
	``Let's have some fun, because things get a whole lot more  
serious after today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Things were still so silly Tuesday, however, that a reporter  
from Comedy Central looked at Buchanan's collar and asked, ``Are 
you housebroken?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams seemed to enjoy the cattle call at Pro Player  
Stadium. And everyone dismissed the favorite-underdog scenario with 
relish. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may sound crazy,'' Broncos linebacker John Mobley said,  
``but we feel like we're the underdog here. I think with that, 
everybody is going to come out and play like the underdog, where we 
have to fight, scratch and claw to get on top and get where we want 
to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That, of course, is right where Denver has been since beating  
the Packers a year ago: on top of the NFL. It's not a place the 
Falcons have been close to until now. 
</P>
<P>
	How better to define an underdog than that?  
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at where this team came from,'' Buchanan said,  
adjusting his collar so it shined directly into a television 
camera, ``it was only fate that we were supposed to be here and win 
this game. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people put a lot of different hurdles in front of  
this team, but we just went ahead and jumped over every one of 
them. I feel this team can get over any hurdle that may be placed 
in front of us, if only everybody believes.''

<HEADLINE> Poll: Mrs. Clinton Good for Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton leads Republicans  
Rudolph Giuliani and Alfonse D'Amato in theoretical matchups for 
next year's New York Senate race, according to a statewide poll 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, by Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion,  
found the first lady was favored by 53 percent of registered voters 
while Giuliani, New York City's mayor, was the choice of 42 percent 
of voters. About 6 percent were undecided in the heavily Democratic 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	Against D'Amato, who was defeated by Democrat Charles Schumer in  
November in his bid for a fourth Senate term, Mrs. Clinton leads 57 
percent to 38 percent, with 5 percent of voters undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	While some New York Democrats are boosting her as a potential  
candidate for the seat being given up next year by fellow Democrat 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, she has not said if she is interested in 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
	If she did decide to run, residency would not be a problem with  
officials of the state Board of Elections, who say she would have 
until Election Day to establish a residence. Robert Kennedy was a 
latecomer to New York when he won a Senate seat in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Giuliani and D'Amato have said they are considering seeking  
the GOP nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll of 513 registered voters was conducted  
Sunday. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage 
points.

<HEADLINE> Hand Transplant Man Moves Finger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- For the first time in 13 years, Matthew  
Scott wiggled a finger on his left hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hand looks beautiful, very pink, warm, very normal,'' said  
Dr. Jon Jones, a member of the team that attached the donor hand in 
the first such operation in U.S. history. ``It looks just like the 
other hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott has been asked not to move his hand very much for the next  
week or so because he might tear some of the stitches used to sew 
his tendons, nerves, arteries and veins to those in the donor hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``But he said he wanted to do this -- move the index finger -- and  
he really liked it,'' Jones said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors also said there are no signs of rejection or infection.  
</P>
<P>
	Scott traded a metal-and-plastic prosthesis for a human hand  
earlier this week -- the first transplant of its kind performed in 
the United States. The price: a lifetime on anti-rejection drugs 
that will suppress his immune system, leaving him vulnerable to 
infection, disease, even death. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott, 37, lost his dominant hand in the explosion of an M-80, a  
powerful and illegal firecracker, on Dec. 23, 1985. He was given a 
donor hand in 14 1/2 hours of surgery ending Monday at Jewish Hospital 
in Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott has been a diabetic since his early 20s and takes daily  
insulin shots. In an interview earlier this month, he said he 
expected his diabetes to worsen after the transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	The anti-rejection package of medications Scott is taking  
includes a steroid, which can cause ``steroid-induced diabetes'' in 
transplant patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said Scott's ability to wiggle the finger doesn't  
necessarily mean recovery will be swift. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really doesn't mean anything from a recovery point of view,  
because we expect that to occur,'' Jones said. ``We expect him to 
be able to move his fingers. But for him psychologically, it's very 
important, so we let him do it.''

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Former San Francisco Giants stars Joe  
Amalfitano, Robby Thompson and Dave Righetti are returning to their 
former team to help develop young players. 
</P>
<P>
	Amalfitano, a 10-year major league infielder who was a rookie  
starter on the New York Giants' 1954 World Series-winning team, has 
been hired as special assistant for player development. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, an 11-year second baseman for the Giants and a  
two-time All-Star, was made a roving infield instructor. 
</P>
<P>
	Righetti, who pitched for the Giants from 1991-93 and ranks 14th  
on the career saves list with 252, will be a roving pitching 
instructor. 
</P>
<P>
	``These three men are part of our history and they belong in  
this organization,'' Giants general manager Brian Sabean said 
Tuesday. ``My experience has taught me that there is a direct 
correlation between tradition and player development. In terms of 
quantity and quality, we now have an outstanding roster of former 
Giants who are making significant contributions in our minor league 
system and front office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three join 18 former Giants employed by the team in player  
development, scouting and the front office, including Willie Mays, 
Orlando Cepeda and Vida Blue.

<HEADLINE> Killer's Ex-Wife Asks for Leniency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Thomas Capano's ex-wife made no excuses  
for her husband, a once-prominent lawyer convicted of killing his 
mistress. She just wants him to live -- for the sake of his four 
young daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not here to stand by my man. I'm here to stand by my  
daughters,'' Kay Ryan said Monday. She adopted her maiden name last 
year after divorcing Capano and ending a 26-year marriage that 
produced four children and was -- by Capano's own admission -- marked 
by numerous infidelities. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 18, a jury returned a guilty verdict against Capano, a  
former state prosecutor and high-profile political adviser. He was 
convicted of murdering Anne Marie Fahey, the governor's scheduling 
secretary, and dumping her body at sea in June 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers are asking the jury to recommend that Superior  
Court Judge William Swain Lee give Capano life in prison without 
parole, instead of the death penalty. The hearing is expected to 
last through the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Capano's trial began in late October, Ms. Ryan has been a  
frequent visitor to the courtroom, often accompanying her teen-age 
daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano's youngest daughter, 13-year-old Alexandria, said that  
even with her father in jail, he can still offer encouragement and 
she can communicate with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still there as much as he can be and we need that,'' she  
said, her voice breaking as she spoke to the jury. ``He's still our 
dad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Capano killed Ms. Fahey because she wanted to  
end their secret, three-year affair. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am as repulsed by his vile actions and behavior as most of  
you here in this courtroom,'' Ms. Ryan said. But, she added, ``for 
everything he has done, he has been a loving father.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capano's ex-wife also spoke her strong remorse for what has  
happened to Ms. Fahey's brothers and sister, saying she couldn't 
imagine suffering through such an event. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so sorry for your loss, and I'm so sorry that Tom was  
somehow involved in that,'' she said, crying.

<HEADLINE> Newspaper Article Riles O'Neal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) -- Shaquille O'Neal was unhappy  
Tuesday as the Los Angeles Lakers finished their final session of a 
six-day preseason training camp at UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
	But the source of his discontent had nothing to do with  
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Some publications have said the Lakers would finish as low as  
fourth in the NBA's Western Conference -- behind San Antonio, 
Houston and Utah. O'Neal saw one, and didn't like it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to show them who the big men in the West really  
are,'' O'Neal said. ``I'm going to kill them again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers swept four games from San Antonio last season.  
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal issued a challenge to 7-footers David Robinson and Tim  
Duncan of the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like David Robinson anyway,'' the Lakers' center said  
in a quiet voice. ``Tim Duncan is too light. ... I'm starting to 
get like Mike Tyson. I'm coming back. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of them do nothing with me. If they don't like it, they  
can come to me on the court or off the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Derek Harper, whom the Lakers signed last week to add some  
experience and leadership to the team, took O'Neal's outburst as a 
good sign. 
</P>
<P>
	``It (the article) should be insulting to him,'' Harper said.  
``He'll use it to his advantage. He wants respect. The only way to 
get respect is to beat Utah and advance past the conference final. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shaq wants a ring. I want a ring. But Robinson wants a ring,  
too. (Karl) Malone and (John) Stockton want a ring. I know what 
those teams are doing. They're preparing for war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harper said the Lakers' hopes for a championship revolve around  
O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to go as far as he takes us,'' Harper said.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Reflects on Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sure that the answers lie deeper than the Y2K  
bug or endless New Year's toasts, President Clinton welcomed 
scholars to the White House to ponder the significance of the 
fast-approaching new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	The East Room event Monday night began not with a forecast into  
the future, but with a look back at the first millennium event 1000 
years ago and how it was received by the Western world at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the lessons of the last millennium are evidence  
that ``ordinary people, even a long time ago, can make a difference 
toward a good end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the stories of people at the dawn of this millennium, ``we  
hear our own fears and hopes that what we do will matter today and 
tomorrow,'' first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton told an audience that 
included some of the nation's foremost theologians and scholars of 
medieval history. 
</P>
<P>
	Professor Natalie Zemon Davis, a specialist on the culture of  
early modern Europe, captured the mood of the first millennium, 
which she said spread over several decades before and after the 
actual event. While the period around 1000 A.D. prompted many 
doomsayers to predict the apocalypse, it also inspired some 
movements toward peace and social change. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our dreammaking capacity, our capacity to imagine, can give  
birth to the good as well as the bad,'' said Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the lessons of the last millennium are evidence  
that ``ordinary people, even a long time ago, can make a difference 
toward a good end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaping centuries ahead, Professor Martin E. Marty, one of the  
leading interpreters of American religion, discussed how the fast 
approaching 2000 will impact humanity. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be seeking meaning with new intensity at this time,''  
said Marty, who now directs the Public Religion Project at the 
University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Marty said some people will still have apocalyptic visions, both  
religious and secular, with people fearing complete chaos caused by 
such phenomena as the millennium bug. Others will see the 
millennium as time for progressive change, engaging in ``realistic 
hope'' for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said this hope exists despite the certainty of  
human beings ``making the same old mistakes over and over again, 
millennium after millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You all know I am a walking apostle of hope,'' Clinton said,  
but added that the challenge remains how to pursue hope without 
arrogance and with humility. 
</P>
<P>
	He asked his audience, which included those watching by  
cybercast and broadcast, to write down the three things they worry 
about most for the new millennium and the three things for which 
they have the greatest hope. 
</P>
<P>
	Then see ``what if anything you can do about either one,'' the  
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	The event was part of the White House's Millennium Evenings.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed higher Tuesday,  
boosted by an overnight rally on Wall Street and the easing of 
worries that China might devalue its currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese stocks rose for a second straight session. The  
benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 173.20 points, or 
1.22 percent, ending the day at 14,382.01 points. On Monday, the 
average closed up 54.41 points, or 0.38 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices rose on the back of Wall Street's overnight gains  
and active buying of blue chips by institutional investors who 
manage public and pension funds, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also boosting the Tokyo stock market was an announcement Monday  
by the Financial Reconstruction Commission that major Japanese 
banks will be required to make provisions covering 70 percent of 
their unguaranteed loans to companies that ``may go bankrupt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar fell against the Japanese yen after  
China denied that it would devalue its currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 113.56 yen at late afternoon, down 0.78  
yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York 
level of 113.96 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar, which had strengthened Friday and early Monday in  
part because of rumors of an impending Chinese devaluation, fell 
back after Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji announced the yuan would 
remain stable in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia share prices surged as fears subsided of a possible  
devaluation of the Chinese currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jakarta Stock Exchange's key Composite Index rose 15.674  
points, or 4.1 percent, to close at 398.152. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Hong Kong closed generally higher, snapping a  
three losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, rose 10.33 points, or 0.1 percent, closing at 9,509.83. 
On Monday, the index had slumped 239.02 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers attributed the rise to a technical rebound following  
Monday's sharp falls, which were caused by worries that China might 
devalue its currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mostly higher following Monday's  
steep falls. The Straits Times Index rose 19.12 points, or 1.4 
percent, to 1,417.14. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed higher on late support-buying by the  
government's stock stabilization fund. The market's key Weighted 
Stock Price Index rose 82.43 points, or 1.4 percent, to 6,115.64. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher, boosted by  
gains in the forestry sector stocks, brokers said. The benchmark 
NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 10.51 points, or 0.4 percent, to 
2,179.30. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed higher on bargain-hunting as  
fears over a possible devaluation of the Chinese yuan faded, 
traders said. The Philippine Stock Exchange Index of 30 selected 
companies rose 30.82 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,982.26 after 
sinking 110.90 points Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed lower on a late sell-off by local  
investors. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 8.53 points, 
or 1.6 percent, to 531.23. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares closed generally lower, but the  
key index edged up on buying of selective blue-chip stocks. The 
Composite Index, which tracks 100 key stocks, rose 0.69 of a point 
to 610.88. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed higher. The Stock Exchange of  
Thailand index rose 3.41 points , or 0.9 percent, to 366.77.

<HEADLINE> Race Preference Foes Boost Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- They say the color of their skin kept them out  
of the schools of their choice. Now, Katuria Smith, a white former 
law school candidate from Washington state, and Jessie Tompkins, a 
black college student from Alabama, are in court. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want a future where students can apply ... without worrying  
that their skin color will keep them out,'' said Smith, whose case 
against the University of Washington law school, which denied her 
admission, goes to trial next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith spoke Tuesday at a news conference sponsored by  
conservative groups to launch a campaign charging the nation's top 
colleges with illegally using racial preferences in admissions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Center for Individual Rights -- a conservative private law  
firm handling the cases for Smith and Tompkins -- is running ads in 
student newspapers headlined ``Guilty by Admission'' that say 
nearly every elite college in the United States violates the law. 
</P>
<P>
	But many educators say the conservatives have misrepresented 20  
years of court rulings and overstated colleges' efforts to bring 
diversity to their campuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Colleges do not just seek racial and ethnic diversity when  
composing a class,'' said Deborah Wilds of the American Council on 
Education, a Washington umbrella group for 1,800 public and private 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
	The center also issued two 30-page handbooks, it says, to help  
students identify discrimination and to help institutions keep from 
getting sued. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics say the handbook is designed to encourage lawsuits  
such as the one by Tompkins, who is suing over a whites-only 
scholarship at historically black Alabama State. 
</P>
<P>
	``Colleges very clearly understand they may not use quotas,''  
said Norma Cantu, the assistant secretary for the Education 
Department's Office of Civil Rights, referring to programs that 
don't consider a student's merit. ``There's no need for a 
handbook.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the government, minorities made up 25.3 percent of  
college enrollment in 1995, up from 16.5 percent in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives, including former Education Secretary William J.  
Bennett, who called college diversity programs ``an antithesis of 
the civil rights movement,'' cited anecdotal evidence and a handful 
of state-specific studies as evidence that race preference without 
merit is widespread. 
</P>
<P>
	And on Wednesday, another group supporting the campaign, The  
Center for Equal Opportunity, will release a study concluding that 
the odds of a white candidate being admitted to the University of 
Virginia instead of an equally qualified black candidate are 45 to 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	The data, based on 1996 applications for 10 public Virginia  
universities, include the race, sex, SAT scores, class rank and 
high school grade point averages of 72,000 applicants who were 
admitted or rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've found use of racial ethnic preference in all of the  
states. The more selective schools tend to use preferences the 
most,'' said Roger Clegg, general counsel for the group. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rene Redwood, executive director of Americans for a Fair  
Chance, a group that advises colleges and community groups on 
affirmative action, says many programs with preferences are still 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have studies that show that there are communities that are  
healthier because women and minorities who become doctors often 
return to those communities,'' Redwood said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides in the affirmative action battle cite the 1978 Bakke  
case, in which a white student denied admission to medical school 
claimed specific slots for minority students were unconstitutional. 
The Supreme Court decided colleges could not have separate 
admissions criteria for minority students, but could consider race 
a ``plus'' factor. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, a federal appeals court in the Hopwood case from Texas  
essentially contradicted Bakke and barred the consideration of race 
in admissions and financial-aid decisions, citing other high court 
rulings involving government contracting. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court has refused to hear Hopwood, but it is binding  
only in the appeals court's region of Texas, Louisiana and 
Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	Colleges also must consider state ballot measures, such as  
California's 1996 Proposition 209, that ban many racial 
preferences.

<HEADLINE> Shareholders Approve Wachovia Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Interstate/Johnson Lane's shareholders  
Tuesday approved the brokerage firm's $230 million acquisition by 
Wachovia Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulators are expected to approve the merger sometime  
in March. The deal should be completed as soon as April. 
</P>
<P>
	Wachovia is one of many banks that have bought brokerages in an  
effort to enter the lucrative investment banking business. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the deal is completed, IJL will be integrated into Wachovia  
through a new broker-dealer subsidiary, headed by current IJL 
chairman and chief executive Jim Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
	Wachovia Securities Inc. is expected to include the activities  
of Interstate/Johnson Lane, CapTrust and all Section 20 activities 
of Wachovia's Capital Markets Division. 
</P>
<P>
	Wachovia and IJL predicted few job cuts as a result of the  
merger. Wachovia established an employee retention pool of $23 
million in restricted stock for key employees of IJL. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Seven Excused From Dragging Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- A prospective juror in the trial of a white  
man accused of dragging a black man to death was excused Tuesday 
after revealing a relative received letters from the defendant 
laced with racist remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Halmon, a middle-aged construction worker, was one of  
seven people released from jury service in the murder trial of John 
William King, the first of three white men to be tried in the June 
7 slaying of James Byrd Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	King, Shawn Allen Berry and Lawrence Russell Brewer are accused  
of killing Byrd, 49, because he was black. The men allegedly beat 
him, chained him to a pickup truck and dragged him for 2 1/2 miles, 
tearing his right arm and head from his body. 
</P>
<P>
	Halmon told attorneys his step-granddaughter, Michelle Chapman,  
received letters from King that espoused anti-black views. Miss 
Chapman is one of 53 people subpoenaed as potential witnesses in 
the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Chapman is one of several girls King contacted by letter  
while he was imprisoned from 1995 to 1997 for violating probation 
in a 1992 burglary, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The contents of the letters have not been disclosed, but  
authorities characterized them as being romantic in nature, a 
series of come-ons to girls King was acquainted with in Jasper 
before he was sent to prison. They contain details of his 
pro-Aryan, anti-black beliefs, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	A week after Byrd's mangled body was found, several of the  
girls' parents turned over the letters to investigators, District 
Attorney Guy James Gray said. The letters may be introduced as 
evidence in King's trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs had Halmon dismissed  
based on his vacillating opinion about whether he could keep his 
preconceived ideas about King's guilt from influencing his verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of 10 potential jurors interviewed Tuesday were excused.  
Four were struck because they said they oppose the death penalty. 
King, 24, would face either life in prison or the death penalty if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Two white men and a black woman who works as a state corrections  
officer made the preliminary cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers had anticipated it would take at least two weeks to find  
a jury, but the speed and limited success of the interviews 
prompted both sides to speculate that 12 jurors and two alternates 
could not be found among the 122-person pool. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three out of 10 won't get us there,'' District Attorney Guy  
James Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
	If a jury cannot be seated from the available pool, the judge  
may have to call in additional citizens for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	King has pleaded innocent. In a letter released to The Dallas  
Morning News last fall, King claimed he was dropped at his home 
after Berry gave Byrd a ride. He insists Berry and Brewer killed 
Byrd over a soured drug deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Byrd's blood was found on the shoes of all  
three suspects and other personal items and DNA samples found at 
the scene implicate all three. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors Tuesday issued a subpoena for Dallas Morning News  
reporter Lee Hancock, asking her to produce the letter from King. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to speak with our lawyers later this week and  
determine what action to take,'' said Gilbert Bailon, the paper's 
executive editor. ``We understand they want her to authenticate 
letters she received from the defendant.''

<HEADLINE> Same Plane, But Fares Differ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Airlines tout their new partnerships that  
allow passengers on different airlines to travel on the same plane 
and earn frequent flier miles redeemable from either partner. 
</P>
<P>
	What they don't say is that travelers buying tickets under those  
partnerships, known as ``code sharing,'' can pay vastly different 
prices for the same ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	An airfare analyst compared the cost of the same seat on the  
same plane and found a nearly $600 difference in the price paid for 
a ticket issued by Continental from the same ticket issued by its 
code share partner for the past year, Northwest. The only 
difference between the two tickets was which airline issued them. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Trippler, operator of the Internet-based ``Airfare  
Report,'' said the same kind of gap can be found with all of the 
partners in the nation's new string of code shares, including the 
tandems of United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, or American 
Airlines and US Airways. 
</P>
<P>
	The partner with the higher price depends on discounts and on  
which route they are being compared. 
</P>
<P>
	Trippler's warning sounds familiar: Buyer beware.  
</P>
<P>
	``Code sharing is so widespread, you better be on your toes. You  
better ask every single time, every single flight, 'Is this a code 
share?' And if so, 'With what airline?' and then ask for the price 
on both of them,'' he said on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines began code share partnerships as a means of increasing  
investor return, pooling resources and smoothing out travel for 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	While the airlines generally remain separate entities, they  
exchange frequent flier privileges and club memberships and also 
book tickets so travelers from each partner airline can make 
seamless connections no matter which one issues the tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	In doing so, airlines can help fill up each other's planes and  
also reach areas outside their normal network. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't mean code share passengers traveling on the same  
plane pay the same price. 
</P>
<P>
	To make his point, Trippler booked six different sets of  
flights, with one ticket from Continental and one from Northwest 
for each. While the flights had different numbers, depending on the 
airline issuing the ticket, they were flown on the same Northwest 
or Continental planes and had the same arrival and departure times. 
</P>
<P>
	The only difference was in the fares.  
</P>
<P>
	A Feb. 6-12 round trip from Newark to Singapore cost $847.31  
from Northwest, but $1,445.31 from Continental. A Feb. 8-10 round 
trip from Cleveland to Boise, Idaho, cost $406 from Northwest, but 
$1,650 from Continental. 
</P>
<P>
	A Northwest spokesman said that is exactly how the system is  
supposed to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't coordinate. That would be illegal,'' said airline  
spokesman Jon Austin. ``We are competing to sell tickets. On some 
code shares, that means tickets on the same plane, but that doesn't 
lessen the competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to explain the discrepancy between the Northwest and  
Continental fares, Austin replied: ``I have no idea. That would be 
asking me to read the mind of the Continental marketing folks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Continental did not immediately return a call seeking comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Travel agents and some consumer groups have fought code shares,  
saying the ``virtual merger'' of airlines will eventually stifle 
competition. More immediately, they say they further complicate the 
already puzzling world of airfares. 
</P>
<P>
	Trippler, a former travel agent, said using a travel agent is  
the best protection against paying different prices for tickets 
from code share partners. Some online travel services also offer 
fares from the perspective of both code share partners, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I seriously doubt that a Northwest agent is going to spend a  
lot of time checking the same ticket as a Continental fare,'' 
Trippler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Austin, the Northwest spokesman, said using a travel agent or  
booking directly with an airline ``is a wholly personal decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``I think a travel agent is a wonderful thing; I would  
support people who would want to go that way. On the other hand, 
there are people who book on their own or through the Internet, and 
I support that, too.''

<HEADLINE> Banana Debate in WTO Stalls Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- For a second straight day, two tiny Caribbean  
nations blocked a debate Tuesday in the World Trade Organization 
over an escalating banana dispute between the United States and the 
European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has requested approval of $520 million in  
sanctions on EU imports, saying the EU's policy on bananas violates 
global trading rules by favoring producers in former European 
colonies at the expense of cheaper Latin American varieties 
distributed by U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Lucia and Dominica, which both side with the EU, again used  
a procedural maneuver to hold up a meeting of the WTO's dispute 
settlement body. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting adjourned until Thursday amid hopes that the United  
States and the 15-nation EU would accept a compromise from WTO 
Director-General Renato Ruggiero. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. trade ambassador Rita Hayes said Washington would press  
ahead with its plan to slap 100 percent tariffs against European 
products by March 3 if the EU failed to reform its banana trading 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to stick to our timetable,'' said Hayes. ``We're  
not going to give up our rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The EU rejects the U.S. accusations, saying its new banana  
import policy addresses any trade objections. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Caribbean countries' stalling technique led to concerns  
that other nations could use the same technique if they feared the 
outcome of a meeting. This would bring the 133-nation WTO grinding 
to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think bananas is worth that,'' said Ruggiero.  
</P>
<P>
	In a separate meeting, nations failed to make headway in  
choosing a successor for Ruggiero, whose term expires in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi has the most  
support so far, followed by Moroccan trade ambassador Hassan 
Abouyoub. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 158 disputes have been referred to the WTO since it  
was founded four years ago to police global trade and open markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In 20 cases, WTO panels have ordered members to change national  
laws in the interests of fair trade. Most of the other disputes are 
still being considered. 
</P>
<P>
	A WTO panel is studying whether the EU has fulfilled its  
obligations with its new rules of banana trading, but is unlikely 
to report before April 12.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Greets the Pope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- President Clinton welcomed a frail Pope John  
Paul II with a steadying hand Tuesday and said he hoped he would 
find, in his seventh pilgrimage on U.S. soil, ``an America working 
harder to be what you have asked us to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, a Southern Baptist, addressed the Catholic spiritual  
leader as Holy Father and tried out a blessing of his own -- in the 
pope's native Polish: ``May you live a hundred years and more!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pope, 78, gave a playful smile and a weary chuckle. ``One  
hundred years? Slowly, slow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He delivered a plea for Americans to ``open wide your hearts''  
to the world's less fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
	At the welcoming ceremony staged in a suffocatingly overheated  
airport hangar, president and pontiff alike avoided simmering 
disputes -- over U.S. airstrikes against Iraq, the embargo of Cuba, 
abortion and capital punishment -- that threatened to make this, 
their fourth meeting, a prickly one. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands chanted ``John Paul Two, we love you,'' as the pope,  
with Clinton's guiding hand on his elbow, walked down a 
red-carpeted receiving line of Cabinet officials, White House staff 
and church officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Some knelt to kiss the pope's ring. His left hand trembled at  
the gold cross lying against his starch-ivory vestments. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope likened current debates on abortion and euthanasia to  
the past century's fight against slavery and racism. 
</P>
<P>
	``America faces a similar time of trial today,'' the pope said  
in halting English. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, the conflict is between a culture that affirms,  
cherishes and celebrates the gift of life, and a culture that seeks 
to declare entire groups of human beings -- the unborn, the 
terminally ill, the handicapped, and others considered 'unuseful' -- 
to be outside the boundaries of legal protection,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The line drew applause from most in the audience, but not from  
Clinton or his wife, Hillary. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, who anchored a long line of graying and  
bespectacled cardinals in the front row, sat nodding with her hands 
folded in her lap. She later met privately with the church VIPs. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope skipped the half-page that followed in his prepared  
text, in which he called on America to ``resist the culture of 
death and ... to choose life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A papal spokesman told White House officials the omission was  
made only to save time. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton honored the well-traveled pope for ``standing for human  
dignity, human rights, and religious freedom'' and for his 
``boundless physical energy, which can only find its source in 
limitless faith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He told the pope, seated in an armchair on stage, ``People still  
need to hear your message that all are God's children, all have 
fallen short of his glory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a private 20-minute meeting between Clinton and the pope,  
abortion only ``came up in passing'' and the Monica Lewinsky affair 
not at all, White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, the pope has denounced Clinton's support of  
abortion rights as ``shameful'' and the U.S. bombing of Iraq as 
``aggression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On communist Cuba, which the pope visited a year ago just as the  
Lewinsky scandal erupted, ``they both agreed that the progress to 
date has been very hard fought and small,'' Crowley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Posing stiffly in matching armchairs set in a cramped hangar  
side room, the president tried to open their bilateral talks on a 
jovial note. 
</P>
<P>
	He gestured to the half-dozen photographers angling for shot  
after shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the church should buy the company producing the film,  
and you could fund all the Catholic charities all over the world 
with it,'' Clinton joked. 
</P>
<P>
	His public remarks, however, tightly followed his script as the  
White House was anxious not to let any policy disagreements with 
the Vatican cloud the pope's sunny and much anticipated 30-hour 
stay here. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said that, among the nation's 62 million Catholics and  
all Americans, he hoped the pontiff would find on this brief trip 
``an America working harder to be what you have asked us to be -- an 
example of justice and civic virtues, freedom fulfilled in goodness 
at home and abroad.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from the Senate impeachment trial Tuesday, as  
transcribed by the Federal Document Clearing House: 
</P>
<P>
	``While we have not submitted to you today the name of President  
Clinton in our motion, we strongly urge that if you allow us to 
have witnesses, which we believe you should, that you in addition 
or even if you don't, on your own, call President Clinton here to 
testify. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that it is exceedingly important that you have an  
opportunity, and we have an opportunity for you, to examine him and 
these other witnesses to get at the truth of this matter.'' -- Rep. 
Bill McCollum, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``If our motion is granted, I want to make this very, very, very  
clear: at no point will we ask any questions of Monica Lewinsky 
about her explicit sexual relations with the president, either in 
deposition or if we are permitted on the floor of the House.'' -- 
McCollum. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not see why the entire process of deposing and calling  
all of these witnesses right here live would have to take more than 
just a very few days -- two or three, four, five, maybe early next 
week at the latest. There's no reason why that has to be longer 
than that. We absolutely reject the argument that some have been 
making -- and I don't know why they've been making it -- that somehow 
if we have a single witness out here, it's going to take weeks and 
weeks of protracted delay in this trial.'' -- McCollum. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to use your common sense to get at this. Seeing,  
hearing, observing those live witnesses is important.'' -- McCollum. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``All you need to convict is to accept Monica Lewinsky had no  
motive to lie about this, the president did, and you have to draw 
the inferences you logically can from the chain of events that are 
in this record.'' -- McCollum. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is the perjury of the president in this case  
is as plain as day on the record and we don't need to call any 
witnesses on this matter.'' -- McCollum. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Any courtroom where you're going to certainly judge something  
beyond a reasonable doubt, you need to assess the credibility of 
the witnesses where you have conflicting testimony.'' -- McCollum. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Ms. Lewinsky is probably the most important witness left. And  
wouldn't you at least like to see and hear from her on this? As 
triers of fact, wouldn't you want to observe the demeanor of Ms. 
Lewinsky and test her credibility?'' -- Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Ms. Lewinsky, if truth be known, probably does not want to  
come in here and testify. These are not our witnesses. We didn't 
get this case in a brown envelope, but we certainly didn't have any 
choice in selecting the witnesses. The witnesses are all out there 
are basically White House employees, friends of the White House or 
former employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are not going to be our friends if they come in and  
testify. They are not going to be sympathetic to us, although we 
would anticipate that they would tell the truth. And that certainly 
would be our belief with Ms. Lewinsky if she were called. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe she understands her responsibility, despite any  
feelings that she might have about the president or the job that 
he's doing as president, that she understands this responsibility 
to tell the truth.'' -- Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The president not only committed himself to illegal actions,  
but he enlisted others to assist, some knowingly and others perhaps 
unknowingly. And Ms. Lewinsky is one of these who interestingly 
enough might fit into both categories of knowing and unknowingly at 
different times, and she would be able to share with this Senate 
the so-called tone and tenor of her conversations with the 
president.'' -- Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The story needs to be told. The truth should be determined.  
Justice should be accomplished. That is done not through lawyers up 
here talking, it's done not through transcripts, but through 
witnesses.'' -- Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Members of this body, we suggest that the evidence has shown  
and the evidence will further show by the calling of the witnesses 
that we propose that the president denied under oath specific facts 
that were relevant to the case, relevant to the Jones case, 
relevant to perjury and obstruction, the perjury and obstruction 
investigation of the grand jury, and in so doing, among the other 
lies that my colleagues have pointed out, we will show that he lied 
to his aides.'' -- Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif.

<HEADLINE> Miller To Test Market New Beer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Miller Brewing Co. will begin testing a new  
light beer brand, Icehouse Light, early next month in five markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's second biggest brewer said Monday the brand will be  
sold in Raleigh, N.C.; Athens, Ga.; Savannah, Ga.; Orlando, Fla., 
and Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller decided to test consumer reaction to Icehouse Light  
because of the success of its Icehouse brand, said company 
spokesman Peter Marino. 
</P>
<P>
	Icehouse's sales volume in 1998 increased 13.1 percent to just  
over 2 million barrels, Marino said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ice-brewing process drops the temperature of beer to the  
freezing point, forming ice crystals. At that point, proteins and 
other chemicals are removed from the beer, leaving a brew with a 
different taste and a higher alcohol content than regular beer.

<HEADLINE> Drug Makers Post Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Amid growing worldwide demand for drugs, four of  
the nation's biggest pharmaceutical firms -- Merck, American Home 
Products, Schering-Plough and Johnson &AMP; Johnson -- matched or 
slightly surpassed Wall Street expectations, according to company 
reports released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings growth was fueled by sales of several established  
drugs, including Schering-Plough's allergy medication Claritin and 
Merck's high-blood pressure medications Cozaar and Hyzaar. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck, the world's largest drug company, led the way in sales  
growth with a 21 percent jump in the fourth quarter. 
Schering-Plough led profit growth, with a 22 percent surge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall the operating environment for Big Pharma is pretty  
solid worldwide,'' said Alex Zisson, analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; 
Quist. ``Most companies are showing high quality sales growth 
without a lot of price increases.'' 

</P>
<P>
 *Merck &AMP; Co.    	
</P>
<P>
	Merck &AMP; Co.'s profits climbed 13 percent in the fourth quarter,  
driven by continued strong sales of its cholesterol and high blood 
pressure drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The pharmaceutical company reported it earned $1.4 billion, or  
$1.16 per share, matching Wall Street expectations. In the same 
quarter of 1997, Merck earned $1.24 billion, or $1.01 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the quarter were $7.5 billion, up 21 percent from  
$6.23 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck's established products, including the cholesterol-lowering  
drug Zocor (up 11 percent), hypertension drug Prinivil (up 15 
percent) and osteoporosis drug Fosamax (up 44 percent) pushed sales 
higher. But Mevacor, another cholesterol drug, slipped 29 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, Merck's profit rose 14 percent to $5.25  
billion, or $4.30 a share, from $4.61 billion, or $3.74 a share, in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the year rose 14 percent to $26.9 billion from $23.64  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Merck rose $6.50, or 5 percent, to close at $144 on  
the New York Stock Exchange. 

</P>
<P>
 *Johnson &AMP; Johnson    	
</P>
<P>
	Johnson &AMP; Johnson's profits rose 10 percent in the fourth  
quarter, driven by strong domestic drug sales, which made up for 
lagging sales of coronary stents to hospitals and anemic growth in 
its consumer products division. 
</P>
<P>
	Before special charges, the health care giant earned $693  
million, or 50 cents per share, matching Wall Street's 
expectations. In the same quarter in 1997, J&AMP;J earned $630 million, 
or 45 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth quarter, however, included a one-time charge of $610  
million to account for a major restructuring, which included 
eliminating 4,100 jobs to free up money for research and 
development. Including the special charge, J&AMP;J earned $83 million, 
or 44 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the fourth quarter were $6.4 billion, a 13.1 percent  
increase over sales of $5.6 billion for the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, J&AMP;J earned $3.7 billion, or $2.67 per share,  
compared to $3.3 billion, or $2.41 per share, in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide sales for 1998 were $23.7 billion, an increase of 4.5  
percent over 1997 sales of $22.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	J&AMP;J's worldwide drug sales increased 11.3 percent in 1998 to  
$8.6 billion. Among J&AMP;J's top selling drugs were Risperdal, an 
antipsychotic medication and Procrit, an anemia medication. 
</P>
<P>
	J&AMP;J's medical device division saw sales increase just 1.6  
percent to $8.6 billion, due to declining stent sales. Coronary 
stents help prop open clogged arteries after angioplasty. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of J&AMP;J rose $3.75 to $82.50 in New York Stock Exchange  
trading. 

</P>
<P>
 *American Home Products    	
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products, maker of Robitussin cough syrup and  
Advil pain reliever, saw profits increase 3 percent in the fourth 
quarter, not counting a big restructuring charge. But worldwide 
drug sales dropped by 6 percent due to the discontinuation of 
several products and competition from generics. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding special charges, the company earned $590.12 million in  
the fourth quarter, or 44 cents per share. Analysts surveyed by 
First Call Corp. expected the company to earn 43 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home took a one-time restructuring charge of $240.5

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors Want To See Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors pleaded with the Senate on  
Tuesday to issue subpoenas for ``a pitiful three'' impeachment 
trial witnesses -- Monica Lewinsky and two others -- and to request 
that President Clinton answer questions under oath. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Senate went behind closed doors to debate the witness  
issue, the White House said Clinton has no intention of submitting 
to questioning, even if confronted with a request for it. ``It's 
time to wrap this up,'' presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said of 
the trial, in its third week. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyers, joined by Senate Democrats, also warned that  
the issuance of subpoenas for depositions from Ms. Lewinsky, 
presidential friend Vernon Jordan and White House aide Sidney 
Blumenthal would raise the possibility of long delays in the 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	But senators in both parties, emerging from the three-hour  
closed-door session, said revived negotiations were under way on a 
bipartisan timetable for a final vote on the articles of 
impeachment by the middle of next month -- after witnesses are 
deposed on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	``The procedural aspects, after the votes go forward, the  
process by which witnesses would be deposed and so on'' are the 
focus of the talks, said Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	One Democratic official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,  
said it was possible the White House would be asked if it wanted 
any witnesses deposed, and they, too, would be added to the list 
under a compressed timetable that envisioned a final vote on 
Clinton's fate within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Democrat, Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, said it was  
possible the votes scheduled for Wednesday would be scrapped, 
although others said that was unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most senators in both parties do not want to make the same  
mistakes the House did'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., referring 
to the partisan impeachment brawl that developed there. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky, summoned to Washington over the weekend to be  
interviewed by the House prosecutors, checked out of her hotel and 
flew home to California. Her lawyer said she would return if 
ordered to answer further questions. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors said they had trimmed their list to pass Senate  
muster. ``A pitiful three, and I would think you would want to 
proceed with that minimum testimony,'' said Rep. Henry Hyde, the 
lead prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic leader Tom Daschle conceded that the Republicans,  
with a 55-45 majority, were likely to prevail when the roll is 
called on Wednesday, forcing approval of subpoenas for Ms. 
Lewinsky, Jordan and Blumenthal. ``I think it's going to be 
virtually a party-line vote, unfortunately,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for questioning Clinton, he added, ``That's a red herring. It  
is not going anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All witnesses would be questioned under oath at private  
depositions about the facts concerning allegations of perjury and 
obstruction of justice by the president in connection with his 
efforts to conceal a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
Guidelines for the questioning remain to be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's closed-door Senate session was the second in as many  
nights. As was the case on Monday, a request by Democratic Sens. 
Tom Harkin of Iowa and Paul Wellstone of Minnesota to open the 
doors was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	The winnowed list of three witnesses marked a concession by the  
House prosecutors, who were fearful that a more extensive request 
would cost them the support of wavering Republicans and seal the 
defeat of their effort for testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're down from thinking we ought to have 10, 12, maybe 15  
witnesses, to three,'' Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida said during a 
four-hour legal argument on the Senate floor during the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Hyde: ``We have a good case, we have an excellent case  
without the witnesses, but the witnesses help you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's lawyers and Democratic allies reacted with a  
mixture of scorn and warnings, knowing that public opinion polls 
favor a swift end to the trial and that Clinton's acquittal on 
charges of perjury and obstruction of justice is virtually assured. 
</P>
<P>
	``The time to end the trial is now, and the correct number of  
witnesses is zero,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts told 
reporters in an interview off the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	From the lectern stationed in the well of the chamber, lead  
Clinton attorney David Kendall said the House had yet to prove its 
case. He likened the prosecutors to a blackjack player betting 
against long odds. ``Here, they're simply gambling. ... I think it 
has no place in the impeachment trial here when the fate of the 
president is at stake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The day's events set the stage for a pair of showdown votes on  
Wednesday, first on a proposal by Democratic Sen. Robert C. Byrd of 
West Virginia to dismiss all charges and bring the trial to an end, 
then on the call for depositions. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd's proposal is widely expected to fail, by a party-line vote  
or more. Democratic officials have expressed concern that they may 
suffer defections from two or three members of their caucus, 
including Sens. Russell Feingold of Wisconsin, Bob Graham of 
Florida and possibly John Edwards of North Carolina, in office less 
than a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The second vote would take place on the call for subpoenas only,  
meaning that the Senate will not vote, for the time being at least, 
on whether to request that Clinton submit to a deposition. Majority 
Leader Trent Lott has labored behind the scenes to make sure GOP 
defections don't doom the proposal for subpoenas. 
</P>
<P>
	If the proposal is approved, the Senate still would have to  
resolve numerous details about the subpoenas, as well as grapple 
with White House demands for an extensive time to review records 
not previously made available to the president's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	With Republicans professing eagerness to wrap up the trial  
quickly, Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., circulated proposed ground rules 
at a closed-door GOP caucus. They would call for each witness to be 
deposed for a maximum of four hours, two hours for the House and 
two hours for the president's lawyers. Witnesses could be 
questioned only about areas of factual dispute. The sessions would 
be videotaped for senators to view. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the depositions, the Senate would decide whether to  
approve live testimony in the well of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's spokesman, John Czwartacki, said the Mississippi  
Republican hopes the depositions can be wrapped up by early next 
week. GOP officials also said Lott had mentioned a possibility 
during a closed-door caucus of having the Senate vote on a 
non-binding resolution declaring that Clinton had committed perjury 
and obstruction of justice, even though he would hold onto his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, Daschle said Democrats would insist that  
Clinton be treated fairly if witnesses were deposed. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to being entitled to depose the witnesses, Daschle  
said the White House should have access to 54,000 pages in the 
record it has yet to see, as well as voluminous documents assembled 
by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. In addition, he said, the 
``White House itself may want to call witnesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors want to question Jordan, an attorney and longtime  
Clinton friend, about his efforts to find Ms. Lewinsky a job at the 
same time she had been subpoenaed in the Paula Jones sexual 
harassment case against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal, who is close to first lady Hillary Clinton, is one  
of the White House aides to whom the president falsely denied 
having had a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. The article of 
impeachment alleging obstruction of justice says Clinton lied to 
his aides so they would pass on the false information to the grand 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, House prosecutors also asked permission to  
introduce three pieces of evidence that weren't in the official 
House impeachment record used so far during the trial.

<HEADLINE> The Duchess of York at Fund-Raiser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Sarah Ferguson sees the silver lining in  
the day she confronted her own weight problem: It pointed out the 
need for her to speak out about women's health. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a subject that's often pushed to one side, especially for  
women,'' the duchess of York told about 350 people at a 
fund-raising luncheon Tuesday. She said many women, especially in 
underdeveloped countries, are so busy working and raising families 
that they neglect their health. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson's visit helped raise money for the Ohio State  
University Medical Center's Spirit of Women Park, which is to open 
next year. She spent the day talking with nursing and 
health-science students and touring the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The duchess also painted a ceramic tile that will be part of a  
fountain at the hospital. The mother of two girls then gave

tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift. To my little 
darlings.''

<HEADLINE> FDA To Curbs Animal Antibiotics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government plans to impose strict new  
rules on antibiotics given to farm animals to combat concerns that 
the medicines are creating drug-resistant germs that wind up in the 
meat people eat. 
</P>
<P>
	Antibiotics are fast losing their ability to fight infections,  
mostly because people misuse the vital drugs: Doctors often 
overprescribe them and patients often don't take them properly. 
</P>
<P>
	But scientists say antibiotics used on the farm now are causing  
foodborne bacteria to mutate into treatment-resistant forms -- so 
the Food and Drug Administration is preparing rules to try to curb 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an issue that won't go away and can no longer be  
ignored,'' said Michigan veterinarian Keith Sterner, who chaired a 
panel of FDA's advisers that backed most of the agency's plans 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The advisory committee said FDA's plan to force antibiotic  
manufacturers to conduct on-the-farm testing of drug resistance 
probably would never work. But overall, the FDA has proposed ``a 
sound framework'' of more strict animal drug regulation, Sterner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A two-day meeting to deliberate the FDA's proposals highlighted  
how bitter a controversy the issue is. On one side, the animal drug 
industry denies there is any serious risk to consumers, noting that 
no one has died from eating meat tainted with untreatable germs. On 
the other side, public health experts say they must act to protect 
consumers from that ever happening. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics ``never stood at the bedside of a critically ill patient  
... hoping the antibiotics will work and having to deal with the 
consequences when they don't,'' said Dr. David Bell of the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention. He pleaded with the industry to 
find a compromise that protects consumers while still providing 
farmers with drugs vital for animal health. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers adamantly oppose many of FDA's plans, saying the  
rules would make it too difficult -- and expensive -- to create new 
antibiotics for animals. They argued that the government instead 
should study whether on-the-farm antibiotics really pose an 
imminent threat, and educate farmers and veterinarians to more 
prudently use the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the agency is overreacting,'' said Dr. Brendan Fox,  
president of Elanco Animal Health. 
</P>
<P>
	That prompted a fierce reaction from one of FDA's advisors: ``If  
there is no risk, you shouldn't be afraid of'' the FDA's rules, 
said CDC's Dr. Frederick Angulo. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost half the 50 million pounds of U.S.-produced antibiotics  
is used in animals. Eighty percent is used, not to treat sick 
animals, but to promote animals' growth by adding small doses into 
their feed. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, Europe has drawn the ire of the animal health industry  
by banning six antibiotics used as animal growth promoters, 
including one closely related to the vital human antibiotic 
vancomycin. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the FDA's proposals to tackle the issue:  
</P>
<P>
	--Companies seeking to sell a new animal antibiotic would have to  
prove it is not expected to cause significant resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	--The government would test today's level of foodborne drug  
resistance, and then set limits on how much resistance could 
increase before an implicated animal antibiotic would be 
restricted, even banned. 
</P>
<P>
	--FDA would rank animal drugs, giving those most closely related  
to vital human antibiotics extra scrutiny. Some companies might be 
ordered to conduct on-the-farm animal tests. 
</P>
<P>
	FDA advisers said Tuesday that on-the-farm testing may be too  
complicated to ever work, but agreed with most of FDA's approach. 
Sterner stressed that animal antibiotics closely related to vital 
human drugs would have ``a zero threshold'' for increasing 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA will decide which rules to adopt after a public comment  
period ends in April.

<HEADLINE> Wall St. Stocks End Mixed / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Big-name stocks and technology issues rose for a  
second straight day Tuesday as some high-profile companies 
announced stock splits, dividend increases and earnings that met or 
exceeded expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 121.26 to 9,324.58,  
leaving it 318 points shy of its closing record of 9,643.32 on Jan. 
8. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index rose 64.10 to 2,433.41, and the  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite index rose 18.33 to 1,252.31. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's rally was largely confined to well-known companies.  
Declining issues ran even with advancers on the New York Stock 
Exchange, where volume was heavy at 1.08 billion shares, up from 
Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Some individual index components shone. The Dow was led higher  
by IBM, whose shares rose 3 5/8 to 185 5/8 after the company confirmed 
Monday's rumors that it would split, exchanging two shares for each 
one held by investors. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM was joined by another Dow component, McDonald's, which also  
announced a two-for-one split and raised its dividend. McDonald's 
stock rose 3 1/16 to 78 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wall Street has splits on its brain here,'' said Larry  
Wachtel, Prudential Securities' market strategist. 
</P>
<P>
	In a stock split, a company increases the number of shares  
outstanding without increasing its total market value. A share 
valued at $100, for example, might be exchanged for two shares 
valued at $50, or three shares worth $33.33 apiece. Stock splits 
are usually undertaken to make expensive shares more affordable. 
</P>
<P>
	Many investors interpret splits as an indication that a company  
believes its already-expensive stock will go even higher, although 
that doesn't always happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's two pieces of paper for one piece of paper, and yet it's  
embraced, it's loved, it's wonderful,'' Wachtel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, earnings reports boosted drug makers, including Dow  
components Merck and Johnson &AMP; Johnson, which both met analysts' 
fourth-quarter estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Johnson &AMP; Johnson took a smaller-than-expected  
restructuring charge, and company officials said it would seek 
approval for its new cholesterol-lowering margarine, which it hopes 
to have on the market this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck rose 6 1/2 to 144, and Johnson &AMP; Johnson gained 3 3/4 to 82 1/2.  
</P>
<P>
	On the down side, Coca-Cola, another Dow stock, dropped 3/8 to  
62 5/8. The soft drink company reported an expected 27 percent drop in 
fourth-quarter profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow component Boeing beat fourth-quarter earnings expectations,  
but its stock fell 1 to 35 after the aircraft and defense equipment 
maker said pricing pressures would hurt earnings this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Xerox announced it had met analysts' fourth-quarter earnings  
goals and that it would raise its dividend and split its stock two 
for one. Xerox shares shot up 10 15/16 to 116 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, technology stocks continued to move higher. Microsoft  
shares climbed 9 11/16 to 171 9/16 in Nasdaq trading after that 
company declared a stock split Monday. Compaq advanced 2 5/8 to 49 1/4, 
after the computer maker said it will spin off its Alta Vista 
online search service into a separate, publicly traded company. 
</P>
<P>
	While anything even remotely connected with technology has been  
soaring lately, Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis at 
A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis, said the rest of the market 
was trading on a name-by-name basis. 
</P>
<P>
	He favors sectors that he believes will be able to post better  
earnings this year, which includes technology but also includes 
health care, financial services and energy companies. 
</P>
<P>
	But Goldman said it will be increasingly difficult this year to  
find patterns. ``I think it's going to be an eclectic market,'' he 
said. ``Consumer nondurables should be going up, but cyclicals will 
go up as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 5.39 to 591.45, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.35 to 706.36. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.22 to 425.33. 
</P>
<P>
	On overseas stock markets, Tokyo's Nikkei stock index gained  
1.22 percent. The London and Frankfurt exchanges posted tiny gains, 
while the CAC in Paris rose 0.51 percent.

<HEADLINE> Sixers' Iverson Close to $71M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Charles Barkley once called him Allen ``Me,  
Myself and Iverson.'' His sneakers are called the Question, the 
Answer and the Answer II. 
</P>
<P>
	The Answer III comes in the form of a $70.9 million, six-year  
contract extension that Allen Iverson was close to signing Tuesday 
with the Philadelphia 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
	If not for the lockout, Iverson's deal might have surpassed the  
mega-contracts signed by players like Kevin Garnett, Shawn Kemp and 
Antonio McDyess. Instead, the negotiations were reduced to a 
formality. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the contract is signed, Iverson will get the maximum for a  
player entering his third season in the league, a team source who 
asked not to be identified told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson's agent, David Falk, was en route to Philadelphia for an  
announcement planned for Tuesday night pending completion of the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to wait until the end of the year and then  
decide whether to play for a contender,'' Iverson said. ``I never 
wanted to take the easy way out. I've been here through the bad 
times, I want to be here through the good. I pretty much knew what 
time it was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson's contract is the largest ever guaranteed by the Sixers,  
hurtling this 23-year-old enigma past the likes of Julius Erving, 
Wilt Chamberlain and Barkley. But Iverson's chance to strike it 
super-rich with a $100 million contract was wiped out by the 
lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the NBA's new collective bargaining agreement, a  
player with up to six years experience can receive as much as 25 
percent of his team's salary cap, beginning at a maximum of $9 
million. Iverson will get $9 million next season with annual raises 
of $1.1 million. He will make $14.6 million in the final year of 
the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	His 1998-99 salary of $3.5 million is prorated for a 50-game  
schedule, reducing it to $2.2 million -- a loss of more than $1.3 
million due to the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to make enough money to take care of my  
family,'' Iverson said. ``The money that's out there for me right 
now is enough for me to do so. If the Sixers were going to give me 
$100 million, I would be a fool not to take it. I have a family and 
I want to know how my future's going to look financially. But it's 
not all about money all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson is feared for his speed and crossover dribble, yet  
criticized for ongoing legal problems and judged on his appearance 
and choice of friends. Along with incredible skill and 
competitiveness, he brings a street-kid look to the court with his 
braids, jewelry and tattoos running up and down each arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Emblazoned in old English script on his right shoulder are the  
words, ``Hold my own.'' Critics can say what they want, but Iverson 
nearly always does that. With Michael Jordan retired, the coming 
years may prove that the best attraction in the NBA is Iverson -- 
mesmerizing defenders with his quickness and daring cameras to 
capture his relentless drives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to win the most championships,'' Iverson said, ``and I  
want to be the best player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But two weeks ago, legal problems haunted him again.  
Mercedes-Benz Credit Corp. sued Iverson for more than $28,500 in 
unpaid lease payments on three late-model cars. The suit also asks 
for the return of the cars and for the total buyout amount, about 
$300,000, on the 24-month lease vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know until the article came out,'' Iverson said. ``It  
was something that my accountant was supposed to handle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Sixers president Pat Croce was willing to let his  
championship hopes rest with Iverson, he still worries about him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's young, and I know he's giving of himself and of his  
riches to his friends and family to a fault,'' Croce said. ``So I 
always worry about him, because he's not someone who will say no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Iverson had waited until July 1, he could have negotiated  
with any team for a seven-year contract worth more than $86 
million. But he said he wants to stay in Philadelphia, despite his 
past grievances with coach Larry Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just had to mature,'' Iverson said. ``I realized that he was  
a great coach when I looked at his resume. It was important for me 
to put my pride aside and listen to what was said to me as a 
positive. I was just young, I had to do a lot of growing up.''

<HEADLINE> ESPN Says Simpson One of Century's Top Athletes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRISTOL, Conn. (AP) -- ESPN will air a 30-minute documentary  
honoring O.J. Simpson as one of the 50 greatest North American 
athletes of the 20th century. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN said Monday that the special, to be broadcast Friday, will  
make note of the allegations that Simpson killed his ex-wife, 
Nicole Brown Simpson, and a companion, Ronald Goldman. Although 
acquitted of criminal charges, Simpson was found liable for their 
deaths in a separate civil proceeding, a decision he is appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	Panelists voting on the 50 greatest athletes were asked to  
consider athletic prowess alone, the network said. ESPN also said 
nearly 60 percent of ESPN Web site users said they believed Simpson 
was one of the greatest athletes of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those interviewed for the Simpson program was former  
National Football League defensive end Deacon Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing he did outside the game has anything to do with his  
contributions to the sport, not one iota,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson, the Heisman Trophy winner in his senior year at the  
University of Southern California, had an 11-year professional 
football career.

<HEADLINE> Two Killed in School Bus Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A bus carrying students home from two  
elementary schools apparently ran a stop sign and crashed into a 
tractor-trailer, killing an 8-year-old boy and the truck driver. 
</P>
<P>
	Students were tossed around inside the bus as it flipped onto  
its side during Monday afternoon's crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like (the bus driver) didn't see the stop sign,'' said  
Rebecca Clark, 23, who was driving behind the truck. ``It's the 
worst thing I ever saw.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The boy, Victor Dixon, and Sammie Hughes, 63, were killed. The  
bus driver, Deborah Colletti, 37, was in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	One child was injured critically, while 14 other students  
suffered injuries ranging from cuts and bruises to concussions. 
Seven were admitted to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Police believed as many as 25 students were on the bus, but  
school officials said it was around 18. Some children were removed 
through escape hatches while others were cut from the crumpled 
remains of the bus. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to thank God that it wasn't worse and that my  
children are going to be OK,'' said Ken Douds, whose son, Joshua, 
and daughter, Kirsten, were badly bruised.

<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Spike Lee urged students to do as he says -- and  
not necessarily as he did as an undergraduate at Morehouse College 
in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech titled ``Minorities in Films,'' the film director  
told students at Milwaukee Area Technical College they should get 
serious about their studies. 
</P>
<P>
	``At Morehouse, I took all my electives during the first two  
years, until they said to me, `You've got to come up with a 
major,''' Lee said Monday. He chose mass communications. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee hit it big as a filmmaker but said making money isn't  
everything. 
</P>
<P>
	``I go to bed every night singing praises for being able to do

<HEADLINE> St. Louis Welcomes the Pope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Downtown St. Louis became a giant block party  
on Tuesday as revelers gave Pope John Paul II an all-day Midwestern 
welcome and thousands poured into town for a chance to celebrate 
and pray. 
</P>
<P>
	A parade of thousands of young people snaked two miles from the  
Gateway Arch on the banks of the Mississippi River to the Kiel 
Center, site of a youth rally attended by the pope Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a chance to renew our spirituality,'' said Marie DeWolf,  
a teen-ager who took part in the parade. ``And to actually get the 
chance to see him!'' 
</P>
<P>
	As she spoke, chants and cheers rang out all around and  
helicopters whirled overhead. 
</P>
<P>
	At the city's Plaza Square, which was renamed Papal Plaza just  
for the day, the faithful who had traveled all night to be in St. 
Louis for the pope's 30-hour visit sprawled out on the grass, 
hoping to catch a few hours of sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	Bands played and vendors hawked papal memorabilia.  
</P>
<P>
	``Souvenirs! Get your pope souvenirs!'' yelled Joseph Prince,  
his voice reduced to a hoarse whisper after hours of shouting. He 
added, ``God bless you,'' to anyone who bought a button or flag 
with the pope's picture on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Many said the town hadn't been this charged up since St. Louis  
Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire's 70-home run season ended a few 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``First we had McGwire hitting all those home runs. Now we have  
the pope,'' said 81-year-old Margaret Wilson, sitting in a folding 
chair along the parade route. ``I don't know what we're going to do 
for excitement after this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parts of the city seemed totally abandoned, as businesses shut  
and people heeded warnings not to drive into town. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Park, who had traveled with fellow students from  
Franciscan University in Steubenville, Ohio, said the pope was an 
inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Holy Father exudes an aura of holiness and truth that  
makes us realize there is something missing in our lives without 
God,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Park said he hoped providence in the form of someone with an  
extra ticket would get him in to Kiel Arena for the youth rally. 
</P>
<P>
	He sprinted off when he heard one of his traveling companions  
shout the answer to his prayers from just outside the arena door: 
``C'mon, Peter, we've got 'em. We got the tickets.''

<HEADLINE> The Superstars Nobody Wanted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Leave it to Jamal Anderson, the NFL's most  
media-savvy superstar to put into words what Terrell Davis has 
meant to scores of NFL players who wait and wait on draft day to 
hear their names called. 
</P>
<P>
	``Terrell,'' Anderson says, ``has kind of carried the flag for  
the unwanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Unwanted'' is how the Falcons like to portray themselves.  
Their press release for the Super Bowl proudly flaunts all the 
times their players and coaches have been cut or fired. 
</P>
<P>
	And Atlanta players, revving up their us-against-the-world  
engines, are programmed to tell people that they have only two 
first-round draft choices in their starting lineups -- offensive 
tackle Bob Whitfield and linebacker Cornelius Bennett, who landed 
in Atlanta three seasons ago as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	But the real showpieces for imperfection in the NFL's draft  
process are the two running backs in Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, last season's Super Bowl MVP, this season's league MVP  
and just the fourth back in history to run for more than 2,000 
yards, was taken in the sixth round by Denver in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, whose 1,846 yards were second to Davis, was taken in  
the seventh round a year earlier by Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	How did that happen?  
</P>
<P>
	Simple.  
</P>
<P>
	A fullback and nose guard at San Diego's Lincoln High School,  
Davis first went to Long Beach State and then to Georgia. While 
there, he got caught in a passing offense, then got hurt and didn't 
have a chance to show his potential until the postseason college 
all-star games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on what he did in the Senior Bowl, we figured he'd be a  
third-round choice,'' coach Mike Shanahan says. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we thought we were pretty well fixed at running back so we  
didn't take him then. By the sixth round, everyone we liked was off 
the board. We had him ranked higher, so we said `what the heck' and 
took him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, whose father who runs a security service for boxers  
and entertainers, went to Utah, where pro scouts considered him a 
little small for a fullback and a little slow for a tailback. So he 
lasted until the seventh round, a little too early for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the fourth round, I'd hoped to be a free agent because  
then I could choose my own team, one that needed a running back,'' 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he landed in Atlanta, where running backs were an  
afterthought in a run-and-shoot offense. 
</P>
<P>
	None of that stopped Anderson.  
</P>
<P>
	In training camp his rookie year, he drew an arrow pointing  
upwards on a depth chart that listed him fifth at running back. By 
his third season he was starting. 
</P>
<P>
	When Dan Reeves arrived last season, he installed an offense  
with a featured running back, and in no time at all Anderson had 
his second straight 1,000-yard season. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' success came more quickly.  
</P>
<P>
	``I remember his first day at minicamp. His pants hung down to  
his butt and he looked a little lost,'' says Gary Kubiak, the 
Broncos' offensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	But he impressed coaches running under punts on special teams,  
and by opening day he was a starter, beating out the guys Shanahan 
already had -- Aaron Craver, Rod Bernstine and Glyn Milburn. None is 
with the Broncos now. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, meanwhile, has averaged 105.1 yards a game in his first  
four seasons -- the best in NFL history and almost a yard better 
than the 104.3 by Jim Brown, the only other player with a career 
average over 100. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson's recognition finally came this season when the  
Falcons, who had never reached an NFL championship game in their 32 
seasons, won the NFC West with a 14-2 record then beat San 
Francisco and upset Minnesota to reach the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson is still known as much for his ``Dirty Bird'' dance, an  
arm-flapping post-touchdown routine, as he is for his running. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't really invent it,'' he says, then pauses. ``Well, I  
did. But I did it in the New Orleans game, which was televised to 5 
percent of the nation, and then O.J. Santiago did it in New 
England. That went to 60 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, again illustrating his media savvy, Anderson compared his  
image to Santiago in terms of the Jacksons, one of his father's 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was kind of like Jermaine,'' Anderson said, referring to  
Santiago, the Falcons' tight end. ``I'm like Michael.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When you succeed as a seventh-round draft choice, you don't have  
to be humble.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola Reports Lower Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Coca-Cola Co.'s profit fell 27 percent for the  
fourth quarter and 14 percent for all of 1998 as overseas economic 
problems took a toll on the huge soft drink company. 
</P>
<P>
	Its stock price sank even though the decline had been  
anticipated on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported Tuesday it earned $597 million, or 24 cents  
per share, in the October-December period, down from $817 million, 
or 33 cents per share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey by First Call Inc. showed analysts had expected  
earnings of 24 cents per share for Coke's fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Coca-Cola shares  
closed down 37 1/2 cents at $62.56 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke's revenues for the quarter were $4.5 billion, down 5  
percent from $4.7 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke Chairman M. Douglas Ivester advised Wall Street analysts  
last month that the company expected earnings of 24 cents to 25 
cents per share for the quarter, compared with analyst estimates at 
that time of 30 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Coke's net income was $3.53 billion, or $1.42 per  
diluted share, down from $4.13 billion, or $1.64 per diluted share, 
in 1997. The 1997 results included after-tax gains of 22 cents per 
share resulting mainly from bottling transactions. The 1998 results 
included 2 cents per share in after-tax gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Annual revenue were $18.81 billion, down slightly from $18.87 in  
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola has been hurt by the Asian currency crisis and the  
economic downturn also hitting Russia and parts of Europe, Africa 
and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	``This past year has been a challenging period for the Coca-Cola  
Co. as economic slowdowns in several key markets had a short-term 
impact, slowing volume growth and affecting our earnings,'' said 
Ivester. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivester said even though the global economic environment became  
``more uncertain and volatile'' last year, the company strengthened 
its worldwide bottling system over the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our business remains very healthy throughout the world, and  
during the past year we increased or maintained our share position 
in every operating group around the world,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said its 1998 worldwide case volume, an important  
industry indicator measuring sales of units of 24 eight-ounce 
servings, was up 6 percent to nearly 16 billion cases. It was the 
44th consecutive year of case volume growth.

<HEADLINE> 'Asterix and Obelix' Now a Movie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Asterix and Obelix, the Gallic warriors loved by  
comic book fans worldwide, are about to come to life in the most 
expensive film in French history. 
</P>
<P>
	While the word ``blockbuster'' is not usually associated with  
French movies, with a $48 million price tag, ``Asterix and Obelix 
Versus Caesar'' could redefine this country's cinema. 
</P>
<P>
	``Asterix'' has all the blockbuster ingredients in abundance:  
plenty of money, big stars and state-of-the-art special effects. 
</P>
<P>
	A week before director Claude Zidi's film is unleashed on the  
French public, the wheels on an intense promotional campaign are 
turning quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-producers TFI, a privately owned French TV network, and Renn  
Productions, run by film director Claude Berri, have a combined 
marketing budget of $446,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Shops are already overflowing with T-shirts, sweatshirts and  
scarves, and Asterix and Obelix dolls are likely to follow. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent issue of Paris Match magazine published 14 pages of  
photos featuring the film's stars: Gerard Depardieu; Italian actor 
Roberto Benigni; and Laetitia Casta, often called the new Brigitte 
Bardot. 
</P>
<P>
	The film is the first live action feature after several animated  
stories of the diminutive Asterix and his rotund pal, Obelix. 
</P>
<P>
	In the comic book series, their village, in the ancient region  
of Gaul, is the only one conquered by Julius Caesar. Men of simple 
pleasures, their aims are to bash as many Romans and devour as much 
roast boar as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1961, more than 150 million Asterix books, created by  
writer R. Goscinny and illustrator A. Uderzo, have been printed in 
more than 54 languages and dialects. 
</P>
<P>
	The film is due out in France on Feb. 3, and not long after in  
Italy, Germany, Greece, Switzerland, Belgium and Canada. There is 
no news yet of a distributor in the United States or England. 
</P>
<P>
	If all goes well, with 30 more installments to their story,  
Asterix and his friends could be around well into the new 
millennium.

<HEADLINE>  Brazil's Real Dips, Then Recovers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The Brazilian currency swung  
wildly Tuesday, as markets waited for a government intervention 
that never came. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's currency initially nosedived Tuesday, as traders pushed  
the Central Bank to sell dollars. The real tumbled to 1.96 to the 
dollar from 1.79 on Monday, before closing at 1.82 before dipping 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	Currency dealers said the real plummeted because buyers wanted  
to discover at what point the government would step in and sell 
dollars to prop it up. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Central Bank said it would allow the real to  
float against the dollar but might intervene to avert sudden 
changes, a system economists call a ``dirty float.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the government did just that, selling dollars through  
the federally run Banco do Brasil to halt a free fall. But there 
was no sign of intervention on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There definitely are people forcing the Central Bank's hand,''  
said one Rio de Janeiro trader speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Late in the day, several banks sold dollars when the rate was  
around 1.90 and the real bounced back up. But dealers say banks are 
almost out of dollars, which raises the demand and the pressure on 
the Central Bank to sell. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil stopped spending its dollar reserves to support the real  
after losing more than $45 billion since August, as panicky 
investors bailed out of Latin America's largest economy. 
</P>
<P>
	But dollars continue flowing out, despite a 38 percent  
devaluation of the real since Jan. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Central Bank President Francisco Lopes said $8 billion has left  
the country this month and that reserves stand at about $36 
billion, including $9 billion from a $41.5 billion aid package from 
international lenders. 
</P>
<P>
	At his confirmation hearing at the Senate, Lopes said that  
Brazil must raise money abroad this year or reserves will fall to 
$24 billion in 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopes called the current market jitters ``exaggerated'' and said  
the initial plunge of the real isn't something to worry about. He 
said there was no chance Brazil would restrict the outflow of 
dollars because foreign credit and investment would vanish. 
</P>
<P>
	``Currency controls would mean that Brazil would be abandoning  
the possibility of becoming a first-class nation,'' Lopes said. 
``Currency controls are a non-solution ... and inevitably lead a 
country to moratorium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the abrupt plunge of the real has raised fears of renewed  
inflation, for decades the scourge of Brazil's economy. The strong 
real, introduced in 1994, cut inflation from 2,700 percent to less 
than 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The government hopes to curb inflation by keeping credit tight,  
so merchants will have to cut prices to attract customers. The 
Central Bank now charges 32.5 percent interest on loans to banks. 
</P>
<P>
	But high interest rates also raise the government's public  
deficit and a domestic debt that tops 350 billion reals, now worth 
about $180 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the weaker real was good news for local stock markets, as  
foreign investors went fishing for bargains. The Sao Paulo Stock 
Exchange, Latin America's largest, closed up 6.3 percent from 
Monday's close.

was no sign of intervention on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There definitely are people forcing the Central Bank's hand,''  
said one Rio de Janeiro trader speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Late in the day, several banks sold dollars when the rate was  
around 1.90 and the real bounced back up. But dealers say banks are 
almost out of dollars, which raises the demand and the pressure on 
the Central Bank to sell. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil stopped spending its dollar reserves to support the real  
after losing more than $45 billion since August, as panicky 
investors bailed out of Latin America's largest economy. 
</P>
<P>
	But dollars continue flowing out, despite a 38 percent  
devaluation of the real since Jan. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Central Bank President Francisco Lopes said $8 billion has left  
the country this month and that reserves stand at about $36 
billion, including $9 billion from a $41.5 billion aid package from 
international lenders. 
</P>
<P>
	At his confirmation hearing at the Senate, Lopes said that  
Brazil must raise money abroad this year or reserves will fall to 
$24 billion in 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopes called the current market jitters ``exaggerated'' and said  
the initial plunge of the real isn't something to worry about. He 
said there was no chance Brazil would restrict the outflow of 
dollars because foreign credit and investment would vanish. 
</P>
<P>
	``Currency controls would mean that Brazil would be abandoning  
the possibility of becoming a first-class nation,'' Lopes said. 
``Currency controls are a non-solution ... and inevitably lead a 
country to moratorium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the abrupt plunge of the real has raised fears of renewed  
inflation, for decades the scourge of Brazil's economy. The strong 
real, introduced in 1994, cut inflation from 2,700 percent to less 
than 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The government hopes to curb inflation by keeping credit tight,  
so merchants will have to cut prices to attract customers. The 
Central Bank now charges 32.5 percent interest on loans to banks. 
</P>
<P>
	But high interest rates also raise the government's public  
deficit and a domestic debt that tops 350 billion reals, now worth 
about $180 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the weaker real was good news for local stock markets, as  
foreign investors went fishing for bargains. The Sao Paulo Stock 
Exchange, Latin America's largest, closed up 6.3 percent from 
Monday's close.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors Drive Impeachment Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Rep. Henry Hyde describes it, the House  
prosecutors in President Clinton's impeachment trial are riding a 
tiger they didn't unleash and can't get off until they are done. 
</P>
<P>
	But they've got spurs on.  
</P>
<P>
	Not that it took spurring to convince Kenneth Starr to have  
Monica Lewinsky compelled to answer questions from three of the 
Republican House prosecutors. All they had to do was ask, as they 
did, without notice to the Senate, angering Democrats and dismaying 
some Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde's team of 13 GOP managers is trying to drive the  
impeachment trial. That tends to make senators restive, but 
Republicans claim more than the majority they need to keep going on 
an uncertain course to an almost certain outcome, short of the 67 
votes to convict Clinton and expel him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors insist they are entitled to call witnesses at  
the trial, Ms. Lewinsky and others, on a list they are cutting to a 
handful, in an attempt to persuade wavering Republicans that 
testimony would not mean months more of trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think witnesses will allow us to prove our case,'' said  
Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	They also think that without them, they'll lose, although they  
do not say so openly. 
</P>
<P>
	They didn't like the deal that began the Senate trial two weeks  
ago by putting off the decision on witnesses. They pushed for 
testimony in their opening arguments and then turned to Starr to 
get their Sunday session with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	That put the impeachment case back where it began, with the  
special prosecutor who began it all, armed with Clinton's dishonest 
denials of his sexual affair with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde told the Senate that the House prosecutors were doing ``a  
constitutional duty that has been thrust upon us by the independent 
counsel statute, which is really what started this thing going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Starr did what he was supposed to do when he sent the  
House his accusations of impeachable offenses on Sept. 9. ``The 
referral came to us and we were riding the tiger,'' Hyde said. 
``You just don't dismount till you do your job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't walk away,'' he added on TV Sunday. ``We're riding a  
tiger and we can't dismount until it's finished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The image, dating from a Chinese proverb, suggests a passive  
passenger who doesn't dare to get off. That's not the role of the 
House prosecutors -- they are trying to steer and spur the process, 
to defend, Hyde said, the rule of law and to avoid telling a new 
generation of Americans that it is OK for a president to lie. 
</P>
<P>
	And the impeachment did move inexorably from Starr's starting  
point, despite political signals and Republican election setbacks, 
now despite polls that show Americans overwhelmingly want Clinton 
to serve out the two years left in his term. 
</P>
<P>
	When the impeachment case was sent to Congress, Starr's office  
said its duty was fulfilled. Starr then became the Republicans' 
chief witness against the president in the House Judiciary 
Committee. The charges of perjury and obstruction of justice on 
which the Republican House voted to impeach him were Starr's 
charges, edited to the two that passed on largely party-line votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr stepped back, although not out, as Clinton was impeached  
and his trial began, although on the day it did, he had an 
indictment returned against a witness who recanted in another phase 
of his investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the prosecutors decided on Thursday that they wanted to  
interview Ms. Lewinsky. She wouldn't do it voluntarily, and they 
had Starr go to court to force the issue under the July 28 
agreement that gave her immunity in exchange for her testimony. 
That deal entitled Starr to compel her to testify not only to his 
grand jury but in any other official proceeding he required, 
specifically including those of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr got a court order to enforce it, saying he wasn't acting  
as an agent for the House prosecutors, although they're the ones 
who asked. ``We were duty bound,'' he said. Whatever the exercise 
yielded in information, it dramatized the prosecutors' press for 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	That done, Hyde said the House wasn't getting enough respect for  
its case in the Senate, which then debated a Democratic motion for 
dismissing the charges in closed-door session Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde said the motion to dismiss amounted to a so-what brush-off  
to the House. ``I sort of feel that we have fallen short in the 
respect side because of the fact that we represent the House,'' he 
said, ``the other body, kind of blue-collar people, and we're over 
here trying to survive with our impeachment articles.''

<HEADLINE> Smithsonian Looking To Expand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Smithsonian Institution wants to buy a  
major department store site in downtown Washington and turn it into 
a national cultural center. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid will be made by Friday to the Washington Opera, said I.  
Michael Heyman, who runs the 16 museums of the Smithsonian. 
</P>
<P>
	The opera group bought the Woodward &AMP; Lothrop store, which went  
bankrupt in 1995, for $18 million with the hope of making it the 
capital's opera house. But it found the cost of refurbishing the 
building too expensive -- as much as $400 million -- and decided last 
year to sell it. 
</P>
<P>
	A winning bid for the site will be announced in mid-February.  
</P>
<P>
	Heyman, secretary of the Smithsonian, said plans call for  
spending $110 million -- none of it from the federal budget -- to buy 
and refurbish the store. The center, as planned, would contain a 
500-seat auditorium, library, art archives and space for scholars 
and interns. He did not say how much would be bid, but that the 
money would come from private sources. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would free up additional space for exhibits in the old  
Patent Office Building,'' which houses the Museum of American Art 
and the National Portrait Gallery, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Exhibits operated by the Smithsonian range from the Museum of  
African Art to the National Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
	Including the federal contribution, the Smithsonian museums and  
the Washington Zoo have a budget of $569.7 million for the 12 
months ending Sept. 30. Last year the museums had more than 31.5 
million visitors.

<HEADLINE> Shark Sighted on Pro Player Turf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- There stood Greg Norman on the smooth, lush grass,  
examining the texture and wetness of the turf. 
</P>
<P>
	He seemed ready to ask his caddie for a 6-iron, except there was  
no caddie, this was not a golf course and Norman was handling one 
of his many other jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman visited Pro Player Stadium on Tuesday long before the  
Atlanta Falcons or Denver Broncos arrived for Media Day. Norman's 
private helicopter landed outside the stadium and he was driven 
inside on -- what else? -- a golf cart. Norman then inspected the 
field for Sunday's Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The field happens to be made of grass grown at the Greg Norman  
Turf Farm in Avon Park, Fla. The base of the field is called GN-1. 
The grass is PHD rye and lesco and was designed by Joe Motz. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman, who lives in Hobe Sound, Fla., is not expected to attend  
the game because of business in his native Australia. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DAYS OF OLD:* Atlanta quarterback Steve DeBerg was Denver's  
starter and already had been in the league five years when John 
Elway arrived as a rookie. Sixteen years later, they'll face each 
other in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was, what, six or seven years older? I thought he was  
ancient,'' Elway said, recalling that 1983 season as teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	And now?  
</P>
<P>
	``Now I feel ancient,'' Elway said.  
</P>
<P>
	Before this season, DeBerg's last year as a player was 1993. He  
spent the interim as a New York Giants assistant coach, then 
accepted an invitation from Reeves to suit up again this season at 
age 44. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got nine lives,'' Elway marveled. ``He's always had the  
physical and mental attributes. And I'm sure with his coaching 
experience with the Giants, and now coming back as a player, he's 
almost like another coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GOTTA DANCE:* The Dirty Bird isn't the Falcons' only dance.  
</P>
<P>
	Whenever there's a sack, other defenders acknowledge it with the  
``Bomb Squad Salute.'' Defensive tackle Shane Dronett demonstrated 
for the TV cameras on Media Day, doing a little slide-step to his 
right and throwing his right arm over his head to point back at the 
honoree. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a lot easier than the Dirty Bird, but hasn't quite caught  
on the same way. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not upset about that,'' Dronett said. ``But we'd like to  
try to get our own thing going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Has he ever tried the Dirty Bird?  
</P>
<P>
	``I've practiced it, but only behind closed doors,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PARTY POOPER:* Atlanta linebacker Cornelius Bennett, who went  
to four consecutive Super Bowls with Buffalo, says there's an easy 
explanation why the Bills lost all four. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bills, he said, were more intent on partying than playing.  
</P>
<P>
	``What we did was cheat ourselves and Buffalo fans,'' Bennett  
said. ``We did everything we could to distract ourselves and get 
caught up with the Super Bowl hype. It's the biggest party in the 
world, and we were world-class party people. I look back now and 
think of it as wasted opportunities.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SOUP TOSS:* The NFL's top rusher may not be ready to try the  
halfback option yet. 
</P>
<P>
	It took Denver's Terrell Davis two tries to throw a football  
through a yard-wide hole in a giant soup can from about 5 yards 
away, part of a charity promotion by Campbell's Chunky soups. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the best coaching efforts of his mother, Kateree, Davis'  
first attempt glanced off the can with a thud. His second throw was 
on the mark. 
</P>
<P>
	The successful throw was worth 1 million cans in donations to  
food banks nationwide, part of the NFL's ``Tackle Your Hunger'' 
campaign. Campbell's donated 3,000 cans for every touchdown scored 
in the league this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' throw, plus one by teammate John Elway that launched the  
campaign in August, brought the total donation to 5.7 million cans. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *INTERNET FAVORITE:* Dan Reeves won an Internet fan vote for the  
league's top coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, who led Atlanta to a 14-2 regular-season and its first  
Super Bowl -- his ninth as either a player or coach -- beat 
Minnesota's Dennis Green and Denver's Mike Shanahan for the award. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves underwent quadruple bypass surgery in December and still  
hasn't assumed all of the duties he performed previously. 
</P>
<P>
	``I encourage whoever wins this award next year not to go for  
the sympathy vote and to win it on merit,'' Reeves said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Terrell Davis, the fourth player in history to run  
for more than 2,000 yards in an NFL season, shakes his head in 
wonder at the mention of Jim Brown, who never reached that 
milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen him on TV and in movies, but I've never met him,''  
the Denver running back said Tuesday. ``I've seen film on him. Jim 
Brown was a fairly large back (230 pounds) for those times. In 
fact, he was a huge back for those times. I'm a small back (210) by 
comparison for my time. But I think I run with the same 
aggressiveness he had. I try to run as hard as I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said that when he sees film of Brown, he tries to imagine  
what the NFL was like in the 1950s and '60s when Brown played. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems so long ago,'' Davis said. ``I would like to try to  
compare it to today's football and to when he played the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis also has praise for Jamal Anderson, his Atlanta  
counterpart in Sunday's Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jamal is a more patient runner, a little like Barry Sanders in  
that he can stop and go on a dime,'' Davis said. ``I'm pretty much 
one speed, but Jamal also has a little Jerome Bettis in him because 
he tries to run over people and uses a stiff arm. I think we both 
try to to be power runners. 
</P>
<P>
	``But he's definitely a better dancer,'' Davis said, referring  
to Anderson's rendition of the ``Dirty Bird.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SO LONG, JEFF:* Atlanta defensive end Chuck Smith has no love  
lost for former Falcons quarterback Jeff George. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't appreciate it when Jeff George left the Falcons and  
said he wanted to go because he wanted to play for a good team,'' 
Smith said. ``All I can say is that right now we have a better 
quarterback than Jeff George.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Chandler, of course, led Atlanta to its first Super Bowl  
and best record in team history. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *KICKING FOR 60:* Sunday's Super Bowl will have two of the four  
kickers who made field goals of 60 yards or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's Jason Elam tied Tom Dempsey's NFL record with a  
63-yarder this season, while Atlanta's Morten Andersen had a 
career-best 60-yarder, matching Steve Cox. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was fun because no one is going to be mad at you if you  
miss a 63-yard field goal,'' Elam said. ``You kind of sit back, 
relax, just try to crush it and hope it stays (on line).'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was amazed because it looked like he slipped and it still  
went in with room to spare,'' Andersen said. ``I just started 
laughing when I saw it. I was so tickled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andersen's 60-yarder came when he was with New Orleans, so it's  
not even a team record because Dempsey's 63-yarder came with the 
Saints. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DID YOU KNOW:* According to Hallmark Cards Inc., Super Bowl  
Sunday has surpassed New Year's Eve as the top occasion for at-home 
parties, and according to the American Institute of Food 
Distribution, it's No. 2 behind Thanksgiving for food consumption. 
</P>
<P>
	The average number of people attending a Super Bowl party is 17,  
and only 5 percent of viewers of the game watch alone, Hallmark 
said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BRITISH BETTORS:* London-based oddsmakers, Ladbroke Group Inc.,  
quoted Tuesday through their American spokesperson odds of 2-7 for 
the Denver Broncos to win the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``American football enthusiasts around the world are looking to  
the Broncos to win another Super Bowl championship,'' Sean Boyce, 
Ladbrokes' deputy chief oddsmaker said. ``It seems that every year 
there is broadened interest in the Super Bowl, with punters 
devouring advance preliminary information from both electronic and 
print media.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ladbrokes is quoting Atlanta to win at 5-2. On a handicap basis,  
the Broncos are 5-6. The Falcons are 7 1/2-point underdogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ladbrokes is well known for its side bets that range from total  
points scored of 10 or less at 125-1 and 40-1 for 91 to 100 points. 
It is 4-7 for Denver to be ahead at both the half and for the full 
game. For Atlanta to be in front at both the half and full game, 
Ladbrokes is quoting 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first scoring play, it's 6-4 for a Denver touchdown and  
5-2 for an Atlanta touchdown, with 10-3 for a field goal by either 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	To score the first touchdown, Ladbrokes is quoting twenty  
players, with Broncos running back Terrell Davis at 7-2 and Denver 
tight end Dwayne Carswell at 66-1. Denver quarterback John Elway, 
Atlanta tight end Brian Kozlowski, Broncos running back Derek 
Loville and Falcons wide receiver and kick returner Tim Dwight are 
all listed at 25-1.

<HEADLINE> Most Polled Oppose Trial Witnesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A majority of Americans do not support the  
Senate calling witnesses in President Clinton's impeachment trial 
and an even greater number believe he will not be removed from 
office, according to a poll released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, by the Pew Research Center for the People and the  
Press, shows that 53 percent of people oppose the Senate calling 
witnesses to testify. Most Americans, 63 percent, believe the 
president should not be removed from office and even more, 67 
percent, say they don't expect the Senate to oust him. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans also expressed waning interest in the impeachment  
trial, with 88 percent saying the trial has offered little new or 
interesting information. 
</P>
<P>
	About 17 percent of Americans said they watched or listened to  
the proceedings on the day they were polled, during the period the 
survey was conducted from Jan. 19 to Jan. 25. The exception was 
Jan. 19, the first day of the presentation by the White House 
lawyers, when 31 percent said they followed the coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about various causes for their inattention, 47 percent  
said it was because the trial would not change their mind about the 
president, 41 percent said they found the proceedings too partisan 
and 36 percent said they haven't been following the proceedings 
because they believe it is unlikely Clinton will be removed from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone survey of 1,500 adults, ages 18 and older, has a  
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Gore To Unveil Immigrant Aid Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore has proposed  
spending millions of federal dollars on programs with plenty of 
California appeal -- education, immigration, technology and crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House plans to seek $1.3 billion over five years to  
restore health and disability benefits and food stamps for legal 
immigrants who lost coverage under the 1996 welfare overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Clinton and I made a solemn promise to this nation  
that we would remove these harmful provisions,'' Gore said Monday. 
``We are following through on that promise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal is expected to be part of the budget Clinton sends  
to Congress on Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president, who has announced he will seek the  
Democratic nomination for president in 2000, came to California in 
hopes of scoring points with Hispanics, who were livid at the 1996 
cuts and have since emerged as a crucial voting bloc. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Clinton's proposal, immigrants who enter the country  
legally will become eligible for Medicaid and Supplemental Security 
Income after five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 law denied the benefits to non-citizens arriving after  
that date. Clinton's plan would allow people who arrived after the 
deadline to be eligible as early as 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration would expand food stamp eligibility to  
certain elderly immigrants. It also would give states the option to 
provide health coverage to legal immigrant children and women who 
entered the country and became pregnant after Aug. 22, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore flew to California on Saturday and began promising more aid  
for an array of other initiatives. They include helping California 
reduce class sizes, dispensing $305 million to victims of crime and 
updating the nation's network of satellites. 
</P>
<P>
	This was Gore's 14th visit since January 1998 to California, a  
crucial state for presidential candidates.

<HEADLINE> Europe Told To Reform Labor Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Faced with pressure to lower interest  
rates, European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg says labor 
reform is the only way to reduce unemployment and boost Europe's 
flagging economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11 countries adopting the euro common currency must  
introduce flexibility and efficiency to labor and goods markets in 
order to reduce unemployment ``in a successful and lasting 
manner,'' Duisenberg said late Monday at a Frankfurt stock exchange 
reception. 
</P>
<P>
	While his comments were not new, his relatively forceful  
expression appeared to indicate Duisenberg wants to make clear that 
monetary policy, which his bank sets for the euro bloc, cannot 
solve Europe's economic challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	Duisenberg has come under pressure particularly from German  
Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine to lower interest rates as a way 
of reinvigorating the economy and easing joblessness, which 
averages 10.8 percent across Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Duisenberg also admonished the 11 euro nations to work harder to  
control spending, saying he was not convinced that tighter controls 
were being ``undertaken with sufficient determination.'' He called 
for restraint in wage increases and for government debt to be kept 
low. 
</P>
<P>
	Without balanced or surplus budgets and anti-inflation policies,  
it would be hard to create the ``stability culture'' the European 
Central Bank seeks to establish throughout Europe, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro bloc includes Austria, Belgium, Finland, France,  
Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and 
Spain.

<HEADLINE> Court Reinstates Hubbell Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Handing prosecutor Kenneth Starr a major  
victory, a divided federal appeals court today reinstated tax 
evasion charges against presidential friend and Whitewater figure 
Webster Hubbell, his wife and two friends. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that a federal judge overstepped  
his authority when he threw out the tax charges against the four 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Congress's  
independent counsel arrangements. ... It is not for lower court 
judges to undercut that decision by constructions of the Act that 
prevent this Independent Counsel from performing his duty in a 
manner reasonably approximating that of an ordinary prosecutor,'' 
the court held in two 2-1 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision means that Hubbell, who already has served one  
prison sentence, now faces two additional criminal trials involving 
Starr's office, which alleges he cheated his on taxes and 
obstructed investigators in the Whitewater investigation. The 
obstruction case was brought by Starr late last year while the 
appeal was pending in the tax case.

<HEADLINE> Same Plane, But Fares Differ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Airlines tout their new partnerships that  
allow passengers on different airlines to travel on the same plane 
and earn frequent flier miles redeemable from either partner. 
</P>
<P>
	What they don't say is that travelers buying tickets under those  
partnerships, known as ``code sharing,'' can pay vastly different 
prices for the same ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	An airfare analyst compared the cost of the same seat on the  
same plane and found a nearly $600 difference in the price paid for 
a ticket issued by Continental from the same ticket issued by its 
code share partner for the past year, Northwest. The only 
difference between the two tickets was which airline issued them. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Trippler, operator of the Internet-based ``Airfare  
Report,'' said the same kind of gap can be found with all of the 
partners in the nation's new string of code shares, including the 
tandems of United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, or American 
Airlines and US Airways. 
</P>
<P>
	The partner with the higher price depends on discounts and on  
which route they are being compared. 
</P>
<P>
	Trippler's warning sounds familiar: Buyer beware.  
</P>
<P>
	``Code sharing is so widespread, you better be on your toes. You  
better ask every single time, every single flight, 'Is this a code 
share?' And if so, 'With what airline?' and then ask for the price 
on both of them,'' he said on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines began code share partnerships as a means of increasing  
investor return, pooling resources and smoothing out travel for 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	While the airlines generally remain separate entities, they  
exchange frequent flier privileges and club memberships and also 
book tickets so travelers from each partner airline can make 
seamless connections no matter which one issues the tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	In doing so, airlines can help fill up each other's planes and  
also reach areas outside their normal network. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't mean code share passengers traveling on the same  
plane pay the same price. 
</P>
<P>
	To make his point, Trippler booked six different sets of  
flights, with one ticket from Continental and one from Northwest 
for each. While the flights had different numbers, depending on the 
airline issuing the ticket, they were flown on the same Northwest 
or Continental planes and had the same arrival and departure times. 
</P>
<P>
	The only difference was in the fares.  
</P>
<P>
	A Feb. 6-12 round trip from Newark to Singapore cost $847.31  
from Northwest, but $1,445.31 from Continental. A Feb. 8-10 round 
trip from Cleveland to Boise, Idaho, cost $406 from Northwest, but 
$1,650 from Continental. 
</P>
<P>
	A Northwest spokesman said that is exactly how the system is  
supposed to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't coordinate. That would be illegal,'' said airline  
spokesman Jon Austin. ``We are competing to sell tickets. On some 
code shares, that means tickets on the same plane, but that doesn't 
lessen the competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to explain the discrepancy between the Northwest and  
Continental fares, Austin replied: ``I have no idea. That would be 
asking me to read the mind of the Continental marketing folks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Continental did not immediately return a call seeking comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Travel agents and some consumer groups have fought code shares,  
saying the ``virtual merger'' of airlines will eventually stifle 
competition. More immediately, they say they further complicate the 
already puzzling world of airfares. 
</P>
<P>
	Trippler, a former travel agent, said using a travel agent is  
the best protection against paying different prices for tickets 
from code share partners. Some online travel services also offer 
fares from the perspective of both code share partners, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I seriously doubt that a Northwest agent is going to spend a  
lot of time checking the same ticket as a Continental fare,'' 
Trippler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Austin, the Northwest spokesman, said using a travel agent or  
booking directly with an airline ``is a wholly personal decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``I think a travel agent is a wonderful thing; I would  
support people who would want to go that way. On the other hand, 
there are people who book on their own or through the Internet, and 
I support that, too.''

<HEADLINE>  Pope Compares Abortion to Slavery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Pope John Paul II arrived in the heartland  
Tuesday for a 30-hour visit and likened the battle over abortion 
and euthanasia in America to the bitter legal clash over slavery on 
the eve of the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	``America faces a similar time of trial,'' he said at the  
airport, where he was met by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope, making his fifth trip to the U.S. mainland, later met  
privately with the president and attended a jubilant youth rally 
Tuesday night at the Kiel Center, where a crowd of more than 20,000 
welcomed him as if he were a rock star -- weeping, squealing, 
jumping up and down and waving handkerchiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am told there was much excitement in St. Louis during the  
recent baseball season, when two great players, Mark McGwire and 
Sammy Sosa, were competing to break the home run record,'' he told 
the young people. ``You can feel the same great enthusiasm as you 
train for a different goal -- the goal of following Christ, the goal 
of bringing his message to the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, John Paul is scheduled to celebrate Mass before  
104,000 people at the Trans World Dome. 
</P>
<P>
	The president and Hillary Rodham Clinton joined 500 families at  
a sweltering National Guard hangar at Lambert Airport to welcome 
the pope, who arrived from Mexico City after a triumphant, five-day 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
	``For 20 years you have challenged us to think of life not in  
terms of what we acquire for ourselves but what we give of 
ourselves,'' the president told the pontiff. ``We honor you for 
standing for human dignity and human rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton quoted a Polish phrase that means, ``May you live a  
hundred years and more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While many in St. Louis were euphoric, the 78-year-old pope's  
opening message to the American people was somber. His arm shook as 
he held the lectern at the airport, his body stooped over his text. 
Still, his voice was firm as he urged Americans to strive for a 
higher moral standard. 
</P>
<P>
	He reminded Americans of the Dred Scott case, tried in St.  
Louis' Old Courthouse. Scott, a slave purchased in 1833 by an Army 
surgeon stationed near St. Louis, sued for his freedom. Living in a 
free state, he said, made him a free man. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1857 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, in effect, that slaves  
were property and not citizens -- a decision, the pope said, that 
declared ``an entire class of human beings -- people of African 
descent -- outside the boundaries of the national community and the 
Constitution's protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Today,'' the pope went on, ``the conflict is between a culture  
that affirms, cherishes, and celebrates the gift of life, and a 
culture that seeks to declare entire groups of human beings -- the 
unborn, the terminally ill, the handicapped, and others considered 
`unuseful' -- to be outside the boundaries of legal protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pope is also a leading opponent of capital punishment and  
has intervened in several cases in the United States. Missouri's 
Supreme Court, without explanation, postponed an execution that was 
to have taken place while the pope was in town. Papal spokesman 
Joaquin Navarro-Valls called the postponement ``a mockery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During previous visits to the United States, home to 62 million  
Roman Catholics, the pope has spoken out against American 
materialism and consumerism. 
</P>
<P>
	At the airport Tuesday, John Paul avoided simmering disputes  
with the United States and dropped from the advance text of his 
speech any mention of land mines, drug trafficking or U.S. 
airstrikes against Iraq, something the Vatican has assailed as 
``aggression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the 20-minute meeting between Clinton and the pope,  
abortion only ``came up in passing'' and the Monica Lewinsky affair 
not at all, White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said. The two did 
discuss Cuba and Iraq, Navarro-Valls said. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, thousands hoping for a glimpse of the pontiff in his  
Popemobile lined the route of the papal motorcade as it made its 
way from the airport to St. Louis Cathedral. As the pope drew near, 
crowds sitting on hills rushed toward the temporary fences, 
cheering, waving banners and chanting, ``John Paul II, we love 
you!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Margaret Wilson, 81, sat in a folding chair for six hours at a  
spot along the parade route. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't imagine I'd ever get this close to the pope,'' she  
said. ``I'm glad I've lived long enough so I could see this.'' She 
added: ``First we had McGwire hitting all those home runs. Now we 
have the pope. I don't know what we're going to do for excitement 
after this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 600,000 people are expected to turn out to see the  
pope in St. Louis. More than 530,000 Roman Catholics live in and 
around the city, which was founded by French Catholics in 1764. 
John Paul came to town at the invitation of Archbishop Justin 
Rigali, a longtime friend. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mexico last week, the pope signed a declaration setting out  
the church's goals in the Americas for the new millennium. It 
condemned exploitative capitalism, drug trafficking, corruption and 
``the culture of death'' -- abortion, euthanasia and capital 
punishment. He also said the church must try harder to reach the 
rich and powerful, not just the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Early Tuesday, 750 Catholic youths from South Dakota bubbled  
over with enthusiasm outside the Kiel Center. They had traveled 12 
hours on 17 buses to reach St. Louis and didn't even have tickets 
to any of the events. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter how far away you are from him,'' said Ann  
Swanson, 17, of Valley Springs, S.D. ``You're still close to him.''

<HEADLINE> Watch Out for 'Portfolio Overlap' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There you are, casually scanning the portfolio  
holdings of a mutual fund in which you have just invested, when the 
sight of a couple of familiar stocks gives you a little jolt. 
</P>
<P>
	These guys own big positions in Sugarwater Industries and  
Orinoco.com? Gosh, so do the two other funds I own. I thought I was 
diversifying, spreading out my risks, but with these stocks I'm 
just buying more of the same thing! 
</P>
<P>
	So goes your introduction to a nagging problem in the world of  
fund investing. Call it duplication, redundancy, or portfolio 
overlap -- whatever name you put on it, you find yourself 
effectively paying two or three or more funds to own the same stock 
in your behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, overlap can be especially common, given that a few  
dozen elite stocks have been hogging most of the glory in an 
extremely selective market. With hundreds of stock-fund managers 
trying to stay on top of this trend, many of them naturally 
gravitate toward the same stocks. After all, that's where the money 
is. 
</P>
<P>
	So you can very easily wind up in a spot described by Olivia  
Barbee, managing editor of the monthly Morningstar FundInvestor 
newsletter: Your funds come in different wrappers, but the contents 
may be all too similar. 
</P>
<P>
	If you pay no attention to it, this pitfall can defeat the  
purpose of your diversification efforts: To keep you from being too 
concentrated in any given stock or sector of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortunately, though, there are several things you can do to  
overcome overlap, or at least minimize it as a factor in your 
financial life. They range from simple, rule-of-thumb principles a 
casual investor can keep in mind, to more elaborate measures 
suitable for activists willing to invest hours in front of a 
computer screen. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Barbee's first suggestion: ``Avoid funds run by the same  
manager. Zebras don't change their stripes, and managers rarely 
change their strategies. If you own two funds by Famous Manager A, 
chances are you own two of the same thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And her second idea: Don't load up too much on funds from any  
one ``boutique'' firm. ``Janus is a growth specialist. Oakmark 
means absolute value. Such fund families are excellent at what they 
do, but it's questionable whether owning three of their funds gives 
you anything you won't get with one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spreading your money among different fund families can make a  
lot of sense on general diversification grounds. It helps ensure 
that you are hiring managers with truly different viewpoints. 
</P>
<P>
	Doing this may increase your paperwork burden, but it's likely  
to be worth the trouble. If you invest through a broker or 
financial firm's fund marketplace, you may be able to keep most or 
all of a widely diversified investment program in the handy 
confines of just one or two accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, pay regular attention to the investment styles of funds  
you own or are thinking about buying. If you buy funds straight 
from the top of the most recent performance lists without regard to 
style or category, chances are you are going to own several 
versions of the same thing (which may well be as out of favor next 
year as it is popular now). 
</P>
<P>
	In the ideal, if you own half a dozen stock funds, some will be  
domestic, but maybe one or two will be international; some will 
emphasize big stocks, and others small stocks; some will follow a 
growth philosophy, and others a value strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	Much better, in most cases, to own a little from each style  
category than to try to figure out which type will prosper most in 
the next year or two, and then bet accordingly. Funds, after all, 
are designed to take the ``betting'' out of investing. 
</P>
<P>
	More from Ms. Barbee: ``Scrutinize sector weightings. If two  
funds from the same category sport similar sector weightings, they 
may own many of the same stocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the truly energetic, Ms. Barbee suggests, ``Compare the  
stocks in your funds' portfolios. Those who have the time and the 
inclination can enter all of their funds' holdings into a 
spreadsheet and sort by stock name.'' Morningstar and other fund 
research firms sell software products that can simplify the job, if 
you prefer putting money rather than time into the project.

<HEADLINE> Burlington Plans To Cut 2,900 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Textile manufacturer Burlington  
Industries Inc. is cutting 2,900 jobs, or 17 percent of its work 
force, and closing seven plants in an effort to streamline its 
apparel fabrics business. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials blamed the decision to reduce capacity on the  
surge of low-priced garment imports, primarily from Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of the plants are in North Carolina while the others are in  
South Carolina and Virginia. Burlington has 29 plants overall and 
employs 17,400 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been running our apparel fabrics operations at less  
than full capacity over the last 9-12 months, anticipating that the 
surge of low-priced garment imports from Asia might only be the 
temporary result of the Asian financial crisis,'' said George W. 
Henderson III, chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We now believe that this situation is more permanent in nature  
and we must reduce our U.S. manufacturing capacity accordingly and 
utilize only our most modern facilities to be competitive,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Burlington Industries is in the process of building $300 million  
in new plants in Mexico, and saddened workers Tuesday said they 
were worried about an exodus of jobs to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew once they got that place up and running in Mexico, we'd  
be in trouble,'' said Ronny Williams, who has worked nine years at 
the Oxford plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also released its first-quarter earnings, saying its  
profit for the three-month period fell to $8 million, or 14 cents a 
share, compared with $13.2 million, or 22 cents a share, a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales fell to $407 million from $482 million a year earlier.  
</P>
<P>
	``Although lower than last year, our first quarter earnings were  
at expected levels despite the difficult environment,'' said 
Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a reorganization, the company will combine its  
Burlington Klopman Fabrics and Burlington Tailored Fashions 
divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Burlington Sportswear will become a business unit within  
the Burlington Global Denim division. The company will close its 
knitted fabrics and shirts business. 
</P>
<P>
	The plants that will be closed are in Mooresville, Forest City,  
Oxford, Cramerton and Statesville in North Carolina; Bishopville, 
S.C.; and Hillsville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``I reckon it's going to hurt a lot of guys bad. I know a lot of  
guys who just bought a new house,'' said Alexander Peace, 54, who 
works second shift at the company's yarn plant in Oxford. 
</P>
<P>
	It is also eliminating a department in Raeford, N.C. and making  
other cutbacks throughout the company, Burlington said.

<HEADLINE> African Backlash in Olympic Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- From the Sahara to the Cape of  
Good Hope, sports authorities in Africa complain that their IOC 
members were unfairly made the focus of the biggest corruption 
scandal in Olympics history. 
</P>
<P>
	With six Africans among the nine members expelled or forced to  
resign in an unprecedented purge by the International Olympic 
Committee, and a seventh delegate from the continent still under 
investigation, officials said they had been portrayed as villains 
instead of a small part of a corrupt system. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lavish gifts were presented ... to all IOC members, not just  
African members,'' said Robert Magagula, vice president of 
Swaziland's national Olympic committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The expulsions and resignations were linked to accusations of  
payoffs in Salt Lake City's successful bid for the 2002 Winter 
Games. Africans bitterly noted that while their IOC members are 
bearing the brunt of the dismissals, the games will go on as 
scheduled in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sanctions ... amount to punishing the weak. I wish the  
sanctions would hit the corrupters as well,'' Congolese journalist 
Imana Ingulu said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean Claude Ndalla, former sports minister of neighboring  
Republic of Congo, said the IOC's purge ``smacks of a conspiracy 
against Africans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But as the outcry became louder, another allegation emerged  
against the African member cited for the most widespread abuse in 
an IOC report issued Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Robbie Stewart, a member of Cape Town's failed bid to hold the  
2004 Olympics, said Jean-Claude Ganga of Republic of Congo sought 
an apparent bribe of up to $2,000 in car parts. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he came (to Cape Town) he wanted virtually a whole Land  
Cruiser full of motor spares,'' Stewart told The Associated Press. 
``He just arrived and gave us a list of spare parts and asked if we 
could help him get these spares. He wanted so many, it would have 
been easier to just ship out a whole new Land Cruiser.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The spare parts weren't purchased and Ganga, who never mentioned  
repaying Cape Town officials for the parts, didn't press the issue, 
Stewart said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga, who was ousted by IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch,  
was said to be in the United States on Tuesday and could not be 
located for comment. The IOC report said he received $216,010 in 
cash, travel and medical expenses and other lavish gifts from Salt 
Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	No African country has held an Olympics. Several are considering  
bids for the 2008 Games, with South Africa again a leading 
contender. 
</P>
<P>
	But IOC executive board member Kevan Gosper of Australia said  
the dismissals were a ``setback to the African continent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The important point, I think, is we took a decisive course of  
action,'' Gosper told CNN. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite official outrage, there are no calls for African nations  
to retaliate by boycotting the next Olympics in Sydney in 2000. 
Such action happened in 1976, when Ganga, still 10 years away from 
IOC membership, led African nations out of the Montreal Olympics. 
He demanded New Zealand's expulsion because its rugby team had 
played in apartheid-era South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Disclosures, meanwhile, may emerge about others taking payoffs.  
</P>
<P>
	``We all knew about the bribes,'' Magagula said. ``I've seen how  
the IOC members were treated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When a $150 limit on the value of gifts was imposed, the payoffs  
became clandestine, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lavish gifts were presented at midnight, instead of being  
rolled on a trolley through a hotel lobby at noon,'' Magagula said. 
``That happened to all IOC members, not just African members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC member Sam Ramsamy, who also heads South Africa's Olympic  
committee, said he felt ``ashamed that Africans are listed in this 
so-called scandal,'' but didn't feel they were being targeted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither we nor the IOC have singled out any continent or  
country,'' he said in a written response to questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Another IOC member from Africa, vice president Keba Mbaye of  
Senegal, said committee members from impoverished countries might 
have been more susceptible to accepting gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who are most in need are also those who are the most  
open to offers which sometimes verge on the provocative,'' said 
Mbaye, a judge on the International Court of Justice and a member 
of the IOC corruption inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Some ousted IOC members said they wanted to send the gifts to  
their home countries to sponsor development. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Zein el-Abdin Abdel-Gadir, expelled as the IOC member from  
Sudan, said he accepted money as a loan to help pay for his son's 
studies in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Sudanese newspapers rallied to his defense Tuesday. A banner  
headline declared: ``He is beyond the accusations and rumors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Ball, who led Cape Town's Olympics bid, hopes the  
housecleaning will strengthen the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the opportunities is for the IOC to get back to the  
charter and goal of the Olympic movement, which is the development 
of mankind,'' he said. ``It's what the IOC should be about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Gadir and Ganga, African IOC members implicated  
in the Salt Lake scandal were Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi of Libya 
and David Sikhulumi Sibandze of Swaziland, who resigned, and Lamine 
Keita of Mali and Charles Mukora of Kenya, who were expelled. Louis 
Guirandou-N'Diaye of the Ivory Coast remains under investigation.

<HEADLINE>  Pope Compares Abortion to Slavery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Pope John Paul II arrived in the heartland  
Tuesday for a 30-hour visit and likened the battle over abortion 
and euthanasia in America to the bitter legal clash over slavery on 
the eve of the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	``America faces a similar time of trial,'' he said at the  
airport, where he was met by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope, making his fifth trip to the U.S. mainland, later met  
privately with the president and attended a jubilant youth rally 
Tuesday night at the Kiel Center, where a crowd of more than 20,000 
welcomed him as if he were a rock star -- weeping, squealing, 
jumping up and down and waving handkerchiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am told there was much excitement in St. Louis during the  
recent baseball season, when two great players, Mark McGwire and 
Sammy Sosa, were competing to break the home run record,'' he told 
the young people. ``You can feel the same great enthusiasm as you 
train for a different goal -- the goal of following Christ, the goal 
of bringing his message to the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, John Paul is scheduled to celebrate Mass before  
104,000 people at the Trans World Dome. 
</P>
<P>
	The president and Hillary Rodham Clinton joined 500 families at  
a sweltering National Guard hangar at Lambert Airport to welcome 
the pope, who arrived from Mexico City after a triumphant, five-day 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
	``For 20 years you have challenged us to think of life not in  
terms of what we acquire for ourselves but what we give of 
ourselves,'' the president told the pontiff. ``We honor you for 
standing for human dignity and human rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton quoted a Polish phrase that means, ``May you live a  
hundred years and more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While many in St. Louis were euphoric, the 78-year-old pope's  
opening message to the American people was somber. His arm shook as 
he held the lectern at the airport, his body stooped over his text. 
Still, his voice was firm as he urged Americans to strive for a 
higher moral standard. 
</P>
<P>
	He reminded Americans of the Dred Scott case, tried in St.  
Louis' Old Courthouse. Scott, a slave purchased in 1833 by an Army 
surgeon stationed near St. Louis, sued for his freedom. Living in a 
free state, he said, made him a free man. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1857 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, in effect, that slaves  
were property and not citizens -- a decision, the pope said, that 
declared ``an entire class of human beings -- people of African 
descent -- outside the boundaries of the national community and the 
Constitution's protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Today,'' the pope went on, ``the conflict is between a culture  
that affirms, cherishes, and celebrates the gift of life, and a 
culture that seeks to declare entire groups of human beings -- the 
unborn, the terminally ill, the handicapped, and others considered 
`unuseful' -- to be outside the boundaries of legal protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pope is also a leading opponent of capital punishment and  
has intervened in several cases in the United States. Missouri's 
Supreme Court, without explanation, postponed an execution that was 
to have taken place while the pope was in town. Papal spokesman 
Joaquin Navarro-Valls called the postponement ``a mockery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During previous visits to the United States, home to 62 million  
Roman Catholics, the pope has spoken out against American 
materialism and consumerism. 
</P>
<P>
	At the airport Tuesday, John Paul avoided simmering disputes  
with the United States and dropped from the advance text of his 
speech any mention of land mines, drug trafficking or U.S. 
airstrikes against Iraq, something the Vatican has assailed as 
``aggression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the 20-minute meeting between Clinton and the pope,  
abortion only ``came up in passing'' and the Monica Lewinsky affair 
not at all, White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said. The two did 
discuss Cuba and Iraq, Navarro-Valls said. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, thousands hoping for a glimpse of the pontiff in his  
Popemobile lined the route of the papal motorcade as it made its 
way from the airport to St. Louis Cathedral. As the pope drew near, 
crowds sitting on hills rushed toward the temporary fences, 
cheering, waving banners and chanting, ``John Paul II, we love 
you!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Margaret Wilson, 81, sat in a folding chair for six hours at a  
spot along the parade route. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't imagine I'd ever get this close to the pope,'' she  
said. ``I'm glad I've lived long enough so I could see this.'' She 
added: ``First we had McGwire hitting all those home runs. Now we 
have the pope. I don't know what we're going to do for excitement 
after this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 600,000 people are expected to turn out to see the  
pope in St. Louis. More than 530,000 Roman Catholics live in and 
around the city, which was founded by French Catholics in 1764. 
John Paul came to town at the invitation of Archbishop Justin 
Rigali, a longtime friend. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mexico last week, the pope signed a declaration setting out  
the church's goals in the Americas for the new millennium. It 
condemned exploitative capitalism, drug trafficking, corruption and 
``the culture of death'' -- abortion, euthanasia and capital 
punishment. He also said the church must try harder to reach the 
rich and powerful, not just the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Early Tuesday, 750 Catholic youths from South Dakota bubbled  
over with enthusiasm outside the Kiel Center. They had traveled 12 
hours on 17 buses to reach St. Louis and didn't even have tickets 
to any of the events. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter how far away you are from him,'' said Ann  
Swanson, 17, of Valley Springs, S.D. ``You're still close to him.''

<HEADLINE>  Rome Mayor Demands New Olympic Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Rome's mayor demands a new vote for  
the 2004 Olympics, contending the choice of Athens, Greece, is 
tainted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very angry,'' Mayor Francesco Rutelli said today. ``A  
panel of IOC experts and athletes gave Rome the No. 1 spot on the 
list of candidates. Until 24 hours before the vote we were in the 
lead. And then -- who knows what happened?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after the International Olympic Committee ousted six  
members as the result of a corruption scandal, Rutelli said a 
committee of experts should carry out a new vote. In September 
1997, Athens beat Rome 66-41 in the final round of voting for the 
2004 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing is to remove every shadow of doubt  
about the decision,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Athens has not been specifically targeted, the IOC said it  
will look into the selection process for the games from 1996 to 
2006. The IOC said Salt Lake City's bid committee spent millions of 
dollars on 14 IOC members, including travel expenses, scholarships 
for their children and cash payments. In addition to the 
expulsions, three IOC members quit. 
</P>
<P>
	In Greece, the president of Hellenic Olympic Committee, Lambis  
Nikolaou, defended his city's victory in the 1997 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vote is closed,'' Nikolaou said. ``The games were given  
cleanly. The doors are open, the dogs are tied up and they can come 
and examine whatever they want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--The Greens faction in Berlin's Senate sent files to the IOC  
from its 1993 campaign to win the 2000 Games. Greens leader Judith 
Demba called the IOC a ``club of corrupt old men'' and said its 
attempts to clean up its act were not credible. 
</P>
<P>
	Demba said Berlin bidders spent $1.53 million on travel,  
lodging, car rental, gifts and other expenses for 56 IOC members 
who visited the city, claiming scores of presents for IOC members 
went over the IOC limit of $200. 
</P>
<P>
	Berlin also paid ``horrendous'' doctors' bills, Demba said, and  
organized a Berlin Philharmonic concert with the daughter of the 
South Korean IOC vice president. The letter did not give his name 
but the South Korean IOC vice president is Kim Un-Yong, who is 
under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Demba said Samaranch charged the bid committee $3,724 for a  
domestic air ticket between Stuttgart and Berlin that normally 
would cost one-tenth of the sum. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Nagano police official Minoru Kono said IOC officials visiting  
his city received free rides on police helicopters during the 
city's winning bid for the 1998 Winter Games. Nagano officials 
already said voters were given free trips to Kyoto, some IOC 
officials were entertained by geisha and IOC president Juan Antonio 
Samaranch received an expensive painting and Japanese sword. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talk about excessive entertainment, but the question is  
excessive compared to what?'' said Japanese Olympic Committee 
executive board member Chiharu Igaya, also an IOC executive board 
member. ``What was offered was definitely not excessive. It was 
normal. In business, entertainment is far more extravagant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- In England, the head of Manchester's failed bid for the 2000  
Games said IOC members were taken to tennis matches at Wimbledon 
and Football Association Cup games as part of a $9 million 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were in the business of showing people round,'' Bob Scott  
said. ``We were in the business of entertaining. We were in the 
business of, you know, sort of gross hospitality is the phrase that 
I think we can be accused of,'' Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's very different from winning any major  
contract. You put your best foot forward and that involves 
entertainment. You may think it stinks but that's the name of the 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Samaranch defended criticism of him and the Olympics,  
saying he lives a modest life -- not a life of pampered luxury as 
his critics contend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not a rich man,'' he said. ``I am a normal man. My style  
of life is the same for many, many years. I have no yachts. I have 
no planes. I have no cars, luxury cars. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like big dinners, big lunches. I am doing my best to  
try to be fit with physical exercises every morning. That's my 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 78-year-old Spaniard is trying to restore his image and that  
of the IOC in the wake of the Olympics' biggest corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I read that I take a helicopter from Lausanne to (nearby)  
Geneva, that's crazy,'' Samaranch said. ``It is much quicker to go 
by car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Listen, I am a normal person. I am giving 85 percent of my  
time to the IOC, living in Lausanne. I have a very small suite, 
paying 300 Swiss francs ($220) a day when I am present, 100 Swiss 
francs ($72) when I'm not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch angrily fired back at his critics, praising his record  
and dismissing renewed calls for his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am pleased with myself, what I have done these 18 years,''  
Samaranch said. ``Today, the International Olympic Committee is 
very important in our society.''

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- About 200 elementary students  
protesting the loss of their school blocked Denmark's national

<HEADLINE> Compaq To Sell Stock in AltaVista </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp. wants AltaVista, its  
Web-search service, to conduct a new type of search: Find riches on 
the World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining a race to cash in on the Internet stock boom, Compaq on  
Tuesday announced plans to spin off its AltaVista subsidiary into a 
separate, publicly owned company. Proceeds from the stock sale 
could help AltaVista strike deals with other Web companies and 
expand into a bigger Internet destination, offering everything from 
financial information to shopping. 
</P>
<P>
	That could help Compaq, which is already the No. 1 seller of  
personal computers, sell even more PCs. By luring more visitors to 
AltaVista, Compaq could draw shoppers to its own site and begin to 
catch up with archrival Dell Computer Corp., which sells more than 
$10 million worth of PCs a day over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	An autonomous AltaVista will be freer to enter agreements with  
rivals to Compaq, said Chris Lochhead, chief marketing officer at 
Scient Corp., a San Francisco-based electronic-commerce consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	``The competitiors in their market space have innovated much  
more rapidly and moved much more quickly,'' he said. ``This now 
unleashes them so they can be more like their competitors from that 
point of view.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq is the latest company to try to exploit investors'  
seemingly insatiable demand for stocks with a ``.com'' suffix, 
which gives Web firms valuable currency for snapping up other 
companies. Walt Disney Co. two weeks ago saw its stock soar after 
detailing plans for a new Web site it developed with Internet 
search engine Infoseek, ratcheting up the competition with 
AltaVista, Yahoo and other popular Internet locations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe it's the most effective way to achieve (our)  
business objective,'' Compaq chief executive Eckhard Pfeiffer said 
at a press announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	The spinoff plans announced Tuesday pushed Compaq's stock up  
nearly 6 percent in late afternoon trading, rising $2.56 1/4 to $49.25 
on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	AltaVista offers a widely used search engine and a variety of  
other options, including news, stock quotes and shopping services, 
and took in about $40 million in revenue last year. But it ranked 
No. 12 among Web sites last month, lagging Yahoo, Excite, Lycos and 
other top destinations, according to the Media Metrix research 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The spinoff plans eased intense speculation over Compaq's plans  
for AltaVista, which it bought as part of its $9 billion 
acquisition of Digital Equipment Corp. last year. Compaq was said 
to be shopping around for another leading Web destination. The 
spinoff plans seem to make an outright purchase less likely, 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	AltaVista could raise from $2 billion to $5 billion in an  
initial public offering, giving it money to strike deals with other 
Web firms and possibly acquire lesser-known Web companies, said 
Piper Jaffrey Inc. analyst Ashok Kumar. But the stratospheric 
market capitalization of some firms could limit AltaVista's ability 
to buy better-known Internet companies. 
</P>
<P>
	One possibility is for AltaVista to use its stock proceeds to  
enter a cross-marketing arrangement with an Internet service 
provider, such as a big telephone company, which could make 
AltaVista the default Internet destination for its subscribers. In 
return, AltaVista could use its Web site to advertise the Internet 
provider's services. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of Tuesday's announcement, Compaq said it reached a deal  
with Microsoft Corp. for AltaVista to become the primary search 
engine on the software company's online service, the Microsoft 
Network. The stock of Inktomi Corp., Microsoft's current Web search 
engine, tumbled after news that AltaVista would replace it. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq officials would not say when the offering might occur,  
but the announcement comes at a time of ferocious demand for 
Internet-related stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The first initial public offering of 1999, online financial news  
provider MarketWatch.com, soared 474 percent. MarketWatch followed 
the pattern of skyrocketing offerings last year from such companies 
as Web page provider theglobe.com, online auctioneer eBay.com, and 
Ticketmaster Online-CitySearch Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The newly formed AltaVista Corp. will be based in Palo Alto,  
Calif., and headed by Rod Schrock, who has been senior vice 
president of Compaq's consumer product group. Schrock led Compaq's 
recent acquisition of Shopping.com, a popular shopping Web site.

<HEADLINE> Hog Prices Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Last year, Jeff Duling converted his  
600-acre hog farm in northwest Ohio from a birth-to-market 
operation to one that raised young pigs until they are ready for 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Then one of the worst price crises in the history of the pork  
industry hit. Duling had based his investment in the operations 
change on earlier market conditions and ended up with $80,000 in 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the hog market is going to come back, but it's going  
to take me two years to get back what I lost in two months,'' said 
Duling, 32, who raises hogs in Ottawa, 50 miles southwest of 
Toledo. 
</P>
<P>
	Hog prices are slowly edging up to the break-even point after  
plunging so low last fall that farmers nationwide were losing $50 
to $75 a pig. Now, Ohio pig farmers and their suppliers are 
rethinking their position in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first this crisis last quarter hurt the producers,'' said  
Bryan Black of Canal Winchester, president-elect of the Ohio Pork 
Producers Council and a 300-sow farmer. ``This quarter it hurt not 
only the producers but people they do business with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black, 38, said some owners of small farms were finally forced  
out of business by the crash in prices. He predicts the next 
shakeout will come in the spring, when bigger producers return to 
the banks to talk refinancing. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts have blamed the low prices on overproduction by  
megahog farms. Federal officials are also investigating allegations 
of price-fixing by large meatpackers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Murphy is sales manager with Birchwood Genetics in West  
Manchester, about 25 miles west of Dayton. The company sells boar 
semen to hog farmers across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're affected more now than when prices were tough because of  
our position in the pork chain,'' Murphy said. ``Our biggest 
downfall is we operate so much off of cash. When the cash isn't 
there, we're not prepared for a crisis of this kind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company tightened its belt but hasn't had to lay off any of  
its 22 employees yet. Another round of low prices would cause 
serious trouble, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Schnipke, 61, raised hogs for more than 35 years in Ottawa.  
He said Monday the low prices made him decide to sell his 100 
remaining sows and get out of the business of raising pigs 
independently. He might take hogs back on contract, where he simply 
feeds and tends the animals, for which he receives a set fee per 
pig. 
</P>
<P>
	Marion Horton in nearby Hancock County figures he was losing  
$1,100 a week during the worst of the crisis. He reduced his 
inventory from 600 pigs to about 100. 
</P>
<P>
	He's going to stay in business for now because at age 67, he  
doesn't have the debt that hangs over younger farmers' heads. But 
he's keeping an eye on the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to keep on raising hogs until I lose the farm,''  
Horton said.

<HEADLINE> Bosnia Peace Force Cut Said Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO will reduce its peacekeeping force in  
Bosnia by 10 percent over the next two months, reflecting progress 
toward a more stable peace, a senior White House official said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Berger, national security adviser to President Clinton,  
told reporters that after a review of force requirements in Bosnia, 
NATO officials have decided to shrink the 32,000-strong 
multinational force that has been enforcing peace in Bosnia since 
the Dayton accords were reached in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	A 10 percent reduction would mean withdrawing about 3,200  
troops. Berger gave no figures except to say the U.S. contribution 
to peacekeeping there would be cut from the present 6,900 to 6,200 
by March. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a good development, a reflection of the fact that  
we're steadily making progress in Bosnia,'' Berger said. He cited 
continuing ``serious challenges'' for the civilian organizations 
that are trying to establish a stable political system and rebuild 
war-torn Bosnia but added, ``On that side as well I think we are 
making progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is one of 25 countries with troops serving as  
peacekeepers in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said NATO defense ministers would make a further review  
of troop requirements in Bosnia this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	On the related subject of instability in nearby Kosovo, Berger  
said Clinton remains opposed to sending U.S. ground troops there to 
intervene in the conflict between Serb security forces and 
rebellious ethnic Albanian forces. He held open the possibility, 
however, that Clinton might approve including American troops in a 
peacekeeping force in Kosovo-- assuming there is a political 
settlement first. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had no decisions along those lines,'' Berger said.

<HEADLINE>  Pope Compares Abortion to Slavery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Pope John Paul II arrived in the heartland  
Tuesday for a 30-hour visit and likened America's dispute over 
abortion and euthanasia to the bitter legal battle over slavery on 
the eve of the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	``America faces a similar time of trial,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and the first lady joined 500 families in a  
National Guard hangar at Lambert Airport to greet the pope on his 
seventh papal trip to the United States. John Paul flew in from 
Mexico City after a triumphant, five-day visit. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope later met privately with the president and was to  
attend a youth rally 20,000-people strong at the Kiel Center on 
Tuesday night. On Wednesday, he is scheduled to celebrate a Mass 
before 104,000 people at the Trans World Dome. 
</P>
<P>
	``We welcome you back to America,'' the president told the  
pontiff. ``For 20 years you have challenged us to think of life not 
in terms of what we acquire for ourselves but what we give of 
ourselves. ... We honor you for standing for human dignity and 
human rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president quoted a Polish phrase that means, ``May you live  
a hundred years and more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By mid-morning thousands of young people had circled the Gateway  
Arch before walking to the Kiel Center and the Papal Plaza nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	``We love Jesus, yes we do! We love you Jesus, how about you?''  
youth groups shouted back and forth. 
</P>
<P>
	While the crowd was euphoric, the 78-year-old pope's opening  
message to the American people was more somber. His arm shook as he 
held the lectern, his body stooped over his text. Still, his voice 
was firm as he urged Americans to reach for a higher moral vision. 
</P>
<P>
	He reminded Americans of the Dred Scott case, tried in St.  
Louis' Old Courthouse. Scott, a slave purchased in 1833 by an Army 
surgeon stationed near St. Louis, sued for his freedom. Living in a 
free state, he said, made him a free man. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1857 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, in effect, that slaves  
were property and not citizens -- a decision, the pope said, that 
declared ``an entire class of human beings -- people of African 
descent -- outside the boundaries of the national community and the 
Constitution's protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Today,'' the pope went on, ``the conflict is between a culture  
that affirms, cherishes, and celebrates the gift of life, and a 
culture that seeks to declare entire groups of human beings -- the 
unborn, the terminally ill, the handicapped, and others considered 
`unuseful' -- to be outside the boundaries of legal protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pope is also a leading opponent of capital punishment and  
has intervened in several cases in the United States. Missouri's 
Supreme Court, without explanation, postponed an execution that was 
to have taken place while the pope was in town. Papal spokesman 
Joaquin Navarro-Valls called the postponement ``a mockery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During previous U.S. visits, the pope has spoken out against  
materialism and consumerism in America. 
</P>
<P>
	At the airport Tuesday, he did not discuss land mines, drug  
trafficking or Iraq, though they were mentioned in the text of his 
original speech, which the Vatican considers an official statement. 
In the past he has assailed U.S.-British airstrikes against Iraq as 
``aggression.'' John Paul opposes economic sanctions against Iraq 
and other countries because, he believes, they don't work and add 
to the suffering of the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	During the pope's private meeting with the president, the issue  
of Clinton's impeachment did not come up, Navarro-Valls said. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 600,000 people are expected to turn out to see the  
pope in St. Louis. More than 530,000 Catholics live in and around 
St. Louis, which was founded by French Catholics in 1764. John Paul 
came to town at the invitation of Archbishop Justin Rigali, a 
longtime friend. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mexico last week, the pope signed a declaration setting out  
the church's goals in the Americas for the new millennium. It 
condemned exploitative capitalism, drug trafficking, corruption and 
``the culture of death'' -- abortion, euthanasia and capital 
punishment. He also said the church must try harder to reach the 
rich and powerful, not just the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Early Tuesday, 750 Catholic youths from South Dakota bubbled  
over with enthusiasm outside the Kiel Center. They had traveled 12 
hours on 17 buses to reach St. Louis and didn't even have tickets 
to any of the events. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter how far away you are from him,'' said Ann  
Swanson, 17, of Valley Springs, S.D. ``You're still close to him.''

<HEADLINE> Kendall Subpoenaed Starr Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's lawyers were on the verge  
of questioning prosecutor Kenneth Starr and his staff last June 
about leaked information to the press in the Monica Lewinsky 
scandal, according to newly released court documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr fought a successful last-minute, behind-the-scenes court  
battle to block subpoenas from attorney David Kendall, according to 
1,600 pages of documents released Tuesday by U.S. District Judge 
Norma Holloway Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, members of Starr's staff were interviewed about  
alleged leaks to the press by a court appointee who has no 
connection to either the prosecutor or the Clinton camp. The 
continuing court probe of alleged leaks by Starr's office was set 
in motion by Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the newly released documents is a June 29 letter to Starr  
deputy Robert Bittman in which Kendall said ``we propose to depose 
... seven individuals'' and ``we do want to complete all 
depositions'' by July 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall's plans included interrogating Starr, deputies Jackie  
Bennett and Hickman Ewing, prosecutors Michael Emmick and Bruce 
Udolf, and office spokesmen Charles Bakaly and Deborah Gershman. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall dropped a two-page subpoena on Starr's office calling  
for all records of any contact with journalists, authors, media 
commentators and columnists. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyers issued the subpoena to Starr's office after  
Johnson ruled June 19 that several media reports about the Lewinsky 
investigation appeared to contain sensitive grand jury information 
that may have come from Starr's office. Johnson directed that a 
hearing be conducted in which Starr should show cause why he should 
not be held in contempt of court for violating federal rules of 
criminal procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr took the controversy to a federal appeals court and  
Johnson in September ordered the court review by her own appointee, 
cutting out any involvement by Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	In the court battle before Johnson last summer, lawyers for  
Starr's office argued that lawyers for Clinton would be in a 
position to find out about the inner workings of Starr's 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court has ordered that potential witnesses and/or targets  
of the grand jury investigation be allowed'' to question witnesses 
and gather records ``and be permitted to participate in the 
evidentiary hearing'' before the judge, lawyers representing 
Starr's office said in papers filed in early July before Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's lawyers said the procedures Johnson set up ``threaten  
the integrity of the grand jury proceeding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's lawyers suggested that the leaks of information about  
the Lewinsky investigation came from inside the White House or from 
defense lawyers.

<HEADLINE>  Pollock Painting Damaged in Rome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- One of Italy's most persistent art vandals attacked  
a Jackson Pollock painting Tuesday, scribbling on it with a gray 
marker until he was grabbed by guards. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Rome's National Gallery of Modern Art said the  
damage inflicted on Pollock's 1947 ``Watery Paths'' was not 
serious. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect was identified as Piero Cannata, 52, who broke off a  
toe on the left foot of Michelangelo's famed statue of David in 
Florence in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, he used a marker to deface a fresco by  
Renaissance master Filippo Lippi in Prato's cathedral. Cannata 
spent time in mental hospitals after both incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Museum official Elena Di Maio said guards were alerted by the  
screams of museum visitors who saw Cannata attack the Pollock. 
</P>
<P>
	``Watery Paths'' is a classic example of Pollock's famed  
``action painting'' technique. ``The damage is not serious,'' Di

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Cautions Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Concerned about the recent wild swings of the  
Nasdaq Stock Market, the brokers' group operating the market has 
warned investors they may lose money from delays in executing 
trades or may be unable to get into their online accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	And as trading volume shoots higher than the electronic Nasdaq  
market can handle, NASD Regulation, the self-policing arm of the 
National Association of Securities Dealers, is suggesting that 
brokerage firms, too, warn investors of possible losses and 
aggravation. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq, the nation's second-largest stock exchange, has been  
whipsawed in recent weeks by roller-coaster swings in prices of 
Internet stocks -- some of them gaining or losing $50 or $60 a share 
daily in extremely heavy trading. In a trading frenzy earlier this 
month, huge volume over the Internet caused delays in online access 
for several firms, potentially costing investors thousands of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of NASD officials and executives of Wall Street trading  
firms has been meeting almost weekly since December to discuss the 
situation and possible solutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Pasternak, president and chief executive officer of Knight  
Securities Inc., the biggest Nasdaq trading company, said Tuesday 
the group was examining possible ``structural solutions.'' He 
declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	In bulletins to its member firms and in a posting on its Web  
site for investors, NASD Regulation cited the recent ``turbulent 
market conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Recent increased volatility and (trading) volume present new  
issues for investors, regardless of the method of trading,'' the 
group said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Customers eager to trade Internet stocks have flooded their  
brokers with large numbers of orders (to buy or sell), leading to 
large order imbalances ... and backlogs,'' one of the bulletins to 
firms noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, investors who trade through brokers at full-service or  
discount firms may have trouble getting through to them by phone, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, many firms have started to use procedures designed  
to keep customers' orders flowing while also reducing the firms' 
exposure to ``extraordinary market risk,'' NASD Regulation said. 
Some Nasdaq trading firms will temporarily discontinue normal 
automatic executions of trading orders, handling them manually. 
</P>
<P>
	NASD Regulation told the firms their handling of customers'  
orders must be ``fair, consistent and reasonable'' and they should 
tell customers when unusual execution procedures are being used in 
a volatile market. 
</P>
<P>
	NASD Regulation also warned online trading firms that  
advertisements or sales brochures should not exaggerate the speed 
and reliability of their services. The online firms also should 
inform investors about the risks of trading over the Internet and 
the possibility of delays in trades being executed, the regulators 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The group said investors should educate themselves about how  
securities trades are executed, especially during periods of 
volatile prices and heavy volume. They should also ask plenty of 
questions before opening an online account or placing the first 
trade, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
	State securities regulators applauded the NASD's action.  
</P>
<P>
	``NASD Regulation is right to caution brokerage firms and the  
public about volatile markets,'' said Marc Beauchamp, spokesman for 
the North American Securities Administrators Association. ``News 
coverage has glamorized online trading and portrayed Internet 
stocks as the high-tech road to riches. Main Street investors -- 
unless they have the temperament of gamblers and money they can 
afford to lose -- should probably stick to mutual funds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  
declined comment on the NASD's action. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the SEC approved Nasdaq's request to expand from five  
to 15 minutes the ``window'' in which trading firms can make price 
quotes on newly released stocks, called initial public offerings, 
before they officially begin trading. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Study: Parkinson's Not Inherited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Following a landmark study of more than 17,000  
twins, researchers reported today that most cases of Parkinson's 
disease are not due to a genetic defect but are caused by factors 
that are likely environmental. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time, today we can say that for people with  
Parkinson's disease diagnosed after age 50, it's most commonly 
caused by environmental factors,'' said Dr. Caroline Tanner of the 
Parkinson's Institute in Sunnyvale, Calif., who led the study 
published in today's Journal of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The environmental factors are unknown but may include chemical  
exposures, diet and smoking -- the last of which paradoxically seems 
to lessen the risk of developing Parkinson's, she said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 1 million Americans have Parkinson's, Tanner said,  
making it second only to Alzheimer's disease in frequency as a 
degenerative disease of the brain and nerves. 
</P>
<P>
	Parkinson causes slow deterioration of the nerves' ability to  
control the muscles. It usually starts with small tremors, then 
progresses to a shuffling gait and increasing weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no cure, and drug therapy tends to lose effectiveness  
over time. 
</P>
<P>
	A genetic cause is most common in the approximately 10 percent  
of people with the disease who are diagnosed before age 50, Tanner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, researchers identified a long-sought gene defect that  
can cause a form of Parkinson's, but the proportion of cases 
arising from the defect was unknown before this study. 
</P>
<P>
	In the new study, researchers tracked down more than 17,000 men  
enrolled in a World War II-era twin registry. The researchers found 
161 twin pairs in which at least one brother had Parkinson's 
disease and data on the pairs was complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 161 sets, there were 16 in which Parkinson's had  
struck before age 50. Of the four sets of identical twins -- who 
have exactly the same genetic material -- both brothers had 
Parkinson's. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 12 fraternal pairs, who share only half their genetic  
material, there were only two in which both brothers had 
Parkinson's. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers calculated that if one twin developed the disease by  
age 50, the other was six times more likely to get it if he were an 
identical twin than if he were a fraternal twin. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanner said environmental factors most likely to play a role in  
typical Parkinson's include exposure to chemicals such as 
pesticides and herbicides, diet and tobacco smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	The apparent protective effect of smoking was found in the twins  
and in previous research, Tanner said. 
</P>
<P>
	She and Dr. J. William Langston, president of the Parkinson's  
Institute and senior author, said the protection is probably real, 
perhaps caused by smoking's stimulation of the liver to produce 
enzymes that neutralize some toxin that would otherwise provoke 
Parkinson's. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there are about 2,000 chemicals in cigarette smoke, so we  
still have a big job ahead of us in finding what chemicals might 
actually be protective,'' Langston said. ``And we don't recommend 
smoking to prevent Parkinson's disease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An expert not involved in the study said it presents a  
compelling reason to search for better treatments, since the drugs 
now available may lessen symptoms but don't really attack the 
disease or prevent disability. 
</P>
<P>
	And surgery is promising but still largely experimental, noted  
Dr. Jeffrey Cummings of the University of California, Los Angeles. 
In an editorial accompanying the study, he recommended that the new 
findings should refocus research on environmental triggers for 
typical Parkinson's disease and genetic influences in early-onset 
disease.

<HEADLINE> How To Keep Bill Collectors Away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Q: I overextended myself with credit cards. While I fully intend  
to repay all my creditors, what can I do in the meantime to keep 
the bill collectors at bay? 

</P>
<P>
	A: First, put your overused plastic on ``ice'' for awhile. In  
other words: Stop using your credit cards to buy new stuff until 
you can afford to pay for the old stuff! 
</P>
<P>
	Some people do the ice part literally -- they remove all cards  
from their wallets and stick them in the freezer to avoid further 
temptation -- while they work out a plan to pay off their bills. 
</P>
<P>
	You can, in a sense, also leave bill collectors out in the cold  
for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	Collectors must stop contacting you if you tell them to do so in  
writing, although they're free to take other legal action against 
you, like garnishing wages. If the collector knows you have a 
lawyer, he or she must contact the lawyer, not you. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, on the books since 1977,  
sets ground rules for debt collectors and protects consumers from 
aggressive and abusive collection tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	It's important to know your rights should you fall behind in  
your bills and an outside collection agency is called in by a 
creditor. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the law, collectors can't, among other things, repeatedly  
use the telephone to harass or annoy you; send documents to you 
which look like court documents; use obscene language; discuss your 
credit problems with family or friends; threaten you with violence 
or damage to your reputation; or call or visit at inconvenient 
times or places, which generally means before 8 a.m. and after 9 
p.m., or on the job, if you've asked not to be contacted there. 
</P>
<P>
	If a bill collector violates the law, you can sue the collector.  
</P>
<P>
	Before it ever gets to that point, however, it's best to try to  
work things out with your creditors as early as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Center for Financial Education in San Diego offers  
three basic ground rules for dealing with creditors: ``Be honest, 
be humble, and be in touch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Take the first step by contacting all creditors ... Tell them  
what's happening ... Tell how much you can afford to pay and how 
often you can pay it. Then be ready to negotiate,'' the nonprofit 
group says. 
</P>
<P>
	If you prefer, groups like the National Foundation for Consumer  
Credit in Silver Spring, Md., can negotiate a repayment plan on 
your behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFCC has about 1,500 offices nationwide. For a nominal fee,  
counselors will not only work directly with the creditors but help 
you to better budget and fine-tune spending. (The NFCC phone number 
is (800) 388-2227; the Internet Web site is www.nfcc.org.)

<HEADLINE> 'Asterix and Obelix' Now a Movie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Asterix and Obelix, the Gallic warriors loved by  
comic book fans worldwide, are about to come to life in the most 
expensive film in French history. 
</P>
<P>
	While the word ``blockbuster'' is not usually associated with  
French movies, with a $48 million price tag, ``Asterix and Obelix 
Versus Caesar'' could redefine this country's cinema. 
</P>
<P>
	``Asterix'' has all the blockbuster ingredients in abundance:  
plenty of money, big stars and state-of-the-art special effects. 
</P>
<P>
	A week before director Claude Zidi's film is unleashed on the  
French public, the wheels on an intense promotional campaign are 
turning quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-producers TFI, a privately owned French TV network, and Renn  
Productions, run by film director Claude Berri, have a combined 
marketing budget of $446,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Shops are already overflowing with T-shirts, sweatshirts and  
scarves, and Asterix and Obelix dolls are likely to follow. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent issue of Paris Match magazine published 14 pages of  
photos featuring the film's stars: Gerard Depardieu; Italian actor 
Roberto Benigni; and Laetitia Casta, often called the new Brigitte 
Bardot. 
</P>
<P>
	The film is the first live action feature after several animated  
stories of the diminutive Asterix and his rotund pal, Obelix. 
</P>
<P>
	In the comic book series, their village, in the ancient region  
of Gaul, is the only one conquered by Julius Caesar. Men of simple 
pleasures, their aims are to bash as many Romans and devour as much 
roast boar as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1961, more than 150 million Asterix books, created by  
writer R. Goscinny and illustrator A. Uderzo, have been printed in 
more than 54 languages and dialects. 
</P>
<P>
	The film is due out in France on Feb. 3, and not long after in  
Italy, Germany, Greece, Switzerland, Belgium and Canada. There is 
no news yet of a distributor in the United States or England. 
</P>
<P>
	If all goes well, with 30 more installments to their story,  
Asterix and his friends could be around well into the new 
millennium.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Higher; Dow Up 24 Points / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened higher this morning, with computer  
stocks again leading the way and pushing the Nasdaq composite 
sharply higher. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average  
stood at 9,227.52, up 24.20. On Monday, the Dow ended at 9203.32 , 
up 82.65. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 23.54 at  
2,392.85. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 5.96 at 1,239.94. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues edged past advancers by 1,142 to 1,110 on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 87.49 million shares, 
down from Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq led the action on the Big Board, up 2 1/2 at 49 3/16, after  
the computer maker said it plans to spin off its AltaVista online 
search service into a separate, publicly traded company. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola was down 1 11/16 at 61 1/4. The beverage giant's  
fourth-quarter profits matched analysts' forecasts, but the 
year-over-year comparison suffered from economic slowdowns in key 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq stocks were led higher by Microsoft, up 3 7/8 at 165 3/4, and  
Intel, up 2 1/8 at 132 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.22 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.25 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.16 percent, and France's CAC-40 was 
down 0.11 percent.

<HEADLINE> Rome Mayor Demands New Olympic Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- The mayor demands a recount.  
</P>
<P>
	A new vote to assign the 2004 Summer Games is needed, Rome Mayor  
Francesco Rutelli said Tuesday, contending the choice of Athens, 
Greece, is now tainted by the Olympic bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very angry,'' Rutelli said. ``A panel of IOC experts and  
athletes gave Rome the No. 1 spot on the list of candidates. Until 
24 hours before the vote we were in the lead. And then -- who knows 
what happened?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after the International Olympic Committee ousted six  
members following revelations of corruption in the bidding process, 
Rutelli called for a committee of experts to carry out a new poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Athens beat Rome 66-41 in September 1997 in the final round of  
voting for the 2004 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing is to remove every shadow of doubt  
about the decision,'' he said. ``That would be a move to make clear 
what now is not clear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said Salt Lake City's 2002 bid committee spent $800,000  
on 14 IOC members, including travel expenses, scholarships for 
their children and cash payments. In addition to the expulsions, 
three IOC members quit. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC officials have said Salt Lake City will not be stripped of  
the 2002 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Athens has not been specifically targeted by the  
corruption inquiries, the IOC has said it will examine the 
selection process for the games from 1996 to 2006. 
</P>
<P>
	``Athens won, and I hope Athens won by fair play, but ... if  
there is an independent committee, perhaps the decision could be 
changed and shifted to another city,'' Rutelli said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that Italian members of the IOC told him at the time of  
the 1997 vote that ``many African and Latin American delegates 
changed their votes in the very last hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The head of Rome's failed bid, Raffaele Ranucci, told the ANSA  
news agency he didn't think the 2004 decision was affected by what 
he called ``those little games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always figured that the Greek capital was being paid  
back for not getting the 1996 Olympics,'' Ranucci said. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy is now trying to land the 2006 Winter Games, with Turin  
considered a notch behind Swiss front-runner Sion. 
</P>
<P>
	In Greece, the president of Hellenic Olympic Committee, Lambis  
Nikolaou, defended his city's 2004 triumph. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vote is closed,'' Nikolaou said. ``The games were given  
cleanly. The doors are open, the dogs are tied up and they can come 
and examine whatever they want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Athens Mayor Dimitris Avramopoulos: ``Nothing can reverse  
the vote taken by the International Olympic Committee. The things 
said by the otherwise thoroughly likable mayor of Rome, I must say, 
are groundless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--The opposition faction in Berlin's Senate sent the IOC files  
from the city's 1993 bid for the 2000 Games. Greens leader Judith 
Demba, who called the IOC a ``club of corrupt old men,'' said 
Berlin bidders spent $1.53 million on travel, lodging, car rental, 
gifts and other expenses for 56 IOC members who visited the city. 
</P>
<P>
	She claimed scores of presents exceeded the IOC limit of $150.  
Demba also said IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch charged the 
bid committee $3,724 for a domestic air ticket between Stuttgart 
and Berlin that normally would cost one-tenth the sum. 
</P>
<P>
	Walther Troeger, an IOC member and president of the German  
National Olympic Committee, said he did not expect the IOC to find 
proof of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	--In England, the head of Manchester's failed campaign for the  
2000 Games, said IOC members were taken to Wimbledon and Football 
Association Cup soccer games as part of a $9 million campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were in the business of showing people round,'' Bob Scott  
said. ``We were in the business of entertaining. We were in the 
business of, you know, sort of `gross hospitality' is the phrase 
that I think we can be accused of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Canadian swimmer Mark Tewksbury left his Olympic gold medal on  
a table at a news conference, saying it had lost its meaning 
because of the bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an Olympic gold medal, if anyone wants it,'' said  
Tewksbury, who won the 100-meter backstroke at the 1992 Barcelona 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Juan Antonio Samaranch should resign ... the entire IOC needs  
to be restructured. I'm here to defend Olympism, to defend the 
movement, not to defend the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Nagano police said IOC visitors received free rides on police  
helicopters during the city's successful bid for the 1998 Games. 
Nagano officials already have said IOC voters were given free trips 
to Kyoto, some IOC officials were entertained by geisha and 
Samaranch received an expensive painting and Japanese sword. 
</P>
<P>
	``What was offered was definitely not excessive -- it was  
normal,'' said Japanese Olympic Committee executive board member 
Chiharu Igaya, also an IOC executive board member. ``In business, 
entertainment is far more extravagant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--African sports authorities complain their IOC members were  
unfairly made the focus of the bribery scandal. Six Africans are 
among the nine members expelled or forced to resign and a seventh 
delegate is under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lavish gifts were presented at midnight, instead of being  
rolled on a trolley through a hotel lobby at noon,'' said Robert 
Magagula, vice president of Swaziland's Olympic committee. ``That 
happened to all IOC members, not just African members.''

<HEADLINE>  Aid Efforts Begin in Colombia Quake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Efforts to send emergency aid and supplies to an earthquake  
ravaged community in Colombia began to mobilize throughout the 
United States on Tuesday after hundreds were found dead. 
</P>
<P>
	From the New York City borough of Queens to Little Havana, a  
neighborhood in Miami, cardboard boxes were left on sidewalks and 
in storefronts to collect donations. A magnitude 6 quake crumbled 
nearly two-thirds of the western Colombian city of Armenia's 
buildings on Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The mood was somber at the Monserrate restaurant in Miami, a  
popular eatery and gathering spot for Colombians living in south 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very united, and very sad,'' said Jairo Lozano, who came  
to the United States 25 years ago from the Colombian capital of 
Bogota. ``There's a box here where people are dropping things off 
... food, canned goods, diapers for the children, medicine. We'll 
pack it up and send it off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami-Dade Fire Rescue's Urban Search and Rescue Task Force --  
the same team recognized for its work in the Oklahoma City bombing 
-- took off Tuesday to sift through the destruction. The 64-person 
team, equipped with 56,000 pounds of gear, will remain in the area 
about a week. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're bringing the most advanced listening and fiber optic  
devices to search for people trapped under rubble,'' said Lt. Luis 
Fernandez, a spokesman for Miami-Dade Fire Rescue. ``If we can get 
rescuers on scene within 24 hours ... the chance of survival is at 
its highest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In New York City, phone lines to the Colombian consulate were  
flooded with callers worried about relatives, but there was little 
information available. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of others phoned the New York offices of the Colombian  
RCN radio and television network, which is broadcasting rescue 
efforts and updating local viewers with lists of survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's crying over here,'' said Sandra Castaneda, who  
works at the station. ``People are bringing food, medicine. It's 
been absolutely crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The station plans to hold a telethon to aid the earthquake  
victims on Feb. 7. The consulate also is collecting supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Jackson Heights section of Queens, which is home to many  
Colombians, shopkeepers set out boxes early in the day so people 
could donate clothes and other necessities. 
</P>
<P>
	Marisol Munoz, 28, whose father lives in Armenia, said she was  
finally able to talk to him early in the day after hours of trying. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was trying to get him all day Monday but couldn't,'' she  
said. ``At night, I woke up every hour to call him. Finally, he 
called me and said he was all right.''

<HEADLINE>  Pope Arrives in St. Louis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Pope John Paul II arrived in St. Louis today  
for his fifth visit to the U.S. mainland and immediately compared 
America's old battles over racism and slavery to new ones over 
abortion and euthanasia. ``America faces a similar time of trial,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Recalling the U.S. Supreme Court's 1857 Dred Scott decision,  
which reduced slaves to property, the pope said there is today ``a 
culture that seeks to declare entire groups of human beings ... 
considered `unuseful' to be outside the boundaries of legal 
protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the airport ceremony -- the start of a 30-hour stay in St.  
Louis, following his triumphant five-day trip to Mexico -- he also 
called upon Americans to ``open wide your hearts'' to less 
fortunate people. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope was greeted by President Clinton. ``For 20 years you  
have lifted our spirits and touched our hearts,'' Clinton said. 
``For 20 years you have challenged of us to think of life not in 
terms of what we acquire for ourselves but in terms of what we give 
of ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president quoted a Polish phrase that means, ``May you live  
a hundred years and more.'' And he added: ``May you continue 
working and teaching and lighting the way. ... Welcome to the 
United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then the pope and the president met privately in a hangar, while  
Hillary Rodham Clinton greeted cardinals assembled for the pope's 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope has criticized U.S. policy on the death penalty,  
abortion and economic sanctions against Cuba and Iraq, and on 
Monday the Vatican condemned an American missile attack on Iraq. In 
a statement, spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said the bombing 
``confirms once again'' the pope's view that military measures 
``don't resolve problems in themselves, rather they aggravate 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The differences shouldn't dampen the pope's welcome for the  
visit. As many as 600,000 people were expected to turn out; more 
than 530,000 Catholics live in the St. Louis area. 
</P>
<P>
	When the papal plane landed at Lambert Airport, young people  
waiting at the Kiel Center to join the pope in a youth rally this 
evening reacted with a rousing cheer. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally is a fitting event because the pope is counting on  
young Catholics to battle what he calls a ``culture of death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, he is scheduled to celebrate Mass before 104,000  
people at the Trans World Dome. He also is to take part in an 
evening service at the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis before 
departing Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	His departure from Mexico City was an emotional one.  
</P>
<P>
	Spectators at the airport burst into tears, waving white and  
yellow handkerchiefs and chanting: ``Let him stay!'' 
Schoolchildren, religious officials and members of the crowd rushed 
onto the red carpet to kneel before the pope and kiss his hand as 
he made his way toward the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands of people lined the pope's route from the  
Vatican's nunciate, or embassy, to the airport, waving pennants 
emblazoned with the pope's portrait and the word ``adios.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``God bless you Mexico, for the loyalty and love your sons give  
to the church,'' the pope declared at a departure ceremony attended 
by President Ernesto Zedillo. 
</P>
<P>
	The pontiff also received a rousing farewell Monday evening  
inside the giant Azteca Stadium, where he decried drug trafficking, 
corruption and other evils of modern society. There, the frail, 
78-year-old pope rose from his chair and held up his arms to the 
crowd of 110,000 that chanted ``John Paul II, the world loves 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maria Teresa Pulido, 28, went to the Azteca Stadium celebration  
but said it wasn't enough. She returned with her 6-year-old son 
Rafael to the street at 2 a.m. to wait along John Paul's route. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to see him one more time. It's the last chance that  
I'll have,'' she said. ``He tells you with a strong conviction what 
you have to do for your children to prepare them for the new 
millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The visit to St. Louis is the pontiff's second leg of a mission  
to give new direction to his flock on the eve of the third 
millennium and to strengthen ties between Roman Catholics in North 
and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	In the course of his five days in Mexico, John Paul outlined  
church strategy throughout the Americas for the start of the new 
millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed a declaration containing that strategy. It also  
condemned the evils of exploitative capitalism, abortion, 
euthanasia and capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged Catholics to more vigorously defend their faith against  
Protestant sects that have made inroads in Latin America, and he 
stressed the need to preach to both rich and poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the strategy involves bringing civic leaders back into  
contact with the church.

<HEADLINE> Checkered Butterfly Said Endangered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- A checkered butterfly found only in the  
Sacramento Mountains of southern New Mexico is creating a rift 
between environmentalists and a village with growing pains. 
</P>
<P>
	The Southwest Center for Biological Diversity in Tucson, Ariz.,  
wants an emergency listing of the Cloudcroft checkerspot butterfly 
as a federally endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
	But the village of Cloudcroft, nestled atop the mountains at  
8,640 feet some 200 miles southeast of Albuquerque, wants access to 
140 acres of prime butterfly habitat that is now part of the 
Lincoln National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	The village -- population about 750 -- is asking the U.S. Forest  
Service for permission to use, and eventually annex, the land. 
</P>
<P>
	The village needs the acreage for recreation sites for children,  
expansion of its sewage treatment plant and for space to store 
maintenance equipment, administrator Curtis Schrader said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What about the kids?'' Schrader said Tuesday. ``Aren't they  
threatened, sensitive or endangered? Shouldn't they have adequate 
recreational areas?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The butterfly faces imminent extinction, said Noah Greenwald,  
ecologist for the center. He could not estimate the butterfly's 
population. 
</P>
<P>
	``The town there, in a way, is really blessed,'' Greenwald said.  
``It's surrounded by beautiful forest in the Sacramento Mountains. 
They should recognize that they would be better off protecting the 
natural state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Southwest Center filed its petition Monday with Interior  
Secretary Bruce Babbitt and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 
which has 90 days to determine if a petition warrants further 
consideration and a year to decide whether a species should be 
listed. 
</P>
<P>
	Another checkerspot -- the endangered Quino checkerspot butterfly  
-- has been the source of friction between home builders and 
conservationists in Riverside County, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cloudcroft butterfly is found only on high meadows in the  
Sacramentos, within a few miles of the village, Greenwald said. Two 
inches from wingtip-to-wingtip, the butterfly is checkered with 
white and deep orange squares separated by black bands. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1997 study by Renee Galeano-Popp, a former Forest Service  
biologist, estimated 6,000 acres of suitable habitat exists for the 
butterfly, and up to 2,000 acres are managed by the agency, 
Greenwald said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 70 percent of the butterfly's habitat is privately  
owned and threatened by development, he said. Other threats are 
campgrounds, grazing, weeds and pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
	Cloudcroft has been working for about 10 years to acquire about  
140 acres of Forest Service land next to the village. Most of the 
land would be used for baseball, softball and soccer fields, 
Schrader said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50 acres for the proposed maintenance yard is most worrisome  
to Greenwald's group. The land is prime habitat for the butterfly, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understand they have needs too, but we just want them to  
consider the severity of the situation -- that it's a tradeoff 
between a species going extinct and a maintenance yard,'' Greenwald 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The village has had to fend off other environmental punches in  
its quest for the land. ``Unfortunately, we've had to overcome -- or 
we're trying to overcome -- the Mexican spotted owl, the northern 
goshawk, the Sacramento Mountain salamander, a golden bladderpod 
and several species of thistles and now the Cloudcroft checkerspot 
butterfly,'' Schrader said. 
</P>
<P>
	The environmental groups feel like they are the self-appointed  
watchdogs ``to protect us small communities from ourselves,'' he 
said. ``They think we're out here willy-nilly trying to develop it. 
That's not the case.''

<HEADLINE> Free Tickets Cause Toronto Rampage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Free tickets for the Toronto Raptors' exhibition  
game against the Boston Celtics assured there would be a big crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	But the crowd -- larger than expected and anxious to grab the  
best available seats -- turned a nice gesture into an ugly scene 
Tuesday night at SkyDome. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were really caught off guard,'' said Jim Roe, director of  
event operations for Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment. ``We were 
a little overwhelmed by the number of people taking us up on our 
offer of free tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're really very sorry.''  
</P>
<P>
	So was Toronto teen-ager Daniel Segon, perhaps the worst of the  
several people injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just trying to get in and my head was pushed up against  
the door and it just shattered,'' the 16-year-old Segon said of the 
door. ``It was too rough for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Segon suffered several deep cuts in his right hand while  
protecting his head during the melee. Ambulance attendants called 
to the entrance of the upper deck wrapped his hand in gauze and 
examined several other people. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew someone was going to get hurt, I just didn't think it  
would happen to me,'' Segon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The surge of fans created a mini-stampede that left dozens of  
women and children in tears as well as four smashed doors and some 
broken turnstiles. No serious injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Only about a dozen SkyDome security guards were on duty when the  
gate opened at 5:30 p.m. Police and ambulances didn't arrive until 
things got out of control. 
</P>
<P>
	The melee eased once Raptors officials removed the turnstiles.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate,'' said Richard Peddie, president of Maple  
Leaf Sports and Entertainment Ltd. ``We never anticipated this kind 
of a turnout.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans began lining up as early as noon because of the free-ticket  
offer -- part of the NBA's plan to win back fans following the 
lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	But the organized lineup turned into an uncontrollable mob when  
thousands of fans arrived later in the day. It was so crowded that 
the faces of the people in the front of the line were being smeared 
against the glass doors. 
</P>
<P>
	Bodies got caught between the doors when they opened, and people  
were tripping over each other as they scrambled to get the best of 
the 10,000 free seats. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar incident happened at SkyDome on April 25, 1995. People  
stampeded through a gate when the Toronto Blue Jays tried to win 
back fans after the baseball strike by offering free seats in the 
upper deck. 
</P>
<P>
	Once things calmed down Tuesday night, about 8,000 fans found  
seats in the upper level while about the same amount of Raptors 
season-ticket holders filled the lower section. 
</P>
<P>
	The Raptors have also offered free upper-level tickets to three  
upcoming regular-season games, two at SkyDome and one at Maple Leaf 
Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
	Roe said the team would re-examine how it handles the free seats  
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	On the court, Ron Mercer scored 25 points -- including Boston's  
first 11 -- as the Celtics beat the Raptors 106-88. 
</P>
<P>
	Antoine Walker added 19 points for the Celtics. Kenny Anderson,  
who refused to play for the Raptors last season after being 
acquired for Damon Stoudamire, was booed every time he touched the 
ball. Anderson finished with 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Christie led the Raptors with 16 points and Kevin Willis  
added 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto trailed by 12 points after the first five minutes and  
didn't make a basket until Charles Oakley put back an offensive 
rebound at 5:55 of the first quarter.

<HEADLINE> Superstitious? Not These Guys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Super Bowl Special    	
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Since their uniforms were redesigned last year, the  
Denver Broncos have never lost a game wearing their sharp dark blue 
jerseys with the orange piping. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-one games. Twenty-one wins.  
</P>
<P>
	Is there a pattern here? Quarterback John Elway hopes not. He  
not good about superstitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started getting superstitious about being superstitious,''  
he said. ``As you get older, you stop remembering what it was 
you're supposed to be superstitious about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consider though that in Sunday's Super Bowl against Atlanta, the  
Broncos have been designated as the road team and will wear their 
white shirts. That's the same color they wore when they suffered 
their only losses this season, the last one in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Uhh-ohh.  
</P>
<P>
	Safety Steve Atwater smirked at the suggestion that jersey  
colors count. ``The uniforms are no big deal,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shows how much he knows.  
</P>
<P>
	When Jerry Glanville became coach of the Falcons in 1990, one of  
the first things he did was dump the team's namby-pamby red shirts 
for more foreboding black jerseys and black helmets, hoping perhaps 
to convey some subliminal message of strength to his players. The 
Falcons responded with a 5-11 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were totally illegal my first year,'' said Glanville, now  
covering the NFL for HBO and Fox Sports. ``You're supposed to have 
a year's lead time on changing. They said we'd be fined every time 
we wore it. I was never noted for following a lot of rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Falcons souvenirs went from 28th to the top 10. ``I  
think they dropped the fines when that happened,'' Glanville said. 
``If somebody paid them, they didn't tell me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was the matter of Al Davis, who threatened to sue.  
</P>
<P>
	``Davis thought he had the patent on black,'' Glanville said.  
``We went in there and beat the Raiders. We showed Al who deserved 
to wear black and who didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was in Atlanta's 10-6 season in 1991, when people began to  
think that maybe this black business was working. Then the color 
scheme went into a prolonged slump as the Falcons struggled through 
consecutive 6-10 seasons. Glanville was sent packing but the black 
shirts and helmets stayed and made an impression. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kevin Greene came up to me one time and said, `Coach, you know  
the best thing you ever did in the NFL?' '' Glanville said. ``I 
told him I shut out Miami one time, held Dan Marino to 13 yards 
passing. He said, `Naah, you brought the best looking uniform to 
the NFL.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Let others worry about jersey colors and subliminal messages.  
Linebacker Jessie Tuggle, who went from Atlanta's crimson shirts to 
Glanville's black wardrobe, thinks it's all fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not superstitious at all,'' he said. ``I don't do anything  
the same way twice. I get mentally and physically ready before 
every game. That's my superstition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback Ray Buchanan said some of the Falcons insist on  
little cosmetic touches before each game, making sure they look the 
same way they did the week before. ``But it's not a big deal,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And tackle Bob Whitfield said he had no superstitions, either.  
But when offensive line coach Art Shell suggests that on a given 
day the up-front guys all wear the same colors, why they all wear 
the same colors. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwater's casual approach to the matter of the blue jersey  
streak suggests that the Broncos are not superstitious. Not true. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah,'' Atwater admitted grudgingly. ``I guess we have some  
superstitions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is, for example, the matter of where the players park  
their cars at Denver International Airport when the team is leaving 
on a road trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all have to park on the first level,'' Atwater said. ``They  
know we're coming. They know we want to do that and they set the 
spaces aside for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At home, Atwater follows another driving regimen. ``I never go  
home from the stadium the same way I came,'' he said. ``I always 
have to use a different route, even if it's out of the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's no sense tempting the fates.

<HEADLINE>  Pope Arrives in St. Louis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Pope John Paul II arrived in St. Louis today  
for his fifth visit to the U.S. mainland and immediately compared 
America's old battles over racism and slavery to new ones over 
abortion and euthanasia. ``America faces a similar time of trial,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Recalling the U.S. Supreme Court's 1857 Dred Scott decision,  
which reduced slaves to property, the pope said there is today ``a 
culture that seeks to declare entire groups of human beings ... 
considered `unuseful' to be outside the boundaries of legal 
protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the airport ceremony -- the start of a 30-hour stay in St.  
Louis, following his triumphant five-day trip to Mexico -- he also 
called upon Americans to ``open wide your hearts'' to less 
fortunate people. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope was greeted by President Clinton. ``For 20 years you  
have lifted our spirits and touched our hearts,'' Clinton said. 
``For 20 years you have challenged of us to think of life not in 
terms of what we acquire for ourselves but in terms of what we give 
of ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president quoted a Polish phrase that means, ``May you live  
a hundred years and more.'' And he added: ``May you continue 
working and teaching and lighting the way. ... Welcome to the 
United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then the pope and the president met privately in a hangar, while  
Hillary Rodham Clinton greeted cardinals assembled for the pope's 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope has criticized U.S. policy on the death penalty,  
abortion and economic sanctions against Cuba and Iraq, and on 
Monday the Vatican condemned an American missile attack on Iraq. In

<HEADLINE> Architect Charles Luckman Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Charles Luckman, an industrialist and  
architect who helped design the Prudential Center in Boston, New 
York's Madison Square Garden and several Los Angeles landmarks, 
died Tuesday. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	Luckman, whose architectural firm designed the original control  
tower at Los Angeles International Airport and his namesake $22 
million Arts Complex at California State University, Los Angeles, 
died in his sleep at his Los Angeles home, said Nancy Hogan, 
executive vice president of Luckman Management Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Kansas City, Mo., Luckman was trained as an architect  
but first found success in the soap business. Time magazine put the 
soap salesman on its cover in 1937 as the ``Boy Wonder'' of 
American industry. 
</P>
<P>
	He became president of Pepsodent Co. at age 30 and president of  
Lever Brothers seven years later, where he influenced the design of 
the soap maker's 21-story headquarters, Lever House. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's Landmark Commission later proclaimed Lever House, the  
first glass and steel skyscraper on Park Avenue, ``among the first, 
as well as the most famous, corporate expressions of the Modern 
International Style in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Presidents from Harry S. Truman to George Bush asked for  
Luckman's advice on philanthropic or volunteer efforts such as the 
Citizen's Food Committee, a post-World War II effort to bring food 
to Europe, Hogan said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1950, he left Lever Brothers and established his architecture  
firm in Los Angeles, where he mixed his design ideas with 
conservative business principles, introducing market research to 
architecture. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1982, he became the first architect to be awarded the  
American Management Association's Gantt Medal for distinguished 
achievement of management as a community service, Hogan said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Luckman built buildings, he asked what workers in an office  
building or hospital patients or sports fans wanted. His Aloha 
Stadium was the first sports complex with stands that moved on an 
``air film'' to provide sight lines for both football and baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Other projects included Aloha Stadium in Hawaii, the original  
Los Angeles Convention Center and the Manned Space Craft Center in 
Houston, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Luckman is survived by his wife, Harriet; and sons, Charles Jr.,  
James and Stephen; eight grandchildren, and six great 
grandchildren.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dow Jones &AMP; Co. posted a much smaller  
fourth-quarter loss in 1998 after selling its ailing financial 
information service but still was hurt by declining advertising at 
The Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, The Washington Post Co. reported its  
fourth-quarter profit fell 30 percent compared to 1997, when 
results were boosted by gains from selling interests in two 
companies. 
</P>

	Profit at McGraw-Hill Cos., publisher of Business Week magazine,  
jumped 11 percent on growth at its Standard &AMP; Poor's financial

months of 1998, compared to a loss of $889.3 million, or $9.22 per 
share, in the same period a year earlier. The 1997 results were 
plagued by losses from Dow Jones Markets, the electronic financial 
data unit that was sold to Bridge Information Systems Inc. in May 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue fell to $491.9 million from $689.5 million last year,  
reflecting the loss of revenue from Dow Jones Markets and weaker 
advertising from financial services companies amid volatility in 
global stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the advertising slowdown, the recent quarter's  
loss was blamed on costs related to the Markets sale, severance 
payments, technology costs and terminating some real estate leases. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding those special costs and gains on two separate  
investments, Dow Jones earned $55.4 million, or 59 cents per share, 
in the fourth quarter -- a penny above Wall Street estimates, 
according to First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Jones shares finished unchanged at $45.31 1/4 on the New York  
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating profits from print publishing, which includes the  
Journal and Barron's magazine, dropped 72 percent to $19.2 million 
on the advertising decline. But profit from its Ottaway community 
newspapers group jumped 39 percent to $19.6 million as advertising 
in those publications increased. 
</P>
<P>
	A loss at Dow Jones' electronic publishing unit narrowed to $1.3  
million, 42 percent smaller than the previous year. Losses from its 
television operations shrank 65 percent to $2.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Since selling the Markets unit, Dow Jones has announced several  
measures aimed at improving profits, including job cuts, stock 
buybacks and broader distribution agreements for its Dow Jones 
Newswires service. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Dow Jones earned $8.4 million, or 9 cents a share,  
reversing the 1997 loss of $802 million, or $8.36 a share, which 
was due to Dow Jones Markets. Revenue fell to $2.16 billion from 
$2.57 billion. 

</P>
<P>
 *The Washington Post Co.    	
</P>
<P>
	The publisher of The Washington Post and Newsweek magazine  
earned $63.8 million, or $6.30 a share, in the three months ended 
Jan. 3. A year earlier, the company earned $91 million, or $8.63 a 
share, including a gain of $28.5 million from selling stakes in two 
newsprint and timber companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 13 percent to $591.4 million from $522.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the special gains in 1997, profits for the recent  
quarter increased 2 percent, but came in below analysts' estimates 
for profits of $6.63 per share. Washington Post Co. stock fell 
$11.37 1/2, or 2 percent, to $579.62 1/2 a share on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher advertising boosted the newspaper division's revenue by 7  
percent, while magazine revenue climbed 1 percent and broadcast 
revenue rose 9 percent. Revenue from the company's cable systems 
increased 7 percent due to rate increases. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Washington Post Co. earned $471.3 million, or  
$41.10 a share, up from $281.6 million, or $26.15 a share, in 1997. 
Revenue rose to $2.11 billion from $1.96 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 results were boosted by a gain of $194.4 million from  
the sale of its stake in Cowles Media Co., 14 small cable systems 
and a provider of electronic shopping services for Internet sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 profit included gains of $44.5 million from selling the  
newsprint and timber stakes as well as a regional cable sports 
network. Excluding both years' gains, the company's profit 
decreased 6 percent in 1998. 

</P>
<P>
 *McGraw-Hill Cos.    	
</P>
<P>
	McGraw-Hill earned $74.5 million, or 75 cents a share, in the  
October-December quarter, up from $67 million, or 67 cents a share, 
in 1997. Revenue rose 4 percent to $938.2 million from $900.8 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The results matched analysts' expectations, but McGraw-Hill  
shares fell $3.93 3/4, or 3.5 percent, to $108.93 3/4 on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's financial services division was the biggest  
contributor, as operating profits at Standard &AMP; Poor's rose 11.5 
percent to $84.4 million on growth in its international operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating profits from educational and professional publishing  
jumped 26 percent to $22.4 million. Rising demand for school 
textbooks boosted revenue 2 percent in what is traditionally the 
division's slowest quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The gains in those two divisions offset a decline at  
McGraw-Hill's media and information services unit, where operating 
profits slipped 5.5 percent to $49.2 million despite rising profits 
and advertising at Business Week. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, McGraw-Hill earned $333.1 million, or $3.35 a  
share, up from $290.7 million, or $2.91 a share, in 1997. Revenue 
rose to $3.73 billion from $3.53 billion.

<HEADLINE> Ark. Might OK Concealed Guns Church </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Holy heat. There could be a gun under  
that choir robe or churchgoer's jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	A legislator has introduced a bill to let people with  
concealed-gun permits bear their arms in church. 
</P>
<P>
	Constituents want the privilege because sometimes they must go  
straight from work to weeknight church services and can't get home 
to drop off their guns, state Rep. Stephen Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
	He introduced a bill Monday to relax the state's  
concealed-weapons ban in houses of worship, as well as in parks, 
sports events and bars. Guns still would be barred from schools, 
state offices, courthouses and airports. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon doesn't think there will be any danger.  
</P>
<P>
	``Statistics will show that there have been no instances where  
guns have been pulled and innocent people have been hurt,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ministers and church officers in Kentucky may carry guns inside  
church, under a provision enacted last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Arkansas, states that prohibit people with  
concealed-weapons permits from carrying guns in church are Georgia, 
Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, 
Texas and Wyoming.

<HEADLINE> Doctor: DiMaggio Battling Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	One of Joe DiMaggio's doctors said the baseball great is making  
progress in his recovery from lung cancer surgery and postoperative 
infections that nearly killed him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is progressing nicely since his discharge from Memorial  
Regional Hospital one week ago,'' Dr. Earl Barron said in a 
statement faxed to The Associated Press on Monday. ``Over the 
weekend, his physical therapy has progressed to the point that he 
is walking. Reports of his condition worsening are not true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio also was recovering from the shock of seeing a report  
on television that he had died. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was livid,'' his lawyer and neighbor, Morris Engelberg,  
said Monday. ``Then I made him laugh. I said, `Joe, we must be in 
heaven together.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The two were watching television at DiMaggio's home in  
Hollywood, Fla., when the report appeared as a ``crawl'' across the 
screen during the ``Dateline NBC'' program Sunday. NBC said a 
technician in the network's New York control room had inadvertently 
sent the report. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC delivered an apology to DiMaggio through Engelberg's office  
on Monday, spokesman Cory Shields said. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio has had a rocky recovery from his surgery on Oct. 12,  
but according to Engelberg, he is battling back again. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's walking. He's taking therapy.'' Engelberg said. ``And he  
will be at opening day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees owner George Steinbrenner said last week when DiMaggio  
was discharged from the hospital, ``Joe will certainly toss out the 
first ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees open their home schedule April 9 with a day game  
against the Detroit Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's my goal now, to have Joe at opening day,'' Engleberg  
said. ``My first goal was to have him get out of the hospital, and 
that happened. A lot of people didn't think it would. He's 
miraculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner had wanted DiMaggio to throw out the ceremonial  
first pitch at last fall's World Series, but DiMaggio was in the 
hospital by then.

<HEADLINE> Ravens Name Lewis Coordinator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Brian Billick's new defensive coordinator won't  
need to spend much time getting to know the players on the 
Baltimore Ravens. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because Marvin Lewis is already familiar with just about  
everyone on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Billick announced Tuesday that he will bring back Lewis, who  
served as the Ravens' defensive coordinator for three seasons under 
coach Ted Marchibroda. 
</P>
<P>
	Marchibroda and his staff, including Lewis, were fired on Dec.  
28. 
</P>
<P>
	Billick, hired as head coach last week, also announced Tuesday  
the hiring of Russ Purnell as special teams coach; Wade Harman as 
tight ends coach; Jeff Friday as strength and conditioning coach; 
and Jack Del Rio as linebackers coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pleased that we've been able to attract quality assistants  
that bring a wealth of experience and expertise to Baltimore,'' 
Billick said. ``We're better today than we were yesterday because 
of these hires.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under Lewis, the Ravens held the opposition to 17 points or less  
in half the games this season. Lewis also helped develop 
linebackers Peter Boulware and Ray Lewis into Pro Bowl stars. 
</P>
<P>
	But Marvin Lewis was a bitter man upon being fired, and said at  
the time that a lack of money in the wake of the team's move from 
Cleveland hindered efforts to build a winner in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the thing that was overlooked. We cut our best  
receiver, the best leader on defense and the second-best leader,'' 
Lewis said. ``I was told we were going to do certain things that we 
never did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said that several players were turned off by the exodus  
from Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of guys who didn't trust Ted, me or even Mr.  
Modell because they felt they were betrayed,'' Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	He later apologized for the remarks, and his hiring Tuesday is  
evidence that all is forgiven.

<HEADLINE> Court Reinstates Hubbell Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A divided federal appeals court today  
reinstated a tax evasion case against presidential friend Webster 
Hubbell, but raised serious questions whether prosecutor Kenneth 
Starr can use Hubbell's own records to prosecute him. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that a federal judge overstepped  
his authority when he threw out the tax charges against the four 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Congress's  
independent counsel arrangements. ... It is not for lower court 
judges to undercut that decision by constructions of the Act that 
prevent this Independent Counsel from performing his duty in a 
manner reasonably approximating that of an ordinary prosecutor,'' 
the court held in two 2-1 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision means that Hubbell, who already has served one  
prison sentence, now faces two additional criminal trials involving 
Starr's office, which alleges he cheated his on taxes and 
obstructed investigators in the Whitewater investigation. The 
obstruction case was brought by Starr late last year while the 
appeal was pending in the tax case. 
</P>
<P>
	In throwing out the tax case against Hubbell, U.S. District  
Judge James Robertson said Starr should have gotten the approval of 
Attorney General Janet Reno in order to bring the charges and that 
Starr had unfairly used Hubbell's own financial records against him 
in assembling evidence against the former associate attorney 
general. Hubbell had turned over the records to Starr under a 
limited grant of immunity known as production immunity. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court validated Starr's theory of the case -- that he  
was entitled to bring the charges based on evidence that hundreds 
of thousands of dollars he was paid by friends of President Clinton 
may have been ``hush money'' to ensure his silence in Starr's 
Whitewater probe. 
</P>
<P>
	``The timing, sources, and extent of the payments make the  
belief that they were hush money reasonable,'' said the appeals 
court. That suffices to bring the charges, the court added. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court, however, questioned the extent to which Starr  
can rely on the documents he collected from Hubbell in prosecuting 
the longtime friend of the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr, said the appeals court, must establish that it knew  
before collecting the documents that they existed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless the Independent Counsel can establish its knowledge of  
the existence and possession of the documents sought in the 
subpoena with greater detail and particularity, it will have to 
live with the consequences of its decision to compel production,'' 
the appeals court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Accordingly, should the Independent Counsel prove unable to  
meet the requisite evidentiary burden, the contents of those 
documents will be inadmissible,'' the court ruled, pointing to a 
serious Fifth Amendment issue that the prosecutor must overcome if 
he is to prosecute Hubbell. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax case against Hubbell, his wife, his tax preparer and his  
tax lawyer stemmed from hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
payments to the former law partner of Hillary Rodham Clinton by 
friends of the Clintons in 1994 after he had resigned from the 
Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr began delving into the payments at a time when Hubbell was  
supposed to be cooperating with the prosecutor in his criminal 
investigation of the Clintons' Whitewater dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-count grand jury indictment charged that by late 1997,  
the alleged evasion involved taxes, interest and penalties for 
1989-1992, 1994 and 1995 exceeding $894,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell ``performed little or no work'' for the consulting fees  
he received in 1994 from friends of the president at a time when 
Hubbell was under investigation by Starr's office, Starr alleged in 
the indictment.

<HEADLINE> US Admits Iraq Missile Went Astray </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon acknowledged for the first time  
Tuesday that an Air Force missile considered to be among its most 
accurate went astray during an attack on Iraqi air defenses and 
struck a residential area. Iraq has claimed it killed a number of 
civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Bacon, spokesman for Defense Secretary William Cohen,  
said a rocket-powered missile known as the AGM-130, one of the Air 
Force's newest weapons, ``did miss its target'' by a few miles. He 
said the Air Force had not yet determined what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	The missile landed in the al-Jumhuriya neighborhood outside of  
Basra, a port city in southern Iraq where U.S. planes have attacked 
air defenses almost daily in response to increased Iraqi challenges 
to enforcement of a ``no-fly'' zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraqi officials said five people were killed and 42 were injured  
by a missile that fell in al-Jumhuriya. They said another missile 
hit the village of Abu Falous outside Basra, where six people 
reportedly died and 17 were injured. Reporters who visited the 
al-Jumhuriya on Monday said four homes were destroyed and six were 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said only one U.S. missile went astray.  
</P>
<P>
	``It created some damage, we realize that and we regret any  
civilian casualties, but this was done in response to a provocative 
attack against our planes by Saddam Hussein,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have any independent estimate of casualties or  
fatalities that can back up what the Iraqis have said about this,'' 
Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related development, Bacon and other administration  
officials acknowledged Tuesday that American warplanes patrolling 
the skies over northern and southern Iraq are operating under new 
guidance that authorizes more aggressive action against Iraqi air 
defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're acting here in self-defense and in response to concerted  
attacks by Saddam Hussein,'' Sandy Berger, the president's national 
security adviser, said in an interview with defense reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said Monday's attacks illustrated the more aggressive  
approach that U.S. military commanders requested and President 
Clinton approved after the four-day bombing campaign by U.S. and 
British planes in mid-December that marked a turning point in the 
Iraqi conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, the Pentagon had denied there was any change in  
approach, although Gen. Anthony Zinni, commander of U.S. forces in 
the Persian Gulf area, said Monday that American pilots are 
responding to more aggressive and more closely coordinated Iraqi 
air defense tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a clear indication that this is orchestrated and  
obviously is part of the declared objective by the Iraqi leaders to 
violate the no-fly zone sanctions and to shoot down our planes,'' 
Zinni said. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said U.S. pilots are using ``more expansive rules of  
engagement'' to attack not only air defense radars that target 
allied planes and the surface-to-air missiles that occasionally are 
fired at them, but also communications and other facilities linked 
to Iraq's air defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since Saddam has more systematically challenged our  
enforcement of the no-fly zone, our pilots understand and our Air 
Force understands that if there are violations of the no-fly zone 
... that our response as appropriate will be against any of the air 
defense systems that we think make us vulnerable,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The AGM-130, the Air Force missile that missed its target Monday  
in Iraq is a newly modified weapon with a 2,000-pound, 
high-explosive warhead. It is equipped with a guidance system that 
enables the crew of the launching aircraft to watch the missile's 
path on a television monitor and steer it to its target. It also 
can be used with automatic weapon guidance. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufactured by Boeing Co., the 12-foot missile was first used  
in combat in Bosnia in 1995, Bacon said. Key characteristics of the 
$300,000 weapon are classified secret. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, the Pentagon reported one Iraqi violation of the  
``no-fly'' zone in northern Iraq and two in the south. 
</P>
<P>
	In the north, a Marine Corps EA-6B electronic warfare plane  
fired a high-speed anti-radiation missile after being targeted with 
radar at an Iraqi air defense site near the city of Mosul, 
officials said. Results of the Prowler attack, which occurred about 
6 a.m. EST, were unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, F-15E strike aircraft fired guided bombs and an AGM-130  
missile at anti-aircraft artillery emplacements and surface-to-air 
missile sites, also in northern Iraq, the Pentagon said. Details of 
the results of those attacks were not available. 
</P>
<P>
	In Baghdad, Saddam urged Iraqis to be patient in the battle  
against the United States: ``Your blood will not go in vain,'' he 
said in a speech carried by the official Iraqi News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger, asked to assess the strength of Saddam's hold on power,  
said he detects ``a certain desperation'' by an Iraqi leader 
isolated even from his fellow Arab leaders in the region. However, 
he did not think Saddam was ``teetering,'' and cautioned against 
raising expectations that U.S. assistance to Iraqi opposition 
groups would lead to Saddam's demise.

<HEADLINE>  Mark McGwire Honored in St. Louis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- This year's St. Louis Baseball Man of the year  
was a no-brainer: Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	The home run king, wrapping up his first visit to town since  
hitting No. 70 on Sept. 27, was honored Monday night by the St. 
Louis chapter of the Baseball Writers Association of America. 
Cardinals teammates still are shaking their heads at his 
accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the most fun year I've ever had, just being a part of  
that,'' pitcher Kent Mercker said. ``It was a blast, and I hope it 
happens again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire came to town three days before the pope's arrival and  
seemingly created the same sort of stir. During his two-hour 
autograph session Sunday at the team's annual winter charity event, 
fans who weren't lucky enough to have won in a raffle for his 
signature crowded around him just for a glimpse. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals Hall of Famer Bob Gibson, among the honorees at the  
sold-out dinner, said McGwire's feat wasn't the biggest surprise to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``What surprised me is the pitchers kept throwing to him,'' said  
Gibson, now a special assistant to American League president Gene 
Budig. ``I would have challenged him. Maybe I had better control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A highlight of the dinner was an auction for a signed drawing  
depicting McGwire atop a horse. Among the bidders were wives of the 
Cardinals' owners and Cheryl Smith, wife of Missouri football coach 
Larry Smith, who bowed out at $7,500. 
</P>
<P>
	The drawing ended up fetching $11,000 from a mystery bidder at  
the back of the room who turned out to be Phil Ozersky, the man who 
caught McGwire's 70th home run ball and turned it into a $2.7 
million profit. 
</P>
<P>
	During a lull in the auction, McGwire stepped in for master of  
ceremonies Bob Costas and got the bidding rolling. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is worth more than the ball,'' McGwire said. ``I touched  
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire signed the picture: ``To Phil, nice catch!''  
</P>
<P>
	The only thing missing from McGwire's visit was a summit meeting  
with Pope John Paul II, who's in town Tuesday and Wednesday. 
McGwire was raised Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, it's not going to be able to work out,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other headliners at the sold-out dinner, which attracted 2,000  
fans, were New York Yankees manager Joe Torre and baseball 
commissioner Bud Selig. Torre was fired by the Cardinals in 1995 
after five years as manager, but his Yankees set a major-league 
record last year with 114 victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig was being honored for meritorious service to baseball.  
</P>
<P>
	Three Cardinals players were on the list of award-winners;  
outfielder Ray Lankford for outstanding achievement, catcher Eli 
Marrero as the team's rookie of the year, and new outfielder Eric 
Davis for his comeback from colon cancer. Former Cardinals 
outfielder Brian Jordan, who signed a free-agent deal with Atlanta, 
also was honored for outstanding achievements in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Other honorees included Cardinals Hall of Famer Lou Brock,  
Indians first baseman Jim Thome, Smith and Missouri players Corby 
Jones and Devin West, bowler Pete Weber, umpire Rich Rieker and 
golfer Bob Goalby. Rieker, who is from St. Louis, was working when 
McGwire hit his first and 70th home runs last season, as well as 
his 400th career homer. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who threw a touchdown pass at the Senior Bowl on Sunday,  
felt a little out of place given the baseball theme. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel I shouldn't be here,'' Jones said. ``But hey, I'll take  
it.''

	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Ron Harper walked onto the court, looked  
around at the players milling about for the Chicago Bulls' media 
day and shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
	There's Bill Wennington, that's one player he knows. That guy  
over there is Martin ... Martin ... well, Martin Something. And 
that one is Charles ... ah, forget it. With all the Bulls' comings 
and goings, Harper was not even going to bother with the ``Hello, 
my name is ...'' game. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're used to calling out (certain) guys names and you're  
used to seeing them,'' Harper said Tuesday. ``I'm not used to 
seeing these guys just yet. It's only my third day here, so it's 
going to take awhile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's not the only one. In years past, the Bulls' media day was  
like a circus, with huge clusters of reporters and cameras fighting 
just to get in the same area code as Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen 
and Dennis Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, reporters clutched their rosters so they would know  
who that player was they had just interviewed. And instead of being 
able to hang back on the side, taking everything in, Harper was the 
main attraction Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The media day got cut down real, real big time,'' he said.  
``But we're a new team, we're not the old Bulls. We don't have the 
old guys here, so we have to get used to what we have here now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only starter left from last year's championship team, Harper  
better than anyone symbolized just how much Chicago has lost. The 
one player who was liked by everyone, he was close friends with 
Jordan and Pippen. The three often trained together at Jordan's 
house, and when His Airness decided to hang up his shoes, Harper 
and Pippen were the first teammates he told. 
</P>
<P>
	But now Jordan is on the golf course, Pippen is making big bucks  
in Houston and Harper is left behind to help rebuild. Picked as 
captain by new coach Tim Floyd, it falls to him to show the rookies 
and young guys what it takes to play at the championship level. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing I'll try to show them and try to tell them is  
in order to be a very good player, you must train hard,'' he said. 
``I knew this was going to be a very long year, so I trained hard 
and I expect to go out and play basketball. That's my plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he's got three championship rings, Harper's NBA career  
hasn't exactly been a romp. He was drafted by Cleveland, and he 
spent 4 1/2 seasons with the L.A. Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	At 35, he has seen the very good and the very bad.  
</P>
<P>
	``I asked Harper how old he was and I went 'Wow,''' said Roy  
Rogers, who came to the Bulls as part of the Rockets' 
sign-and-trade deal for Pippen. ``We're definitely going to turn to 
him for leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Grandfather Harper,'' Harper said with a laugh. ``That's me.''  
</P>
<P>
	Harper knows this won't be an easy season. Of the 20 players  
currently on the Bulls roster -- the list has to be pared to 14 by 
the start of the season -- only six have five or more years 
experience in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	And, after 10 years of being beaten up by the Bulls, the rest of  
the NBA is going to be looking to give back as good as it got. Who 
cares if Nos. 23 and 33 are gone? The uniform still says ``Bulls'' 
on the front.

<HEADLINE>  Mark McGwire Honored in St. Louis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- This year's St. Louis Baseball Man of the year  
was a no-brainer: Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	The home run king, wrapping up his first visit to town since  
hitting No. 70 on Sept. 27, was honored Monday night by the St. 
Louis chapter of the Baseball Writers Association of America. 
Cardinals teammates still are shaking their heads at his 
accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the most fun year I've ever had, just being a part of  
that,'' pitcher Kent Mercker said. ``It was a blast, and I hope it 
happens again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire came to town three days before the pope's arrival and  
seemingly created the same sort of stir. During his two-hour 
autograph session Sunday at the team's annual winter charity event, 
fans who weren't lucky enough to have won in a raffle for his 
signature crowded around him just for a glimpse. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals Hall of Famer Bob Gibson, among the honorees at the  
sold-out dinner, said McGwire's feat wasn't the biggest surprise to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``What surprised me is the pitchers kept throwing to him,'' said  
Gibson, now a special assistant to American League president Gene 
Budig. ``I would have challenged him. Maybe I had better control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A highlight of the dinner was an auction for a signed drawing  
depicting McGwire atop a horse. Among the bidders were wives of the 
Cardinals' owners and Cheryl Smith, wife of Missouri football coach 
Larry Smith, who bowed out at $7,500. 
</P>
<P>
	The drawing ended up fetching $11,000 from a mystery bidder at  
the back of the room who turned out to be Phil Ozersky, the man who 
caught McGwire's 70th home run ball and turned it into a $2.7 
million profit. 
</P>
<P>
	During a lull in the auction, McGwire stepped in for master of  
ceremonies Bob Costas and got the bidding rolling. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is worth more than the ball,'' McGwire said. ``I touched  
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire signed the picture: ``To Phil, nice catch!''  
</P>
<P>
	The only thing missing from McGwire's visit was a summit meeting  
with Pope John Paul II, who's in town Tuesday and Wednesday. 
McGwire was raised Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, it's not going to be able to work out,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other headliners at the sold-out dinner, which attracted 2,000  
fans, were New York Yankees manager Joe Torre and baseball 
commissioner Bud Selig. Torre was fired by the Cardinals in 1995 
after five years as manager, but his Yankees set a major-league 
record last year with 114 victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig was being honored for meritorious service to baseball.  
</P>
<P>
	Three Cardinals players were on the list of award-winners;  
outfielder Ray Lankford for outstanding achievement, catcher Eli 
Marrero as the team's rookie of the year, and new outfielder Eric 
Davis for his comeback from colon cancer. Former Cardinals 
outfielder Brian Jordan, who signed a free-agent deal with Atlanta, 
also was honored for outstanding achievements in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Other honorees included Cardinals Hall of Famer Lou Brock,  
Indians first baseman Jim Thome, Smith and Missouri players Corby 
Jones and Devin West, bowler Pete Weber, umpire Rich Rieker and 
golfer Bob Goalby. Rieker, who is from St. Louis, was working when 
McGwire hit his first and 70th home runs last season, as well as 
his 400th career homer. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who threw a touchdown pass at the Senior Bowl on Sunday,  
felt a little out of place given the baseball theme. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel I shouldn't be here,'' Jones said. ``But hey, I'll take  
it.''

<HEADLINE> 3 Witnesses Picked in Clinton Case </HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writers    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors have decided to ask the  
Senate for permission to call three witnesses at President 
Clinton's impeachment trial -- Monica Lewinsky, presidential friend 
Vernon Jordan and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal, The 
Associated Press has learned. Senators, still uncertain of how to 
proceed, prepared to debate the thorny issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors made the decision today at a meeting just before  
the Senate trial reconvened, according to two House sources, who 
spoke only on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors, expecting to be limited by the Senate to only  
two or three witnesses, decided to leave Oval Office secretary 
Betty Currie off the list because they felt her testimony was not 
clear enough on the retrieval of subpoenaed gifts the president had 
given Ms. Lewinsky, one source said. 
</P>
<P>
	With the debate over witnesses set to begin, one Republican  
senator questioned the quality of the prosecution's overall case. 
``If it were an airtight case ... you'd probably have about 70, 75 
senators lining up to convict,'' said Sen. Richard Shelby of 
Alabama. ``You don't see that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shelby said on NBC's ``Today'' that he is willing to listen to  
House prosecutors' arguments for witnesses even though they ``are 
hoping to find something rather than perhaps having something.'' 
But unless it can be shown that witnesses will change the dynamic 
of the trial, ``I say let's dispense with the witnesses and go on 
and vote the issue up or down after we have arguments,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said his prosecution team was trying to  
pare down the witness list to the ``bare essentials.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It isn't what we would like. ... But we have to be realistic.  
It's not our call, it's their call,'' Hyde said of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde said his prosecution team still wanted to have the  
witnesses testify from the well of the Senate but might have to 
settle for videotaped depositions. ``It's second best. We'd rather 
have the live witnesses there, subject to cross examination,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another of the prosecutors, Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., suggested  
Ms. Lewinsky ``could offer a limited amount of new information'' if 
called as a witness. 
</P>
<P>
	The former intern, who returned from California to Washington  
over the weekend to talk with the House managers after being 
compelled by a federal judge, decided to leave town today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her state of mind is she wants to get out of town and I  
endorse that,'' attorney Plato Cacheris said outside the hotel 
where she was staying. ``She and I hope she will not have to 
testify. If she's needed, they issue a proper document to get her 
back here, she will return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky was the central player in the case brought by House  
prosecutors. One of the House source said the prosecutors would use 
her to testify that it was Mrs. Currie who initiated the gift 
retrieval, believing that Ms. Lewinsky's testimony has been clearer 
on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, a longtime Clinton confidant and golfing partner, helped  
find Ms. Lewinsky a job around the time she had emerged as a 
subpoenaed figure in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case against 
Clinton. Jordan denies the job search and the lawsuit were 
connected. 
</P>
<P>
	And Blumenthal was one of the aides to whom Clinton first denied  
having a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky after the 
controversy erupted. He was later called as a grand jury witness 
and repeated Clinton's denial there, including that the president 
believed the former intern had stalked him. House prosecutors hope 
to show Clinton lied to his aides so they would pass on the false 
information to the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Larry Craig of Idaho, a member of the GOP leadership, said  
if senators gave permission to the prosecutors to take depositions, 
they probably would be required to report back by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be time limits, absolutely,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders are considering another option to outright  
acquittal or conviction and removal from office: find that Clinton 
committed perjury and obstruction of justice in connection with his 
affair with Ms. Lewinsky but not remove him. 
</P>
<P>
	That option by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, Republican officials  
said, is predicated on the widely held assumption that the 67 votes 
needed to convict and remove Clinton would never materialize. This 
way, Clinton would emerge from the trial formally acquitted of the 
impeachment charges but irrevocably tarnished -- and senators would 
be afforded some cover with constituents who believe action should 
be taken. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an idea that is not meeting a great deal of opposition in  
the Republican caucus,'' Lott spokesman John Czwartacki told 
reporters Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., said today, ``It raises questions in  
my mind, constitutional questions and procedural questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Craig said, ``My first reaction is that it is  
worth pursuing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats questioned whether the proposal was constitutional.  
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was expected to vote both on the witness question and  
a Democratic motion to dismiss the charge by Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Before senators went into a rare closed session Monday to debate  
Sen. Robert Byrd's dismissal motion, the White House argued that 
the case was over. 
</P>
<P>
	``The case cannot be made. It is time to end it,'' said attorney  
Nicole Seligman, one of Clinton's defense team. 
</P>
<P>
	But several GOP senators were sticking to their belief that the  
president should be removed. They insisted that witnesses be called 
to substantiate charges of perjury and obstruction of justice in 
his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.

<HEADLINE> $4B Sought To Combat Global Warming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, stymied in getting  
quick acceptance of the Kyoto climate treaty, will seek $4 billion 
next year to pursue an ``aggressive, commonsense'' policy that 
addresses the threat of global warming. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials disclosed late Monday that President  
Clinton intends to propose as part of his next budget sharp 
increases in climate-change related spending and tax breaks in 
hopes of reducing the flow of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore said the additional spending, which is  
expected to meet stiff resistance in Congress, represents 
``significant new investments ... to accelerate our aggressive, 
commonsense efforts to meet the challenge of global warming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals will be part of the fiscal 2000 budget the  
president will send to Congress next month. 
</P>
<P>
	A linchpin of the climate initiative will be a plan to create a  
$200 million ``clean air partnership fund'' that would be used to 
generate millions of dollars more in state and private funds to 
help reduce greenhouse gases, chiefly carbon dioxide from burning 
fossil fuels. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior White House official said the money, which in many  
cases will be tied to promises of state matching funds, can be used 
for a wide variety of programs from retrofitting buildings to 
purchasing more fuel-efficient or cleaner burning vehicles. Some of 
the funds would be used to promote public-private partnerships to 
reduce greenhouse gases, including voluntary efforts by companies 
to improve energy efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration will argue to Congress that the funds will be  
earmarked for programs that not only address climate change, but 
also reduce urban smog and other air pollution by reducing 
emissions from automobiles or coal-burning power plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The initiative will help states and communities meet tougher  
smog requirements and other clean air rules being developed by the 
Environmental Protection Agency, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Efforts to address global warming can at the same time help to  
protect public health,'' said Gore of the new spending programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton alluded to the clean air fund in his State of the Union  
address last week, but provided no details. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also is proposing $105 million, more than  
double the current levels, for research into how agriculture and 
forests can offset greenhouse gas emissions by absorbing carbon 
dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the climate package -- including proposals for more than  
$1.4 billion in tax incentives -- are aimed at promoting energy 
efficiency and spurring developing of new energy technologies to 
reduce the reliance on fossil fuels. 
</P>
<P>
	These include:  
</P>
<P>
	--$1.4 billion in spending for research and development into more  
energy-efficient technologies and renewable energy programs such as 
solar and wind power, a 34 percent increase over such spending this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	--Tax credits for purchase of ultra-energy-efficient homes or  
energy-efficient equipment, or for the purchase of electric, hybrid 
or fuel cell vehicles expected to begin hitting showrooms over the 
next few years. 
</P>
<P>
	--$122 million to spur technology for cleaner burning, coal-fired  
power plants. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar package of research dollars and tax incentives was  
proposed last year, but stalled in Congress amid charges from 
Republican critics that the administration was trying to implement 
the Kyoto accord without it first being sent to Congress for 
ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional opposition, especially among Republicans leery of  
the Kyoto climate agreement, is likely to be strong again this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Sen. Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign  
Affairs Committee, demanded that the White House send the Kyoto 
climate treaty up for ratification, sure that such an attempt would 
fail. Administration officials have said they don't expect the 
treaty to be submitted to Congress until after the 2000 election.

<HEADLINE> Funds Provide Ways To Play 'Net </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Internet frenzy on Wall Street is giving  
mutual fund investors all sorts of bad dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	In one nightmare, they discover a fund in which they have risked  
their hard-earned savings owns a whole slew of those speculative, 
wildly overpriced Internet stocks! 
</P>
<P>
	In another, they realize a fund on which they have staked their  
high hopes for the future doesn't own any of those soaring, wildly 
successful Internet stocks! 
</P>
<P>
	No question about it, 'Netmania presents all stock investors  
with some tough and scary choices. But fund shareowners may have 
reason to be pleased, as well as perplexed, by the whole situation. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, funds provide a handy way for small investors to  
share in the benefits of the great technology boom without going 
overboard. Quite possibly, the whole gaudy balloon will burst at 
some point, but fund investors can cushion themselves against that 
hazard by keeping their overall portfolios well diversified. 
</P>
<P>
	Some aggressive-minded types seem to be thinking of little else  
but the Internet right now. They are avid buyers of the four or 
five specialized Internet funds that have popped up lately, or of 
technology or Nasdaq market funds that own large amounts of 'Net 
stocks. These investors are playing the game hard, taking major 
risks. 
</P>
<P>
	But Internet investing needn't be an all-or-nothing proposition.  
More conservative investors can get a blend of Internet- and 
technology-related stocks together with other kinds of companies in 
a broadly diversified growth or aggressive growth fund. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, you can become part of the Internet action in some  
unexpected ways. If you own shares of a Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock 
composite index fund, for instance, you just upped the ante on your 
Internet investment: You acquired a juicy stake in America Online 
Inc., when AOL's stock was added to the index a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	At the biggest of all managed stock funds, Fidelity Magellan,  
AOL also is making its presence felt. It showed up as the 
third-largest of the fund's stock holdings at the end of 1998. 
Three months earlier, it hadn't even been in Magellan's Top 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Fidelity Investments' monthly Mutual Fund Guide reported that  
the percentage of Magellan's portfolio committed to technology 
stocks doubled last year, from 12.9 percent at the start of the 
year to 25.8 percent as of Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	This increased weighting seemed to provide Magellan with an  
important boost as it coasted to a 33.63 percent return for the 
year, outpacing the S&AMP;P 500 by more than five percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, some observers are cautioning that Bob Stansky, Magellan's  
manager, achieved that result by taking some extra risk, as 
exemplified by the increased technology stake. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's a good bet critics would be grumbling even louder if  
Stansky hadn't increased Magellan's technology weighting. For the 
past year, technology has been where most of the money has been 
made in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	And as long as they are paying Fidelity's management fees,  
Magellan investors presumably want Stansky to keep pulling out the 
stops to beat the S&AMP;P 500. Otherwise, why wouldn't they be just as 
happy owning a lower-cost index fund? 
</P>
<P>
	They wouldn't even have to jump ship to rival Vanguard, which  
runs the biggest and most famous S&AMP;P 500 fund. Right there in 
Fidelity's own shop there's the $7.15 billion Spartan Market Index 
Fund, which the firm rarely publicizes but which is enjoying so 
much popularity it more than quadrupled in size over the past two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	However you approach it, Internet investing is anything but a  
static endeavor. Lately, the field has broadened to include any 
company engaged in Internet commerce, or maybe just thought to have 
plans in that direction. So yesterday's retailing stock, or 
financial services stock, may easily become today's or tomorrow's 
Internet stock. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not easy to keep on top of this fast-moving,  
ever-undulating wave. But then, this whole job is precisely the 
kind of reason why people hire professional fund managers in the 
first place.

<HEADLINE> Hornets Sign Chuck Person </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Chuck Person, waived by the Chicago Bulls  
after they acquired him in a trade just four days earlier, signed 
Tuesday with the Charlotte Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
	Person, a 12-year veteran and a first-round draft pick from  
Auburn in 1986, has a career average of 15.7 points, and is a 
career 37-percent shooter from 3-point range. He spent the last 
four seasons with San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chuck is a true professional with experience that this team  
can use,'' said vice president Bob Bass. ``He is a proven scorer 
and a threat from 3-point range.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team did not specify the length or amount of the contract.  
Person said earlier in the day he would sign a one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Person will help fill the gap left by Glen Rice's elbow injury.  
Rice, the Hornets' starting small forward, had surgery on his right 
elbow last week and could miss the next six to eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice averaged 22.3 points last season. The Hornets' other  
alternatives at small forward are journeymen Chucky Brown and 
Travis Williams.

	EVERETT, Mass. (AP) -- Five children found shivering in a home  
littered with beer cans, animal feces, rotting food and cockroaches 
were placed in state custody.

	The two girls and three boys, who range in age from 22 months to  
13 years, were placed with relatives and in foster homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Their parents are facing unrelated charges in court. The home  
has been declared unfit for human habitation.

<HEADLINE> Suzuki Minicar Tops Toyota Corolla </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Suzuki Wagon R minicar was the top seller in  
Japan last year, displacing the Toyota Corolla for the first time 
in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	With the overall domestic auto market slumping, Corolla sales  
fell 17 percent to 196,498 vehicles last year from 1997, Toyota 
Motor Corp. spokesman Tomomi Imai said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of the Wagon R, totaling 206,548 last year, remained  
robust because of the debut of a new model in October to coincide 
with new safety standards that went into effect that month, said 
Suzuki Motor Corp. spokesman Michiya Horikoshi. 
</P>
<P>
	The Corolla had been Japan's best-selling car since 1969 and is  
still the top seller among regular-sized cars here. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wagon R, Japan's best-selling minicar since 1996, is not  
sold in the United States.

<HEADLINE>  Russians Lead Ice Dance Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- World champions Angelika Krylova  
and Oleg Ovsiannikov of Russia took the lead after the ice dance 
compulsaries today at at the European Figure Skating Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Krylova and Ovsiannikov took all first-place votes from the  
judges, scoring mostly in the 5.7-5.8 range, after a routine skated 
to the Ravensburger Waltz and Tagno Romantica. 
</P>
<P>
	Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat of France were second,  
although the U.S. judge rated another Russian couple, Irina 
Lobacheva and Ilia Averbach, second. Anissina once skated with 
Averbach for the former Soviet Union and won two junior world 
championships with him before moving to France. 
</P>
<P>
	The original dance to the waltz rhythm follows Thursday and the  
free dance is scheduled for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Russians also led the pairs and men's competitions. Yevgeny  
Plushenko was favored in the men's event competition, with a 
commanding performance at the men's qualifications Monday. 
Plushenko, barely 16, was in a class by himself while Olympic, 
world and European champions fell. 
</P>
<P>
	He entered today's short program with an advantage over 1994  
Olympic gold medalist Alexei Urmanov and defending European and 
current world champion Alexei Yagudin, his Russian teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men' event, Plushenko completed a quadruple toe loop, two  
triple-triple combinations and four other triples. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, the qualifying rounds count for 20 percent  
of the total score. The top 15 men from each of the two groups 
advanced to today's short program, which counts for another 30 
percent. The men's final free program is Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Urmanov, fell heavily on his opening jump and had a poor first  
two minutes. He recovered somewhat to end with three triples in the 
final minute to come in second to Plushenko in his group. 
</P>
<P>
	Urmanov, skating his first European since a 1997 injury, hit the  
boards on an off-center triple toe loop opening the program. 
Yagudin fared even worse, finishing behind Frenchman Laurent Tobel 
and Andreas Vlascenko of Germany in the first group. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagudin was clearly stunned by his mediocre presentation,  
falling on his first triple jump, cutting down two others to 
doubles and barely holding landings on three more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was not ready to skate like that,'' Yagudin said. ``The  
warmups were good. The practices were good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably I was in shock when I fell,'' the 18-year-old Russian  
said of his first triple axel, which he landed momentarily before 
collapsing. ``The jump was pretty good.''

<HEADLINE> Pope's Speech at St. Louis Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The prepared text of Pope John Paul II's speech  
at a youth rally Tuesday at the Kiel Center, as provided by the 
Archdiocese of St. Louis: 

</P>
<P>
	Dear young people of St. Louis:  
</P>
<P>
	Praised be Jesus Christ.  
</P>
<P>
	Your warm and enthusiastic welcome makes me very happy. It tells  
me that tonight the pope belongs to you. I have just been in Mexico 
City to celebrate the conclusion of the Synod of Bishops for 
America. There I had the joy of being with many thousands of young 
people. And now, my joy continues here with you, the young people 
of St. Louis and Missouri, and of the whole United States. 
</P>
<P>
	We are gathered here this evening to listen to Jesus as he  
speaks to us through his word and in the power of the Holy Spirit. 
</P>
<P>
	We have just heard the Apostle Paul say to Timothy, his young  
fellow evangelizer: ``Train yourself for devotion.'' These are 
important words for every Christian, for everyone who truly seeks 
to follow the Lord and to put his words into practice. They are 
especially important for you, the young people of the Church. And 
so you need to ask yourselves: What training am I doing in order to 
live a truly Christian life? 
</P>
<P>
	You all know what ``training'' is, and what it signifies. In  
fact, we are here in the Kiel Center where many people train long 
and hard in order to compete in different sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, this impressive stadium has become another kind of  
training ground -- not for hockey or soccer or basketball, but for 
that training that will help you to live your faith in Jesus more 
decisively. This is the ``training in devotion'' that Saint Paul is 
referring to -- the training that makes it possible for you to give 
yourselves without reservation to the Lord and to the work that he 
calls you to do. 
</P>
<P>
	I am told that there was much excitement in St. Louis during the  
recent baseball season, when two great players, Mark McGwire and 
Sammy Sosa, were competing to break the home run record. You can 
feel the same great enthusiasm as you train for a different goal: 
the goal of following Christ, the goal of bringing his message to 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Each one of you belongs to Christ, and Christ belongs to you. At  
Baptism you were claimed for Christ with the sign of the cross; you 
received the Catholic faith as a treasure to be shared with others. 
In confirmation, you were sealed with the gifts of the Holy Spirit 
and strengthened for your Christian mission and vocation. In the 
Eucharist, you receive the food that nourishes you for the 
spiritual challenges of each day. 
</P>
<P>
	I am especially pleased that so many of you had the opportunity  
today to receive the Sacrament of Penance, the Sacrament of 
Reconciliation. In this sacrament you experience the saviors tender 
mercy and love in a most personal way, when you are freed from sin 
and from its ugly companion which is shame. Your burdens are lifted 
and you experience the joy of new life in Christ. 
</P>
<P>
	Your belonging to the church can find no greater expression or  
support than by sharing in the Eucharist every Sunday in your 
parishes. Christ gives us the gift of his body and blood to make us 
one body, one spirit in him, to bring us more deeply into communion 
with him and with all the members of his body, the church. Make the 
Sunday celebration in your parishes a real encounter with Jesus in 
the community of his followers. This is an essential part of your 
``training in devotion'' to the Lord. 
</P>
<P>
	Dear young friends, in the reading we have just heard, the  
Apostle Paul tells Timothy: ``Let no one have contempt for your 
youth.'' He says this because youth is a marvelous gift of God. It 
is a time of special energies, special opportunities and special 
responsibilities. Christ and the church need your special talents. 
Use well the gifts the Lord has given you. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the time of your ``training,'' of your physical,  
intellectual, emotional and spiritual development. But this does 
not mean that you can put off until later your meeting with Christ 
and your sharing in the church's mission. Even though you are 
young, the time for action is now. Jesus does not have ``contempt 
for your youth.'' He does not set you aside for a later time when 
you will be older and your training will be complete. Your training 
will never be finished. Christians are always in training. You are 
ready for what Christ wants of you now. He wants you -- all of you -- 
to be light to the world, as only young people can be light. It is 
time to let your light shine. 
</P>
<P>
	In all my travels I tell the world about your youthful energies,  
your gifts and your readiness to love and serve. And wherever I go 
I challenge young people -- as a friend -- to live in the light and 
truth of Jesus Christ. 
</P>
<P>
	I urge you to let his word enter your hearts, and then from the  
bottom of your hearts to tell him: ``Here I am Lord, I come to do 
your will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	(Later in the rally, the pope spoke again.)  
</P>
<P>
	Dear young people:  
</P>
<P>
	Ask yourselves: Do I believe these words of Jesus in the Gospel?  
Jesus is calling you the light of the world. He is asking you to 
let your light shine before others. I know that in your hearts you 
want to say: ``Here I am, Lord. Here I am. I come to do your 
will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But only if you are one with Jesus can you share his light and  
be a light to the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Are you ready for this?  
</P>
<P>
	Sadly, too many people today are living apart from the light --  
in a world of illusions, a world of fleeting shadows and promises 
unfulfilled. If you look to Jesus, if you live the Truth that is 
Jesus, you will have in you the light that reveals the truths and 
values on which to build your own happiness, while building a world 
of justice, peace and solidarity. Remember what Jesus said: ``I am 
the light of the world; those who follow me will not walk in 
darkness, but will have the light of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because Jesus is the light, we too become light when we proclaim  
him. This is the heart of the Christian mission to which each of 
you has been called through Baptism and confirmation. You are 
called to make the light of Christ shine brightly in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	When you were little, were you sometimes afraid of the dark?  
Today you are no longer children afraid of the dark. You are 
teen-agers and young adults. But already you realize that there is 
another kind of darkness in the world: the darkness of doubt and 
uncertainty. You may feel the darkness of loneliness and isolation. 
Your anxieties may come from questions about your future, or 
regrets about past choices. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes the world itself seems filled with darkness. The  
darkness of children who go hungry and even die. The darkness of 
homeless people who lack work and proper medical care. The darkness 
of violence: violence against the unborn child, violence in 
families, the violence of gangs, the violence of sexual abuse, the 
violence of drugs that destroy the body, mind and heart. 
</P>
<P>
	There is something terribly wrong when so many young people are  
overcome by hopelessness to the point of taking their own lives. 
And already in parts of this nation, laws have been passed which 
allow doctors to end the lives of the very people they are sworn to 
help. God's gift of life is being rejected. Death is chosen over 
life, and this brings with it the darkness of despair. 
</P>
<P>
	But you believe in the light. Do not listen to those who  
encourage you to lie, to shirk responsibility, to put yourselves 
first. Do not listen to those who tell you that chastity is passe. 
In your hearts you know that true love is a gift from God and 
respects his plan for the union of man and woman in marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Do not be taken in by false values and deceptive slogans,  
especially about your freedom. True freedom is a wonderful gift 
from God, and it has been a cherished part of your country's 
history. But when freedom is separated from truth, individuals lose 
their moral direction and the very fabric of society begins to 
unravel. 
</P>
<P>
	Freedom is not the ability to do anything we want, whenever we  
want. Rather, freedom is the ability to live responsibly the truth 
of our relationship with God and with one another. Remember what 
Jesus said: ``You will know the truth and the truth will set you 
free.'' Let no one mislead you or prevent you from seeing what 
really matters. Turn to Jesus, listen to him, and discover the true 
meaning and direction of your lives. 
</P>
<P>
	You are children of the light. You belong to Christ, and he has  
called you by name. Your first responsibility is to get to know as 
much as you can about him, in your parishes, in religious 
instruction in your high schools and colleges, in your youth groups 
and Newman Centers. 
</P>
<P>
	But you will get to know him truly and personally only through  
prayer. What is needed is that you talk to him, and listen to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Today we are living in an age of instant communications. But do  
you realize what a unique form of communication prayer is? Prayer 
enables us to meet God at the most profound level of our being. It 
connects us directly to God: Father, Son and Holy Spirit, in a 
constant exchange of love. 
</P>
<P>
	Through prayer you will learn to become the light of the world,  
because in prayer you become one with the source of our true light, 
Jesus himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of you has a special mission in life, and you are each  
called to be a disciple of Christ. Many of you will serve God in 
the vocation of Christian married life; some of you will serve him 
as dedicated single persons; some as priests and religious. But all 
of you must be the light of the world. To those of you who think 
that Christ may be inviting you to follow him in the priesthood or 
the consecrated life I make this personal appeal: I ask you to open 
your hearts generously to him; do not delay your response. The Lord 
will help you to know his will; he will help you to follow your 
vocation courageously. 
</P>
<P>
	Young friends, in the days and weeks and years ahead, for as  
long as you remember this evening, remember that the pope came to 
the United States, to the city of St. Louis, to call the young 
people of America to Christ, to invite you to follow him. He came 
to challenge you to be the light of the world. ``The light shines 
in the darkness and the darkness does not overcome it.'' Jesus who 
has conquered sin and death reminds you: ``I am with you always.'' 
He says: ``Courage! It is I; have no fear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the horizon of this city stands the Gateway Arch, which often  
catches the sunlight in its different colors and hues. In a similar 
way, in a thousand different ways, you must reflect the light of 
Christ through your lives of prayer and joyful service of others. 
With the help of Mary, the mother of Jesus, the young people of 
America will do this magnificently. 
</P>
<P>
	Remember: Christ is calling you; the Church needs you; the pope  
believes in you and he expects great things of you. 
</P>
<P>
	Praised be Jesus Christ.

<HEADLINE> Ore. Mom Sentenced in Death of Son </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELLESONTAINE, Ohio (AP) -- A woman who said she didn't hear her  
toddler scream while lodged in a heating duct was sentenced to a 
year and a half in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	DeAnna McGee, 25, was sentenced Monday after pleading guilty  
last week to child endangering in the death of her 20-month-old 
son, Chad. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 24, 1994, while his mother was sleeping, Chad removed a  
floor grating, crawled into a foot-wide duct and became stuck. He 
died of dehydration from burns. 
</P>
<P>
	Appeals courts overturned two previous child endangering  
convictions, but Ms. McGee decided last week to avoid another trial 
and agreed to the plea. 
</P>
<P>
	During a 1994 trial, prosecutor Gerald Heaton said a neighbor  
heard the boy's yells. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Marc Triplett said he will ask for his client's  
early release after she serves 30 days on grounds that the loss of 
her son has caused her enough suffering.

<HEADLINE> Militia Member Found Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) -- A militia member was convicted Tuesday  
of plotting to blow up federal properties and threatening to attack 
and murder government officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Graham also was found guilty of growing marijuana to  
finance the conspiracy. The federal jury acquitted Graham on 
charges of possessing illegal machine guns seized from another 
militia member's home. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham, 42, faces up to 30 years in prison when he is sentenced  
May 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Lloyd Meyer called the verdict  
``tremendous'' even though jurors rejected three counts of the 
nine-count indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	``An armed and dangerous man is no longer walking the streets,''  
Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Jeffrey O'Hara said no decision about an appeal  
would be made until after sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham is the second member of the North American Militia to be  
convicted in this case. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, a federal jury found Bradford Metcalf, 47, guilty  
on weapons and conspiracy charges. He will be sentenced in April. A 
third co-defendant, Kenneth Carter, 47, of Battle Creek, is 
cooperating with the government and will be sentenced in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges stem from a raid last year at Metcalf's home where  
authorities seized thousands of rounds of ammunition and loaded 
weapons.

<HEADLINE> AMA Editors Support Fired Editor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Editors of the Journal of the American Medical  
Association are criticizing an AMA executive who fired a top editor 
over an article about sexual attitudes that was timed to coincide 
with President Clinton's impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The editors, JAMA's editorial board members and editors of the  
AMA Archives journals released an editorial Tuesday criticizing AMA 
executive Vice President E. Ratcliffe Anderson Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	The editorial is to appear in the Feb. 3 issue of the journal.  
</P>
<P>
	``While we acknowledge Dr. Anderson's administrative authority  
to act as he did, we ... strongly disagree with the decision,'' the 
editorial reads. ``Editorial independence is the lifeblood of the 
Journal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson fired Dr. George Lundberg for publishing an article  
based on 1991 survey data by the Kinsey Institute for Research in 
Sex, Gender and Reproduction that found that most of the 599 
college students surveyed did not consider oral-genital contact as 
having ``had sex.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lundberg, who was fired Jan. 15 after 17 years as JAMA editor,  
has also won support from editors at other medical publications. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson released a statement promising to safeguard JAMA's  
``tradition of integrity, independence and responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Richard M. Glass, one of JAMA's interim co-editors, said  
Anderson's statement ``reinforces what he has told us about his 
commitment to editorial independence.''

<HEADLINE> Text of Pope's St. Louis Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The prepared text of Pope John Paul II's speech  
at Lambert Airport on Tuesday, as provided by the Archdiocese of 
St. Louis: 

</P>
<P>
	Mr. President, dear people of St. Louis, dear people of the  
United States: 
</P>
<P>
	It is a great joy for me to return to the United States and to  
experience once more your warm hospitality. 
</P>
<P>
	As you know, I have been in Mexico, to celebrate the conclusion  
of the Special Assembly for America of the Synod of Bishops. The 
purpose of that important meeting was to prepare the church to 
enter the new millennium and to encourage a new sense of solidarity 
among the peoples of the continent. Now I am happy to be able to 
bring this message to mid-America, on the banks of the Mississippi, 
in this historic city of St. Louis, the Gateway to the West. 
</P>
<P>
	I am grateful to you, Mr. President, for your courtesy in  
meeting me on my arrival. I likewise greet the governor and 
authorities of the state of Missouri, as well as the mayor of St. 
Louis and the other officials of the city and surrounding areas. So 
many people have offered their generous cooperation in preparation 
for this visit, and I am grateful to them all. 
</P>
<P>
	As pastor of the universal church, I am particularly happy to  
greet the Catholic community of the Archdiocese of St. Louis, with 
its rich spiritual heritage and its dynamic traditions of service 
to those in need. I wish to say a special word of appreciation to 
Archbishop Justin Rigali, who has been close to me since I became 
pope 20 years ago. I am looking forward to being with the priests, 
deacons, religious and laity of this local church, which has 
exercised such influence on the history of the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	With deep thanks I greet the cardinals and bishops. Their  
presence gives me an opportunity to send my good wishes to the 
whole province of St. Louis and its ecclesiastical region, and to 
all the dioceses of this country. Although St. Louis is the only 
place I am able to visit at this time, I feel close to all the 
Catholics of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	I express my friendship and esteem for my fellow Christians, for  
the Jewish community in America, for our Muslim brothers and 
sisters. I express my cordial respect for people of all religions 
and for every person of good will. 
</P>
<P>
	As history is retold, the name of St. Louis will be forever  
linked to the first trans-Atlantic flight, and to the immense human 
endeavor and daring behind the name ``The Spirit of St. Louis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	You are preparing for the bicentennial of the Louisiana Purchase  
made in 1804 by President Thomas Jefferson. That anniversary 
presents a challenge of religious and civic renewal to the entire 
community. It will be the opportunity to reassert ``The Spirit of 
St. Louis'' and to reaffirm the genuine truths and values of the 
American experience. 
</P>
<P>
	There are times of trial, tests of national character, in the  
history of every country. America has not been immune to them. One 
such time of trial is closely connected with St. Louis. Here, the 
famous Dred Scott case was heard. And in that case the Supreme 
Court of the United States subsequently declared an entire class of 
human beings -- people of African descent -- outside the boundaries 
of the national community and the Constitution's protection. 
</P>
<P>
	After untold suffering and with enormous effort, that situation  
has, at least in part, been reversed. 
</P>
<P>
	America faces a similar time of trial today. Today, the conflict  
is between a culture that affirms, cherishes and celebrates the 
gift of life, and a culture that seeks to declare entire groups of 
human beings -- the unborn, the terminally ill, the handicapped and 
others considered ``unuseful'' -- to be outside the boundaries of 
legal protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the seriousness of the issues involved, and because  
of America's great impact on the world as a whole, the resolution 
of this new time of testing will have profound consequences for the 
century whose threshold we are about to cross. My fervent prayer is 
that through the grace of God at work in the lives of Americans of 
every race, ethnic group, economic condition and creed, America 
will resist the culture of death and choose to stand steadfastly on 
the side of life. 
</P>
<P>
	To choose life -- as I wrote in this year's message for the World  
Day of Peace -- involves rejecting every form of violence: the 
violence of poverty and hunger, which oppresses so many human 
beings; the violence of armed conflict, which does not resolve but 
only increases divisions and tensions; the violence of particularly 
abhorrent weapons such as anti-personnel mines; the violence of 
drug trafficking; the violence of racism; and the violence of 
mindless damage to the natural environment. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a higher moral vision can motivate the choice for life. And  
the values underlying that vision will greatly depend on whether 
the nation continues to honor and revere the family as the basic 
unit of society: the family -- teacher of love, service, 
understanding and forgiveness; the family -- open and generous to 
the needs of others; the family -- the great wellspring of human 
happiness. 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. President, dear friends: I am pleased to have another  
opportunity to thank the American people for the countless works of 
human goodness and solidarity which, from the beginning, have been 
such a part of the history of your country. At the same time I know 
that you will hear my plea to open wide your hearts to the ever 
increasing plight and urgent needs of our less fortunate brothers 
and sisters throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
	This, too -- the spirit of compassion, concern and generous  
sharing -- must be part of ``The Spirit of St. Louis.'' Even more, 
it must be the renewed spirit of this ``one nation, under God, with 
liberty and justice for all.'' God bless you all. God bless 
America.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Seeks To Warm Colorado River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Federal officials are proposing a plan to warm a  
16-mile section of the Colorado River to give an endangered native 
Arizona fish a better chance at survival. 
</P>
<P>
	The humpback chub, named for a hump that helps it navigate river  
rapids, has been endangered since 1967, four years after Glen 
Canyon Dam was built in far northern Arizona, just south of the 
Utah state line. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials said the chub's population has been driven  
down by cold water releases from the dam which kill the fish. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation is proposing a $15 million  
modification to the dam that would draw warmer water from the top 
of Lake Powell, an artificial lake created by the dam. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists praised the plan but want assurances that the  
changes will be carefully monitored. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a good idea if they pay attention to the equipment and  
shut it down if is not working,'' Rob Smith, a Southwest 
representative for the Sierra Club, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Wirth, spokesman for the Reclamation Bureau in Salt Lake  
City, said the proposed modifications to Glen Canyon Dam are 
comparable to those implemented at the Flaming Gorge Dam in Utah in 
1978, since both dams are about the same age and are part of the 
Colorado River Project. 
</P>
<P>
	After modifying the Flaming Gorge Dam to raise the temperature  
in the Green River, the bureau documented increases in both the 
numbers of endangered and native fish, Wirth said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fish are very sensitive to changes in temperature and if we  
can narrow that range, we can increase their survival 
capabilities,'' Wirth said. 
</P>
<P>
	If approved, construction of the new intake structures at Glen  
Canyon could begin next year with completion by 2002, officials 
said.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors Want To See Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors pleaded with the Senate on  
Tuesday to issue subpoenas for ``a pitiful three'' impeachment 
trial witnesses -- Monica Lewinsky and two others -- and to request 
that President Clinton answer questions under oath. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Senate went behind closed doors to debate the witness  
issue, the White House said Clinton has no intention of submitting 
to questioning, even if confronted with a request for it. ``It's 
time to wrap this up,'' presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said of 
the trial, in its third week. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyers, joined by Senate Democrats, also warned that  
the issuance of subpoenas for depositions from Ms. Lewinsky, 
presidential friend Vernon Jordan and White House aide Sidney 
Blumenthal would raise the possibility of long delays in the 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	But senators in both parties, emerging from the three-hour  
closed-door session, said revived negotiations were under way on a 
bipartisan timetable for a final vote on the articles of 
impeachment by the middle of next month -- after witnesses are 
deposed on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	``The procedural aspects, after the votes go forward, the  
process by which witnesses would be deposed and so on'' are the 
focus of the talks, said Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	One Democratic official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,  
said it was possible the White House would be asked if it wanted 
any witnesses deposed, and they, too, would be added to the list 
under a compressed timetable that envisioned a final vote on 
Clinton's fate within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Democrat, Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, said it was  
possible the votes scheduled for Wednesday would be scrapped, 
although others said that was unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most senators in both parties do not want to make the same  
mistakes the House did'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., referring 
to the partisan impeachment brawl that developed there. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky, summoned to Washington over the weekend to be  
interviewed by the House prosecutors, checked out of her hotel and 
flew home to California. Her lawyer said she would return if 
ordered to answer further questions. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors said they had trimmed their list to pass Senate  
muster. ``A pitiful three, and I would think you would want to 
proceed with that minimum testimony,'' said Rep. Henry Hyde, the 
lead prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic leader Tom Daschle conceded that the Republicans,  
with a 55-45 majority, were likely to prevail when the roll is 
called on Wednesday, forcing approval of subpoenas for Ms. 
Lewinsky, Jordan and Blumenthal. ``I think it's going to be 
virtually a party-line vote, unfortunately,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for questioning Clinton, he added, ``That's a red herring. It  
is not going anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All witnesses would be questioned under oath at private  
depositions about the facts concerning allegations of perjury and 
obstruction of justice by the president in connection with his 
efforts to conceal a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
Guidelines for the questioning remain to be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's closed-door Senate session was the second in as many  
nights. As was the case on Monday, a request by Democratic Sens. 
Tom Harkin of Iowa and Paul Wellstone of Minnesota to open the 
doors was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	The winnowed list of three witnesses marked a concession by the  
House prosecutors, who were fearful that a more extensive request 
would cost them the support of wavering Republicans and seal the 
defeat of their effort for testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're down from thinking we ought to have 10, 12, maybe 15  
witnesses, to three,'' Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida said during a 
four-hour legal argument on the Senate floor during the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Hyde: ``We have a good case, we have an excellent case  
without the witnesses, but the witnesses help you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's lawyers and Democratic allies reacted with a  
mixture of scorn and warnings, knowing that public opinion polls 
favor a swift end to the trial and that Clinton's acquittal on 
charges of perjury and obstruction of justice is virtually assured. 
</P>
<P>
	``The time to end the trial is now, and the correct number of  
witnesses is zero,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts told 
reporters in an interview off the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	From the lectern stationed in the well of the chamber, lead  
Clinton attorney David Kendall said the House had yet to prove its 
case. He likened the prosecutors to a blackjack player betting 
against long odds. ``Here, they're simply gambling. ... I think it 
has no place in the impeachment trial here when the fate of the 
president is at stake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The day's events set the stage for a pair of showdown votes on  
Wednesday, first on a proposal by Democratic Sen. Robert C. Byrd of 
West Virginia to dismiss all charges and bring the trial to an end, 
then on the call for depositions. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd's proposal is widely expected to fail, by a party-line vote  
or more. Democratic officials have expressed concern that they may 
suffer defections from two or three members of their caucus, 
including Sens. Russell Feingold of Wisconsin, Bob Graham of 
Florida and possibly John Edwards of North Carolina, in office less 
than a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The second vote would take place on the call for subpoenas only,  
meaning that the Senate will not vote, for the time being at least, 
on whether to request that Clinton submit to a deposition. Majority 
Leader Trent Lott has labored behind the scenes to make sure GOP 
defections don't doom the proposal for subpoenas. 
</P>
<P>
	If the proposal is approved, the Senate still would have to  
resolve numerous details about the subpoenas, as well as grapple 
with White House demands for an extensive time to review records 
not previously made available to the president's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	With Republicans professing eagerness to wrap up the trial  
quickly, Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., circulated proposed ground rules 
at a closed-door GOP caucus. They would call for each witness to be 
deposed for a maximum of four hours, two hours for the House and 
two hours for the president's lawyers. Witnesses could be 
questioned only about areas of factual dispute. The sessions would 
be videotaped for senators to view. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., said on CNN's ``Larry King Live'' show  
that he, McCollum and Republican Reps. James Rogan of California 
and Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas would most likely depose the 
witnesses on behalf of the House managers. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the depositions, the Senate would decide whether to  
approve live testimony in the well of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's spokesman, John Czwartacki, said the Mississippi  
Republican hopes the depositions can be wrapped up by early next 
week. GOP officials also said Lott had mentioned a possibility 
during a closed-door caucus of having the Senate vote on a 
non-binding resolution declaring that Clinton had committed perjury 
and obstruction of justice, even though he would hold onto his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, Daschle said Democrats would insist that  
Clinton be treated fairly if witnesses were deposed. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to being entitled to depose the witnesses, Daschle  
said the White House should have access to 54,000 pages in the 
record it has yet to see, as well as voluminous documents assembled 
by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. In addition, he said, the 
``White House itself may want to call witnesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors want to question Jordan, an attorney and longtime  
Clinton friend, about his efforts to find Ms. Lewinsky a job at the 
same time she had been subpoenaed in the Paula Jones sexual 
harassment case against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal, who is close to first lady Hillary Clinton, is one  
of the White House aides to whom the president falsely denied 
having had a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. The article of 
impeachment alleging obstruction of justice says Clinton lied to 
his aides so they would pass on the false information to the grand 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, House prosecutors also asked permission to  
introduce three pieces of evidence that weren't in the official 
House impeachment record used so far during the trial.

<HEADLINE> Working Less Can Be Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- Charlotte Hawthorne advanced her  
high-powered career with Eli Lilly and Co. by working fewer hours 
and spending more time with her family. 
</P>
<P>
	Sound like a pipe dream? Researchers at Indiana's Purdue  
University and Montreal's McGill University say that in many large 
North American corporations, that dream has become reality. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, some corporations predict that customized work  
arrangements -- which help employees balance careers and family life 
-- will be the key to managing the modern work force. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was able to keep my career on track,'' said Hawthorne, who  
reduced her schedule with the drug company in 1993 when she had her 
first child. ``It was a more relaxed environment and I wasn't 
feeling guilty about not spending enough time with my children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hawthorne had a second child, continued her work as an  
industrial engineer and won a promotion to a managerial position 
before returning to full-time work in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Her success is not uncommon.  
</P>
<P>
	The universities performed a two-year study of 87 corporate  
professionals and managers who by choice work less than full time 
and have their wages reduced proportionately. The results showed 
that the scaled-back work weeks slowed employees' careers down, but 
didn't stop them. About 35 percent had actually been promoted since 
they started working less. 
</P>
<P>
	The adjusted schedules made about 90 percent of the respondents  
happier with the way they balanced work and home life, and only 10 
percent of the people interviewed planned to return to full-time 
work within the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelley MacDermid, director of the Purdue Center for Families  
and an associate professor of child development and family studies, 
said some of the respondents were women starting families, while 
others were men seeking more time with their kids or greater 
community involvement. The average age was about 39. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a substantial number of cases where both the boss and  
the worker thought that performance had improved,'' MacDermid said. 
``Certainly performance per unit time, but sometimes even overall 
performance was better. They were actually getting as much or more 
done working fewer hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The evolution of customized work arrangements is consistent with  
the changing makeup of the work force, according to Mary Dean Lee, 
associate professor of organizational behavior and human resource 
management at McGill University and director of the joint project. 
</P>
<P>
	``My view is that the way jobs got set up, the way careers got  
structured decades ago, was based on the old sort of society where 
men were the ones who had the professional and managerial jobs and 
they had wives who took care of the family work,'' Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though the traditional family structure has more or less  
disappeared, there really hasn't been any re-examination of how we 
think about professional work and careers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not every company offers flexibility for part-time workers. In  
addition, employees on nontraditional schedules still bump up 
against systems where success is judged by the number of hours 
workers on are in the office, according to a November 1997 study by 
the New York-based Catalyst research group. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there are indications that companies are beginning to  
change. 
</P>
<P>
	Candi Lange, director of work force partnering initiatives for  
the Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly, said 200 of her company's 14,000 
U.S. employees have schedules adjusted to fit their needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the manager to say, 'Do this and everything else has to  
take second place,' is no longer realistic given the needs of the 
current work force,'' Lange said. ``I think to be able to meet 
these real needs of the workplace, companies will have to become 
flexible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hawthorne believes Eli Lilly's flexibility helped her improve  
time management skills. ``I think I was probably most efficient 
when I was working three days a week,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Thomas, director of employment policies and programs for  
the Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp., said flexibility is key for 
competitive companies to retain quality workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's absolutely terrific because it enables us to  
retain people who we otherwise might lose,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	MacDermid said the study did have some negative results. Some  
people found it hard to set boundaries between home life and work, 
and started using their extra free time to keep working. 
</P>
<P>
	But both researchers agree that the positive results of their  
study foreshadow the future of successful labor management. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any sort of work arrangement that makes it possible for people  
to afford to put bread on the table and to spend time with their 
family members, I would think is a good thing,'' MacDermid said.

<HEADLINE> Arizona Court Upholds Tax Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The state Supreme Court Tuesday upheld a 1997  
state law to give income-tax breaks to individuals who donated 
money for scholarships at religious and other private schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, in a 3-2 decision, rejected arguments that the tax  
credit of up to $500 violated state constitutional prohibitions 
against tax dollars being used to support religious education. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no indication that the authors of the Arizona  
Constitution ``intended to divorce completely any hint of religion 
from all conceivably state-related functions, nor would such a goal 
be realistically attainable in today's world,'' Chief Justice 
Thomas A. Zlaket wrote for the majority. 
</P>
<P>
	The law was promoted by legislators and others who had been  
thwarted in previous efforts to win approval for school vouchers, 
which are cash grants to parents for tuition at private or public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the closest thing you can get to a full-blown vouchers  
program,'' said state Senate Education Committee Chairman John 
Huppenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	Zlaket wrote that there was no evidence the credit violated the  
U.S. Constitution's prohibition on government involvement in 
religion or the Arizona Constitution's ban on public money being 
used for churches or private schools. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the two dissenters, Justice Stanley G. Feldman, wrote  
that the tax credits were actually ``uncontrolled, 
government-reimbursed grants to private, primarily religious 
institutions'' and that the court's decision destroyed ``any 
pretense of separation of church and state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge was brought by a teachers union and other public  
school supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	On Nov. 9, the U.S. Supreme Court 9 refused to hear a legal  
challenge to Wisconsin's 8-year-old school voucher program.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Appoints Conservative Judge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a judicial balancing act, President Clinton  
on Tuesday nominated Barbara Durham, a conservative and chief 
justice of the Washington state Supreme Court, for a seat on the 
9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	Her nomination was promised in return for the Senate's  
long-delayed confirmation last year of William Fletcher to the same 
San Francisco-based appeals court. Fletcher, a Rhodes Scholar 
classmate of Clinton's, had been criticized as too liberal by some 
Republicans and his nomination languished for more than three years 
before it was confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Durham, of Seattle, has served on the state Supreme Court since  
1985 and has been chief justice since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Durham's nomination was one of five new judicial nominations and  
12 others that were not brought to a vote during the 105th 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Other new nominations for U.S. District Court seats are: Stefan  
R. Underhill of Fairfield, Conn., for the District of Connecticut; 
Gary A. Fees of South Pasadena, Calif., a judge on the Los Angeles 
Superior Court, for the Central District of California; T. John 
Ward of Longview, Texas, for the Eastern District of Texas; Keith 
P. Ellison of Houston, for the Southern District of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Being renominated are: Helene White of Detroit for the Court of  
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit; Ronald Gould of Mercer Island, 
Wash., Barry P. Goode of Richmond, Calif., Marsha Berzon of 
Berkeley, Calif., and Richard Paez of Los Angeles, all for the 
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Timothy Dyk of Washington, D.C., for the Federal Circuit;  
Matthew F. Kennelly of Evanston, Ill., for the Northern District of 
Illinois; William J. Hibbler of Richton Park, Ill., for the 
Northern District of Illinois; Virginia A. Phillips of Riverside, 
Calif., for the Central District of California; Lynette Norton of 
Stahlstown, Penn., for the Western District of Pennsylvania; 
Legrome D. Davis of Philadelphia for the Eastern District of 
Pennsylvania; and Ronnie White of St. Louis for the Eastern 
District of Missouri.

<HEADLINE> FDA Urges Caution With Clot-Buster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration urged doctors  
to consider prescribing alternative drugs to Abbott Laboratories' 
clot-buster Abbokinase, saying it poses a potential risk of 
spreading infectious disease. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to doctors Monday, the FDA warned that Abbokinase,  
known chemically as urokinase, should ``be reserved only for those 
situations where a physician has considered the alternatives and 
has determined that the use of Abbokinase is critical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abbokinase is one of many drugs used to dissolve blood clots. It  
is made from kidney cells taken from newborns who have died. 
</P>
<P>
	FDA inspectors halted shipments of Abbokinase in November after  
uncovering ``significant deviations'' from manufacturing rules that 
ensure drugs' purity and safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA said the kidney cells were taken from foreign newborns  
who were at high risk of carrying infectious diseases, including 
hepatitis C, yet Abbott didn't adequately test for infection. Also, 
the FDA said the cells were handled in a way that could have 
allowed contamination. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA has no evidence that Abbokinase actually was  
contaminated and is letting shipments resume with Abbott's 
agreement to tighten manufacturing safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the agency used the incident to warn doctors to weigh the  
potential risk of infection inherent to Abbokinase because it is 
made from human cells. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just saying, consider the alternatives,'' said FDA's Dr.  
David Feigal. ``It is a reminder that some of the other products 
are not human-sourced, so they do have different risks.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The rebound on Wall Street during January helped  
restore consumers' confidence in the economy, but Americans are 
still concerned about the outlook for their own finances in the 
months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey by the Conference Board released Tuesday found  
consumers are feeling better about the current financial situation 
than they did during December, particularly when it comes to the 
availability of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The business research group reported its index of consumer  
confidence rose 0.9 point to 127.6 from a revised 126.7 in 
December. The index dropped sharply in October and has since been 
making a steady recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest improvement comes in a month when the stock market  
has again reached new record highs. Some of the biggest gainers 
have been Internet issues that are sensitive to changes in the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers' sentiment is an important economic indicator since  
their spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's overall 
economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking ahead to the next six months, the Conference Board finds  
consumers aren't quite as secure. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of people who said they expect their incomes to  
increase over the next half-year dropped 5.3 percentage points, 
from 28.7 percent to 23.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, economists who analyzed the results say consumers are  
likely to be swayed by current headlines and that the index is 
therefore less valuable as a measure of how people feel about the 
economy going forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more a barometer of people's opinions rather than their  
actual behavior,'' said Diane Swonk, deputy chief economist with 
Chicago-based Bank One Corp. ``It's a poor indicator of spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're doing phenomenally well. What's key in the confidence  
numbers is that people feel about their own pocketbooks, and they 
feel really good,'' Swonk said. ``We're only a little off the 
all-time high'' of 138.2 that the Conference Board index set in 
June, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	While spending may slow a bit in the coming year, it will likely  
still be one of the strongest years of the past decade, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rise in consumer confidence was helped mostly by an increase  
in the number of consumers who said jobs currently are plentiful. 
Forty-five percent believe there are many jobs available, compared 
with 42.5 percent who said so a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``While consumer expectations have softened over the last  
several months, this vital sector of the economy continues to be 
optimistic,'' said Lynn Franco, associate director of the 
Conference Board. ``Consumers' appraisal of the current state of 
our economy is running at decade-high levels, signaling further 
growth in the months ahead.''

<HEADLINE> Brain Blood Flow, Alzheimer Linked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bits of a natural protein may promote  
Alzheimer's disease by disrupting the flow of blood in tiny vessels 
of the brain, according to a study in the February issue of the 
journal Nature Neuroscience. 
</P>
<P>
	The study provides more evidence that vitamin E and other  
antioxidants may fight the disease, and suggests that finding 
treatments to restore normal blood flow may also pay off. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists don't know what causes most Alzheimer's cases. Many  
point to overproduction of natural protein fragments called 
amyloid-beta, which form clumps in the brains of patients. Studies 
show these fragments can kill brain cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The new work by neurologist Dr. Constantino Iadecola of the  
University of Minnesota and others suggests amyloid-beta, or 
related fragments, can promote Alzheimer's in a second way: by 
boosting production of harmful substances called oxygen radicals, 
which in turn keep tiny blood vessels from delivering the right 
amounts of blood to brain cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Zaven Khachaturian, senior medical and scientific adviser to  
the Alzheimer's Association, called the work exciting and said it 
reveals ``a very important part of the story'' of what causes the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	In the brain, amyloid-beta fragments are clipped from long  
proteins called APP. The researchers studied a strain of mice that 
overproduce APP, which leads to an overproduction of amyloid-beta. 
Mice from this strain eventually develop mental problems resembling 
Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest study, the mice were studied long before any  
Alzheimer's-type symptoms appeared. Researchers found that 
microscopic blood vessels in the mice brains didn't respond to a 
chemical signal to dilate, which would increase blood flow. In 
normal life that might mean the vessels can't shunt more blood to 
brain cells when they need it, Iadecola said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually that could damage those starved cells, or at least  
make them more vulnerable to damage from other causes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But because the mice produce other fragments of APP in excess,  
the study can't formally show that amyloid-beta is the cause of the 
brain troubles in the mice, Iadecola said. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers found two bits of evidence that oxygen radicals  
were involved in the blood vessel problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers were able to prevent the abnormality by bathing the  
brain with an antioxidant, which render oxygen radicals harmless. 
In addition, mice that were programmed genetically to overproduce 
an antioxidant in addition to APP didn't show the abnormality in 
the first place. 
</P>
<P>
	Iadecola said a 1997 study of Alzheimer patients found that  
vitamin E, an antioxidant, modestly slowed the course of the 
disease.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Admits Iraq Missile Mistake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. military officials say they regret that a  
number of civilians were killed and injured in an American missile 
attack in southern Iraq, but they say the blame lies with President 
Saddam Hussein for threatening U.S. pilots patrolling Iraqi skies. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Anthony Zinni, commander of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf  
area, said Monday the American military will continue to hit Iraqi 
air defense radars, missiles and communications facilities in 
response to what he called increasingly hostile actions by Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Today the Pentagon reported two Iraqi violations of the  
``no-fly'' zone in northern Iraq and said a Marine Corps EA-6B 
Prowler, an electronic warfare plane, fired a high-speed 
anti-radiation missile after being targeted with radar at an Iraqi 
air defense site near the city of Mosul. Results of the Prowler 
attack, which occurred about 6 a.m. EST, were unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, F-15E strike aircraft fired guided bombs and an  
AGM-130 missile at anti-aircraft artillery emplacements and 
surface-to-air missile sites in southern Iraq, the Pentagon said. 
Other details were not immediately available, spokesman Col. 
Richard Bridges said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bridges said there were no reports of additional confrontations  
in southern Iraq today. 
</P>
<P>
	In Baghdad, Saddam urged Iraqis to be patient in the battle  
against the United States, saying in a speech carried by the 
official Iraqi News Agency: ``Your blood will not go in vain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zinni said Iraq tripled the number of surface-to-air missile, or  
SAM, batteries in the southern ``no-fly'' zone patrolled by U.S. 
and British warplanes in recent weeks. He said Iraqi fighter 
aircraft are trying to draw allied pilots into ``SAM-bushes'' in 
hopes of shooting one down. 
</P>
<P>
	Zinni said he could not yet confirm that the extensive damage  
and casualties to residential areas in and around the southern port 
city of Basra was caused by errant U.S. missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We deeply regret any civilian casualties regardless of what  
the cause may be,'' he said. ``But these exchanges have been 
initiated by Saddam Hussein.'' He said the United States wanted its 
Arab allies in the region to understand that U.S. missile attacks 
do not target civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one can guarantee that these strikes will not have errors  
or we might not have errant ordnance, but we do take every possible 
attempt to ensure that that doesn't happen,'' Zinni said. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-star Marine Corps general said it was premature to  
consider apologizing for the civilian losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Zinni said air crews that returned from Monday's mission over  
southern Iraq were interviewed as part of a painstaking effort to 
pinpoint what happened in the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the course of these debriefings review we have the  
possibility of one missile that may have been errant,'' but more 
study is needed to confirm the outcome, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Iraq, Basra governor Ahmed Ibrahim Hamash said two American  
aircraft fired five missiles that killed 11 people and injured 59. 
</P>
<P>
	The speculation centered on the AGM-130, a newly modified,  
rocket-powered missile launched by Air Force F-15E strike planes. 
The missile carries 2,000 pounds of explosives and is equipped with 
a guidance system that enables the crew of the launching aircraft 
to watch the missile's path on a television monitor and steer it to 
its target. 
</P>
<P>
	Zinni confirmed that AGM-130s were among the weapons fired in  
Monday's attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The official Iraqi News Agency said one American missile hit the  
al-Jumhuriya neighborhood of Basra, a southern port city, at 9:30 
a.m. (2:30 a.m. EST). Others hit 40 minutes later in the nearby 
village of Abu al-Khaseeb, as well as the Basra airport and an oil 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials said the American planes targeted an Iraqi SA-3  
surface-to-air missile battery north of Basra and ``associated 
integrated air defense systems.'' One official, speaking on 
condition of anonymity, said the associated targets were 
intelligence and communications links. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident near Basra was one of several confrontations in the  
skies over Iraq on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hours after the attack in southern Iraq, U.S. planes  
reported coming under fire by Iraqi surface-to-air missiles near 
the northern city of Mosul. They responded by firing laser-guided 
bombs and anti-radar missiles at the air defense sites. There was 
no word on damage on the ground, but Air Force officials said none 
of the U.S. planes was damaged in the attacks.

<HEADLINE> Baltimore Settles Shooting Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The family of a man shot and killed by a police  
officer for refusing to drop a knife settled their wrongful death 
lawsuit Tuesday as the trial was beginning. Terms were not 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	James Quarles' family had sued the city, the police commissioner  
and Officer Charles Smothers for $225 million following the Aug. 9, 
1997, shooting, which was caught on videotape outside a crowded 
city market. 
</P>
<P>
	The videotape showed several officers, with guns drawn,  
surrounding Quarles, 22. Smothers said Quarles appeared to be 
preparing to lunge at him with the 8-inch knife, which Quarles' 
family said he used to open packages of socks he sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses disputed the officer's statements, saying Quarles was  
bending over and appeared to be placing the knife on the ground. 
But prosecutors said they found no evidence that justified bringing 
charges against Smothers. 
</P>
<P>
	Smothers was fired in December 1997 after a police board found  
him guilty in a domestic violence incident involving his wife.

<HEADLINE> TCU Coach Sorry for Remarks to Refs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Texas Christian coach Billy Tubbs  
apologized to Western Athletic Conference referees Tuesday for 
remarks he made after the 24th-ranked Horned Frogs' recent loss to 
UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
	Tubbs and TCU athletic director Eric Hyman addressed the  
incident in a statement faxed to media outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyman said Tubbs confronted referees after Saturday night's  
95-88 overtime loss to the Rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not clear what happened in the confrontation, but Tubbs  
complained to reporters after the game about the opening-minute 
ejection of forward Lee Nailon for punching a UNLV player. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result of this encounter, the officials reported  
inappropriate conduct on the part of Coach Tubbs,'' Hyman said, 
further adding that TCU officials ``very much regret that this 
incident occurred.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Tubbs: ``I did not live up to my standards and the  
standards of the university. I apologize to the officials, the WAC, 
the university community and our fans. I hope we can put this 
behind us and move forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The WAC had announced no disciplinary action toward Tubbs by  
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Nailon, the WAC's leading scorer at 22.7 points per game, was  
automatically suspended for one game for throwing the punch. The 
Horned Frogs lost that game, 72-62 to Tulsa.

<HEADLINE> Hand Transplant Patient Doing Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Thirteen years after an explosive blew  
off his left hand, Matthew David Scott has a new one. 
</P>
<P>
	``He stares at it and grins,'' family friend James Brown said  
Monday as Scott, a paramedic from Absecon, N.J., recovered from the 
first hand transplant in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14 1/2-hour surgery ended early Monday at Jewish Hospital in  
Louisville. His doctors said Scott, 37, was doing as well as 
possible. They watched closely for blood clots, other complications 
and any sign that the donor hand was being rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't expect to see rejection in the early phase. Our big  
concern is in the first three months,'' said Dr. Jon William Jones 
Jr., an organ rejection expert who was part of the surgical team. 
</P>
<P>
	A hospital spokeswoman said today there were no blood clots or  
other complications overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is doing very well,'' Kim Freeman said. ``He's alert.  
Everything is progressing as expected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tiny pieces of skin from the hand will be microscopically  
examined every few days to see if lymphocytes -- tissue-killing 
cells -- are attacking it, Jones said. If so, Scott's medication 
could be adjusted. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott was being given powerful drugs that reduce the chances of  
rejection but pose significant dangers of their own. His suppressed 
immune system makes him vulnerable to infections that could be life 
threatening, said Jones and the lead surgeon, Dr. Warren 
Breidenbach. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott lost his dominant hand in a Dec. 23, 1985, blast from an  
M-80, which resembles a firecracker but is far more powerful. M-80s 
have been illegal in the United States since 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Courier-Journal before the surgery,  
Scott said the accident that cost him his hand came at a friend's 
house after a night of partying. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was 24,'' Scott said. ``It was Christmas. We were ... out at  
a club, laughing it up, having a good time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The firecracker was sitting out in the open. Scott said he  
``very foolishly'' picked it up, and, ``with a young man's 
bravado,'' touched his cigarette to the wick. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast from the M-80 tore most of his hand off, leaving parts  
of two fingers but little else. What remained was amputated above 
the wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott got a prosthetic hand and resumed working. In 1990, he was  
named National Paramedic of the Year by Emergency Medical Services 
magazine, said Tom Starr, director of the Mobile Intensive Care 
Unit at Virtua Health, where 
</P>
<P>
	Scott now oversees paramedic training in southern New Jersey. He  
also is assistant director of the School of Paramedic Science at 
Camden County College. 
</P>
<P>
	Some doctors have questioned the risks of transplanting a  
nonvital organ such as a hand. Breidenbach said Scott was chosen 
because he had not adapted well to his artificial hand and is 
intelligent, articulate and has support from his family, which 
includes his wife and two young sons. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott learned about the Louisville doctors' plans to attempt a  
hand transplant last summer, when his wife read a newspaper article 
while they were vacationing in London. He called the hospital hours 
after returning home. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview before his surgery, Scott said that with his  
artificial hand he lived in fear of going through buffet lines and 
handling food at parties. Nor was he able to show his sons how to 
play baseball, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always been the little things -- the daily little  
things,'' Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Scott can only hope to gain limited use of the  
transplanted hand -- able to pick up objects but unable to button 
his shirt, Breidenbach said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You should be able to get fairly good flexation and extension  
-- not complete -- and some sensation, but not normal,'' Breidenbach 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeons for years have been able to reattach severed limbs  
following accidents, but they had never been able to successfully 
transfer a limb from a dead donor to a living recipient. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, a hand transplant was performed in Lyon, France,  
on a New Zealand man who lost part of his right arm in a prison 
sawing accident in 1984. At least one attempt at a hand transplant 
occurred in South America in 1964, but the patient's body rejected 
the hand within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent surgery joined the cadaver hand a bit above  
wristwatch level with Scott's arm. The surgeons had to join the 
bones, clamping them together with metal plates and screws. Tendons 
were attached and gently tugged to make sure they would cause 
fingers to move. 
</P>
<P>
	Nerves were joined next, then arteries and veins. The hospital  
refused to disclose any information about the donor.

<HEADLINE> Militia Member Found Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) -- A member of the North American Militia  
has been convicted of plotting to blow up federal property and 
threatening to attack and murder government officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Graham also was found guilty Tuesday of growing marijuana  
to finance the conspiracy. The federal jury acquitted Graham on 
charges of possessing illegal machine guns seized from another 
militia member's home. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham, 42, faces up to 30 years in prison when he is sentenced  
May 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Lloyd Meyer called the verdict  
``tremendous'' even though jurors rejected three counts of the 
nine-count indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	``An armed and dangerous man is no longer walking the streets,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Jeffrey O'Hara said no decision about an appeal  
would be made until after sentencing. He had argued that Graham was 
being prosecuted for expressing unpopular beliefs in private 
telephone conversations the FBI recorded under court order. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the case had little to do with simple talk.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's being prosecuted for plotting to do terrible things he  
didn't do because he was stopped,'' Meyer said during closing 
arguments, standing in front of photos and maps the government 
contended targets Graham planned to attack. ``How much further did 
they have to go before someone got hurt?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graham is the second member of the militia group to be convicted  
in the case. In November, a federal jury found Bradford Metcalf, 
47, guilty on weapons and conspiracy charges. He will be sentenced 
in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges stem from a raid last year at Metcalf's home where  
authorities seized thousands of rounds of ammunition and loaded 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	A third co-defendant, Kenneth Carter, 47, is cooperating with  
the government and will be sentenced in April.

	Senate Debates Witnesses at Trial  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors are expected to press their  
case for testimony today with a shortened witnesses list. Rep. Asa 
Hutchinson, R-Ark., said Monica Lewinsky ``could offer a limited 
amount of new information.'' A source says the managers have 
already trimmed their list in an effort to keep wavering 
Republicans from agreeing with Democrats not to call witnesses and 
needlessly extend the trial. The list is said to include Ms. 
Lewinsky and Betty Currie, President Clinton's personal secretary. 
Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama said he is willing to listen to 
arguments for witnesses, but unless they show that testimony can 
offer something dramatically different, ``let's go on and vote the 
issue up or down.''

	ARMENIA, Colombia (AP) -- The death toll surpassed 1,000 today  
from a powerful earthquake that destroyed nearly two-thirds of all 
the buildings in this western Colombian city. It was the most 
damaging earthquake to strike the country in more than a century. 
But today, citizens cheered in the streets of downtown when the Red 
Cross rescued three men trapped in the rubble of a wrecked 
four-story building. The magnitude 6 quake flattened cities and 
towns across western Colombia. Red Cross officials said some 700 
buildings were destroyed and 180,000 people left homeless in 
Armenia alone.

	ABU FALOUS, Iraq (AP) -- Three U.S. aircraft fired on radar  
defenses in northern Iraq today even as Iraqis mourned relatives 
killed by what appeared to be errant American missiles in the 
country's south. Today's airstrikes occurred near the northern 
Iraqi city of Mosul, U.S. officials said. U.S. aircraft have been 
firing almost daily at Iraqi air defenses in the southern and 
northern no-fly zones in Iraq since American and British airstrikes 
in mid-December. Those attacks were aimed at punishing Iraq after 
U.N. arms inspectors reported that Baghdad was obstructing their 
work. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein vowed to retaliate for the 
deaths and damage.

United States. At his final public appearance last night, the Pope 
held a Mass before 110,000 people and decried drug trafficking, 
corruption and other evils of modern society. The Pope will depart 
Mexico City at 10:30 a.m. EST for St. Louis for the seventh stop on

torture and hostage-taking are not international crimes, but 
national crimes. Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 at a London hospital 
at the request of a Spanish magistrate seeking his extradition on 
charges or murder, torture and kidnapping during his 17-year 
regime. The warrant says Spaniards were among the victims slain 
after Pinochet overthrew elected Marxist Salvador Allende in 1973. 
The 83-year-old general is claiming immunity from prosecution as a

millions in a real-estate scam has been sentenced to 24 years in 
prison for fraud and money-laundering. William J. McCorkle and his 
wife, Chantal, were found guilty of charges stemming from a scheme 
worth more than $72 million in sales of videotapes, books and 
seminars promising a business partnership that would never exist. 
McCorkle's companies sold videos and pamphlets that promised to 
teach customers how to make money on foreclosed real estate. 
Federal prosecutors said McCorkle misled customers and refused to 
issue refunds when they were dissatisfied.

	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- The head of Stockholm's bid for the

	Prosecutors Want To See Clinton  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors today asked the Senate to  
``request the appearance'' of President Clinton at a deposition for 
his impeachment trial. The trial managers also sought subpoenas to 
question Monica Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon Jordan and 
White House aide Sidney Blumenthal. The White House, which has 
repeatedly said the president won't testify at the trial, denounced 
the request as a ``political play'' and said no further witnesses 
were needed. Prosecutors also asked permission to introduce three 
pieces of evidence that weren't in the official House impeachment 
record, including a record of phone calls between Clinton and Ms. 
Lewinsky.

	Pope Arrives in St. Louis

<P>
	St. LOUIS (AP) -- Pope John Paul II arrived in St. Louis today  
for his fifth trip to the U.S. mainland, a 30-hour stopover after 
his five-day visit to Mexico. When the papal plane landed, young 
people waiting at the Kiel Center to join the pope in a youth rally 
this evening reacted with a rousing cheer. About 600,000 people are 
expected to turn out for the pope's appearance. President Clinton 
arrived ahead of the pontiff's plane for their meeting, to take 
place in an airport hangar. Tomorrow, the 78-year-old pontiff is 
scheduled to celebrate Mass before 104,000 people at the Trans 
World Dome.

	Philippine Court Won't Spare Rapist  
</P>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- The Philippine Supreme Court today  
rejected a final appeal from a convicted child rapist, refusing to 
further delay the country's first judicial execution in 23 years. 
The court said the scheduled Feb. 5 execution by lethal injection 
of Leo Echegaray could proceed because Congress had been given a 
chance to review a law that reimposed the death penalty in 1994, 
and had decided not to do so. Echegaray was convicted of raping his 
10-year-old stepdaughter and had originally been scheduled to die 
on Jan. 4, but the Supreme Court ordered a last-minute delay to 
allow Congress a chance to review the death penalty law.

	Poor Countries Unprepared for Y2K  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most poor countries are unprepared for  
potential Year 2000 computer problems, raising concern they might 
have trouble obtaining food, health care and electricity, the World 
Bank said in a report today. The lack of preparation is most acute 
in sub-Sahara Africa, but countries in Asia, Latin America and the 
former Soviet Union also could be hard hit, the report said. Bank 
officials said that at the World Economic Forum next Monday, they 
and U.S. representatives will call for increased international 
cooperation to deal with the problem, including money to support a 
Y2K International Cooperation Center.

	Bill Hurts Role of Liberal Judaism  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- The Israeli parliament today narrowly passed a  
bill that is aimed at preventing liberal streams of Judaism from 
playing a more active role in Israel's day-to-day religious life. 
The bill requires representatives of the Reform and Conservative 
movements on local religious councils to pledge allegiance to the 
Orthodox Chief Rabbinate. The Chief Rabbinate dominates religious 
and personal status matters. The Reform and Conservative streams of 
Judaism are predominant in the United States, but have fewer 
followers in Israel. American Jewish leaders have warned the move 
would further divide Jews.

	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- New York Jets coach Bill Parcells has

reasons. Parcells, who never has coached in the game and begged off 
working the Senior Bowl last year, received permission from NFL 
commissioner Paul Tagliabue to skip the all-star game next month in 
Honolulu. Jets assistant head coach Bill Belichick will run the AFC 
team. Minnesota's Dennis Green will coach the NFC.

<HEADLINE> Team of Trekkers Reach South Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTT BASE, Antarctica (AP) -- Peter Hillary, the son of Mount  
Everest conqueror Sir Edmund Hillary, reached the South Pole with 
two other skiers today after an Antarctic journey beset by many 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	When their trip began, Hillary of New Zealand and his two  
Australian companions had hoped to ski trek from the Antarctic 
coast to the South Pole and return without airdrops or any other 
outside support. 
</P>
<P>
	But that goal was abandoned two weeks ago, after howling winds,  
blinding blizzards, unbelievable cold, illness and frostbite 
delayed their journey so often that the trio had to receive food 
from a helicopter from the Amundsen-Scott South Pole U.S. base. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that I've got here, everything seems worth it,'' Hillary  
said today, after his team reached the U.S. base about two weeks 
after the food drop. ``I wouldn't want to be anywhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hillary and his companions hauled their 395-pound sleds into the  
United States station at the pole at 5:17 p.m. local time. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview with TVNZ, a New Zealand television  
station, Hillary said: ``The American people at the South Pole have 
been most hospitable. A hundred of them came out and cheered. 
They've given us a wonderful meal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By reaching the South Pole, Hillary and his father became the  
first father and son to reach the bottom of the world. Sir Edmund 
Hillary was also part of a trans-Antarctic expedition in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter also has duplicated his father's famous 1953 ascent of  
Mount Everest, the world's highest mountain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congratulations Peter, on this marvelous achievement of  
reaching the Pole,'' Sir Edmund Hillary told his son in a message. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's Queen Elizabeth II congratulated the trio ``on your  
notable achievement,'' in a message read to them on their Iridium 
mobile phone as they stood at the pole. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillary said it was ``a marvelous feeling'' to have ski trekked  
more than 875 miles from the Antarctic coast to the pole through 
all sorts of obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
	The same problems that eventually killed British explorer Robert  
F. Scott and his companions during their 1911-12 bid to march to 
the South Pole and back thwarted the attempt by Hillary and 
teammates Eric Philips and Jon Muir. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the three are expected to fly to New Zealand's  
Scott Base on Ross Island, where their journey began. From there, 
the trekkers will return to New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, top government officials from 24 countries are  
meeting in Antarctica to discuss the continent and the threats that 
it faces, including a fishing dispute and a boom in tourism. 
</P>
<P>
	During his interview from the South Pole, Hillary was asked if  
he had ever feared that his team wouldn't make it to the pole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I may not make it during the storms and with  
temperatures at -50 degrees Celsius (58 below Fahrenheit),'' he 
said. ``But I guess you have to see it through. You have to stick 
with it.''

</P>
<P>
	SANDISFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- Bill Crofut, a musician who recorded  
more than 20 albums and whose repertoire stretched from Bach to 
blues and beyond, died Monday of cancer. He was 64. 
</P>
<P>
	Crofut, a banjo player, took up the instrument in 1955. After  
performing in coffeehouses and clubs with a high school friend, his 
career was launched when Adlai Stevenson asked the folk-singing duo 
to play at the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	They performed a parody, written by Crofut and sung to the tune  
of the ``Twelve Days of Christmas,'' about President John F. 
Kennedy and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev. 
</P>
<P>
	He recorded folk duets with British baritone Benjamin Luzon and  
banjo renditions of the classical music of Brahms, Mozart, and 
Schumann. Recently, he teamed up with Chris Brubeck, and in 1996, 
they recorded an album with soprano Frederica von Stade.

	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Jimmy Day, a steel guitarist who  
performed with Willie Nelson and became one of the most in-demand 
musicians in Nashville, died Friday from heart failure after a 
battle with cancer. He was 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Day hit it big in 1956 playing steel guitar with Ray Price on  
the hit ``Crazy Arms.'' He played on Nelson's classic ``Shotgun 
Willie'' album, and hits like ``Pick Me Up on Your Way Down'' by 
Charlie Walker and Price's ``Heartaches By the Number'' and ``City 
Lights.'' 
</P>

	NEW IBERIA, La. (AP) -- James M. ``Jimmy'' Domengeaux, a  
guitarist with the Grammy-nominated band, Steve Riley &AMP; The Mamou 
Playboys, died Monday in a motorcycle accident. He was 44. 
</P>
<P>
	Domengeaux, wrecked his motorcycle on U.S. 90 and was struck by  
two motorists as he lay on the pavement. State police are awaiting 
a coroner's report to try to determine whether he died as a result 
of the fall or by one of the vehicles that struck him. 
</P>
<P>
	A musician for 38 years, Domengeaux was known for his versatile  
guitar playing. He first rose to prominence in the late 1970s and 
early '80s with the hard rock group Black Dog, a band that fused 
rock and ``swamp'' pop. 
</P>
<P>
	But Domengeaux really shined with Steve Riley &AMP; The Mamou  
Playboys, whose sound made them popular in roots music circles and 
mainstays on the international festival circuit. The group 
performed worldwide, won numerous awards from the Cajun French 
Music Association and was nominated for a Grammy award in 1993.

</P>
<P>
	He served as the Giants' coordinator from 1993-97 and was a  
special assignment scout for the team last year. 
</P>
<P>
	His baseball career spanned 48 years. A former infielder, he

Chicago Cubs after a knee injury ended his playing career.

	PARIS (AP) -- Elie Kagan, a freelance photographer who captured  
the bloody scenes of a 1961 crackdown on Algerians in Paris during 
which dozens were killed, died Monday, the newspaper Le Monde 
reported. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Kagan's widely published photographs of the victims, including  
people lying in pools of blood, were some of the few sources of 
independent information available on the Oct. 17, 1961, repression. 
</P>
<P>
	French authorities hid the scope of the crackdown on the  
Algerians who were beaten, shot and thrown into the Seine River 
during a protest tied to Algerian independence. Initially, 
officials had insisted that only seven people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 25,000 Algerians, responding to a call by Algeria's  
National Liberation Front, demonstrated to protest a curfew on 
their community. 
</P>
<P>
	Some historians said at least 200 people were killed; Algerian  
groups put the figure at 300. Algeria won independence from France 
in 1962.

liver cancer. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Mosse escaped the Nazis at age 19 by way of Switzerland. Along  
with numerous articles and essays, Mosse authored many books, 
including ``Toward the Final Solution: A History of European 
Racism,'' considered one of the first and most important studies of 
the intellectual roots of the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	He taught at the University of Iowa, then joined the University  
of Wisconsin-Madison faculty in 1955. He also taught at the

<HEADLINE> Teen-Agers Fill Arena To Hear Pope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A sports arena filled to the rafters with  
20,000 teen-agers and pulsing with rock music gave Pope John Paul 
II a raucous welcome to St. Louis on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``John Paul II, we love you!'' they chanted at a dangerous  
decibel level as he entered the Kiel Center in a white stretch golf 
cart and slowly made his way to a simple wooden throne. 
</P>
<P>
	Nuns danced, bishops swayed and clapped and friars in monastic  
robes kicked up their sandals as the pope was serenaded with an 
ear-splitting medley of soul, gospel and spiritual rock. 
</P>
<P>
	Delighted by the reception, the 78-year-old pontiff pounded the  
arms of his chair and raised his trembling left hand in a 
prizefighter's gesture. 
</P>
<P>
	The arena is home to hockey's St. Louis Blues, the Bilikins  
basketball team and the Ambush, a pro soccer team. The 
sports-loving pontiff, an expert linguist, quickly mastered the 
language of youth by mentioning all three teams in his sermon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today this impressive stadium has become another kind of  
training ground,'' he said. ``Not for hockey or soccer or 
basketball, but for training that will help you live your faith 
more decisively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Enormous applause and laughter greeted his mention of the  
excitement in St. Louis during the home run competition last summer 
between Sammy Sosa and the St. Louis Cardinals' Mark McGwire. John 
Paul urged his audience to show the same enthusiasm in bringing 
Jesus Christ'smessage to the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Fireworks lit up the night and the 630-foot Gateway Arch was  
bathed in light as the pope left the arena to return to the 
archbishop's residence. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the pope arrived in this Gateway City of the West,  
even before he left Mexico, the party had begun -- the frenzied sort 
of foot-stomping, hand-clapping, steel guitar-twanging youth rally 
that has become a trademark of his papacy. 
</P>
<P>
	For more than three hours, a surging tide of teen-age exuberance  
flowed from the banks of the Mississippi to the Kiel Center. And to 
a nearby grassy park, where a couple of thousand more without 
tickets could cheer his motorcade and respond to blessings from the 
Popemobile with spirited high fives. 
</P>
<P>
	The hometown of Scott Joplin and Miles Davis, of Chuck Berry and  
Tina Turner, serenaded the music-loving pope all day long with a 
maxi-volume medley of soul, gospel, reggae, swing, ska, hard rock, 
Nashville country, Polish hymns and Irish ballads. 
</P>
<P>
	By the thousands, teen-agers arrived in school buses and  
sightseeing charters. They bunked down in sleeping bags and 
bedrolls in church halls, school cafeterias and gyms around the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never saw so many kids in my life,'' said St. Louis bus  
driver Reginald Davis, waiting for a break in the line of march to 
get back downtown. ``And they're so well-behaved. Some came from as 
far away as Chicago and Detroit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pope first got the idea of preaching Christian ideals  
directly to young people as an ethics professor at Poland's Lublin 
University, when he took his students on hiking trips. 
</P>
<P>
	``Youth really dig him,'' said Jason Divona, who came from  
Louisville, Ky., and spent the night on the gym floor at St. Mary's 
school. ``He speaks our language. When he's with kids, he really 
lights up. You can see it in his face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carole Lingstrom, 16, from across the river in Belleville, Ill.,  
defined his charisma as ``totally awesome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For months 155 cloistered nuns in convents around the city had  
prayed up a non-storm. Their prayers were answered with warm 
January sunshine; a 10-foot ice crucifix, set on the stage at the 
youth concert, quickly began to drip away. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports venues turned into temporary cathedrals seemed to fit the  
worship style of this pope, who was an expert mountain climber, 
canoeist and skier. 
</P>
<P>
	The prayer rally at the hockey arena came a day after the pope  
blessed a crowd of 1.1 million at an auto raceway in Mexico City. 
On Wednesday, John Paul will celebrate Mass in the huge Trans World 
Dome, home of football's St. Louis Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	The pontiff has presided at religious ceremonies in bullrings,  
soccer arenas, Yankee Stadium and racetracks in Paris, Poland, 
Ireland and New York.

<HEADLINE> Poor Countries Unprepared for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The World Bank is warning poor nations that  
time is running out to deal with potential Year 2000 computer 
problems. It is urging them to make contingency plans for systems 
that may not be ready in time or to return to manual operations. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report the bank said many of these nations are so  
unprepared they may experience difficulties in providing their 
citizens with food, health care and electricity. Sub-Saharan Africa 
heads a list of regions where lack of preparation is acute, but 
Asia, Latin America and countries in the former Soviet Union could 
be hard hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this age of globalization and computerization, doing  
nothing is not an option,'' Joyce Amenta, the bank's Y2K 
coordinator, said Tuesday. ``Developed and developing countries 
must act in their own self-interest to fix the problem, and time is 
getting short.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The high-tech threat could occur if computers fail when the year  
changes to 2000 next Jan. 1. Because they were written to recognize 
only the last two digits of a year, many computer programs could 
read the digits ``00'' as 1900 instead of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Predictions vary widely on what might happen at the end of the  
century and range from electrical outages to financial instability 
to civil disorder. Air transport and oil shipments could be 
disrupted. 
</P>
<P>
	In a survey of 139 countries' Y2K preparedness, the bank found  
that 54 had national policies in place but only 21 had taken 
concrete steps to reduce their exposure. Naming a national 
coordinator for the problem is not a measure of a country's 
preparedness, the bank said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank officials said they would join with U.S. representatives at  
an economic conference next week in Davos, Switzerland, to call for 
increased cooperation to deal with the problem. They are expected 
to discuss ways to fund a Y2K International Cooperation Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``If ever there was a time for collaboration, partnership and  
sharing of information, this is it,'' said George West, a bank 
information technology specialist. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the bank has lent $30 million to Argentina for Y2K  
preparation and approved $29 million for Sri Lanka last week. Other 
loans are under consideration or the bank may add preparation 
programs to existing loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Another specialist, Hugh Sloan, said there was a false  
impression that the Y2K bug is more of a problem for industrial 
countries and the low level of automation in developing countries 
may safeguard them from the problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``But actually, the impact could in fact be greater because the  
developing countries are dependent on fewer and older computing 
systems and they have many more competing national interests for 
scarce resources,'' Sloan said.

<HEADLINE> `Iphigenia' a Not So Tragic Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With ``The Iphigenia Cycle,'' director JoAnne  
Akalaitis delivers a double dose of Greek tragedy, pairing 
Euripides' ``Iphigenia in Aulis'' with his ``Iphigenia in Tauris'' 
for a three-hour journey into self-indulgence. 
</P>
<P>
	Poor Euripides. Would he recognize his works, written some 2,400  
years ago, in this bizarre, mod interpretation? They are 
strenuously played by actors dressed in hip, thrift-shop costumes 
on a sleek, illuminated set of all-white bleachers, which fill the 
stage at off-Broadway's American Place Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Akalaitis unsubtly tells the tale of Iphigenia, daughter of  
Agamemnon and Clytemnestra. The girl must be sacrificed to the gods 
before the Greek army can set sail for Troy to avenge the abduction 
of the alluring but no-good Helen. We know she is no good because 
the actors spit on the ground whenever the vixen's name is 
mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
	Part 1 has Iphigenia dithering over whether to accept her fate.  
Mom Clytemnestra is adamantly opposed to the sacrifice. Dad 
Agamemnon dupes his daughter, getting her to come to Aulis on the 
pretext of marrying her off to the blustery military hero Achilles. 
</P>
<P>
	At first Iphigenia resists, but gradually comes to believe that  
it is her duty to die for the greater good -- a victory over Troy. 
</P>
<P>
	By the evening's second half, Agamemnon is dead, done in by  
Clytemnestra, who in turn, has been slain by Orestes, Iphigenia's 
brother. Iphigenia has been saved by the goddess Artemis who sends 
her into exile in Tauris where she is eventually reunited with her 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
	The chorus of Greek women scamper up and down those bleachers,  
which in Act 2 are spotted in blood. Akalaitis has these gals 
emoting at high pitch. By the time the goddess Athena -- a ringer 
for Aretha Franklin but, alas, without a rendition of ``Respect'' -- 
arrives to close the play, the audience is exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
	What disappears is any sense of tragedy. Contrast the tepid  
meeting between Iphigenia and Orestes here with Orestes' 
heartbreaking reunion with another sister in the Broadway 
production of ``Electra.'' There is no comparison. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the acting comes in two variations -- overwrought or  
bewildered. The one exception is Anne Dudek in the title role. She 
can handle anything Akalaitis throws at her -- which is a lot of 
rapid-fire patter in Nicholas Rudall's accessible new translations. 
</P>
<P>
	The cycle's toughest assignment goes to Taylor Price, who plays  
the aggressive, outraged Achilles in Act 1, and then, in the second 
act, the even more psychotic Orestes. The director turns Orestes 
into a stutterer. Price's concentration under fire -- the evening's 
Purple Heart performance -- is astonishing. 
</P>
<P>
	This production, originally done at the Court Theater in  
Chicago, is presented by Theater for a New Audience, a usually 
reliable producer of imaginative Shakespeare revivals. Here excess 
outruns imagination by a long, long mile.

<HEADLINE> Demand for Big U.S. Motorcycles Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The telltale low-pitch staccato of an  
American-made, big twin-cylinder motorcycle breaks the quiet of the 
clear desert night on a lonely stretch of road. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a throbbing sound that for many summons up feelings of  
adventure and daring. And it's attracting a growing number of 
middle-aged men and women. After a couple of decades of hard work, 
they can now afford to live a little on the edge, gliding along on 
a twisting rural blacktop. 
</P>
<P>
	The demand to get into the leather saddle of one of these  
thundering, high-powered, two-wheel adult toys is greater than the 
ability of the current king of American-made bikes, Harley-Davidson 
Inc., to fill it. 
</P>
<P>
	Since going public in 1986, production at Milwaukee-based Harley  
has grown from 37,000 to 148,000 in 1998, with 160,000 planned for 
next year. The company hopes to build 200,000 motorcycles in its 
centennial year of 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't like to measure our business by the number of people  
on our waiting list and we're opening new plants to meet the 
demand,'' Harley spokesman Chris Romoser said. 
</P>
<P>
	With an industry estimated 40,000-bike shortfall that has some  
Harley dealers showing customers colored brochures instead of real 
bikes, a new generation of big V-twin bike builders are licking 
their chops to serve those who just can't wait to ride. 
</P>
<P>
	Big twins descend from early motorcycles that used cylinders  
from radial aircraft engines built in World War I. Unlike 
four-cylinder Japanese cycles which have a smoother, higher-pitched 
sound, Harleys have two massive cylinders pitched at a 45-degree 
angle which fire almost simulataneously, creating a unique 
throbbing sound. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is something primeval in it that people just like,''  
said Matt Chambers, founder of Confederate Motorcycles an 
8-year-old bike manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23 employees at the Abita Springs, La., company crank out  
five bikes a week and plan to increase that to 25 by yearend. The 
bikes can cost up to $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Other bikes in the new generation have names like Titan,  
Polaris, Indian and Boar. 
</P>
<P>
	``Competition is nothing new to us and it will make us better,''  
said Harley's Romoser. ``But we're the only true American original 
and they are just copies of the original.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harley celebrated its 95th anniversary this year by introducing  
a more powerful and, supposedly, more reliable 88-cubic-inch engine 
to succeed the 80-inch Evolution engine introduced 15 years ago. 
It's intended to keep pace with the growing number of 
higher-performance Harley-style bikes. 
</P>
<P>
	In Phoenix, Titan Motorcycle Co. has seen revenues grow from  
$607,000 in 1995 to a projected $30 million in 1998. The 
publicly-traded company plans to build 3,000 bikes in 2000, chief 
executive officer Frank Keery said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the baby boomer generation jumping onto the band wagon,''  
said Mark Green, Titan's marketing director. ``Our customers are in 
the 35-to-55 age group earning over $70,000 a year. They've worked 
hard all their life and now they want something extra.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Titan is doubling its space to build customized models ranging  
up to $30,000 and plans to debut a less expensive model that will 
sell for under $20,000, Green said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Minneapolis, Polaris Industries Inc., a publicly-traded  
manufacturer of snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles and personal 
watercraft, started building motorcycles this past summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Buyers are already lined up for the first 3,000 Victory  
motorcycles, and Polaris plans to increase production next year. 
The bikes start at $13,000 -- the middle range for a Harley. 
</P>
<P>
	And there are lots of other U.S. bikes about to come on the  
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Excelsior-Henderson Motorcycle Co. built its first bike in late  
December and expects to begin mass production of cruiser and 
touring motorcycles at a new $30 million plant in Belle Plaine, 
Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	The publicly-traded company was founded in 1993 by brothers  
David and Daniel Hanlon, but the company's name dates back to the 
early 1900s when the now-defunct Excelsior Supply Co. was one of 
the top motorcycle manufacturers. The old Excelsior went out of 
business during the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
	And in December, a federal court in Denver approved IMCOA  
Licensing America Inc.'s right to resurrect the legendary Indian 
motorcycle, ending three years of legal wrangling involving dozens 
of companies and creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	IMCOA attorney Lee Kutner said the partnership of California and  
Canadian motorcycle companies has a number of Indian motorcycles 
ready to hit the road, the first to be sold since 1953. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of demand,'' he said. ``You'll be seeing classic  
Indian Motorcycles back on the street in short order.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's also Big Dog Motorcycles in Wichita, Kan., whose 90  
employees (up from 18 in 1995) build models ranging from about 
$19,000 to $27,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Another high-end manufacturer is Boar Motorcycle Co., of Naples,  
Fla., which sells models for $28,000 to $34,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's the baby boomers and yuppies out looking to have  
some fun,'' said Boar's general manager, Lori Dean. ``Most of our 
customers are doctors and lawyers in the 45-50 age range.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If you really want some asphalt-ripping power, there's Boss  
Hoss, which, instead of a big twin, squeezes a 283-cubic-inch 
Chevrolet V8 into a motorcycle frame for a bike tipping the scale 
at over a half-ton. The car would be cheaper, but it couldn't go 
from zero to 100 mph in 6 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Sports Fever bar in Phoenix, Jeff Johnston said he rides  
a Harley 1200 Sportster. He can't say for sure what the attraction 
is. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just like them,'' said Johnston, a 40-year-old dental  
technician. ``Probably because they are American made.''

<HEADLINE> Warner-Lambert To Acquire Agouron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Warner-Lambert Co. agreed Tuesday to a $2.1  
billion stock deal to buy Agouron Pharmaceuticals Inc., giving the 
company control of Agouron's wildly successful AIDS product. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, each share of Agouron stock will be  
exchanged for about $60 worth of Warner-Lambert stock, providing 
the price is between $64.52 and $74 at the close of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Agouron closed at $56.81 1/4, up $3.66 in trading on the  
Nasdaq Stock Market. Shares of Warner-Lambert closed up $1.62 1/2 to 
$69.12 1/2 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Agouron will continue to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of  
Warner-Lambert and retain its current management structure, company 
spokeswoman Donna Nichols said. 
</P>
<P>
	Agouron, a San Diego biotechnology company that develops drugs  
for treatment of cancer, AIDS and eye diseases, had total revenues 
of $467 million last year. The company has been an innovator in 
designing synthetic drugs that target the molecular level of 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Agouron's Viracept product, a protease inhibitor for people  
infected with HIV, the virus which causes AIDS, brought in $308 
million during its first full year on the market after it was 
introduced in March 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition will allow Agouron to continue its research and  
development of treatments while giving it Warner-Lambert's 
financial muscle to get those drugs on the market, company 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a carefully considered strategic move to maximize  
Agouron's long-term ability to bring forward new drugs for patients 
confronted by cancer, viral infection, and diseases of the eye and, 
at the same time, to contribute its scientific strengths to 
Warner-Lambert's efforts to discover innovative drugs in other 
important fields,'' Agouron President Peter Johnson said in a 
prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Agouron will remain in San Diego's La Jolla headquarters, with  
Johnson reporting to Warner-Lambert's New Jersey headquarters. 
Company officials said employee cutbacks weren't immediately 
expected and would only involve redundant positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Agouron employs more than 1,000 people; about 700 are involved  
in research and development. Warner-Lambert employs more than 
40,000 people worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale is subject to acceptance by Agouron shareholders and  
regulatory approval.

<HEADLINE> Md. Police Hope To Reduce Homicides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Baltimore police are giving neighborhood  
commanders more authority in an effort to reduce crime and the 
city's high homicide rate, more than four times that of New York 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore, the nation's 14th-largest city with 650,000  
residents, has had in excess of 300 murders a year for the past 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	To bring that rate down, homicide detectives will focus on  
specific areas of the city and work closely with district 
lieutenants, who will have greater responsibility and authority in 
dealing with crime in their precincts. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the reorganization, the city's 60 homicide detectives  
will begin next month to work with detectives who investigate 
non-fatal shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always recognized that a shooting is an unsuccessful  
homicide,'' said Col. John Gavrilis, commander of the Criminal 
Investigations Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	Both groups of detectives will be supervised by a high-level  
commander, who will also supervise efforts to combat youth crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Police administrators say the changes will help officers work  
more efficiently in the city's most troubled neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want your decision-making authority at the closest point  
of execution,'' Commissioner Thomas Frazier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry Brownstein, director of the graduate program in  
criminology at the University of Baltimore, said concentrating 
detectives may help in areas most affected by violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
	What has frustrated police, city politicians and residents is  
that, aside from the high number of homicides, violent crime is 
down more than 30 percent over the past 2 1/2 years. Property crime 
also has decreased substantially. 
</P>
<P>
	Some city residents are optimistic about the changes.  
</P>
<P>
	Cleoda Walker, public safety chairwoman for a Cherry Hill  
neighborhood group, said the plan will help efforts to make her 
community safer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Crime prevention is everybody's business,'' Ms. Walker said.  
``This plan sets up togetherness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Jesse Oden, who works in Cherry Hill, said the new plan is  
good, even if it means more work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before, if anything happened, the first thing a lieutenant  
said was, `It didn't happen on my shift,''' he said. ``Now whatever 
happens, it's yours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With about 46 deaths per 100,000 people, Baltimore's murder rate  
is about four times that of New York City.

<HEADLINE> McDonald's Profits Match Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- McDonald's Corp. said Tuesday its fourth-quarter  
profits rose 9 percent, with strong sales in the United States and 
Europe offsetting weaker revenues caused by economic troubles 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also announced a 2-for-1 stock split effective March  
5. McDonald's share price has risen 61 percent in the past year on 
strong confidence in the company's domestic turnaround strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	For the three months that ended Dec. 31, the Oak Brook,  
Ill.-based chain reported net income of $447.1 million, or 64 cents 
a diluted share, compared to $410.9 million, or 58 cents a diluted 
share, in the comparable period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Both quarters include charges taken to restructure and introduce  
a just-in-time ordering system to domestic restaurants. Excluding 
those, income rose 13 percent to $783.2 million from $695.2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings matched Wall Street expectations, according to a  
survey of analysts by First Call Corp. In morning trading on the 
New York Stock Exchange, shares of McDonald's rose $2.93 3/4, or 4 
percent, to $78.81 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Systemwide sales rose 9 percent to $3.22 billion from $2.95  
billion. The company does not reveal exact figures from stores open 
at least a year, an industry measure of performance, but said it 
saw ``positive'' results. 
</P>
<P>
	During the year, the company capitalized on its promotion tie-in  
with Disney to increase its Happy Meal sales. It also benefited 
from increased sales of larger sandwiches with Monopoly, Big Mac 
and Teenie Beanie Baby promotions. The company this year plans to 
revive Teenie Beanie Babies for a third time; analysts say the 
previous two promotions are the all-time leaders in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say McDonald's has experienced a remarkable turnaround  
in the past year as it decentralized its domestic operations to 
give grumbling franchisees more say in developing their menus and 
planning promotions. The company also has benefited from increased 
expansion overseas, particularly in Europe, where revenues soon 
will exceed domestic sales despite having far fewer restaurants per 
capita.

<HEADLINE> Study: Parkinson's Not Inherited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Most cases of Parkinson's disease are not due to  
a genetic defect but are caused by other factors that are probably 
environmental, according to a landmark study of more than 17,000 
twins. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time, today we can say that for people with  
Parkinson's disease diagnosed after age 50, it's most commonly 
caused by environmental factors,'' said Dr. Caroline M. Tanner of 
the Parkinson's Institute in Sunnyvale, Calif., who led the study. 
It is published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The environmental factors are unknown but may include chemical  
exposures, diet and smoking -- the last of which paradoxically seems 
to lessen the risk of developing Parkinson's, she added in a 
teleconference call Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A genetic cause is most common in the approximately 10 percent  
of people with the disease who are diagnosed before age 50, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 1 million Americans have Parkinson's, Tanner said,  
making it second only to Alzheimer's disease in frequency as a 
degenerative disease of the brain and nerves. 
</P>
<P>
	Parkinson causes slow deterioration of the nerves' ability to  
control the muscles. It usually starts with small tremors, then 
progresses to a shuffling gait and increasing weakness. There is no 
cure, and drug therapy tends to lose effectiveness over time. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, researchers identified a long-sought gene defect that  
can cause a form of Parkinson's, but the proportion of cases 
arising from the defect was unknown before this study. 
</P>
<P>
	In the new study, researchers tracked down more than 17,000 men  
enrolled in a World War II-era twin registry. The researchers found 
161 twin pairs in which at least one brother had Parkinson's 
disease and data on the pairs was complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 161 sets, there were 16 in which Parkinson's had  
struck before age 50. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the four sets of identical twins, who have exactly the same  
genetic material, both brothers had Parkinson's. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 12 fraternal pairs, who share only half their genetic  
material, there were only two in which both brothers had 
Parkinson's. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers calculated that if one twin developed the disease by  
age 50, the other was six times more likely to get it if he were an 
identical twin than if he were a fraternal twin. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanner said environmental factors most likely to play a role in  
typical Parkinson's include exposure to chemicals such as 
pesticides and herbicides, diet and tobacco smoking. The apparent 
protective effect of smoking was found in the twins and in previous 
research, Tanner said. 
</P>
<P>
	She and Dr. J. William Langston, president of the Parkinson's  
Institute and senior author, said the protection is probably real, 
perhaps caused by smoking's stimulation of the liver to produce 
enzymes that neutralize some toxin that would otherwise provoke 
Parkinson's. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there are about 2,000 chemicals in cigarette smoke, so we  
still have a big job ahead of us in finding what chemicals might 
actually be protective,'' Langston said. ``And we don't recommend 
smoking to prevent Parkinson's disease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An expert not involved in the study said it presents a  
compelling reason to search for better treatments, since the drugs 
now available may lessen symptoms but don't really attack the 
disease or prevent disability. 
</P>
<P>
	And surgery is promising but still largely experimental, noted  
Dr. Jeffrey L. Cummings of the University of California, Los 
Angeles. In an editorial accompanying the study, he recommended 
that the new findings should refocus research on environmental 
triggers for typical Parkinson's disease and genetic influences in 
early-onset disease.

<HEADLINE> Wall St. Stocks End Mixed / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Big-name stocks and technology issues rose for a  
second straight day Tuesday as some high-profile companies 
announced stock splits, dividend increases and earnings that met or 
exceeded expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 121.26 to 9,324.58,  
leaving it 220 points shy of its closing record of 9,544.97 on Jan. 
6. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index rose 64.10 to 2,433.41, and the  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite index rose 18.33 to 1,252.31. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's rally was largely confined to well-known companies.  
Declining issues ran even with advancers on the New York Stock 
Exchange, where volume was moderately heavy at 872.42 million 
shares, up from Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Some individual index components shone. The Dow was led higher  
by IBM, whose shares rose 3 5/8 to 185 5/8 after the company confirmed 
Monday's rumors that it would split, exchanging two shares for each 
one held by investors. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM was joined by another Dow component, McDonald's, which also  
announced a two-for-one split and raised its dividend. McDonald's 
stock rose 3 1/16 to 78 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wall Street has splits on its brain here,'' said Larry  
Wachtel, Prudential Securities' market strategist. 
</P>
<P>
	In a stock split, a company increases the number of shares  
outstanding without increasing its total market value. A share 
valued at $100, for example, might be exchanged for two shares 
valued at $50, or three shares worth $33.33 apiece. Stock splits 
are usually undertaken to make expensive shares more affordable. 
</P>
<P>
	Many investors interpret splits as an indication that a company  
believes its already-expensive stock will go even higher, although 
that doesn't always happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's two pieces of paper for one piece of paper, and yet it's  
embraced, it's loved, it's wonderful,'' Wachtel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, earnings reports boosted drug makers, including Dow  
components Merck and Johnson &AMP; Johnson, which both met analysts' 
fourth-quarter estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Johnson &AMP; Johnson took a smaller-than-expected  
restructuring charge, and company officials said it would seek 
approval for its new cholesterol-lowering margarine, which it hopes 
to have on the market this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck rose 6 1/2 to 144, and Johnson &AMP; Johnson gained 3 13/16 to  
82 5/8.

<HEADLINE> Miami, Ohio Selects Assistant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Miami University has chosen one of Randy Walker's assistants to  
succeed him as head football coach, a source told The Associated 
Press on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Hoeppner, assistant head coach and defensive coordinator  
under Walker, will be the school's 31st head coach, according to a 
source speaking on condition of anonymity. Hoeppner did not return 
a telephone message. 
</P>
<P>
	The university in Oxford, Ohio called a news conference for 11  
a.m. Wednesday to introduce Walker's successor. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker left last Wednesday to become head coach at Northwestern,  
ending a nine-year coaching career in Oxford that was the 
second-longest in the school's history. Walker holds the school 
records for most wins (59) and games (99). 
</P>
<P>
	Hoeppner has spent 13 seasons as an assistant at Miami, which  
finished 10-1 last season and has had a winning record each of the 
last five years. Hoeppner's defense ranked No. 2 in the country in 
yards allowed in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoeppner played with the St. Louis Cardinals and Green Bay  
Packers. He spent six years as defensive coordinator at Franklin 
College in Indiana, his alma mater, before going to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati Enquirer reported Tuesday that Sherman Smith, a  
star at Miami in the 1970s, had withdrawn from consideration for 
the coaching job so he would not have to move his family. Smith is 
running backs coach for the Tennessee Oilers.

<HEADLINE> Packers' Lewis Ready To Call Plays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- It's official: Sherm Lewis is over his  
latest snub and he's returning to Green Bay to serve as Ray Rhodes' 
offensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	After failing once again to land a head coaching job, Lewis  
decided to stay in Green Bay, where he'll be in charge of calling 
plays for the first time in his 17-year career as an NFL assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to it. It's a big challenge to get this  
offense back to the Super Bowl,'' said Lewis, passed up for the 
Chicago Bears' head coaching job last weekend, the last of nine 
openings in the league. ``I've got more responsibility now, so I'm 
excited. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody says that's why I can't get a head-coaching job,  
that I've never called the plays, so this will eliminate that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others contend Lewis, who is black, is a victim of racial  
prejudice in the hiring process. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Packers coach Mike Holmgren, who brought Lewis with him  
to Green Bay from San Francisco's staff in 1992, touted him as the 
best assistant in the league, and Minnesota Vikings coach Dennis 
Green said it would be a travesty if Lewis didn't get a 
head-coaching job this winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``What more credence do you need than to have your boss say  
you're the best and for your chief rival to say you're the most 
qualified?'' Lewis' agent, Bob LaMonte, said during the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lewis got just two interviews, both with the Bears, who  
bungled their search before settling on Jacksonville defensive 
coordinator Dick Jauron. 
</P>
<P>
	It was just the second time an NFL team had shown serious  
interest in Lewis, who owns four Super Bowl rings and has been to 
the playoffs 14 times in his 16 seasons as an assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, he interviewed for Dallas' head coaching job, which  
eventually went to Chan Gailey. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last three seasons, there have been 24 head coach  
openings in the NFL, and Rhodes, who was hired when Holmgren went 
to Seattle, is the only black candidate to get hired. 
</P>
<P>
	There are only three black head coaches in the NFL: Rhodes,  
Green and Tampa Bay's Tony Dungy. 
</P>
<P>
	But with Lewis' hiring, the Packers are the first team in NFL  
history with a black coach and two black coordinators; Rhodes 
brought Emmitt Thomas with him from Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren's hands-on approach definitely hurt Lewis' credentials.  
</P>
<P>
	He let Lewis call all the plays in the Packers' regular-season  
finale at Chicago, when Green Bay eked out a victory despite 
resting several injured starters. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, who designed the plays Holmgren used to call during  
games, laughed when asked if his new responsibilities will bolster 
his credentials for a head-coaching job down the line. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will either make them better or worse,'' he said. ``One of  
the two.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	No one is going to replace Michael Jordan on the Chicago Bulls.  
Brent Barry knows he's merely filling MJ's spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry, the former NBA slam dunk champion and son of Hall of  
Famer Rick Barry, signed a six-year, $27 million contract Monday 
with the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	The free agent will take over the shooting guard role left by  
Jordan's retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no fun to be part of the cleanup crew, but hopefully that  
will only last a year or two and you get back to where the team was 
before,'' Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry liked the reports he heard on new coach Tim Floyd, and  
that convinced him to sign with the decimated NBA champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm silly to come here, but he is crazy to be coaching here,''  
Barry said. ``That's the way I look at it. Any guy that crazy I 
want to play for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barry averaged 9.6 points per game in three seasons with the Los  
Angeles Clippers and Miami Heat. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he does play well in Chicago, then they think they've got  
the next Michael Jordan,'' Miami coach Pat Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Clippers got good news when they learned Michael  
Olowokandi, the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft from Pacific 
University, was released from his contract with Kinder Bologna of 
the Italian League. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7-foot-1 center had signed with Kinder about 24 hours before  
the NBA and its players agreed recently to end the owners' lockout. 
Olowokandi's deal with Kinder bound him to the club until Feb. 15, 
but the team reportedly decided to release him and save money 
because he had averaged only 7.7 points and 5.6 rebounds in six 
games in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a surprise to me,'' Clippers vice president of  
basketball operations Elgin Baylor said. ``I'm sure it's probably a 
surprise to him, too, that they let him out of his contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor expects Olowokandi to join the team Wednesday night in  
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Steve Nash, acquired in a draft-day trade from Phoenix,  
signed a six-year contract extension with the Dallas Mavericks that 
reportedly is worth $18 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Hurley, a five-year NBA veteran who suffered  
life-threatening injuries in a two-car accident in his rookie 
season with the Sacramento Kings, was waived by the Vancouver 
Grizzlies. The Grizzlies had acquired Hurley, a former Duke star, 
in a four-player deal with Sacramento last Feb. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phoenix Suns re-signed free agents Rex Chapman and Clifford  
Robinson along with first-round draft pick Pat Garrity and another 
first-year player, Gerald Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Garrity was selected with the 19th pick in the 1998 draft by  
Milwaukee but was later traded to Dallas and then Phoenix in a 
three-way deal. He played at Notre Dame under former Suns coach 
John McLeod. 
</P>
<P>
	The Portland Trail Blazers signed rookie guard Bonzi Wells to a  
three-year contract. Financial terms were not disclosed. Wells, 
drafted out of Ball State, was acquired from the Detroit Pistons 
last week for a conditional first-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other guards -- James Blackwell, Ernest Hall and Damian  
Owens -- were cut by Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
	Three players were cut by the Atlanta Hawks: former Georgia Tech  
star Brian Oliver; Mitch Henderson, a rookie from Princeton, and 
Jason Lawson, a reserve last season with Orlando.

<HEADLINE> Greek Orthodox Leader Denies Ouster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Rev. Robert G. Stephanopoulos, a prominent  
Greek Orthodox leader and father of former White House aide George 
Stephanopoulos, on Tuesday denied reports that he has been removed 
as head of Holy Trinity cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am still the dean of the cathedral,'' Stephanopoulos said.  
</P>
<P>
	The communications director for the Greek archdiocese, the Rev.  
Mark Arey, agreed that Stephanopoulos retains the title. However, 
he said the Rev. J. Gabriel Karambis will be assuming various 
administrative and pastoral leadership functions formerly filled by 
Stephanopoulos. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute is the latest incident in a severe feud within U.S.  
Greek Orthodoxy. Stephanopoulos said he would clarify his status 
this week at a meeting with the church's U.S. leader, Archbishop 
Spyridon. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday the National Herald, a Greek newspaper based in New  
York, reported that Stephanopoulos, the dean of the New York 
cathedral, had been ``stripped by Archbishop Spyridon of most of 
his administrative duties'' and made an ``assistant'' under 
Karambis, who had been given ``pastoral authority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arey said ``assistant'' was inaccurate.  
</P>
<P>
	Stephanopoulos had earlier joined more than 100 priests in  
signing a letter critical of Spyridon's administration. The 
archbishop tried to get rid of him to put fear in the rest of the 
clergy, according to Dean Popps, spokesman for Greek Orthodox 
American Leaders, an independent lay organization based in 
Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	GOAL has accused Spyridon of abuses of power and wants him  
removed, and Spyridon's archdiocese has filed a lawsuit against the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Popps contended that Spyridon acted against Stephanopoulos and  
two other signers after the archbishop won the backing of 
Orthodoxy's worldwide spiritual leader, Ecumenical Patriarch 
Bartholomew, at a meeting on the American split. 
</P>
<P>
	Bartholomew has direct jurisdiction over the U.S. Greek church  
and appointed Spyridon in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephanopoulos said Spyridon was only ``giving me an additional  
assignment'' supervising pastoral missions. Asked whether he 
retained authority as well as the dean's title, Stephanopoulos 
said, ``There are still questions regarding the administration of 
the cathedral and the priestly ministries,'' which remain under 
discussion with Spyridon.

<HEADLINE> Court Reinstates Hubbell Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A divided federal appeals court today  
reinstated a tax evasion case against presidential friend Webster 
Hubbell, but raised serious questions whether prosecutor Kenneth 
Starr can use Hubbell's own records to prosecute him. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that a federal judge overstepped  
his authority when he threw out the tax charges against the four 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Congress's  
independent counsel arrangements. ... It is not for lower court 
judges to undercut that decision by constructions of the Act that 
prevent this Independent Counsel from performing his duty in a 
manner reasonably approximating that of an ordinary prosecutor,'' 
the court held in two 2-1 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision means that Hubbell, who already has served one  
prison sentence, now faces two additional criminal trials involving 
Starr's office, which alleges he cheated his on taxes and 
obstructed investigators in the Whitewater investigation. The 
obstruction case was brought by Starr late last year while the 
appeal was pending in the tax case. 
</P>
<P>
	In throwing out the tax case against Hubbell, U.S. District  
Judge James Robertson said Starr should have gotten the approval of 
Attorney General Janet Reno in order to bring the charges and that 
Starr had unfairly used Hubbell's own financial records against him 
in assembling evidence against the former associate attorney 
general. Hubbell had turned over the records to Starr under a 
limited grant of immunity known as production immunity. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court validated Starr's theory of the case -- that he  
was entitled to bring the charges based on evidence that hundreds 
of thousands of dollars he was paid by friends of President Clinton 
may have been ``hush money'' to ensure his silence in Starr's 
Whitewater probe. 
</P>
<P>
	``The timing, sources, and extent of the payments make the  
belief that they were hush money reasonable,'' said the appeals 
court. That suffices to bring the charges, the court added. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court, however, questioned the extent to which Starr  
can rely on the documents he collected from Hubbell in prosecuting 
the longtime friend of the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr, said the appeals court, must establish that it knew  
before collecting the documents that they existed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless the Independent Counsel can establish its knowledge of  
the existence and possession of the documents sought in the 
subpoena with greater detail and particularity, it will have to 
live with the consequences of its decision to compel production,'' 
the appeals court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Accordingly, should the Independent Counsel prove unable to  
meet the requisite evidentiary burden, the contents of those 
documents will be inadmissible,'' the court ruled, pointing to a 
serious Fifth Amendment issue that the prosecutor must overcome if 
he is to prosecute Hubbell. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax case against Hubbell, his wife, his tax preparer and his  
tax lawyer stemmed from hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
payments to the former law partner of Hillary Rodham Clinton by 
friends of the Clintons in 1994 after he had resigned from the 
Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr began delving into the payments at a time when Hubbell was  
supposed to be cooperating with the prosecutor in his criminal 
investigation of the Clintons' Whitewater dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-count grand jury indictment charged that by late 1997,  
the alleged evasion involved taxes, interest and penalties for 
1989-1992, 1994 and 1995 exceeding $894,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell ``performed little or no work'' for the consulting fees  
he received in 1994 from friends of the president at a time when 
Hubbell was under investigation by Starr's office, Starr alleged in 
the indictment.

<HEADLINE> Elam Makes Broncs' Kicking Special </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The instant he saw wide receiver Jason Elam kick a  
football, Georgia prep coach Dave Hunter made a snap decision. Elam 
had caught his last pass. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the receivers coach to leave him alone,'' Hunter  
recalled. ``Then I told Jason, `Sit down on the bench. If you get 
up, I'll kill you.''' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Elam's senior season at Brookwood High in Snellville,  
Ga., and Hunter was in his first year as head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Elam kicked only sparingly until then, but a kicking career was  
born. He converted nine of 11 field goals that season, including 
two game-winners, one of which was a 52-yarder that remains a 
school record. 
</P>
<P>
	Elam went on to Hawaii, where, in his first college game, his  
last-minute kick upset Iowa. He became an All-American, and his 79 
field goals were just one shy of the NCAA record. 
</P>
<P>
	Drafted by the Denver Broncos in the third round in 1993, Elam's  
achievements have continued to mount. 
</P>
<P>
	Elam boasts a franchise-best .781 field-goal percentage (157 of  
201), and this season he ran his consecutive field-goal streak to a 
club-record 19 before having a kick blocked on Dec. 6. He has made 
his last 235 extra-point kicks and has made 259 of 260, the highest 
career percentage (.996) in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
	His 51-yard field goal, the second-longest in Super Bowl  
history, helped the Broncos beat Green Bay 31-24 last January. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Oct. 25, he matched the longest field goal in league  
history, booting a 63-yarder to tie the 28-year-old record set by 
Tom Dempsey. 
</P>
<P>
	Next month, he will head to his second Pro Bowl.  
</P>
<P>
	Elam credits much of his success to working on mechanics with  
kicking guru Mackey Shilstone and to a thorough visualization 
routine he performs before every game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I try to go over in my mind every possible situation that  
might happen,'' he said. ``You don't want to be surprised by 
anything. I go over different wind conditions, rain, different hash 
marks, going both directions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then I try to focus on mechanics. The adrenaline is always  
cranking. You just let it fire. If it doesn't go in, then it 
doesn't go in. But more times than not, it's going to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elam, who has kicked field goals as long as 75 yards in  
practice, said his chances of a history-making kick in the Super 
Bowl next Sunday depend on several factors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The conditions would have to be just right, at the end of the  
half or a desperation thing at the end of the game,'' he said. 
``And it depends a lot, I think, on how I kick this week in 
practice. If I'm kicking terrible in practice and falling short 
from 55, then Mike (coach Mike Shanahan) won't let me have a shot 
at it. If I'm kicking well, he will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of his season-long performance, Elam has helped raise  
the standard of the Broncos' special teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Punter Tom Rouen averaged a career-best 46.9 yards, ranking  
second in the NFL. He was selected an alternate to the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn Hebron averaged a career-high 26.4 yards on kickoff  
returns to rank third in the AFC. Against Miami on Dec. 21, he 
returned a kick 95 yards for a touchdown -- the first kickoff return 
for a TD by a Denver player since 1972.

	Darrien Gordon had punt returns of 44, 36 and 30 yards in a  
solid season, and his career punt-return average of 13.2 yards 
remains the best in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a whole, I think we've had a really good year,'' Rouen  
said. ``Jason had a phenomenal year. Vaughn did a good job of 
running back kicks, Darrien has been really solid, and I had one of 
my best years. It's been great. We've done a lot of really good 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elam also credits Rouen for being ``a great holder for me the  
last four or five years. There's a lot of components that go into 
great special teams play. We'll try to tie them all together on 
Sunday.''

<HEADLINE> Actor Gary Busey Taken Into Custody </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MALIBU, Calif. (AP) -- Actor Gary Busey was taken into custody  
for investigation of domestic violence after an argument with his 
wife escalated into a confrontation, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Busey, 54, was booked for investigation of misdemeanor spousal  
battery after his wife called authorities Monday night, sheriff's 
Deputy Joan Raber said. The actor was freed early today after 
posting $2,500 bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiana Busey had no visible injuries and was not hospitalized,  
Raber said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Busey told authorities that her husband ``grabbed her  
shoulders and wrestled her to the ground'' during an argument, 
Deputy Mark Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buseys' phone number is unlisted.  
</P>
<P>
	Busey received an Oscar nomination for the 1978 movie ``The  
Buddy Holly Story'' and also starred in ``Lethal Weapon,'' ``Point 
Break'' and ``The Firm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, a United Airlines flight attendant claimed Busey struck  
her after she bumped him. Criminal charges were not filed. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995 paramedics found the actor unconscious at his California  
home after a friend called 911 to say Busey had snorted cocaine. 
Drug charges were dropped after he enrolled in a drug 
rehabilitation program.

<HEADLINE> Record Year for Coal Projected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Coal demand will remain high for several more  
years but could dampen if electric utilities turn to cleaner fuels, 
the Commerce Department says. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, part of Commerce's annual ``U.S. Industry and Trade  
Outlook,'' said production is expected to continue rising about 1 
percent each year, reaching 1.24 billion tons in 2015. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the increase results from a ``modest though steady rise  
in coal consumption for the generation of electricity,'' the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tuesday's report said environmental factors could cloud the  
industry's long-term outlook. Carbon dioxide, a heat-trapping gas 
that many scientists say is contributing to a warming of the earth, 
is produced from burning fossil fuels, especially coal. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States agreed in worldwide negotiations in Kyoto,  
Japan, a year ago to reduce carbon emissions to below 1990 levels 
by 2008-2012. The agreement still needs Senate ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many answers will arrive in the next few years as electric  
utilities, the traditional market for steam coal in the United 
States, decide whether to invest in expensive and in some cases 
still experimental clean-coal technologies to comply with 
government air-quality regulations,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was released the same day the National Mining  
Association, an industry trade group, projected that demand for 
coal will remain strong this year, pushing past the record high of 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The group forecast that total domestic consumption and exports  
of coal will be 1.14 billion tons in 1999, a slight increase from 
the 1.131 billion tons a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Electric utilities seeking a low-cost fuel are driving much of  
the demand, the group said. Its analysis concluded that utilities 
will use 935 million tons of coal to generate 56.8 percent of 
electricity produced by public utilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``America's coal mining companies are alive and well and  
producing more coal than they have at any time in history,'' said 
Richard L. Lawson, president of the mining trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	For 1999, the National Mining Association study found that coal  
use for electricity will increase in all regions except New 
England, where some nuclear generators are returning to service 
following years of dormancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall the Midwest and the South represent areas of greatest  
growth. Production east of the Mississippi River will be slightly 
higher than in the West, according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of weak economies abroad, exports are projected to  
continue a decline that began in 1995. The report estimates that 
exports will total 76 million tons, down slightly from 78 million 
in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Coal use in coking operations is estimated to remain at 28  
million tons, while industrial and retail coal consumption is 
expected to drop to 74 million tons, from 76 million in 1998, 
because of low natural gas and oil prices.

<HEADLINE> Chaplain Tries To Inspire Senators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Throughout the impeachment trial, the job of  
inspiring a roomful of senators growing wearier by the day rests 
heavily on the shoulders of the Rev. Lloyd John Ogilvie, the Senate 
chaplain. 
</P>
<P>
	As the trial entered its third week Monday, Ogilvie renewed his  
calls for divine intervention to guide the world's most famous 
deliberative body. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dear God,'' he began. ``We hear your promise sounding in our  
souls, 'Be not afraid, I am with you.' We place our trust in your 
problem-solving power, your conflict-resolving presence and your 
anxiety-dissolving peace. 
</P>
<P>
	``So we report in to you for duty,'' Ogilvie said.  
</P>
<P>
	The prayers at the start of each day's session are mindful of  
the promise made by the senators to do ``impartial justice'' in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Grant the senators the ability to exercise clear judgment  
without judgmentalism,'' Ogilvie prayed Jan. 7, the day they were 
sworn in for the trial. He also asked the Lord to unite the chamber 
in ``nonpartisan commitment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ogilvie, a Presbyterian minister, also has observed that the  
senators' job of sitting silent and listening for hours on end is 
hard work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Often it is difficult to hear what is being said because of  
differing convictions,'' he prayed last week. ``Grant them renewed 
energy, sensitive audio nerves and discerning minds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Comparing the House impeachment prosecutors to gamblers facing  
long odds, David Kendall, President Clinton's personal attorney, 
sharply attacked their request for the Senate to vote to bring 
witnesses in for testimony. He said prosecutors should have called 
witnesses when the case was before the House. 
</P>
<P>
	``They failed to do that, I submit, and they're a little like a  
blackjack player who sees 20 on the table and has 19 and is going 
to try to draw that two, hoping against the odds,'' Kendall argued 
Tuesday. ``They're simply gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	``And gambling may have its place as a recreation,'' he  
continued. ``I think it has no place in the impeachment trial here 
when the fate of the president is at stake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., one of 13 House Judiciary Committee  
members arguing for Clinton's removal from office, later fired 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, another part of poker is bluffs, and I don't know  
whether they're bluffing,'' he said of the Clinton defense team. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	While Clinton was in St. Louis seeking spiritual uplift from an  
appearance with Pope John Paul II, religious leaders gathered on 
Capitol Hill to ask Congress for a little more temporal civility. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have arrived at a critical moment in the life of our  
nation,'' the Rev. C. Welton Gaddy of the Interfaith Alliance 
Foundation said at a symposium attended by some 100 faith leaders 
and congressional staff members. 
</P>
<P>
	``A frightening degree of incivility'' has surfaced with the  
impeachment and Senate trial of Clinton, he said. ``We have to 
learn how to differ from each other without destroying each 
other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation, a group of religious moderates and liberals  
formed in 1995, plans to hold conferences in 10 cities around the 
country to urge greater civility in public discourse and warn 
against what Gaddy called ``the politicization of faith and the 
religiofication of politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	As Republicans met behind closed doors in an attempt to settle  
the question of whether witnesses should be called to testify, Sen. 
Bob Smith, R-N.H., a possible presidential candidate, took time out 
to have his picture taken. 
</P>
<P>
	Archbishop Costodio Alvim Pereira, a Vatican official who was in  
Washington for an anti-abortion demonstration, appeared in a 
Capitol hallway near where Republican senators were debating the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	He was there to visit Smith, who stepped outside of the caucus  
room so his photograph could be taken with the archbishop.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Olympics Preparing Response </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Atlanta's Olympic organizers scurried Tuesday to  
tell the IOC if there were improprieties during their winning bid 
for the 1996 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Olympic Committee is investigating a bribery  
scandal that began last month with Salt Lake City and has since 
broadened in scope. IOC vice president Dick Pound, who is in charge 
of the investigation, wants to look at the bids of all cities 
dating back to the 1996 Games at an emergency meeting in Lausanne, 
Switzerland, March 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of, once again, `rack your brain, rack your  
brain,''' former Atlanta Olympics chief Billy Payne said. ``We're 
not getting together in a room or anything, but we're all glad for 
the chance to respond in this formal way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payne and others involved with the Atlanta bid have continuously  
denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our bid would stand a pretty rigorous scrutiny by the  
rules that existed at time,'' said A.D. Frazier, former chief 
operating officer of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games. 
``Not only that, but we had six years from 1991 of clean audits by 
Price-Waterhouse. And the AOC (the Atlanta Olympic Committee, which 
handled the bid) had a clean audit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in Salt Lake gave cash, college scholarships, free  
medical care and lavish gifts to IOC members and their families 
while winning the 2002 Winter Games, an IOC inquiry found. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic officials in Sydney, host of the 2000 Summer Games, said  
they offered $70,000 in inducements to two African IOC members on 
the eve of their vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Six IOC members have already been expelled over the Salt Lake  
scandal, and another three have resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Atlanta officials nor the U.S. Olympic Committee have  
received an official request for information about the Atlanta 
Games, even though a draft letter was circulated at the IOC meeting 
last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would expect the questions would be fairly simple, such as  
were there members who made multiple visits, asked anything out of 
the ordinary, or did we give gifts out of ordinary,'' said ACOG's 
former communications chief, Dick Yarborough. ``We're doing this 
through institutional knowledge and talking it out amongst 
ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The request for Atlanta information is supposed to go through  
the USOC, but executive director Dick Schultz said Atlanta probably 
would be asked to provide answers directly. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not trying to make Atlanta look bad,'' Schultz said.  
``This is more of an internal thing inside the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the state radio station in the Republic of Congo  
reported that former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young traveled to 
Brazzaville in 1984 to promote Atlanta's bid. According to the 
report, Young promised to build a sports stadium in the capital in 
exchange for the country's support for Atlanta's campaign to host 
the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The republic's IOC representative, Jean-Claude Ganga, was one of  
those expelled. Pound's report said Ganga received more than 
$216,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne said he didn't even get the idea to pursue the Olympics  
until 1987, three years after the alleged promise by Young. The 
USOC chose Atlanta as the American bid city in 1988 and the IOC 
picked the Georgia capital in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Young may have been in the Congo in 1984 ... but that  
report is clearly false,'' Young spokesman Lee Echols said. ``Andy 
Young never made promises to build facilities nor to provide aid to 
build facilities in relation to the Atlanta Olympic bid.''

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Trial Excerpts-2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	``The able House managers have kept insisting on their need for  
witnesses, but they haven't indicated what substantial material and 
relevant questions the witnesses would be asked which haven't 
already been asked or why such questions are essential or even 
relevant to the resolution of this proceeding. Frankly, I think 
this is because there just aren't that many more questions to ask 
of these witnesses.'' -- David Kendall, presidential attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``How can you have a trial, they protest, without witnesses? One  
might ask: How can you have a hearing without witnesses? But the 
House did. How can you impeach a president without witnesses? Well, 
the House showed us.'' -- Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``They did not tell their colleagues 'we won't need witnesses in  
the House because we'll have them in the Senate.' Nope, they rushed 
this through the House because they had the votes. And now they 
want to delay in the Senate because they're afraid they don't have 
the votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no reason, we respectfully submit, to delay in this  
chamber; to drag out these proceedings and defer doing the business 
of the American people.'' -- Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no material reason to call Mr. Blumenthal except to  
try to embarrass the president by the presentation of testimony 
from a member of his senior staff.'' -- Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Should the Senate decide to authorize the House managers to  
call additional witnesses, live in this proceeding or have their 
depositions taken, we will be faced with a critical need for the 
discovery of evidence useful to our defense.'' -- Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me conclude by saying that I don't think, and I  
respectfully submit to you, that there is a need to prolong this 
process. We hope that you will render your decision in a manner 
that is speedy, and we're confident that you'll decide, you'll make 
that decision in a manner that is fair. And this body will, as so 
often it's done in past times of crisis, be able to bring to the 
country both the closure and reconciliation that the country wants 
so very much.'' -- Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Members of this body, it is the job of the House of  
Representatives, it is the constitutional obligation of the House 
of Representatives, to act as the accusatory body in an impeachment 
proceeding. The Constitution gives the authority to this body the 
right to try that case. This is the place for trial. This is the 
place to determine guilt. This is the place to determine 
credibility. This is the place for witnesses.'' -- Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``It is disturbing, it's annoying, it's irritating when I hear  
that the counsel for the president had been cut off from 
information and data; we've sequestered things on them. I pleaded 
with them to produce witnesses, made the subpoenas available to 
them. They have a positive allergy to fact witnesses.'' -- Rep. 
Henry Hyde, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Their defense has never been on the facts. If they can come up  
with a good fact witness that has something to say, we will see a 
reenactment of the Indian rope trick, it seems to me. We will see 
professors, though, if past is prologue. I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
	But the threat of -- the threat of prolonged hearings, I supposed  
is supposed to make you tremble. It doesn't to me, but then 
different things -- different strokes, I guess, for different folks. 
But their defense has been to demonize Mr. Starr to a 
fare-thee-well, and to yell about the process. That has been their 
defense. And I'll be frank with you, I'm not sure I could stand a 
lot more of that, but that's what they will do.'' -- Hyde. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``They complained that we called no witnesses in the House. Now  
they're complaining that we're calling witnesses in the Senate, as 
though they don't understand the difference in the threshold.'' --

<HEADLINE> Parcells To Skip Coaching Pro Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- New York Jets coach Bill Parcells has  
been excused from coaching the AFC team in the Pro Bowl for medical 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells, who never has coached in the game and begged off  
working the Senior Bowl last year, received permission from NFL 
commissioner Paul Tagliabue on Tuesday to skip the all-star game on 
Feb. 7 in Honolulu. Parcells underwent a series of medical tests 
last week and two doctors who examined him said he should not work 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach Parcells was examined by his cardiologist, as well as by  
me in my office a couple of days after the Denver game,'' Jets 
medical director Elliott Pellman said, referring to the 23-10 loss 
for the AFC championship on Jan. 17. ``He clearly was showing the 
physical effects of the long season. Given his medical history, I 
told him that he should not travel to Hawaii and participate in the 
Pro Bowl. He will remain under my care for the forseeable future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells left coaching in 1991, quitting the New York Giants  
because of health problems. He has undergone several heart 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in the midst of preparation for the Pro Bowl with my  
staff and fully planned to carry out my obligation under the NFL 
guidelines,'' Parcells said. ``But after undergoing a thorough 
medical examination, I feel it would be a big mistake on my part 
not to listen to the doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have nothing but respect for the Pro Bowl and the great  
players who are in it. Frankly, I'll miss being around them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his place, assistant head coach Bill Belichick will run the  
AFC team, along with the entire Jets coaching staff. Minnesota's 
Dennis Green will coach the NFC.

<HEADLINE> Rolling Stones' Ticket Prices High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Fans hoping for a front-row seat at the  
Rolling Stones concert next month are stuck between a rock and a 
hard place: Those tickets are going for more than $250. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the Twin Cities' highest ticket price ever for a rock  
concert. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stones were charging as much as $151.25 for the best seats  
for their Feb. 15 concert at Target Center. Those tickets quickly 
sold out. 
</P>
<P>
	So concert promoter Jam Productions released a new block of  
tickets Tuesday for seats even closer to the stage -- for a top 
price of $251.25 before service charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The promoter said the seats can be made available because the  
stage the Stones are using on their ``No Security'' Tour will allow 
for 360-degree views.

<HEADLINE> War Tales at Impeachment Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The blood-stained beaches of Normandy. The  
costly island-hopping campaign of the Pacific. The fearful years as 
a prisoner in North Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	The subject before the Senate was the removal of a president,  
but a visitor could not be blamed for thinking it was an emotional 
seminar on war and the sacrifices of battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do we keep faith with them?'' asked Rep. Henry Hyde,  
R-Ill., alluding to the American soldiers who have fallen in 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We work to make this the country the kind of America they were  
willing to die for,'' continued Hyde, leader of the House team of 
prosecutors in the trial of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the Senate aisle, White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff  
might have wondered about the relevance of war to the impeachment 
trial in progress. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm never certain how to respond when an advocate on the other  
side of a case calls up images of patriots over the centuries who 
have sacrificed themselves to preserve our democracy,'' Ruff 
remarked. 
</P>
<P>
	But then he, too, used a war story to make his points.  
</P>
<P>
	No World War II soldier -- not even his father who fought on  
Omaha Beach in 1944 -- went into battle to fight for one side or the 
other in an impeachment of a president, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He fought as all those did for our country and our  
Constitution. ... and as long as each of us -- manager, president's 
counsel, senator -- does his or her constitutional duty, those who 
fought for their country will be proud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defense's closing argument also referred to war.  
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., invited senators to ask their  
war hero-colleagues -- Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii; Bob Kerrey, D-Neb.; 
John Chafee, R-R.I.; and John McCain, R-Ariz. -- what the fighting 
was all about. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested their answers would be different. ``You don't have  
to guess,'' the just-retired Bumpers said. ``They're with us, and 
they're living. And they can tell you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kerrey lost part of his right leg in Vietnam, earning the Medal  
of Honor, the nation's highest military honor. Inouye was severely 
wounded in World War II and lost an arm. McCain, the son and 
grandson of renowned Navy admirals, spent seven years as a prisoner 
of war after his Navy fighter was shot down over Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	Some observers outside of the nation's capital considered it  
inappropriate to link war and impeachment. But others said the 
individuals presenting the case for Clinton's removal should not be 
faulted for pulling out all the stops in their role as prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde, for example, tugged at Senate heart strings with the  
emotional tale of his 1994 visit to Normandy on the 50th 
anniversary of the Allies' amphibious landing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The use of the metaphor of war in this context and in that  
service is fair game,'' said Frank Gaffney Jr., director of the 
Center for Security Policy and a former assistant secretary of 
defense in the Reagan administration. 
</P>
<P>
	But John Mueller, political science professor at the University  
of Rochester in upstate New York, said the debate should really be 
about the Constitution. He called the link between war and 
impeachment ``an astounding stretch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The emotional thing can be sort of insulting,'' said Mueller,  
who studies presidents and warfare. ``People don't like their 
emotions toyed with in any case. Sometimes it works, of course, but 
you have to be careful about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bert Rockman, who teaches the presidency at the University of  
Pittsburgh, dismissed the prosecutorial tactic as ``an overreach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody likes to wrap themselves up in the flag,'' said  
Rockman, who is writing a book on Clinton's legacy. ``It's just one 
more excess in a year full of them.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Accused of `Smothering' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government accused a senior Microsoft  
executive Tuesday of promising to ``smother'' rival Netscape by 
discouraging others from distributing its software and trying 
illegally to drive down its stock price. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were trying to compete with them in every way we could,''  
answered Paul Maritz, the highest-ranking Microsoft executive 
expected to testify in the company's antitrust trial. ``If that had 
an effect on them, it was an inevitable consequence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dramatic courtroom exchanges Tuesday marked an abrupt turn  
from the recent dry testimony of economists from both sides who 
focused on legal distinctions of monopoly power, profits and price 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer David Boies confronted the executive  
over Microsoft's efforts to win the lucrative Internet software 
business once dominated by Netscape Communications Corp. Boies 
sometimes grabbed his lectern Tuesday and leaned toward Maritz in 
his most aggressive questioning in more than 12 weeks of trial. 
</P>
<P>
	But Maritz rarely gave an inch, frequently offering calm but  
lengthy responses and entirely different interpretations of e-mails 
the government is using as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, after a long reply, the government's lawyer asked:  
``Do you know what question you're answering, sir?'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the day's end, even U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield  
Jackson appeared frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
	``This witness is awfully difficult to get an answer from,'' the  
judge remarked to Microsoft lawyer John Warden. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the witness has been awfully forthcoming,'' Warden  
shot back. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its antitrust case, the government accuses Microsoft  
of trying to ``crush'' Netscape after it rejected an illegal offer 
to divide the market for Internet browser software during a 
disputed June 1995 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	It contends Microsoft later distributed its browser free with  
newer versions of its Windows operating system to undermine 
Netscape's popular software and deprive its rival of income. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies showed Maritz sworn testimony from Intel Corp. executives,  
who said Maritz pledged to ``embrace and smother'' rival Netscape 
during a November 1995 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm testifying that I have no recollection of saying that,''  
Maritz said. ``In the absence of a tape recording, I can't prove I 
never said that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boies also showed Maritz a May 1996 letter from Microsoft  
Chairman Bill Gates, titled ``Some thoughts on Netscape.'' In the 
document, Gates wrote: ``At some point, financial-minded analysts 
will begin to consider how much of a revenue stream Netscape will 
be able to generate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz answered, ``If we do our job, we'd be presenting  
competition for Netscape. That would be one issue financial 
analysts would take into account.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boies pressed Maritz about his company's intentions during the  
disputed 1995 meeting with Netscape. He confronted the witness with 
e-mail describing plans to ``co-opt Netscape'' and to ``move 
Netscape out of the (Windows browser) arena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Maritz asserted that Microsoft wanted Netscape to adopt some  
of its technology into Netscape's own browser, such as methods for 
protecting credit-card sales or viewing documents and spreadsheets 
across the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were trying to see if there was some common ground with  
Netscape,'' Maritz testified. ``We saw an opportunity for Netscape 
to build their (browser) with various platform technologies we were 
providing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz denied that Microsoft offered to avoid competing with  
Netscape. But after Boies asked several times in several ways, 
Maritz acknowledged that Microsoft's offer was largely 
unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's about as well as you're going to do,'' the  
judge told Boies. 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz defended Microsoft's software contracts as ``normal  
marketing activities, normal joint-marketing arrangements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In certain specific circumstances, we did conclude marketing  
agreements where partners gave preference to our product over 
competing products,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Leavitt Says Utah Hurt by Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Gov. Mike Leavitt called for the  
International Olympic Committee to ``step up'' and ensure the 2002 
Winter Games are successful, but remained confident that Salt Lake 
City will prove it's the best host for the games. 
</P>
<P>
	He said IOC officials should expect fewer perks and make other  
concessions if corporate sponsors are scared away by the corruption 
scandal. Hid not say, as some have, that the IOC should pay for any 
shortfalls in Olympic fundraising. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the money will come,'' Leavitt said. ``In my  
discussions with corporate sponsors there is still very large 
support based on the way we've reacted and responded. If the money 
does not materialize we do have other options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt said that when he approved the Salt Lake Organizing  
Committee budget last fall, he required there be a contingency plan 
for running the games on $100 million less than budgeted. 
</P>
<P>
	He discredited a push by some Utah citizen groups to return the  
Olympic bid, and said he believes there is a ``deeper resolve'' 
than ever to stage a successful games to showcase Utah values to 
the world and redeem the state's image. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes no sense at all for us to even consider at this point  
backing out,'' he said. ``We were the best city in the world. We 
still are.''

<P>
	No one is going to replace Michael Jordan on the Chicago Bulls.  
Brent Barry knows he's merely filling MJ's spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry, the former NBA slam dunk champion and son of Hall of  
Famer Rick Barry, signed a six-year, $27 million contract Monday 
with the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	The free agent will take over the shooting guard role left by  
Jordan's retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no fun to be part of the cleanup crew, but hopefully that  
will only last a year or two and you get back to where the team was 
before,'' Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry liked the reports he heard on new coach Tim Floyd, and  
that convinced him to sign with the decimated NBA champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm silly to come here, but he is crazy to be coaching here,''  
Barry said. ``That's the way I look at it. Any guy that crazy I 
want to play for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barry averaged 9.6 points per game in three seasons with the Los  
Angeles Clippers and Miami Heat. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he does play well in Chicago, then they think they've got  
the next Michael Jordan,'' Miami coach Pat Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Clippers got good news when they learned Michael  
Olowokandi, the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft from Pacific 
University, was released from his contract with Kinder Bologna of 
the Italian League. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7-foot-1 center had signed with Kinder about 24 hours before  
the NBA and its players agreed recently to end the owners' lockout. 
Olowokandi's deal with Kinder bound him to the club until Feb. 15, 
but the team reportedly decided to release him and save money 
because he had averaged only 7.7 points and 5.6 rebounds in six 
games in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a surprise to me,'' Clippers vice president of  
basketball operations Elgin Baylor said. ``I'm sure it's probably a 
surprise to him, too, that they let him out of his contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor expects Olowokandi to join the team Wednesday night in  
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Steve Nash, acquired in a draft-day trade from Phoenix,  
signed a six-year contract extension with the Dallas Mavericks that 
reportedly is worth $18 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Hurley, a five-year NBA veteran who suffered  
life-threatening injuries in a two-car accident in his rookie 
season with the Sacramento Kings, was waived by the Vancouver 
Grizzlies. The Grizzlies had acquired Hurley, a former Duke star, 
in a four-player deal with Sacramento last Feb. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phoenix Suns re-signed free agents Rex Chapman and Clifford  
Robinson along with first-round draft pick Pat Garrity and another 
first-year player, Gerald Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Garrity was selected with the 19th pick in the 1998 draft by  
Milwaukee but was later traded to Dallas and then Phoenix in a 
three-way deal. He played at Notre Dame under former Suns coach 
John McLeod. 
</P>
<P>
	The Portland Trail Blazers signed rookie guard Bonzi Wells to a  
three-year contract. Financial terms were not disclosed. Wells, 
drafted out of Ball State, was acquired from the Detroit Pistons 
last week for a conditional first-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other guards -- James Blackwell, Ernest Hall and Damian  
Owens -- were cut by Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
	Three players were cut by the Atlanta Hawks: former Georgia Tech  
star Brian Oliver; Mitch Henderson, a rookie from Princeton, and 
Jason Lawson, a reserve last season with Orlando.

<HEADLINE>  Iverson Gets $70.9M From Sixers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Allen Iverson is constantly criticized for  
hanging with the wrong crowd. He's loyal and generous to a fault, 
and won't renounce his roots no matter how many millions he makes. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, he got advice from the right people.  
</P>
<P>
	Passing up a chance at more money in the open market, Iverson  
signed a six-year, $70.9 million contract extension with the 
Philadelphia 76ers on Tuesday. A final push from his mom and former 
Georgetown coach John Thompson convinced him he was doing the right 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took their best player and they didn't get into the game  
of a negotiation,'' said Iverson's agent, David Falk. ``Allen 
reciprocated and said, `Thanks. I want to be here, and enough's 
enough.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson lost his chance at a $100 million mega-contract with the  
NBA's new collective bargaining agreement. But he chose not to wait 
until July 1, when he could have negotiated a seven-year deal with 
any team for more than $86 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to show them he wanted to be here,'' Falk said.  
``There was no need to sit around and try to make the contract look 
bigger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson got a big raise and all the pressure that comes with it.  
Sixers president Pat Croce has put his championship hopes on the 
shoulders of a 23-year-old who's still learning -- on the court and 
off. Among other legal problems, Iverson is still on probation for 
a 1997 drug and weapons arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	He has amassed a formidable list of indiscretions since entering  
the league as the No. 1 draft pick in 1996, but Croce believes he's 
finally ready to be an adult. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was on the street, although definitely not the same street  
as him,'' Croce said. ``I can relate. I see a stone-cold winner in 
him that really has a big heart. Sometimes his heart gets the best 
of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, this is Iverson's team now. The next few years could  
make it his city, or even his NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to win the most championships,'' Iverson said. ``And I  
want to be the best player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson will get the maximum for a player entering his third  
season in the league, Croce said. He will get $9 million next 
season with annual raises of $1.1 million that add up to $14.6 
million in the final year of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to wait until the end of the year and then  
decide whether to play for a contender,'' Iverson said. ``I never 
wanted to take the easy way out. I've been here through the bad 
times, I want to be here through the good. I pretty much knew what 
time it was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falk said Iverson wanted to stay with the Sixers all along, but  
sought counsel from Thompson and his mother before finalizing his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Allen wanted to be here,'' Falk said.  
</P>
<P>
	Iverson's 1998-99 salary of $3.5 million is prorated for a  
50-game schedule, reducing it to $2.2 million -- a loss of more than 
$1.3 million due to the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to make enough money to take care of my  
family,'' Iverson said. ``The money that's out there for me right 
now is enough for me to do so. If the Sixers were going to give me 
$100 million, I would be a fool not to take it. I have a family and 
I want to know how my future's going to look financially. But it's 
not all about money all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, legal problems haunted Iverson again.  
Mercedes-Benz Credit Corp. sued Iverson in a dispute over unpaid 
lease payments on three late-model cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Falk said Iverson's lawyers were ``putting the final wrinkles on  
that.'' Though Croce was willing to let his championship hopes rest 
with Iverson, he still worries about him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's young, and I know he's giving of himself and of his  
riches to his friends and family to a fault,'' Croce said. ``So I 
always worry about him, because he's not someone who will say no.''

as him,'' Croce said. ``I can relate. I see a stone-cold winner in 
him that really has a big heart. Sometimes his heart gets the best 
of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, this is Iverson's team now. The next few years could  
make it his city, or even his NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to win the most championships,'' Iverson said. ``And I  
want to be the best player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson will get the maximum for a player entering his third  
season in the league, Croce said. He will get $9 million next 
season with annual raises of $1.1 million that add up to $14.6 
million in the final year of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to wait until the end of the year and then  
decide whether to play for a contender,'' Iverson said. ``I never 
wanted to take the easy way out. I've been here through the bad 
times, I want to be here through the good. I pretty much knew what 
time it was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falk said Iverson wanted to stay with the Sixers all along, but  
sought counsel from Thompson and his mother before finalizing his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Allen wanted to be here,'' Falk said.  
</P>
<P>
	Iverson's 1998-99 salary of $3.5 million is prorated for a  
50-game schedule, reducing it to $2.2 million -- a loss of more than 
$1.3 million due to the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to make enough money to take care of my  
family,'' Iverson said. ``The money that's out there for me right 
now is enough for me to do so. If the Sixers were going to give me 
$100 million, I would be a fool not to take it. I have a family and 
I want to know how my future's going to look financially. But it's 
not all about money all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, legal problems haunted Iverson again.  
Mercedes-Benz Credit Corp. sued Iverson in a dispute over unpaid 
lease payments on three late-model cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Falk said Iverson's lawyers were ``putting the final wrinkles on  
that.'' Though Croce was willing to let his championship hopes rest 
with Iverson, he still worries about him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's young, and I know he's giving of himself and of his  
riches to his friends and family to a fault,'' Croce said. ``So I 
always worry about him, because he's not someone who will say no.''

<HEADLINE> One-Liners Prevail at Media Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- At some other time, in some other place, what  
happened Tuesday morning at Pro Player Stadium would be called 
stalking. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the National Football League calls it ``Media Day,'' an  
annual event that involves turning hundreds of sports writers, 
assorted TV personalities and cameramen loose on the Super 
Bowl-contending teams like they were entrees at a postgame buffet. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, the only difference is that this feeding frenzy comes  
with a time limit. 
</P>
<P>
	At 8:45 a.m. Tuesday, the scoreboard clock at Pro Player was set  
to 60 minutes to count down the first interview session with the 
Atlanta Falcons. After a break of 45 minutes, it was reset to give 
equal time to the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	In between, reporters were treated to a real buffet in a stadium  
concourse a few levels up -- probably to discourage any Tyson-like 
snacking when they returned to the playing field. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, it was hard to say who enjoyed the morning less -- the  
predators, the prey, or the two dozen former football players who 
used to be part of the meal and are now part of the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing emerged as monumentally stupid as the 1988 session, when  
a reporter actually asked Washington's Doug Williams how long he 
had been a black quarterback. Or in 1981, when another reporter, 
overplaying the human-interest angle, asked Oakland's Jim Plunkett 
whether his mother was dead and his father was blind -- or vice 
versa. 
</P>
<P>
	That is not to say, however, that Tuesday was totally devoid of  
silliness. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's Ray Buchanan showed up wearing a black leather,  
silver-studded dog collar he bought for his Rottweiler, named Tyson 
because ``he bites ears.'' The Falcons cornerback picked it up at a 
local pet shop, he explained, and decided to wear it during 
interviews so he would look like the ``7-point underdog'' the 
sports books in Vegas have made Atlanta heading into Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	That explanation, though, didn't satisfy a reporter from Comedy  
Central. 
</P>
<P>
	She looked at Buchanan and asked, ``Are you housebroken?''  
</P>
<P>
	This is Atlanta's first-ever Super Bowl, and from a ``Media  
Day'' standpoint, it showed. Besides Buchanan, the only Falcon who 
generated any buzz was running back Jamal Anderson, who promised to 
replace the ``Dirty Bird'' dance with a new routine -- provided he 
gets into the end zone Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	This is how Anderson knew it was time for a change: ``Some guy  
came up to me in a bathroom and asks me to the do the `Dirty Bird.' 
I said, `Whoa, buddy! Get me security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oxygen, though, would have proven more useful to Denver receiver  
Shannon Sharpe. The mouthiest Bronco talked so much during his 
appointed hour that the humid Miami air around him actually grew 
thin. 
</P>
<P>
	A reporter began, ``Since you're known as loquacious ...'' but  
couldn't get the rest of the words out before Sharpe stepped in 
front and intercepted the question. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does that mean talkative?'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Assured that it did, Sharpe took another deep breath and dove  
back in. The next question was whether he would engage in a war of 
words with Falcons safety Eugene Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't want to get into jawing with me,'' Sharpe said.  
``He can't win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And so naturally, when another reporter pointed out that  
Robinson was a Colgate graduate who might be more skilled at 
talking smack than Sharpe suspected, he was ready for that one, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't go to Harvard,'' Sharpe said, ``but I can count to a  
million.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fortunately, he didn't. But Sharpe removed any doubts about his  
math skills a few minutes later. Asked how he thought the rooting 
interest would break down come Sunday's kickoff, Sharpe replied: 
``We've got 17,500 tickets and they've got 17,500 tickets. That 
leaves 40,000 for the locals and such. And most of them will be so 
drunk by then they won't care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Occupying the podium to Sharpe's right was Rod Smith, another  
Denver receiver who unabashedly admits that he models his every 
move -- off the field as well as on -- after Sharpe. No one had the 
nerve to ask why. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shannon is known worldwide,'' Smith said. ``And he's got some  
good plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we talk about retirement, he says the plan is to do  
nothing. And the way my accountant set it up, if I can just stay in 
this game for 30 more months at my current pay level, I'm set.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Someone pointed out that three years down the road, the  
28-year-old Smith might find retirement boring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unh-uh,'' he said, ``I'm really a regular guy. I just have a  
famous job.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Met Revives 'Simon Boccanegra' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Simon Boccanegra'' is that rare Verdi opera  
where the baritone gets the big death scene while the soprano and 
tenor survive and get each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Luckily, the Metropolitan Opera had a fine new baritone on hand  
for the title role Monday night when it revived the opera, one of 
Verdi's most musically rewarding but dramatically muddled works. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexandru Agache, a Romanian who has sung to great acclaim for  
the past decade in Europe, made an overdue house debut as the 
doleful doge of Genoa. 
</P>
<P>
	Agache has an imposing voice that filled the Met with a warm,  
well-focused sound, only occasionally sounding as if pressed to his 
limit. He brought the requisite eloquence to his famous plea for 
peace to the raging factions in the Council scene (``Plebe! 
Patrizi!). 
</P>
<P>
	His encounter with his long-lost child, Amelia -- one of Verdi's  
most tender father-daughter duets -- was less effective, with a 
slightly strained final high note on the word ``Figlia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the problem in that scene was some unsteadiness on the  
part of soprano Karita Mattila, who nearly tripped during her 
entrance down a flight of stairs and took awhile to recover. In 
later scenes, however, she sounded radiant. 
</P>
<P>
	The tenor, who definitely gets third billing in this opera, was  
Placido Domingo, the only holdover from four years ago when this 
handsome production by Giancarlo del Monaco was new. 
</P>
<P>
	Domingo remains at age 57 a marvel, still able to caress a  
phrase or soar heroically over an ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
	The other major roles in the opera are for Boccanegra's  
dark-voiced enemies. Robert Scandiuzzi made effective use of his 
cavernous bass as the patrician Fiesco; baritone Haijing Fu as the 
plebian Paolo frequently sounded out of his depth. 
</P>
<P>
	James Levine conducted a chorus and orchestra that sounded  
surprisingly out of synch at times, as if perhaps a bit 
underrehearsed.

<HEADLINE> As Good As It Gets Is Duval's 59  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Al Geiberger will always be known as ``Mr. 59'' because he was  
the first. Chip Beck has been an afterthought as the second player 
to hit golf's magic number, and he'll probably fall even further 
from memory. So where does this leave David Duval? 
</P>
<P>
	He may have to settle for perhaps the best round of golf ever  
played. 
</P>
<P>
	OK, so it was the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic and not the U.S.  
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval won't get any degree-of-difficulty points for his 59, the  
lowest score recorded in the final round of a PGA Tour event. Never 
mind that he was firing at Sunday pins cut a little tighter with a 
tournament on the line. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arnold Palmer-designed PGA West is hardly a carbon copy of  
Oakmont or Oakland Hills. Did anyone hear Duval say after signing 
for his 59, ``I'm glad I brought this course, this monster, to its 
knees?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Best round ever?  
</P>
<P>
	That seems to apply more to the 63 Johnny Miller laid down at  
Oakmont to win the 1973 U.S. Open, or Ben Hogan's 67 in the final 
round of the 1951 U.S. Open at Oakland Hills, where only one other 
player broke par 70 the entire week. 
</P>
<P>
	What about Arnold Palmer's 65 at Cherry Hills to win the 1960  
U.S. Open? Jack Nicklaus and his back-nine 30 at Augusta in 1986? 
Greg Norman's 64 at wind-swept Royal St. George to win the 1993 
British Open? David Graham at Merion in the 1981 U.S. Open? 
</P>
<P>
	What separates Duval from that short list of great rounds is  
obvious: The Hope is not a major. 
</P>
<P>
	What distinguishes Duval from that group is the number: 59.  
</P>
<P>
	And compared to the other two 59s recorded in PGA Tour history,  
this was a masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like pitching a perfect game,'' Duval said, only this was  
rarer -- there have been 13 perfect games. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval didn't make every putt. He didn't hit every green.  
</P>
<P>
	Still, he had a putt for birdie or eagle on 17 holes, and only  
four times were those putts longer than 10 feet. It was a brilliant 
display of irons, which might be Duval's strength except that he 
has no apparent weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	The back nine was a mesmerizing performance by the best player  
in the world -- the slight turn of his head at contact, eyes hidden 
behind wraparound sunglasses, locked in on the ball, eventually the 
flag stick. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes his 59 different from the others?  
</P>
<P>
	Geiberger shot his 59 in the second round of the 1977 Memphis  
Classic. Colonial Country Club was a much tougher track than PGA 
West, but stormy weather that week brought into play the ``lift, 
clean and place'' rule, always an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Geiberger started his round with a 40-foot birdie putt -- Duval's  
11 birdies and one eagle measured a combined 52 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	After making the turn, Geiberger holed a 30-yard pitching wedge  
for eagle, added two more birdies from the 18- to 20-foot range, 
then became the first PGA Tour player to break 60 with a 10-foot 
birdie on the last hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have any 2- and 3-footers,'' he recalled.  
</P>
<P>
	Beck had one of those, on the final hole of his 59 in the third  
round of the 1991 Las Vegas Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the Hope, that was a 90-hole event played in the desert,  
where low scores are the norm. That's where the comparisons ends. 
</P>
<P>
	The Las Vegas Invitational used a new course that year called  
Sunrise Golf Club, relatively short at 6,914 yards and designed by 
Jim Colbert. Robert Gamez predicted that week that someone would 
shoot 59. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be a little short for these guys,'' Colbert said in the  
days leading up to the tournament. ``It was built for the members 
to play and enjoy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beck enjoyed it, all right.  
</P>
<P>
	He drained a 40-footer for birdie on his first hole, No. 10, had  
two other putts of 20 feet and then broke 60 with an 8-iron to 
about 3 feet on the last hole. 
</P>
<P>
	The books will show the same number for all three. Geiberger  
found some measure of solace as he watched Duval stand over a 
6-foot eagle putt on the last hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least I know he's not going to shoot 58,'' Geiberger said.  
</P>
<P>
	Beck missed the cut at the Hope and was eating dinner Sunday  
night in Chicago when he heard the news. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, I wish he had broken the record and shot 58,'' he  
told Golfweek. ``I think it will happen soon, and I hope it does. 
That's the next level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether that next level becomes the best round ever played  
depends on whether the player -- maybe Duval -- can come as close to 
perfect as golf can get.

<HEADLINE> Lewis Ready To Call Packers' Plays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Sherm Lewis didn't get the title he coveted, but he will get the  
responsibilities he's never had. 
</P>
<P>
	After failing again to land an NFL head coaching job, Lewis is  
returning to Green Bay to serve as Ray Rhodes' offensive 
coordinator. He'll be in charge of calling plays for the first time 
in his 17-year career as an NFL assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to it. It's a big challenge to get this  
offense back to the Super Bowl,'' said Lewis, passed up for the 
Chicago Bears' head coaching job last weekend, the last of nine 
openings in the league. ``I've got more responsibility now, so I'm 
excited. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody says that's why I can't get a head-coaching job,  
that I've never called the plays, so this will eliminate that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others contend Lewis, who is black, is a victim of racial  
prejudice in the hiring process. Last month, defensive end Reggie 
White said: ``If Sherm Lewis were white, he'd be a head coach by 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis has been to five Super Bowls as an assistant, three with  
San Francisco and two with Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	During the past 16 seasons, his teams have compiled a 183-76-1  
record, a winning percentage of .705. He knows the complex West 
Coast offense as well as anybody. He's coached Jerry Rice, Joe 
Montana and Brett Favre. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've served a hell of an apprenticeship,'' Lewis said.  
</P>
<P>
	But he remains an assistant, at least for another year.  
</P>
<P>
	Former Packers coach Mike Holmgren, who brought Lewis with him  
to Green Bay from San Francisco's staff in 1992, touted him as the 
best assistant in the league, and Minnesota Vikings coach Dennis 
Green said it would be a travesty if Lewis didn't get a 
head-coaching job this winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``What more credence do you need than to have your boss say  
you're the best and for your chief rival to say you're the most 
qualified?'' Lewis' agent, Bob LaMonte, said during the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lewis got just two interviews, both with the Bears, who  
bungled their search before settling on Jacksonville defensive 
coordinator Dick Jauron. 
</P>
<P>
	It was just the second time an NFL team had shown serious  
interest in Lewis, who owns four Super Bowl rings and has been to 
the playoffs 14 times. Last year, he interviewed for Dallas' head 
coaching job, which eventually went to Chan Gailey. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last three seasons, there have been 24 head coach  
openings in the NFL, and Rhodes, who was hired when Holmgren went 
to Seattle, is the only black candidate to get hired. 
</P>
<P>
	There are only three black head coaches in the NFL: Rhodes,  
Green and Tampa Bay's Tony Dungy. 
</P>
<P>
	But with Lewis' hiring, the Packers are the first team in NFL  
history with a black coach and two black coordinators; Rhodes 
brought Emmitt Thomas with him from Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite being his biggest fan, Holmgren's hands-on approach  
definitely hurt Lewis' credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	He let Lewis call all the plays in the Packers' regular-season  
finale at Chicago, when Green Bay eked out a victory despite 
resting several injured starters. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, who designed the plays Holmgren used to call during  
games, laughed when asked if his new responsibilities will bolster 
his credentials for a head-coaching job down the line. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will either make them better or worse,'' he said. ``One of  
the two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But quarterback Brett Favre, a three-time MVP, and Antonio  
Freeman, an All-Pro expected to become the league's first $6 
million receiver, could help beef up Lewis' already glowing resume. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Lewis' direction, the Packers have topped 400 points in  
each of the last four seasons and ranked in the top 10 in yardage 
every year since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said it didn't take him too long to get over his latest  
snub. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's disappointing, but it's kind of like when you lose a game  
or when we lost the Super Bowl last year: You feel sorry for 
yourself for a day or two and then you put it behind you and move 
on,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a sick feeling at first, but then just like you tell the  
players, you've got to get over it. You've just got to practice 
what you preach.''

<HEADLINE> College Students Accused of Holdups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CRUZ, Calif. (AP) -- Two University of California students  
are accused of defraying the high cost of living by teaming up with 
an elementary school instructor for two armed stickups. 
</P>
<P>
	Emma Freeman, an 18-year-old freshman at the Santa Cruz campus,  
and her boyfriend, Anthony Cristofani, a 23-year-old philosophy 
major, were charged Friday with robbing a hair salon Jan. 16 and a 
Costco warehouse store five days later. 
</P>
<P>
	``They cooked up this plan, and they decided they wanted to be  
students and not work,'' police Sgt. Steve Clark said Monday. ``She 
said she wanted to concentrate on her art and she didn't have time 
to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Cristofani's roommate, Craig Dickson, 23, an  
elementary school teaching aide, drove the getaway car. He also was 
arrested Friday. The three were traced through a description of the 
car provided by witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The three each face two counts of armed robbery and conspiracy.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm devastated,'' Linda Freeman, Emma's mother, told the Santa  
Cruz County Sentinel in today's editions. ``This is a girl who was 
a National Merit Scholar. Her only offense was to brake for a 
squirrel. Then there was a total change after she went to 
college.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A search of Dickson and Cristofani's apartment yielded a metal  
cash box stolen during the salon holdup, cash and a .380-caliber 
semiautomatic gun, police said. A white Spice Girls T-shirt like 
the one allegedly worn by the female robber on one heist was found 
in Ms. Freeman's residence, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The salon robbery allegedly netted the trio less than $100. The  
other holdup garnered a boom box and a portable radio. There were 
no injuries in either incident.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Lawyers Challenge Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Lawyers asking Britain's highest court to free  
former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet argued today that 
torture and hostage-taking are not international crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are crimes that give rise to international concern, which  
is not the same thing,'' lawyer Clare Montgomery told a seven-judge 
panel in the House of Lords. ``They are national crimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 at a London hospital where he had  
undergone back surgery at the request of a Spanish magistrate 
seeking his extradition on charges or murder, torture and 
kidnapping during his 17-year regime. 
</P>
<P>
	The warrant says Spaniards were among the victims slain after  
Pinochet overthrew elected Marxist Salvador Allende in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	The 83-year-old general is claiming immunity from prosecution as  
a former foreign head of state, but lawyers for Spain, Amnesty 
International and other human rights groups have argued that 
torture is an international crime for which no one has immunity. 
</P>
<P>
	In the sixth day of a hearing to determine the legality of  
Pinochet's arrest, Ms. Montgomery argued that international crimes 
are always specifically cited as such and must be linked to armed 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked by the judges to offer examples, she listed genocide  
and war crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``To a cynic, it might appear you are naming all these things  
incapable of definition and excluding all those things that have 
been defined,'' said Chief Lord Justice Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson, 
referring to the charges outlined in the Spanish warrant. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet's lawyers also have insisted torture can be considered  
an official act, prompting Lord Justice James Hutton to ask today 
how that argument can be justified when Chile's own constitution 
outlawed the practice in 1925. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Montgomery responded that when a new government is formed by  
force, the question becomes ``how can you determine if these acts 
are official -- certainly not by something you've overthrown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Ms. Montgomery warned the law lords to think  
carefully before tinkering with the absolute immunity the general's 
lawyers contend all heads of state enjoy -- even for acts that might 
be considered international crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Without protection, she said, leaders could be dragged into  
foreign courts on the basis of malicious and untrue allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Spain and the human rights groups have argued,  
however, that all nations have the right -- and even the duty -- to 
try anyone accused of torture, under an international law signed by 
Chile in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second time the House of Lords has considered  
Pinochet's fate. Last month, the court vacated its own 3-2 decision 
denying the general immunity after one of the judges who ruled 
against him was found to have close links with Amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
	If Pinochet loses again, a extradition battle will ensue. But if  
the law lords uphold a Nov. 25 High Court decision giving him 
immunity, he would be free to return to Chile, where he is 
protected under an amnesty law he passed before relinquishing power 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	An official Chilean government report says 3,197 people were  
killed or disappeared at the hands of Pinochet's secret police. 
</P>
<P>
	The general remains under police guard in a rented mansion west  
of London.

<HEADLINE> Senators Tackle Farm Concentration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farm-state senators complained before  
representatives of packers and big corporations Tuesday about the 
growing trend toward consolidation in agriculture, questioning 
whether recent big deals signal the end of the small family farmer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are losing family farmers at a record pace,'' said Sen.  
Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., who has called for a moratorium on approving 
any new agribusiness mergers or acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would do well by looking at an approach that says let's at  
least not let this get worse,'' he told the Senate Agriculture 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa: ``Agriculture benefits from  
the resulting efficiencies. But how big is too big?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm concerned that ownership within the hands of too few  
within the food and feed chain could harm small and mid-sized 
producers,'' Grassley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many lawmakers have expressed concerns about concentration since  
Cargill Inc. of Minneapolis, the nation's No. 1 grain company, 
announced plans to buy the worldwide operations of second-ranked 
Continental Grain Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed merger comes at a time when low prices have swept  
both livestock and commodities markets. Many lawmakers worry that 
the Cargill-Continental deal, which is being reviewed by Justice, 
will further depress prices for farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	As of 1997, the four largest packing firms accounted for 80  
percent of cattle slaughter, 54 percent of hog slaughter, and 70 
percent of sheep slaughter, USDA chief economist Keith Collins told 
senators. 
</P>
<P>
	With grain, market shares of the four largest exporting firms  
ranged from 47 percent for wheat to almost 70 percent for corn. In 
storage, Collins said, the four largest firms accounted for almost 
27 percent of total elevator capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., said that Attorney General Janet Reno  
has agreed to meet with him and Grassley in two weeks to discuss 
concentration. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, industry representatives rejected arguments that they  
were squeezing out small farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cargill and Continental did not cause or even contribute to  
low farm prices,'' said Frank Sims, president of Cargill's North 
American Grain Division. ``We believe this acquisition should be 
analyzed on its own merits, not as an accessory to tough times on 
the farm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sims said the combination of Cargill's 243 U.S. grain facilities  
with Continental's 83 U.S. grain facilities would make up only 6 
percent of total commercial storage space. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our combined business should handle about 10 to 13 percent of  
the U.S. grain moving to markets,'' Sims said. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA officials, however, have expressed concern that the  
combined companies could stifle or drive out competition in some 
local markets and at key distribution points, as well as control a 
significant amount of exports.

<HEADLINE> Harper Ready To Lead Bulls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Back in the good old days, Ron Harper  
could hang in the shadows on media day and chuckle as he watched 
reporters jockeying to get close to Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, sure, a few people would wander over in Harper's direction.  
But the attention was focused squarely on the Big Three: Jordan, 
Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	My, my, how things have changed. While reporters scurried around  
the Chicago Bulls practice facility Tuesday, clutching rosters to 
figure out just who it was they were talking to, it was Harper 
drawing the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``The media day got cut down real, real big time,'' he said,  
laughing. ``But we're a new team, we're not the old Bulls. We don't 
have the old guys here, so we have to get used to what we have here 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Harper has to get used to a new role. Rescued from a tour of  
the NBA's netherworld -- he played for Cleveland and the Los Angeles 
Clippers -- when he signed with the Bulls as a free agent four years 
ago, he's been content to stay in the background. 
</P>
<P>
	He might have been the funniest of the championship Bulls. He  
certainly was the one liked and trusted by everyone, from Jordan to 
Joe Kleine. But he also liked watching someone else -- anyone else -- 
get the attention. He just wanted to play defense, get the ball to 
his buddies on the court and get his championship rings. 
</P>
<P>
	As the only starter left from the championship Bulls and the  
most experienced player on Chicago's roster, though, it's Harper's 
turn to step up and lead the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked Harper how old he was and I went `Wow,''' new Bull Roy  
Rogers said of the 35-year-old. ``We're definitely going to turn to 
him for leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Grandfather Harper,'' Harper agreed with a laugh. ``That's  
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Named captain by new coach Tim Floyd, Harper said he's happy to  
do whatever the team wants. If that means upping his scoring 
average, OK. If it means simply doing his job on the floor and 
going home, that's fine. 
</P>
<P>
	And if it means showing the new guys and the rookies what it  
takes to play on a championship team, he can do that, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going through the flow of whatever they ask me to do.  
You just try to go out and have fun doing it,'' he said. ``The main 
thing I'll try to show them and try to tell them is in order to be 
a very good player, you must train hard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how good this basketball team is going to be. I  
don't know what to expect from this basketball team,'' he added. 
``But I will expect for us to go out and try to play hard all the 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just don't ask Harper to recite the names of everyone on the  
roster. Of the 20 players currently on Chicago's roster, Harper is 
one of just seven players who's spent time in a Bulls uniform 
before this season. 
</P>
<P>
	After just three days of practice and one scrimmage, with new  
players coming in practically every day, he's still having a little 
trouble keeping everyone straight. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're used to calling out (certain) guys names and you're  
used to seeing them. I'm not used to seeing these guys just yet,'' 
he said. ``It's only my third day here, so it's going to take 
awhile.''

<HEADLINE> No Apologies, No Remorse From LT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- If the voters for the Pro Football Hall of Fame  
expect first-year candidate Lawrence Taylor to be contrite about 
the litany of drug and personal problems that jeopardize his 
election, they've come to the wrong guy. 
</P>
<P>
	LT has no apologies and no remorse, and if that costs him  
election to Canton when the Hall of Fame voters meet Saturday, 
that's the way it goes. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't misunderstand. It's not as if Taylor, the NFL's dominant  
linebacker for 13 seasons from 1981-93, wouldn't like to be 
elected. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important because it's a reward for the years you put  
into the league,'' he said. ``It's like the final reward you can 
get in football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That said, Taylor knows his candidacy could face some roadblocks  
from voters concerned about non-football issues. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a four-game drug suspension in 1988 and two drug  
arrests after he retired. He also has pleaded guilty to filing 
false federal tax returns, declared bankrupcy and testified before 
a grand jury investigating organized crime. His driver's license 
was suspended for outstanding parking tickets, and he received 
three summonses for leaving the scene of an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't apologize for anything,'' he said Monday in a  
conference call with reporters, some of whom are on the Hall of 
Fame voting panel. ``There are some things in all our lives we wish 
we could change. Unfortunately, we can't do that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I go day-by-day. That's how I live my life right now. The past  
is the past. I can't worry about it. I can't dwell on it. There are 
consequences for every choice you make. Every day of my life, I've 
known there are consequences. From when I was a little boy and 
learned right from wrong, you know there's consequences for 
everything you do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't worry about the choices I made. When my days are over  
I'll have to answer for everything I've done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the baseball Hall of Fame, there is no citizenship  
criteria for election to Canton. The bylaws of the Pro Football 
shrine speak only of a nominee's achievements and contributions as 
a player, coach or contributor in professional football. 
</P>
<P>
	That would seem to include Taylor, and he knows it.  
</P>
<P>
	``Based on the bylaws, it should be a no-brainer,'' he said.  
``If you start going by off-the-field problems, you might have to 
kick out half the people in that Hall of Fame right now. I leave my 
Hall of Fame fate up to the voters. If I don't get in, I don't get 
in. That's life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To be elected, a candidate needs 80 percent of the vote from  
those present at Saturday's election. If all 36 electors show up, 
Taylor would need votes from 29 of them. A minimum of four and 
maximum of seven of the 15 finalists will be elected. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor knows there will be some opposition because of his  
history, which includes a number of drug rehabilitations. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's up to them,'' he said of the voters. ``I don't do the  
voting. It's not my call. That's something for you to decide. 
Whether it happens or doesn't will take care of itself. I've had 
some problems, but who hasn't? As a person, I've lived a good life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody can't be as perfect as everybody in that room. We  
make our choices and they have consequences. If my consequences 
mean not going to the Hall of Fame, you guys decide. I'm not losing 
sleep over it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd love to be there. I expect to be there. If you want to say  
LT had problems, I'm guilty. If you want to say LT had controversy, 
guilty. If you want to say there will be more controversy, guilty. 
I have that problem. Sorry. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're asking me to apologize or be remorseful for what  
I've done, I can't do that. I can't tell you what I would have done 
or could have done. I thank God I'm alive and able to have this 
conversation. There are some things I'd like to change but I can't 
change. I'm happy with who I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor is in south Florida this week, filming an Oliver Stone  
football movie titled ``On Any Given Sunday.'' He expects to return 
Sunday to New Jersey, where his son is to undergo knee surgery.

<HEADLINE> Investors Warned About Wild Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Whether they invest online or through a  
broker, people may lose money from delays in executing trades when 
the Nasdaq Stock Market is swinging wildly and overburdened, warns 
the brokers' group operating the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Some online investors may be unable to get into their accounts.  
Other people trading the old-fashioned way -- through brokers at 
full-service or discount firms -- may have trouble getting through 
to them by phone if trading volume balloons to more than the 
electronic Nasdaq market can handle, the group said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerned about the recent gyrations in Nasdaq stock prices,  
NASD Regulation, the self-policing arm of the National Association 
of Securities Dealers, also suggested that brokerage firms, too, 
warn investors of possible losses and aggravation. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq, the nation's second-largest stock exchange, has been  
whipsawed in recent weeks by roller-coaster swings in prices of 
Internet stocks -- some of them gaining or losing $50 or $60 a share 
daily in extremely heavy trading. In a trading frenzy earlier this 
month, huge volume over the Internet caused delays in online access 
for several firms, potentially costing investors thousands of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of NASD officials and executives of Wall Street trading  
firms has been meeting almost weekly since December to discuss the 
situation and possible solutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Pasternak, president and chief executive officer of Knight  
Securities Inc., the biggest Nasdaq trading company, said Tuesday 
the group was examining possible ``structural solutions.'' He 
declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	In bulletins to its member firms and in a posting on its Web  
site for investors, NASD Regulation cited the recent ``turbulent 
market conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Recent increased volatility and (trading) volume present new  
issues for investors, regardless of the method of trading,'' the 
regulators said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Customers eager to trade Internet stocks have flooded their  
brokers with large numbers of orders (to buy or sell), leading to 
large order imbalances ... and backlogs,'' one of the bulletins to 
firms noted. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, many firms have started to use procedures designed  
to keep customers' orders flowing while also reducing the firms' 
exposure to ``extraordinary market risk,'' NASD Regulation said. 
Some Nasdaq trading firms will temporarily discontinue normal 
automatic executions of trading orders, handling them manually. 
</P>
<P>
	NASD Regulation told the firms:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Their handling of customers' orders must be ``fair, consistent  
and reasonable'' and they should tell customers when unusual 
execution procedures are being used in a volatile market. 
</P>
<P>
	-- In their advertisements or sales brochures, online trading  
firms should not exaggerate the speed and reliability of their 
services. The online firms also should inform investors about the 
risks of trading over the Internet and the possibility of delays in 
trades being executed. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulators told investors:  
</P>
<P>
	-- They should educate themselves about how securities trades are  
executed, especially during periods of volatile prices and heavy 
volume. They should also ask plenty of questions before opening an 
online account or placing the first trade. 
</P>
<P>
	State securities regulators applauded the NASD's action.  
</P>
<P>
	``NASD Regulation is right to caution brokerage firms and the  
public about volatile markets,'' said Marc Beauchamp, spokesman for 
the North American Securities Administrators Association. ``News 
coverage has glamorized online trading and portrayed Internet 
stocks as the high-tech road to riches. Main Street investors -- 
unless they have the temperament of gamblers and money they can 
afford to lose -- should probably stick to mutual funds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  
declined comment on the NASD's action. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the SEC approved Nasdaq's request to expand from five  
to 15 minutes the ``window'' in which trading firms can make price 
quotes on newly released stocks, called initial public offerings, 
before they officially begin trading. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies To Re-Sign Abdur-Rahim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VICTORIA, British Columbia (AP) -- Shareef Abdur-Rahim, who led  
the Vancouver Grizzlies in scoring last season, has reached 
agreement with the team on a contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grizzlies have called a news conference for Wednesday at 2  
p.m. PST to make the official announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms were not revealed, but a source told The Canadian Press  
that he is getting a $71 million, six-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdur-Rahim has one year left on his three-year deal. He would  
have had the opportunity to become a free agent at the end of this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Selected third overall in the 1996 draft after his freshman year  
at California, Abdur-Rahim is considered the foundation of the 
Grizzlies' future. 
</P>
<P>
	A unanimous choice to the NBA rookie team in his first season,  
the forward followed that up with an outstanding second year in 
which he averaged 22.3 points per game, tied with Charlotte's Glen 
Rice for sixth in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdur-Rahim has led the three-year-old Grizzlies in scoring in  
both of his seasons with the club.
