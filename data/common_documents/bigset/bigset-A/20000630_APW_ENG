Senate OKs Limited Patient Rights
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-controlled Senate voted Thursday night for
limited new patient protections, including a restricted right to sue HMOs,
overriding Democratic protests that the plan was an election-year sham. The vote
was 51-47, largely along party lines, and capped two weeks of intense
partisanship in both the House and Senate over health care issues expected to
resonate in the fall campaign. Senate GOP Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla., said the
proposal marked a ''significant concession'' over legislation that Republicans
approved last year that barred lawsuits.

US Takes War Crimes Exemption Step
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United States said Thursday it has negotiated a
key first step toward an exemption for U.S. citizens from prosecution by the
world's first permanent war crimes tribunal. U.S. Ambassador David Scheffer, the
ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues, said he is hoping to win final
agreement from more than 100 countries when the commission preparing for the
court's operation holds its next meeting in November. Richard Dicker, associate
counsel of Human Rights Watch, said the vast majority of countries oppose a U.S.
exemption and ''if the U.S. government thinks otherwise, they have a big
surprise coming in November.''

   RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) -- A wildfire ignited by a car crash raged across the
dry sagebrush of the Hanford nuclear complex Thursday, raising fears that the
flames would spread radioactive material. At least 25 homes were destroyed, and
about 7,000 people were driven from their homes by the second blaze in two
months to threaten a U.S. nuclear weapons installation. The fire, which began
Tuesday, had scorched 190,000 acres.

Illinois Suspends Gas Tax
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Driven by some of the highest gasoline prices in
the nation, Illinois Thursday became the second state to suspend its sales tax
on gas. Legislators, voting in a special session, urged gas stations to pass
along the 5 percent tax savings on the gasoline they sell. If they do, drivers
could see prices fall by 7 or 8 cents a gallon in a state where prices in some
areas have soared well above $2 per gallon. The legislation, which was quickly
signed by Gov. George Ryan, suspends the tax for six months, starting Saturday,
and requires each gas pump to display a sign saying the tax has been lowered and
that prices should reflect the change.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Leaders resolved a last-minute snag Thursday and whisked
through the House an $11.2 billion emergency package bearing money for
Colombia's drug war, the Pentagon and storm victims at home. Months in the
making, the bill was approved by a bipartisan margin of 306-110. The Senate was
all but certain to give it final approval tomorrow, when Congress' Fourth of
July break is scheduled to begin. White House budget director Jack Lew signaled
that President Clinton would sign the measure.

Elian Homecoming Is Anticlimactic
</SUBHEAD>

   HAVANA (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez began a new chapter Thursday in his homeland,
where officials say they will work to provide the boy with as normal a life as
possible. But after months of turmoil, normalcy will be a big transition for the
6-year-old. On his first full day back in Cuba, Elian was far from the public
eye, with his father, stepmother, baby half-brother and other relatives in a
specially prepared boarding school in Havana's upscale Playa neighborhood.

The crowd of 46,998 jeered as Rocker warmed up, but the booing did not unnerve
him. Rocker struck out Robin Ventura and retired Todd Zeile and Jay Payton on
grounders. Andres Galarraga homered, tripled and drove in four runs as Atlanta
won the opener of a four-game series for the NL East lead.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Tall Ships Come To NYC  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dutch tall ship Eendracht slipped into New
York harbor on Thursday, a prelude to a Fourth of July spectacle
billed as the largest maritime event in peacetime.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 wind-powered tall ships from at least 50 nations plus
40 modern warships from 23 navies are expected for a weeklong
spectacle, with most of the ships filing into the harbor on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The beauty of a ship is when she's driven by the wind,'' said
retired Admiral Paul Welling, a 35-year U.S. Coast Guard veteran
and chief operating officer of OpSail 2000.
</P>
<P>
   During the Fourth of July festivities Monday, President Clinton
is expected to review a fleet comprising almost 10,000 military
personnel, and the celebration, expected to draw more than 4
million spectators, is to be capped with fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of other craft are also expected to flood New
York waters to watch, nearly three times the number at the 1986
Statue of Liberty centennial, according to the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   New York is the main port of call in the tall ships' nine-week
coastal cruise. The summer tour, the fifth since Opsail began,
started May 19 in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The parade left Baltimore early Thursday, led by the 170-foot
long Pride of Baltimore II, with cannons firing. After leaving New
York, its ships are to stop in New London, Conn., and Portland,
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Sail was established by President John F. Kennedy in
1961 to promote cultural exchanges. The first Opsail celebrated New
York City's World's Fair in 1964; others coincided with milestones
such as the 1976 U.S. bicentennial and the 500th anniversary in
1992 of Christopher Columbus' arrival in the Americas.

<HEADLINE> Judges Failed To Disclose Junkets  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Twenty-two federal judges who took junkets
paid for by major corporations failed to list the trips on
financial disclosure forms, as required by law, an environmental
law firm said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Several judges reportedly acknowledged taking the trips but
denied any deception, saying they simply forgot to list them on
their annual reports. One environmental group, however, has asked
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington-based Community Rights Counsel compared the
disclosure forms of the 22 judges with the attendance lists at more
than a dozen corporate-sponsored seminars in Montana and Florida.
The group characterized the educational seminars as
anti-environmental and intended to influence the judges.
</P>
<P>
   The trips, some of which lasted two weeks and cost thousands of
dollars, offered judges time for golf and horseback riding at the
island resort and historic Western retreats where they were held.
</P>
<P>
   ''Judges are taking gifts worth thousands of dollars from
corporate special interests and it is almost impossible for
litigants and the general public to uncover any details about these
gifts,'' said Doug Kendall, executive director of the CRC.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Working Group, a Washington-based research
group, wrote Rehnquist this week urging him to ban such junkets for
judge. Rehnquist heads the U.S. Judicial Conference, the
policymaking body for federal judges.
</P>
<P>
   ''As you know, the American taxpayer already pays for balanced,
rigorous continuing education for judges through the Federal
Judicial Center, obviating any alleged educational purpose of these
junkets,'' said the letter, which was also sent to members of the
House and Senate judiciary oversight committees.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post first reported the trips on its Web site
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper quoted several judges who didn't report the trips
as saying they weren't trying to hide them but simply forgot to
list the excursions when filling out their annual reports.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just slipped through,'' said Judge Michael Boudin of the
1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston. He failed to report
that he took a two-week trip to Hilton Head Island, S.C., sponsored
by the Law &AMP; Economics Center.
</P>
<P>
   District Judge John S. Rhoades of San Diego attended two Law &AMP;
Economics Center seminars but disclosed neither. ''I goofed,'' he
acknowledged. But the judge said he had no qualms about accepting
such gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're in nice places,'' Rhoades said of the seminars,
according to the Post. ''I learned a lot. Like, if you build a car
and make it absolutely safe, can anybody afford to buy it? Stuff
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The two junkets checked by the Community Rights Counsel were run
by the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment in
Bozeman, Mont., and the Law and Economics Center at George Mason
University in Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
   At the Montana outing, the environmental law firm said, judges
had golf and tennis excursions, coupled with an open bar in the
evenings.
</P>
<P>
   John Baden, the group's founder and chairman, served two terms
on the National Petroleum Council and is a member of the
conservative Mont Pelerin Society. His group has accepted funding
from the Carthage Foundation, headed by conservative publisher
Richard Mellon Scaife; foundations controlled by Charles and David
Koch, conservative brothers who run an oil and gas company known as
Koch Industries; and foundations associated with Amoco, Burlington
Resources and Shell Oil.
</P>
<P>
   The Law and Economics Center programs are taught by professors
from the University of California at Berkeley, Harvard and Rutgers,
among others. Some of its seminars are entitled ''The Assault on
Scientific Truth,'' ''Real Science vs. Junk Science'' and ''Health
and Environmental Misconceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   The center's financial backers have included the Ford Motor Co.
Fund, the Procter &AMP; Gamble Fund and the conservative Sarah Scaife
Foundation. The center says one-third of the current federal bench
has attended its seminars, held at resorts in places such as Amelia
Island and Marco Island in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Environmental Working Group asked Rehnquist to
prod the U.S. Judicial Conference to place judge's financial
disclosure forms on the Internet. After first refusing a request
from a news Web site, which later sued, the committee voted in
March to release the documents.

<HEADLINE> Police Find Five Dead in Va. Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Police checking on a tip that there might
be dead bodies in a suburban Richmond home said Thursday night they
found five bodies in the residence.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Carl Baker said a handgun was recovered, but he
would not say whether all the victims were shot. He gave no other
details about what police found inside the home during a short
briefing.
</P>
<P>
   The tip was called in to the Chesterfield County Emergency
Communications Center, said Don Kappel, the county's director of
public affairs. He said some of the victims knew each other, but
the identities and any relations to one another were being withheld
until relatives could be notified.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said a woman, two men and two children lived in the
house and had been there for at least three years.

<HEADLINE> DEC unveils management plan for Adirondack landmark  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The rustic buildings at a nationally
recognized Adirondack Park camp will be preserved and the natural
character of the land retained under a management plan released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The management plan drafted by the state Department of
Environmental Conservation proposes turning 32 acres around Camp
Santanoni into an ''Historic Area,'' creating a tourist attraction
while protecting the wild forest that surrounds the camp.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1892 by banker Robert C. Pruyn, the great camp - one of
the most notable in the region - has hosted such dignitaries as
Gov. Theodore Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   One of three properties in the 6-million-acre Adirondack Park
listed on the National Register of Historic Places, Camp Santanoni
is included in the 70,000-acre Vanderwhacker Wild Forest Area in
Newcomb, Essex County, 93 miles north of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   It also is listed on the state Register of Historic Places.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed historic area includes preservation of three
complexes of buildings: The gatehouse, the farm and the great camp.
</P>
<P>
   The buildings are all connected by a 5-mile carriage road that
would be off-limits to motor vehicles, snowmobiles and horses. The
plan would allow some motorized access for maintenance and
emergency vehicles and for the handicapped.
</P>
<P>
   The only substantive change in the land will be the provision of
extra parking at the gatehouse complex.
</P>
<P>
   All of the buildings will be preserved, a change from the
initial plan that recommended removing the farm manager's cottage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Camp Santanoni is a natural, cultural and historical treasure
that exemplifies the very best of the Adirondack Great Camps and
provides the public with an opportunity to experience and learn
about an important aspect of Adirondack and New York State
heritage,'' said DEC Commissioner John P. Cahill.
</P>
<P>
   The new draft, altered since it was first proposed in October,
also reduces the number of acres changed from wild forest to
historic, from 75 to 32. The acreage was reduced by narrowing a
corridor of land along the road from 100 to 12 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Another change from October's draft is the omission of a plan to
restore a 2 1-2 acre orchard and garden area, leaving the land as
part of the Vanderwhacker forest area. That sits well with The
Adirondack Mountain Club, according to counsel Neil Woodworth.
</P>
<P>
   The club has supported the management plan for Camp Santanoni
but thought the restoration of orchard and farm land may have been
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ''From a preservation standpoint, are these changes in the right
direction? Sure,'' Woodworth said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan now goes to the Adirondack Park Agency to determine if
it complies with the Adirondack State Land Master Plan, a 1971
document that guides land use in the park. The APA's State Land
Committee will discuss the plan July 13 and forward a
recommendation to the full APA for a vote on July 14.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, reclassification of the land falls to Gov. George E.
Pataki.

<HEADLINE> Seneca Nation president urges Pataki to veto Internet cigarette bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SALAMANCA, N.Y. (AP) - Fearing their sovereignty is in peril,
the Seneca Nation of Indians is urging Gov. George Pataki to veto a
bill they claim would affect all tribal business, not just their
lucrative Internet cigarette sales.
</P>
<P>
   ''We fear that this bill will be used to stop commerce on our
reservations. We fear that this bill, if signed by the governor,
would be used by others to erode our inherent sovereignty,'' Seneca
Nation of Indians president Duane James Ray said at a press
conference Thursday. ''The broad way that the law is written, it
could affect all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Both houses of the legislature passed the measure and it awaits
only a a signature from the governor - currently traveling in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed law would penalize carriers such as United Parcel
Service and Federal Express for delivering cigarettes that do not
meet state tax regulations by carrying the state tax stamp. That
would cover all cigarettes sold from Seneca reservations, where
Indians are allowed to sell tax-free cigarettes at much lower
prices than off-reservation outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when word of the bill's approval came to light, some
Seneca Indians threatened to hold tire-fire protests along the New
York State Thruway.
</P>
<P>
   Ray hoped it wouldn't come to that.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want the snowball effect to happen,'' he said. ''The
Seneca Nation doesn't want this to happen but we also have rights
that we have to protect. And at this point in time, it looks like
(the bill) is infringing on our rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray said the nation was especially disappointed the bill passed
unanimously without review or study.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said the bill goes against a 148-year-old treaty in which
the state recognized the Seneca Nation's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our businesses, and the businesses operated by our members,
are essential to our well-being and our economy,'' he said.
''Indian people in this state suffer from the highest rates of
poverty and unemployment. Jobs and economic opportunities are few
and far between. Retail enterprises are a small measure to fill
these unmet needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Before his departure overseas, Pataki called it a ''fair bill.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not aimed at going after sales on Indian Nations that
have existed. But we do have to make sure that those who want to
bootleg cigarettes illegally and have bootlegged cigarettes
illegally face tougher penalties and tougher laws,'' Pataki said.

<HEADLINE> Jackson Plans Vigil at Hanging Site  </HEADLINE>
By RON HARRIST
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson says he has been
assured by federal and state authorities that sufficient manpower
is being used to investigate the hanging death of a black
Mississippi teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Raynard Johnson, 17, was found hanging from a pecan tree a few
yards from the front door of his rural Marion County home June 16.
Officials said autopsy findings were consistent with suicide, but
Johnson's family questioned the ruling and called on Jackson and
others to demand a federal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also said Thursday he believes there are suspects in the
case, although officials have refused to confirm or deny that.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though the government has not officially declared someone
to be on the suspect list, there are persons who are aware of the
climate before the lynching,'' Jackson told The Associated Press.
He said many things point to a racially motivated killing,
including the fact that Johnson and his brother had been friends
with two 17-year-old white girls.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is conducting a preliminary probe, and state authorities
say their investigations continue to be a priority.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's Chicago office said a second autopsy by a forensic
pathologist at the family's request also found injuries consistent
with suicide, however toxicology tests were incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who spoke at the teen's funeral on Tuesday, said he
plans to lead a prayer vigil Sunday at the site of the hanging to
focus national attention on the death.

<HEADLINE> Labastida Still Contender in Mexico  </HEADLINE>
By KEN GUGGENHEIM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Opinion polls may show a statistical tie in
Mexico's presidential race and the opposition may have its best
shot of ending the governing party's 71 years in power. But don't
call Sunday's election a toss-up.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Labastida of the governing Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI, is still the man to beat.
</P>
<P>
   Poll numbers alone give Labastida an edge over top rival Vicente
Fox of the center-right National Action Party. That advantage is
magnified by Labastida's mightiest weapon: the PRI's powerful
electoral machine -- local politicians, unions and peasant groups
that through persuasion, fear and favors, deliver the PRI vote.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, meanwhile, has failed to capture the full opposition vote.
Third-place candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas retains a solid core of
support. Pollsters say Cardenas can't win, but he can capture
enough of the anti-PRI vote to hurt Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a Fox victory cannot be ruled out. A small-state governor
from a party with limited regional support, Fox has staged a
remarkable three-year campaign, emerging as the biggest threat ever
to the PRI's power.
</P>
<P>
   He's proven wrong the many skeptics who expected his candidacy
to fade. But he still has a way to go to capture the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Several polls in the last week of the campaign have shown
Labastida leading Fox by 3 or 4 percentage points. Given the margin
of error of the polls -- typically 2.5 percentage points -- a Fox
victory is considered possible, so the race is described as a
statistical tie. Yet the advantage remains with Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   Some opinion polls may actually overstate Fox's support.
Labastida has tremendous strength in remote, rural areas difficult
to reach by pollsters.
</P>
<P>
   And the polls don't factor in the PRI's superiority in getting
out the vote. Labastida showed how effective the PRI's machine can
be, riding it to a landslide victory in the party's first
presidential primary in November.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's party and his parallel ''Friends of Fox'' organization
don't have anything comparable.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Labastida's support is a diehard PRI vote that Fox has
no chance of capturing. For many Mexicans, a vote for the PRI is
almost instinctive, a sign of national pride. Others fear the loss
of social programs. And some votes are bought by gifts provided by
local PRI governments, such as bicycles and washing machines.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's best hope has been to lure Cardenas' backers, persuading
them that Fox is the only candidate who can stop the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Cardenas' support has not waned. In opinion polls, he hovers
around 15 percent to 18 percent. He insists he will win and, in the
final weeks of the campaign, has stepped up attacks on Fox, whom he
accuses of selling out to U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
   Fox still has a few strengths. He has the support of younger,
better-educated, urban voters. A giant turnout in major cities
would be a big boost. Also, opinion polls show many voters were
still undecided in the final weeks of the campaign -- and some
analysts say many of them may be Fox supporters scared to state
their preference.
</P>
<P>
   Fox stands to benefit from years of electoral reforms that have
led to opposition victories in state and local elections, cost the
PRI its majority in Congress and have made this presidential
campaign the fairest in modern Mexican history.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters have a feverish enthusiasm that's rare in Mexican
politics. They can taste what would be an astonishing victory that,
to them, represents not only the triumph of a candidate but a giant
leap in Mexican democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Fox can only hope that on Sunday, that fever will be contagious.

<HEADLINE> Man Claims He Has Hostages at Disney  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE SCHNEIDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- An armed man held his 4-year-old
son and a waiter hostage Thursday at a Walt Disney World hotel and
demanded to speak to his estranged wife, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators and a police psychologist talked to the man and the
hostage at the Boardwalk Inn, said Sgt. Bernie Presha, a spokesman
for the sheriff's office. The waiter was taken hostage when he
delivered food to the man's hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has threatened to harm himself and he has threatened to
harm the people with him,'' said Jim Solomons, another sheriff's
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The man, identified by officials as 39-year-old Bismark
Rodriguez, called television station WKMG twice and said he hadn't
seen his other three children in 30 days and he wanted to speak
with them and his wife. He said he and his wife of 14 years are
going through a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I wanted was a divorce. ... She said we couldn't be
friends if we had a divorce,'' he told the station. ''Twenty times
she's taken my kids, then she goes to court, plays her little
things and I'm too nervous to tell them how I feel. All they do is
'OK, whatever, whatever' and the woman's always right and that's
not true.''
</P>
<P>
   He claimed to have several guns and a bomb and said he would
release the hostages of he could speak to his wife. The hostages,
identified as Rodriguez's son Christopher and 42-year-old Rafael
Carmona, were still being held after midnight, about 10 hours
later.
</P>
<P>
   Some rooms in the 910-room deluxe hotel, which has an Atlantic
City boardwalk theme, were evacuated. The rest of the sprawling
resort, which includes 17 hotels operated by Disney, was operating
normally, Presha said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez called the Orlando FBI office and requested a hostage
negotiator, Orange County Sheriff Kevin Beary said. Rodriguez
recently lived in nearby Kissimmee
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just trying to keep him calmed down,'' Beary said,
adding that Rodriguez's relatives were on their way to the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Rhonda Powell, a visitor from LeSueur, Minn., was headed to a
restaurant near the hotel when she saw the sheriff's helicopters
and dozens of officers blocking off the area, in the heart of the
Walt Disney World complex.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't expect this to happen here,'' Powell said. ''You
think you're in a fantasy land here.''

<HEADLINE> European Feels Pinch at Gas Pump  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE STANLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Although gasoline prices traditionally are higher
on this side of the Atlantic, typically submissive European
consumers are clamoring for relief from worsening pain at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   From Britain to Hungary to Finland, the outrage at rising gas
prices sounds almost, well, American in its intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Prices are outrageous,'' seethed Budapest book publisher Tamas
Bekes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's madness,'' said Valerie Khoury, a housewife in suburban
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   European motorists are long accustomed to paying as much as four
times what Americans shell out for a tankful of gas, due to fuel
taxes that can add a staggering 80 percent to the retail gas price
in the region. Nonetheless, they have become more dependent on
their cars, for pleasure as much as for work.
</P>
<P>
   ''The car for Italians is a habit, a tradition, like
spaghetti,'' said Italian taxi driver Michele Di Russo at a filling
station in central Rome. ''Gas prices will not affect its usage.
The car is entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   As in the United States, where prices have soared in some areas
to more than $2 a gallon, recent increases in the price of crude
oil used to make gasoline are sending prices up. The cost of
unleaded gas has risen by 16 percent in France, 14 percent in Italy
and 11 percent in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   There are few signs that resentment at the increases is
ferocious enough to boil over into a consumer rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   ''People have been bludgeoned by one successive rise after
another. We're so used to them, we've become desensitized,'' said
Michael Johnson, spokesman for the Automobile Association of
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   According to Johnson's organization, the average price for a
gallon of unleaded gasoline in Britain this month is $3.27 -- more
than twice what Britons paid a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Norway is the only European nation with costlier gas, at $3.31 a
gallon, the AA said. France is the next most expensive, at $2.80,
followed by Italy, Germany, Portugal, Austria and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The difference from one country to the next is due mostly to
government taxes, which in Britain and France account for more than
80 percent of the price of gas. Finland had the next highest fuel
tax, at 78 percent, followed by Belgium and Poland at 75 percent
each, the AA said.
</P>
<P>
   This tax bite has left some motorists feeling passive and
powerless.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't really do anything about it. It's in the hands of the
government,'' said office worker Norah Lydon, who spoke as she
filled her tank in the London suburb of Edgware.
</P>
<P>
   An average 27 cents of every dollar that Americans spend at the
pump goes toward tax. Thus the tripling in world oil prices since
December 1998 has caused gasoline prices to spike more dramatically
in the United States than in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just not the big deal here that it is in the U.S. because
the price is masked by tax,'' said Jeremy Elden, an oil and gas
industry analyst at Lehman Brothers in London.
</P>
<P>
   Klaus Rehaag of the Paris-based International Energy Association
argued that the U.S.-style car culture is not as strong in Europe,
where large cities have good public transportation and are linked
by dense rail networks.
</P>
<P>
   But discontent over gas prices appears widespread and rising.
</P>
<P>
   ''Prices are just ridiculous,'' said Risto Hyvonen of Helsinki,
Finland. ''I don't drive any less now. But whereas before I used to
tank up at any old gas station, now I look for special offers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Finance Ministry in neighboring Sweden has received 80,000
letters in the past few months alone protesting its 70-plus percent
tax on gasoline, ministry spokesman Haakan Boberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Public pressure already has proven effective in Austria. Last
month, the Austrian state-owned oil company agreed to trim 2.5
cents off each gallon of unleaded gas after automobile clubs and
labor groups complained that the country's prices were among the
highest in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, costlier gas is forcing up prices for taxi rides,
pizza deliveries and even emergency visits from locksmiths.
</P>
<P>
   Some Europeans are economizing by planning errand trips more
carefully and taking buses or subways where convenient.
</P>
<P>
   But Czech businessman Martin Kukas spoke for many in the region
when he acknowledged his automobile dependency.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even if the price goes up further, there's nothing I can do,''
he said at a busy intersection in downtown Prague. ''I just need to
use the car.''

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 7, Astros 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Randy Johnson pitched five-hit ball over eight
innings, tied his season high with 13 strikeouts and got his
NL-leading 12th victory as the Arizona Diamondbacks beat the
Houston Astros 7-1 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Finley hit his second homer in as many nights for the
Diamondbacks, who won for the sixth times in eight games to remain
two games ahead of the Colorado Rockies in the NL West.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson (12-2) walked three and hit a batter as he ran his
league-leading strikeout total to 177 and lowered his league-best
ERA to 1.57. Johnson reached the double-digit strikeout mark for
the 12th time in 17 starts this season and 137th time in his
career.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Mantei pitched a perfect ninth to complete the five-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Reynolds (6-5) retired six of the first seven hitters he
faced before running into trouble in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Damian Miller led off with a double off the wrist of shortstop
Julio Lugo and advanced to third on Tony Womack's groundout. Jay
Bell then lined a double down the left-field line, scoring Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds walked Luis Gonzalez before Finley his 22nd homer, a
three-run shot into the right-field stands to extend the
Diamondbacks' lead to 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   A baserunning error by Richard Hidalgo helped short circuit an
Astros' rally in the fourth. Craig Biggio led off with a walk,
Hidalgo walked one out later and Moises Alou lined a single to
left. Biggio scored as left fielder Luis Gonzalez's throw was cut
off, but Hidalgo was tagged out trying to reach third.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson walked Matt Mieske, his third walk of the inning, but
struck out Tony Eusebio to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds gave up six runs on eight hits over 7 2-3 with two
walks and six strikeouts for his fifth loss in six decisions.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Houston has lost five of six and is 8-20 since May 29. ...
Johnson was making his first appearance against the Astros and has
faced every club except the Diamondbacks. ... Julio Lugo and Jeff
Bagwell each stole bases against Johnson, who has allowed six
steals in his last two starts. Lugo also was thrown out trying to
steal the third to end the third inning. ... Before the game, the
Diamondbacks placed 1B Erubiel Durazo on the 15-day disabled list
with soreness in his surgically repaired right wrist, and recalled
OF Jason Conti from Triple-A Tucson. Conti had a pinch-hit RBI
single in the eighth, his first major league at-bat. Durazo is the
third Arizona player to go on the DL this week, following 3B Matt
Williams and RHP Todd Stottlemyre. ... Astros reliever Jay Powell,
on the DL since June 9, was diagnosed with a sprained right
shoulder by Dr. Jamie Andrews, and will be out another 2-3 weeks.

Man Claims He Has Hostages at Disney
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- A armed man held his 4-year-old son and a
waiter hostage Thursday at a Walt Disney World hotel and demanded to speak to
his estranged wife, authorities said. Negotiators and a police psychologist
talked to the man and the hostage at the Boardwalk Inn, said Sgt. Bernie Presha,
a spokesman for the sheriff's office. The waiter was taken hostage when he
delivered food to the man's hotel room. The man, identified by officials as
39-year-old Bismark Rodriguez, called television station WKMG twice and said he
hadn't seen his other three children in 30 days and he wanted to speak with them
and his wife. He said he and his wife of 14 years are going through a divorce.

Senate OKs Limited Patient Rights
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-controlled Senate voted Thursday night for
limited new patient protections, including a restricted right to sue HMOs,
overriding Democratic protests that the plan was an election-year sham. The vote
was 51-47, largely along party lines, and capped two weeks of intense
partisanship in both the House and Senate over health care issues expected to
resonate in the fall campaign. Senate GOP Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla., said the
proposal marked a ''significant concession'' over legislation that Republicans
approved last year that barred lawsuits.

Mrs. Gore Assures Women on Abortion

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A day after the Supreme Court's narrow vote striking down
a state abortion ban, Tipper Gore said her husband would protect a woman's right
to end a pregnancy and urged women supporters to help elect him president in
November. On Wednesday, Vice President and Democratic presidential contender Al
Gore said the next president will fill up to four vacancies on the court and
warned abortion-rights supporters against electing Republican presidential rival
George W. Bush. Bush opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incest or to save
the woman's life.

Illinois Suspends Gas Tax
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Driven by some of the highest gasoline prices in
the nation, Illinois Thursday became the second state to suspend its sales tax
on gas. Legislators, voting in a special session, urged gas stations to pass
along the 5 percent tax savings on the gasoline they sell. If they do, drivers
could see prices fall by 7 or 8 cents a gallon in a state where prices in some
areas have soared well above $2 per gallon. The legislation, which was quickly
signed by Gov. George Ryan, suspends the tax for six months, starting Saturday,
and requires each gas pump to display a sign saying the tax has been lowered and
that prices should reflect the change.

other, but the identities and any relations to one another were being withheld

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Embroiled in Discontent  </HEADLINE>
By PRISCILLA CHEUNG
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- First the protesters were radical activists and
students, and there were only a few of them. Then came lawyers and
doctors, teachers and middle-class homeowners, who took to the
streets by the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   As Hong Kong prepares this weekend to mark the third anniversary
of its reunification with China, a rash of recent anti-government
protests reflects an unexpected trend in the former British colony:
Citizens are far angrier at their own government than the one in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints involve everything from the territory's
struggling economy and several sweetheart business deals won by
local tycoons to air pollution. Not to mention education, health
care, the civil service and the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   ''The biggest surprise after the handover has been the fact that
Hong Kong people are not able to rule Hong Kong,'' said Sonny Lo, a
political scientist at the University of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Britain returned Hong Kong's sovereignty to China on July 1,
1997, after 156 years of colonial rule. Shipping tycoon Tung
Chee-hwa was selected as the territory's leader by a 400-member,
Beijing-appointed committee.
</P>
<P>
   Under Sino-British agreements, Hong Kong can maintain its
capitalist lifestyle for at least 50 years and the local government
can enjoy a high degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   But the transition hasn't been easy.
</P>
<P>
   The territory has just begun rebounding from a deep recession
sparked by the Asian financial crisis. Many people remain
unemployed, while others have seen their assets lose value on the
free market.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, smog and haze are choking the city like never
before, mainly because of industrial pollution from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   ''People gave Tung the benefit of the doubt, but his honeymoon
is over,'' said Timothy Wong, a political analyst at the Institute
of Asia Pacific Studies at Chinese University. ''They are losing
confidence in what was once a highly efficient government after
several blunders.''
</P>
<P>
   When China first sent troops to the territory as Britain
withdrew, many people worried about a possible crackdown on their
personal freedoms, ones that mainland Chinese residents have never
enjoyed under a communist government. That fear led to a series of
protests by radicals and pro-democracy students, but those worries
proved unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most hot-button issues is concern that Hong Kong's
cherished and famous level playing field for businesspeople has
been tilted in favor of well-connected tycoons.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a British-based think tank, the Economist Intelligence
Unit, knocked Hong Kong from No. 1 to sixth place in its ranking of
locations to do business in the next five years. It cited a high
likelihood that the Hong Kong government will give preferential
treatment to local and mainland interests.
</P>
<P>
   ''Much of the deterioration is due to political and regulatory
changes after the 1997 handover to China,'' the Economist
Intelligence Unit said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Li, son of Hong Kong's wealthiest man, Li Ka-shing, won
the right to develop a government lot into a high-tech industrial
park, dubbed the Cyberport, without the routine bidding process.
</P>
<P>
   Some powerful property tycoons seemed just as angry as the
protesters in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Li's start-up Internet firm also defeated Singapore
Telecommunications Ltd. in a bid to buy Hong Kong's oldest telecom
firm. Li's bid came amid news reports that Beijing had disapproved
of the Singapore deal because it did not want a foreign firm to
control the local telecom giant.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cronyism in creeping in,'' said Martin Lee, a prominent lawyer
and leader of the opposition Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been controversy over China's handling of the
territory's courts. Lawyers worry that Hong Kong's rule of law --
regarded as a safeguard of human rights and commercial integrity --
is giving way to China's judicial system, where many cases are
tried in closed courts.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, many citizens are angry at massive reforms that
Tung has proposed in education, health care, welfare, tax laws, the
financial markets and the civil service.
</P>
<P>
   Many homeowners, whose apartments have lost half their value,
blame Tung's housing policy. He has introduced measures designed to
keep property prices low and to boost home ownership, and they
depressed the property market, which is vital in this land-strapped
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Tung is too eager to make his mark as the first post-handover
leader and is trying to do too much, too fast, political analysts
say.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tung doesn't understand that he's running a government, not
his own private business,'' said architect Simon Kao, 45.
</P>
<P>
   ''He always tries to be the big father,'' Kao added. ''You can't
force people to embrace the changes without asking them whether
they wanted anything changed.''

<HEADLINE> Man Releases Hostages In Disney  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE SCHNEIDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- An armed man demanding to speak to
his estranged wife held his 4-year-old son and a waiter hostage at
a Walt Disney World hotel for more than 10 hours before releasing
them unharmed and surrendering early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bismark Rodriguez, 39, gave up after a negotiator told him he
could spend time with his three other children if he surrendered,
said a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez had threatened to harm himself and the people with
him, said Jim Solomons, a sheriff's spokesman. He claimed to have
several guns and a bomb and said he would release the hostages from
his room at the Boardwalk Inn if he could speak to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages were identified as Rodriguez's son Christopher and
42-year-old Rafael Carmona, who was grabbed when he delivered food
to the room Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Rodriguez called television station WKMG twice and said
he hadn't seen his other three children in 30 days and he wanted to
speak with them and his wife. He said he and his wife of 14 years
are going through a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I wanted was a divorce. ... She said we couldn't be
friends if we had a divorce,'' he told the station. ''Twenty times
she's taken my kids, then she goes to court, plays her little
things and I'm too nervous to tell them how I feel. All they do is
'OK, whatever, whatever' and the woman's always right and that's
not true.''

   Some rooms in the 910-room deluxe hotel, which has an Atlantic

<HEADLINE> Rocker Address New York Fans  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- John Rocker returned to New York with pen in
hand, trying to clean up the damage caused by his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving at Shea Stadium, he went to the press room and
delivered another apology, one that his teammates said for the
first time sounded sincere.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, the situation has continued to escalate about
my presumed hatred for the people of New York,'' he said. ''The
comments I made over six months ago offended many people. I am
fully aware of this, and for that I sincerely apologize.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves third baseman Chipper Jones said Rocker's apology sounded
genuine, especially compared to his March statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a lot better than the one in spring training. It
sounded like it came more from him,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   For months, many Braves had wondered if Rocker was speaking
words others had written.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sounded like he was sincere in his apology,'' winning
pitcher John Burkett said.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the brash Rocker of October, who called Mets fans
''stupid'' and said ''it's a lot of fun to know that I can get in
these people's heads and can get them to react the way I want them
to. All that does is fire me up.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a contrite Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by a Braves officials, he walked into the old New
York Jets locker room underneath the right-field stands, carefully
making his path through a crowd of reporters, went to a podium in
front of a Mets logo and read what he had written, holding the
original papers, crossouts and all.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets showed a tape of the speech on their 26-foot-high video
screen in left field, just before the first pitch of the hyped
series.
</P>
<P>
   ''First of all, I would like to say that I am happy to be back
in New York, believe it or not,'' he said, sounding more like a
politician than a pitcher. ''I've been involved in some great games
and always seem to pitch well here.''
</P>
<P>
   It was no different Thursday. Rocker pitched a perfect eighth
inning as Atlanta beat New York 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   His comments in October angered fans, and his remarks to Sports
Illustrated in December sparked a nationwide furor. Because of his
anti-New York, anti-foreigner, anti-gay diatribe, he wound up with
a two-week suspension, making his return to Shea a major event that
attracted hundreds of reporters who crowded the field during
batting practice as if it were a postseason game.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rocker couldn't resist taking a slight shot at reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, many members of the media have overestimated my
significance,'' he said. ''I am merely a baseball player, guys, and
in the great scheme of things, my thoughts, opinions and attitudes
are of little importance.
</P>
<P>
   ''In many cases, attempts have been made to make this situation
bigger than the game itself, and in every realm of sports, nothing
is the bigger than the game. Not the players who play it, not the
fans who watch it and not the people who write about it.''
</P>
<P>
   He read slowly, pausing between some words for emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have apologized and have felt badly for anyone who took my
comments personally,'' he said. ''My comments weren't made with
intentions of malice. However, many people perceived these comments
to be malicious, and for this, I apologize once again.

<HEADLINE> Fliers Aim To Earn Million Miles  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- In the world of frequent flier miles, call
it the Holy Grail.
</P>
<P>
   Latin Pass, a frequent-flier program for a consortium of 10
South and Central American airlines, said it would award 1 million
miles to anyone who took at least one international flight on each
of its member airlines plus a flight on one of its three partner
airlines, stayed three nights in participating hotels and rented a
car for five days from partner agencies.
</P>
<P>
   They gave six months, from Jan. 1 to July 1, to qualify, but Dan
Hacker, a 37-year-old systems analyst from Silver Spring, Md.,
needed just a week.
</P>
<P>
   ''One group figured out a way to do it in three and a half
days,'' Hacker said as he surveyed the plush lobby of polished wood
and marble of the Guatemala City Marriott, a $105-per-night hotel
he spent less than six hours staying in. ''I figured a week was
fast enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Hacker's million-mile quest started June 17 when he left
Baltimore Washington International Airport for Miami on US Airways,
one of the U.S. partner lines. Then it was on to Caracas,
Venezuela, on Aeropostal; to Bogota, Columbia, on Avianca; and to
Quito, Ecuador, on Aces.
</P>
<P>
   From there he flew to Lima, Peru, on Aces (which counted for a
flight on Saeta, a consortium member not operating now), then to
Cuzco on Taca-Peru (a domestic flight that counted because
Taca-Peru doesn't have international flights).
</P>
<P>
   Hacker gave himself a free day to visit the ancient Incan ruins
at Machu Pichu because ''my wife wouldn't let me do this without
actually seeing something,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The final phase of the solo journey saw the father of two, who
says he's ''slightly obsessed'' with free mileage, head back to
Lima on Taca, and then take a Copa flight to Panama City; to San
Jose, Costa Rica, and to Guatemala City. Then he flew to San
Salvador, El Salvador, on Aviateca; to Managua, Nicaragua, on Taca;
and to San Jose on Copa, before flying back to Managua on Lacsa.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Miami on Taca, a flight that counted for Nica,
which is not operating now.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have been having fun, I really have,'' said Hacker, who
brought three changes of clothes in a single carry-on bag during a
trip that saw him spend only about 27 hours actually in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The whole trip cost him $3,000, but Hacker figures his week of
work is earning him $10,000 -- the estimated value of free tickets
awarded for 1 million frequent flier miles.
</P>
<P>
   Free trips usually cost frequent fliers many more miles than
they actually turn in. For example, a business class trip from the
United States to Europe on any Latin Pass airline costs 90,000
miles.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can fly the whole family to Europe five times for free after
this,'' Hacker said.
</P>
<P>
   He was hardly the first million-mile-trekker whose trip raised
eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   ''These people rented a car, but when our concierge asked them
where they were planning to go, they said it was just going to sit
in the parking lot,'' said Melvie Lopez, a desk receptionist at the
Holiday Inn Guatemala -- one of a slew of well-known chains
affiliated with Latin Pass.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Singer, 41, who works for a firm that manages patient
hospital records in Seattle and has exploited all kinds of frequent
flier programs, said Latin Pass is the sweetest deal offered so
far.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every year some idiot in marketing comes up with a program
like this they think three or four people will qualify for,'' said
Singer, whose frequent-flier exploits have taken him everywhere
from La Paz to Laos -- all for free.
</P>
<P>
   The Latin Pass reward of 1 million miles, technically enough to
go to the moon and back twice or to circle the globe 43 times, will
also be good on the program's partners -- US Airways, KLM and TWA --
or could be bartered for free nights at hundreds of partner hotels
all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Even Latin Pass, where everything from renting a car in Lima to
shopping in certain South Florida-area malls earns you miles,
admits its promotion has worked a bit too well.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 people have qualified so far, but would-be
millionaires flying in June won't be tallied for several weeks,
said Guy Booth, the promotion's director.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't create a monster here, but publicity did get a bit
out of control,'' Booth said. ''It has put Latin Pass on the map,
but the costs of all the free miles we will have to give away will
begin to add up.''

Man Releases Hostages In Disney
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- An armed man demanding to speak to his
estranged wife held his 4-year-old son and a waiter hostage at a Walt Disney
World hotel for more than 10 hours before releasing them unharmed and
surrendering early Friday. Bismark Rodriguez, 39, gave up after a negotiator
told him he could spend time with his three other children if he surrendered,
said a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Office. Rodriguez had
threatened to harm himself and the people with him, said Jim Solomons, a
sheriff's spokesman. He claimed to have several guns and a bomb and said he
would release the hostages from his room at the Boardwalk Inn if he could speak
to his wife.

European Feels Pinch at Gas Pump
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Although gasoline prices traditionally are higher on this side
of the Atlantic, typically submissive European consumers are clamoring for
relief from worsening pain at the pump. From Britain to Hungary to Finland, the
outrage at rising gas prices sounds almost, well, American in its intensity. As
in the United States, where prices have soared in some areas to more than $2 a
gallon, recent increases in the price of crude oil used to make gasoline are
sending prices up. The cost of unleaded gas has risen by 16 percent in France,
14 percent in Italy and 11 percent in Belgium.

Senate OKs Limited Patient Rights
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-controlled Senate voted Thursday night for
limited new patient protections, including a restricted right to sue HMOs,
overriding Democratic protests that the plan was an election-year sham. The vote
was 51-47, largely along party lines, and capped two weeks of intense
partisanship in both the House and Senate over health care issues expected to
resonate in the fall campaign. Senate GOP Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla., said the
proposal marked a ''significant concession'' over legislation that Republicans
approved last year that barred lawsuits.

Illinois Suspends Gas Tax
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Driven by some of the highest gasoline prices in
the nation, Illinois Thursday became the second state to suspend its sales tax
on gas. Legislators, voting in a special session, urged gas stations to pass
along the 5 percent tax savings on the gasoline they sell. If they do, drivers
could see prices fall by 7 or 8 cents a gallon in a state where prices in some
areas have soared well above $2 per gallon. The legislation, which was quickly
signed by Gov. George Ryan, suspends the tax for six months, starting Saturday,
and requires each gas pump to display a sign saying the tax has been lowered and
that prices should reflect the change.

what police found inside the home during a short briefing. The tip was called in

good day -- learning several hours before game time that most of their players
facing suspensions won't have to miss any games. After trailing 5-2, the Dodgers
narrowed the gap to 5-4 in the seventh when Alex Cora led off with a triple then
scored on Carlos Reyes' balk, and Shawn's Green hit an RBI single off Kevin
Walker.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Ruling Snarls Doctor Vote  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Friday to extend collective
bargaining powers to doctors contracted to HMOs. Supporters said it
makes doctors battling managed care cost-cutting stronger advocates
for patient rights while opponents warned of rising health care
costs and more uninsured Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation passed 276-136 despite earlier approval of an
anti-abortion amendment that supporters charged was an attempt to
strip away backing from abortion rights lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   That amendment, offered by Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., prohibits
discussions of abortion coverage from collective bargaining
negotiations. It passed 213-202.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation amends antitrust law to give health care
professionals the same rights enjoyed by union workers to negotiate
with health insurance plans over fees, treatments and other
contract items.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, said chief sponsor Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., is
''in favor of patients if you believe they are not being adequately
taken care of under today's medical care system because there is
not a balance between doctors and the HMOs.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the last order of business before the House left for the
weeklong July 4 recess and fulfilled a promise House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill., made last year to Campbell to bring the bill to
the House floor. It was co-sponsored by Rep. John Conyers of
Michigan, senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, a moderate and candidate for the Senate in California,
has championed the measure in the face of opposition from GOP
leaders and the business, insurance and health care groups that
give financial backing to the party. It still faces formidable
obstacles in the GOP-controlled Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health
Plans, called the bill ''the most anti-consumer piece of
legislation in decades'' and cited studies saying it would drive up
health care premiums by 8.6 percent and add 3 million to the list
of uninsured Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But Campbell said that while uniting doctors might mean less
profit for HMOs, the opposition's claims of a surge in health care
costs were exaggerated and the benefits to consumers -- from doctors
being better able to represent their interests against HMO abuses --
were far more important.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors would not be allowed to strike and the bill would
terminate after three years so its economic effects could be
analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell was aided by strong sentiments among lawmakers in both
parties that Congress must act to ensure that managed care plans
don't put profits before the interests of patients. Both the House
and Senate have passed patient rights bills, but the issue of what
rights patients should have to sue HMOs has impeded efforts to come
up with a common bill.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association has strongly backed the
Campbell bill, and AMA Executive Vice President E. Ratcliff
Anderson said its passage ''will send a loud message that it is not
acceptable for big insurance companies to dictate patient medical
care in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, doctors who are employed by a hospital or
municipality may unionize and the AMA says that as of last year
about 40,000 doctors belonged to labor organizations. But most of
the nation's 650,000 doctors have been subject to anti-trust laws
that ban collective bargaining by the self-employed.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn, a family physician, said his anti-abortion language was
necessary so Catholic hospitals and others with philosophical
objections wouldn't be forced to offer abortion services.
</P>
<P>
   Conyers said it was an ''anti-choice gag rule'' aimed only at
killing the bill but urged members to back the base bill in spite
of the Coburn provision.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's backers did manage to defeat several other ''poison
pill'' amendments, including one by Rep. Cass Ballenger, R-N.C.,
stating that negotiating rights not be extended to discussions of
fees. It was defeated 345-71 as several lawmakers with medical
backgrounds argued that it was impossible to improve quality care
for patients without also considering the adequacy of payments to
physicians.
</P>
<P>
   While Coburn opposed the bill on the grounds that it would drive
up health care costs, four other Republicans with medical
backgrounds, plastic surgeon Greg Ganske of Iowa, internist Dave
Weldon of Florida, OB/GYN Ron Paul of Texas and dentist Charlie
Norwood of Georgia, argued strongly for it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a mess, we have a monster we have created. All we are
asking is a little bit of return of freedom to the physician,''
Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 1304.

<HEADLINE> Solomon Islands Elect New PM  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONIARA, Solomon Islands (AP) -- Lawmakers in the Solomon Islands
elected opposition leader Mannasseh Sogavare as the new prime
minister Friday, a move observers hope will end months of ethnic
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ''My new government will address the crisis that has been
affecting this nation this last 19 months,'' Sogavare said after
the vote, which he won 23-21. ''My government is committed to bring
Solomon Islands into national unity and reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction from the former government or
from rebel groups who have been fighting on the nation's main
island, Guadalcanal.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for rebels from Malaita island previously said his
group would accept any of the three candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Sogavare replaces ousted Prime Minister Bartholemew Ulufa'alu,
who was forced from office by the Malaitan rebels after they seized
the capital, Honiara, on June 5.
</P>
<P>
   The Malaitans launched the coup amid a long-running ethnic
dispute with the indigenous Isatabus of Guadalcanal, where the
capital is located.
</P>
<P>
   They were angry that the Isatabus have expelled 20,000 people
who migrated from nearby Malaita island in recent decades to find
jobs and land. Violence in recent months has killed up to 60
people.
</P>
<P>
   The Malaitan rebels control the capital while the armed Isatabu
group controls the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   The vote Friday went ahead amid tight security after a vote
scheduled for Wednesday was called off because government lawmakers
refused to attend, citing safety fears.
</P>
<P>
   All but six of Parliament's 50 legislators attended Friday's
vote.
</P>
<P>
   One of the government candidates withdrew from the election so
as not to split the government vote.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Malaitan rebels had warned that a cease-fire
that has held for more than two weeks could shatter if the
government impasse was not resolved quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the politicians are not willing to resolve the current
crisis politically, the (Malaita rebels) may pursue the military
option,'' said Andrew Nori.

<HEADLINE> 3 Hurt in Laos Blast  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- A homemade bomb injured at least three
construction workers in Vientiane, the latest in a series of
unsolved explosions in the Laotian capital, diplomats and officials
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The explosive planted alongside the Mekong River went off
Wednesday night, injuring workers inside a bamboo hut. It was not
clear how badly the three, who were from Vietnam, were hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has claimed responsibility for a series of blasts that
have hit the once-placid city over the past three months. Other
targets have included a tourist restaurant, the bus station and the
central market.
</P>
<P>
   The communist regime, which has ruled since 1975, believes it is
a terrorist campaign designed to undermine its credibility and hurt
its efforts to attract more tourists to the poor Southeast Asian
nation.
</P>
<P>
   A Laotian diplomat at the embassy in Bangkok said on condition
of anonymity that he believes the blasts are aimed at creating
instability in Laos.
</P>
<P>
   The Laotian government said that earlier this month it arrested
two people in Vientiane carrying explosives, but it did not
identify them. The suspects have yet to go to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign embassies have issued travel warnings about the security
situation in Vientiane and upgraded existing advisories about
remote central provinces because of an upsurge in ethnic unrest
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Hmong insurgents who have been fighting a low-level resistance
war in the jungle since 1975 have rarely if ever attacked urban
areas, and analysts have cast doubt if they would be able to
penetrate the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Many Hmong fought for a U.S.-backed army in Laos against Laotian
communists during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   The Laotian and Vietnamese communists remain strong allies and
continue to monopolize political power in their countries.
Vietnamese military have reportedly assisted Laos in fighting the
insurgents this year, but the two countries deny this.

<HEADLINE> Female Circumcision Denounced  </HEADLINE>
By HARMONIE TOROS
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Female circumcision can be eradicated
within a generation, women's rights activists say, urging
governments and international organizations to move against the
practice through legislation and education.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 130 million women, most of them in Africa, have
been subjected to ritual genital cutting -- a figure that is
believed to grow by up to 2 million each year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I call upon more governments, more policy-makers, and the
United Nations and other bodies to be stronger in terms of sending
the message (that) 'this is wrong,''' said Nahid Toubia, co-author
of ''Female Genital Mutilation: A Guide to Laws and Policies''
presented at U.N. headquarters on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Female genital mutilation or female circumcision can be
stopped within a generation,'' said co-author Anika Rahman of the
U.S.-based Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, a grass-roots
organization that campaigns against the practice.
</P>
<P>
   The practice is illegal in 18 countries, nine of them in Africa,
according to the research. Laws also have been passed in
industrialized countries with communities of African immigrants,
such as the United States, where a federal law bans ritual genital
cutting of females.
</P>
<P>
   Laws prohibiting the practice are not only a matter of
punishment, the activists said.
</P>
<P>
   It tells people that the country -- government and civil society
-- has decided the practice is wrong, and gives ''some power to the
people who want to say no,'' said Toubia, a doctor from Sudan,
where the practice is widespread.
</P>
<P>
   Toubia, who leads a group working on health and human rights of
African women, countered the argument that such laws go against
traditions and cultures.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before we start thinking about our communities, and our fears
for our cultures, and our fear of the disintegration of our
traditions, we have to think about one single girl. A child who is
held, scared, petrified, screaming, through a very traumatizing
experience, having a very sensitive part of her body cut,'' Toubia
said.
</P>
<P>
   Often done without anesthesia, the practice can range from
clipping or burning the clitoris to cutting off all the external
genitals and sewing the remnant tissue to leave a tiny opening.
</P>
<P>
   But laws aren't enough, Rahman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stopping female genital mutilation requires profound social
change,'' said Rahman. ''Legal change must be accompanied by public
education and other campaigns, and it must be thought in an overall
framework to promote women's rights and their status.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month at a U.N. conference to accelerate progress
toward equality for women, 180 countries called for laws to
eradicate harmful traditional practices including female
circumcision.

<HEADLINE> Senate Address Genetic Bias Concerns  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate rejection of broad new workplace and
insurance protections against genetic discrimination, including a
right to sue, signals a go-slow approach in Congress to the
dilemmas posed by the decoding of the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   ''This issue deserves and requires a thorough discussion in its
own forum,'' Sen. Jim Jeffords, R-Vt., said, while acknowledging
that ''we need to guard genetic privacy and guard against genetic
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords, chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee, promised comprehensive hearings on genetics bias just
before the Senate voted 54-44 along party lines Thursday to defeat
a Democratic measure that would have enacted a host of new privacy
protections.
</P>
<P>
   The debate followed this week's landmark announcement that
public and private researchers had essentially deciphered the
entire human genetic code, or genome. The breakthrough opens a new
universe of possibilities in preventative medicine but also raises
fears that private health information could be used to discriminate
against people prone to certain diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation the Senate rejected would have prohibited
employers from using genetic information in hiring and workplace
promotion or salaries. It also would have prevented insurance
companies from basing coverage or premiums on genetic information
and from requiring genetic tests to get coverage, and would have
permitted an individual to take discrimination claims to court.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot take one step forward in science and two steps
backward in civil rights,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.D. ''Discrimination based on genetic factors is just
as unacceptable as that based on race, national origin, religion,
sex or disability.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Senate opted by a 58-40 vote for Jeffords'
alternative setting up similar restrictions on use of genetic
information by insurance companies and group health plans but doing
nothing on workplace discrimination or a right to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the Democratic approach was hasty and would
result in numerous court claims.
</P>
<P>
   ''This isn't the right way to do it,'' said Sen. Mike Enzi,
R-Wyo. ''This becomes a turnstile for trial attorneys.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate came on amendments to the annual appropriations bill
that funds the departments of Labor, Education and Health and Human
Services. President Clinton has threatened to veto the $352 billion
spending bill -- expected to pass today -- because of its spending
levels and other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate did approve two competing ''lockbox'' provisions
aimed at preventing budget surpluses in the Medicare program from
being used for spending or tax cuts, which is similar to
legislation already passed by the House. Clinton embraced the
Democratic version.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before we make any other major budget decisions this year, we
should agree that Medicare funds should not be used to finance tax
cuts or other spending,'' the president said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also attached legislation -- criticized by Democrats
-- giving 56 million people limited new medical rights, such as
access to emergency room care and to out-of-network physicians.
People also would have a restricted right to sue their HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton announced before the overall spending bill even
reached the Senate floor that he would veto it, contending it would
not reduce classroom sizes by providing money he wants to hire
100,000 new teachers and would not guarantee $1.3 billion in loans
and grants to repair crumbling schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate last week also added another provision opposed by the
administration that would block Labor Department rules giving
workers new protections against repetitive motion injuries.

<HEADLINE> McCormick Distilling agrees to extra $1 million civil penalty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WESTON, Mo. (AP) - McCormick Distilling Co. has agreed to a $1
million civil penalty on top of $1 million in restitution already
paid to settle charges stemming from its participation in a scheme
to smuggle liquor to Eastern Europe and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The payment, along with McCormick's earlier agreement to suspend
operations for seven days beginning Saturday, is part of a
settlement resolving alleged violations of the Federal Alcohol
Administration Act.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is probably the most substantial case, in terms of the
breadth of the penalty, that we have handled in the last 20
years,'' said Jeff Cohen, assistant chief counsel with the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. ''We consider this to have been
very serious misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, the privately owned McCormick pleaded guilty in
Newark, N.J., to a misdemeanor charge of falsifying liquor export
documents to avoid paying excise taxes overseas. Federal
authorities said the liquor, disguised as industrial alcohol, was
sold by Russian mobsters on the black market as beverage alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month McCormick paid $1 million to the Ukrainian
government to compensate it for excise taxes it was unable to
collect as a result of the smuggling scheme. The 144-year-old
company, the oldest continuously operated distillery in the
country, also agreed to pay a $10,250 criminal fine to the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCormick is now in the clear, the two-year probe into
the smuggling scheme continues. Federal authorities are focusing on
mob influence at New York shipping harbors and other distilleries.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the investigation resulted in the arrests of seven
people on money laundering charges.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects, all natives of former Soviet republics and most
now living in Brooklyn, N.Y., reportedly have ties to Russian
organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Undercover agents approached the suspects, pretending to be
acting on behalf of big drug traffickers in Florida and South
America whose operations ''generated a lot of cash,'' in the words
of the indictments.
</P>
<P>
   The agents gave cash to several of the suspects during more than
20 secretly recorded meetings at different hotel rooms. The
suspects allegedly returned the cash to the agents, less a 25
percent commission or checks payable to dummy companies formed by
the agents.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mosley, director of industrial operations in the Kansas
City field division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,
said he couldn't comment on the ties between the suspects and
McCormick, ''other than that product manufactured and sold by
McCormick was going into the hands of these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said McCormick has cooperated in the investigation, which
also involves the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service and the Customs
Service.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of McCormick's participation in the smuggling scheme
remains unclear, but court documents filed in New Jersey said a key
official ''within substantial authority'' at McCormick was
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the U.S. attorney in Newark ''made the decision not
to prosecute any higher-ups at the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Documents filed by federal prosecutors alleged that from April
1995 to December 1997, McCormick improperly identified alcoholic
beverages shipped to Russia and Ukraine as industrial products,
using descriptive labels such as ''Cleaning,'' ''Cleansol'' and
''Rainbow Cleaning Solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The company reportedly added food coloring to the alcohol to
make it look like paint solvent, windshield washer fluid and other
industrial products. Once the alcohol was in Russia and Ukraine,
members of the Russian mob were said to have removed the food
coloring and sold the liquor on the black market.

<HEADLINE> Low-Income Car Insurance Tested  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY BREZNICAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A plan to reduce the number of uninsured
motorists by lowering premiums in Los Angeles and San Francisco
begins Saturday with civic leaders across the nation watching to
see if it could work elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe it's the best insurance that's ever come along,''
said 66-year-old Grace Luna, who has applied for the low-cost
policy.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which was approved by the Legislature last year,
will be run by the California Automobile Assigned Risk Plan, a
coalition of insurance companies. The agency can find car insurance
for problem drivers who would have difficulty getting it otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Connecticut, Illinois and New Jersey have asked
for data on whether significant numbers of people sign up for the
plan. Also watching are Washington, Kentucky and Louisiana, which
have considered similar programs, CAARP regional director Richard
Manning said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're looking to see how well it does, how effectively it is
presented to the public and how many people end up buying the
insurance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   California's proof-of-insurance law requires owners of the
state's nearly 27 million vehicles to show they have coverage when
they register with the Department of Motor Vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   But in high-risk, inner-city areas, many residents risk
illegally driving without insurance rather than pay premiums that
can run three times as much as those offered in the pilot program.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 1.8 million vehicles out of 6 million in Los Angeles lack
insurance and nearly 80,000 out of 412,000 in San Francisco,
according to Tim Hart, spokesman for the state Insurance
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''But we don't know how many of the people in those areas will
qualify for the program,'' Hart said. ''That's why it's called an
experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   Participants must have clean driving records and meet income and
other guidelines to be eligible for the four-year pilot program. It
charges $450 annually for a bare-bones auto policy in Los Angeles
County and $410 in the San Francisco area. There is a 25 percent
surcharge for unmarried, male drivers 19 to 25.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Heller of the Santa Monica-based Foundation for Taxpayer
and Consumer Rights supports the program.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now many people who can't afford regular coverage will no
longer have to make that unfair decision between breaking the law
and getting to work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Luna, a retired union worker who lives in South Gate, a
blue-collar community southeast of Los Angeles, is already paying
for a bare-bones policy for her 1980 Chevrolet Citation -- too much,
she says.
</P>
<P>
   ''The insurance company I'm with now, they are charging me more
than $700 yearly, and the broker who handles my policy is charging
me $150 yearly, and that's a heck of a lot of money for me,'' said
Luna, who said she is disabled and survives on Supplemental
Security Income.
</P>
<P>
   The low-cost policies satisfy the minimum amount of auto
insurance required by the state, but will not pay drivers for
injury to themselves or damage to their own cars, regardless of who
caused the accident.
</P>
<P>
   But participating in this program will enable them to collect
pain and suffering settlements if another driver is at fault, which
uninsured motorists are prohibited from doing under a 1996 state
law.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of the policies include $10,000 in liability for
one person's medical bills, as much as $20,000 to cover more than
one person and $3,000 for damage.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance company lobbyists and consumer advocates agree that
all insured motorists may eventually benefit from the low-cost plan
because the cost of uninsured motorist coverage will diminish.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's because the likelihood of running into someone who
doesn't have insurance will go down,'' Heller said. ''It's the
secret gift of this new plan.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Will Sign Bill For Colombia  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Its passage greased with lawmakers'
home-district projects, an $11.2 billion emergency measure for
Colombia, the Pentagon and victims of domestic disasters finally
has a clear path to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate planned to give final congressional approval to the
package on Friday, a day after the House endorsed it by 306-110.
</P>
<P>
   The lopsided margin belied the bill's stop-and-start journey
through Congress, which began in February when President Clinton
asked for $5.2 billion. In the end, most members could not resist
the election-year largesse it contained for the Long Island Sound's
struggling lobster industry, law enforcement along the
Arizona-Mexico border, and much in between.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that the bill ''will make our nation safer and more
secure,'' Clinton indicated that he stood ready to sign it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has been four months since I first sent this request to
Capitol Hill, and the needs are all the greater today,'' he said
after the House vote.
</P>
<P>
   The highest profile item was $1.3 billion to help Colombia's
government prevail in its four-decade conflict against drug
traffickers and their heavily armed left- and right-wing allies.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., pushed
hard for the money, which they argue will help stem the flow of
cocaine and heroin from Colombia. The South American country
supplies more than 80 percent of the cocaine used in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ''This Colombian aid package is an investment in our future -- a
future free from the scourge of drugs,'' Hastert said after the
vote
</P>
<P>
   Their combined drive for the money overwhelmed opposition by
members of both parties. Opponents cited allegations of Colombian
human rights abuses, fear of U.S. involvement in an unwinnable,
four-decade-long conflict, and a preference to use the money for
drug prevention programs at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''A profound mistake,'' is how Rep. David Obey, D-Wis.,
described the Colombian aid.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the aid is to provide the Colombians with 60 Blackhawk
and Huey helicopters, train and equip Colombian military and
national police battalions, and for intelligence activity.
Officials envision retaking portions of southern Colombia that the
rebels control, and fumigating jungle coca fields.
</P>
<P>
   There would also be money for human rights programs in Colombia,
for Bolivia, Ecuador and other nearby countries, and for U.S.
aircraft performing anti-drug surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also contained $2 billion to refill Pentagon accounts
drained to pay for the 5,700 U.S. troops in the NATO peacekeeping
team in Kosovo. There was also $4.4 billion more for fuel, health
care and other Pentagon programs -- including $40 million in for
Vieques, Puerto Rico, site of the Navy's controversial bombing
range.
</P>
<P>
   There was also $661 million to help New Mexico rebuild from the
blazes that ravaged Los Alamos and other communities; $350 million
for fighting other wildfires; about $360 million to help North
Carolina and other states recover from last September's Hurricane
Floyd and other agricultural problems; and $600 million to help
low-income families pay their utility bills.
</P>
<P>
   In a setback for environmentalists and the administration,
conservatives won language blocking forthcoming Environmental
Protection Agency rules aimed at reducing industrial and
agricultural run-off into polluted streams and lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Money for lawmaker's pet projects, however, knew no political
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   There was $110 million for a new Great Lakes icebreaker to be
based in Wisconsin, home state of the House Appropriations
Committee's top Democrat, Rep. David Obey.
</P>
<P>
   Two U.S. Senate candidates -- Reps. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., and Bob
Franks, R-N.J. -- won projects to boast about. Lazio was trumpeting
$6 million for homeless shelters nationwide, part of which was
going for a veterans' shelter in Buffalo, N.Y. Franks won $41
million for New Jersey communities damaged by floods spawned by
last September's Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   There was also money for a bicycle path in the northern Virginia
district of Rep. James Moran, D-Va.; to repair a federal
hurricane-chaser plane based in the Tampa district of House
Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla.; to continue
work on a sealife institute in Seward, Alaska, home state of Senate
Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency money was attached to a routine $8.8 billion
measure financing military construction projects for 2001.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Ex-girlfriend testifies in Columbia University student murder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A former girlfriend of Edmund Ko testified in
his murder trial that he restrained her on a barren New Jersey road
while his girlfriend viciously slashed her face, scalp and legs in
a jealous rage.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Kim, 26, testified in State Supreme Court in Manhattan on
Thursday that Ko, 26, held her arms while Claudia Seong, 34,
slashed her scalp so deeply that the knife entered her skull.
Seong's younger sister, Young Joo Seong, sat on her knees to pin
her down, Kim said. The Seongs have been charged in the attack and
freed on bail.
</P>
<P>
   The November 1997 attack was four months before another former
girlfriend of Ko's, Hyeseung Lynda Hong, 26, was found dead in her
apartment near Columbia University, where she was a law student.
Ko, of Fort Lee, N.J., is being tried for Hong's murder.
</P>
<P>
   Kim said Ko contacted her in June 1997, shortly after their
two-month relationship ended, and told her she was among the former
girlfriends he was telling not to contact him or acknowledge him in
public because he was in a new relationship. Hong had similarly
been warned, according to court testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Ko did not contact Kim again until the early morning of Nov. 18,
1997, when, after several phone calls, she agreed to meet him at 3
a.m., Kim said. Kim said she was picked up by Ko and the Seongs,
and was driven to a deserted stretch of road.
</P>
<P>
   After Ko pushed and hit her, Kim said, he pushed her backward
over a barricade. Pinned to the ground by Ko and the younger Seong,
Kim said she was then slashed by Claudia Seong, and was left to
walk home covered in blood.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the trial, testimony has repeatedly focused on the
elder Seong, of Ridgefield Park, N.J., who refused to answer any
questions in her courtroom appearance earlier this month. Both
sides have acknowledged that she is violently jealous. Seong has
not been charged in Hong's slaying.

<HEADLINE> Boats Search for Indonesia Refugees  </HEADLINE>
By GEOFF SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANADO, Indonesia (AP) -- Dozens of local fishing boats joined
Indonesian naval vessels to search for survivors Friday after a
ship carrying nearly 500 people, including hundreds of refugees
fleeing sectarian bloodshed, vanished during a violent storm.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers scoured the waters of eastern Indonesia, looking for
any sign of wreckage or survivors, said search and rescue
coordinator Ering Musa.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing has been found so far,'' Musa said. ''There have been
no reports of survivors clinging to bits of the ship's wooden hull
or the boat itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Heavy seas and low cloud cover over the waters north of Sulawesi
island were hampering the search, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Radio contact with the Cahaya Bahari, a wooden-hulled vessel
overloaded with 492 passengers and crew, was lost Thursday after
its captain radioed that it was fast taking on water during a storm
about 1,440 miles northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   The boat was on a journey of more than 200 miles to Manado, the
capital of North Sulawesi province, from the Maluku islands, a
corner of the Indonesian archipelago where violence between Muslims
and Christians has killed almost 3,000 people in the past 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   The ship's agent in Manado, Theddy David, said the 40-yard-long,
420-ton vessel was licensed to carry only 290 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   But it was packed with frightened refugees from Duma, a
Christian village in the Malukus where more than 100 people were
killed in an attack by Muslim fighters June 19, he said. Since the
Duma attack, at least 71 people have been killed in Ambon, the
provincial capital of the Maluku islands.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic fighters say they are only standing up for the rights of
Muslims who face attacks by Christians. Muslims make up about 90
percent of Indonesia's 210 million people, but Christians are in
the majority in many parts of the Malukus.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers had been accused of doing little and of actively taking
sides in the region, known as the Moluccas or Spice Islands during
Dutch colonial days.
</P>
<P>
   After surviving the Duma massacre, the refugees took the ship
ride to be reunited with families and friends who had earlier found
shelter on Sulawesi island.
</P>
<P>
   Waters in tropical Indonesia are warm, but Musa said there were
fears for the safety of any survivors as the seas in the area are
infested with sharks. Indonesian ships of this kind rarely come
equipped with life jackets or life boats.
</P>
<P>
   The closest land is Siau island, some 40 miles to the west.
There were no immediate plans for an aerial search, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Search and rescue officials in Manado said two fishermen were
picked up Friday floating in the water after their small boat
capsized in the same storm.
</P>
<P>
   Ship disasters with large losses of life are all too frequent in
Indonesia, an ethnically and religiously diverse nation of about
17,000 islands where sea transportation is vital. Maritime
standards are lax and poorly maintained vessels are often
overloaded with passengers and cargo by captains eager to maximize
profits.
</P>
<P>
   In May, 40 people drowned after an overcrowded ferry capsized
after leaving Ambon. Last November, 361 people died when a ferry
sank off West Papua, and in February 1999, 332 people perished near
the coast of West Kalimantan.

<HEADLINE> Gay Couples Prepare for Civil Unions  </HEADLINE>
By ROSS SNEYD
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTLAND FOUR CORNERS, Vt. (AP) -- Pierre Fournier has been in a
committed relationship for the last 12 years, but marriage plans
have always been on hold because his partner is another man.
</P>
<P>
   That's all about to change.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday afternoon, Fournier and Richard Waddell will stand
before 45 friends and neighbors in the lush gardens behind their
house and recite vows of commitment they wrote together.
</P>
<P>
   With that simple ceremony, they will be among the first same-sex
couples in the country whose relationship receives the official
sanction of a state government under Vermont's landmark civil
unions law.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see this as an acknowledgment of our very close friends and
neighbors in town who have supported us from the minute we moved
here,'' said Waddell, who, like Fournier, is 53.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont lawmakers, asked to respond to a state Supreme Court
ruling that gay couples were being unconstitutionally denied the
benefits of marriage, stopped just short of allowing gay marriage
in April.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they created civil unions, a legal institution parallel
to marriage that will provide the same rights, benefits and
responsibilities. The law takes effect Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in America, gay couples will be recognized by
their state government as next of kin for the purposes of survivor
benefits, taxes, medical decision-making and some 300 other state
rights that automatically flow to opposite-sex couples when they
marry. Federal benefits, such as Social Security and some tax
measures, remain off limits.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Legislature chose to call it something
different, the ceremonies that will be taking place across Vermont
will have all the trappings of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Couples will be obtaining licenses from their town clerks and
then will have their civil unions ''certified'' by a justice of the
peace, a judge or a member of the clergy.
</P>
<P>
   For Fournier, a piano teacher, and Waddell, who's on the
infectious disease research faculty at Dartmouth College in nearby
New Hampshire, the ceremony will be a community celebration and an
opportunity to publicly declare their love and commitment. They had
a commitment ceremony a decade ago, but the event was simpler and
without legal meaning.
</P>
<P>
   The couple settled on ties and sports jackets for the ceremony
after much debate. They will exchange rings crafted by their local
state representative, Democrat Derek Levin, who voted in favor of
civil unions.
</P>
<P>
   Their union will be ''acknowledged'' by the local justice of the
peace who agreed to preside, and party guests will gather back by
the house for food, wine and music.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a gift,'' Fournier said. ''I have always wanted to get
married, but I long ago gave that up. So it's much more than just
legal elements. This is my one time.''

<HEADLINE> Database Keeps Tabs on Doctors  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PACE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dr. Gary Hall says he doesn't mind if patients
can see a secret federal database that shows he's had $5.3 million
in malpractice payments and has been censured, fined and placed on
probation by his state medical board.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't feel that I'm dangerous to my patients at all,'' the
Phoenix ophthalmologist said in an interview. ''I feel like I've
always acted in my patients' best interests.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the National Practitioner Data Bank is opened to the
public, as patient advocates want, then Hall said the government
has an obligation to ensure that the information is presented in
the proper context.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm all for providing information to the consumer as long as
the information is presented fairly,'' he said. ''I don't think the
way the databank presents it is fair to the physician. At least
it's not fair to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall is one of nearly 500 doctors and dentists across the
country who have been slapped with at least 10 disciplinary actions
and malpractice payments over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Those actions and payments are documented in the national data
bank, which the Department of Health and Human Services has been
compiling since 1990. One of every seven U.S. doctors and one of
every eight dentists has at least one report in the data bank.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates and a key congressional Republican are
pressing to disclose the names to help patients shop for doctors.
Most doctors oppose such a release, arguing that the data is skewed
by malpractice insurance settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Hall was censured last year by the Arizona Board of Medical
Examiners, fined $15,000, placed on three years' probation and
barred from performing one type of eye surgery, radial keratotomy.
He acknowledged that being identified as one of the doctors with
the most records in the database ''makes you look very guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hall said most of his malpractice cases were settled by
insurers ''for economic reasons'' without his consent. And the 27
complaints that resulted in malpractice payments, he said, amounted
to less than 0.1 percent of the eye operations he has performed
since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   If that type of information is provided to patients along with
the data bank numbers, Hall said, ''Then I don't have a problem
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The data bank was created by a 1986 federal law that requires
insurance companies, hospitals and state and federal regulators to
report malpractice payments and disciplinary actions against all
health care providers. It is a voluntary compliance system -- with
no auditing by the government -- and nearly 60 percent of hospitals
have yet to make a report.
</P>
<P>
   The government provides a version of the database to the public,
but strips out the names of doctors and dentists and other
identifying information. That's because the law permits the
identities and most details of the malpractice payments and
disciplinary actions to be shared only with insurance companies,
hospitals and federal and state health regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Although many states disclose their disciplinary actions against
doctors, patients don't have a single national repository where
they can check their practitioner's history.
</P>
<P>
   That may soon change.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the House Commerce
Committee, is considering releasing over the Internet the names of
the 200 doctors and dentists with the worst records, according to a
committee aide, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors' lobby opposes the release.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Reardon, president of the American Medical
Association, said the raw data on malpractice payments ''is not
reflective of competency or quality.'' He said only one malpractice
settlement in five concerns negligence.
</P>
<P>
   ''The concept of the data bank was to collect data for licensing
and credentialing'' of doctors, he said, ''not for release to the
public.''
</P>
<P>
   Bliley's push to open the database follows decisions by 41 state
medical boards since 1996 to begin disclosing on their Web sites
the names of doctors they discipline.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Daily News and The Hartford Courant used that
information and court records earlier this year to identify doctors
with large numbers of malpractice payments or disciplinary actions.
The Associated Press used the national database with no names to
calculate the national figures and used state records to identify
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News identified 15 medical practitioners with the most
malpractice lawsuits in the state of New York. Four have had their
licenses suspended. The Courant identified Hall and seven other
doctors nationwide with at least $3 million in malpractice payments
and 25 or more reports in the databank. Four still are practicing.
</P>
<P>
   AP's review of court records and state disciplinary records
found:
</P>
<P>
   --Menominee, Mich., dentist Thomas Neumeier had 37 malpractice
payments totaling $550,000 over three decades before the state
licensing board put him on probation for three years in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Neumeier sees 12 to 14 patients a day, and blames most of his
troubles on a single lawyer who helped patients file more than 20
lawsuits against him. ''I could have fought every one of these
cases, and nine-tenths of them I would have won,'' the dentist
said.
</P>
<P>
   --Oklahoma City surgeon Joe Dan Metcalf faced more than 30
lawsuits and was ordered to pay nearly $300,000 in malpractice
judgments in the early 1990s, state and court records show. His
license was suspended for one year in 1996 after he pleaded guilty
to illegally importing silicone-gel breast implants. A five-year
probation was imposed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   --In Wisconsin, three-fourths of the 54 doctors who made
malpractice payments of $1 million or more in the 1990s faced no
disciplinary action from the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''The filing and paying of a malpractice action does not mean a
doctor is bad,'' Patrick Braatz, administrator of Wisconsin Health
Professions and Services Licensing. ''That doesn't mean the doctor
is good either. You have to look at the underlying facts of each
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's Health Research
Group, said opening the database would provide patients with a
central place to check records of prospective doctors or dentists.
</P>
<P>
   ''It needs to be in one place and it needs to be nationally
based,'' said Wolfe, whose consumer group compiles a report every
two years on state-disciplined physicians. ''When you go to the
state, all you get is the disciplinary actions taken by that state
against doctors licensed in that state.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Manes, a Long Island, N.Y., orthopedic surgeon, said
information in the database ''could be misleading to the layman
unless they have access to both sides of a particular case.''
</P>
<P>
   With 26 reports in the database, including $3.9 million in
malpractice payments, Manes said his own practice has suffered
since he was identified by both the Courant and Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure it's had some detrimental effect but I still have a
very good practice and my patients still have confidence in me,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Manes blamed his large number of malpractice payments on the
large volume of patients he sees and on the fact that Long Island
has the most malpractice cases per resident in the country.

<HEADLINE> SBC Long-Distance Bid To Be OK'd  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- SBC Communications is on the brink of
receiving federal approval to offer long-distance calling in Texas,
which would mark only the second time a regional Bell telephone
company has secured permission to provide that service to its local
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission is expected to clear SBC's
application, allowing the company to offer customers one-stop
shopping for their phone and Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has until Wednesday to issue its decision, but
experts have widely predicted that SBC would receive regulatory
approval.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Rep. Gene Green, D-Texas, issued a news release
saying a majority of the commissioners had approved the
application. Green said his office had been notified early in the
day that an announcement was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Green said other lawmakers, including Rep. John Dingell of
Michigan, the top Democrat on the House Commerce Committee,
received similar word from the FCC. Dingell's staff confirmed that
they were contacted by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Green said he spoke with FCC Chairman William Kennard in the
afternoon. Based on that conversation, Green said he understood
that a majority of the commissioners had voted to approve the
application
</P>
<P>
   ''I think SBC will be given the right to enter long-distance,''
Green said. ''That's good for Texas and the people I represent.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he thought a final announcement may not come until next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, FCC officials asserted that no final action
had been taken. Commission decisions do not become final until all
five members have voted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will have a commission action on this soon,'' FCC
spokeswoman Joy Howell said.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Miller, a spokesman for the San Antonio-based company, said
it had not been notified of any decision.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic became the first company to secure FCC permission
to offer its local customers long-distance calling last year,
earning that right in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   SBC, which operates in 13 states, is the nation's largest local
phone company. However, it will drop to No. 2 when the Bell
Atlantic-GTE merger is completed.
</P>
<P>
   SBC's long-distance application has been bolstered by support
from the Justice Department and Texas state regulators. Although
the FCC has the final word, it must give weight to both
evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook for the application seemed particularly favorable
since the Justice Department gave its approval. It marked the first
time the department has backed a Bell company's attempt to offer
long-distance service within its local calling region.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department originally recommended that SBC's
application, filed at the beginning of this year, be denied. Bell
companies must satisfy a 14-point checklist meant to ensure their
market is open to rivals before they get approval to offer
long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department supported the application after it said
the company provided data showing it improved handling rivals'
requests to use its lines for high-speed Internet service. SBC also
improved the processing of orders to switch local phone customers
to competitors, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 telecommunications law sought to increase competition in
local markets by allowing Bell companies to offer long-distance
service if they opened local service to competitors. The approval
would be another step toward that goal.

<HEADLINE> FAA To Launch Maintenance Checks  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fresh from forcing Alaska Airlines to make
significant changes in its maintenance programs, federal regulators
are turning their attention to the nation's nine other major
airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Lacey, director of flight standards for the Federal
Aviation Administration, said Thursday that three teams of federal
inspectors will fan out in July to take a close look at the largest
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The effort is expected to last four months and then turn to the
larger regional airlines and cargo carriers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came as the FAA reported that Alaska Airlines,
under scrutiny since a January crash off the coast of California,
has made enough improvements to continue doing maintenance on its
planes.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA had threatened to strip the airline of the right to do
maintenance -- a step that could have eventually grounded all its
planes -- unless its programs were improved.
</P>
<P>
   Lacey said his inspectors will continue to closely monitor
Alaska, but added, ''We are ... encouraged by what we have seen so
far.''
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing in Seattle, the airline's president, John F.
Kelly, said, ''We're very pleased that the FAA has accepted our
plan ... we really tried to go above and beyond what they asked
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacey said the inspections of the other airlines will involve
three teams of a half-dozen safety inspectors each. They will begin
their work on July 17, focusing on maintenance programs.
</P>
<P>
   He said the aim is to identify successful programs and safety
practices so airlines can share them with one another. If problems
are found, he said, the FAA will not hesitate to act.
</P>
<P>
   Lacey declined to reveal which airlines will be visited first,
but said he expects to make the results of the inspections public.
The nine major carriers are American Airlines, America West,
Continental, Delta, Northwest, Southwest, TWA, US Airways and
United.
</P>
<P>
   The close inspection of Alaska Airlines began after the Jan. 31
crash of Flight 261 in the Pacific Ocean off Los Angeles, killing
all 88 aboard. Allegations of unsafe maintenance work, which first
surfaced in 1998, were thrust back into the spotlight. The cause of
that accident remains under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In its audit, the FAA uncovered nearly 150 cases in which
aircraft maintenance could not be documented. A reinspection of the
planes showed that the work had actually been done, but the lack of
documentation raised serious concerns about supervision and could
eventually lead to civil fines.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA said that unless the airline came up with improvements
in its procedures it would lose the authority to do maintenance and
would not be allowed to hire outside companies to do the work. That
would have meant that the carriers' planes would be grounded, one
by one, as they came due for work.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the FAA said Alaska has developed a plan to hire
150 additional maintenance workers -- 82 have been hired so far --
filled previously vacant safety executive posts, revised its heavy
maintenance procedures and made other changes.
</P>
<P>
   Lacey said FAA inspectors will continue to monitor the carrier
until mid-July to make sure it is continuing to follow its plan.
</P>
<P>
   If it is not satisfied with continuing progress, he added, the
FAA will not hesitate to lift its maintenance authority ''or take
stronger action, if the facts warrant.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that if all goes well the FAA will recheck Alaska's
program 90 days after the mid-July report and again six months
after that.
</P>
<P>
   Changes are also being made in the way the FAA routinely
supervises Alaska, he said, with the normal complement of
inspectors to be increased from 12 to 18.

<HEADLINE> Tests Reveal Possible Fat Fighter  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists were testing a possible cancer
treatment when they spotted a side effect that might prove rather
valuable: The experimental drug made mice lose a dramatic amount of
weight, without apparent side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Just 20 minutes after taking the chemical, the rodents'
appetites were wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery indicates scientists may be able to regulate a
major pathway in the brain responsible for appetite and
fat-building. The chemical apparently fooled the brain into
thinking the mice had eaten, so their metabolisms never slowed and
they burned fat, researchers report in Friday's edition of the
journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a real trick. The mice drop their weight like a stone,
losing 25 percent of their body mass in a couple of days,'' said
Dr. Frank Kuhajda, who led the research team at Baltimore's Johns
Hopkins University that produced the chemical, code-named C75.
</P>
<P>
   No one yet knows if C75 would work in humans, experts caution.
More animal research is needed before dieters could even test it.
</P>
<P>
   But, the Hopkins discovery is ''extraordinarily intriguing and
provocative,'' said Denis McGarry, an expert on fat metabolism at
the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. If
confirmed, he said, ''it would obviously have a profound impact on
the field of obesity research.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have long hoped for better weight-loss treatments. Over
half of all Americans are overweight, and about one-quarter are
obese, government estimates show.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is ''fatty acid synthase'' or FAS, an enzyme system
pivotal for turning carbohydrates into the building blocks of fat.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, in the early 1990s scientists discovered cancer
cells use FAS to produce their own fat for fuel, Kuhajda said. No
one knows why. But the Hopkins researchers created a FAS blocker to
see if it could fight cancer. In mouse testing, this so-called C75
made cancer cells die without harming nearby normal cells, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the mice all had a stunning side effect: They stopped eating
and dramatically lost weight until the drug wore off.
</P>
<P>
   Weight loss in a cancer patient is a serious problem, so the
puzzled scientists began hunting an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that production of a brain chemical called
neuropeptide Y -- a well-known appetite regulator -- plummeted in the
C75-treated mice. Normally when animals fast, neuropeptide Y
sharply jumps and appetite consequently increases. But the C75
prevented that, fooling animals into thinking they were fed,
Kuhajda said.
</P>
<P>
   How? To build fat, FAS uses another molecule called malonyl-CoA.
Blocking FAS didn't stop the body's normal production of that
molecule. Instead, malonyl-CoA just piled up without that next step
in the fat-building assembly line. High levels of the molecule
somehow signaled the brain not to produce neuropeptide Y, Kuhajda
said.
</P>
<P>
   C75 didn't permanently harm the appetite system. When scientists
injected C75-treated mice with neuropeptide Y, they immediately
stuffed themselves. When C75 wore off, they ate normally and
regained weight.
</P>
<P>
   But C75 had another important benefit, the researchers reported.
One reason dieting is so hard is that fasting slows metabolism.
Metabolism didn't seem to slow in the C75-treated mice, however --
they lost 45 percent more weight than untreated mice deprived of
food.
</P>
<P>
   The Hopkins researchers are pursuing C75 as a possible cancer
treatment, figuring appetite suppression isn't an insurmountable
side effect. But the newest findings ''give us some hope'' of a new
way to fight obesity, too, Kuhajda concluded.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Sign e-Signature Bill  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When President Clinton officially signs a bill
giving an online ''John Hancock'' the same legal status as one
etched on paper, he'll do it electronically but will have
previously signed it with an ink pen.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bill deals with commercial contracts. It doesn't make an
effort to change the way in which laws can be signed,'' was White
House spokesman Jake Siewert's explanation of why the president
must scrawl his ''William J. Clinton'' the old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was to sign the ''e-signature bill'' into law Friday in
Philadelphia at Congress Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will sign the bill the way John Hancock autographed the
historic document that established the United States as a nation --
with a pen. Afterward, he'll electronically sign the bill to
demonstrate digital signing technology that will let consumers who
shop online for a new car or home mortgage seal their deals with a
few clicks on their computer keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House and the Senate passed e-signature bills last
year, but it took months of negotiation between Congress and the
Clinton administration to work out a compromise that protected
consumers from abuses without overly burdening businesses with new
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The final version, which passed 87-0 in the Senate and 426-4 in
the House, requires a consumer to agree to electronically signed
contracts and consent to receiving records over the Internet.
Companies must verify that customers have an operating e-mail
address and other technical means to receive information.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation law takes effect Oct. 1. As of March 1, 2001,
companies could begin the electronic retention of legal records
such as mortgages and financial securities.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an opportunity for the president to showcase this new
technology and the possibilities it offers to business and
consumers,'' Siewert said. ''The government can do e-signatures
when it comes to commercial transactions, and this law anticipates
that.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Clinton has signed his name electronically
before: In September 1998 in Dublin, Ireland, he and Irish Prime
Minister Bertie Ahern sat at matching laptop computers and used
''smart cards,'' personalized codes and digital readers to
electronically affix their signatures to an electronic commerce
agreement.

<HEADLINE> FCC Nears Bell Long-Distance Ruling  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators, for only the second time,
are on the verge of allowing a Bell company to offer long-distance
telephone service to its local customers.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission is expected to approve the
bid by SBC Communications to provide long-distance in Texas, one of
the states within its local calling region.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has until Wednesday to issue its decision, but
experts have widely predicted that SBC would receive regulatory
approval, and on Thursday, a Texas House lawmaker said a majority
of the commissioners had approved the application.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman, Rep. Gene Green, D-Texas, said in a Thursday
afternoon press release that the commission had approved the deal.
Green said his office was notified early in the day that an
announcement was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Green said other lawmakers, including Rep. John Dingell of
Michigan, top Democrat on the Commerce Committee, received similar
word from the FCC. Dingell's staff confirmed that they were
contacted by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Green said he spoke personally with FCC Chairman William Kennard
in the afternoon. Based on that conversation, Green said he
understood that a majority of the commissioners had voted to
approve the application
</P>
<P>
   ''I think SBC will be given the right to enter long-distance,''
Green said. ''That's good for Texas and the people I represent.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he thinks a final announcement may not come until next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, FCC officials asserted that no final action
had been taken yet. Commission actions do not become final until
all five members have voted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will have a commission action on this soon,'' said FCC
spokeswoman Joy Howell.
</P>
<P>
   SBC spokesman Matt Miller said the company had not been notified
of any decision.
</P>
<P>
   SBC's application has been bolstered by support from the Justice
Department and Texas state regulators. Although the FCC has the
final word, it must give weight to both evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook for the application seemed particularly favorable
since the Justice Department gave its recommendation. It marked the
first time the department has backed a Bell company's attempt to
offer long-distance service within its local calling region.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department originally recommended that SBC's
application, filed at the beginning of this year, be denied. Bell
companies must satisfy a 14-point checklist meant to ensure their
market is open to rivals before they get approval to offer
long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department supported the application after it said
the company provided data showing it improved handling rivals'
requests to use its lines for high-speed Internet service. SBC also
improved the processing of orders to switch local phone customers
to competitors, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 telecommunications law sought to increase competition
in local markets by allowing Bell companies to offer long-distance
service if they opened local service to competitors. The approval
would be another step toward that goal.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic became the first company to secure FCC permission
to offer its local customers long-distance calling last year,
earning that right in New York state.

<HEADLINE> Richardson Dismisses Calls To Resign  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson dismissed
calls for his resignation Friday as politics and said he will
''absolutely not'' step down over the security lapses at the Los
Alamos weapons lab.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson has come under intense pressure from some members of
Congress over the two-month disappearance of two computer drives
containing nuclear secrets at Los Alamos, the lab in New Mexico
that has been embroiled in a controversy over security for much of
the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed on NBC's ''Today,'' Richardson said the FBI has yet
to finish its examination of the two computer drives, which
vanished from a vault and two months later were discovered behind a
copying machine in an area already searched.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson didn't learn of the incident for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The incident, coming after repeated assurances that security
improvements were keeping nuclear materials safe, prompted Sen.
Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, and other GOP lawmakers to call for Richardson's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Friday about those demands, Richardson dismissed them as
political rhetoric. ''There's been politics involved,'' he said in
the NBC interview from Richland, Wash., where he flew Thursday for
a firsthand view of wildfires that threatened the Hanford nuclear
weapons site.
</P>
<P>
   ''Absolutely not,'' Richardson replied when asked if he has any
plans to resign. ''I don't walk away from a fight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, although expressing deep concerns about the
security problems at Los Alamos, has repeatedly supported
Richardson and has said he continues to have confidence in him.
</P>
<P>
   On another subject causing concern for the White House,
Richardson said it was a ''good sign'' that gas prices in the
Midwest have dropped in recent days from their record high levels,
but that prices don't appear to be dropping elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   He attributed part of that to a 4 percent increase in demand
this July Fourth weekend as thousands of travelers hit the
highways. Still, he said oil companies have not explained the steep
price spikes for gasoline, especially the increases in the Midwest
in the cost of cleaner-burning gasoline required in areas with
severe summertime smog.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson again said no evidence has been discovered so far to
suggest espionage was involved in the disappearance of the two Los
Alamos hard drives, which contain highly technical information on
how to dismantle an array of U.S. nuclear devices and intelligence
about some foreign nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The drives, used by a nuclear emergency response team, are
believed to have last been seen in a vault in the highly secured
''X Division'' at Los Alamos in late March. They were discovered
not far from the vault behind a copying machine on June 16 and are
being examined by the FBI to determine if any of the information
had been compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said it does not appear the devices ever left the
X-Division complex, where Los Alamos scientists do their top-secret
nuclear weapons work. He said most likely ''somebody misplaced the
material and then covered up.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Richardson gave assurance that the highly radioactive
nuclear wastes, including plutonium, stored in aging gravel-covered
underground tanks at the Hanford site are safe from the fire, which
was being contained Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The fire scorched nearly half the Hanford nuclear reservation
and 20 homes as it crept within two miles of some of the area where
the nuclear wastes are located. Fire officials said Friday they
were in the process of mopping up the blaze.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Bob Hope has returned to his Toluca Lake
estate and is doing well a month after emergency hospitalization
for gastrointestinal bleeding, his daughter said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He seems to be enjoying being back in town and is doing
well,'' Linda Hope said Thursday when asked about her 97-year-old
father. Hope spokesman Ward Grant was on vacation and there were no
other details.
</P>
<P>
   Hope and his wife, Dolores, were at their desert home 100 miles
east of Los Angeles on June 1 when he fell ill and was taken to
Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage. He was released a week
later.
</P>
<P>
   The Hopes remained in the desert for another week while
renovations were completed on their home in Toluca Lake, a San
Fernando Valley hamlet behind Universal Studios Hollywood.

<P>
   ORANGE PARK, Fla. (AP) -- The graves of two members of the
Southern rock group Lynyrd Skynyrd have been vandalized, Clay
County authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Police called to Jacksonville Memory Gardens early Thursday
found the damaged graves of Ronnie Van Zant and Steve Gaines, who
were killed when the band's airplane crashed Oct. 20, 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Van Zant's casket was pulled from a tomb to the ground,
sheriff's department spokeswoman Mary Justino said. His remains
were believed to be intact, but Justino said the cremated remains
of Gaines had been spilled and then recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The disturbed remains have been taken to a mortuary while family
members decide what they want to do with them, Justino said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They just couldn't understand why someone would do this,'' she
said.

<HEADLINE> Sharon Stone Appears With Dalai Lama  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Sharon Stone, an outspoken advocate for the
Tibetan cause, appeared onstage with the Dalai Lama after the
dedication of a rare Tibetan mandala.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the goal of this mandala to bring peace to the hearts of
the worldwide community,'' Stone said Thursday to an audience of
more than 1,000 who gathered at Forest Lawn Memorial Park to see
the mandala and hear the teachings of the exiled Tibetan spiritual
leader.
</P>
<P>
   The 42-year old actress, who has appeared in more than 40 films,
including ''Basic Instinct'' and ''Casino,'' laughed and joked with
the audience before leading a question-and-answer session.
</P>
<P>
   Created by artist Pema Namdol Thaye, the mandala is a work that
represents a Tibetan art form said to be nearly extinct.
</P>
<P>
   The piece is still a work in progress and should be completed in
October. Thaye, author of the book ''Tibetan Art,'' is one of only
a handful of artists in the world still working in that style.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Open Mixed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened mixed Friday as more companies
warned of disappointing earnings, raising fears that rising
interest rates and the slowing economy are eating away at corporate
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the start of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 44.20 at 10,353.84, adding to
Thursday's 129-point drop.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 3.06 at 1,439.33, and the Nasdaq composite index was
up 16.24 at 3,893.47.
</P>
<P>
   More evidence of a slowing economy came Friday when the Commerce
Department reported that Americans' incomes in May rose twice as
fast as their spending, pushing the nation's personal savings rate
up to its highest level since the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second month in a row in which incomes rose faster
than spending and suggested that consumers may be cooling off the
buying binge of the last year. That's important because consumer
spending accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity.
</P>
<P>
   Investors continue to look for signs that the economy will cool
off to a more sustainable growth rate to put a lid on inflationary
pressures and keep the Federal Reserve from boosting interest rates
at its August meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised short-term rates six times in the past year
in an effort to keep inflation under control. On Wednesday, while
noting inflation risks continue in the economy, the Fed left
interest rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Investors worry that additional interest rate hikes will slow
the economy to the point that corporate profits suffer. American
Financial Group Inc. warned late Thursday that its second-quarter
earnings would fall below expectations. It stock was down $1.063 at

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Friday as more companies
warned of disappointing earnings, raising fears that rising
interest rates and the slowing economy are eating away at corporate
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Some strength in technology stocks helped break some of the
early slide.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 51.39 at 10,346.68, adding to
Thursday's 129-point drop.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 2.12 at 1,440.27, and the Nasdaq composite index was
up 22.05 at 3,899.28.
</P>
<P>
   More evidence of a slowing economy came Friday when the Commerce
Department reported that Americans' incomes in May rose twice as
fast as their spending, pushing the nation's personal savings rate
up to its highest level since the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second month in a row in which incomes rose faster
than spending and suggested that consumers may be backing away from
their buying binge of the last year. That's important because
consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity.
</P>
<P>
   Investors continue to look for signs that the economy will cool
off to a more sustainable growth rate to put a lid on inflationary
pressures and keep the Federal Reserve from boosting interest rates
at its August meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised short-term rates six times in the past year
in an effort to keep inflation under control. On Wednesday, while
noting inflation risks continue in the economy, the Fed left
interest rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Investors worry that additional interest rate hikes will slow
the economy to the point that corporate profits suffer. In the last
few days, dozens of companies have warned of disappointing profits.
</P>
<P>
   The latest was American Financial Group Inc., which was down
43.75 cents to $26.50 after announcing that its second-quarter
earnings would fall below expectations.
</P>
<P>
   There was scattered strength among technology stocks. JDS
Uniphase rose $2.50 to $118.875 after being added to PaineWebber's
''Highlighted Stocks'' list. Other shares moving higher included
Rambus, which rose $3.0625 to $104, and Oracle, which gained $1 to
$81.875.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 117.68 million
shares, down from Thursday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was expected to remain choppy Friday, the final day of
the second quarter and the day before a long weekend for many
investors who plan to skip Monday's abbreviated trading session.
U.S. financial markets will close three hours early Monday and shut
down all of Tuesday for Independence Day.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index down 0.38 at 512.20.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.37 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.28 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.55 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up
0.55 percent.

<HEADLINE> Experimental Impotence Drug Blocked  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Faced with serious safety questions, the maker
of the experimental impotence drug Uprima withdrew its application
for government approval Friday, leaving its fate in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   Uprima once was expected to become the first real competitor for
the famous blue impotence pill Viagra, after advisers to the Food
and Drug Administration recommended in April that Uprima be sold.
</P>
<P>
   But those same advisers warned the drug can cause a serious side
effect: One in 30 men who tested the optimal dose fainted or
suffered severe low blood pressure. One man crashed his car;
another fell and fractured his skull.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the FDA's advisers bluntly warned that if Uprima is
ever sold, this side effect will kill some people.
</P>
<P>
   Today was the FDA's deadline to decide Uprima's fate: let it
sell with strong warnings on how men can minimize the risk, like
the advisers suggested; reject it; or require more safety studies.
</P>
<P>
   But before the government formally rendered a decision,
manufacturer TAP Pharmaceuticals announced it was withdrawing
Uprima's FDA application, a sign the company expected rejection.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew they had questions,'' acknowledged TAP spokeswoman Kim
Modory.
</P>
<P>
   TAP stressed, however, that it believes Uprima is effective and
thus it plans to again seek FDA approval after new data from
clinical trials becomes available later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''TAP is very committed to patient care, and it is our hope that
by taking the extra time to submit additional data, TAP will be
able to provide a treatment with an even stronger product
profile,'' TAP president Thomas Watkins said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer advocate Dr. Sidney Wolfe of Public Citizen called
it ''inconceivable'' that additional study results would disprove
Uprima's danger.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this company is smart it will permanently kill this drug,''
he said. ''This drug is just unacceptably dangerous and barely
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Viagra became a huge seller when, in 1998, it became the only
oral treatment for the impotence believed to afflict some 30
million men. But many men aren't helped by Viagra; hence interest
in Uprima.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra has killed some men. Its big risk is a deadly interaction
when taken by men using nitrate-containing heart medicine; others
had heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   TAP, a joint venture between Abbott Laboratories and Takeda
Pharmaceuticals, said in studies of 3,000 Uprima patients, no one
died or had heart attacks. Data recently submitted to FDA shows 0.4
percent of Uprima users fainted, Modory said.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra increases blood flow in the penis, while Uprima, in
contrast, increases levels of a brain chemical thought important
for causing erections.

<HEADLINE> Biotech Crops Still Popular  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farmers planted less genetically engineered
corn this year, but biotech varieties of cotton and soybeans are as
popular as ever despite the controversy over gene-altered crops,
the government reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers are planting 19.9 million acres of gene-altered corn
this year, down from about 25 million acres last year, according to
a survey of farmers by the Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
   Some farmers are worried about being able to sell gene-altered
corn in overseas markets, while other growers planted less biotech
seed because they aren't worried about insect infestations,
analysts say. The most popular, and most controversial, type of
biotech corn is genetically modified to kill an insect pest.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last year these guys planted all these things thinking they
would have a good or premium market, and they experienced the
opposite,'' said Bill Biedermann, director of research for
Allendale Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Plantings of biotech cotton, a crop that's grown for both fiber
and vegetable oil, are up sharply this year, according to the USDA
survey.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 61 percent of this year's crop, or about 9.5
million acres, is genetically engineered, compared to 8.2 million
acres last year, or 55 percent of the 1999 crop.
</P>
<P>
   About 40.2 million acres of genetically engineered soybeans have
been planted this year, or 54 percent of the total crop, according
to the farmer survey.
</P>
<P>
   The department does not have a comparable estimate for last
year. However, the Biotechnology Industry Organization has
estimated, based on seed sales, that 35 million acres of
genetically engineered soybeans were grown in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The gene-altered soybeans are designed to be used with a popular
and powerful herbicide known as Roundup. Farmers say they like the
crop because it dramatically reduces their field work. Weeds are a
major problem in growing soybeans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody is so excited about them, especially this year,''
because heavy rains have caused more weeds to grow, said
Biedermann. He said farmers had no problems selling biotech
soybeans last year.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers would have planted even more of the crop this year had
seed companies been able to keep up with demand, said Michael
Phillips, executive director of food and agriculture for the
industry group.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Margulis, an anti-biotech activist with the
environmental group Greenpeace, said the USDA survey shows that
farmer interest in biotechnology is leveling off.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in biotech corn acreage ''is clearly because of the
export problems. Soybean growers are starting to feel that but
haven't felt it as much,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Labor Standards Plan Advances  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is taking another
step toward making good on a promise Vice President Al Gore made to
labor unions three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The White House on Thursday released a revised proposal for
regulations that would bar companies from doing business with the
federal government if there is strong evidence they aren't
complying with labor, tax, environmental or consumer protection
laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''Private businesses routinely take into account a potential
suppliers record of performance, reputation and integrity before
deciding to do business with them -- so should the federal
government,'' said a statement from the White House Office of
Management and Budget.
</P>
<P>
   Gore first promised the new government contracting rules in
February 1997 during a speech at an AFL-CIO meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want to do business with the federal government you had
better maintain a safe workplace and respect civil, human and union
rights,'' he said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Republican senators raised strong objections, however,
threatening to block the 1997 confirmation of Labor Secretary
Alexis Herman over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   It did not resurface until last summer, when the White House
issued a formal written proposal. That also met with strenuous
protests from the GOP and business groups, who have called it a
''blacklisting'' threat.
</P>
<P>
   The new, modified version comes as Gore is trying to solidify
union support for his presidential campaign after a series of
actions that have angered labor leaders. Among them: Gore's support
for a U.S.-China trade deal and his decision to hire President
Clinton's chief Capitol Hill lobbyist for the deal, Commerce
Secretary William Daley, as his new campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers said changes in the proposal were
insufficient and accused the administration of political pandering.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has taken Vice President Gore three years to deliver on his
1997 promise to the AFL-CIO leadership, and he has delivered just
as the campaign for president begins to hit full stride,'' said
House Workforce Committee Chairman Bill Goodling, R-Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has long denied any political motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ''This policy is obviously good for taxpayers and working
families,'' said Gore campaign spokesman Doug Hattaway. ''It's the
Republicans on Capitol Hill who want to politicize everything under
the sun.''
</P>
<P>
   The modified proposal more explicitly delineates the corporate
wrongdoing federal contracting officers could consider, and would
require companies that are disqualified from competition to be
notified and allowed to challenge that determination before a
contract is awarded.
</P>
<P>
   It still includes provisions that would bar federal contractors
from billing the government for expenses associated with activities
intended to influence workers' decisions to unionize, such as
hiring legal consultants or printing pamphlets.
</P>
<P>
   The revised proposal will be open for public comment for 60 days
before it is finalized, the administration said.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Friday, with blue-chip shares
coming under selling pressure while a surge in semiconductor stocks
lifted the technology sector higher.
</P>
<P>
   In late morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 52.36 at 10,345.71, adding to Thursday's 129-point
drop.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 2.37 at 1,444.76 and the Nasdaq composite index was up
54.34 at 3,931.57.
</P>
<P>
   Investors got mixed news on Friday concerning the strength of
the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Commerce Department reported that Americans' incomes
in May rose twice as fast as their spending, pushing the nation's
personal savings rate up to its highest level since the start of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second month in a row in which incomes rose faster

consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity.
</P>
<P>
   Later Friday came a conflicting report from Purchasing
Management Association of Chicago, which said its index of business
activity in the Midwest rose a higher-than-expected 56.8 in June,
up from 53.9 in May. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the
manufacturing sector; the Chicago report is considered a precursor
of the national purchasing managers report, due out Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Investors continue to look for signs that the economy will cool
off to a more sustainable growth rate to put a lid on inflationary
pressures and keep the Federal Reserve from boosting interest rates

</P>
<P>
   The latest was insurer American Financial Group, whose stock
fell 6.25 cents to $27 after announcing that its second-quarter
earnings would fall below expectations. Also anticipating
lower-than-expected earnings was Hooper Holmes, which conducts
physicals for life insurers. Its stock fell $2 to $8.125.
</P>
<P>
   Computer chip stocks moved higher after the Semiconductor
Industry Association said worldwide chip sales reached an all-time
high of $15.8 billion in May, up 39.8 percent from $11.3 billion a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   That helped pushed Rambus up $6.781 to $107.718 and Motorola up
87.5 cents to $30.188.
</P>
<P>
   JDS Uniphase rose $3.814 to $120.188 after being added to

<HEADLINE> Sen. Addresses Genetic Bias Concerns  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate rejection of broad new workplace and
insurance protections against genetic discrimination, including a
right to sue, signals a go-slow approach in Congress to the
dilemmas posed by the decoding of the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   ''This issue deserves and requires a thorough discussion in its
own forum,'' Sen. Jim Jeffords, R-Vt., said, while acknowledging
that ''we need to guard genetic privacy and guard against genetic
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords, chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and
Pensions Committee, promised comprehensive hearings on genetics
bias just before the Senate voted 54-44 along party lines Thursday
to defeat a Democratic measure that would have enacted a host of
new privacy protections.
</P>
<P>
   The debate followed this week's landmark announcement that
public and private researchers had essentially deciphered the
entire human genetic code, or genome. The breakthrough opens a new
universe of possibilities in preventative medicine but also raises
fears that private health information could be used to discriminate
against people prone to certain diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation the Senate rejected would have prohibited
employers from using genetic information in hiring and workplace
promotion or salaries. It also would have prevented insurance
companies from basing coverage or premiums on genetic information
and from requiring genetic tests to get coverage, and would have
permitted an individual to take discrimination claims to court.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot take one step forward in science and two steps
backward in civil rights,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.D. ''Discrimination based on genetic factors is just
as unacceptable as that based on race, national origin, religion,
sex or disability.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Senate opted by a 58-40 vote for Jeffords'
alternative setting up similar restrictions on use of genetic
information by insurance companies and group health plans but doing
nothing on workplace discrimination or a right to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the Democratic approach was hasty and would
result in numerous court claims.
</P>
<P>
   ''This isn't the right way to do it,'' said Sen. Mike Enzi,
R-Wyo. ''This becomes a turnstile for trial attorneys.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate came on amendments to the annual appropriations bill
that funds the departments of Labor, Education and Health and Human
Services. President Clinton has threatened to veto the $352 billion
spending bill -- passed by the Senate Friday on a 52-43 vote --
because of its spending levels and other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate did approve two competing ''lockbox'' provisions
aimed at preventing budget surpluses in the Medicare program from
being used for spending or tax cuts, which is similar to
legislation already passed by the House. Clinton embraced the
Democratic version.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before we make any other major budget decisions this year, we
should agree that Medicare funds should not be used to finance tax
cuts or other spending,'' the president said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also attached legislation -- criticized by Democrats
-- giving 56 million people limited new medical rights, such as
access to emergency room care and to out-of-network physicians.
People also would have a restricted right to sue their HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton announced before the overall spending bill even
reached the Senate floor that he would veto it, contending it would
not reduce classroom sizes by providing money he wants to hire
100,000 new teachers and would not guarantee $1.3 billion in loans
and grants to repair crumbling schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate last week also added another provision opposed by the
administration that would block Labor Department rules giving
workers new protections against repetitive motion injuries.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 4577.

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Limited Patient Rights  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans are on record for the first
time in favor of giving patients a limited right to sue HMOs, but
what they call a major concession Democrats dismiss as mere
political cover in the run-up to the fall elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''We offered a significant compromise proposal'' on several
contested points in patient rights legislation, Sen. Don Nickles.,
R-Okla., said Thursday night as Republicans maneuvered their plan
past Democrats on a 51-47 vote.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., offered a swift rebuttal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any Republican who goes back to their state and tries to sell
this ... has a thick skin and a safe seat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The provision was attached to a $352 billion measure financing
the departments of Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services
next year, which the Senate approved Friday by 52-43. The White
House has said President Clinton will veto the bill because the
measure provides less than he has proposed for hiring teachers,
social services and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan provides several guarantees, including
access to emergency room care, out-of-network physicians and
specialists for an estimated 56 million insured individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, patients also would be permitted to file
suit in federal court against HMOs that improperly denied care, as
determined by an independent reviewer.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the lawsuit provision would apply to 131
million insured people who could seek unlimited economic damages
and up to $350,000 in compensatory damages. Punitive damages would
be barred, as would class-action lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the GOP proposal didn't go nearly far enough, and
forced a vote on a proposal requiring that any protections cover
all Americans with insurance -- a group far larger than covered by
the GOP measure.
</P>
<P>
   It was rejected, though, on a vote of 51-47, as Republicans said
Democrats were proposing health insurance run by the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of people who don't want a national health
care plan,'' said Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo. ''And I can tell you that
if I even considered one, they wouldn't send me back here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., derided the Republican approach
as ''Honey, I shrunk the plan,'' and taunted GOP lawmakers to say
straight out that they oppose patient protection legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuvering did little to clarify the fate of patients
rights legislation, which has emerged as a key election-year issue.
</P>
<P>
   House-passed legislation grants more extensive protections to
more Americans than either a Senate-passed bill from last year or
the proposal adopted Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   And House Republicans who broke ranks on the bill remained
adamant during the day that nothing less than protections for all
Americans with insurance would suffice. Punctuating that point,
Rep. Charles Norwood, R-Ga. issued a written statement shortly
after the Senate voted, saying, ''this monstrosity is dead on
arrival in the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Formal compromise talks between Republicans and Democrats are
moribund, and an effort last week by House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., to bring Norwood and Senate Republicans together on a
compromise also failed.
</P>
<P>
   All 51 votes in favor of the Republican measure were cast by GOP
senators. Opposed were 43 Democrats, joined by Republicans Arlen
Specter of Pennsylvania, Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island,John McCain
of Arizona and Peter Fitzgerald of Illinois.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Spending Bill Delayed in Senate  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Though its passage seems assured, an $11.2
billion emergency measure for Colombia, the Pentagon and victims of
domestic disasters hit some turbulence Friday as a pair of senators
unhappy with the bill's spending threatened to delay it.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said the
measure was too costly and too laden with lawmakers' home-district
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we don't do something here, there will be no limits on
spending whatsoever,'' Gramm said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   With Congress' weeklong July Fourth recess about to begin,
Senate leaders were looking for a way around the problem. They were
eager to approve the bill and ship money to the military, which has
warned of scaled-back operations beginning in July unless it can
get the funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to get it done,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   The House endorsed the bill Thursday by 306-110.
</P>
<P>
   The lopsided margin belied the bill's stop-and-start journey
through Congress, which began in February when President Clinton
asked for $5.2 billion. In the end, most members could not resist
the election-year largesse it contained for the Long Island Sound's
struggling lobster industry, law enforcement along the
Arizona-Mexico border, and much in between.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that the bill ''will make our nation safer and more
secure,'' Clinton indicated that he stood ready to sign it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has been four months since I first sent this request to
Capitol Hill, and the needs are all the greater today,'' he said
after the House vote.
</P>
<P>
   The highest profile item was $1.3 billion to help Colombia's
government prevail in its four-decade conflict against drug
traffickers and their heavily armed left- and right-wing allies.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., pushed
hard for the money, which they argue will help stem the flow of
cocaine and heroin from Colombia. The South American country
supplies more than 80 percent of the cocaine used in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ''This Colombian aid package is an investment in our future -- a
future free from the scourge of drugs,'' Hastert said after the
vote
</P>
<P>
   Their combined drive for the money overwhelmed opposition by
members of both parties. Opponents cited allegations of Colombian
human rights abuses, fear of U.S. involvement in an unwinnable,
four-decade-long conflict, and a preference to use the money for
drug prevention programs at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''A profound mistake,'' is how Rep. David Obey, D-Wis.,
described the Colombian aid.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the aid is to provide the Colombians with 60 Blackhawk
and Huey helicopters, train and equip Colombian military and
national police battalions, and for intelligence activity.
Officials envision retaking portions of southern Colombia that the
rebels control, and fumigating jungle coca fields.
</P>
<P>
   There would also be money for human rights programs in Colombia,
for Bolivia, Ecuador and other nearby countries, and for U.S.
aircraft performing anti-drug surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also contained $2 billion to refill Pentagon accounts
drained to pay for the 5,700 U.S. troops in the NATO peacekeeping
team in Kosovo. There was also $4.4 billion more for fuel, health
care and other Pentagon programs -- including $40 million in for
Vieques, Puerto Rico, site of the Navy's controversial bombing
range.
</P>
<P>
   There was also $661 million to help New Mexico rebuild from the
blazes that ravaged Los Alamos and other communities; $350 million
for fighting other wildfires; about $360 million to help North
Carolina and other states recover from last September's Hurricane
Floyd and other agricultural problems; and $600 million to help
low-income families pay their utility bills.
</P>
<P>
   In a setback for environmentalists and the administration,
conservatives won language blocking forthcoming Environmental
Protection Agency rules aimed at reducing industrial and
agricultural run-off into polluted streams and lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Money for lawmaker's pet projects, however, knew no political
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   There was $110 million for a new Great Lakes icebreaker to be
based in Wisconsin, home state of the House Appropriations
Committee's top Democrat, Obey.
</P>
<P>
   Two U.S. Senate candidates -- Reps. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., and Bob
Franks, R-N.J. -- won projects to boast about. Lazio was trumpeting
$6 million for homeless shelters nationwide, part of which was
going for a veterans' shelter in Buffalo, N.Y. Franks won $41
million for New Jersey communities damaged by floods spawned by
last September's Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   There was also money for a bicycle path in the northern Virginia
district of Rep. James Moran, D-Va.; to repair a federal
hurricane-chaser plane based in the Tampa district of House
Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla.; to continue
work on a sealife institute in Seward, Alaska, home state of Senate
Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency money was attached to a routine $8.8 billion
measure financing military construction projects for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is HR4425.

<HEADLINE> Dow Slips 29; Nasdaq Gains 52  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Friday, with worries over
corporate earnings and rising interest rate hurting blue-chip
shares while a surge in semiconductor stocks lifted the technology
sector.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 29.03 at 10,369.04, adding to Thursday's 129-point
drop.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 2.99 at 1,445.38 and the Nasdaq composite index was up
52.25 at 3,929.48.
</P>
<P>
   Investors got mixed news on Friday concerning the strength of
the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Commerce Department reported that Americans' incomes
in May rose twice as fast as their spending, pushing the nation's
personal savings rate up to its highest level since the start of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second month in a row in which incomes rose faster
than spending and suggested that consumers may be backing away from
their buying binge of the last year. That's important because
consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity.
</P>
<P>
   Later Friday came a conflicting report from Purchasing
Management Association of Chicago, which said its index of business
activity in the Midwest rose a higher-than-expected 56.8 in June,
up from 53.9 in May. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the
manufacturing sector; the Chicago report is considered a precursor
of the national purchasing managers report, due out Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Investors continue to look for signs that the economy will cool
off to a more sustainable growth rate to put a lid on inflationary
pressures and keep the Federal Reserve from boosting interest rates
at its August meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised short-term rates six times in the past year
in an effort to keep inflation under control. On Wednesday, while
noting inflation risks continue in the economy, the Fed left
interest rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Investors worry that additional interest rate hikes will slow
the economy to the point that corporate profits suffer. In the last
few days, dozens of companies have warned of disappointing profits.
</P>
<P>
   The latest was insurer American Financial Group, whose stock
fell 6.25 cents to $27 after announcing that its second-quarter
earnings would fall below expectations. Also anticipating
lower-than-expected earnings was Hooper Holmes, which conducts
physicals for life insurers. Its stock fell $1.813 to $8.313.
</P>
<P>
   ''Inflation remains the key to this market, but corporate
earnings right now are the center stage,'' said Alan Ackerman,
senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. ''We will start seeing a
lot of earnings in the next few weeks. The disappointments will be
a disaster and good earnings will help stocks hold or move to
higher levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer chip stocks moved higher after the Semiconductor
Industry Association said worldwide chip sales reached an all-time
high of $15.8 billion in May, up 39.8 percent from $11.3 billion a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   That helped pushed Rambus up $4.75 to $105.688 and Motorola up
93.75 cents to $30.25.
</P>
<P>
   JDS Uniphase rose $3.50 to $119.875 after being added to
PaineWebber's ''Highlighted Stocks'' list.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 415.11 million
shares, down from 458.39 million shares on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was expected to remain choppy Friday, the final day of
the second quarter and the day before a long weekend for many
investors who plan to skip Monday's abbreviated trading session.
U.S. financial markets will close three hours early Monday and shut
down all of Tuesday for Independence Day.

<HEADLINE> FAA, Customs To Check for Fireworks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal inspectors will be screening airline
passengers' baggage for fireworks over the holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
   All types of fireworks are banned from aircraft, either in
checked or carry-on bags.
</P>
<P>
   The inspections will be handled by agents of the Federal
Aviation Administration and Customs Service.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even the smallest sparklers could be deadly if they ignited
during flight, and they are all strictly prohibited,'' said Cathal
L. Flynn, associate FAA administrator for security.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA said bags will be selected at random for screening at
airports across the country. No delays are expected due to the
increased scrutiny, but the FAA reminded passengers that they
should arrive at least one hour early for domestic flights and two
hours early for international flights.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said fireworks are a concern around Independence Day
every year since most of the annual sales of these goods take place
in June and July. Persons caught with fireworks on aircraft can be
subject to fines and jail time.

<HEADLINE> FBI Trains New Agents on Holocaust  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI has begun teaching its new agents how
a failure by police to protect citizen rights helped produce the
Holocaust in which 6 million Jews, as well as other minorities and
political dissidents were murdered by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   The training segment for agents-to-be at the FBI Academy began
last month and was announced Friday by FBI Director Louis J. Freeh;
Sara J. Bloomfield, director of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum
and Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation
League.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do this early on in their training ... to remind them of
the horror and evil which can result from not just a government,
but particularly law enforcement, abandoning its mission to protect
people and becoming the engine of oppression,'' Freeh said.
</P>
<P>
   The trainees are given a guided tour of the Holocaust Museum
here and instruction about Adolf Hitler's use of the police in
Germany in the 1930s and 1940s to round up Jews, political
opponents and other targeted groups.
</P>
<P>
   There is a classroom discussion and then trainees must write an
essay on the question: ''Of what relevance is this history to you
as a human being and a law enforcement official?''
</P>
<P>
   After the first session, one student wrote, ''It has taught me
that making sure our Constitution is strictly followed should be a
number one priority throughout my career.'' Another said: ''It will
help me remember my greatest duty to preserve human life and
protect the civil rights of every man, woman and child.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloomfield, the museum director, said, ''Much of the Holocaust
was perpetrated or supported by trained professionals who were
'doing their job.' The museum's program with the FBI challenges law
enforcement agents to examine the moral dimensions of their
professions.''
</P>
<P>
   The topic of police complicity in the Holocaust has been a
concern of Freeh's for some time. In 1994, over objections from the
State Department and the U.S. ambassador to Poland, Freeh visited
the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz during a European trip and gave a
speech at Jagellonian University in nearby Krakow, Poland, on the
police role in Hitler's oppression.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh researched and wrote the speech himself with help from
Nobel laureate and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must be morally responsible for what we do,'' Freeh said
Friday. ''We have to understand and protect not just the people we
serve, but the moral and ethical values and human dignities that
are so important to us all.''
</P>
<P>
   Foxman applauded the FBI's commitment to ''law enforcement's
critical role as defenders of the Constitution and guardians of
individual rights'' and said the training ''has tremendous
potential to impact the next generation of law enforcement
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   At its International Law Enforcement Academy in Budapest,
Hungary, the FBI has taught a course in human dignity to more than
1,000 police officers from former communist countries.

<HEADLINE> Study Examines Red Wine Antioxidant  </HEADLINE>
By GARY D. ROBERTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Researchers believe they have unlocked the
mystery of how an antioxidant found in grapes and red wine fights
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   A study published Friday concludes that the compound
resveratrol, which acts like an antibiotic to protect grapes from
fungus, may turn off a protein that guards cancer cells from
cancer-fighting therapies such as chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   The research may one day allow the compound itself to be used in
cancer prevention and treatment, said Minnie Holmes-McNary, a
nutritional biologist at the University of North Carolina's medical
school in Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ''The benefit is that it certainly provides an open door for
potential therapies,'' said Holmes-McNary, the study's lead author.
That may include taking a pill similar to a vitamin supplement.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of drinking a glass of red wine have been touted
over the past decade after the discovery of the ''French paradox''
-- that the French had low rates of heart disease despite
high-cholesterol diets. Studies have shown the key may be the glass
or two of red table wine at dinner.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, researchers found that resveratrol kept cells
from turning cancerous and stopped the spread of malignancies.
Resveratrol also blocked cell inflammation, which is linked to
arthritis and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Resveratrol can be found in dozens of foods, including
mulberries and peanuts. All wines have some resveratrol, but red
wine seems to be its richest source.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes-McNary and co-author Albert Baldwin Jr. at the medical
school's Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center wanted to know how
resveratrol kills cancer cells. Their findings were published in
the July issue of the journal Cancer Research.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers used previous research by Baldwin and others
that determined the protein called NF-kappa B enabled tumor cells
to survive even chemotherapy. When NF-kappa B is blocked in mice --
as observed last year in a study -- the cancer cells were eradicated
by the chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes-McNary and Baldwin tested how cultured human and animal
tumor cells reacted to the resveratrol, learning that it
effectively turned off the NF-kappa B cancer gene. Untreated tumors
continued to thrive, Holmes-McNary said.
</P>
<P>
   Discovering the mechanisms of resveratrol is important to
developing the compound as a cancer-preventive agent for humans,
said John Pezzuto, a University of Illinois at Chicago researcher
who first reported resveratrol's link to red wine and fighting
cancer in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good contribution,'' Pezzuto said of the study. ''It
seems like there are multiple mechanisms. In the end, there may be
a common thread to all of them. It's like we're laying down pieces
of the puzzle. This is one of those pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health and the
North Carolina chapter of the American Heart Association, also
found muscadine wines contain up to seven times more resveratrol
than regular wines.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Still Like Biotech Crops  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farmers aren't giving up on genetically
engineered crops despite misgivings of some consumers. Producers
planted less biotech corn this year, but they're growing more
gene-altered soybeans and cotton than ever, a government survey
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers are planting 19.9 million acres of altered corn this
year, down from about 25 million acres last year, according to the
Agriculture Department survey of farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Some farmers worry about being able to sell gene-altered corn in
Europe and other overseas markets, and others planted less biotech
seed because they aren't so worried about insect infestations this
year, analysts said. The most popular and most controversial type
of biotech corn is genetically modified to kill a major pest, the
European corn borer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last year these guys planted all these things thinking they
would have a good or premium market, and they experienced the
opposite,'' said commodity analyst Bill Biedermann of the
agricultural researchers Allendale Inc.
</P>
<P>
   About 40.2 million acres of genetically engineered soybeans have
been planted this year, or 54 percent of the total crop, according
to the farmer survey.
</P>
<P>
   The department does not have a comparable estimate for last
year. The Biotechnology Industry Organization has estimated, based
on seed sales, that 35 million acres of genetically engineered
soybeans were grown in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The soybeans are immune to Monsanto Co.'s powerful Roundup
herbicide, making it easier for farmers to control yield-robbing
weeds.
</P>
<P>
   South Dakota farmer David Price started growing the crop two
years ago and said he won't switch back to conventional seeds so
long as he has a market for the genetically modified variety.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like having a two-wheel-drive pickup. When that's all you
had it was fine, but when you drive a four-wheel-drive, and you
have to go back to a two-wheel-drive, it's like the end of the
world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Plantings of biotech cotton, a crop that's grown for both fiber
and vegetable oil, also are up sharply this year, the USDA survey
found.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 61 percent of this year's crop, or about 9.5
million acres, is genetically engineered, compared with 8.2 million
acres last year, or 55 percent of the 1999 crop. Some of the
gene-altered cotton is toxic to insects, some is Roundup-tolerant,
and some is both.
</P>
<P>
   The acreage estimates of both biotech cotton and soybean are
higher than what farmers had indicated they would plant in a USDA
survey done earlier in the year. The corn estimate is about the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans and Japanese have rejected biotech food, and polls
indicate that support for the crops among American consumers has
slipped over the past year. A few U.S. companies are turning down
some gene-altered commodities, including Frito-Lay Inc. and
McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators say the crops, which caught on with farmers
in the late 1990s, are safe for humans and the environment.
Opponents say too little is known about it.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Margulis, an anti-biotech activist with the
environmental group Greenpeace, said the USDA survey shows that
farmer interest in biotechnology is leveling off.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in biotech corn acreage ''is clearly because of the
export problems. Soybean growers are starting to feel that but
haven't felt it as much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Growing gene-altered soybeans can actually cost farmers more
than conventional varieties. The seed costs more and sometimes
yields less, but weeds can be such a problem in growing soybeans
that farmers say the extra expense is worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody is so excited about them, especially this year,''
because heavy rains in parts of the Midwest have caused more weeds
to grow, said Biedermann. He predicted demand for the seed will be
greater next year.

   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Democratic state Comptroller H. Carl McCall
may not be the drunk-with-ambition candidate for governor that
those close to the current governor, Republican George Pataki, are
working hard to portray him as.
</P>
<P>
   But McCall is doing many of the things candidates tend to do two
years or so out from a gubernatorial election they look likely to
jump into.
</P>
<P>
   That includes making sure those groups they count on to form
their core support stay healthy, happy and loyal.
</P>
<P>
   Thus came a letter from McCall personally addressed to some
260,000 New York's local and state government retirees last week
informing them of what most already knew - that the state
Legislature and governor agreed in June to allow the retirees to
share in more of the assets of the public employees' pension funds
in New York. Perhaps just as important to pensioners, the state
will institute a recurring system of annual cost-of-living
increases.
</P>
<P>
   For an 82-year-old school custodian who retired in 1980, for
instance, the benefit increases taking effect on Sept. 30, 2000,
will increase his annual pension from $5,737 to $7,439. A
60-year-old teacher who retired in 1990 will see her benefits
increase from $30,210 a year to $32,196.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been fighting for this since I took office seven years
ago, but it's the retirees who deserve all the credit,'' McCall
told beneficiaries under the letterhead of the largest pension fund
he administers as comptroller, the New York State and Local
Retirement Systems.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congratulations on finally winning the good fight,'' the
letter continued. ''I am proud to have been with you during this
struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall added that retirees could expect another letter from him
this fall providing specifics of how the changes would affect their
individual pensions.
</P>
<P>
   Is this campaign material in the guise of an informational
letter to members of pension funds McCall administers?
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller's aides insisted it was not.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is not a declared candidate for anything, No. 1,'' his
chief spokesman Steven Greenberg said. ''Two, he is in the second
year of a four-year term. Third, and most importantly, this is an
important benefit change affecting 260,000 people and historically
the pension system has always written to retirees to inform them
about changes in their retirement system.''
</P>
<P>
   As sole administrator of the $127 billion pension fund, McCall
would be negligent to his fiduciary responsibilities if he did not
inform retirees about changes in their benefits, Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The retirement system paid for the mailing, Greenberg said. He
did not know how much it cost.
</P>
<P>
   Public government retirees are a solid little voting bloc in New
York and of an age - retirement age - where people tend to get to
the ballot box in large numbers on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   McCall has proven popular among retirees because he has
advocated for an automatic cost-of-living increase in their
benefits since he became comptroller. Of the 260,000 or so living
retirees from the State and Local Retirement Systems, the vast
majority continue to live in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   But their numbers would hardly be enough to swing most
elections, especially considering Pataki outdistanced his closest
challenger by more than 1 million votes in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And Pataki is sure to counter McCall's influence among the
retirees by pointing out that as governor he also favored the
cost-of-living increase and was the guiding force behind the STAR
property tax-cut program, which was put into effect for senior
citizens before other homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   These are the calculations made when the sparring starts against
a perceived political opponent, even if the election is 28 months
away.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's aides have already started to give the scripted answer
when McCall criticizes a Pataki administration agency or budget
that it is ''sad'' the Democratic comptroller is putting personal
ambition above those served by whatever program or department he is
authorized by the state constitution to examine. Often, McCall's
auditors find such mundane problems - frequently, bad computer
software or office bookkeeping practices - that it defies
explanation how his office's criticisms amounts to political
opportunism.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon declined to comment on McCall's
letter to retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at history, one could wonder why Pataki would feel
threatened by a possible challenge from a state comptroller. No
sitting comptroller won election as governor throughout the 20th
century, and polls consistently show average New Yorkers have only
a vague idea of who their comptroller is or what he does.
</P>
<P>
   But Pataki and his advisers can count, too. In 1998, McCall got
more than 2.8 million votes as he won re-election - or almost
300,000 more than Pataki received.

<HEADLINE> Justices Make History in 1999-2000  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court made its 1999-2000 term one
of history's most consequential by tackling some of America's
toughest legal and social issues. Decisions on abortion, school
prayer, grandparents' rights, states' rights, police tactics and
gay Boy Scouts captured the nation's attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not ducking,'' said Mary Cheh, a George Washington
University law professor. ''The court showed a certain fearlessness
in taking on the cases it did.''
</P>
<P>
   The conservative court, which ended Wednesday the term it began
in October, did not always reach conservative conclusions. The
justices upheld the famous Miranda warnings police must give
criminal suspects before questioning them, banned group prayers at
high school football games and struck down a state's
''partial-birth abortion'' law, perhaps dooming similar
restrictions in 30 other states.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was an amazing term that forces us to give a much more
nuanced account of the Rehnquist court,'' said Erwin Chemerinsky, a
University of Southern California law professor. ''In some regards
it is a very conservative and activist court, but it definitely has
its limits.''
</P>
<P>
   The divisive issues were reflected in the court's votes -- 20 of
the term's 73 signed decisions were reached by 5-4 votes, the
highest percentage of one-vote outcomes in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and the court's leading
conservatives, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were joined by
centrists Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy in 13 of those
20 cases.
</P>
<P>
   Among them were decisions that let the Boy Scouts ban homosexual
troop leaders, prevented rape victims from suing their attackers in
federal courts and barred the federal Food and Drug Administration
from regulating cigarettes as dangerous drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The loss for rape victims -- in which the court struck down a key
provision of the federal Violence Against Women Act -- was a states'
rights victory. Rehnquist wrote that it is up to the states, not
Congress, to choose whether to protect women in that way.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a major defeat for Congress, showing that the court has
a narrow view of congressional power under the constitutional
amendments ratified after the Civil War,'' said Yale law professor
Akhil Amar. Those amendments ensure civil rights for all citizens.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor again loomed as the court's pivotal majority-maker. She
cast only four dissenting votes in the 73 cases, compared with nine
for Kennedy, 10 for Thomas, 13 for Rehnquist and 14 for Scalia.
</P>
<P>
   The court's four more liberal justices found themselves in
dissent more often. John Paul Stevens cast 28 dissenting votes,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 22; David H. Souter, 21; and Stephen G.
Breyer, 18.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor also limited the conservative thrust of an important
church-state decision when she supplied a crucial vote for the
majority but wrote separately to voice key differences.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the court significantly lowered the figurative
wall of separation between government and religion by ruling that
taxpayer money can be used to supply computers and other
instructional materials for religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   Although O'Connor agreed with that result, she refused to join
an extraordinarily sweeping Thomas opinion that would have allowed
virtually any government subsidy of religious institutions as long
as it is not intended to further the religious mission. Rehnquist,
Scalia and Kennedy signed on with Thomas -- one vote short of a
majority.
</P>
<P>
   In one of its most closely watched decisions, the court split
6-3 to limit states' power to help grandparents and others with
close ties to children win the right to see them regularly against
parents' wishes.
</P>
<P>
   The court stopped short, however, of giving parents absolute
veto power over who gets to visit their children and left
unanswered many questions state courts face daily in visitation
battles.
</P>
<P>
   Other major decisions:
</P>
<P>
CRIMINAL JUSTICE
</P>
<P>
   --Anonymous tips to police generally do not justify an officer's
stopping, frisking and questioning people.
</P>
<P>
   --Police sometimes can pursue, stop and question people who run
away at the sight of them.
</P>
<P>
   --Federal judges should not reverse state court rulings in
criminal cases unless the rulings are found to be ''unreasonable,''
a standard that makes it far harder for defendants convicted in
state courts to get federal court help.
</P>
<P>
   --Presidential friend Webster Hubbell's guilty plea to a
misdemeanor tax charge could not stand because he was prosecuted
with documents he had been forced to provide under immunity.
</P>
<P>
   --Juries, not judges, must decide whether someone charged with a
hate crime was motivated by bias and therefore can be punished more
severely.
</P>
<P>
STATES' RIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   --State employees cannot sue their state or boss in federal court
over on-the-job discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   --States cannot be sued by private citizens who accuse them of
cheating the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   --Congress can protect motorists' privacy by barring states from
selling information on driver licenses.
</P>
<P>
ELECTIONS AND POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS
</P>
<P>
   --States have sweeping power to impose limits on campaign
contributions to political candidates because such restrictions do
not violate free-speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   --States violate political parties' freedom of association when
they let primary voters choose nominees by voting for any
candidate, regardless of party affiliation. The ruling invalidated
a ''blanket primary'' law and may threaten open primaries in half
the states.
</P>
<P>
   --The federal government cannot reject proposed changes in state
and local election systems even if they are discriminatory so long
as the changes leave minority voters no worse off.
FREE SPEECH
</P>
<P>
   --States have considerable leeway to restrict anti-abortion
demonstrations outside health clinics because the right to avoid
''unwanted communication'' can outweigh free-speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   --A federal law that attempted to shield children from
sex-oriented cable TV channels violated the First Amendment because
it was not the least intrusive means of achieving such a goal.
</P>
<P>
   --State-run schools can subsidize campus groups with money
collected from mandatory student activities fees without violating
the rights of students who find some of those groups objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   --A dancer's freedom of expression can be restricted by requiring
her to wear pasties and a G-string.
</P>
<P>
BUSINESS
</P>
<P>
   --Federal regulation of auto safety bars state court lawsuits
over the lack of air bags in cars built when federal rules did not
require them.
</P>
<P>
   --Workers who say their boss illegally discriminated against them
can win a lawsuit by showing only circumstantial evidence. No
''smoking gun'' is needed.

<HEADLINE> Brit Bombing Suspect Found Guilty  </HEADLINE>
By KRISTIN GAZLAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A white supremacist was found guilty of murder
Friday and sentenced to six life sentences after a spate of
bombings against minorities in London that killed three people and
injured more than 100.
</P>
<P>
   David Copeland, 24, showed no emotion as the jury's verdict was
read, but people in the public gallery -- including victims injured
in the bomb attacks -- clapped and cheered.
</P>
<P>
   ''May you rot in hell,'' Bob Moore, whose son Nik was among
those killed, said as Copeland was led back to his cell.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Michael Hyam sentenced the bomber to six life sentences --
one for each of the three people killed and another for each bomb
planted over a 13-day period in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is only too apparent from what you have said you have no
feelings for those lives you have afflicted,'' the judge said at
the Old Bailey criminal court.
</P>
<P>
   Copeland had admitted planting the bombs, but argued that
because of mental illness he should only be found guilty of
manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The first nail bomb exploded in Brixton, a south London
neighborhood with a large black population, on April 17, 1999. The
second detonated a week later in east London's Brick Lane, a center
of the Bangladeshi community.
</P>
<P>
   The third tore through a popular gay bar in central London's
Soho entertainment district on April 30, 1999. A pregnant
27-year-old woman and two male friends were killed and 70 people
were injured when the bomb -- packed with 1,500 nails -- exploded in
the crowded Admiral Duncan pub.
</P>
<P>
   During the four-week trial, psychiatrists for the defense had
testified that Copeland, an engineer from the commuter town of
Farnborough, suffered from paranoid schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Nigel Sweeney told jurors that Copeland was a
homophobic, Nazi sympathizer who dreamed of starting a ''race
war.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He told (police) that he was a National Socialist or Nazi, who
believed in a white master race,'' Sweeney said. ''He did not like
either black people or Asian people and wanted them out of this
country. He thought British people had the right to ethnic
cleansing like the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney added that Copeland ''thought his bombs would be the
spark to set fire to this country and would set off a racial war
and get whites to vote for the (neo-Nazi) British National Party.''
</P>
<P>
   The bomber's father, Stephen Copeland, said the family would
explore grounds for an appeal, and criticized the victims'
supporters for cheering in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''There wasn't any need for all that clapping and jeering. But I
can understand their glee at the verdict,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Sheds 18; Nasdaq Adds 46  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Friday, with worries over
corporate earnings and rising interest rates hurting blue-chip
shares while a surge in semiconductor stocks lifted the technology
sector.
</P>
<P>
   In late afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 18.04 at 10,380.00, adding to
Thursday's 129-point drop.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 3.14 at 1,445.53 and the Nasdaq composite index was up
46.22 at 3,923.45.
</P>
<P>
   Investors received mixed news on Friday concerning the strength
of the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Commerce Department reported that Americans' incomes
in May rose twice as fast as their spending, pushing the nation's
personal savings rate up to its highest level since the start of
the year. This suggests consumers may be backing away from their
buying binge of the last year.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign that economic growth continues unabated, the
Purchasing Management Association of Chicago said its index of
business activity in the Midwest rose more than expected.The report
is considered a precursor of a national purchasing study due on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Investors continue to look for signs that the economy will cool
off to a more sustainable growth rate to put a lid on inflation and
keep the Federal Reserve from boosting interest rates at its August
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised short-term rates six times in the past year
in an effort to keep inflation under control. On Wednesday, while
noting inflation risks continue in the economy, the Fed left
interest rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Investors worry that additional interest rate hikes will slow
the economy and hurt corporate profits. In the last few days,
dozens of companies have warned of disappointing profits.
</P>
<P>
   The latest was insurer American Financial Group, whose stock
fell $1.25 to $25.688 after announcing that its second-quarter
earnings would fall below expectations. Also anticipating
lower-than-expected earnings was Hooper Holmes, which conducts
physicals for life insurers. Its stock fell $1.375 to $8.75.
</P>
<P>
   ''Inflation remains the key to this market, but corporate
earnings right now are the center stage,'' said Alan Ackerman,
senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. ''We will start seeing a
lot of earnings in the next few weeks. The disappointments will be
a disaster and good earnings will help stocks hold or move to
higher levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer chip stocks moved higher after the Semiconductor
Industry Association said worldwide chip sales reached an all-time
high of $15.8 billion in May, up 39.8 percent from $11.3 billion a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   That helped pushed Rambus up $3.75 to $106.50.
</P>
<P>
   JDS Uniphase rose $1.125 to $117.50 after being added to
PaineWebber's ''Highlighted Stocks'' list.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 7979.12 million
shares, down from 838.49 million shares on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was expected to be choppy Friday, the final day of the
second quarter and the day before a long weekend for many investors
who plan to skip Monday's abbreviated trading session. U.S.
financial markets will close three hours early Monday and be closed
Tuesday in observance of Independence Day.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 0.72 at 511.86.

<HEADLINE> Castro Enjoying Recent Victories  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- His eyes wide and a smile dancing behind his
grizzled beard, Fidel Castro looked like a friendly grandfather,
moving his head back and forth as dozens of youngsters sang a song
about childhood happiness dedicated to Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   The private reunion between Castro and a select group of
children after a march last month of up to 200,000 boys and girls
showed a man who had won important victories during the seven-month
campaign to bring Elian home to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by the kind of young people he hopes will carry on
his revolutionary ideals, Cuba's usually stiff maximum leader even
moved his lips in the videotape shown on state television, singing
along as a young boy clasped his hand and a little girl with a
booming voice warbled into a microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are thousands like you,'' the 73-year-old leader told
the children, ''Dozens of thousands. Hundreds of thousands.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro was not physically present for Elian's return Wednesday,
and it's unknown if he has visited with the boy and his family
since then. The Cuban leader has worked to ensure that neither he
nor the Cuban people appear vainglorious over the boy's
repatriation.
</P>
<P>
   But even before Elian's return, the man described here these
days as ''our unconquerable commander in chief'' had already made
significant political gains.
</P>
<P>
   For perhaps the first time during his 41 years in power, most
Americans found themselves in agreement with Castro on an issue.
They agreed that the 6-year-old boy belonged with his father, even
if it meant they would live in communist Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Since shortly after Elian was rescued off Florida's coast in
late November, polls consistently showed Americans siding with
Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans also approved of the U.S. government's armed raid
that forcibly removed Elian from his Miami relatives' home April 22
and reunited him with his dad, according to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the legal battle over Elian put Cuba on the
front page of U.S. newspapers and at the top of evening broadcasts,
creating new interest in an island that for decades was a mystery
to many Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Cuban-Americans, who have strong opinions stemming from
often dramatic personal experience, the case showed that 10 years
after the collapse of the former Soviet Union most Americans no
longer view Cuba in strictly ideological terms.
</P>
<P>
   And as they learned more about Cuba, Americans increasingly
questioned the nearly four-decade U.S. embargo against the
Caribbean island.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. lawmakers in early June moved toward at least a partial
lifting of the trade sanctions. House Republicans, in an
unprecedented move, this week agreed to lift U.S. restrictions on
sales of food and medicine to Cuba provided they are not financed
by either the federal government or private U.S. sources.
</P>
<P>
   And while American public opinion in the case weighed in
Castro's favor, the exiles he refers to as the Miami ''mafia'' --
who staged noisy protests insisting that Elian stay in the United
States -- were marginalized.
</P>
<P>
   At home, Castro used the battle to whip up patriotic fervor
among the population at large while sparking new political interest
and leadership among Cuba's children and young adults.
</P>
<P>
   While some Cubans admitted privately they had wearied of the
almost daily protests and television shows dedicated to Elian,
virtually all say that the child belonged at home with his father.
</P>
<P>
   The battle especially affected young people, who identified with
the story of the little boy who lost his mother at sea and was
separated from his father.
</P>
<P>
   Very young children were delighted with the packages distributed
at schools that contained heartwarming photographs of Elian and his
father after their reunion in the United States. They came in a box
imprinted with Castro's signature.
</P>
<P>
   When he launched the national campaign of mass mobilizations
back in early December, Castro promised that the nation's young
people would be the protagonists.
</P>
<P>
   After a virulent speech about ''anti-imperialism'' at an April
rally, Lazaro Castro, a bespectacled fourth grader, ran from the
stage to embrace the Cuban president.
</P>
<P>
   The little boy so impressed officials that he was invited to
speak again at the children's march and to attend the private
reunion with Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are the seeds of the great revolution!'' little Lazaro
cried during the private meeting with Castro. ''Commander in chief!
At your orders!''

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House lawmakers who voted against letting
doctors collectively bargain with HMOs got twice as much in
campaign donations from the industry as those who sided with
physicians, an Associated Press analysis shows.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, those who voted in favor of the doctors got about 25
percent more in donations from physicians than their opposing
colleagues, the analysis found.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation allowing the collective bargaining passed early
Friday, 276-136.
</P>
<P>
   The case illustrates how lawmakers' votes often coincide with
the interests of those who pay for their campaigns, said Larry
Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics,
a nonpartisan research group that keeps an eye on money and
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the other side of money and politics,'' Makinson said.
''People don't give money without getting results.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would amend antitrust law to give health care
professionals the same rights enjoyed by union workers to negotiate
with health insurance plans over fees, treatments and other
contract items. Doctors would not be allowed to strike and the bill
would terminate after three years so its economic effects could be
analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over the doctors' legislation is part of a broader
election-year push to give patients more rights in dealing with
cost-conscious HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said the bill would give doctors more leverage to
battle cost-cutting by managed care operators while opponents
contended it could lead to rising health care costs and decisions
by HMOs to drop coverage for some Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation still faces formidable obstacles in the
GOP-controlled Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have donated heavily to lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Overall since Jan. 1, 1999, doctors contributed $4 million to
House members, while HMOs doled out $301,369.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's chief sponsor, Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., had
accused his GOP colleagues of delaying a vote so they could
continue collecting money from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ''They said, 'Don't force me to choose between two potential
contributors.... Just delay it so we can milk both cows,'''
Campbell said in May.
</P>
<P>
   The 136 lawmakers who voted against the bill averaged $1,084 in
contributions from HMOs and company officials, according to an AP
analysis of campaign data from the Center for Responsive Politics.
The 276 House members who supported the bill averaged $496 in HMO
contributions, the analysis found.
</P>
<P>
   Of the five biggest recipients of HMO donations, only one, Rep.
Jim Gibbons, R-Nev., voted for the legislation. He received
$12,349.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., who voted against the legislation,
had the most in HMO contributions at $19,000. She sits on the
health panel of the House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, supporters of the bill to allow collective
bargaining averaged $9,915 in contributions from doctors, compared
with an average of $7,893 for opponents, the analysis showed.
</P>
<P>
   The five lawmakers who raised the most money from doctors voted
for the bill, led by Rep. Greg Ganske, R-Iowa, a
surgeon-turned-congressman who received $73,550 from fellow
physicians.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the American Medical Association's board of trustees
suggested the HMOs should have spent their donations on something
other than an effort to block the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The money they have spent, I imagine we might not have needed
a Campbell bill if they spent it on patient care,'' said Dr. Donald
Palmisano, a New Orleans surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Merritt, a vice president for the American Association of
Health Plans, said the HMO trade group was simply fighting back
against better-financed opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the face of this kind of money politics, you have to do
something to defend yourselves and the interests of consumers,''
Merritt said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reality of this is money won, consumers lost, health care
lost, and policy was made on the altar of special-interest politics
to benefit a small elite group,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Palmisano said the AMA encourages doctors to donate to
congressional candidates, saying, ''We tell them to get involved in
campaigns and to help support people who have good ideas.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton addresses health care graduates at SUNY-Stony Brook  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   STONY BROOK, N.Y. (AP) - Donning her figurative first-lady hat
and a graduation gown, Hillary Rodham Clinton told SUNY-Stony Brook
graduates Friday they are among the first health care professionals
who will be able to beat diseases like cancer, Parkinson's or
Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   ''You'll actually be professionals at a time when it is not
futile or unrealistic to hope that children at the end of this
century will have to look in history books to learn about diseases
that plague us and kill today,'' Clinton told graduates of the
School of Health, Technology and Management.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate against
Republican Rick Lazio, spoke to the health care graduates in her
role as first lady, although she touched on many of the same issues
mentioned during her stump speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Politics aside, ''This day is really about the students,'' noted
Pete Gillen of Shirley, who graduated with a degree in occupational
therapy. But ''I'm grateful that she could share it with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said: ''The future of our health care system will be
determined in large measure by the decisions that we make over the
next few years.'' She said scientific and technological advances,
such has the mapping of the human genetic code, also create ethical
dilemmas for many in the health care field.
</P>
<P>
   ''What good would the best genetic tests in the world be if
people are too worried to use them?'' she asked. ''I think it is
long past time, and it is certainly urgent, that we now outlaw
genetic discrimination, so that our genes and the information
derived from them are used to heal us, not deny us jobs or health
insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said ''it is time that our medical records have just as
much protection as the records of our video store rentals do right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, who headed the Clinton administration's failed
efforts to overhaul the health care system, also said the
scientific advances should be accompanied by ways to ''finance our
health care system in a way that is fair and provides the support
that everyone should have.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called for a ''patients bill of rights that puts
people back in charge of their health care,'' and urged that
prescription drugs be made affordable for all patients.
</P>
<P>
   Later Friday, Clinton echoed the theme in a Manhattan speech to
the American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin.
</P>
<P>
   ''One reason why I support the Democratic version of the
patients bill of rights is because I want doctors making decisions
about my health care, and not some bureacrat in an office a
thousand miles away,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Low Turnout in Iran Run-Off Votes  </HEADLINE>
By ALI AKBAR DAREINI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Turnout appeared low in Tehran's legislative
runoff elections, held Friday to fill two seats for which
first-round reformist victories were annulled by the hard-line
election council.
</P>
<P>
   The two vacant seats in greater Tehran were being contested by
four pro-reform candidates who narrowly missed victory in the
February polls. Turnout was light because of the absence of
conservative candidates in the mix. Results were expected to be
announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm here to show my continuing support for reforms, although
these elections are not significant because only reformists are
vying for the seats,'' Ali Rezai, 38, said after casting his vote.
''I believe if we don't turn out, then the conservatives will
become bolder in their anti-reform attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   President Mohammad Khatami, whose reforms have been opposed by
hard-liners, urged residents to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''Parliamentary elections are very important in a country run by
the people and in view of the balancing role played by the Majlis
(parliament) and its supervision over power,'' Khatami said after
voting early Friday in northern Tehran, according to the official
Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Reformists won about three-quarters of parliament's 290 seats in
the Feb. 18 polls, putting them in control of the legislature for
the first time since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   In the capital, reformists initially were said to have won 29 of
the 30 seats, but the supervisory Guardian Council delayed
endorsing the results for three months, alleging fraud. The council
finally confirmed the Tehran results, but said reformists had won
26 seats.
</P>
<P>
   The council awarded two seats to hard-liners, including one to
former president Hashemi Rafsanjani, and annulled the results in
two other seats.
</P>
<P>
   Among the four candidates competing Friday was Ali Akbar
Mohtashami-Pour, publisher of the reformist newspaper Bayan that
was recently closed by the hard-line judiciary. In the struggle
between conservatives and moderates, hard-liners have shut down 19
pro-reform newspapers and jailed several reformist editors and
political activists in the past three months.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was among those
who voted early Friday in central Tehran.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Poverty Summit Draws to a Close  </HEADLINE>
By NAOMI KOPPEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- A United Nations summit on poverty reduction was
drawing to a close Friday with delegates stressing the importance
of debt relief, market access and more aid, but with few concrete
commitments from rich or poor nations.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations continued into the evening on a declaration of
intent aimed at making sure the money and the political will is in
place to meet the summit's declared target of halving the number of
people living in extreme poverty by 2015. The final agreement was
not expected until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The summit opened with high hopes, five years after the original
poverty summit in Copenhagen drew up a set of commitments which
have been largely ignored. The new declaration says its aim is to
''give new momentum to our collective efforts to improve the human
condition.''
</P>
<P>
   But pressure groups and grass-roots organizations said they
could see little to give them confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Rich countries ''haven't put their money where their mouth is,''
said Julian Disney of the International Council for Social Welfare.
</P>
<P>
   In one of its few references to money, the document says it will
cost $8 billion a year to achieve universal primary education.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve this goal, the report says, ''It is ... essential
that new, concrete financial commitments be made by national
governments and also by bilateral and multilateral donors,'' but it
does not commit nations to anything specific and the agreement is
not binding.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure groups said they were particularly disappointed that no
mention was made of the so-called ''Tobin Tax'' -- a plan to raise
money for development by taxing currency transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were disappointed that the language wasn't much stronger,
that there wasn't a much more solid case made for a study -- even
implementation -- of some kind of currency transaction taxes ... It
is a very small step indeed,'' said David Pfrimmer of the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The issues that divided the rich and poor at the meeting were
the same ones which have hindered trade negotiations and other
major conferences in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   While developing countries complained that their products do not
have fair access to world markets and that creditors are not moving
quickly enough to write off crippling debt, rich countries said the
developing nations must begin to help themselves -- by eliminating
corruption, putting comprehensive poverty reduction plans into
place and ensuring basic human rights.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, countries struggled with the role of private
companies and employers in poverty reduction and the need for rich
countries to make larger donations.
</P>
<P>
   The Copenhagen agreement called for developed countries to
donate at least 0.7 percent of their gross national product in
official development assistance, but only four nations -- Denmark,
Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands -- meet that target.
</P>
<P>
   Among other major nations, France provides 0.4 percent, Japan
0.28 percent and the United States 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The new declaration does make some proposals for poverty
reduction, stressing the need to provide technological assistance
to poor countries. It also calls for creditors to consider debt
standstills when countries are faced with a sudden financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Disney said there was a long way to go, but he was pleased that
the meeting had taken place.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is part of a a very long fight against the forces of
greed and inhumanity and hypocrisy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''One can't expect when one's up against powerful forces of that
kind a dramatic or rapid victory, but it's a modest and useful
step.''

<HEADLINE> Egyptologists Doubt Desert Discovery  </HEADLINE>
By MAHMOUD KASSEM
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Cave drawings an Iowa pilot stumbled on in
the Egyptian desert and experts initially said could date back to
7000 B.C. are now considered suspect, with one leading Egyptologist
dismissing them as fakes no more than 20 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian archaeological authorities announced the find in June,
saying it seemed to span three eras and included writing that could
represent a transition between languages during the early Pharaonic
dynastic period from 3000-2500 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Now experts have begun to cast doubt on the drawings, discovered
by George Cunningham of Algona, Iowa, while he was hunting for
fossils in the desert outside Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are suspicious aspects about the drawings that don't fit
into what we know about that period of Egyptian history,'' Mohammed
el-Saghir, head of the Pharaonic and Greco-Roman sector of the
Supreme Council of Antiquities, said in an interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   El-Saghir, who earlier said he was certain the drawings were of
value after seeing photographs of them, said scientific tests were
being conducted to verify their age. Thousands of pre-dynastic rock
drawings have been found in the deserts of southern Egypt, but
never in northern Egypt, el-Saghir said.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Weeks, a prominent Egyptologist, said one look at
photographs of the find was enough for him to dismiss them as poor
imitations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am 100 percent certain that these drawings are fake,'' he
said. ''It looks as if someone has seen some photographs in a book
on ancient art and slightly misremembered them when they came to
paint them.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I've seen other fake pre-dynastic offerings, but this is the
most audacious and least convincing,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham said he would be disappointed if the drawings turned
out to be fake.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I first saw it, there was a doubt in my mind -- that it
was too good to be true,'' said Cunningham, who trains helicopter
pilots in Egypt for an oil company. ''When the group of Egyptian
archaeologists came to see it, my impression was that it was
genuine.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally, antiquities officials had speculated some of the
drawings could date to 7000 B.C., during the Mesolithic period of
semi-nomadic fishermen and hunters. Others, they said, could be
from Egypt's pre-dynastic history (3400-3100 B.C.), a time of
conflict when the country was divided into north and south. Egypt
then was inhabited by hunter-gatherers and farmers who also
produced pottery and carvings.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks said the drawings, which depicted hunting, mortuary and
religious scenes, would have been cut into the rock, not painted,
if they were genuine.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no painted rock drawings from that (pre-dynastic)
period because they would have eroded, particularly if they were in
limestone, in as little as 75 years,'' said Weeks, a professor at
the American University in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks said the exaggerated breasts and buttocks on the female
figures, livestock without horns and painted temples holding
royalty or deities were uncharacteristic of pre-dynastic Egyptian
art.
</P>
<P>
   One marking, he said, looks like a North American teepee.
</P>
<P>
   In one scene, two mummies flank columns of geometrical designs.
Some experts had speculated those markings could represent a
transition between languages, either before or after hieroglyphics.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks claimed they were a nonsensical ''hotchpotch'' of designs.
</P>
<P>
   ''They look like a combination of geometric designs that would
look more at home in North America,'' he said. ''The mummy figures
are not Egyptian. Ancient Egyptians used a much more formal and
rigorous pose.''

<HEADLINE> DC Mayor Defends Government Reform  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER ANDES
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House lawmakers urged Mayor Anthony A.
Williams on Friday to push harder to reform a District of Columbia
government damaged by previous administrations and to do a better
job balancing city finances.
</P>
<P>
   ''Boldness is what we need,'' said Rep. Ernest Istook, Jr.,
R-Okla., chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee on the
District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Istook questioned why Williams has not replaced agency leaders
who are resisting reform efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can change those people,'' Istook said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he initiated a six-month review in June intended
to hold agency leaders accountable and that he wants to give people
a fair basis for evaluation. As the District's chief financial
officer, Williams fired 165 city workers for incompetence and found
himself embroiled in controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been criticized in the past,'' said Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Many people who do not meet performance goals may accept an
early retirement plan intended in part as a cost-savings measure,
Williams said. The goal is to reduce the government work force by
1,000 full-time employees this year at a savings of $37 million, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to make sure those savings happen,'' Istook said.
</P>
<P>
   Istook and Rep. James P. Moran, D-Va., questioned the city's
ability to monitor savings and reform efforts in light of a General
Accounting Office report issued Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The report focused on $330 million spent on 280 management
reform programs intended to save $200 million and improve the
quality of service to residents over the past three years. It found
that just 69 of the 280 projects were completed or showed results
and that the District has reported savings of just $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a pretty sad effort at management reform,'' Moran said.

<HEADLINE> Gas station attendant murdered and robbed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERNARDS TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - An attendant at an isolated gas
station off Interstate 78 was robbed and shot to death as he was
giving directions to a woman and her daughter, Somerset County
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Other customers were at the King George Exxon at 9:20 p.m.
Thursday when Joseph Sass, 31, of Phillipsburg, Warren County, was
shot once in the face, authorities said. He was pronounced dead at
Morristown Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman remains at large.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, described as a black man in his mid-20s, had
approached Sass moments earlier, asking if the vending machines
took dollar bills, Somerset County Prosecutor Wayne J. Forrest
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sass said they did, and the man went to the machines.
</P>
<P>
   The man then returned to Sass, who was giving the motorist
directions, and asked for change of a $5 bill, Forrest said.
</P>
<P>
   Sass took cash from a pocket and began counting five $1 bills
when the man pointed a handgun in his face and demanded all the
money, Forrest said.
</P>
<P>
   Sass complied and was shot once, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman lowered the gun and walked to the nearby access road
for the Warren Township sewage plant. Soon after, a van left the
access road and headed west on Interstate 78, Forrest said.

<HEADLINE> State Dept. Urges Dialogue in China  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department again urged peaceful
dialogue between China and Taiwan on Friday but avoided any
commentary on the latest statements over the possibility of
establishing a single China.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's up to Beijing and Taipei to determine when they have the
basis for the dialogue,'' said spokesman Richard Boucher. He urged
both sides to show more flexibility in their disagreement on
Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan, which broke away from the mainland
in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian on Tuesday said he could
accept a 1992 deal with China that Taiwanese believe would allow
both sides to interpret ''one China'' in its own way. But China on
Friday accused Chen of betraying hopes for improved relations by
refusing to flatly acknowledge that Taiwan is part of Chinese
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher reiterated U.S. support for one China under the
government in Beijing and said the United States remains
''committed to promoting peace, stability and prosperity'' in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our abiding interest is in a peaceful resolution of the
differences between the two sides, and we will certainly continue
to advocate that and to welcome any steps that would foster
dialogue, but also urge the parties to refrain from any actions
that would increase tensions in the region,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An editorial distributed by China's official Xinhua News Agency
accused Chen of distorting the 1992 agreement by claiming that the
sides had agreed to interpret ''one China'' differently. Beijing
says both sides in agreed to adhere to the ''one-China principle''
but there was no actual discussion of what ''one China'' means.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has been suspicious of Chen because his party advocates
Taiwan's formal and permanent independence from China, not eventual
unification.
</P>
<P>
   The sides have been at odds since the communist takeover of the
mainland 51 years ago, and China still threatens to use force to
unify itself with Taiwan if necessary.

the kind of fame he enjoys today. Now he's not so sure he wants it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's almost turning into more of a nightmare than a dream,''
he told the Detroit Free Press.
</P>
<P>
   Eminem, the 27-year-old artist who was born as Marshall Mathers
III, faces gun charges in Royal Oak and Warren. He also faces a
civil suit by a man who says Eminem attacked him while carrying a
gun.
</P>
<P>
   ''I miss going to the park and playing basketball,'' he said.
''I was never that person who wanted the big cars and (Mercedes)
Benzes. All I really wanted was to have a career in hip-hop.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, Eminem won Grammys for his debut album, ''The Slim
Shady LP,'' and its hit single ''My Name Is.'' His new album, ''The
Marshall Mathers LP,'' has gone platinum, with sales of 4 million
in its first five weeks.

<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - John Denofa, the Buckingham, Pa.,
businessman charged with killing an exotic dancer, posted a
$500,000 bond Friday and was released, according to the Burlington
County prosecutor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Denofa, 35, had been in jail on a $1 million bond after he was
charged with the death of 21-year-old Rachel Siani. Her body was
found April 1 under a bridge that connects the New Jersey and
Pennsylvania turnpikes.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Superior Court Judge John A. Sweeney in Mount Holly
agreed to reduce Denofa's bond during a recent hearing, at which
more than 20 of Denofa's friends and relatives appeared on his
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to his release Friday, Denofa had to sign an affidavit not
to fight extradition and a form promising he would not apply for a
passport, said First Assistant Burlington County Prosecutor Raymond
Milavsky.
</P>
<P>
   Siani worked at Divas International Gentleman's Club in Bristol
Township, Pa. The Bensalem, Pa., resident was last seen with Denofa
March 29 in the club's parking lot, according to police.

<HEADLINE> Russia Claims Victory Over Rebels  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- A top Russian general on Friday said
troops had annihilated a band of Chechen rebels after a five-day
firefight in the southern mountains, while another shootout
reportedly erupted in Chechnya's capital, Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Gen. Gennady Troshev said the fighting near the southern
town of Serzhen-Yurt was over, and that the rebel band had been
''annihilated.''
</P>
<P>
   The fighting underscored that Chechnya remains restive, despite
repeated Russian claims that the nine-month war is over.
</P>
<P>
   As that battle wound down, clashes erupted Friday in a forest
just south of Grozny after soldiers discovered rebels preparing an
ambush, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Boxed in by forests on both sides of a highway, the ambushed
troops opened fire at the trees with grenade launchers and
heavy-caliber machine guns, but were unsure if they hit any rebels,
the report said, citing an Interfax correspondent at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, about 21 miles to the south, Russian soldiers began
searching through dense greenery near Serzhen-Yurt, where fighting
raged this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''A mopping-up operation is under way in the area, and the
situation is on the whole under control,'' Troshev said, according
to ITAR-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Russian television showed dead bodies on the forest floor, which
had been pounded for three days by Russian artillery, machine guns,
grenades and aerial bombs and rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential spokesman on Chechnya Sergei Yastrzhembsky said
Friday that troops had found fresh graves, and ''on the ground
fragments of the bodies of over 40 fighters were strewn.''
</P>
<P>
   Troshev said more than 100 rebels had been killed, but the claim
could not be confirmed. Russian officials often overstate enemy
losses.
</P>
<P>
   One Russian serviceman was killed Friday and six were wounded in
the area when their army truck was ambushed. After a mine
explosion, rebels opened fire, according to one soldier who was
interviewed by NTV television.
</P>
<P>
   At least 12 Russian soldiers were killed at Serzhen-Yurt earlier
this week. Serzhen-Yurt lies at the head of the Vedeno Gorge, a key
rebel refuge in the southern mountains.
</P>
<P>
   On a visit to Chechnya on Friday, Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev said the rebel group near Serzhen-Yurt had planned to
attack Gudermes, Chechnya's second-largest city and used as the
administrative seat for a pro-Moscow government.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic leader Akhmad Kadyrov, the Chechen head of the
pro-Moscow administration, said Friday he hoped to meet with
President Vladimir Putin next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a very serious issue that can only be settled at the
level of the Russian president, and Vladimir Putin should make a
decision on it personally,'' Kadyrov told journalists in Grozny,
according to Interfax. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Continued fighting has deterred most refugees from returning,
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Friday in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   About 170,000 refugees remain in the neighboring republic of
Ingushetia, and many are likely to remain through next winter,
UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops were driven out of Chechnya in a 1994-96 war with
independence fighters. They went back in September, after
Chechnya-based Islamic militants raided several villages in the
neighboring Russian region of Dagestan, and after about 300 people
died in apartment bombings the government blamed on Chechens.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Driver Cell Phones Banned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- Hong Kong drivers will no longer be allowed to
use hand-held cellular phones while on the road after a new law
goes into effect this weekend, a transport official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Saturday, drivers face a $256 fine if caught holding a
cell phone while driving, Transport Bureau spokeswoman Joyce Yip
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, they can still use so-called ''handsfree devices,''
such as headphones and speaker phones, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mobile phones are very popular here, but drivers get
distracted when they're talking on the phone. It affects their
driving performance,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Data from other countries show that cell phone use contributes
to a higher accident rate, but Hong Kong hasn't kept such
statistics, Yip said.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phones are ubiquitous in this Asian financial hub. About 65
percent of the population -- 4.47 million people -- use cell phones.

<HEADLINE> Tax breaks on gas, clothing go on books Saturday  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Connecticut drivers are promised a break
at the gas pump and shoppers will pick up a few bargains when new
tax cuts go on the books Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The state's gasoline tax - the highest in the country next to
Hawaii - will be rolled back 7 cents to a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Gas station owners will be required to pass the savings on to
customers. And the state's consumer protection chief says he'll be
keeping a watchful eye.
</P>
<P>
   ''State inspectors will be out making sure the prices reflect
the tax cut,'' Consumer Protection Commissioner James Fleming said.
</P>
<P>
   If drivers suspect they're being fleeced at the filling station,
they can call make a toll-free phone call to the consumer
protection hotline at 1-800-842-2649.
</P>
<P>
   It may take a few days for some stations to comply with the
lower prices - they're allowed to sell off any gasoline they
already have in their tanks at the 32-cent tax rate. But once they
get new shipments, the prices must come down. If they don't decline
within the next 120 days, station owners can be slapped with a $500
fine and a 6-month prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Legislature has put some teeth in this cut,'' Fleming
said.
</P>
<P>
   During the 4-month inspection period, gas station owners will be
required to account for price increases.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Fox, executive director of the Gasoline &AMP; Automotive
Service Dealers of America, said he doesn't expect pump prices to
skyrocket after the 120 day inspection period - unless wholesalers
drive up the cost.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the prices go up, it won't be happening from our end,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John G. Rowland, who pushed for the 7-cent reduction during
this year's legislative session despite initial resistance from
Democratic leaders, says the tax break will save $85 to $140 a year
for a family that drives 30,000 miles. Making Connecticut's gas
prices competitive with border states will also keep drivers from
spending their money across state lines.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping will also be a little easier on residents' wallets. The
sales tax on clothing and footwear is being lifted on items priced
up to $75 - that's an increase from the $50 tax exemption.
</P>
<P>
   And clothing that costs less than $300 will be tax-free during
the third week of August, an incentive aimed at back-to-school
shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Child car seats, college textbooks, and items bought from
vending machines that cost less than 50 cents also will no longer
be taxed.
</P>
<P>
   And automobiles with a federal Environmental Protection Agency
rating of 50 miles per gallon will be driving off the lots tax
free. Currently, the only vehicles with such fuel efficiency are
cars that are powered with a combination of gasoline and
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ''That tax exemption gives people an incentive to try the new
technology,'' said Ellen Schneider, a spokeswoman from the
Department of Revenue Services. ''It could save people thousands of
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday also ushers in a tax cut for movie tickets costing more
than $5. The current 10 percent tax is being whittled down 8
percent during the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Saturday, the state will start making more grants
available to school districts trying to put more computer
technology in classrooms, and the tax on computer data processing
services will drop from 3 percent to 2 percent.

<P>
	   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) - James Benedetto rode Kondor to victory
in the $7,500 Turtle Lane Farm Jump-off Friday at the 31st annual
Lake Placid Horse Show.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of 31 starters qualified for a tiebreaking jump-off by
riding without penalty over the original 14-jump course at the
North Elba Show Grounds. Benedetto, of Northport, rode Kondor to a
second fault-free run through the course in 31.987 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Kraut of Oconomowoc, Wis., winner of last Sunday's
$100,000 Rolex U.S. Show Jumping Championship at the U.S.
Equestrian Team Olympic Training Center in Gladstone, N. J., was
fourth to try the jump-off course and she beat Benedetto's time,
finishing in 31.813 seconds. Kraut's horse, Anthem, hit a rail on
the second-to-last fence for a penalty of four faults and a
fifth-place finish. Kraut is the top ranked rider for the U.S.
Equestrian Team's Olympic show jumping squad.
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to Jimmy Torano of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., who
had a fault-free ride in 32.616 seconds on Extra. Christopher
Cawley of Keswick, Va., was third with a clean ride in 34.493
seconds on Brave Ally.

<HEADLINE> Dumping Nuke Waste Into Sea Banned  </HEADLINE>
By JAN M. OLSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- A European conference on protecting
the northeastern Atlantic Ocean's maritime environment has banned
nuclear reprocessing plants from discharging waste into the sea,
but the decision won't apply to France and Britain -- the only two
countries in the region to have such plants.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the discharges banned by the OSPAR accord come from
three nuclear reprocessing plants -- Sellafield and Dounreay in
Britain, and La Hague in France.
</P>
<P>
   The ban was largely symbolic, since France and Britain abstained
and so were not legally bound by the vote. But environmental
leaders said they hoped the two countries would get the message.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is an amicable signal (to France and Britain). It is not
a start of hostility,'' said Danish Environment Minister Svend
Auken, who hosted the five-day conference attended by the 16
countries that are part of the OSPAR convention, which protects
waters that stretch from the Arctic Circle in the north to Portugal
on Europe's southwestern tip.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve OSPAR members voted in favor of the accord, providing the
necessary three-quarters approval to make it legally binding. No
time frame was provided for ultimately eliminating the waste
discharges into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Reprocessing nuclear waste involves removing unused uranium or
plutonium from spent fuel rods for reuse at energy plants. Auken
said the practice posed ''a major risk for accidents.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, a British government report said workers at
Sellafield deliberately falsified records relating to the quality
of fuel pellets. The plant was shut down until the problem was
corrected.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know that security work is sloppy,'' Auken said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace, which had observer status at the meeting, welcomed
the accord. ''It's a defeat for nuclear reprocessing industry,''
International Political Director Remi Parmentier said.
</P>
<P>
   OSPAR has already banned dumping of nuclear waste from ships,
platforms and aircraft into waters that stretch from the northern
Arctic Circle to Portugal on Europe's southwestern tip.
</P>
<P>
   Other OSPAR members are Belgium, Finland, Germany, Iceland,
Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and
Switzerland, the European Union and Luxembourg, which was absent
from the vote on Friday.

'Crumple Zone' Exploits Cantone   
An AP Entertainment Review
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Nobody does comic agitation better than Mario
Cantone.
</P>
<P>
   The man can work himself up to considerable grief -- part nasal
whine, part shriek, part diva-like dementia -- that rarely fails to
produce a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, Cantone, a short guy with big talent, has to do
all the work in ''The Crumple Zone,'' an artificial gay comedy now
playing at off-Broadway's Rattlestick Theater. The play by Buddy
Thomas exploits its leading man without offering him much support.
</P>
<P>
   The setting is Staten Island at Christmas, a place and time
guaranteed to bring out the worst in people. Out-of-work actor
Terry, played by Cantone, hates the holiday, hates his job as a
waiter in a Mafia-owned diner, but, most of all, hates the fact
that he is not in a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Terry mopes and moons over Buck, a lanky fellow who seems intent
on busting up the romance between Terry's roommate, Alex, and Matt,
an actor out on the road in a tour of Stephen King's ''Salem's
Lot'' -- the musical.
</P>
<P>
   Terry, of course, is a hopeless romantic, despite a vicious
tongue and a propensity to solve every problem with a bottle of
Absolut. He believes that even if the course of true love never
runs smooth, it should not be allowed to detour.
</P>
<P>
   Cantone, at least, gives his character some depth, a quality the
other actors in the production have not been able to do. But then,
Cantone has the best lines in the play. He has some wonderfully
dizzy physical moments, too.
</P>
<P>
   Watch him try to get out from under a Christmas tree, which has
toppled to the ground during one of the comedy's more emotional
moments. Or lip-synching to a smashing rendition by Debbie Gravitte
of the old Kalmar and Ruby standard, ''Nevertheless I'm in Love
with You.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' comedy teeters between sporadically amusing farce and
unconvincing soap opera. Cantone provides the looniness, the other
actors the suds. Director Jason Moore keeps the convoluted story
moving at a reasonable clip, wisely getting the other actors out of
the way when Cantone takes over.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, ''The Crumple Zone,'' which during the course of
its two short acts verges on the saccharine, pulls away from a
predictable happy ending. And it's Cantone's character who gets to
deliver the common-sense advice.
</P>
<P>
   The play's title, according to program notes, is an automotive
term: ''an area of a car designed to compress during an accident to
absorb the energy from impact.'' The author seems to be saying that
everyone needs a crumple zone to cushion the crashes that threaten
to cause serious emotional or physical injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Cantone has had several notable roles in the past, replacing
Nathan Lane in ''Love! Valour! Compassion!'' and Bill Irwin when
the Patrick Stewart ''Tempest'' moved from Central Park to
Broadway. Now someone needs to showcase his talents in a strong new
play. ''The Crumple Zone'' isn't it.

<HEADLINE> Few Celebrate Congo Independence  </HEADLINE>
By KAMANGA MUTOND
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) -- Few celebrated as Congo marked 40 years
of independence from Belgium on Friday with military bands and a
parade in a country ravaged by years of corruption and civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of soldiers and civilians, some dressed in the colors
of the flag, marched to the beat of military bands down a central
boulevard decorated with pots of flowers, as President Laurent
Kabila and Belgian Prime Minister Louis Michel looked on.
</P>
<P>
   But many in this vast Central African nation avoided the
festivities and went about their ordinary activities, or just
stayed home.
</P>
<P>
   Congolese newspapers were critical of the festivities, with the
opposition Le Potentiel describing the past 40 years as ''a
nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Congo was ruined by decades of government neglect and corruption
under the late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, who became one of the
world's richest men by plundering the vast mineral wealth of the
country, then known as Zaire.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila was welcomed as a liberator when his army swept across
the country in eight months in 1997. But a year later, he faced a
rebellion launched by Congolese Tutsis, disaffected soldiers and
opposition politicians who accused him of mismanagement, corruption
and warmongering.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the misery of Congo's impoverished citizens has only
increased. Hospitals don't have medicine. Schools have shut down.
Roads -- if they exist at all -- are unusable through large parts of
the interior.
</P>
<P>
   A cease-fire agreement was signed July 10 by Kabila and his
allies -- Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia -- and by Rwanda and Uganda,
who are backing the rebels. The main rebel factions signed on in
the weeks that followed.
</P>
<P>
   But fighting has continued, with all sides accusing each other
of violations.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Kabila said he was pleased ''the people have
resisted aggression and managed to celebrate the 40th anniversary
of independence.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But we have to look to the future with greater optimism,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Congo was founded in the late 19th century as the personal
property of Belgium's King Leopold II. The Belgian government took
control in 1908, and the country's colonial rulers withdrew in 1960
following massive pro-independence riots.

14-year-old son of Javid Bent-Yacoub. Defense attorneys have said
Daniel's father, a 42-year-old shop owner, testified to collecting
military information for Israel but insisted his actions weren't
espionage.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 people -- only men and boys to avoid overcrowding --
attended the prayers at Rabeezadeh Synagogue. Because of the Jewish
Sabbath, all the men arrived on foot for the prayers.
</P>
<P>
   ''My mother is at home,'' Daniel said. ''She prefers to pray in
solitude. She's quite anxious, but hopeful for God's mercy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some women relatives of the defendants came after the prayers to
offer one another support. They hugged each other and said they
were praying for the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The case has cast a pall over the 6,000-strong Jewish community
of Shiraz, the ancient capital of the Persian empire that attracted
people of all faiths because of its wealth and tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the 13 Jewish defendants have pleaded guilty, four have
pleaded innocent and one -- Bent-Yacoub -- acknowledged passing
information but maintains his action did not constitute espionage.
Israel has denied any of the 13 were spies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, two Jews were hanged at Tehran's Evin prison on similar
spying charges. Iranian officials have differed on whether the
death penalty could be applied if any of the 13 in the current case
are convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The trial of the imprisoned Jews has attracted attention from
the United States, Israel and several European countries, which
have demanded Iran free the suspects. Representatives of the Dutch
and Canadian embassies were in Shiraz to await the verdict;
Japanese and Australian officials were expected Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's Jewish community, although it has dwindled over the
decades, remains the Middle East's largest outside Israel. Iranian
Jews are allowed to practice aspects of their religion but are
forbidden to teach Hebrew, the liturgical language.
</P>
<P>
   At its height, Iran's Jewish community numbered about 100,000
and was still around 80,000 just before Iran's 1979 Islamic
revolution. Now there are about 25,000 Jews. Among those attending
the prayers Friday were Haroun Yashayaii, head of Iran's Jewish
society and Maurice Moatamed, the single Jewish representative in
the 290-seat Majlis, or parliament.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Sailors' Kin Seek Damages  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Relatives of 323 Argentine
sailors who died when the British sank their ship during the 1982
Falklands Islands war will seek damages from England in an
international court, their lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Two lawyers representing the families of sailors aboard the
warship Belgrano said Thursday they would press their case next
week before the International Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg,
France.
</P>
<P>
   The sinking of the Belgrano marked the turning point in the
10-week war. Battling in the South Atlantic Ocean, the warship
British Conqueror torpedoed the Belgrano.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers, Jorge Appiani and Jorge Antonio Olivera, contend
the sinking violated wartime conventions set by the Hague in 1907
because it occurred beyond the 200-mile limit of the theater of
operations designated by Britain.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate response to those claims.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina contends it inherited the islands, which it calls the
Malvinas and where about 2,200 people of mostly British ancestry
live, from the Spanish crown before they were occupied by Britain
in 1833.
</P>
<P>
   The Falklands war -- won by Britain in 74 days -- claimed at least
970 lives and helped hasten the departure of Argentina's military
government of the era.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina never sought damages against England after the war.
After nearly a decade of icy relations, the two countries restored
diplomatic relations in 1990, although Argentina still maintains
its claim to the islands.

<HEADLINE> McCall approves Medicaid provider contract extension despite doubts </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - State Comptroller H. Carl McCall Friday
approved a two-year contract extension between the state and
Maximus Inc. despite his ''serious concerns'' about the company's
Medicaid managed care enrollment work.
</P>
<P>
   The $43 million contract amendments call for Maximus to continue
handling Medicaid managed care enrollments for the state Health
Department in New York City, and to extend the program to Nassau
and Suffolk counties on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   The state's current contract with Maximus was to expire at
midnight Friday. It was signed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said his review of the contract extension raised
questions in his mind of how accurate the information was which the
company was providing to Medicaid recipients. Those same concerns
were raised in 1999 by Mark Green, New York City's public advocate.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said he was also troubled that as of earlier this month,
information about Medicaid managed care was not available from
Maximus in languages other than English and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 670,000 people currently enrolled in Medicaid
managed care in New York state, about 390,000 in New York City.
State Health Commissioner Dr. Antonia Novello says she wants to
expand enrollments to 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nassau and Suffolk county enrollments are currently handled by
local social services officials.
</P>
<P>
   Maximus is not providing health care coverage or services in New
York, but is finding eligible Medicaid recipients and enrolling
them in managed care.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department is confident Maximus can do the job its
contract calls for and has been pleased with the responsiveness of
the company when problems or concerns have been pointed out,
department spokesman John Signor said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will continue to monitor and oversee Maximus operations as
we always have to ensure a Medicaid recipient receives quality
health care in managed care,'' Signor said.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman added that Health Department officials were
''amazed'' that McCall continues to raise concerns about Maximus
since the department believes it answered them months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are really old issues,'' Signor said. ''They have mostly
been taken care of.''
</P>
<P>
   Maximus, based in McLean, Va., is currently embroiled in a court
battle in New York City over the awarding of more than $100 million
in city welfare-to-work contracts to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Maximus is the nation's largest operator of welfare-to-work
programs for state and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from the company Friday.

<HEADLINE> Sign-Language Used in Egypt Mosques  </HEADLINE>
By BASSEM MROUE
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Mohammed Abdel-Fattah, who is deaf, has
attended Friday prayers every week for decades. This Friday, he was
finally able to follow every word.
</P>
<P>
   Friday prayers at Cairo's Sayyida Zeinab Mosque were translated
into sign language this week -- a first in an Egyptian mosque.
Hundreds of deaf people were among those worshipping at the mosque,
where a sign-language interpreter is to be a regular feature.
</P>
<P>
   ''I used to get angry about attending the prayers and not being
able to understand,'' Abdel-Fattah, 60, said through a translator.
''I am very happy that something like this is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Younes, head of the Egyptian Organization for Rights of
the Disabled, said no one should get in the way of a person wanting
to be closer to God.
</P>
<P>
   ''The deaf and the mute, all over the world, are living in a
prison of isolation,'' he said. ''We are opening the way, and we
hope it will never be closed again.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 7 million disabled among Egypt's 65 million people,
Younes said. Of them, 2 million are deaf.
</P>
<P>
   Younes, who is blind, said the Ministry of Religious Endowments
gave his organization approval to start with sign-language
interpreters in three Cairo mosques and to expand in the future.
Some churches in Egypt also have started to provide sign-language
interpreters at Sunday services, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The important thing is that the deaf and mute -- no matter what
their nationality, social class, wealth, position, color or
religion -- know their way to God,'' Younes said.
</P>
<P>
   As the imam spoke from a pulpit Friday about the good deeds of
Islam's Prophet Mohammed, hundreds of people watched as Alaa-Eddine
el-Sayyed delivered the sheik's remarks in sign language.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't able to sleep the past two nights for being so
excited and happy that I would be the first person to translate the
Friday prayers,'' said el-Sayyed, who works for the Egyptian rights
group. ''The happiness that I saw in the faces of the deaf and mute
made me even happier.''

<HEADLINE> Nasxdaq Ends Up 89; Dow Gains 50  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks ended a difficult first half on an upbeat
note Friday as institutional investors bought the year's big
winners and discarded underperforming issues.
</P>
<P>
   Rallying in the final hour of trading, the Dow Jones industrial
average erased a small loss and finished up 49.85 at 10,447.85,
according to preliminary calculations. For the week, the Dow added
43.14.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, lifted by computer chips and
semiconducter stocks, rose 88.89 to 3,966.12. The Nasdaq added
120.78 for the week.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also were higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 3.32 at 1,445.71.
</P>
<P>
   Investors received mixed news on Friday concerning the strength
of the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Commerce Department reported that Americans' incomes
in May rose twice as fast as their spending, pushing the nation's
personal savings rate up to its highest level since the start of
the year. This suggests consumers may be backing away from their
buying binge of the last year.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign that economic growth continues unabated, the
Purchasing Management Association of Chicago said its index of
business activity in the Midwest rose more than expected.The report
is considered a precursor of the national purchasing managers'
report due on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Investors continue to look for signs that the economy will cool
off to a more sustainable growth rate to put a lid on inflation and
keep the Federal Reserve from boosting interest rates at its August
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised short-term rates six times in the past year
in an effort to keep inflation under control. On Wednesday, while
noting inflation risks continue in the economy, the Fed left
interest rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Investors worry that additional interest rate hikes will slow
the economy and hurt corporate profits. In the last few days,
dozens of companies have warned of disappointing profits.
</P>
<P>
   The latest was insurer American Financial Group, whose stock
fell $1.25 to $25.688 after announcing that its second-quarter
earnings would fall below expectations. Also anticipating
lower-than-expected earnings was Hooper Holmes, which conducts
physicals for life insurers. Its stock fell $2.125 to $8.
</P>
<P>
   ''Inflation remains the key to this market, but corporate
earnings right now are the center stage,'' said Alan Ackerman,
senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. ''We will start seeing a
lot of earnings in the next few weeks. The disappointments will be
a disaster and good earnings will help stocks hold or move to
higher levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer chip stocks moved higher after the Semiconductor
Industry Association said worldwide chip sales reached an all-time
high of $15.8 billion in May, up 39.8 percent from $11.3 billion a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   That helped pushed Rambus up $2.06 to $103.
</P>
<P>
   JDS Uniphase rose $3.50 to $119.875 after being added to
PaineWebber's ''Highlighted Stocks'' list.
</P>
<P>
   With Friday's advance, the Dow finished the first half down 9
percent for the year. The Nasdaq finished the first half down 2.54
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was choppy Friday, the day before a long weekend for
many investors who plan to skip Monday's abbreviated trading
session. U.S. financial markets will close three hours early Monday
and be closed Tuesday in observance of Independence Day.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.4 billion shares,
up from 1.10 billion shares on Thursday. It was the third heaviest
trading volume ever on the NYSE.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 2.07 at 514.65.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.37 percent,
Germany's DAX index was up 0.34 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up
1.18 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.71 percent.

<HEADLINE> Report: Power reliability still at risk this summer  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - Those summer ''power watch'' alerts will
likely be common again this summer, since many of the problems that
caused problems last year have not been remedied, state regulators
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Stresses on the power system will not be alleviated until new
power plants and transmission systems are built in the state, the
Department of Public Utility Control said Thursday in a draft
report.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is still a risk of significant shortfall in supply over
the next few summers,'' the DPUC said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also chronicles the reasons for last summer's power
problems, which got so bad on one day in June that the governors of
Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island shut down state
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ISO-New England, which manages the region's power system, said
it has put new programs and regulations in place to improve
reliability.
</P>
<P>
   Power watches will remain one way of reducing electricity demand
on hot, summer days when utilities have to dip into power reserves,
said ISO-New England spokesman Jim Sinclair. In issuing the alerts,
utilities ask consumers to voluntarily shut off unneeded
appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would like nothing more than to have more generation for
summer than we had,'' Sinclair said. ''What we're projecting is six
to nine days this summer, when we'll have to go into that reserve
tank, and three or four times we'll be looking to the public to
keep that reserve tank full.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That's an improved situation over last year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since last summer, ISO-New England has set up contracts where
companies would be paid to reduce their power use in emergencies.
Also, because of unexpected hot weather in June for the past few
years, power plants are now not supposed to schedule outages that
month.
</P>
<P>
   ISO-New England and the DPUC agree, however, that the power
watches and other measures to conserve in high-demand times are
symptomatic of stresses on the system.
</P>
<P>
   The DPUC will take testimony from ISO-New England, utilities and
other groups before issuing a final report, scheduled for July 26.
</P>
<P>
   State lawmakers plan to review the report this summer to see
what policy changes may be possible to improve electric
reliability, said Rep. Kevin DelGobbo of Naugatuck, the ranking
Republican on the Energy and Technology Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In its 68-page report, the DPUC points out that Connecticut's
power situation has changed from several years ago, when power
scarcity was rare.
</P>
<P>
   Two nuclear power plants, Connecticut Yankee and Millstone Unit
1, are shut down and being decommissioned.
</P>
<P>
   While companies in Wallingford, Killingly, Oxford and Milford
plan to build new power plants, none of the plants is yet running,
and some may never be built because of local conflicts, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   The state's ability to import power remains limited, especially
in Fairfield County. Individual neighborhoods that were woods and
farms a few years ago are taxing the local distribution system.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommends Connecticut Light &AMP; Power Co. speed up its
responses to transformer problems and study whether the
distribution system is big enough to handle growing residential
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Plans to build an 600-megawatt capacity electric line under Long
Island Sound from New Haven to Long Island are in the works, but
the project has just received state approval.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's energy demand has changed along with its shift
from a manufacturing economy to a service economy.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, factories used 37 percent of the state's power,
and commercial use was 29 percent. Today, 40 percent of the power
is for commercial use, which means more air conditioning and longer
evening hours than manufacturing used, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The DPUC wants electric utilities to beef up conservation
measures, particularly for energy-saving air conditioners. The
agency also wants air conditioner installers to notify power
companies when they put in new central air systems.

<HEADLINE> Man convicted of manslaughter in Brooklyn circus slaying  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - It began as a typical night at the Bindlestiff
Family Cirkus - plenty of fire-eating, sword-swallowing and
tightrope-walking.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who dressed up as a clown got in for half price. What the
clowns didn't bargain for was a violent clash between two
circus-goers and old rivals - Drew Feuer and Eli Hormann.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the men separated, the circus was a bloody crime
scene.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a Brooklyn jury found Feuer, 26, guilty of
manslaughter in the stabbing death of Hormann. He faces a maximum
of 12 1/2 to 25 years in prison at sentencing July 13.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, who had sought a murder conviction, refused
comment. But Hormann's half-sister, Kaarin Von Herrlich, called the
outcome of the two-week trial in state Supreme Court ''fair.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense tried to portray Hormann ''as some kind of
monster,'' Von Herrlich said. ''The jury did not believe that. ...
He wasn't a violent person by nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Feuer, meanwhile, ''is devastated by the verdict,'' said his
attorney, Paul Callan.
</P>
<P>
   Callan's client had claimed self-defense in a case that shocked
members of the underground scene in Brooklyn's Williamsburg
section, where the Bindlestiff Family Cirkus - a traveling band of
offbeat sideshow performers - is based.
</P>
<P>
   The bad blood between Hormann, 24, a bicycle messenger from
Boston, and Feuer dated to 1995. That's when Feuer and his
girlfriend, Paige Stevenson, evicted Hormann and his girlfriend
from Stevenson's warehouse loft.
</P>
<P>
   On March 28, 1998, both couples attended a fund-raiser at the
Brooklyn Brewery featuring the circus. Feuer testified that he
arrived to find Stevenson, dressed as a clown, being berated by
Hormann.
</P>
<P>
   Feuer - a dreadlocked, slightly built tugboat worker with
tattoos and piercings covering much of his body - told the jury
that when he intervened, the much bigger Hormann attacked, knocking
him down with a flurry of blows and trying to smash his head on the
ground. The defendant said he responded by pulling out a
Leatherman, a knifelike seaman's tool.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought he wanted to kill me,'' Feuer testified. ''I reached
and got out my Leatherman, and I used it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hormann was stabbed three times in the chest and stomach. He
lapsed into a coma within minutes.
</P>
<P>
   One grand jury refused to charge Feuer with attempted murder.
But when Hormann died on June 11, 1998, a second grand jury voted
to indict him for murder.
</P>
<P>
   Feuer's attorney said he would argue on appeal that the district
attorney acted improperly by presenting the case to a grand jury
twice.

<HEADLINE> Murder rate up slightly; perception even bigger problem  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The year 2000 began on an ominous note: The
city's murder rate rose 12 percent in the first three months.
</P>
<P>
   Police brass started wondering whether the plunging homicide
rates of the 1990s were a trend of the past. Then, on paper at
least, things began to improve. For the first half of this year,
murders rose only 2.4 percent, and other violent crimes decreased,
according to statistics released this week.
</P>
<P>
   Perception is a different matter. The still-fresh recollection
of the Central Park attacks has residents and tourists alike
questioning how safe they really are.
</P>
<P>
   ''I used to run in the park almost everyday, but I've been going
to the gym more since those attacks,'' said Jenna McLaughlin, 31,
of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 teen-age girls and women were drenched with water,
molested, stripped or robbed by a roving mob in the park on June
11, the day of the city's Puerto Rican Day Parade.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got lulled into this real sense of security, then the
attacks occurred and made me rethink how safe the city is,''
McLaughlin said. ''I still think it's safe, but I think there's
more crime these days than before.''
</P>
<P>
   Some tourists, like Masanobu and Yuko Kawabata of Tokyo, are
sticking to Central Park West, admiring the stately apartment
buildings but not venturing into the park.
</P>
<P>
   ''We read about the attacks in the park before we came here, and
decided not to go in,'' Masanobu Kawabata said. ''That was very
scary for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Crime experts recommend caution, but not panic.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although murders have been down, 1950 is the 20th century's
low point for murders, and we're still nowhere near that,'' noted
Eric Monkkonen, a University of California at Los Angeles professor
who studies urban murders and is writing a history book called
''Murder in New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   There were 294 murders among New York's 7.9 million people in
1950, compared to the city's all-time high of 2,290 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The past two years, however, have seen numbers lower than they
have been since the 1960s - a total of 667 homicides last year.
</P>
<P>
   This year the 2.4 percent rise over the same period in 1999 is
an increase of only eight murders - 333 compared with 325 - in a
city of about 7.4 million people. And overall violent crime -
murder, rape, robbery, felony assault, burglary, grand larceny and
auto theft - is down 7.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Crime experts have attributed the decrease to the aging of baby
boomers, a keener sense of community, good citizenship and the
decreasing use of crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   This year's early concern about the murder rate stemmed in part
from a spate of livery cab driver murders, and two fatal police
shootings. Then things quieted down until just before Memorial Day,
when five Wendy's employees were killed during a robbery in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Homicides have increased greatly in two of the city's five
boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   Usually quiet Staten Island had 14 murders through June 25,
compared with five during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx also suffered an increase. After seeing murders drop
in 1999 by 17 percent, the rate through June 25 of this year is up
56.2 percent. Police say 100 people were slain in the Bronx during
the first half of 2000, compared to 64 during the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir started an initiative on March
17 to put more uniformed cops on Bronx streets, concentrating on
violence-prone areas.

<HEADLINE> With BC-NJ--OpSail 2000-NJ-Glance Patience-testing traffic delays expected at Liberty State Park </HEADLINE>
By DERRICK HENRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. - Liberty State Park, with its panoramic view of
New York Harbor, will be a prime location for viewing the parade of
tall ships that will sail into New York Harbor for America's
birthday bash on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But crowds expected to watch the ships from the park likely will
generate traffic delays that will test motorists' patience. State
police are forecasting traffic delays of two to four hours.
</P>
<P>
   More than 150 tall ships and classic sailing vessels are
expected to ply the waves into the harbor for OpSail 2000.
Organizers have said they expect a July 4 crowd of 4 million people
along the New York and New Jersey waterfronts. At Liberty State
Park, about 260,000 people are expected.
</P>
<P>
   ''Expect to be there for a long period of time,'' state police
Superintendent Col. Carson J. Dunbar Jr. said, referring to the
delays.
</P>
<P>
   State police said New Jersey Turnpike exits 14B and 14C, which
serve the park, will be closed to passenger vehicles on the Fourth
of July. Only shuttle buses and other support vehicles will be
allowed on the exits.
</P>
<P>
   Turnpike officials said they were prepared to close the Newark
Bay/Hudson County Extension if traffic becomes bad enough.
</P>
<P>
   No passenger vehicles will be allowed into the park from 10 p.m.
July 3 to 6 a.m. July 5, state police said. That means visitors on
Tuesday will have to walk into the park, use shuttle buses or NJ
Transit's Light Rail Service to the Liberty State Park Station,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Parking for shuttles will be at the North Bergen Park &AMP; Ride
lots near routes 495 and 3. Parking also has been set aside at the
Vince Lombardi Park &AMP; Ride on the New Jersey Turnpike near
Interchange 18, and at the Military Ocean Terminal in Bayonne off
Route 169. Parking at the park and ride lots will be free,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   NJ Transit is scheduled to provide shuttle service to the park
from the ocean terminal lot. Private carriers are scheduled to
provide shuttle service from the North Bergen and Vince Lombardi
lots.
</P>
<P>
   The Hudson-Bergen Light Rail will provide service from Bayonne
and Jersey City to the Liberty State Park Station, located about a
mile from the park.
</P>
<P>
   OpSail, which is expected to bring boats from 60 nations, is
combined with the International Naval Review, a flotilla of 40
modern warships from 23 navies.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Sail was established by President John F. Kennedy in
1961 to promote international relations and cultural exchange.
There have been only four other OpSail events: the 1964 New York
World's Fair, the U.S. Bicentennial in 1976, the Statue of Liberty
centennial in 1986 and the Christopher Columbus Quincentennial in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Ships from the OpSail flotilla last week made a stop in the
Delaware River along the New Jersey and Philadelphia waterfronts.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey for the first time will be represented by a ship in
OpSail. The A.J. Meerwald is a restored, 71 year-old Delaware bay
schooner. The former oyster dredge these days is a floating ecology
and maritime history classroom.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Dissident Stuck in Paris  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S.-based Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng
said Friday he was stuck in Paris after being refused boarding on a
U.S.-bound Air France plane because he carries no passport.
</P>
<P>
   Wei, in a telephone interview from Paris, said he had a U.S.
government document that would allow him to return to the United
States after a brief trip to Europe, but airport authorities
refused to accept it. Wei said he was contacting U.S. and French
officials to help him return after being turned back at the airport
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   An official at the State Department public affairs office said
the office had no immediate information on Wei's efforts to return.
Wei has an office in Washington and recently has been campaigning
against permanent trade status for China, a Clinton administration
priority.
</P>
<P>
   Wei said he has to travel with a document provided by the U.S.
government guaranteeing his re-entry because the Chinese government
will not issue him a passport. He spent 18 years in Chinese jails
before going into exile in the United States.

<HEADLINE> McCall approves Medicaid contract extension despite doubts  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - State Comptroller H. Carl McCall Friday
approved a two-year contract extension between the state and
Maximus Inc. despite his ''serious concerns'' about the company's
Medicaid managed care enrollment work.
</P>
<P>
   The $43 million contract amendments call for Maximus to continue
handling Medicaid managed care enrollments for the state Health
Department in New York City, and to extend the program to Nassau
and Suffolk counties on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   The state's current contract with Maximus was to expire at
midnight Friday. It was signed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said his review of the contract extension raised
questions in his mind of how accurate the information was which the
company was providing to Medicaid recipients. Those same concerns
were raised in 1999 by Mark Green, New York City's public advocate.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said he was also troubled that as of earlier this month,
information about Medicaid managed care was not available from
Maximus in languages other than English and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Health Care Financing Administration also raised
questions about the Maximus contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 670,000 people currently enrolled in Medicaid
managed care in New York state, about 390,000 in New York City.
State Health Commissioner Dr. Antonia Novello says she wants to
expand enrollments to 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nassau and Suffolk county enrollments are currently handled by
local social services officials.
</P>
<P>
   Maximus is not providing health care coverage or services in New
York, but is finding eligible Medicaid recipients and enrolling
them in managed care.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department is confident Maximus can do the job its
contract calls for and has been pleased with the responsiveness of
the company when problems or concerns have been pointed out,
department spokesman John Signor said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will continue to monitor and oversee Maximus operations as
we always have to ensure a Medicaid recipient receives quality
health care in managed care,'' Signor said.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman added that Health Department officials were
''amazed'' that McCall continues to raise concerns about Maximus
since the department believes it answered them months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are really old issues,'' Signor said. ''They have mostly
been taken care of.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCall spokeswoman Theresa Bourgeois said the comptroller's
office has been frustrated that although many of the problems with
Maximus have long been identified, the Health Department has not
guaranteed they would be corrected.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know the problems aren't new,'' she said. ''The problem is
they've failed to address them. But they have now agreed to address
the issues, which is why the comptroller agreed to let the contract
to go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Maximus, based in McLean, Va., is currently embroiled in a court
battle in New York City over the awarding of more than $100 million
in city welfare-to-work contracts to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Maximus is the nation's largest operator of welfare-to-work
programs for state and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from the company Friday.

<HEADLINE> 3 more dead birds in Bergen County test positive for West Nile virus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) - Three dead crows found this week in
Bergen County were infected with the West Nile virus, the county
said Friday, bringing to four the number of crows found carrying
the disease, which can kill humans.
</P>
<P>
   Humans get the virus from mosquitoes that have bitten infected
birds. Seven people died last year in New York, when the West Nile
strain of encephalitis first surfaced in the region, sickening
dozens.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a cause for concern, but not a cause for alarm,''
Bergen County executive William P. ''Pat'' Schuber said.
</P>
<P>
   He said no infected mosquitoes have been found in Bergen County,
which has the largest population of the state's 21 counties and is
next to New York.
</P>
<P>
   The crows were found on Sunday and Monday. The Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention on Friday confirmed that the birds
had the West Nile strain, Schuber said.
</P>
<P>
   Bergen County dispatched crews Friday to the neighborhoods where
the birds were found.
</P>
<P>
   One crew will use hand-held sprayers to apply larvaecide and
will treat catch basins in the area with larvaecide briquettes to
kill developing mosquitoes, Schuber said. Before that, another crew
will take larvae samples.
</P>
<P>
   There is no need yet to apply insecticide to kill adult
mosquitoes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the dead crows were found in Westwood, while the third
was in River Edge, where a virus-infected crow was found in early
June.
</P>
<P>
   Blood tests of the county's ''sentinel'' chickens have not found
signs of the virus, said Mark Guarino, director of the county
health department.
</P>
<P>
   Those caged birds are considered the most reliable indicator of
the presence of the virus. Unlike the crows, they cannot move from
place to place, so if they test positive for the virus, authorities
would know definitively that West Nile is present in Bergen County.
Other cages of sentinel chickens are located elsewhere in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the virus is here, it is here in a very limited way and has
not shown up in any surveillance yet,'' Guarino said.
</P>
<P>
   The county health department is monitoring hospitals and
clinics, but has not found the disease in any people, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Rockland County, N.Y., two dead crows have been found
to be infected with the West Nile virus this year.
</P>
<P>
   To date, 112 blood samples from sentinel chickens in all 21 New
Jersey counties have found no evidence of West Nile, said Dennis
McGowan, a spokesman for the state Department of Health and Senior
Services.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 170 mosquito pools from around the state have all
tested negative.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 191 dead crows and three dead pigeons from all counties
except Camden and Cape May, West Nile has only been found in the
four Bergen County crows, McGowan said.
</P>
<P>
   Bergen County has no plans for aerial spraying in residential
areas, which Schuber has said could cause more of a health risk
than it prevents. It uses helicopters to spray pesticides in marshy
areas that are not near neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The county has introduced fish that feed on mosquito larvae into
ponds and waterways, and is urging people to eliminate breeding
grounds for the mosquitoes by preventing standing water from
accumulating on their property.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Passes Colombia, Disaster Bill  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress completed an $11.2 billion measure
Friday financing Colombia's war against drugs, Pentagon needs and
U.S. disaster aid, four months after President Clinton requested a
package half that size.
</P>
<P>
   After resolving the last in a series of hurdles that nearly
upended the measure, the Senate gave final approval to the bill by
voice vote and lawmakers left town for their weeklong July Fourth
recess. The House assented to the bill on Thursday night, 306-110.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference between Clinton's $5.2 billion version
and Congress' was that lawmakers more than doubled his defense
request to $6.4 billion. But legislators also included hundreds of
millions for election-year, home-state projects ranging from New
York City's proposed Second Avenue subway to the crabbing industry
in Alaska, Washington state and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who said he will sign the bill, said in a speech Friday
in Englewood, N.J., that it was ''very, very important.''
</P>
<P>
   He was especially eager for its $1.3 billion to help equip and
train Colombian forces battling cocaine and heroin producers
controlling southern sections of the country. Though some lawmakers
warned of being dragged into a Vietnam-type of unwinnable war,
Clinton and House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said the money
would help combat drug use as home.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of the cocaine and most of the heroin that flows into the
bodies of the young people in America comes out of Colombia,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   As if mimicking the House's eleventh-hour problems on Thursday,
Senate passage came only after a pair of fiscal conservatives --
Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Phil Gramm, R-Texas -- threatened to
delay the vote for a week.
</P>
<P>
   They were demanding cuts in the bill that McCain said was
''incredibly full of unnecessary, unwarranted, unauthorized,
unmitigated pork.''
</P>
<P>
   Underlining the hardball that leaders were willing to play to
win passage of the measure, Senate Appropriations Committee
Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, circulated a letter to his
colleagues from Gen. John M. Keane, the Army's vice chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   It warned that unless the Army received $1.5 billion the bill
contained, it would ''break the Army's ability to remain solvent
and maintain a ready force'' for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is for military construction and emergencies. We need to
get this done,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, McCain and Gramm relented after leaders agreed that
in a future bill, they will roll back $6.3 billion in accounting
gimmicks the emergency measure contains.
</P>
<P>
   Those gimmicks -- such as shifting payment of some veterans'
benefits by a few days so they would be charged against this fiscal
year instead of next year -- were mostly designed to let lawmakers
squeeze extra spending into next year's budget.
</P>
<P>
   House passage had been delayed until Hastert, facing opposition
by Senate Democrats, agreed to withdraw language that would have
lifted food sanctions against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The final package contained $2 billion for the costs of U.S.
peacekeeping troops in Kosovo; $661 million to help New Mexico
recover from blazes that blackened Los Alamos and other
communities; and $350 million for fighting other wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   There was also $360 million to help North Carolina and other
states hit by last September's Hurricane Floyd and farm problems,
and $600 million to help low-income families pay their utility
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also managed to find $45 million to buy a Gulfstream
executive jet for the Coast Guard's commandant; $8.4 million to
help the White House reconstruct the lost e-mails that
congressional investigators are hunting; and $17.5 million to fix
some of the Capitol's numerous fire hazards.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also had $7 million to help Hawaiian fishing boats
avoid snagging sea turtles; $112 million to reimburse California,
Arizona, New Mexico and Texas for costs of dealing with illegal
immigrants and smuggling; and $2 million to help refurbish the rail
link between Danbury and Norwalk, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Senate voted 52-43 to pass its $352 billion
version of the fiscal 2001 spending bill for the departments of
Labor, Education and Health and Human Services. Differences with a
smaller House version must now be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has threatened to veto that bill, which cuts his
requests for hiring teachers and for social services. It would also
block proposed rules aimed at reducing workplace injuries, and
contains GOP-written patients'-rights provisions the administration
says are inadequate.

<HEADLINE> Spending Bill Blocks Water Rules  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation that received final congressional
approval Friday would block federal regulators from moving forward
with a program to curb runoff from farms and businesses that
pollutes the nation's waterways.
</P>
<P>
   A provision in an $11 billion emergency spending bill that
passed the Senate Friday would prevent the Environmental Protection
Agency from implementing the program before October 2001, the start
of the government's 2002 budget year. President Clinton is expected
to sign the legislation, which provides money for the Pentagon,
drug fighting in Colombia and other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ''EPA regards this as another anti-environmental assault by the
congressional leadership against the administration's efforts to
bring cleaner, healthier water to all Americans,'' agency spokesman
Dave Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA provision was put in the bill ''late in the game without
warning,'' said Linda Ricci, a spokeswoman for the White House
budget office. She said the administration prevented lawmakers from
attaching several other provisions that it also considered bad for
the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Under EPA's proposed program, states would be given 15 years
develop plans for cleaning up every waterway that fails to meet
water quality standards. EPA estimates more than 20,000 streams and
lakes don't meet water-quality standards, or about 40 percent of
the nation's lakes, rivers and streams.
</P>
<P>
   Landowners would be required to get pollution-discharge permits
if the EPA found they were contributing to nearby water quality
problems and if a state had failed to draft an adequate plan for
improving water quality.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials said they had intended to implement the program
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits have imposed deadlines on some states to develop the
cleanup plans for rivers and streams. Only 1,300 of the estimated
40,000 needed plans had been approved by EPA as of last year, the
General Accounting Office said.
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials say it would be up to each state to decide what
landowners would have to do to control pollutants, and logging
operations have been dropped from the program. The proposal still
has faced strong criticism from farm-state lawmakers of both
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is overwhelming opposition across the country to the
EPA's proposals,'' said Rep. Larry Combest, R-Texas, chairman of
the House Agriculture Committee. ''The sheer fact that independent
scientists, farmers, foresters and environmentalists have all urged
withdrawal of these rules should give the EPA pause.''
</P>
<P>
   An Agriculture Department official told Combest's committee this
week that the EPA program was so unpopular with farm interests that
it had become the ''new four-letter word in rural America.''

<HEADLINE> Gov't To Strip College Contract  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a string of security lapses, the Energy
Department gave notice Friday it intends to strip the University of
California of its security and some management responsibilities
involving nuclear weapons programs at Los Alamos and another
government research lab.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson told the university its
contracts for managing the Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore labs
''must be restructured ... to make much-needed improvements to
security and other facility operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said in an interview that the university ''will still
be actively involved'' in scientific aspects of the nuclear weapons
programs, but some other management responsibilities, especially
security, would transferred elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring was expected to be worked out by September as
part of a renegotiation of the government's contract with the
university, Richardson said. He called the university's performance
in managing security at the weapons labs unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said it was important to keep the university's
''strong science and academic expertise'' as part of the weapons
program ''so weapons scientists feel comfortable for their
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations will begin immediately to start the process of
splitting management responsibilities at both the Los Alamos
National Laboratory in New Mexico and the Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory in California, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   The university, which has managed the nuclear weapons program at
Los Alamos since 1943 and the beginning Manhattan Project, which
exploded America's first nuclear device in the New Mexico desert,
has come under sharp criticism for security lapses in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The two-month disappearance of two computer hard drives from a
vault at the Los Alamos lab caused a growing number of lawmakers in
Congress to question whether a university atmosphere can mix with
security needs of the nuclear weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's still a culture of lax security,'' Richardson said
Friday, referring to the government laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   The government contract with the University of California
expires in 2002. Department officials said the contract is expected
to be re-negotiated this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The department will immediately begin negotiations with the
university to bring into their operations specific security and
management expertise to implement (security) improvements,'' the
department said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The new chief of DOE's nuclear weapons agency, Undersecretary
John Gordon, former deputy CIA director, was charged with
overseeing the contract renegotiating and to address with the
university ''the serious shortcomings ... at our weapons
laboratories,'' the department said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson has expressed outrage over the disappearance of the
two hard drives, containing nuclear secrets from a highly secured
Los Alamos laboratory vault. He was even more incensed by not
having learned of the security breach for nearly a month after it
became known to some Los Alamos scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The incident prompted demands in Congress for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Richardson also was highly critical of the
university's handling of a sophisticated laser program at the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. After
repeatedly assuring the $1 billion laser program was on schedule
and within budget, Richardson was told without warning there would
be a $300 million cost overrun and substantial delays.
</P>
<P>
   The University of California manages both Los Alamos and
Lawrence Livermore.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Richardson dismissed calls for his resignation
as political rhetoric and said he will ''absolutely not'' step down
over the security lapses at the Los Alamos weapons lab.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't walk away from a fight,'' he said on NBC's ''Today.''

<HEADLINE> Documents Show U.S. Filmmaker Shot  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An informant told the U.S. Embassy in Chile in
1987 that an American filmmaker killed in the tumultuous aftermath
of a 1973 military coup was shot by Chilean soldiers because he was
judged to be a ''foreign extremist,'' according to government
documents made public Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The source of the information was not disclosed, and the
documents indicated the embassy was unable to determine whether the
information was credible.
</P>
<P>
   The American was Charles Horman, whose murder in the
blood-filled post-coup period was the subject of a 1982 movie,
''Missing.'' The information received by the embassy about the case
was contained in a release of 505 previously classified documents,
most from State Department files.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Horman, the documents contain information about
the murder of American journalist Frank Teruggi, also in September
1973; and Boris Weisfeiler, a Russian emigre and mathematics
professor who disappeared in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Attending a news conference at which the files were released,
Joyce Horman, Charles Horman's widow, said she was disappointed
that the mystery about her husband's death remains.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not found the answer,'' she said. ''Our quest is not
over.''
</P>
<P>
   The embassy was told, the documents said, that Horman was
arrested at his home in Santiago on Sept. 18, 1973, one week after
President Salvador Allende was deposed in the coup by Gen. Augusto
Pinochet. Allende was killed in the coup.
</P>
<P>
   The Chilean source's first contact with the embassy occurred in
February 1987, more than 13 years after Horman's death. He told the
embassy that Horman was taken to the National Stadium after
interrogation the day after his arrest and was shot the following
evening.
</P>
<P>
   An April 27, 1987, memo from the embassy in Santiago to the
State Department reported that the home where Horman was staying
was reputed to be housing ''extremists,'' and documents found there
confirmed this suspicion, the informant said.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy memo continues, ''According to (name blacked out),
the authorities at the stadium did not know that Horman was an
American since his paperwork arrived after his death, and his poor
knowledge of Spanish made it difficult for him to understand and
answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   ''They only know that he was a foreigner and an 'extremist.' The
body was taken from the stadium and left at a location to create
the idea that he had been killed in a firefight with the
military.''
</P>
<P>
   The embassy also was told that Brig. Pedro Espinoza, a top
commander in Pinochet's security service, approved Horman's
killing. A Chilean tribunal convicted Espinoza in 1994 in the death
of Orlando Letelier, killed on a Washington street in 1976 by a
bomb placed by Chilean agents.
</P>
<P>
   Several pages of the documents address whether the embassy
source was providing legitimate information.
</P>
<P>
   A May 1987 memo to the embassy from then-Undersecretary of State
Michael Armacost said: ''We have serious doubts about (name blacked
out) credibility. ... He could be a government of Chile plant
intended to entrap embassy personnel, a sophisticated visa-shopper
or absolutely legitimate.''

<HEADLINE> US: Mideast Talks Based on UN Rules  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department said Friday negotiations
between Israel and the Palestinians were based on U.N. Security
Council resolutions calling on Israel to yield territory it won in
the 1967 Mideast war in exchange for secure borders.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's our view that all negotiations should be based on
Resolutions 242 and 338, all negotiations between Israel and the
Arabs, including the negotiations between the Israelis and the
Palestinians,'' the State Department spokesman Richard Boucher
said, referring to resolutions adopted in 1967 and 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the framework that we've always worked in, and it's the
one we believe we should continue to work in,'' Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   He made the statement in response to a ruling in Jerusalem by
Israel's attorney general Eliyakim Rubinstein that the Palestinian
Authority could not lay claim to the West Bank, Gaza and east
Jerusalem under the resolutions because Yasser Arafat's
self-government did not exist at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem and Egypt held
Gaza before the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   Rubinstein said while the resolutions referred to an Israeli
pullback to ''secure and recognized borders,'' there was never an
international border between Israel and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In Ramallah, West Bank, Arafat warned that Rubinstein's ruling
poses a ''real danger'' to peace. ''The Israeli attempt to ignore
resolution 242 poses a real danger and real threat to the peace
process,'' Arafat told his Cabinet, according to official minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The 1967 resolution was the product of intricate negotiations,
with Israel succeeding in avoiding any reference to all the
territory it had captured during the war. Instead, the resolution,
which was duplicated after the 1973 Mideast war, referred only to
''territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Israeli authorities insist Israel has already complied with
the resolutions by relinquishing Sinai to Egypt in a 1967 peace
treaty. Sinai amounts to most of the land the Arabs lost in the
war.
</P>
<P>
   On another touchy issue, the State Department again appeared to
criticize Arafat for his statements declaring he will establish a
state if Israel did not agree to one through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly, the department has urged the Palestinians and Israel
to avoid provocative rhetoric and actions. However, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright did not repeat the admonition on publicly
on her trip to Israel and the West Bank this week.
</P>
<P>
   But Boucher on Friday said that negotiations between Israel and
the Palestinians ''were based on mutuality, they were not based on
unilateral decision-making, and we would be against unilateral
declarations.''
</P>
<P>
   Boucher added: ''We've always urged the parties to help create
an environment where it's conducive to an agreement. So we're
always looking for the parties to help do that.''

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Up 89; Dow Gains 50  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks ended a difficult second quarter with a
burst of buying Friday as institutional investors bought the year's
big winners and discarded underperforming issues.
</P>
<P>
   Rallying in the final hour of trading, the Dow Jones industrial
average erased a small loss and finished up 49.85 at 10,447.89. For
the week, the Dow added 43.14.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, lifted by computer chips and
semiconducter stocks, rose 88.88 to 3,966.11. The Nasdaq gained
120.77 for the week.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also closed higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was up 12.21 at 1,454.60.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are seeing major window dressing here,'' said Scott Bleier,
chief investment strategist at Prime Charter. He was referring to
the strategy of portfolio managers to buy high-performing stocks at
the end of each quarter to impress clients. Two examples: Drugmaker
Pfizer rose $1.329 or 3 percent, to $47.563 on the New York Stock
Exchange, and Cisco jumped $2.375, or 4 percent, to $65.563 on the
Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   While the major market indexes rose, advancers barely outpaced
decliners on the NYSE, reflecting investor anxiety that's been
evident for months. It was the third heaviest trading day ever on
the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Prices were mixed for much of Friday's session after mixed news
about the strength of the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Commerce Department reported that Americans' incomes
in May rose twice as fast as their spending, pushing the nation's
personal savings rate up to its highest level since the start of
the year. This suggests consumers may be backing away from their
buying binge of the last year.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign that economic growth remains robust, the
Purchasing Management Association of Chicago said its index of
business activity in the Midwest rose more than expected. The
report is considered a precursor of the national purchasing
managers' report due out Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Traders continue to look for signs that the economy will cool
off to a more sustainable growth rate to contain inflation and keep
the Federal Reserve from boosting interest rates as it has done six
times in the past year. The Fed kept rates steady at its meeting
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Investors worry that additional interest rate hikes will slow
the economy and hurt corporate profits. In the last few days,
dozens of companies have warned of disappointing profits.
</P>
<P>
   The latest was insurer American Financial Group, whose stock
fell $1.25 to $25.688 after announcing that its second-quarter
earnings would fall below expectations. Also anticipating
lower-than-expected earnings was Hooper Holmes, which conducts
physicals for life insurers. Its stock fell $2.125 to $8.
</P>
<P>
   ''Inflation remains the key to this market, but corporate
earnings right now are the center stage,'' said Alan Ackerman,
senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. ''We will start seeing a
lot of earnings in the next few weeks. The disappointments will be
a disaster and good earnings will help stocks hold or move to
higher levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer chip stocks moved higher after the Semiconductor
Industry Association said worldwide chip sales reached an all-time
high of $15.8 billion in May, up 39.8 percent from $11.3 billion a
year ago. That helped pushed Rambus up $2.06 to $103.
</P>
<P>
   JDS Uniphase rose $3.50 to $119.875 after being added to
PaineWebber's ''Highlighted Stocks'' list.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow was carried by Wal-Mart, up $3.125 at $57.25, and United
Technologies, up $4.125 at $58.625.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks suffered through intense volatility during the second
quarter amid concerns about interest rates and the growing belief
that many high-tech stocks were extremely overvalued. The high-tech
dominated Nasdaq plunged during the quarter, dropping 37 percent
from the all-time high of 5,048.62 it reached March 10, before
recovering ground.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq ended the first half down 2.54 percent from its Dec.
31 close.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow finished the first half of the year down 9 percent, and
is off 11 percent from its high of 11,722.98 reached Jan. 14. The
Dow has struggled amid Microsoft's legal troubles and financial
services companies feeling the effects of rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was heavy Friday, the day before a long weekend for many
investors who plan to skip Monday's abbreviated trading session.
U.S. financial markets will close three hours early Monday and be
closed Tuesday in observance of Independence Day.
</P>
<P>
   Composite volume on the NYSE came to 1.66 billion shares as of 4
p.m., down from 1.30 billion in Thursday's session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 4.65 at 517.23.
</P>
<P>
   In overseas trading, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.37
percent, Germany's DAX index was up 0.34 percent, Britain's FT-SE
100 was up 1.18 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.71 percent.

<HEADLINE> Trenton man makes People's eligible bachelor list  </HEADLINE>
By J.J. THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON (AP) - Jeff Eppenstine is one hot package that delivers
- guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   People Magazine named the UPS deliveryman from Chambersburg one
of America's 100 most eligible bachelors. In the edition that hit
newsstands Friday, his photo appears along with Hollywood hunks
George Clooney, Ben Affleck and Freddie Prinze Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Eppenstine, 31, heard about the contest through friends of a
co-worker, but never expected to make the final cut. He and his
relatives were ''flipping out'' when they saw his photo and short
write-up in the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was cracking up,'' he said Friday. ''There were all these
guys - celebrities - and they were showing me (with them).''
</P>
<P>
   He's already been mentioned on ''Entertainment Tonight,''
''Dateline'' and ''Live with Regis and Kathie Lee.''
</P>
<P>
   The Morrisville (Pa.) High School graduate spent most of his
Friday morning at the New Jersey shore handling calls from the
media.
</P>
<P>
   ''My friends can't believe it because the phone keeps ringing,''
he said. ''I never thought it would happen to me. I might as well
enjoy it while I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the attention, Eppenstine said he's not fighting off
single women. Although People Magazine posted an e-mail address for
anyone interested in contacting him, he's only had one response so
far.
</P>
<P>
   ''It said something like, 'You're too hot for words. Love,
Mom.'''
</P>
<P>
   UPS, meanwhile, doesn't mind the attention its employee is
getting. The company is excited for him, said Laurie Valle,
communications supervisor, but she contends most of its employees
look pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think a lot of workers at UPS are always (out and) about and
it keeps them in shape,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Eppenstine said he spends free time during the week working on
his house. He also goes to Philadelphia night clubs and works as a
bartender at Bob's Woodside Pub in Robbinsville.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine located the bachelors through a four-month search,
with employees talking to their friends and family members,
according to People's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Eppenstine said he learned of the search through a coworker's
future sister-in-law, who knows a People editor. He was interviewed
several times and was scheduled for a two-hour photo shoot.
</P>
<P>
   When the magazine called for follow-up interviews, he was warned
not to get his hopes up. Eppenstine found out about a week ago that
he had made the list when someone called to check his name for a
photo caption.
</P>
<P>
   The frenzy began a few days later, but Eppenstine said he's not
letting it go to his head.
</P>
<P>
   ''On Monday I'll still be back at work.''

<HEADLINE> If weather cooperates, July Fourth holiday could be 4-day event  </HEADLINE>
By NINA RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - With sunny skies predicted through Monday
for the entire state, some transportation officials in New Jersey
think the July Fourth holiday weekend will turn into a four-day
fiesta.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Ingoglia, a spokesman for the Garden State Parkway, said
his agency predicted 4.7 million vehicles will travel the parkway
between Friday and Tuesday. That's about 100,000 more cars than the
last July Fourth weekend. Some 1.5 million vehicles travel the
parkway on an average work day, he said.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Turnpike officials are predicting 3.3 million cars
will travel its 148-mile stretch between Friday and Wednesday.
Their figures assume vacationers will go back to work on Monday,
head out again on Tuesday and return home on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's going to happen on Monday is questionable,'' said
Vincent L. Leonetti, deputy executive director of the South Jersey
Transportation Authority, which runs the Atlantic City Expressway.
Will visitors who spend the holiday at the Jersey Shore return to
work on Monday and come back on Tuesday?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy travel is expected despite higher gasoline prices this
year. Regular unleaded gasoline averages $1.57 in New Jersey. That
means a typical two-car family faces an increase of about $600 in
their annual fuel expenditures over last year's prices, the
American Automobile Association said.
</P>
<P>
   About 32 million Americans are expected to use their cars on the
Fourth of July weekend, the AAA said. The organization also said
that number is nearly 4 percent higher than last year and the
greatest one-year jump for the holiday since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Ingoglia said the July Fourth weekend is very dependent on the
weather.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it rains, people will go to a movie or move their barbecue
inside instead of going to the shore.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service predicted possible thunderstorms on
Tuesday for every part of the state except the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the weather, there will be plenty to do, no matter
when the holiday weekend begins or ends.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic City area is ''going to be a jamming place,'' said
Susan Ricciardi of the Atlantic City Convention &AMP; Visitors
Authority. ''The Boardwalk and the beach are a natural attraction
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Northern New Jersey will have attractions for those who don't
want to fight the shore traffic.
</P>
<P>
   More than 150 tall ships and classic sailing vessels are
expected to glide into the New York Harbor for OpSail 2000.
Organizers have said they expect a July Fourth crowd of four
million people along the New York and New Jersey waterfronts. At
Liberty State Park, about 260,000 people are expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Some of New Jersey's largest concert halls have sold out shows
for the extended weekend. PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel is
hosting the classic rock 'n roll group The Who on Saturday and teen
pop sensation Britney Spears on Sunday and Monday at its
17,000-seat open-air facility.
</P>
<P>
   The E-Centre in Camden will supply the alternative sound of
Phish on Monday and Tuesday and Spears on Wednesday at its
25,000-seat arena.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Springfield will perform Saturday at the Meadowlands Fair,
held in the Giants Stadium parking lot through July 9.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Al Della Fave, spokesman for the New Jersey State Police,
said troopers will be in full force over the holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be high visibility to get people to think twice''
before they get behind the wheel, said Della Fave. Eight people
died over the last July Fourth weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Della Fave added that troopers will be on the lookout for
fireworks. Possession of fireworks - Roman candles, M-80s, cherry
bombs and even sparklers - carry a maximum penalty of a $1,000 fine
and 30 days in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Troopers confiscate between six and eight tons of illegal
explosives each year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The State Police marine bureau will also be patrolling the
waters, looking for those who are driving aggressively or under the
influence of drugs or alcohol. In New Jersey, boaters must be at
least 16 and have a boating safety certificate.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from New Jersey power utilities said they are not
predicting any problems during the holiday weekend. Mild
temperatures and low humidity are expected to keep demand down.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're actually anticipating low demand over the weekend
because the weather won't be (extreme) at all,'' said Kathleen
Ellis, a spokeswoman for PSE&AMP;G, the state's largest utility.
</P>
<P>
   Customers probably won't have the same problems this summer as
they did last July Fourth weekend, when blackouts occurred
throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said most of the problems were caused by the distribution
system. While the utility's system performed well last year, she
said PSE&AMP;G made major investments in the areas where it was the
weakest.
</P>
<P>
   ''Does that mean nothing will happen? Of course we can't say
that,'' Ellis said. ''But we are anticipating an eventless
summer.''

<HEADLINE> Gazprom Names Kremlin Aide Chairman  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Shareholders in Russia's natural gas monopoly
Gazprom named a top Kremlin official Friday to head its board of
directors, a move that could herald tighter government control over
the country's largest company.
</P>
<P>
   Investors also unexpectedly elected two shareholder rights
advocates to the company's board in what many observers considered
a sign of improved corporate governance.
</P>
<P>
   Gazprom is the top source of revenues for the federal budget.
Europe depends on the Russian company for more than a quarter of
its gas.
</P>
<P>
   Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of the Kremlin administration who
is considered to have close ties to President Vladimir Putin,
replaced Viktor Chernomyrdin as chairman of the board.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, who founded Gazprom 11 years ago, was Boris
Yeltsin's longest-serving prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Medvedev gave few signs about his priorities, saying only that
he would ''fulfill the laws of the company and protect the
interests of shareholders, first and foremost the government.''
</P>
<P>
   The shareholder rights advocates are Burckhard Bergmann, deputy
head of Germany's Ruhrgas and the first foreigner on the board, and
Boris Fyodorov, a former finance minister and current parliamentary
deputy.
</P>
<P>
   Ruhrgas owns 4 percent of Gazprom. Fyodorov is considered a
strong defender of the rights of minority shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Following the appointments, Gazprom shares jumped 10 percent to
25.5 cents on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Gazprom continues to face financial pressures as a result of
declining output and difficulty in collecting payments from
deadbeat customers.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Executive Rem Vyakhirev said 80 percent of the company's
gas comes from fields with declining productivity.
</P>
<P>
   The government, owner of a controlling 38.37 percent stake, won
four seats in addition to Medvedev's: Economics and Trade Minister
German Gref, State Property Minister Farit Gazizullin, Deputy Prime
Minister Viktor Khristenko, and Antimonopoly Policies &AMP; Enterprise
Support Minister Ilya Uzhanov.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton raises $5.1 million; Lazio $4.5 million  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton's Republican rival
for the U.S. Senate, Rick Lazio, has been raising money at a much
faster rate than the first lady for the six weeks he's been in the
race, figures released Friday showed.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman from Long Island has collected more than $4.5
million since entering the race on May 20, his campaign aides said.
Lazio had earlier raised $3.5 million for a possible Senate run
before suspending that effort last year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton aides said Friday that she had raised $5.1
million over the past three months, boosting her total collections
to almost $18 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very excited,'' Lazio campaign spokesman Dan McLagan
said as he reported the new numbers. ''We had only half a quarter
to raise this money.''
</P>
<P>
   In the all important bottom line of cash in hand, how much each
campaign has available to spend immediately, Lazio reported $5.4
million and Clinton, $6.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio fund raising over six weeks works out to $750,000 a
week compared with $425,000 a week for the first lady over the 12
weeks she was at work over the second quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson questioned the rate of
fund raising comparison, saying some of Lazio's $4.5 million
certainly came from before May 20 because the congressman had to
have been raising money for an expected House re-election race.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a very, very small percentage,'' McLagan said. The
Lazio spokesman said he did not have such figures available Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's not a bad start, but he's going to have to do a lot
better,'' said Hank Sheinkopf, a veteran New York Democratic
strategist, when told about Lazio's effort.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has said he will need $15 million or more for the race,
although some of his top advisers think he may need twice that
amount to beat the better-known first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton financial advisers have said they expect to raise at
least $25 million for the race.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides sought to portray themselves as the underdog in the
money chase.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton campaign manager Bill de Blasio said, ''Rick Lazio and
the national Republican fund-raising machine will outraise us.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio campaign manager Bill Dal Col said, ''We know we will be
outspent ... but we will have enough to wage our underdog effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio entered the race when Mayor Rudolph Giuliani withdrew from
the contest after being diagnosed with prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving the Senate race, Giuliani had raised more than
$19 million through the end of March. He is refunding about $2.8
million of that to donors, along with letters urging them to send
the money to Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's former campaign manager, Bruce Teitelbaum, said
Friday that between the end of March and May 19 when the mayor quit
the race, his campaign had collected additional donations of more
than $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum said there has been no decision made yet on what to
do with Senate campaign money not refunded to donors. Both state
and national Republican campaign committees are hoping to get at
least a large share of whatever money the New York City mayor has
left.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio had been preparing for a possible Senate run last year
until Gov. George Pataki asked him to bow out in favor of Giuliani.
At that point, Lazio had already raised about $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign figures being trumpeted Friday cover April, May and
June. The candidates' reports, providing details of that fund
raising that the campaigns did not provide Friday, are supposed to
be filed with the Federal Election Commission by July 15.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton began raising money for the Senate race one year ago.
She collected more than $8 million last year and $4.7 million in
the first three months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an extremely strong filing, and we are very pleased,''
de Blasio said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While the campaigns were tallying up their donations, Sen. John
McCain attacked the Democrats for launching a new round of
television ads criticizing Lazio's congressional record. The ads
were paid for by ''soft money'' donations to the federal Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   McCain noted that he and Lazio voted this week for legislation
sent to President Clinton that would require public disclosure of
donors to some political committees that have previously been able
to keep their donor lists secret.
</P>
<P>
   ''So what were Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party doing
while Rick Lazio was helping lead the fight for reform?'' McCain
asked in a statement. ''They were announcing a $400,000 soft-money
ad campaign paid for by special interest money to attack Lazio.''

<HEADLINE> White House Turns Over E-Mail Tapes  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House has yet to recover any missing
e-mails being sought by investigators and is turning over backup
tapes that might contain the messages to Independent Counsel Robert
Ray and the Justice Department, a judge disclosed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI will now step in and try to retrieve some of the missing
e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   The latest twist in the controversy over the missing e-mails
played out in the courtroom of U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth,
who is presiding over a civil case involving the messages.
</P>
<P>
   The White House belatedly disclosed earlier this year that
thousands of e-mails, including some from Vice President Al Gore's
office, were not properly archived because of a computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the messages were never reviewed by White House
lawyers to determine if they should have been turned over under
subpoena to investigations ranging from impeachment and Whitewater
to campaign fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential aides have tried for months to retrieve the
messages from the backup tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, Ray and Justice are investigating whether the e-mail
problem was an innocent mistake, as the White House contends, or
part of an effort to obstruct their investigations. The White House
denies wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   At a court hearing Friday, Lamberth authorized presidential
aides to release some of the computer tapes to Justice Department
campaign finance investigators.
</P>
<P>
   A government lawyer told the judge the White House is running
into technical problems that will indefinitely delay the retrieval
of missing e-mail. The White House had hoped to have the first
batch of e-mail ready for investigators by June.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail will be provided to investigators in a ''rolling
production,'' Elizabeth Shapiro, the Justice Department attorney
representing the White House, told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   ''But when does it start rolling?'' Lamberth asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now you've got me,'' Shapiro answered.
</P>
<P>
   The Independent Counsel's office and the Justice Department
''came to us and said the FBI might have a faster way to do this,''
said White House spokesman Jake Siewert. ''The FBI is going to take
a look and see if they can recover some of the e-mail from the
tapes. We finalized an agreement earlier this week to do that.
They'll take a test batch and look at them.''
</P>
<P>
   Siewert said the e-mail recovery process is complicated because
outside contractors hired by the White House are ''building the
software'' to recapture the messages and ''this is not software
that is commercially available.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't predict when it will be completed,'' Siewert said.
</P>
<P>
   The chief Republican investigator on the House committee probing
fund-raising criticized the White House for further delays.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very disappointed that the White House has not been
able to move forward with greater dispatch,'' said Jim Wilson,
chief investigator for the House Government Reform Committee.
''Given these new developments, at a very minimum, they should have
kept Congress informed of the fact that they were making no
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Just two days ago, the committee sent to Attorney General Janet
Reno a letter complaining her department had not interviewed
numerous key witnesses in its probe of the missing e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   The White House e-mail controversy erupted when two former White
House computer experts said that much of the White House's e-mail
had not been stored in computer archives.
</P>
<P>
   The White House hired outside companies to pull the e-mails off
computer backup tapes, but the preliminary copying of the tapes
hasn't started, the judge was told Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro explained the machinery used to copy the tapes is ''not
able to withstand the amount of copying'' necessary for the 3,000
backup tapes in question.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is clear the Clinton-Gore White House is attempting to
delay the e-mail production until after the election,'' said Larry
Klayman, the head of the conservative group Judicial Watch that
brought the lawsuit against the Clinton administration that
prompted Friday's hearing.

<HEADLINE> Spain Send Stuffed Body to Africa  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- The stuffed body of spear-carrying
19th-century bushman, whose display in a Spanish museum sparked
international protest, will be sent home to Botswana to be buried.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit has been on display since 1916 at a museum in
Banyoles, a town 70 miles northeast of Barcelona. The Spanish
government and the town signed an agreement Friday to return the
body to the southern African nation in the next couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was not very appropriate to exhibit a human being of the
black race in a Western and developed city,'' Banyoles Mayor Pedro
Bosch said after the signing.
</P>
<P>
   Some African countries, the United Nations and the Organization
of African Unity complained that the exhibit was racist. Two years
ago, the body was removed by order of the Foreign Ministry to
prevent a diplomatic incident.
</P>
<P>
   A joint statement by the Spanish government and the town said
the body had been removed out of ''respect to the thousands of
African immigrants who live in this town.''
</P>
<P>
   Banyoles and the surrounding region in Catalonia have the
highest concentration of African immigrants in Spain. Most work on
farms in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly, French taxidermist Edouard Verraux stole the body
from a grave in Botswana just after the man's death in the late
19th century. Barcelona naturalist Francisco de Darder acquired the
body from Verraux to add to a collection that later became the
Darder Museum of Natural History in Banyoles.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish government will organize the return of the body to
Botswana, and will pay for its repatriation. The exact date of its
return was not set.

<HEADLINE> Mexico: Record Election Observers  </HEADLINE>
By MEGAN LARDNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Former President Jimmy Carter arrived here
Friday to join 860 foreign observers and 10,000 local poll watchers
-- a record number -- in monitoring this weekend's presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The key question for the monitors: Will what they see Sunday be
enough to judge the fairness of the vote?
</P>
<P>
   The task is staggering. They'll cover fewer than 10 percent of
the 113,589 polling places nationwide -- while history suggests that
fraud, if it occurs, will be scattered, secretive and confusing.
The country's stricter new electoral laws could also spawn new ways
of cheating the system.
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate the presidential race is a tight contest between
opposition candidate Vicente Fox and Francisco Labastida, whose
party has governed Mexico for 71 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''In closer races, problems take on greater significance,'' said
Kenneth Wollack, president of the National Democratic Institute and
part of its 40-member observer team.
</P>
<P>
   But Wollack said he has observed elections around the world, and
''it is rare'' for fraud, by itself, to determine the result of a
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Carter received his observer credentials Friday, and was
planning to meet with President Ernesto Zedillo and the three top
candidates on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A wealth of slang terms have developed over decades to describe
the traditional forms of fraud here. Opposition candidate
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas told The Associated Press this week: ''We know
what to look for: the 'crazy mice,' the 'merry-go-round,' the
'ballot tacos.'''
</P>
<P>
   The first term refers to changing the location of polling
places, making voters run around like crazy mice; the second, to a
group of voters who ride around, as on a merry-go-round, from one
polling booth to the next, voting at each. A ballot taco is a
rolled-up sheaf of ballots -- all marked in favor of a single party
-- dropped surreptitiously into a ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   But that kind of open fraud is probably a thing of the past,
according to the Federal Electoral Institute, the independent
agency charged with overseeing the vote.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to stiff penalties for such acts, representatives of
the major parties will be present at most polling places to detect
such practices, and curtains around voting booths will let voters
fill out their ballots in secret.
</P>
<P>
   The electoral agency has also instituted a public education
campaign to remind Mexicans that their vote is secret.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't expect fraud in the old forms, but we do expect to
see more irregularities in rural areas,'' said Hugo Almada of the
Civic Alliance, whose estimated 4,000 poll watchers will be the
largest single observer group.

<HEADLINE> Journalists: Fox Campaign Hostile  </HEADLINE>
By AMPARO TREJO
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Journalists covering Mexico's top opposition
candidate accuse the campaign's media team of hostility, including
pressuring a radio network to reassign one reporter and physically
threatening another.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the journalists' compaints revolve areound Martha
Sahagun, the media coordinator for Vicente Fox's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters say Sahagun has made calls to editors to ask that
reporters be reassigned, and has threatened to withdraw advertising
unless they heeded her.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists who made the accusations to The Associated Press
included Georgina Morett of the newspaper Milenio, Fabiola Sanchez
of CNI television news, and Maria Eugenia Rojas of Radio Formula --
who was pulled from covering the campaign after an argument with
Sahagun. Several other reporters spoke to The AP on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The reporters say many of the problems are a result of the
inexperience of Fox's media team in a country where a single party
has held the presidency for 71 years, and where the news media
often have been used as a tool to discredit the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign of ruling-party candidate Francisco Labastida,
Fox's main rival, also has been accused of trying to influence the
news media, and some journalists said they were ordered by editors
to give biased coverage in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   In the Fox campaign, the discontent extends to a majority of
reporters following him, who say the campaign is routinely hostile
and unhelpful -- and at times has clearly crossed the line.
</P>
<P>
   In the most severe case, a reporter working for a newspaper with
a clear anti-Fox editorial line was threatened by two of the
candidate's bodyguards, according to other journalists who
witnessed the incidents and spoke only on condition of anonymity
for fear of retribution.
</P>
<P>
   Sahagun wouldn't directly confirm the threat, but said: ''I must
accept that there have been some incidents about which we have
talked with the affected parties and have issued an apology.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox apparently didn't know about the apology. He told The
Associated Press that he knew of no tensions with the news media,
adding: ''We respect the freedom of the press in an absolute
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Rojas was pulled off covering the campaign by Rogerio Azcarraga,
the owner of the radio network where she worked. Rojas said she was
taken off the story on May 24, right after she had a fight with
Sahagun.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president of operations for the radio network, Gabriel
Nunez, conceded that ''in response to a plea from the campaign
team, we sent another person.'' Sahagun refused to discuss the
matter, saying only that it had been resolved.

<HEADLINE> High court suppresses confession, orders new trial in 1991 murder  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The state Supreme Court ruled Friday that
the confession of a suspect in a 1991 North Brunswick rape and
murder should have been thrown out because he was illegally
arrested and interrogated for nine hours.
</P>
<P>
   New information about the case unearthed by police midway
through the interrogation was not enough to justify the tainted
confession that followed, the justices ruled in the unanimous
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Richard J. Chippero deserves to be retried, said the
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Chippero, of North Brunswick, was convicted of the July 23, 1991
rape and murder of his neighbor, Ermina Ross Tocci.
</P>
<P>
   Police interviewed the then-24-year-old after he was identified
by another neighbor as being in the vicinity of Tocci's mobile home
the day of the murder.
</P>
<P>
   During a five-week trial, an expert told the jury that Chippero
''underwent significant psychological alterations'' during the nine
hours he was held by police, and blanked out near the end. The
defendant has no recall of his taped confession, the expert said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the jury chose not to sentence Chippero to death, he
was sentenced to two life terms.
</P>
<P>
   He appealed his conviction, claiming he was arrested without
probable cause then fabricated his confession to appease
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The Appellate Division upheld the conviction and admissibility
of the confession, finding no flagrant police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   But the high court reversed the appeals court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''The eleventh-hour discovery by police officers of allegedly
new information ... is a weak reed on which to rest the state's
claim of intervening circumstances,'' the court wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Frank J. Pugliese said Friday that his client,
who is serving time at New Jersey State Prison in Trenton, was
''choked up'' when told the news.
</P>
<P>
   ''He cried a bit, but they were happy tears,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office chooses to retry him
without the benefit of the tainted confession, Chippero is
confident of acquittal, Pugliese said.
</P>
<P>
   Two telephone calls placed to the prosecutor's office by The
Associated Press on Friday were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant state Attorney General Anne Pascow said she was
disappointed in the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought the Appellate decision was fair,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The justices found fault with the appeals court ruling that the
length of time between the suspect's arrest and his confession
somehow diminished the illegal nature of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, ''a contrary rule would encourage police officers who
arrest without probable cause to conduct lengthy interrogations in
an effort to purge the unlawful arrest of its unconstitutional
taint,'' they wrote.

Lebanon court sends alleged bin Laden followers to jail
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Eight alleged followers of America's
most-wanted terror suspect, Osama bin Laden, were convicted Friday
on charges that included planning terrorist attacks. They were
sentenced to prison terms ranging from two weeks to five years.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese military court acquitted three suspects and
sentenced two more in absentia, one to 15 years and another to one
year.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects were accused of conspiring to carry out terrorist
acts and possessing weapons and detonators with the intent to use
them. Charges also included involvement in circulating counterfeit
money and forging passports.
</P>
<P>
   The trial began June 16 and all the suspects who appeared in
court pleaded innocence. The Military Tribunal, whose rulings
cannot be appealed, issued the sentences after four hours of
deliberations Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Of the eight who received prison terms, two were sentenced to
five years in prison. One woman received nine months, a man got six
months, three people received one month prison terms and one person
was sentenced to two weeks in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The trial in Beirut coincided with one of 28 terror suspects in
Jordan who are alleged to belong to a group associated with bin
Laden. They are charged with planning to attack U.S. and Israeli
tourists during New Year's celebrations in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, a Saudi-born millionaire, is wanted for the 1998
bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The bombings
killed 224 people. Bin Laden is thought to be in hiding in
Afghanistan.

	   ELMIRA, N.Y. (AP) - Fourteen graduated high school seniors will
answer to their peers, not to the criminal justice system, for
hazing three freshmen earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The students at Elmira Free Academy will be judged by the Elmira
Youth Court after parents of all the victims declined to press
charges. Two of the victims, paddled in a garage said all they want
is an apology.

   Chemung County District Attorney John Trice met with the accused
and their parents to explain the criminal charges they could have
faced for both paddling the students and just looking on, including
coercion and assault. Trice told the Elmira Star-Gazette he had
never before handled a high school hazing case.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Court Says Workers Can't Check Meat  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government meat inspectors must do hands-on
examinations of carcasses and can't leave the job to employees of
processing plants, an appeals court said Friday in ruling against
an experimental program supported by consumer advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, the Agriculture Department has pulled its
inspectors from slaughter lines in selected plants and assigned
them to do more testing for pathogens and to oversee the company
workers.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia ruled unanimously that federal laws require
meat to be inspected by USDA employees, not packing plant workers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government believes that federal employees fulfill their
statutory duty to inspect by watching others perform the task. One
might as well say that umpires are pitchers because they carefully
watch others throw baseballs,'' the court said.
</P>
<P>
   The American Federation of Government Employees, which
represents the department's inspectors, sued USDA in 1998 to stop
the project. But a federal judge allowed the department to go ahead
last fall, agreeing with USDA that its inspectors were not required
to handle every carcass so long as they kept an eye on the meat.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court decision sends the case back to the lower
court. Agriculture Department officials said they were disappointed
by the court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are confident that the products from these plants are safe
and wholesome,'' Beth Gaston, a spokeswoman for the department's
Food Safety and Inspection System said, referring to the 30 plants
in the program.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, we have not made any industrywide changes in the
slaughter inspection system and will only propose to do so if the
scientific data supports changes,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Government inspectors have traditionally stood at fixed points
along slaughter lines and checked carcasses for signs of disease or
infection. USDA officials say it's a better use of the inspectors'
time to sample for fecal contamination and harmful microbes than
handle the meat, since bacteria can't be detected by the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   Groups like Consumers Federation of America have supported the
program. But Bobby Harnage, president of the union, said the ruling
was ''a great victory for consumers. USDA is no longer allowed to
abdicate its responsibility for food safety.''
</P>
<P>
   At last 16 poultry plants had agreed to participate in the
program.

<HEADLINE> Europeans Feel Pinch at Gas Pump  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE STANLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Although gasoline prices traditionally are higher
on this side of the Atlantic, typically submissive European
consumers are clamoring for relief from worsening pain at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   From Britain to Hungary to Finland, the outrage at rising gas
prices sounds almost, well, American in its intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Prices are outrageous,'' seethed Budapest book publisher Tamas
Bekes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's madness,'' said Valerie Khoury, a housewife in suburban
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   European motorists are long accustomed to paying as much as four
times what Americans shell out for a tankful of gas, due to fuel
taxes that can add a staggering 80 percent to the retail gas price
in the region. Nonetheless, they have become more dependent on
their cars, for pleasure as much as for work.
</P>
<P>
   ''The car for Italians is a habit, a tradition, like
spaghetti,'' said Italian taxi driver Michele Di Russo at a filling
station in central Rome. ''Gas prices will not affect its usage.
The car is entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   As in the United States, where prices have soared in some areas
to more than $2 a gallon, recent increases in the price of crude
oil used to make gasoline are sending prices up. The cost of
unleaded gas has risen by 16 percent in France, 14 percent in Italy
and 11 percent in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   There are few signs that resentment at the increases is
ferocious enough to boil over into a consumer rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   ''People have been bludgeoned by one successive rise after
another. We're so used to them, we've become desensitized,'' said
Michael Johnson, spokesman for the Automobile Association of
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   According to Johnson's organization, the average price for a
gallon of unleaded gasoline in Britain this month is $4.94 -- more
than twice what Britons paid a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Norway is the only European nation with costlier gas, at $5.00 a
gallon, the AA said. France is the next most expensive, at $4.23,
followed by Italy, Germany, Portugal, Austria and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The difference from one country to the next is due mostly to
government taxes, which in Britain and France account for more than
80 percent of the price of gas. Finland had the next highest fuel
tax, at 78 percent, followed by Belgium and Poland at 75 percent
each, the AA said.
</P>
<P>
   This tax bite has left some motorists feeling passive and
powerless.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't really do anything about it. It's in the hands of the
government,'' said office worker Norah Lydon, who spoke as she
filled her tank in the London suburb of Edgware.
</P>
<P>
   An average 27 cents of every dollar that Americans spend at the
pump goes toward tax. Thus the tripling in world oil prices since
December 1998 has caused gasoline prices to spike more dramatically
in the United States than in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just not the big deal here that it is in the U.S. because
the price is masked by tax,'' said Jeremy Elden, an oil and gas
industry analyst at Lehman Brothers in London.
</P>
<P>
   Klaus Rehaag of the Paris-based International Energy Association
argued that the U.S.-style car culture is not as strong in Europe,
where large cities have good public transportation and are linked
by dense rail networks.
</P>
<P>
   But discontent over gas prices appears widespread and rising.
</P>
<P>
   ''Prices are just ridiculous,'' said Risto Hyvonen of Helsinki,
Finland. ''I don't drive any less now. But whereas before I used to
tank up at any old gas station, now I look for special offers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Finance Ministry in neighboring Sweden has received 80,000
letters in the past few months alone protesting its 70-plus percent
tax on gasoline, ministry spokesman Haakan Boberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Public pressure already has proven effective in Austria. Last
month, the Austrian state-owned oil company agreed to trim 2.5
cents off each gallon of unleaded gas after automobile clubs and
labor groups complained that the country's prices were among the
highest in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, costlier gas is forcing up prices for taxi rides,
pizza deliveries and even emergency visits from locksmiths.
</P>
<P>
   Some Europeans are economizing by planning errand trips more
carefully and taking buses or subways where convenient.
</P>
<P>
   But Czech businessman Martin Kukas spoke for many in the region
when he acknowledged his automobile dependency.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even if the price goes up further, there's nothing I can do,''
he said at a busy intersection in downtown Prague. ''I just need to
use the car.''

<HEADLINE> Gov't To Lose UC Role  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a string of security lapses, the Energy
Department gave notice Friday it intends to strip the University of
California of its security and some management responsibilities
involving nuclear weapons programs at Los Alamos and another
government research lab.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson told the university its
contracts for managing the Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore labs
''must be restructured ... to make much-needed improvements to
security and other facility operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said in an interview that the university ''will still
be actively involved'' in scientific aspects of the nuclear weapons
programs, but some other management responsibilities, especially
security, would transferred elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring was expected to be worked out by September as
part of a renegotiation of the government's contract with the
university, Richardson said. He called the university's performance
in managing security at the weapons labs unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ''The university welcomes the opportunity to work with DOE in
this effort and to create a path forward that meets all security
needs,'' Richard Atkinson, the university's president, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said it was important to keep the university's
''strong science and academic expertise'' as part of the weapons
program ''so weapons scientists feel comfortable for their
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations will begin immediately to start the process of
splitting management responsibilities at both the Los Alamos
National Laboratory in New Mexico and the Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory in California, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   The university, which has managed the nuclear weapons program at
Los Alamos since 1943 and the beginning Manhattan Project, which
exploded America's first nuclear device in the New Mexico desert,
has come under sharp criticism for security lapses in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The two-month disappearance of two computer hard drives from a
vault at the Los Alamos lab caused a growing number of lawmakers in
Congress to question whether a university atmosphere can mix with
security needs of the nuclear weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's still a culture of lax security,'' Richardson said
Friday, referring to the government laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   The government contract with the University of California
expires in 2002. Department officials said the contract is expected
to be re-negotiated this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The department will immediately begin negotiations with the
university to bring into their operations specific security and
management expertise to implement (security) improvements,'' the
department said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The new chief of DOE's nuclear weapons agency, Undersecretary
John Gordon, former deputy CIA director, was charged with
overseeing the contract renegotiating and to address with the
university ''the serious shortcomings ... at our weapons
laboratories,'' the department said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson has expressed outrage over the disappearance of the
two hard drives, containing nuclear secrets from a highly secured
Los Alamos laboratory vault. He was even more incensed by not
having learned of the security breach for nearly a month after it
became known to some Los Alamos scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The incident prompted demands in Congress for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Richardson also was highly critical of the
university's handling of a sophisticated laser program at the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. After
repeatedly assuring the $1 billion laser program was on schedule
and within budget, Richardson was told without warning there would
be a $300 million cost overrun and substantial delays.
</P>
<P>
   The University of California manages both Los Alamos and
Lawrence Livermore.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Richardson dismissed calls for his resignation
as political rhetoric and said he will ''absolutely not'' step down
over the security lapses at the Los Alamos weapons lab.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't walk away from a fight,'' he said on NBC's ''Today.''

<HEADLINE> Putin Offers Regional Compromise  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA CHARLTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin won new
parliamentary victories Friday in his bid to strengthen control
over independent-minded regions, but hinted he'd be willing to
soften the plan to appease angry provincial bosses.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has said reining in unruly provinces is necessary to mend
the economy and prevent Russia from breaking up, and has devised a
three-point proposal on how to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The lower house of parliament, or State Duma, passed one of the
provisions Friday: a bill that would allow Putin to remove elected
governors who were found to have violated federal law. The bill,
passed in a final reading 399-9 with three abstentions, also would
allow him to suspend governors who face criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma later gave tentative approval to a second bill, which
would allow Putin to fire city mayors who violate federal law.
Lawmakers removed part of the bill that would have allowed
governors to dismiss the mayors, leaving that right only to Putin.
</P>
<P>
   The third part of Putin's plan, passed by the Duma earlier this
month, would revamp the upper house of parliament, or Federation
Council, by removing the governors and heads of local legislatures
from the body and replacing them with appointed legislators. The
bill also would remove regional leaders' immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the governors and regional leaders in the upper
house rejected that bill this week, saying it would give the
president too much power.
</P>
<P>
   All three bills must also be approved by the upper house, unless
the lower house can garner a two-thirds majority of 300 votes to
override an upper-house veto.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin was apparently concerned that confrontation with the
governors could erode his support in the provinces. The strong
criticism of the plan by the governors highlighted cracks in the
widespread backing he has enjoyed since his election in March.
</P>
<P>
   Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov told reporters Friday that Putin
met with him and proposed setting up a committee to work out a
compromise version of the bill on ousting the governors from the
upper house.
</P>
<P>
   Seleznyov said that Putin was ready to consider amending the
bill to allow some regional leaders to keep their Federation
Council seats.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Kharitonov, the head of the Agrarian faction, said Putin
told him in a separate meeting Thursday that he was willing to let
regional leaders keep their seats in the upper house until their
current terms expire.
</P>
<P>
   Putin hasn't spoken publicly on the issue, and the Kremlin press
service had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma voted Friday to propose a joint committee to work out a
compromise version, and gave the Federation Council until Wednesday
to agree to take part.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an act of goodwill on our side, and it's up to them
whether to accept it or not. If they reject it, we will override
the (upper house's) veto,'' said Gennady Raikov, the leader of the
pro-Kremlin People's Deputy group.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton renewed sanctions Friday
intended to punish the ruling Taliban in Afghanistan for refusing
to hand over suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden for trial.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's order kept in force a national emergency declaration
issued last July 4. The order, which must renewed annually, freezes
all property of the Taliban in the United States and prohibits
trade involving the territory of Afghanistan controlled by the
Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban have refused to turn over bin Laden, saying he is a
guest and fellow Muslim. They have, however, assured that bin Laden
has been prohibited from carrying out terrorist activities from
Afghan soil.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban rule almost 90 percent of the country, including its
capital, Kabul. Northern-based opposition forces control the
remainder of the country.

<HEADLINE> Putin Signs Foreign Policy Doctrine  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin approved a foreign policy
doctrine Friday aimed at restoring Russia's global clout and
countering U.S. dominance in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The ITAR-Tass news agency said the paper outlines policies on
national security, defense and cultural ties. It also calls for an
enhanced role for the Foreign Ministry, the report said, without
elaborating.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin press service confirmed that Putin had signed the
document, but gave no details. It said the doctrine was to be
published next week.
</P>
<P>
   The document was apparently part of the national security
doctrine Putin signed earlier this year, which broadens the
Kremlin's authority to use nuclear weapons and accuses the United
States of trying to weaken Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign policy doctrine replaces one adopted in 1993. Russia
was then building political and military partnerships with the
West.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia's attitude to the West has hardened following the
eastward expansion of NATO and the alliance's intervention in
Yugoslavia. Moscow and Washington are also at odds over
Washington's desire to amend the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, China, India and France have all opposed what U.S.
global dominance following the Cold War and have attempted to

<HEADLINE> Whitman cuts $50 million, then signs $21.4 billion budget for new fiscal year </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman on Friday slashed $50
million from the state budget, including a special appropriation
for the one Democratic state senator who voted ''no,'' before
signing the $21.4 billion document into law.
</P>
<P>
   The bill signing came on the final day before the start of the
2000-2001 fiscal year at midnight Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said she imposed the vetoes in order to preserve a
surplus in the budget of $870 million, saying lawmakers had tacked
on too much extra spending that dug into the reserve of cash she
maintained is essential to protect the state's financial credit
rating.
</P>
<P>
   The budget includes many of the governor's hallmark initiatives
for the year, including $45 million for a tax break for some
240,000 low-income working families that will give them a
tax-return check next year even though many of them pay no state
income taxes in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The budget provides for the second-phase increase in a school
tax rebate program that will bring homeowners checks averaging $240
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The largest spending items include $6.7 billion for school aid,
$2.8 billion of it for the so-called ''special needs'' school
districts, mainly urban, poor systems as designated in state
Supreme Court decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The $21.4 billion budget is up 10 percent from the $19.5 billion
budget signed into law one year ago, and up 40 percent from the
$15.3 billion budget Whitman signed in her first year in office in
1994. Over those seven years the overall cost-of-living increased
about 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the outgoing budget for the 1999-2000 fiscal year
that came to an end at midnight Friday was finalized at $20.1
billion, including a last-minute, $208 million appropriation
approved by the Legislature on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   This means the budget signed last June had about $600 million
more pumped into it in supplemental spending proposed by the
Whitman administration and approved by the GOP-controlled
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   If that pattern of past years holds true over the next 12 months
- the last full fiscal year of Whitman's term - the state's budget
will clear $22 billion for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   This extra appropriation on Thursday caused some confusion among
lawmakers who believed they were sending the governor budget
legislation with an $870 million surplus when in fact the
Treasurer's office said it was only $825 million, prompting the
governor's heavy cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in overall spending was cited by the five members
of the Senate and Assembly who opposed the budget on Thursday when
it was up for final votes in the Legislature. It passed 38-1 in the
Senate and 75-4 in the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   One of those opponents, Sen. John Lynch, D-Middlesex, paid for
his ''no'' vote. Whitman used her line-item veto to kill three
special appropriations Lynch had requested totaling $300,000 to
help New Brunswick pay for a shuttle bus, street-lighting and a
housing rehabilitation program.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, the former Democratic minority leader and the last
Democrat to serve as Senate president, has been a caustic critic of
the governor's budget policies throughout her term, chastising her
Thursday for doing too little in times of plenty to reduce the
state's debts.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman in response Friday was remarkably candid in explaining
she cut the funds in retribution for Lynch's vote. Such political
payback has been common in state budget decisions but is rarely
acknowledged so openly.
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't think the budget was good,'' Whitman said. ''He
chose not to support the budget which indicated to me that he
didn't think that those projects were all that important. ... He
voted against his own additions.''
</P>
<P>
   With regard to her overall cuts, Whitman said many of the
lawmakers' local pet projects had to be deleted because they might
set a bad precedent.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, asked about her cut of $120,000 to help Burlington
Township buy new police cars, Whitman said other state agencies had
funding for such purchases and the door would be opened for towns
everywhere to seek this kind of special aid.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is very difficult in flush times to say no,'' Whitman said.
''The precedent that would be set would put a huge strain on next
year and the year after and the year after that.''

<HEADLINE> Egypt Gives US $5M in Crash Aid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Egypt gave the United States $5 million Friday
to help pay for the search and rescue efforts that followed last
year's EgyptAir crash, a congressman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very pleased to receive the $5 million payment and look
forward to soon receiving the balance,'' Rep. John Duncan Jr.,
R-Tenn., chairman of the House Transportation aviation
subcommittee, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt's total bill was $10.6 million, which means that country
still owe about $5.6 million, Duncan spokesman David Balloff said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They would like to see more details, which would be a
breakdown of the 10.6 million,'' Balloff said.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian Ambassador Nahil Fahmy had said in a recent letter to
Congress that Egypt would pay ''$5 million immediately and the
remaining amount ... expeditiously'' to help with the costs of the
U.S.-led investigation of the October crash into the ocean off the
Massachusetts island of Nantucket. All 217 people aboard the plane
were killed, including 101 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt's payment became a more urgent issue in Congress because
the investigating agency -- the National Transportation Safety Board
-- has already spent much of its budget for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB expects the bill for the search and rescue and
investigation that followed the crash to top $20 million, Balloff
said.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB has not reported a cause in the crash. Some aviation
experts have raised the possibility that a co-pilot deliberately
crashed the plane, an idea Egyptian authorities have denied.

<HEADLINE> Proposal could Be Boon for Ethanol  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER LOVEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The corn-based fuel additive ethanol would be
easier and perhaps cheaper to use as an octane-booster in gasoline
under a government proposal announced Friday that has been long
sought by farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, the Environmental Protection Agency has required
that gasoline sold in cities with the most severe summer smog
contain oxygenates to make it burn cleaner. The most popular
octane-booster is MTBE, but ethanol is the oxygenate of choice in
the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   However, the program's pollution-reduction goals were tightened
this year, and that created problems for the use of ethanol in
so-called reformulated gasoline. Because it evaporates more readily
in summer months, it had to be mixed with a specially tailored
gasoline to burn clean enough to qualify for the program.
</P>
<P>
   The cost and difficulty of producing that new blend has been
blamed by some for soaring gas prices in cities like Chicago and
Milwaukee, where most gasoline sold contains ethanol.
</P>
<P>
   The new EPA proposal would give ethanol credit for reducing
carbon monoxide emissions. That newly recognized environmental
benefit of using the alternative fuel could make special blending
unnecessary, meaning reformulated gasoline containing ethanol would
be less costly to produce.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers and Midwestern lawmakers, worried the stricter clean-air
rules would wipe ethanol out of the program, have criticized the
EPA for not moving faster on the proposal. They have been pleading
for action on this issue for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Ethanol is highly subsidized by the federal government, and some
states. Those who blend gasoline with ethanol receive a
5.4-cent-a-gallon federal tax break, and the reformulated gasoline
program is the primary market for the fuel.
</P>
<P>
   But some environmentalists dispute ethanol's environmental
credentials, citing for instance the large amounts of pollution
produced in growing and harvesting corn, its main ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   The agency will take comment on the proposal for two months, and
expects to issue a final regulation by the end of the year, an EPA
official said.
</P>
<P>
   That process will take far too long to have any impact on high
gas prices in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're really talking about next summer,'' said Monte Shaw,
spokesman for the Renewable Fuels Association, a group that lobbies
on behalf of ethanol producers. ''It won't have any effect this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   And ethanol boosters also were disappointed the EPA did not give
ethanol credit for larger reductions in carbon monoxide emissions.
A request for the new regulation from the Illinois EPA suggested a
credit more than three times bigger.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought the science (for the larger credit) was pretty
sound,'' Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   The ethanol industry, led by agribusiness giant Archer Daniels
Midland Co., hopes to significantly increase the fuel's use as MTBE
is phased out because of concerns about it leaking into water
supplies. This rule has been seen as crucial to those efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to give incentive to areas that are using MTBE to use
ethanol,'' said Robert Perciasepe, EPA's assistant administrator
for air and radiation.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Requests Oviedo Extradition  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Paraguay has asked for the extradition
of an ex-army chief who faces murder charges in the 1999
assassination of Parguay's vice president, the Brazilian government
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's foreign and justice ministries said the request for the
extradition of former Paraguayan Gen. Lino Oviedo was received
Thursday night and will be handed over to the Supreme Court on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Oviedo, arrested in Brazil on June 11, is being held in a
federal jail in the Brazilian capital.
</P>
<P>
   The actual extradition proceedings won't begin until August
because the Supreme Court will be in recess during all of July,
Supreme Court spokesman Gerson Matos said.
</P>
<P>
   The high court will hear arguments from both sides and take into
consideration the opinion of the federal attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ''The entire process could take several months, if not years,''
Matos added.
</P>
<P>
   In Paraguay, that country's Deputy Foreign Minister, Julia
Velilla Laconich said the extradition request alleges Oviedo
plotted the March 23, 1999 killing of Vice President Luis Argana.
</P>
<P>
   Oviedo, himself a former presidential candidate, has also been
convicted of leading an unsuccessful coup in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-general was arrested in Foz do Iguacu -- a tourist resort
situated on Paraguay and Argentina's southwest border. Brazilian
police had been searching for him since May 26, when the Supreme
Court, on Paraguay's request, issued a warrant for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Oviedo was sentenced once in Paraguay to a 10-year prison term
for the 1996 coup attempt, but was released after only six months
by then President Raul Cubas.
</P>
<P>
   Oviedo went into exile in Argentina, but vanished on Dec. 9, a
day before the country's new president, Fernando de la Rua, took
office. De la Rua had said he would consider Paraguay's request for
extradition, which his predecessor had rejected.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Anthrax Vaccine Dwindles  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- -- The Pentagon's supply of the troubled
anthrax vaccine is dwindling, and the military faces the
possibility of having to slow the pace at which soldiers get
inoculated.
</P>
<P>
   No decision has been made to suspend the program, Rear Adm.
Craig Quigley, a Pentagon spokesman, said Friday. But he said tight
supplies and the need for stringent testing require ''a decision on
the way ahead for the program in the next couple of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   As of this week, only about 12 percent of the shots needed to
protect all current Pentagon personnel have been administered,
officials said. Just 455,000 of the 2.4 military U.S. military
employees have received at least one of a required six-shot series
to protect against the deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
   Vaccine from a new plant is expected to be ready for use by the
end of the year, Quigley said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, any available vaccine would go first to soldiers
based in Southwest Asia and on the Korean Peninsula, where the risk
of exposure is greatest, Quigley said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The program is pressing on and has been for several months,''
he said. About 4,500 soldiers and other employees are receiving
shots each day, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anthrax is a disease that typically afflicts animals, especially
sheep and cattle. Dry anthrax spores, which can be put into
weapons, can be fatal to humans when inhaled.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon commitment to inoculate all 2.4 million U.S.
military personnel arose from fears that soldiers and others could
be exposed to anthrax attacks by terrorists or hostile forces.
</P>
<P>
   Several House members urged Defense Secretary William Cohen last
month to stop vaccinating military personnel until the Pentagon
finds an improved vaccine, and some soldiers have refused
vaccinations.'
</P>
<P>
   About 700 of those who received shots have filed reports that
they suffered some adverse reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Testing is expected to be completed for a lot of about 200,000
stockpiled doses by mid-July, Quigley said. If it passes, officials
will then have to decide how to administer the vaccine most
effectively. If it fails, they will have to decide how best to use
limited supplies until another lot can make it through the process.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in a vaccine-tight environment,'' Quigley said. ''The
potential is there for the need to restructure the program in the
next couple of weeks, but we're certainly not there today.'' He
said safety of the vaccine will be the top priority in any
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Each lot of vaccine undergoes supplemental testing to make sure
it is safe, sterile and potent, Quigley said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, several anthrax lots failed to meet potency
requirements specified by the Food and Drug Administration. Some
lots have included fewer than 20,000 shots. The lot now being
tested is one of the biggest, Quigley said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're getting to the point on testing where ... we have to be
careful as to how we manage numbers of vaccine left until we get a
new factory on line and can start cranking it out,'' Quigley said.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, he said, the supply is expected to
increase with vaccine from Bioport Corp.'s new manufacturing
facility in Lansing, Mich. Current supplies come only from
stockpiles produced by a small laboratory attached to the
University of Michigan, which manufactured only small quantities of
vaccine each year.
</P>
<P>
   After the Pentagon decided in 1998 to inoculate all 2.4 million
military personnel worldwide, the university sold the license to
Bioport as sole U.S. manufacturer of the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   But the new plant has had difficulties. An FDA inspection in
December cited more than 30 shortcomings that must be resolved
before it is allowed to sell new batches of the vaccine to the
Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley said the plant has been working to meet all
specifications for a new FDA inspection in the fall.

<HEADLINE> Crawford Part of Bulls' Future  </HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- As Tim Floyd was watching Michigan play
basketball on TV one night, he noticed a quick guard with a
distinctive look wearing the Wolverines colors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw this guy running around with a headband and he got my
attention, but I didn't really study him because there were so many
good players on the floor,'' Floyd said.
</P>
<P>
   Now Floyd will get to watch that guard play right in front of
him every day in practice. Jamal Crawford is part of the Chicago
Bulls' future, a 20-year-old whose play in predraft camps
catapulted him into the top 10 of Wednesday night's draft.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was doing an interview with Cleveland and they told me I'd
been traded and I thought they were kidding,'' said Crawford, who
was taken with the No. 8 pick by the Cavaliers and then traded to
the Bulls for the rights to Chris Mihm, selected by Chicago in the
seventh slot.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told them I was going to wear a red suit,'' Crawford said,
reeling off the names of players on the rosters of the Bulls'
championship teams. ''Honestly, that's who I wanted to play for.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford spent nearly as much time on the Michigan bench last
season as he did on the floor. He played in only 17 games because
of two NCAA suspensions, averaging 16.6 points. Then he decided it
was time to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just one of those things we had to go through,''
Crawford's mother Venora said of last season. ''It kept us stronger
and it was something we had to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford's Michigan teammates, in a show of support during one
game as their freshman leader was forced to sit out, all donned
headbands.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford, from Seattle, took the look after seeing an old video
of former SuperSonics guard Slick Watts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I picked up on it and wanted to do something different and now
everybody is doing it,'' Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford has a sense of NBA history, impressing Bulls GM Jerry
Krause by identifying players in old pictures on the wall of
Krause's office.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a picture of Earl Monroe and Wes Unseld and he knew
those guys. And I said, 'Wow, you're a basketball junkie' and sure
enough, he is,'' Krause said.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford, at 6-foot-6, will play point guard for the Bulls but
also can switch to shooting guard. His quickness, passing and
ability to create his own shot caught the Bulls' attention during
the NBA pre-draft camp in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've tried to take bits and pieces of everybody's game,''
Crawford said. ''Earl Monroe had that spin dribble move and I
remember seeing Slick. And being a big guard, big guards are at a
premium right now. The Lakers won a championship with big guards
like Ron Harper and Kobe Bryant. It's just the best time to be
one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls have a young nucleus. Crawford would be just a college
sophomore, fellow 2000 draftee Marcus Fizer a senior and last
year's top two picks Elton Brand and Ron Artest also college
seniors if they had not left early.
</P>
<P>
   Now Chicago, with approximately $20 million of room under the
salary cap, will go hunting for free agents when the negotiating
period begins Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The young players are an attraction,'' Krause said. ''The
veteran free agents know who the young players are, they know the
ones who can play.''

<HEADLINE> Sammy Sosa Trade Winds Die Down  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Sammy Sosa is sleeping better now, and not just
because he's still a member of the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   While the Cubs spent nine hours trying to get from Pittsburgh to
Milwaukee on Thursday night, Sosa was in a Pittsburgh hotel room.
Manager Don Baylor felt the stress caused by weeks of trade rumors
swirling around Sosa had earned the slugger a bit of extra rest.
</P>
<P>
   So while the Cubs sat at a Pennsylvania airport until 5 a.m. EDT
waiting for a mechanical problem to be fixed on their team
airplane, Sosa stayed overnight and joined the team on Friday
afternoon. The Cubs didn't arrive at their hotel in Milwaukee until
well after dawn.
</P>
<P>
   ''He earned a rest. He's had a long three weeks, but I think his
spirits are up now,'' Baylor said shortly after Sosa arrived at
County Stadium on Friday, an hour after most of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees ended their pursuit of Sosa on Thursday
when they acquired David Justice from the Cleveland Indians. But
the Yankees' departure from the trade picture doesn't mean Sosa is
staying in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cubs going nowhere for yet another season, they likely
will continue to try to trade Sosa, whose contract expires in 2001.
But the field of suitors for such an outsized, soon-to-be
high-priced talent as Sosa could be non-existent.
</P>
<P>
   Among the possible suitors for Sosa are Toronto, Cleveland and
the New York Mets, but it would take an extraordinary combination
of players and prospects to make a deal.
</P>
<P>
   At least one observer thinks Sosa will be with Chicago for the
rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a one-market situation,'' first baseman Mark Grace
said. ''There was one team involved, and that team is no longer on
the market, so hopefully we can put this silliness behind us. I
think it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa was changing into his uniform on Friday when Baylor stopped
by for a hug and a humorous chat about the travel problems. Sosa's
minor personality clashes with Baylor this season seem to be the
least of his worries now.
</P>
<P>
   He's still uncertain whether he'll be with the Cubs a month from
now when the trade deadline arrives. He only knows he won't be with
the Yankees, an idea to which he had warmed before the deal
abruptly died.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa didn't speak to reporters before the game, but he was
wearing his famous smile prior to the start of a three-game series
against the Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he's still focused,'' Baylor said. ''You can't get
through the home run race he went through without focus. He knows
how to be a professional.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor acknowledged the trade rumors probably had a negative
effect on his team, which had lost eight of its last 10 before
Friday night. The Cubs had planned a team meeting for Friday to
address the problem, but they held it in Pittsburgh late Thursday
night when they found all kinds of time on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know where those (trade) talks are going to go, but
right now he's on this ballclub and he wants to win,'' Baylor said.
''I think now it's time to finally put this aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's play has suffered since the Cubs, off to yet another
dismal season, began to consider trading their star. He went
5-for-23 over the last week in the middle six games of the Cubs'
12-game road trip, and he struck out in his first at-bat on Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   While Sosa tries to get his stroke back, the Cubs will try to
play through the massive distraction caused by daily Sosa status
updates. Among the topics addressed at the Cubs' team meeting was
the likelihood that Chicago isn't through talking about losing
Sammy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would imagine it would probably resurface,'' Baylor said.
''I don't think we've heard the last of it.''

<HEADLINE> Jury ends second day of deliberations in Quads' Mom trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN ANTONIO (AP) - A jury ended a second day of deliberations
Friday without a verdict in the trial of a South Texas millionaire
accused of arranging the 1997 Florida shooting and stabbing of his
ex-wife, the mother of 2-year-old quadruplets.
</P>
<P>
   The panel got the case on Thursday after three weeks of
testimony in U.S. District Court and deliberated for two hours.
Friday, jurors deliberated for eight more hours before breaking for
the weekend. The jury will return at 9 a.m. CDT on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Blackthorne, 45, is charged with interstate conspiracy to
commit murder-for-hire and with interstate domestic violence. He
faces a mandatory life sentence if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Bellush was killed on Nov. 7, 1997, about two months
after moving with her second husband and six children to Sarasota,
Fla. The quadruplets from her second marriage were discovered
unharmed in the house, two of them crawling in their mother's
blood.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, the jury requested two tapes - one dealing with
Bellush's arrest in September 1997 on a charge of child abuse. The
other is a compilation from various news programs concerning
Blackthorne's ex-wife that prosecutors said he mailed to two
private investigating companies to help track her down.
</P>
<P>
   The jury also requested a newspaper clipping from the San
Antonio Express News detailing Bellush's flight from Texas to
Florida when she moved.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors portrayed Blackthorne as a man who hated his ex-wife
and who, after a string of custody battles, turned his hatred into
a scheme to have her killed.
</P>
<P>
   Using Blackthorne's own words from earlier testimony, prosecutor
Richard Durbin repeated several times, ''He didn't hate Sheila
Bellush. He just hated the things she did.''
</P>
<P>
   In September 1997, Bellush won custody of their youngest
daughter, Daryl, and left the state.
</P>
<P>
   That, Durbin said, led Blackthorne to hunt down his ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
   Bellush and Blackthorne were divorced in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Blackthorne testified Monday that he once became so upset after
a daughter fell out of a second-story window that he told Bellush
he would kill her if ''anything happens to my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackthorne has denied accusations that during a trip to Oregon
he asked Daniel Rocha, a golfing buddy, to find a hit man to kill
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Rocha testified on the first day of the trial that he contacted
a friend, Sammy Gonzales, who hired his cousin, Jose Luis Del Toro,
the alleged gunman.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gonzales and Rocha are serving prison terms in Florida for
solicitation of murder.
</P>
<P>
   Del Toro, 23, a former high school football star in Uvalde, is
scheduled for trial next month in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The victim's second husband and his family are now living in
Sussex County, N.J.

<HEADLINE> Flyers Submit Offer to Lindros  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Flyers submitted an $8.5
million qualifying offer to center Eric Lindros on Friday night,
preventing him from becoming an unrestricted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros, his career in jeopardy because of a series of
concussions, has until Aug. 1 to accept the offer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eric Lindros is one of the top players in the game and is an
integral part of the Flyers organization,'' said Bob Clarke, the
Flyers' president and general manager. ''We are hopeful that he
will enjoy a complete recovery and return to play hockey at the
high level to which we have become accustomed.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarke also made an overture to Lindros personally, noting the
feud between the former captain and management.
</P>
<P>
   ''On a personal level, I greatly regret the extent to which the
relationship between myself and Eric and his family has
deteriorated,'' Clarke said. ''I intend to do whatever I can to try
to move this relationship onto a better course.''
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old center has had six concussions in his NHL
career, the most recent on a check by New Jersey's Scott Stevens in
Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals on May 26.
</P>
<P>
   James Kelly, a concussion expert who has been treating Lindros
said in a report that the injury-plagued star should not play for
now, but can do light exercise, play golf and ride a bike.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros has said he doesn't know when he can return to the ice
and is considering sitting out up to a full year. He even indicated
he might play in Europe where the style of play is less physical.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros has played eight seasons with the Flyers following a
mammoth trade with Quebec that included six players, two
first-round draft choices and $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros has made six All-Star teams and won an MVP award in
1995, but the Flyers lost in their only Stanley Cup final with him.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros' time in Philadelphia has been marked by turmoil and
controversy, including reports that he once left tickets for
reputed Philadelphia mob boss Joseph ''Skinny Joey'' Merlino.
</P>
<P>
   His relationship with Clarke, his childhood hero, deteriorated
to a point this season where the two men didn't speak for months.
</P>
<P>
   The boiling point came after Lindros criticized the team's
medical staff for failing to diagnose his second concussion of the
season on March 4.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke then stripped Lindros of his captaincy, and the star was
ostracized from the team until he returned for Games 6 and 7 of the
Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke had an even bigger problem with Lindros' parents.
</P>
<P>
   He accused Carl and Bonnie Lindros of constantly meddling in the
team's affairs. He said Carl has called him and insisted the team
not trade for certain players for reasons ranging from the player
doesn't pass the puck enough or Eric doesn't like the player's
agent.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want his mom and dad. We've had enough of them,''
Clarke said.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between the Lindros family and the Flyers
really began to sour after Lindros suffered a collapsed lung on
April 1, 1999, in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   The potentially life-threatening injury was diagnosed the
following day, and Lindros and his family had little to no
confidence in the team's medical staff after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lindros said he wanted to remain with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love playing in this city. The fans in this city are
spectacular,'' he said last month in his most recent press
conference with the team.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Auburn Coach Criticizes Pat Dye  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, Ala. (AP) -- Former Auburn coach Terry Bowden, who agreed
not to make derogatory comments about Auburn after resigning in
1998, had unflattering things to say about his predecessor, Pat
Dye, and influential trustee Bobby Lowder.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Auburn Plainsman, Bowden said Dye
should have ''retired and moved on'' rather than remain a figure at
the university. He said Auburn could begin solving its problems by
removing Lowder from the Board of Trustees.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, whose comments were published Thursday by the school
paper, was interviewed June 23 at a football camp in Troy.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden said Friday in a phone interview with The Associated
Press while on vacation in Florida, that he made the published
comments after growing tired of actions taken against him by
Lowder.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bobby Lowder's attorneys have done everything they can on a
monthly basis to remove me from my house, and I just found out that
everything about Terry Bowden's time at Auburn was removed from the
athletics museum. And I'm just getting tired of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really do love Auburn and want to be a part of this
community the rest of my life, but I do wonder when it's all going
to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   A settlement Bowden reached with Auburn when he resigned
included mortgage payments on his home at Auburn if he complied
with other terms of the agreement, such as his comments about the
university and work he might do in the sports world. He has been
doing football commentary for ABC.
</P>
<P>
   In the Plainsman interview, Bowden said: ''Coach Dye is not Bear
Bryant. He was only here 12 years. He never won a national
championship. Pat was a real successful coach, but he wasn't a
difficult act to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He should have retired and moved on, though,'' said Bowden.
''You can't stay around.''
</P>
<P>
   Dye, after resigning in 1992, remained in an administrative role
with the university and was quoted at times about his views of
Auburn football while Bowden was coach.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden said it's disruptive to have a former coach on the scene
talking about his successor.
</P>
<P>
   ''People at Auburn want to love their current coach, so if the
old coach criticizes the new coach, then what are all those people
at Auburn supposed to believe?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lowder, a wealthy Montgomery banker who was instrumental in
hiring both Dye and Bowden, was viewed by some as a
behind-the-scenes force pushing for Bowden's ouster in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''Remove Bobby Lowder from the Board of Trustees is the only way
you're going to fix Auburn,'' Bowden told the Plainsman. ''He
politically understands what he's doing. It's his nature to
micro-manage and control.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Dye's comments might have influenced Lowder to seek
Bowden's ouster, Bowden replied: ''You have to use your own
judgment. Bobby Lowder doesn't know a lick about football. Bobby
Lowder never came to my offices. He didn't have a clue as to
whether I was recruiting good or bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Bobby Lowder is only as good as those who inform him and give
him information,'' said Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, whose Tigers were 1-5 when he resigned in 1998, reached
a $620,000 settlement that among other things bars him from making
negative or derogatory comments ''toward Auburn, the Auburn
athletics department or its employees or the Auburn Board of
Trustees.''
</P>
<P>
   Auburn athletics director David Housel, contacted Friday about
Bowden's published comments, said, ''We're looking ahead, not back.
We're getting ready for the 2000 season.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Lowder said he had no comment at this time.
Attempts to reach Dye were unsuccessful.

<HEADLINE> ACLU Sues Over Convention Access  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A coalition of activists bent on capturing
the attention of Democratic National Convention delegates sued the
city and police department on Friday for greater access to the
August event site.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities plan to have a buffer zone around the Staples Center
and the Los Angeles Convention Center and set up demonstration
areas with a stage and sound system on the opposite side of the
centers' giant parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs claim there is no way delegates would ever see or
hear protesters from that location. Daniel P. Tokaji, of the
American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, said that
violates the protesters' free speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU filed the lawsuit on behalf of a Service Employees
International Union local; a group organizing protesters;
supporters of Mumia Abu-Jamal, who was convicted of killing a
police officer; a National Lawyers Guild chapter; an editor of a
newspaper for the poor and homeless; and a state legislator.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Austin, spokesman for the convention host committee, said
the demonstration area gives activists ''easy access to the
delegates and the residents of Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We put it right square in front of the Staples Center so we
could engage in a dialogue,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> NHL Enters Free-Agent Season  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The NHL's free-agent season opens Saturday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   For players over age 31 like Mark Messier and Claude Lemieux,
unrestricted free agency awaits: no strings attached, sign with any
team that's interested with no compensation required.
</P>
<P>
   For younger stars like Joe Sakic and Jason Arnott, restricted
free agency gives them little leverage. Teams are reluctant to sign
them because the compensation, usually five first-round draft
picks, is stiff.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Flyers submitted an $8.5 million qualifying
offer to center Eric Lindros on Friday night, preventing him from
becoming an unrestricted free agent. Lindros, his career in
jeopardy because of a series of concussions, has until Aug. 1 to
accept the offer.
</P>
<P>
   There probably won't be much activity until next week. GMs will
receive the final list of restricted and unrestricted free agents
Saturday. After that, the cat-and-mouse game begins.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I'll call any agents (Saturday),'' Mike Smith,
manager of hockey operations for the Blackhawks, told the Chicago
Sun-Times. ''I'll wait for them to call us. That's how I do it.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's the rush? If someone wants to sign on Saturday, it's
probably an indication of tampering. If (we lose a player because
we didn't go after him right away), that happens. We're not in a
rush to jump right in.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's formality for NHL clubs was to make qualifying offers
to their respective restricted free agents. Since qualifying offers
usually represent the same salary the player earned the season
before, there often remains much negotiating before training camp.
</P>
<P>
   After teams make a qualifying offer, players then have 30 days
to accept it or become restricted free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Not all restricted free agents will get qualifying offers. Last
summer, the Montreal Canadiens decided not to make one to winger
Jonas Hoglund, who at 26, became an unrestricted free agent and
signed with the Toronto Maple Leafs.
</P>
<P>
   This year it's Alexandre Daigle, who was informed by the Rangers
that he wouldn't get a qualifying offer and thus becomes an
unrestricted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not anticipate being really active,'' Canucks GM Brian
Burke told the Vancouver Sun. ''Now that might change if teams
don't qualify certain guys who would then move from the restricted
list to the unrestricted list.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vancouver Canucks opted to pay the 39-year-old Messier a $2
million buyout for the final two years of his five-year contract
instead of being on the hook for $6 million a season.
</P>
<P>
   Officially the Canucks still hold a faint hope of convincing
their captain to return to Vancouver at a reduced salary.
</P>
<P>
   ''I discussed with Mark what our level of interest is,'' Burke
said Friday. ''He told me he intended to look around.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're sitting tight until July 1 gets here,'' Doug Messier,
Mark's father and agent, said from his South Carolina home on
Friday. ''There's nothing new to report right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux, who turns 35 on July 16, says that while he
''absolutely'' wants to return to the Devils, he'll be testing the
market.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've come this far, so I'll look at all the options,'' Lemieux
told the Bergen (N.J.) Record. ''But, yeah, I'd absolutely want to
come back. It was a great year, and we had a lot of fun. When you
win, there's no better ending to a season.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it has to be the right deal. If it is, that's where I'll
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Other players who are due to become unrestricted free agents
today include forwards Shayne Corson, Gary Roberts, Dallas Drake
and Rick Tocchet; defensemen Vladimir Malakhov, Mathieu Schneider,
Paul Coffey, Dave Manson and Sylvain Cote; and goaltenders Bob
Essensa, Ron Tugnutt, Sean Burke and Tom Barasso.
</P>
<P>
   Corson decided to test the free agent market after mulling over
an offer from his team, the Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's going to go see other teams,'' Montreal GM Rejean Houle
said on Friday. ''We've made him an offer. We'll see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Other restricted free agents include forwards Doug Weight, Owen
Nolan, Slava Kozlov, Brian Savage, Adam Deadmarsh and Mike Peca;
defensemen Sandis Ozolinsh, Scott Niedermayer, Alexei Zhitnik,
Roman Hamrlik, Kenny Jonsson and Sergei Gonchar; and goaltenders
Felix Potvin, Chris Osgood, Steve Shields and Jose Theodore.

<HEADLINE> Navy clears way to tow battleship New Jersey to Camden  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) - The USS New Jersey, which will be converted
into a floating museum, could be turned over to Camden and the
group that will renovate the warship as early as mid-July, Rep. Jim
Saxton said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''At last, the Big J is coming home,'' Saxton said Friday in a
prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   Saxton, R-Mount Holly, who helped lead the Camden campaign, said
Navy officials told him an environmental study about the ship being
permanently docked in Camden had been sent to the federal
Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is a contract between the Navy and the Home Port
Alliance, the group that will run the museum, to turn over the
ship, Saxton said. Then the Navy's most highly decorated warship
will be towed to Camden.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything seems to be falling into place,'' said retired Rear
Adm. Tom Seigenthaler, project director of the Home Port Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   It's likely the ship will be towed to the South Jersey Port off
Beckett Street, Saxton said.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office is expected to complete a review
of the ship docking in Camden in August. But the results of that
study aren't expected to change the outcome, Saxton said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Marge Roukema, R-Ridgewood, in March asked the General
Accounting Office to review the Navy's decision. She had supported
a competing plan to bring the ship to Bayonne, across the harbor
from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Both cities want to host the battleship in hopes that tourists
will flock to a battleship museum.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of commission members favored putting the battleship
at the former Military Ocean Terminal in Bayonne, with the option
of moving it to Liberty State Park in Jersey City if the park's
waterfront were renovated to accommodate the huge vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Navy Secretary Richard Danzig in January announced the
battleship, a decorated veteran of four military conflicts, would
spend its retirement off Camden, just across the Delaware River
from the former Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. The ship was built
there early in World War II.

<HEADLINE> Governor signs bill to repeal hidden gas tax increase before it can take effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman on Friday signed into
law a bill repealing a new but small gasoline tax increase before
it could take effect.
</P>
<P>
   A 1991 law set a special tax of 2.75 percent on the wholesale
price of petroleum products, which resulted in an extra 4-cent tax
on gasoline above and beyond the state's standard 10.5-cent
gasoline tax.
</P>
<P>
   Because the wholesale petroleum tax was based on a rate of 2.75
percent, higher gasoline prices mean a higher tax. With gas prices
now going above $1.50 a gallon, the 1991 law would have driven the
4-cent tax rate higher by tiny increments starting Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   If the gas price were to reach an average of $1.50 a gallon, the
tax would have increased by 1 cent on every 10 gallons of gas. But
should the price reach $2, the tax increase would have reached 1.5
cents per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The bill Whitman signed locked the wholesale tax rate for
gasoline at 4 cents per gallon, no matter what the gas price is.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court expands voting rights for those who choose write-in candidates </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The Supreme Court on Friday ordered
sweeping and possibly costly changes in New Jersey voting
procedures to remove barriers for voters who want to cast their
ballot for a write-in candidate.
</P>
<P>
   It all came about because of a lawsuit brought by three people
who ran for office in the tiny borough of Chesilhurst in November
as write-ins.
</P>
<P>
   Such candidates are rarely given much of a chance of winning,
but in Chesilhurst, where only 411 people voted on Nov. 2, the
write-in votes could have made a difference.
</P>
<P>
   The incumbent mayor, Arland Poindexter, won with 172 votes over
write-in candidate Kati Gray-Sadler with 152 votes. However, at
least two dozen votes for Gray-Sadler had been ruled invalid,
according to the court opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Some votes were invalidated because the voters wrote
Gray-Sadler's name on the wrong line. Others were invalidated
because the voters used stickers with the candidates' names on them
that the voting machines evidently stripped off.
</P>
<P>
   Gray-Sadler and two other candidates who ran for borough council
seats filed a lawsuit after they lost the election complaining they
were denied a fair chance.
</P>
<P>
   A state appeals court dismissed their claim in February, issuing
a half-page opinion saying Poindexter could keep his seat.
</P>
<P>
   But Chief Justice Deborah Poritz landed powerfully on the side
of the little guy on Friday, reversing the appeals court in an
unanimous ruling that ordered Chesilhurst to do it all over in a
special election in August.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Poritz's sweeping decision strengthened the
rights of voters who prefer write-in candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In their legal filings, lawyers for Camden County said the
county elections board might have to spend more than $4 million to
upgrade election machines to make it easier to write in candidates'
names or to affix stickers provided by their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the ruling could require refurbishing or replacement of
voting machines in Monmouth, Essex, Cape May, Passaic, Hudson,
Mercer and Cumberland counties, according to The Philadelphia
Inquirer.
</P>
<P>
   But Poritz ruled that Chesilhurst's voters who wanted to select
a write-in candidate on Nov. 2 faced too many pitfalls, and as a
result ''qualified voters were disenfranchised.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, sample ballots mailed to all voters lacked
instructions on how to write in a candidate's name.
</P>
<P>
   The ballots inside the voting booth had instructions printed in
small type instructing the voter to use the ''personal choice''
lever for a write-in candidate, but the location of that lever was
not marked on the voting machine.
</P>
<P>
   The instructions also told the voter to seek help from
polling-place volunteers if they were confused. The problem is,
once the voter closes the curtain behind them, they cannot reopen
it without automatically casting all of their votes.
</P>
<P>
   And the ballot also had tricky instructions requiring a voter to
hold down a lever with one hand in order to open the small window
in which the voter was then supposed to write the candidate's name
with the other hand.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting her legendary predecessor, former Chief Justice Arthur
T. Vanderbilt, in a 1952 ruling, Poritz said, ''We have held that
it is our duty to construe election laws liberally.'' She said
these laws must be enforced to make sure that every person's vote
counts fully and is not diluted no matter which candidate they
choose.

<HEADLINE> Feds: Wind, Dry Weather Heated Fire  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA ASHTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) -- The wildfire that raced across nearly
half of the Hanford nuclear complex was all but extinguished
Friday, and Energy Secretary Bill Richardson gave assurances that
the flames did not spread radiation.
</P>
<P>
   The 190,000-acre blaze, which was ignited by sparks from an auto
wreck Tuesday and exploded into a 30-mph inferno in less than a
day, was the second fire to sweep a federal nuclear weapons
installation in two months.
</P>
<P>
   Hanford was the chief producer of plutonium for the U.S. nuclear
arsenal for 40 years and is now the storage site for some of the
most lethal wastes on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Richardson declared the fire contained early Friday,
it had burned 45 percent of the 560-square-mile reservation, plus
20 homes in and around the towns of Benton City and West Richland,
just south of Hanford's boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen people were injured, most suffering smoke inhalation.
One man was seriously burned as he tried in vain to save his home.
</P>
<P>
   ''There does not appear to be any contamination whatsoever,''
Richardson said Friday. When asked whether he was absolutely
certain, Richardson replied: ''I never say 'absolutely' any more.
We are satisfied at this time there are no radiation releases.''
</P>
<P>
   David Lochbaum, nuclear safety engineer for the Union of
Concerned Scientists in Cambridge, Mass., said he did not doubt
Richardson's claims. Lochbaum said that early monitoring would have
turned up any ''tremendous concentrations.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire burned across three old radioactive-waste disposal
sites -- a trench and two dried-up ponds. It also burned near some
excavated drums containing uranium wastes but was diverted by
firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   The most lethal waste is in 177 storage tanks buried six feet
underground that could explode if a spark were introduced inside.
Flames got within two miles of the tanks late Thursday, Energy
Department spokeswoman Julie Erickson said.
</P>
<P>
   State tests taken on and off the Hanford complex, and at the
three old disposal sites, all showed no sign of radiation releases,
said Debra McBaugh, a Washington Health Department spokeswoman. The
EPA is also setting up nine monitors around the perimeter of the
nuclear complex.
</P>
<P>
   High wind fanned the flames through dry sagebrush, grass and
scrub trees. About 7,000 people evacuated Wednesday but were
allowed back on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said his agency would start a fire-recovery fund for
those who lost homes and property here.
</P>
<P>
   The agency did the same after the disastrous fire in Los Alamos,
N.M., which destroyed 200 homes and nearly 40 temporary buildings
at the laboratory that built the atomic bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Lessons learned in that blaze helped firefighters here,
Richardson said. Brush was cleared and gravel spread at sensitive
sites. Roads and plowed firebreaks were sprayed with water or flame
retardant.
</P>
<P>
   After the fire, at an inactive research reactor, blackened
wasteland extended right up to the road surrounding the site, and
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Citing other Los Alamos lessons, Richardson added: ''We locked
up all the plutonium.''
</P>
<P>
   Energy Department personnel also said all sensitive documents --
also an issue in New Mexico -- had been locked in fire-safe and
secure areas when the fire became a threat.
</P>
<P>
   Hanford was created during World War II as part of the Manhattan
Project to build the atomic build. It made plutonium for decades,
generating the nation's biggest volume of radioactive waste. Its
primary mission now is cleaning up that waste.

<HEADLINE> Peacekeepers Ambushed in S. Leone  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Gunmen ambushed a U.N.
peacekeeping unit in Sierra Leone Friday, touching off a firefight
that left one Jordanian soldier dead and four others wounded, U.N.
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers were on their way from the western town of
Masiaka to join a convoy of U.N. vehicles at the nearby town of
Mile 91 when they were attacked with guns and a rocket-propelled
grenade, U.N. force commander Maj. Gen. Vijay Kumar Jetley said.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers, all Jordanians, returned fire. Jetley said
said he did not know if the attackers suffered any casualties.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear who had launched the attack, which
occurred about 80 miles east of the capital, Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel Revolutionary United Front signed a peace accord in
July that ended the West African nation's eight-year civil war, but
the insurgents reignited the conflict in early May when they seized
500 U.N. hostages and began advancing toward Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages have since been released, and a ragtag alliance of
pro-government forces has been pushing the rebels away from the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. peacekeepers from Nigeria were moving Friday to reinforce
Mile 91, where about 49,000 people have gathered after fleeing
rebel attacks on surrounding villages, U.N. deputy spokesman Manoel
de Almeida e Silva said in New York. The rebels have been burning
and looting in the area in an apparent search for food.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the peacekeepers came as 21 U.N. troops returned
to Freetown after being held for weeks at an eastern rebel base.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was ''appalled'' by the
attack, Almeida e Silva said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The secretary-general reiterates the United Nations'
commitment to assisting the people of Sierra Leone to achieve
lasting peace in their country,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council, meanwhile, failed on Friday to reach
agreement on a resolution to impose an embargo on diamonds from
Sierra Leone, with members divided over whether to set a time limit
on the ban and to name Liberia as a transit point for the illicit
trade.
</P>
<P>
   The council postponed a vote until Wednesday on the resolution,
which would also strengthen a 1998 arms embargo.
</P>
<P>
   The RUF on Wednesday handed the Indian captives over to Liberian
authorities in the remote border town of Foya. They were then
transported in a government-chartered helicopter to the Liberian
capital, Monrovia, where they were collected Friday by a U.N.
airplane.
</P>
<P>
   All were in ''reasonable health,'' De Almeida e Silva said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 U.N. troops remained surrounded, however, in a
U.N. compound in the rebel stronghold of Kailahun, about 200 miles
east of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   RUF rebels killed tens of thousands of civilians and
systematically maimed many more during the civil war.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Welcomes Anti-Drug Bill  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW SELSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Colombia's defense minister on Friday
applauded Washington's stepped-up role in battling the country's
cocaine and heroin producers who are protected by leftist rebels
and right-wing paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's good news,'' Defense Minister Luis Fernando Ramirez said
of the passage by Congress of a bill earlier Friday that would
provide $1.3 billion, mostly to equip and train Colombian security
forces.
</P>
<P>
   ''They realize ... that the United States must actively link
itself directly to the fight against drug trafficking, like we
expect the rest of the international community will do,'' Ramirez
told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which President Bill Clinton said Friday he would
sign, will provide Colombian security forces with 42 upgraded
Vietnam-era Huey and 18 Blackhawk helicopters. Colombian troops --
trained by the United States -- would use the choppers to seize
control of coca- and poppy-growing areas and allow low-flying
planes to eliminate the crops by fumigation.
</P>
<P>
   Two more special army battalions would be trained by Green
Berets and other U.S. Special Forces under the aid package. One
950-man anti-narcotics battalion has already been trained and is
expected to soon begin helicopter-borne operations from its base in
Tres Esquinas, in southern Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the three battalions, the army will be able to secure the
area where the fumigations will occur,'' Ramirez said.
</P>
<P>
   He called on Western nations to do more by reducing drug
consumption, control the export of so-called precursor chemicals
used in cocaine production, halt black-market arms shipments to
armed groups in Colombia, and to drop trade barriers that impede
access of Colombian goods such as sugar, bananas and textiles to
international markets.
</P>
<P>
   The latter move would induce Colombian farmers stop growing coca
and poppies -- used to make cocaine and heroin respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's main rebel group, meanwhile, hosted foreign diplomats
for the second day in a rebel-held area ceded by the government as
part of a peace initiative.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference in the town of Los Pozos, Manuel ''Sureshot''
Marulanda, chief of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, met
with representatives of 21 countries and spoke of possible prisoner
exchanges, human rights, drug production and distribution, and
other topics, said Simon Trinidad, a rebel spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   However, during the two-day conference which ended Friday, some
diplomats took aim at human rights violations by the rebel group,
known by its Spanish acronym as the FARC.
</P>
<P>
   British Ambassador Jeremy Thorp and Belgian Ambassador Jean Paul
Warnimont asked the FARC to suspend its kidnappings and extorsions
-- which the rebels have used to raise funds -- to stop recruiting
children into its ranks, to stop planting land mines and to halt
attacks on civilian populations, according to press reports from
the site of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Thorp also reportedly asked the rebels to make peace gestures,
such as a cease-fire, and to halt to its well-paid drug-protection
operations.

<HEADLINE> Aircraft subcontractor admits sending substandard parts to assembler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The general manager of a Boeing Co.
subcontractor admitted Friday that he sent substandard metal parts
to a Canadian aviation manufacturer, and then falsified papers
certifying that the parts were up to par.
</P>
<P>
   The parts, called bracket covers, were destined for use on
Boeing 757s but were probably not installed, said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Mark Winston, who is prosecuting the case.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, based in Seattle, could not immediately determine what
happened to the bracket covers, spokeswoman Vicki Ray said.
</P>
<P>
   David Taeschler, the general manager of Tam Metal Products in
Mahwah, pleaded guilty to a single charge of conspiracy to commit
wire fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Taeschler, 39, of Ramsey, faces up to five years in prison and a
$250,000 fine when sentenced Sept. 27 by U.S. District Judge Mary
L. Cooper. The actual penalties would be far less, under federal
sentencing guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Tam got an order for the bracket covers in October 1996 from
Menasco Aerospace, of Oakville, Ontario, which was to use them in
landing gear for the 757s, according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing required that the covers be heat-treated by an authorized
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Tam sent Menasco covers that had not been treated after a
Menasco employee told Taeschler that Menasco would get them treated
in Canada, Taeschler said. He did not name the employee.
</P>
<P>
   The employee later told Taeschler that Menasco could not get the
parts treated in Canada, and that he must send proof of heat
treatment or Menasco could not sell the parts to Boeing, Taeschler
admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Taeschler sent Menasco faxes of fabricated certifications,
falsely showing the work had been done at a Boeing-approved company
in Brooklyn, N.Y., Hercules Heat Treating Corp., he admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Heat treatment is used to harden some metal parts, and to make
others softer. Its use in this application was not immediately
available, Ray said.
</P>
<P>
   Menasco could not be reached for comment because its offices
were closed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is continuing, Winston said.

<HEADLINE> Bucks man makes bail in dancer's death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOUNT HOLLY, N.J. (AP) - A Pennsylvania businessman charged in
Burlington County, N.J., in connection with the March 29 death of
an exotic dancer posted bond Friday after a judge reduced his bail
to $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   John Denofa, 35, of Buckingham, had been in jail on a $1 million
bond, charged with killing 21-year-old Rachel Siani. Siani's
crumpled body was found April 1 under the New Jersey side of a
bridge that connects the New Jersey and Pennsylvania turnpikes.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Superior Court Judge John A. Sweeney agreed Thursday
to reduce Denofa's bond, but ordered him to surrender his passport,
sign an affidavit not to fight extradition to New Jersey, and meet
weekly with a probation officer.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 of Denofa's friends and relatives appeared at the
hearing; some are helping him post bond. Denofa participated in the
hearing from jail by way of closed-circuit television, but did not
make any remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Siani, who lived in Bensalem, had worked at Divas International
Gentleman's Club in Bristol Township. Denofa, who is married, was a
Tuesday night regular and often stayed in the adjoining Econo
Lodge, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Siani was last seen with Denofa at about 2 a.m. March 29 in the
club's parking lot. Police believe that he choked her in a motel
room until she was unconscious, threw her out a window and then put
her in the back of his truck. He then drove to the turnpike, where
she was thrown over the bridge, police charge.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have people who want to believe in something that's really
a fairy tale,'' First Assistant Burlington County Prosecutor
Raymond Milavsky said at Thursday's hearing. ''This is the real
Jack Denofa. ... Anyone who is capable of this is capable of
flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Police have said that blood, hair and fibers consistent with
Siani's clothing were found in Denofa's pickup truck. Prosecutors
have a grainy video of what appears to be a body sprawled in the
bed of the truck as it entered a New Jersey Turnpike toll plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers argued Thursday that three autopsies performed
on the victim's body showed three different causes of death.
</P>
<P>
   Denofa was originally jailed in Bucks County, but was moved to
Burlington County earlier this month after a Bucks County judge
ruled there was sufficient evidence that Siani was killed in New
Jersey. Police believe she died of injuries sustained in the
200-foot fall from the bridge.

<HEADLINE> 'Survivor' Players Cash in Exposure  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Suffering through weeks of roasted rat and
cutthroat competition is beginning to pay for ''Survivor''
contestants: They're making deals for commercials and product
endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Dirk Been, bounced off the island on this week's episode, signed
a contract to appear in ads for an herbal remedy sold by a
California couple. Retired Navy SEAL Rudy Boesch is said to be
making a deal with a knife company.
</P>
<P>
   Some contestants have retained agents to sort through the offers
that have piled up as the show's popularity increased. CBS also has
a say in what the players do because of a contract each signed with
the network.
</P>
<P>
   CBS spokesman Chris Ender said the network is ''setting up a
system to manage these requests in a way that helps the survivors
capitalize on their fame but still protects the 'Survivor' brand.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS is marketing its own ''Survivor''-related products,
including clothing and a board game from Mattel coming in November.
</P>
<P>
   Contestants are voted off Pulau Tiga, Malaysia, by the other
players, with the last person remaining claiming a $1 million
prize. The 13-week adventure, during which rat ended up as part of
the diet, was filmed in the spring.

<HEADLINE> Developer builds hotel over allowed specifications  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) - They probably won't be sleeping on the
street, but the Minnesota delegation to the Republican National
Convention doesn't have a place to stay. The luxury hotel they were
to occupy has not opened because county government officials say
it's too big.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation was going to fill 150 of the 191 rooms at the
six-story Radisson Plaza Suites Hotel, but now has no place to stay
when they arrive in Philadelphia for the GOP convention from July
31 to Aug. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was really looking forward to the Jacuzzis in the rooms. I
heard they had them in the king suites,'' Minnesota delegate
Margaret Cavanaugh said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still want the Minnesota delegation to come to Delaware,''
said J. Harry Feldman, spokesman for the Greater Wilmington
Convention and Visitors Bureau. ''We have some very nice properties
that are only 10 minutes farther away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota GOP said Delaware tourism officials called
Wednesday to say the rooms were in jeopardy. The Republican
National Committee assigned convention groups to their hotels.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this time, we're sort of letting it work itself out,'' GOP
convention spokesman Tim Fitzpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
   New Castle County land use officials say they won't grant the
Radisson an occupancy permit because the finished hotel is bigger
than originally proposed - possibly as much as 39,000 square feet
larger.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, that makes the imposing-looking hotel near
Interstate 95 illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors for New Castle County found numerous inconsistencies
with a building plan filed in 1990. State law prevents any
certificate of occupancy from being awarded to a building that does
not comply with its own filed plan.
</P>
<P>
   The original plans approved a 118,805 square-foot building, but
the developers are now seeking a permit for a 158,176 square-foot
building - 39,371 square feet more than the plans called for.
</P>
<P>
   That new permit is among a dozen requests by the developers,
including Joseph L. Capano Sr. and Albert A. Vietri, to bypass
regulations and make the building legal.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney for Capano and Vietri said the discrepancies
between the steel-and-concrete structure and the plans on paper are
due more to stupidity than dishonesty.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, you probably couldn't count on both hands and feet
how many people blew it on this thing,'' said attorney Larry
Tarabicos.

Lady Birdwood:
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Dowager Lady Birdwood, whose upper-class name gave
her a platform for expounding racist and anti-Semitic views, died
Wednesday. She was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Birdwood was twice convicted of inciting racial hatred, the
first time in 1991 for distributing leaflets calling the Holocaust
a ''Holohoax'' and alleging that Jews had ritually slaughtered
Christian children. She was given a suspended prison sentence in
that case, and again when she was convicted in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, she unsuccessfully sought to initiate an obscenity
prosecution of the nude review ''Oh! Calcutta!''
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, she ran for Parliament on a platform urging compulsory
repatriation of immigrants, and won 69 votes.
</P>
<P>
   The last time she faced prosecution, in 1998, authorities
decided that the onset of Alzheimer's disease made her mentally
incompetent to stand trial.
William Blair:
</P>
<P>
   PETERBOROUGH, N.H. (AP) -- William Blair, a former publisher of
Harper's magazine, died last week. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Blair became publisher in 1968 but left three years later after
clashing with the editor in chief, Willie Morris, over declining
circulation and financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, he moved to a farm in Guilford, Vt., and in 1974,
he and friend Richard Ketchum launched a successful magazine,
Country Journal.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine, which the men sold 10 years later, was aimed at
people who had grown tired of hectic city and suburban life and
taken refuge in rural America.
</P>
<P>
   Blair was born in Glasgow, Scotland, and earned a degree in
economics from Oxford University in the late 1930s. He moved to the
United States in 1940, where he attended graduate school at
Princeton University. He joined the Canadian Army during World War
II.
Germaine Montero:
</P>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Germaine Montero, a celebrated French singer,
actress and poet, died Thursday. She was 90.
</P>
<P>
   She first took to the stage in the theater of Spanish writer
Federico Garcia Lorca, where she played classical Spanish roles and
began writing poetry, which she later expanded on after returning
to France.
</P>
<P>
   In the cinema, she appeared in Rene Clement's ''Mister Ripois,''
1953; Henri Decoin's ''The Iron Mask,'' 1962; Henri Verneuil's
''Songs in the Basement,'' 1963; and more recently in Claude
Lelouch's 1978 release, ''Robert and Robert.''
</P>
<P>
   Montero was a recipient of France's highest award, the Legion of
Honor.

<HEADLINE> Scobee Recalls Chicken Sandwiches  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESQUITE, Texas (AP) -- Scobee Foods Inc. is recalling 12,000
chicken salad sandwiches from stores in seven states because they
may contain an organism that can be fatal to young children and
people with weak immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   The sandwiches were distributed through convenience stores under
the labels 'Scobee Deli Chicken Salad Sandwich' and 'Express Deli
Chicken Salad Sandwich'. The labels on both sandwiches have sell-by
dates of July 14 or July 21.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said the sandwiches are distributed in Texas,
Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   The sandwiches have the potential to be contaminated with
Listeria monocytogenes, which can cause serious infections in
children and frail or elderly people. Although the organism may
cause short-term symptoms in healthy people -- fever, nausea,
headache, stiffness, abdominal pain and diarrhea -- it can cause
stillbirth or miscarriages in pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   The possible contamination was discovered through a routine
sampling program. The company said no illnesses or incidents had
been reported as of Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Scobee said anyone who bought one of the chicken salad
sandwiches can return them for a full refund and said anyone with
questions should call the company at (888) 726-9424.

<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- President Clinton was sued today by an Arkansas
Supreme Court committee seeking to strip him of his law license. It found that
he lacked ''overall fitness'' to be a lawyer. The panel accused Clinton of
serious misdeeds in the Monica Lewinsky affair, including false testimony. ''The
conduct of Mr. Clinton ... was motivated by a desire to protect himself from the
embarrassment of his own conduct,'' the court's Committee on Professional
Conduct wrote. Clinton has 30 days to respond, and his private attorney vowed a

<HEADLINE> Key witness in Gravano case had planned to kill Gravano, witness says </HEADLINE>
By ELISA BONGIOVANNI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) - An Arizona man that was granted full immunity to
testify against Salvatore ''Sammy the Bull'' Gravano had once
plotted to kill the former Mafia underboss, a witness testified in
Maricopa County Superior Court Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Edwin Sr., 44, testified at a bond reduction hearing for
Gravano that he became of aware of key witness Phillip Pascucci's
murder plot against Gravano in December 1997. Edwin said Pascucci
and friend Howard Fishman had a $1 million bounty on Gravano and
had planned to lure him to a poker game and kill him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believed after the second conversation it was real,'' Edwin
said. ''I believed in my heart they were serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano, who was in court Friday to try to reduce his $5 million
bond, is accused of being the brains and bankroller of Arizona's
largest ecstasy syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   Pascucci, who lives in Scottsdale, was arrested June 12 on a
federal drug warrant out of San Antonio, Texas. Pascucci then began
implicating that he had sold large amounts of the drug ecstasy to
Gravano and was recruited by him for a murder plot.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General Donald Conrad says that Pascucci, an
ex-convict, had sold 7,000 ecstasy pills to Gravano from late 1998
through February of this year, when the former hit-man was arrested
in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Conrad claims that Pascucci can describe how
Gravano plotted to kill attorney Ron Kuby who organized a
multi-million dollar lawsuit for families of the 19 people Gravano
murdered as a member of the Gambino crime family in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano admitted killing the 19, but he testified against its
boss, John Gotti, and served just five years in prison. Gotti is
serving a life sentence. When Gravano was released from prison in
1995, he entered the witness protection program, using the name
Jimmy Moran. He dropped out by early 1997. Prior to his arrest, he
had been living in suburban Tempe, near his family.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin further testified that 35-year-old Pascucci had said that
if he ever got into trouble he would just ''roll over on Gravano''
- in other words, turn on him.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad said that Edwin's testimony against Pascucci should be
taken with ''a grain of salt.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It shouldn't surprise you that this was just another murder
plot for Mr. Gravano,'' Conrad said.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano's Attorney Larry Hammond said that Pascucci is not a
credible witness because of his criminal history and the fact that
he didn't implicate Gravano until his third interview with police.
According to court documents, Pascucci was interviewed twice by
Phoenix police detectives four months before his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the bond reduction, Hammond said Gravano is not a
flight risk because he and his family have too much at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything this family does is front page news,'' he said.
''This is a man that should be with his family and have the
opportunity to defend himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Steven Sheldon is not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even assuming the evidence cuts both ways, this man could be
in an Arizona jail until his 60s,'' he said. ''I am not convinced
he wouldn't want to take that alternative (and run).''
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon took the case under advisement and is expected to rule
within five to ten days.

<HEADLINE> Boy Scouts may lose support after winning battle over gays  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID CRARY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The Boy Scouts of America triumphed in their
legal battle over gay scout leaders, but the victory could prove
costly.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the Scouts have squandered a reputation for
tolerance and face an erosion of public support.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're getting left behind where America is going,'' said
Matt Coles, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union.
''People are going to turn to their local governments and say,
'This is a pack of bigots. Don't give them special treatment.'''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that a nationwide movement - ''church by church,
business by business, town by town'' - will gradually cut community
ties with the Scouts and edge them into the ranks of ideological,
right-wing groups.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's Supreme Court ruling - allowing the Scouts to retain
membership and leadership criteria that exclude avowed homosexuals
- resulted from more than a decade of litigation. The Scouts never
wavered during the dispute, insisting on the right to set their own
standards in pursuit of character-building.
</P>
<P>
   ''Scouting's record of inclusion is impressive by any
standard,'' the Scouts declared after the high court ruling.
''However, we do ask all our of members to do their best to live
the Scout Oath and Law,'' which include pledges to revere God and
be ''morally straight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Scouts' policies have cost them financial support from
several corporations, including jeans maker Levi Strauss &AMP; Co.
Seven of the 1,400 United Way agencies nationwide have halted
contributions, and several local governments have severed ties. The
Scouts were removed from a list of charities that Connecticut state
employees could support through payroll deductions.
</P>
<P>
   However, Scouts spokesman Gregg Shields said the organization's
funding has been stable, with new contributors offsetting the
losses. He said Scout membership has risen 7 percent in the past
three years to 6.2 million - ''the kind of growth we've not seen
since the baby boom era.''
</P>
<P>
   ''For the past 20 years, we've made no secret of our policies,''
Shields said. ''We respect the right of all other Americans to hold
different values than ours, and we ask to be granted the same
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   About 60 percent of Scout units are sponsored by churches. Among
the three most active denominations in sponsoring Scout troops, the
Mormon and Roman Catholic churches backed the Scouts in the
gay-leaders dispute. The social policy board of the United
Methodist Church, which sponsors more than 420,000 scouts,
condemned the policy on gays as discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   Another religious organization, the Unitarian Universalist
Association, has assailed the Scouts on two grounds: its stance
toward homosexuals and its resistance to accommodating atheists or
agnostics.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many of us look to the Scouts to serve the function of civic
education,'' said the Unitarian Universalists' president, the Rev.
John Buehrens. ''That's the basis of their congressional charter
and their access to public facilities. But if they are a now
private organization with a homophobic standard, I believe those
things ought to be called into question.''
</P>
<P>
   Buehrens said he had fond memories of attending a Scout jamboree
as a youth.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was one of my first experiences with the glorious diversity
of humankind,'' he said. ''Now, for the Scouts to turn their back
on an entire class of people, it's shameful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Scouts' sympathizers believe the organization will emerge as
strong as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any money that has been lost has been more than made up by
private supporters who are thrilled to see at least one major
organization upholding what they see as traditional moral
standards,'' said Patrick Reilly of the Capital Research Center in
Washington. The center promotes charitable giving to conservative
and pro-business causes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Scouts get a lot of support from Christian churches, and
clearly that will continue,'' Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted any attempt to demonize the Boy Scouts would
backfire: ''To characterize the Scouts as far right is tantamount
to categorizing apple pie as anathema to America. The Scouts are as
American as you get.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet critics note that other major national youth organizations,
including the Girl Scouts, have opened their ranks to homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU's Coles said the Scouts risk suffering a fate similar
to that of the Daughters of the American Revolution, which lost
stature and public support decades ago as it became identified with
racial bias and conservative politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Scouts have allied themselves with an extreme minority
view that is out of sync with America,'' Coles said. ''They can
either abandon this policy in a couple of years or they can slowly
dissolve into obscurity.''

<HEADLINE> Mexican-American Voting Difficult  </HEADLINE>
By MEGAN K. STACK
<TEXT>
<P>
   MATAMOROS, Mexico (AP) -- When Mexico chooses a president on
Sunday, millions of U.S. residents will be eligible to cast a
ballot. Few will be able to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Voting outside Mexico is still banned, despite a six-year effort
to reach out to compatriots in the United States. That means the 7
million Mexican adults living on U.S. soil -- about one-tenth of all
eligible voters -- will have to cross into Mexico to vote, and there
are only 64 special booths set up along the border to handle all of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know what to expect,'' said Berenice Rendon-Talavera,
Mexico's consul in Brownsville, Texas. ''Right now, it's unclear
how many people will come. That question has never been so big
before.''
</P>
<P>
   In the six years since Mexico voted President Ernesto Zedillo
into office, the country appeared to reach out to compatriots in
the United States with the offer of dual nationality and a promise
-- still unfulfilled -- of absentee voting abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Money Mexicans living in the United States wire back to
relatives at home makes up Mexico's third-greatest source of legal
income, topped only by oil and tourism. But the obstacles facing
those Mexican U.S. residents who wish to vote are formidable.
</P>
<P>
   The few border voting booths available to them already will be
clogged with migrant factory workers living in northern Mexico's
industrial cities.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, ballots will be hard to come by: Each polling
center is limited to 750 paper ballots. A legacy of suspicion and
fraud, the tight limit on absentee ballots is meant to prevent
multiple or fraudulent voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still feel like it's my duty -- my duty to vote,'' said
Apolonio Rojas, a Houston carpet layer. ''But even if I could go,
they wouldn't have a ballot for me when I got there. That's their
trick.''
</P>
<P>
   The big border city of Tijuana has only 11,250 ballots available
for all absentee voters. In Ciudad Juarez there will be only 2,250.
Each industrial center has more than 1 million people, and both are
magnets for migration from the Mexican interior.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, opposition supporters said they were organizing
thousands of Mexicans to cross the border and camp out in Tijuana
on election night. They suspect the ruling party will try to crowd
booths with their own supporters to exhaust the ballots -- and they
plan to be there first.
</P>
<P>
   ''The elections could have been organized here in Los Angeles
without any problems,'' said Felipe Aguirre, an activist for a
leftist Mexican party. ''It just appears the (ruling party) wants
to hold onto power at any cost.''
</P>
<P>
   For illegal residents, casting a vote means risking arrest by
border agents. And with Mexican-American households fanning far
into the northern United States, the journey to Mexico will be too
long and expensive for many.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are too many impediments,'' the Houston immigrant and
community organizer Cristobal Hinojosa said. ''Voters here, even
the ones who are very interested, won't be able to make the trip.''
</P>
<P>
   If federal voting registration cards were misplaced during a
hectic or illicit move across the border, forget it: no card, no
vote. Mexico's electoral institute estimates 1.5 million voting
cards still are carried by U.S. residents.
</P>
<P>
   A government proposal to allow absentee voting in the United
States died in the Mexican Senate last year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in 1998, Mexico revised its constitution to accept
Mexican ''nationality'' of those who also take U.S. citizenship -- a
measure that reached out to Mexican-Americans even if it did not
affect voting rights.
</P>
<P>
   Some immigrants are ignoring the obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   From Chicago and Austin, Texas, eye-catching caravans are
winding their way south. One group from Yakima, Wash., set out on
horseback before loading the animals onto trailers for the drive to
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Other voting will be quieter: Border families can easily slip
into Mexico, cast their vote without fanfare and get home in time
for Sunday dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ''People see there is a possibility of making a change in
Mexico,'' said Felipe Aguirre, a California union organizer who
will join a group of voters headed south to the Mexican polls.
''People are really mad at the government.''
</P>
<P>
   After 71 years of unbroken rule by one party, many immigrants
blame the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, for the bleak
economic straits that forced them to seek their fortunes on foreign
soil.
</P>
<P>
   In the polls, National Action Party candidate Vicente Fox is
running about even with the PRI's Francisco Labastida. The ruling
party has probably never come so close to losing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an anger, a very personal type of vengeance,'' said Jose
Hinojosa, professor of political science at the University of
Texas-Pan American, just across the border from Reynosa, Mexico.
''To want to get back at the PRI because you've had to leave your
hometown.''

<HEADLINE> Twins 7, Indians 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Matt Lawton hit two home runs and the Minnesota
Twins sent the Cleveland Indians to their third straight loss, 7-2
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Midre Cummings, who also homered, Corey Koskie and Lawton each
had three of the Twins' 16 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ledee, in his Cleveland debut after being acquired from
the New York Yankees in a trade for David Justice on Thursday
night, started in left field and went 1-for-3 with a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton hit a two-run homer in the first inning off Jim Brower
(2-2). Lawton led off the sixth with his sixth home run, connecting
off Brian Williams for a 7-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Redman (5-3) won for the first time since May 30. He
allowed one run on four hits in five innings, snapping his
three-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Redman had gone 0-3 with a 7.03 earned run average in five
previous starts in June.
</P>
<P>
   LaTroy Hawkins gave up one run in four innings for his third
save.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings led off the Twins' fifth with his third homer. Koskie
and Chad Moeller had RBI singles later in the inning to give
Minnesota a 6-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Two Cleveland errors on one play gave the Twins a 3-1 lead in
the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   David Ortiz opened with a single and Moeller then lined a single
to right, which Alex Ramirez misplayed. Ortiz scored and Moeller
went all the way to third when second baseman Robbie Alomar's relay
throw skipped past catcher Sandy Alomar.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez led off the ninth with his fourth homer for Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Minnesota has 33 homers in its last 33 games. ... It was
Lawton's third career two-homer game and first since Sept. 19,
1997. ... Koskie went 3-for-5 and has hit .385 (35-for-91) in his
last 28 games. ... Cleveland's Charles Nagy, in his third
rehabilitation start, pitched six scoreless innings for Double-A
Akron, allowing one hit and striking out eight. He had right elbow
surgery May 19. ... Sean DePaula followed Nagy with one hitless
inning in his rehab outing. He went on the disabled list May 29
with tendinitis in his right elbow.

<HEADLINE> Ricky Ledee Set To Help Indians  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Ricky Ledee says he is over the shock of being
traded.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was sad when it happened, but I see this as an opportunity
and I am ready,'' Ledee said Friday after taking batting practice
for the first time as a member of the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee, 26, was dealt to Cleveland by the New York Yankees for
outfielder David Justice on Thursday night. The Indians have until
Aug. 1 to select two minor-league prospects from a list provided by
the Yankees to complete the trade.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee, wearing No. 22, was in the starting lineup against the
Minnesota Twins as the left fielder, batting seventh. He went
1-for-3 with a walk in a 7-2 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard rumors of a trade and the last place I thought it
would be was Cleveland,'' Ledee said. ''I was surprised, but then I
thought about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm coming to a team with a lot of talent, a team that has
been a consistent winner and wants to keep winning. It's a good
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Still, I wasn't prepared for it. I spent 11 years in the
Yankees organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade left the Indians clubhouse a bit confused.
</P>
<P>
   ''It kind of shocked everybody,'' pitcher Dave Burba said. ''The
general consensus is that there is more going on.
</P>
<P>
   ''To take the RBI leader out of your lineup, there has to be
more to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice, 34, had 58 RBIs in 68 games with 21 home runs and a
.265 average. Ledee batted. .241 with seven homers and 31 RBIs in
62 games with New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ricky has a definite upside,'' Indians manager Charlie Manuel
said. ''I'm going to put him in the lineup against all pitching and
see what he can do. I remember him getting some big hits off our
lefties last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the field, I want to see him play center and might even put
him over in right field, too. I understand he can play all of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Manuel again dismissed suggestions that the deal meant
Cleveland, 8&AMP;frac12; games behind the first-place Chicago White Sox, were
giving up on a chance of winning a sixth consecutive AL Central
title.
</P>
<P>
   ''Looking at where we are and where we want to be, this deal is
definitely a positive,'' Manuel said. ''We still need a few more
things, a starting pitcher, some help in the bullpen and maybe
another hitter, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like the way Ricky swings the bat. I think he can help us
get there.''

<HEADLINE> Champlain border improvements discussed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHAMPLAIN, N.Y. (AP) - Reacting to fatal crashes and
consistently snarled traffic, officials have laid out options to
improve the Champlain crossing between the U.S. and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   It will be summer of 2003 before the $23 million improvement
plan can begin at the Champlain border facility, the U.S. General
Services Administration said Thursday. In a briefing at the border,
GSA staff outlined four alternative designs for revamping the
facility.
</P>
<P>
   Long waits to pass through Customs and dangerously congested
traffic were seen as a hindrance to growing trade with Canada and
economic growth in the corridor between Montreal and the
Champlain/Hudson Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers said all options include expansion of
passenger-vehicle lanes, additional truck lanes, more parking,
expansion of the main building, reconfiguration and improvements to
the bus-processing area, a building for inspection of animals and
plants, a separate Immigration and Naturalization Services
inspection area and consolidation of broker/cargo services.
</P>
<P>
   Interim improvements include signs as far as eight miles out on
the Canadian side warning of possible congestion.
</P>
<P>
   The interim plan also includes rumble strips and message boards
to warn of congestion.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the cost, the major changes must be approved by
Congress, a move that is not likely until fall 2002. A contract
could be awarded in October or November of that year.

<HEADLINE> 100 Countries Approve War Tribunal  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- More than 100 countries approved two
documents for world's first permanent war crimes tribunal Friday --
a move the United States said was a step toward exempting Americans
from prosecution by the court.
</P>
<P>
   But with the United States clearly in mind, many countries
warned that they will oppose any changes to the 1998 Rome treaty
creating the International Criminal Court -- and any interpretation
of its rules that makes a dispensation for one country.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Rome statute is here to stay and it cannot and will not be
changed,'' declared Philippe Kirsch, chairman of the commission
preparing for the court's operation, just before closing the
three-week meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The strong statements from countries ranging from the European
Union to New Zealand and Angola set the stage for tough
negotiations at the commission's next meeting starting in November,
when the United States is hoping to win final agreement for an
exemption.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. effort ''to undermine the court'' has failed at this
session, said Richard Dicker, associate counsel for Human Rights
Watch. ''But governments will have to prepare for another assault
in November.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief U.S. negotiator David Scheffer, the ambassador-at-large
for war crimes issues, denied that the United States was trying to
change the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just very satisfied with the outcome of this,'' he said,
referring to the approval of the documents. ''It is a long journey.
We've taken another step and we'll take some more steps as the
months go by.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States was one of seven countries voting ''no'' when
120 countries meeting in Rome approved the treaty to establish the
tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   What the United States objects to is that American citizens can
be subject to the court's jurisdiction if an alleged crime is
committed in a country that has ratified the treaty -- even if the
United States is not a party. Washington says this would leave U.S.
troops and citizens vulnerable to politically motivated
prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the U.S. stand on the treaty, it has been a key player
in 18 months of negotiations that culminated Friday with agreement
on the two documents: on rules of procedure for the court; and on
elements that constitute crimes against humanity, war crimes and
genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Scheffer likened the first document, the elements of crime, to a
checklist that will be used to determine whether a person has
committed such crimes as sexual slavery and torture.
</P>
<P>
   The rules of procedure cover a wide spectrum, but the United
States focused particularly on one rule dealing with conditions
under which the court may request the surrender of a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S. view, Scheffer said, the rule agreed on Friday does
not prevent the court from entering a separate international
agreement with a country on the surrender of suspects.
</P>
<P>
   This is ''the gateway,'' he said, for a proposal the United
States expects to make at the commission's next meeting to exempt
Americans from prosecution as long as the United States has not
ratified the treaty. The U.S. proposal will also address concerns
of the European Union and other nations that an exemption for the
United States could not be used by ''irresponsible nations,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what we're negotiating right now, but that's for
November-December,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Tar Heels Coach Guthridge Retires  </HEADLINE>
By ELIZABETH A. DAVIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- Bill Guthridge hopes his successor as
coach will have ''Carolina connections,'' and Roy Williams has
already agreed to discuss rejoining one of the nation's most
storied college basketball programs.
</P>
<P>
   Guthridge retired Friday, just three seasons after following
Dean Smith, the winningest college basketball coach of all time.
Williams, who had been an assistant to Smith before taking over at
Kansas in 1988, appears to be the No. 1 candidate for the job.
</P>
<P>
   He denied an Associated Press report that he had already agreed
to take over the Tar Heel job. A source familiar with the
university and speaking on condition of anonymity told the AP that
Williams would be the next coach.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has agreed to talk to UNC athletic director Dick
Baddour, but said it is ''completely false'' that he has accepted
the job. Asked if he had been formally offered the job, he said,
''No.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically I've just told them that I would talk to them, and
that's it,'' Williams said at a news conference in Lawrence, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's that line, don't let the facts get in the way of a good
story?'' he said. ''For somebody to say something else, that's
fabricated. ... There's no source on this, there's no source. It's
Roy Williams and nobody else.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he expected ''that in the next 24-to-48 hours there'll
be a definite plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Somebody asked me, 'Can you say no to Dean Smith?' It would be
hard. But it would be harder to say no to my players,'' he said.
''I feel I owe it to myself and my family, their program and coach
Smith. I owe it to talk to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas athletic director Bob Frederick believed ''we have
certainly a good chance to keep Coach Williams at University of
Kansas. I don't want to put any odds on it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that he's really struggling with this decision, so
based on that, I think we have a great chance,'' Frederick said.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina officials skirted questions about the vacancy,
not wanting to turn the spotlight away from Guthridge, who took
over when Smith retired in 1997 after 36 years as coach.
</P>
<P>
   Even Williams said: ''This was a day that I hoped would never
come, to be honest with you. As late as 2:30 yesterday I was still
trying to talk Coach Guthridge out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old Guthridge said he lacked the energy for a fourth
season and began considering retirement last month when he returned
from a European vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I could get my batteries recharged, and it came time
for a decision to be made. I think it is time to turn it over to
someone else,'' Guthridge said at a news conference with Smith and
Baddour by his side.
</P>
<P>
   Guthridge wouldn't elaborate after saying he hoped the next
coach would have ''Carolina connections.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Tar Heel and Detroit Piston Eric Montross attended the
news conference and said, ''My gut is it will be someone in the
Carolina family.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith wrote in his memoir, ''A Coach's Life,'' that before he
retired in 1997, he told recruits: ''If I'm not coaching, I am
confident that your coach will be either Bill Guthridge, Eddie
Fogler, Roy Williams, Larry Brown, George Karl or Phil Ford, not
necessarily in that order. It has to be one of those.''
</P>
<P>
   Guthridge laughed and joked several times during his press
conference. The emotion of telling his players goodbye came the
night before.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'd kinda get a couple of words out and then get choked up,''
said assistant coach Pat Sullivan, a former player from 1990-95.
</P>
<P>
   Guthridge then handed each player a statement about his
retirement because, ''I couldn't read it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I was shocked,'' said Jason Capel, a returning junior
forward/guard. ''It was very tough hearing it, and now it's
finalized. It makes it harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Guthridge spent 30 seasons as an assistant to Smith, and took
the Tar Heels to the Final Four in two of his three seasons as head
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ''What a marvelous run of three years,'' Smith said. ''I don't
think it will ever be duplicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Guthridge said a few weeks ago he planned to stay another five
or six years despite intense criticism from fans and alumni after
the team's worst regular-season record (18-13) in decades. During
the season, the Tar Heels fell from the Top 25 for the first time
in a decade. But North Carolina rebounded in the NCAA tournament,
earning a berth in the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Last season marked the 14th time Guthridge participated in the
Final Four. He competed in one as a player at Kansas State in 1958
and was an assistant coach at 11.
</P>
<P>
   Guthridge coached UNC to the Final Four in his first season
before losing to Utah. He set NCAA records for most wins by a
first-year head coach with 34, and for wins in his first two years
with 58. In his second year, UNC lost to Weber State in the first
round of the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into what would have been the fourth year of a five-year
contract, Guthridge compiled an 80-28 record, but had not received
an extension.

<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Vladimir Guerrero's error allowed the go-ahead
run to score in the ninth inning as the Florida Marlins stopped a
three-game losing streak with a 5-4 victory over the Montreal Expos
on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   With the game tied 4-4 after Guerrero scored the tying run in
the eighth, pinch-hitter Kevin Millar singled off reliever Steve
Kline (1-2) to lead off the ninth for Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Castillo, 3-for-5, hit into a force at second before Mark
Kotsay singled to right and the ball got past Guerrero as he
charged the ball. Guerrero's sixth error of the season allowed
Castillo to score his third run of the game and gave Florida a 5-4
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Almanza (1-0) got one out in the eighth for the win.
Antonio Alfonseca pitched the ninth for his 23rd save in 26
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos fell to 4-6 on their 12-game homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 4-2, Montreal scored two in the eighth on Chris
Widger's two-run infield single.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Vidro doubled to lead off the eighth to extend his hitting
streak to a career-best 13 games and chase Florida starter Chuck
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Braden Looper struck out White and got Guerrero to hit
a grounder to third baseman Mike Lowell, who bobbled the ball as
Guerrero beat out the throw.
</P>
<P>
   White and Guerrero advanced on Looper's wild pitch and Stevens
walked to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Widger followed with a chopper just out of the reach of Looper
and reached safely ahead of shortstop Andy Fox's throw to first, as
White scored from third.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero, who never broke stride as he rounded third, raced home
and slid in safely just ahead of first baseman Derek Lee's relay
home to score the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo hit a leadoff single off Javier Vazquez, who got the
next two outs before Preston Wilson connected for his 17th homer to
give the Marlins a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos tied it 2-2 in the third on Rondell White's two-run
single.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo singled to lead off the fifth, stole second and scored
the go-ahead run on Kotsay's RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a 30-year-old right-hander acquired June 9 from Texas'
Triple-A affiliate in a three-way trade involving the Rangers and
the Chicago Cubs, scattered five hits in seven-plus innings. He
struck out five and walked two before leaving after allowing
Vidro's leadoff double in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez, who allowed nine hits and three runs in seven innings,
ended the month with a 1-3 record in six June starts.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's Andy Fox hit his second homer of the season off
reliever Anthony Telford with two outs in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Kotsay, 2-for-5, is hitting .514 (19-for-37) with nine RBIs
in his last nine games. ... Just 8,047 attended the game. ...
Chicago received OF Brant Brown and Texas got 1B-OF Dave Martinez
in the three-way trade. ... Marlins SS Alex Gonzalez missed his
fourth straight start due to an injured right middle finger. ...
Cliff Floyd went 0-for-5 to finish June 29-for-99 (.293) with six
doubles, six homers and 21 RBIs. He also stole six bases and scored
18 runs in the month. ... Expos closer Ugueth Urbina will have his
injured right elbow examined by orthopedic specialist Dr. James
Andrews next weeks after another bone chip was found in the elbow
Thursday. Urbina, who had a bone chip surgically removed from the
elbow on May 17, will travel with the team to Atlanta on Sunday
following its series finale with Florida. ... The Expos are 26-17
at Olympic Stadium.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Albert Belle and Harold Baines had two RBIs
apiece in a six-run third inning, and Pat Rapp earned his first win
in a month as the Baltimore Orioles ended a 13-game losing streak
against Toronto with an 8-3 victory Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Will Clark homered and Delino DeShields drove in two runs for
the Orioles, who have won three of four after a nine-game skid. It
was Baltimore's first win against the Blue Jays since April 10,
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp (5-5) allowed two runs and six hits in seven innings,
walking one and striking out three. He was 0-3 with an 8.22 ERA in
five starts since May 29.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's Carlos Delgado went 0-for-4, ending his 22-game
hitting streak. Tony Batista hit his 21st homer for the Blue Jays,
but Delgado went 0-for-4.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Halladay (3-5) yielded seven runs, four hits and four walks
in 2 2-3 innings, his shortest stint as a starter this season.
Coming in, he was 2-0 with a 0.00 ERA in 15 innings lifetime
against Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Clark put the Orioles ahead 1-0 in the second with his third
homer, a 420-foot shot to center on a 3-1 pitch.

   Baltimore sent 11 men to the plate in the third and went up 7-0.
After DeShields singled in a run and Belle hit a two-run double,
Halladay was pulled after issuing two straight two-out walks. Lance
Painter then gave up a two-run single to Baines and allowed another
run to score on a wild pitch.

<HEADLINE> Ala. Principal Hikes for Students  </HEADLINE>
By GARRY MITCHELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONROEVILLE, Ala. (AP) -- A principal who helped save a tiny
Alabama school battled fatigue and blistered feet Friday as she
finished a 54-mile, 18-hour trek along Alabama back roads to
celebrate her students' academic turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Robinson left Monroe Senior High School in remote
Packers Bend on Thursday night, accompanied by 40 supporters,
including parents and students, and headed for the county seat of
Monroeville.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lord Jesus, I thought I was going to stop. The hill at Perdue
Hill nearly killed me,'' Robinson said before noon Friday, stopping
at a store to treat a blister. ''I'm afraid of rats and snakes, and
when it was dark, it was mighty scary.''
</P>
<P>
   But she made it back to Monroeville on Friday afternoon, less
than 17 hours after departing, and proclaimed: ''I'm feeling
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Monroe has only 108 students in kindergarten through 12th grade
-- a dramatic drop from the more the 500 it had in the 1980s -- and
its high school is the smallest in the state with 54 students.
</P>
<P>
   When Robinson, a 40-year-old fifth-grade teacher, was made
principal in 1997, the school was filthy, morale was low, test
scores were abysmal and the Monroe County school board threatened
to close it.
</P>
<P>
   But at Robinson's urging, students at the 70-year-old, all-black
school studied through longer school days and on frequent
Saturdays, and their test scores -- and pride in their school --
began to rise.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the school's eight seniors all graduated, and four
have earned college scholarships. The school is now a showplace,
Monroe School Superintendent Dennis Mixon said.
</P>
<P>
   The final victory came when the school was removed from academic
caution and given clear status by the state Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   ''To say black kids can't do it because of poverty is wrong,''
Robinson said. ''You can't get any poorer than here. Kids can do it
if someone believes in them.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is to let my students know that in life there are going
to be some hard roads and in order for you to achieve these goals
you have to continue to work at it.''

<HEADLINE> S.C. Pulls Plug on Most Video Poker  </HEADLINE>
By DAN LEWERENZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Fourteen years after video gambling became
legal in South Carolina, the plug was being pulled on nearly all
the machines because of a statewide ban that was to take effect at
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Huddled in dark, smoky rooms Friday, players' reaction on video
gambling's final day was mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bored. That's what I'm going to be -- bored,'' said Wanda Rose,
playing at the Double Diamond in Columbia. ''I mean, it's my money.
I think that I should be able to spend it however I want.''
</P>
<P>
   A man who owns five casinos in South Carolina won a temporary
injunction from a Circuit Court judge allowing him -- and only him --
to keep his video poker machines running for 10 days, until a
hearing on his challenge to the ban.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Charlie Condon said he told state and local law
enforcement officers to obey the order ''if it appears valid'' but
sought to have it overturned late Friday by the state Supreme
Court, which had already denied other requests for emergency
injunctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just one poker baron asking this judge to stop the
enforcement of a valid state order,'' Condon said. ''This raises a
very serious question of judicial accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   Video poker became legal in South Carolina after a lawmaker
slipped a provision into a bill; it eventually became a $3 billion
annual industry.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-gambling forces fought hard to outlaw the machines, a
battle that came to a head in 1998 when then-Gov. David Beasley, a
Republican, called video gambling ''a cancer on South Carolina''
and vowed to get rid of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Video gambling operators responded by pouring money into the
campaign of Democrat Jim Hodges, who won the governor's race with a
promise to call for a referendum on video gambling's future.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature last year approved the referendum as part of a
bill that also banned video gambling unless voters decided to keep
the machines. Last October, the state Supreme Court threw out the
referendum, but kept the part of the law banning video gambling on
July 1.
</P>
<P>
   State officials planned to check machines early Saturday to make
sure they are turned off. Operators have one week to get the
machines out of the state or destroy them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad it's out,'' Margaret Perry said Friday as she played
at D J's Video Games in Columbia. ''It's caused a lot of problems
in my life. It's been a detriment to my spiritual life. I hate
myself for this, for what I've done.''

<HEADLINE> Mets 11, Braves 8  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Shea Stadium rocked Friday night, and John
Rocker had nothing to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza capped a 10-run, eighth-inning comeback with a
tiebreaking, three-run homer off Terry Mulholland, and the New York
Mets stunned the Atlanta Braves 11-8 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, the controversial reliever who has become New York's No.
1 villain, remained in the bullpen as Kevin Millwood handed an 8-1
lead to Atlanta's bullpen, only to watch Don Wengert, Kerry
Ligtenberg and Mulholland (8-7) fritter it away, forcing in three
runs with bases-loaded walks.
</P>
<P>
   A sellout crowd of 52,831 filled Shea Stadium on Fireworks
Night, but the sparks were created by the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The threatened ''Battery Night'' demonstration against Rocker
went dead -- he even spent some time during batting practice signing
autographs for the very fans he disparaged last year.
</P>
<P>
   While fans chanted, ''We want Rocker!'' they should have been
happy he didn't come in. On Thursday night, he pitched a perfect
eighth in the Braves' 6-4 win.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 runs matched the most ever scored in an inning by the
Mets, and nine were driven in with two outs. The comeback from a
seven-run deficit was the second-largest in club history.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves finished June at 13-15, their first losing month
since September 1996. Third baseman Chipper Jones missed the game
to return to Atlanta, where doctors were to induce labor in his
wife, Sharon.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell led off the eighth with a single off Wengert, and
Piazza hit an infield single with one out.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Ventura's RBI grounder off Wengert drove in Bell, who set
a Mets record by scoring for the 10th straight game.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Zeile hit an RBI single and, two batters later, Ligtenberg
forced in two runs by walking pinch-hitter Mark Johnson and Melvin
Mora with the bases loaded. Mulholland relieved for the first time
since May 16 and walked Bell, making it 8-6.
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Alfonzo followed with a two-run single that tied it, and
Piazza hit the next pitch for his 22nd homer, extending his streak
of games with RBIs to 13.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Cammack (1-0) got his first major league victory. Armando
Benitez pitched the ninth for his 19th save.
</P>
<P>
   Until the eighth, the Braves appeared on their way to a
methodical win.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood allowed one run and six hits in seven innings, and
Brian Jordan boosted the lead to 8-1 with a three-run homer off
Cammack in the top of the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Mets starter Mike Hampton walked six (one was intentional),
threw two wild pitches and hit a batter.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta went ahead in the first when Hampton walked Javy Lopez
on a 3-2 pitch with the bases loaded, then added three in the third
on Lopez's two-run single and an error by Piazza, who allowed Benny
Agbayani's throw from left to get away. Andres Galarraga, who began
the play on first, came home from third on the error.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Lockhart had an RBI grounder in the seventh, a ball that
would have been an inning-ending double play if not for a bad relay
throw to first by shortstop Mora.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Matt Franco hit a two-out, RBI single in the
seventh that made it 5-1.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Mets also scored 10 runs in the sixth inning against
Cincinnati on June 12, 1979. ... The Mets' biggest comeback was
from an eight-run deficit at Houston on Sept. 2, 1972. ... Piazza
went 0-for-3 against Millwood, dropping to 2-for-19 (.105) against
him in his career. ... Piazza had gone 51 games since April 14
without an error. ... It was the first sellout at Shea since the
home opener. ... Greg Maddux, scratched from his scheduled Thursday
start because he was feeling ill, was scheduled to pitch Saturday
against Al Leiter.

100 Countries Approve War Tribunal
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- More than 100 countries approved two documents for the
world's first permanent war crimes tribunal today -- a move the United States
said was a step toward exempting Americans from prosecution by the court. But
with the United States clearly in mind, many countries warned that they will
oppose any changes to the 1998 Rome treaty creating the International Criminal
Court -- and any interpretation of its rules that makes a dispensation for one
country.

fitness'' to be a lawyer. The committee's lawsuit accused the president of
engaging in serious misconduct in the Monica Lewinsky affair, including false
testimony, that ''damages the legal profession.'' The five-page lawsuit asks
that Clinton be disbarred for conducting ''himself in a manner that violates the
model rules of professional conduct as adopted by the Arkansas Supreme Court.''
The president has 30 days to respond, and his private attorney vowed a vigorous
fight.

running in the primary because he had no intention of actually competing for the

Perot didn't want to put his name on the Reform ballot only to stop Buchanan.

the FBI will now step in and try to retrieve the missing e-mails. Congress, Ray

<HEADLINE> Kansas' Williams Fate Not Decided  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG TUCKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) -- Roy Williams is pleading for patience as
two of the nation's premier basketball programs and their fans
await word from the winningest coach of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Should he stay at his beloved Kansas or return to his beloved
North Carolina?
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina coach Bill Guthridge retired Friday, just three
seasons after following Dean Smith, the winningest college
basketball coach of all time. Williams, who had been an assistant
to Smith before taking over at Kansas in 1988, appears to be the
No. 1 candidate for the job.
</P>
<P>
   He denied an Associated Press report that he had already agreed
to take over the Tar Heels' job. A source familiar with the
university and speaking on condition of anonymity told the AP that
Williams would be the next coach.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people in North Carolina don't really know what I have
here,'' Williams told a packed news conference on the Kansas campus
Friday evening. ''The people here don't realize what I'd have in
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing I'm saying is give me a little patience. Give
me a couple of hours, give me a couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   As he headed for a vacation at his beachfront home in South
Carolina, Williams promised a decision no later than July 7, the
day before the summer recruiting period begins. He added that there
could be ''a definite plan'' in the next 24 to 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   A native of North Carolina and a 10-year Smith assistant,
Williams said he has had 23 firm offers from NBA and major college
programs since taking the Kansas job in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ''With only one exception, every one of those situations have
been handled with one phone call,'' he said. ''I have shown my love
and loyalty for Kansas.''
</P>
<P>
   Few coaches in any sport enjoy such love and loyalty from fans.
During Williams' tenure, he has made a tradition of buying
doughnuts every morning before home games and passing them out to
students who camped out all night for tickets.
</P>
<P>
   When he walked out of Allen Fieldhouse following the news
conference, about 200 people, mostly students, greeted him with
cheers and applause and banners urging him to stay.
</P>
<P>
   One large banner read, ''Please don't go.'' Another said, ''We
love you Roy.''
</P>
<P>
   As he waded into the crowd signing autographs and shaking hands,
a little girl handed him a rose. Taking it from her hand, he picked
up the child and hugged her, wiping tears from his eyes as the
people cheered.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes earlier, Williams said all he had agreed to do was
to talk about the job with North Carolina officials. He denied any
formal offer had even been made.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's not a lot else I can tell you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas athletic director Bob Frederick, who came under heat for
hiring an obscure assistant coach 12 years ago, sat at the table
next to Williams and sounded optimistic about keeping him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Based on the conversations we had this morning, I think we
have a good chance of keeping coach Williams,'' Frederick said. ''I
know he's really struggling with this decision.''
</P>
<P>
   A protege of Smith, Williams admitted it would be difficult to
tell his old boss no.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it would be harder telling my players no,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One player, senior forward Kenny Gregory, said earlier that he
had dismissed reports Williams had decided to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it was a done deal, coach would have enough respect to talk
to the players first. He always said he would,'' Gregory said.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas Chancellor Robert Hemenway said the school was privileged
to have Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our hope and fervent desire is that the best basketball coach
in America will continue to practice his craft at KU,'' he said
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' North Carolina ties have remained strong. Both his son
and daughter went to school there. His wife is from North Carolina
and her family is still there.
</P>
<P>
   ''My family is not 100 percent on what direction I should go,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who turns 50 on Aug. 1, is 329-82 in 12 seasons at
Kansas since leaving Smith's Tar Heel staff. He took the Jayhawks
to the Final Four in 1991 and 1993 and led Kansas to a 286-60
record in the '90s, the best of any NCAA Division I school. Before
him, no college coach had reached 300 victories before 12 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In the past nine years, Williams' teams have claimed seven
conference championships.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a day I hoped would never come,'' Williams said. ''I'm
very happy here.''

<HEADLINE> Tigers 3, Royals 1  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Jeff Weaver took his shutout bid into
the ninth inning, leading the Detroit Tigers to a 3-1 victory over
the Kansas City Royals on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   After allowing only four hits over eight innings, Weaver (5-6)
gave up consecutive singles to Johnny Damon and pinch-hitter Mark
Quinn in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver walked none and struck out four.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Jones relieved and gave up an RBI single to Mike Sweeney,
but got three outs for his league-leading 21st save in 22
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Fick's three-run homer in the third inning was all the
offense needed for Detroit, which managed only five hits.
</P>
<P>
   After Dan Reichert (3-5) walked Deivi Cruz and hit Luis Polonia,
Fick homered deep into the right-field bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Reichert gave up three hits and three runs in six innings,
walking two and striking out five. Besides hitting Polonia, he also
threw two wild pitches.
</P>
<P>
   His second wild pitch moved Bobby Higginson to third after his
leadoff double in the sixth, but Higginson was caught in a rundown
after Juan Gonzalez failed on a squeeze play.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney went 3-for-4 and had two of Kansas City's six hits
against Weaver. He doubled in the seventh inning and was thrown out
trying to stretch a single into a double in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Royals shortstop Rey Sanchez played his 53rd straight errorless
game, a club record. Greg Gagne set the previous mark in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Weaver is 4-1 in his last five decisions and has not lost
since June 14, an 8-1 defeat by Toronto. ... The Tigers' Juan
Encarnacion went 0-for-3, breaking an eight-game hitting streak.
... The Royals announced the resignation Friday of Terry Wetzel,
their senior director of scouting. Wetzel and new general manager
Allard Baird both cited philosophical differences but declined to
be more specific.

<HEADLINE> Rochester officer charged with rape  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A Rochester police officer has been
charged with threatening and raping a 21-year-old woman.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Lee Gainey, 41, was arrested Thursday in Irondequoit
following an investigation that started June 23, Irondequoit Police
Chief Richard Boyan told the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Gainey, a 10-year-veteran, had been on the job until the day he
was arrested. He was arraigned and jailed in lieu of $10,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   The Rochester Police Department suspended Gainey with pay,
pending the results of an internal affairs investigation and the
criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Boyan said Gainey is accused of raping a 21-year-old woman June
3 in Irondequoit, a suburb of Rochester. The woman did not tell
police about the rape until June 23.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe County District Attorney Howard Relin said Gainey had a
relationship with the woman and said, ''this was not one incident.
It was over a long period of time.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Frank Thomas and Brook Fordyce each hit two home
runs Friday night as the Chicago White Sox powered past the Boston
Red Sox 10-4.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas hit a solo homer in the fifth inning off Bryce Florie and
added another solo drive, his 22nd, an inning later off Rheal
Cormier.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas now has 12 homers in June, tying his personal best for
one month. He also has three multi-homer games in the last nine
days.
</P>
<P>
   Fordyce hit a solo shot in the fifth and a two-run shot in the
eighth, giving him three for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Lee also homered for Chicago, which improved its lead
over Cleveland in the AL Central to 9&AMP;frac12; games.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Parque (8-2) won his fifth straight decision in span of
seven starts, allowing eight hits and three runs -- one earned -- in
5 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, its lineup and rotation ravaged by injuries, including
one to ace Pedro Martinez, got homers from rookie Izzy Alcantara
and Scott Hatteberg. The Red Sox lost for the eighth time in 11
games.
</P>
<P>
   Hipolito Pichardo (2-1), who missed the entire 1999 season after
having reconstructive surgery on his right elbow, made his first
start since Aug. 20, 1998, when he was with Kansas City, and lasted
only four innings. He gave up six hits and four runs.
</P>
<P>
   Fordyce's single, a double by Jose Valentin and an intentional
walk to Thomas loaded the bases in the third. Magglio Ordonez drove
in a run with a grounder before Chris Singleton hit a two-run
double into the left-field corner.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez left the game in the top of the sixth after pulling up
lame while running on a double in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Fordyce's second homer made it 4-0 in the bottom of the fourth,
before Boston broke through for three against Parque in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Alcantara led off with his first major league home and, after
Parque retired the next two hitters, Valentin misplayed Jason
Varitek's grounder for an error. Nomar Garciaparra singled and Carl
Everett was hit by a pitch to load the bases before Morgan Burkhart
delivered a two-run single to make it 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' homer off Florie, a liner just over the left-field
fence, gave the White Sox a 5-3 lead in the fifth. After Ordonez
doubled and moved to third on an infield out, Lee hit his 15th
homer to finish Florie after one-third of an inning.
Notes: The error was Valentin's 18th of the season. ... The Red
Sox have allowed a homer in 15 straight games, a club record. ...
Thomas also hit 12 homers in May 1994. He now has 18 career
multi-homer games. ... The five homers tied a season high for the
White Sox.

<HEADLINE> Report Finds Flaws Causing Gas Leak  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- High-ranking officials were not
immediately notified and alarms were ignored during a tiny leak of
dangerous nerve gas at the Army's chemical-weapons incinerator in
May, according to a report by the plant's operators.
</P>
<P>
   The report from Army contractor EG&AMP;G Defense Materials Inc.
blamed the leak in Tooele, Utah, on a chain of events that began
when debris jammed the feed chute of a rocket kiln.
</P>
<P>
   The report said an inexperienced operator flushed the kiln with
too much air, pushing unburned nerve gas out an emissions stack.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said a supervisor was preoccupied with
administrative work, higher officials were uninformed about the
leak and warnings were ignored because of a history of false
alarms.
</P>
<P>
   The state and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
have said the leak -- the size of a drop -- wasn't dangerous, but the
plant remains shut down for investigation.
</P>
<P>
   EG&AMP;G's general manager, Michael J. Rowe, said much of the plant
-- except for the problem furnace -- should be running again by
mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   The Tooele incinerator helps the government comply with a 1985
law that requires the destruction of deadly chemical agents --
including nerve gas, mustard gas and VX gas -- once part of the
military arsenal.

<HEADLINE> Car Jumps, Kills Toddler and Woman  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER ANDES
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A car jumped a curb and careened onto a
sidewalk near the National Zoo on Friday, killing a toddler in a
stroller and a woman and injuring two other people, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   The crash occurred on a busy commercial street lined with shops
and restaurants two blocks from the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, Bernard Gregory Antoine, 39, of the District of
Columbia, was arrested and charged with vehicular homicide, said
Captain Michael Jacobs, a police spokesman. Police ruled out
alcohol as a factor in the accident, citing instead excessive speed
and driver inattention.
</P>
<P>
   District resident Graham Johnston said he heard crushing metal
and honking and ran to the scene. He said the driver appeared in
shock, asked repeatedly about the toddler and muttered something
about losing control of the car.
</P>
<P>
   One-year-old D'Montrall Morris was pronounced dead at the scene
and an unidentified woman with severe leg injuries was pronounced
dead at a hospital. The boy's cousin, Threshon Morris, 18, and a
woman identified as Elizabeth McKenzie, 74, were listed in good
condition at another hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Police closed Calvert Street, a main commuter artery, throughout
the evening rush hour, creating backups for miles.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Rafael Palmeiro and Royce Clayton
homered, leading Kenny Rogers and the Texas Rangers over the
Seattle Mariners 13-3 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro had three hits, including his 382nd homer. His solo
homer in the fifth inning moved him into a tie for 39th on the
career list with Frank Howard and Jim Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Royce Clayton drove in three runs to help the Rangers win for
the fourth time in five games. Chad Curtis, Mike Lamb and Rusty
Greer all drove in two runs for Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Greer hit a two-run double in a seven-run seventh that broke
open the game. Seattle lost for the second time in 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers (8-5) won his fifth consecutive decision, allowing three
runs and seven hits in seven innings. He struck out six and walked
two.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers took a 2-0 lead in the first off John Halama (7-4)
on Palmeiro's RBI double and Curtis' run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton's 13th homer in the second inning made it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle tied it at 3 in the fourth on Edgar Martinez's
run-scoring double and Jay Buhner's two-run homer
</P>
<P>
   But Texas chased Halama in the fourth, taking a 5-3 advantage on
RBI singles by Lamb and Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Palmeiro's 21st homer off Rob Ramsey extended
Texas' edge to 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Texas scored seven times in the seventh. Curtis, Gabe Kapler,
Lamb, Clayton and Luis Alicea had consecutive RBI singles.
Notes: Rangers pitcher Darren Oliver has been cleared to test his
ailing left shoulder by throwing off a mound on Saturday. He is on
the 15-day disabled list due to weakness in the shoulder. ... At
19-8, the Mariners had their second-best June in team history.
Seattle had a 20-7 June in 1997. ... Texas has had three seven-run
innings this season. ... The Rangers turned four double plays.

<P>
   SALLISAW, Okla. (AP) -- A congressional candidate who had planned
to give away guns as prizes at a campaign fund-raiser Friday
decided instead to call off the banquet.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Detro, who is seeking the Republican nomination for the
House seat being vacated by GOP Rep. Tom Coburn, said the Oklahoma
Republican Party had recommended several times that he abandon the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office had also said the plan was
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The banquet that was to have been Friday will be rescheduled
later. Detro said it wasn't likely to have anything to do with guns
-- other than his campaign's emphasis on the freedom to bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Second Amendment is still a big issue with my campaign,
but I didn't want to alienate myself from the Republican Party,''
he said. ''I didn't want to put myself in that predicament.''

<HEADLINE> Mets 'Die-Hards' Fail to Start  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Mets' die-hards didn't turn out for
John Rocker Battery Night.
</P>
<P>
   And the fans who did come didn't get to see New York's most
hated man, who cracked under pressure -- the thumb of his pitching
hand, that is.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really let the team down,'' Rocker said after the Mets
rallied from a seven-run deficit, scoring 10 times in the eighth
inning for an 11-8 victory Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker threw one warmup pitch in the bullpen in the seventh
inning, and a callous on the thumb of his left hand started
bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   ''Situations like tonight,'' Rocker said, ''are the times that I
pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, fliers had been distributed outside Shea Stadium,
calling for fans to gather behind the right-field fence before
Friday night's game, where they would be given batteries to throw
at the controversial reliever.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no gathering out by the entrance to the No. 7
train, which Rocker did not take for the second straight day,
instead preferring a police-escorted black van. The only evidence
of any protest was a 40ish man selling T-shirts that read ''Battery
Day Shea 2000/John Rocker .../Beat the Braves.''
</P>
<P>
   The heavy police presence -- 700 officers -- was evident for the
second straight night. At the Thursday's opener of the four-game
series, there were no incidents, although police arrested two
people -- one for disorderly conduct, another for entering a
''players only'' zone -- and issued 63 summonses for open containers
of beer, police spokesman Sgt. Victor Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, there were three arrests for disorderly conduct and
one for assualt, plus seven for scalping and 26 for vending without
a license. In addition, there were 246 summonses issued for alcohol
use, according to New York police department Det. Robert Samuel.
None of the arrests were Rocker related, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fans did get to boo Thursday as Rocker ran to the mound and
pitched a perfect eighth inning in Atlanta's 6-4 win.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Thursday, there was much less fan and media
interest during batting practice Friday night, which was a sellout,
partly because postgame fireworks were on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, whose xenophobic comments to a reporter in December
caused baseball to suspend him for the first two months of the
season, arrived at Shea Stadium about 2&AMP;frac12; hours before game time but
wouldn't talk with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nah, I've got stuff to do,'' he said when asked if he would
discuss Thursday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Standing out shagging flies in left field, he signed a few
autographs for fans in the bleachers, then ran for warmups.
</P>
<P>
   He went into the left-field corner and four policemen
coordinated as fans in the loge and mezzanine tossed balls and
gloves down onto the field for the reliever to sign. Rocker signed
about 50 autographs for 10-15 minutes. At first, he threw the balls
and gloves back to the fans. Later, he handed the objects to
police, who tossed them back.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone hates you, but they want you to sign something.
They're all a bunch of sellouts,'' 22-year-old Joe Giammarino said
just before throwing a T-shirt to the field to get autographed.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest pregame boos went to former-Met Bobby Bonilla, who
started at third base for the first time this year. Chipper Jones,
Atlanta's regular third baseman, returned home when doctors decided
to induce labor in his wife, Sharon.

<HEADLINE> Some Ready to Forgive Rocker  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE WATSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Maybe it was John Rocker's contrition, or maybe
the heavy police presence surrounding him, but some New Yorkers
seem ready to forgive their major league menace.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's an excellent pitcher. He's just got the wrong attitude,''
said 12-year-old Josh Chaplain, of Great Neck, N.Y., as he awaited
the first pitch between the Mets and Braves at Shea Stadium on
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he just cleans up his act and apologizes and not come back
and say something else, New York will forgive him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, who pitched an inning Thursday night against the Mets,
could only watch as the Mets rallied for 10 runs in the eighth
inning for an 11-8 win in the second game of the series.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves reliever broke open a callous on his pitching
thumb while warming up and was unable to work.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas LaRocca, 79, of Bayonne, N.J., echoed the thoughts of
many of the 52,831 fans when he said the only thing better would
have been if Rocker had been pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have liked to have seen him come in and get the
loss,'' LaRocca added. ''I hate the guy because he has a big
mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Rocker emerged from a door behind left field
and headed toward the stands to sign a few baseballs.
</P>
<P>
   As he came closer, eager fans tossed baseballs, T-shirts and at
least one glove for him to sign. The barrage prompted Rocker to
walk away, surrounded by police.
</P>
<P>
   And even then, nobody blamed him.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was trying to be cordial, but he was getting bombarded and
so he walked off,'' said Seth Ott, one of the fans nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Samradli, speaking with his 9-year-old son Jonathan
looking on, said he didn't really wish Rocker any harm.
</P>
<P>
   ''He apologized yesterday and people in New York are better than
him, so they'll forgive him,'' Samradli said.
</P>
<P>
   And Anthony Brown, 27, of Jersey City, N.J., simply compared
Rocker to the Indiana Pacers' talkative star, Reggie Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't hate the guy,'' he said. ''He's a professional.''

<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire set a record for career home runs
at Busch Stadium as the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Houston Astros
5-4 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, 1-for-16 with eight strikeouts entering the game, hit
his major league-leading 29th home run in the fifth to cut the
Astros' lead to 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire homered off starter Chris Holt (3-9) for the third time
in 12 at-bats to give him 551 career home runs, including 104 at
Busch Stadium. McGwire, who broke Ray Lankford's mark, has played
215 games at Busch Stadium since being traded to the Cardinals in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Holt gave up five runs on 11 hits, struck out four and walked
three in 5 1-3 innings to fall to 1-6 on the road this season.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Benes (2-1) pitched two scoreless innings to get the win,
and Dave Veres threw two scoreless innings for his 15th save.
</P>
<P>
   After McGwire homered in the fifth to get the Cardinals within
4-3, St. Louis scored twice in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Renteria hit an RBI single, and Jim Edmonds drove in the
go-ahead run with a sacrifice fly after the Cardinals loaded the
bases.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros scored two unearned runs in the fourth with some help
from Cardinals starter Rick Ankiel.
</P>
<P>
   After a leadoff single by Chris Truby, Holt walked after failing
to lay down a bunt. Truby and Holt advanced on Julio Lugo's
sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Biggio grounded to third and Truby scored during a rundown
when Ankiel dropped the ball. Holt scored on Jeff Bagwell's
sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Ankiel gave up four runs on six hits with three walks and five
strikeouts in four innings.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Drew scored the Cardinals' first run in the first on a
sacrifice fly by Lankford after Drew and Edmonds singled and
McGwire walked loaded the bases.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals scored a run in the fourth when Fernando Tatis,
activated Friday after being out since April 29 with a torn groin,
led off with a single and scored two outs later on a single by
Ankiel to make it 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Houston scored in the fourth on an RBI single by Truby after a
one-out single by Moises Alou and a walk to Lance Berkman.
</P>
<P>
   Truby drove in the Astros' first run in the second with a single
after Alou led off with a single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Houston has lost nine of its last 11, while the Cardinals
have won eight of their last 11. ... Bill Spiers, who has a
nine-game hitting streak, has not played since reaggravating a
strained left hamstring June 25. ... Alou is 11-for-18 (.611) on
the road trip. ... Larry Sutton, sent to Triple-A Memphis when the
Cardinals activated Tatis, had reached base in his last three
pinch-hit appearances. Tatis received a standing ovation when he
batted for the first time. ... Ankiel had two hits Friday to snap a
1-for-18 slump. ... The crowd of 46,262 was the fourth-straight
sellout and the 10th in 40 home games. ... Renteria has 10 hits in
his last 19 at-bats.

Ark. Court Sues To Disbar Clinton
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- President Clinton was sued Friday by an Arkansas
Supreme Court committee seeking to strip him of his law license. The committee's
lawsuit accused the president of engaging in serious misconduct in the Monica
Lewinsky affair, including false testimony, that ''damages the legal
profession.'' The five-page lawsuit asks that Clinton be disbarred for
conducting ''himself in a manner that violates the model rules of professional

100 Countries Approve War Tribunal
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Two documents were approved by more than 100 countries
for the world's first permanent war crimes tribunal Friday -- a move the United
States said was a step toward exempting Americans from prosecution by the court.
But with the United States clearly in mind, many countries warned that they will
oppose any changes to the 1998 Rome treaty creating the International Criminal
Court -- and any interpretation of its rules that makes a dispensation for one
country.

   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- At least eight people were crushed to death and
three others were injured Friday when fans rushed the stage during a Pearl Jam
concert at one of Europe's largest rock festivals. Members of Pearl Jam had
urged the crowd to move back because people were being pressed up against the
stage, and the warning was repeated on loudspeakers, Danish radio said. The band
halted its performance and the following session by The Cure was canceled. But
concerts on six other stages went on, a festival spokesman said.

Perot Shuns Bid for President

   DALLAS (AP) -- Two-time presidential candidate Ross Perot Friday turned down
backer' efforts to put his name on the Reform Party's primary ballot, removing a
potential hurdle for Pat Buchanan's bid. The Texas billionaire decided against
running in the primary because he had no intention of actually competing for the
White House in November, Russell Verney, Perot's spokesman, said. Verney said
Perot didn't want to put his name on the Reform ballot only to stop Buchanan.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House has yet to recover any missing e-mails
sought by investigators, a judge disclosed Friday, but it is turning over backup
tapes that might contain the messages to Independent Counsel Robert Ray and the
Justice Department. Two law enforcement officials told The Associated Press that
the FBI will now step in and try to retrieve the missing e-mails. Congress, Ray
and Justice are investigating whether the e-mail problem was an innocent
mistake, as the White House contends, or part of an effort to obstruct their
investigations.
