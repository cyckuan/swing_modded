<HEADLINE> More Small SUVs Headed to Showrooms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Playing catchup in a market niche dominated by  
Honda and Toyota, more automakers introduced several compact, 
car-based sport utility vehicles Tuesday aimed more at styling 
about town than off-road exploring. 
</P>
<P>
	Lincoln-Mercury unveiled the unconventional ``my,'' a five-door,  
bulbous concept car the Ford Motor Co. division touts as a 
``go-anywhere, do-anything'' vehicle that further blurs the 
distinction between a car and SUV. 
</P>
<P>
	As the latest automaker to join the SUV fray, Hyundai Motor Co.  
pulled the wraps off its Santa Fe, a concept car the Korean 
automaker bills as the ``big little SUV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The renewed interest in station wagons as SUV/minivan wannabes  
also was evident at Tuesday's media preview of the North American 
International Auto Show. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp.'s Saab unit ended its roughly 40-year  
absence from the station wagon sector with its 9-5, which the 
automaker plans to market as a sporty alternative to bigger 
minivans or SUVs. 
</P>
<P>
	Subaru, the Japanese automaker that re-established itself in the  
United States by marketing wagons and cars as ``hybrid utility 
vehicles'' with all-wheel-drive and SUV-like cladding, unveiled the 
redesigned Outback wagon and sedan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford wouldn't speculate when the ``my'' could reach showrooms,  
saying that would depend on reaction to its features, such as rear 
doors that open toward the back and four bucket seats -- the rear 
two able to fold down for an expanded cargo area. 
</P>
<P>
	A mouse-like ball controls instrumentation of the vehicle, which  
has a six-cylinder engine and all-wheel drive. It also has a global 
positioning system, and even a roof of amber glass and similarly 
tinted windows, which Ford describes as built-in sunglasses for the 
occupants. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's something that sets this vehicle apart,'' said J  
Mays, Ford's design chief. ``It gives passengers in 'my' an 
open-air feeling without being exposed to the elements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai plans to turn the Santa Fe into a production model that  
will reach U.S. showrooms in late spring 2000 as a compact SUV with 
four- or six-cylinder engines and two- or all-wheel drive. It bears 
style cues from the Tiburon coupe and Sonata sedan, and shares many 
of the Sonata's major parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai expects the Santa Fe to compete with Honda's popular  
CR-V and Toyota's RAV4 and be priced under $20,000 fully equipped. 
Hyundai anticipates selling 20,000 to 25,000 Santa Fes next year, 
targeting buyers ages 18 to 34. 
</P>
<P>
	Swedish automaker Saab expects to begin production of its 9-5  
wagon in May. It was displayed with two mountain bikes strapped to 
its luggage rack. 
</P>
<P>
	The wedge-shaped wagon features a turbocharged engine and an  
illuminated cargo area with a foldable shelf and slide-out floor. 
Saab expects the 9-5 to fetch $35,000 to $40,000 for each of the 
4,000 vehicles the company expects to sell in its first year in 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a cargo standpoint, it offers more than an SUV or  
minivan,'' said Joel Manby, SAAB Cars USA Inc.'s president, adding 
the target consumer could include ``housewives who want to get out 
of that minivan image.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other unveilings Tuesday included:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The Lexus I.S., a small sports sedan it plans to begin selling  
here in summer 2000. The North American version of the I.S. -- it 
will have a different name when it goes on sale here -- will differ 
little from the version already on sale in Japan and Europe. It 
will have a V6 powering the rear wheels, and compete with the BMW 
3-series and Audi A4 sport sedans. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Mazda's concept version of its next-generation minivan that it  
plans to produce later this year. The redesigned MPV is about the 
same size as the old version that Mazda stopped selling last year, 
but Mazda says it's designed to be lighter and more nimble than its 
predecessor and competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The MPV will come with a 170-horsepower V6 and seating for  
eight. The rear seats fold into the floorboard and can be flipped 
over 90 degrees for tailgating. Prices were not announced.

<HEADLINE> Report: Couch To Enter NFL Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Tim Couch is reportedly ready to turn pro,  
giving up his senior year as Kentucky's star quarterback for the 
riches of the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN reported Couch has contacted NFL offices to request a faxed  
copy of the paperwork he must file by Friday to declare his 
eligibility for the league's draft and was in the process of 
selecting an agent. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion Cleveland Browns hold the No. 1 pick in the draft  
and are reportedly considering taking Couch, who is coveted by NFL 
scouts for his 6-foot-5, 225-pound size, accuracy, touch and 
experience in Kentucky's pro-style passing offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch's mother, Janice, said from the family's home in the  
Appalachian town of Hyden that an announcement about her son's 
plans was scheduled for Thursday. She said Couch and his father, 
Elbert, were not available. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she didn't know what decision her son has made.  
</P>
<P>
	In Cleveland, Browns president Carmen Policy did not immediately  
return a telephone message seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Policy has said in the past that the Browns would be likely to  
take a franchise quarterback with the top pick, but Browns scouts 
are reportedly also taking a close look at Texas running back Ricky 
Williams, college football's leading career rusher and this year's 
Heisman Trophy winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch threw for 4,275 yards and 36 touchdowns this season in  
leading the Wildcats (7-5) to their first seven-win season since 
1984 and their first New Year's Day bowl appearance since 1952. He 
finished fourth in balloting for the Heisman Trophy, was a finalist 
for the Davey O'Brien Award as the nation's top college quarterback 
and was chosen Southeastern Conference Player of the Year.

	Impeachment Trial Begins Thurs.  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Impeachment trial proceedings against  
President Clinton will begin Thursday in the Senate, Majority 
Leader Trent Lott announced today. Lott, R-Miss., said he had met 
earlier in the day with Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle and 
Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who will preside over the first 
presidential impeachment trial in 130 years. The Senate will rule 
on two articles of impeachment the House approved Dec. 19. In order 
to remove Clinton from office, two-thirds of the 100 senators must 
find him guilty of one of the articles.

	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Lauryn Hill received a leading 10  
Grammy nominations today for her critically acclaimed debut solo 
album ``The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.'' Hill will compete 
against a nearly all-female field -- including Madonna, Sheryl Crow, 
Shania Twain -- for album of the year. Hill also received nods in 
the best new artist, pop, R&AMP;B, rap and producer categories. Twain 
and Crow tied for six nominations each. Record of the year nominees 
included Celine Dion's ``My Heart Will Go On,'' Twain's ``You're 
Still the One,'' the Brandy &AMP; Monica duet ``The Boy Is Mine,'' the 
Goo Goo Dolls' ``Iris'' and Madonna's ``Ray of Light.''

	Saddam Urges Arabs To Support Iraq  
</P>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein today urged  
Arabs to back Iraq and to rise up against Arab leaders who have not 
given his regime full support. The statement was broadcast hours 
after four U.S. fighter jets fired missiles at Iraqi planes in the 
``no-fly'' zone over southern Iraq, according to a U.S. official in 
Washington. The U.S. missiles apparently failed to hit the Iraqi 
planes, although one Iraqi plane was believed to have crashed, 
apparently after running out of fuel, the official said.

	Record Low Temps Hit Illinois  
</P>
<P>
	MERIDIAN, Miss. (AP) -- The storm that dumped as much as two feet  
of snow on some parts of the nation has much of the country in deep 
freeze today. The arctic blast plunged the eastern two-thirds of 
the nation to record low temperatures. This morning dawned as the 
coldest on record in Illinois with a reading of 36 degrees below 
zero at the town of Congerville, about 120 miles southwest of 
Chicago in the central part of the state. The state's previous 
all-time record of 35 below was set on Jan. 22, 1930, in Mount 
Carroll in northwestern Illinois. Wind chills on the northern 
Plains measured 60 below zero. Temperatures were in the teens 
across much of the South.

	SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- Republican Sen. John Ashcroft announced  
today he would seek a second Senate term rather than run for 
president. Analysts say Ashcroft faces a tough re-election 
challenge from popular Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan in 2000, when 
the Republican Party risks losing its Senate majority. Ashcroft's 
decision comes a day after Elizabeth Dole announced she was leaving 
the Red Cross, possibly to pursue a run at the White House in 2000.

the Vatican's news agency was irresponsible in reporting the arrest 
of the Rev. Li Qinghua. The agency reported yesterday that Li was 
arrested and tortured in November. China's State Religious Affairs 
Commission denied any knowledge of the case.

	Vietnam War Napalm To Be Destroyed  
</P>
<P>
	FALLBROOK, Calif. (AP) -- More than 3 million gallons of napalm  
that's been stored at a San Diego naval station since the Vietnam 
War is going to be shipped to Louisiana to be destroyed. The 3.2 
million gallons of napalm has been stored in open fields at the 
Fallbrook Naval Weapons Facility in 35,000 aluminum canisters since 
1973. Navy officials declined to say how much Rhodia, a chemical 
plant in Baton Rouge, La., will be paid to burn the napalm. 
However, getting rid of the stuff will cost about $39 million 
total.

	FDA OKs Drug for Dog Depression  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government has approved the first drug for  
a dog, an antidepressant called Clomicalm that promises to help 
alleviate separation anxiety that afflicts thousands of pooches, 
and is one of the most common reasons that dogs are euthanized. 
Dogs are pack animals, behavior specialists explain. So for some, 
being left alone even for short periods can prove stressful and can 
result in chewing furniture and urinating on a rug.

<HEADLINE> Foreman-Holmes Fight Unlikely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Larry Holmes may still fight at some point in  
the next month. He just may not be trading punches with George 
Foreman. 
</P>
<P>
	Promoter Roger Levitt was not available for comment Tuesday  
regarding the status of the Jan. 23 heavyweight fight at the 
Houston Astrodome. But Holmes lawyer, Russ Sauer, said Tuesday 
night that the fight is in serious jeopardy of being canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Larry is frustrated for this thing to fall apart at this late  
hour,'' Sauer said. ``This is a fight we've been working on for 
more than five years. He's in good shape and wants to get in the 
ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sauer added that Levitt's alternative plan, should Foreman back  
out, is for Holmes to fight James Toney, who is scheduled to fight 
on the undercard. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman was expecting a letter of credit, which guarantees the  
fighters receive their entire purse. But two financial backers 
pulled out in recent weeks, putting the bout in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt said Monday he had secured an insurance bond that would  
guarantee Foreman the remaining $9 million of his $10 million 
purse. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Foreman's lawyer, Steve Katleman, told a Houston radio  
station Monday that Levitt missed two deadlines and would not 
accept the current proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``They received it and are not interested,'' Sauer said. ``If we  
don't get this resolved in the next 24 hours, we're done. Larry's 
been the ultimate good soldier the last two weeks, but now he's got 
to look out for himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt has already given Foreman $1 million and Holmes $400,000  
-- both of which are nonrefundable. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight was dubbed The ``Battle of the Aged.'' Foreman will be  
50 by the time of the bout and Holmes is 49. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes last fought in July 1997, when he won a decision over  
Maurice Harris. His career record is 66-6 with 42 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman's record is 76-5 with 68 knockouts, including a loss in  
his last fight to Shannon Briggs in November 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The bout is scheduled to be carried on pay-per-view for $39.95.

	JaRon Rush was suspended for his first Pac-10 game after a case  
of homesickness kept him from returning to UCLA on time. Arizona 
State wishes he missed one more. 
</P>
<P>
	The freshman swingman scored a career-high 19 points Monday  
night and the seventh-ranked Bruins beat Arizona State for the 20th 
straight time, 88-85 in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just sat there and thought I wanted to be out there on the  
court,'' Rush said of his one-game suspension for missing two 
practices and a game as he stayed a few extra days in Kansas City, 
Mo., after returning home for Christmas. ``I took out all the anger 
and frustration on them tonight. I'm just glad to be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rush played 34 minutes, and his two free throws with 2:02 left  
in overtime gave the Bruins (10-2, 2-0) an 85-82 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Batiste, who led the Sun Devils (8-6, 0-2) with 22 points  
and 12 rebounds, tied the game 85-85 54 seconds later. Freshman 
Jerome Moiso's free throw with 1:07 left gave UCLA the lead for 
good and Earl Watson's short jumper with 19 seconds left accounted 
for the final margin. 
</P>
<P>
	Batiste and Bobby Lazor each missed 3-point attempts and the Sun  
Devils lost at Pauley Pavilion for the 13th straight time. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the last shot, I had a decent look and it had a chance to  
go,'' Lazor said of his miss at the buzzer. ``It's the shot you 
dream of making, but I let the team down.''

overtime, had 11 points, including the Bruins' last five in 
regulation.

	``We're young, but we showed a lot of heart,'' he said. ``When  
you've got so many good guys and key guys come through, it means a 
lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither team led by more five points the entire game.  
</P>
<P>
	``They scratched, clawed and fought their way to victory,'' UCLA  
coach Steve Lavin said. ``This is the proudest I've been of our 
team in the three years I have been head coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First-year Arizona State coach Rob Evans found an upside to the  
loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played hard enough and we played well enough to win,'' he  
said. ``We didn't take care of details at crucial times, and when 
the game comes down to one bucket, that hurts you.''

<HEADLINE> WETA, Freedom Forum Plan Channel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A regional cable TV channel devoted to news  
and public affairs being created by public TV station WETA and The 
Freedom Forum should debut this spring, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Freedom Forum, a private foundation that advocates speech  
and press freedoms, is financing the multimillion-dollar venture, 
while WETA, a major producer of public TV shows, will contribute 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial details involving the proposed channel were not  
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second cable TV channel announcement in the last two  
months by WETA, which serves the Washington area. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a natural fit and an extension of our core business,''  
said WETA spokeswoman Elise Adde. 
</P>
<P>
	No contracts to carry the channel on cable TV systems have been  
lined up yet for the commercial-free channel, which will be called 
the Forum Network, the network's president, Ed Turner, a founding 
executive of CNN, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	But Turner and others involved in the venture were optimistic  
that carriage agreements would be reached in the spring with cable 
systems serving the Washington area, which includes parts of 
Virginia and Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	The channel's targeted audience is typical Washington types:  
politicians, government policy-makers, lobbyists, journalists and 
interested citizens, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
	The channel ``will go beyond sound-bite journalism and provide  
programming for an educated and engaged news audience,'' said 
Charles Overby, chairman and chief executive of The Freedom Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	While the network intends to create some of its own programs,  
key programming will include WETA productions such as ``The 
NewsHour With Jim Lehrer'' and ``Washington Week in Review'' as 
well as other public affairs and news shows available through 
public television. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, WETA announced its first foray into the cable  
business with a new, advertiser-supported cable network, called 
Fanfare, planned for November. It will be devoted to classical 
music.

<HEADLINE> Sports Car Market Getting Crowded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Aging, affluent baby boomers are driving the  
rising demand in the U.S. sports car market, so much that a trio of 
foreign automakers is about to enter the increasingly crowded 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	At the North American International Auto Show, Nissan Motor  
Corp. unveiled the prototype Tuesday for a new Z-car that the 
struggling Japanese automaker hopes will capture Americans' hearts 
the way the original 240-Z sports car did 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Audi AG, meanwhile, introduced its techno-cool TT  
Coupe with an aluminum and stainless steel body; it goes on sale 
next spring. They follow last week's unveiling of the sleek Honda 
S2000 roadster in Los Angeles, slated to arrive on U.S. shores next 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	As production costs come down, more automakers are finding it  
profitable to develop high-performance ``road toys'' for a niche 
market that just a few years ago had relatively few entrants. 
</P>
<P>
	Len Hunt, vice president of Audi of America Inc., said the large  
number of prosperous, aging baby boomers is the main reason more 
automakers are attacking the sports car market. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's people saying, 'Listen, I've given a lot to the kids,  
I've had a station wagon, an SUV. I want something that's for me,' 
'' Hunt said. ``They are expressions of individual choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wes Brown, an analyst with Nextrend consultants in Thousand  
Oaks, Calif., says this decade's sports car revival also is part of 
the larger boomer-driven retro trend in the auto industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may not always be from a styling standpoint, but in terms  
of what those cars are, that concept is a trend from the past,'' 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	The past certainly is evident in Nissan's Z concept, which  
borrows the long hood, ``sugar scoop'' headlight wells and sweeping 
front fenders of the original 240Z that debuted in 1969 in the 
United States and was an instant hit. The concept car is a far more 
aerodynamic interpretation of the original's fastback shape. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan, which has become known more for bland, safe designs this  
decade, has high hopes for the Z to restore its image as a 
manufacturer of innovative, stylish yet affordable cars -- and to 
help get it back into the black financially. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael J. Seergy, vice president of Nissan North America Inc.,  
said a final decision on putting the car into production will be 
announced by April. While executives said they were not worried 
that the sports car segment was too crowded, they acknowledged that 
Nissan can't afford anything less than a hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, it's a risk,'' said Jerry Hirshberg, president of  
Nissan's California design studio where the Z concept was penned. 
``Nissan can't afford to make a misstep right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seergy said he wants the Z to be a high-volume car, with sales  
as high as 100,000 a year. The car ``has a soul and character unto 
itself that we think will make it special. We're going to build and 
price it so most people can afford a Z.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan's goal is to price the car below $25,000, which would put  
it at the lower end of the sports car market with the popular Mazda 
Miata. The rear-drive car likely will be powered by a four-cylinder 
engine, but a six-cylinder engine may also be offered. Hirshberg 
said Nissan also is looking at a convertible version. 
</P>
<P>
	Audi's Hungarian-built TT is almost identical to the 1995 show  
car of the same name. It's unusual among sports cars in that the 
engine drives the front wheels. An all-wheel-drive option will be 
offered by next fall, and a roadster is planned by early 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The car has a 1.8-liter, turbocharged, four-cylinder engine that  
produces 180 horsepower. Audi says safety also is a selling point: 
it had two side-impact airbags in addition to front airbags. 
</P>
<P>
	The car is classified as a 2-plus-2, which means it has the kind  
of back seat useful mostly for holding shopping bags or punishing 
your passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunt said Audi hopes to sell 10,000 TTs in its first full year,  
but for this year only 4,000 will be available in the United 
States. The car will be priced from $30,000 to $35,000, putting it 
in competition with the new Honda and BMW's Z3 roadsters. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all automakers care to test the sports car market. Dodge,  
for example, sells the expensive Viper -- a low-volume image car -- 
but has ignored the lower end of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Gale, who heads design for the Dodge, Chrysler, Plymouth and  
Jeep brands of DaimlerChrysler AG, said new sports cars tend to 
have short cycles of popularity that make it difficult for a 
high-volume automaker to justify the investment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've studied it,'' Gale said. ``I think there are plenty of  
areas for us to go that maybe aren't quite so crowded.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Trial To Begin on Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's impeachment trial will  
begin Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said Tuesday, 
although agreement eluded party leaders on the length of the 
proceeding or whether witnesses will be summoned to the Senate 
chamber to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has to be done not only expeditiously, but fairly,'' Lott  
said after meeting with Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle and 
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who will preside over a trial 
unlike any other in the past 130 years. 
</P>
<P>
	With the 106th Congress scheduled to convene Wednesday, fresh  
criticism surfaced among Republicans over a bipartisan proposal for 
a truncated proceeding as short as a week, and the likelihood grew 
of a longer trial -- perhaps lasting well into February. 
</P>
<P>
	The uncertainty persisted as the Senate's senior Democrat,  
Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, said that on the final vote on the 
articles of impeachment, ``I could go either way based on the 
evidence as I've seen it or heard it. And I've followed it pretty 
closely,'' he added in an interview on C-SPAN.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd's comments represented the first indication that any of the  
45 Democrats in the Senate might vote to convict Clinton and remove 
him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite efforts to create an atmosphere of bipartisanship in the  
first presidential impeachment trial since 1868, there were clear 
differences between the parties. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Senate sources who spoke on condition of anonymity,  
Lott said in closed-door meetings during the day that following 
Thursday's largely ceremonial events, he wants opening arguments 
presented the following Monday by representatives of the House and 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, a member of the GOP  
leadership, said he envisioned giving each side three or four days 
to present its evidence. Each could then submit a list of witnesses 
for the Senate to subpoena, subject to a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not at all worried about a two-to-three week process that  
could take us into mid-February,'' Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Daschle, who agreed the ceremonial opening was likely for  
Thursday, told reporters his preference was for no witnesses. He 
added he wants a vote on censuring the president after an expected 
rejection of the articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said that simply starting the trial without a defined  
plan for proceeding would be an ``invitation to a prolonged process 
that would take weeks if not months, probably months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it was a measure of the uncertainty surrounding the  
historic event that Daschle told reporters at days' end neither he 
nor Lott would be presenting formal proposals in separate 
closed-door caucuses of Senate Democrats and Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved articles of impeachment on Dec. 19, alleging  
that Clinton committed perjury and obstructed justice as part of a 
months-long campaign to cover up his sexual relationship with 
Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Under congressional rules, the new House must vote after  
Wednesday's swearing-in ceremonies to reauthorize the presentation 
of evidence in the Senate. Republican vote-counters expressed 
confidence they had the votes to prevail, despite the loss of five 
House seats from the old Congress to the new. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said that by his announcement, Lott meant that those  
House members, led by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., would be permitted 
into the Senate chamber on Thursday morning to read the articles of 
impeachment, the event that will trigger the trial. Rehnquist would 
then be called after noon to administer a special oath to senators, 
who will sit as a jury deciding Clinton's fate. Rehnquist will be 
sworn in first, most likely by Sen. Strom Thurmond, the Senate 
president pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
	These officials said it was unclear what the next step would be.  
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart said the uncertainty  
leaves the president's lawyers ``in the position of preparing for 
all eventualities. In general, we'd like to know which direction 
we're going in, but we understand the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, in particular, has been struggling in recent days to  
coalesce Republicans around a set of ground rules that Democrats 
would also agree to. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., and Joseph Lieberman,  
D-Conn., suggested a one-day presentation of evidence for the 
House, followed by a one-day rebuttal by the White House and 20 
minutes set aside for each lawmaker, after which there would be a 
test vote to see whether two-thirds of the Senate thought the 
evidence was impeachable, if proven. If that failed, the next step 
would be a vote to adjourn the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	That plan divided the GOP leadership, as well as members of the  
rank and file, as several senators cautioned against 
short-circuiting a trial mandated in the constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., became the latest to object, when  
he issued a statement saying the House ``should be given a 
timetable to make a reasonably full presentation of the evidence -- 
certainly greater than just one day, as should the president's 
defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his comments, Lott made no reference to the issue of  
witnesses, or what timetable the Senate would follow. 
</P>
<P>
	And while Democrats have indicated support for the shortened  
proceedings, the White House signaled on Monday it will present an 
aggressive defense if the Senate conducts a full-blown trial. 
</P>
<P>
	That, in turn, could lead to a highly charged event in which key  
witnesses in the presidential sex-and-cover-up drama are called to 
testify, Ms. Lewinsky among them. 
</P>
<P>
	The only precedent for a presidential impeachment trial is that  
of Andrew Johnson in 1868. He remained in office after being 
acquitted when the Senate fell one vote shy of the two-thirds 
majority needed to remove him. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a fresh indication of the divergence of opinion, Sen.  
Judd Gregg, R-N.H., called a news conference to object to any 
proposal for censuring the president -- the very remedy that many 
Democrats favor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Impeachment is the constitutional action available to the  
Congress, not censure,'' he said, adding that future Congresses 
should not be permitted to intimidate presidents by threatening 
them with censure over policy matters.

<HEADLINE> IOC Calls Samaranch Gifts Common </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee on  
Tuesday acknowledged its leader, Juan Antonio Samaranch, accepted 
firearms from Salt Lake Olympic boosters and that such gift-giving 
is commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC rules impose a $150 limit on gifts to committee members, but  
a top official of the organization implied that limit doesn't apply 
to Samaranch, who does not vote on which cities will play host to 
the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The exchange of gifts on the occasion of visits by the IOC  
president is customary and it has almost become a matter of 
protocol to do so,'' Francois Carrard, the IOC's director general, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	His acknowledgment of the practice was in response to a report  
Tuesday in The Salt Lake Tribune that Samaranch received two guns 
worth $1,000 from the Salt Lake bid committee a month before Salt 
Lake won the right to host the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's confirmation of the delivery of the Browning guns to  
Samaranch's office came amid four investigations into claims that 
local Olympic officials bribed IOC members for their support. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Organizing Committee has acknowledged funding  
scholarships for at least six relatives of IOC members, providing 
free medical care, including cosmetic surgery, to visiting IOC 
members, and handing out lavish gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the bribery scandal broke, Samaranch said the IOC  
would investigate and expel members found extorting favors from bid 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
	While Samaranch does not vote on cities' bids to host the games,  
he has a say in who sits on the 115-member IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC president received, in his official capacity as IOC  
president on behalf of the IOC, one Browning pistol and one 
Browning rifle,'' Carrard said in a letter to the Tribune made 
available to The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Browning, based in Mountain Green, Utah, said  
records of the delivery in May 1995 show a semiautomatic shotgun 
valued at about $475 and a bolt-action rifle, which retailed for 
about $500, were given to Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Browning spokesman Travis Hall said late Tuesday that the  
company was still searching for an invoice on a pistol. 
</P>
<P>
	The rifle was in a case with an engraved plaque saying,  
``Presented to President Juan Antonio Samaranch from the Browning 
Arms Co. on behalf of the people of Salt Lake City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard said such gifts are either put on display at the IOC  
headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, or stored. He did not say 
what happened to the guns from Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC critic and journalist Andrew Jennings said he is more  
surprised by the type of gifts Samaranch received than the fact the 
head of the Olympic movement accepted gifts and the IOC was 
admitting it. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is this organization that claims to promote world peace  
doing accepting guns?'' Jennings said, referring to the IOC's 
biennial resolution calling for a worldwide truce during the 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC observers agree gifts such as those from Utah arrive  
regularly at IOC headquarters and the organization views such 
exchanges as appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch had also reportedly received a Ute Indian headdress  
and a quilt from Salt Lake bid officials. Browning has also said it 
sold $10,000 in guns to the bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``(IOC officials) were forced into responding to this because of  
the media frenzy,'' said John MacAloon, an anthropology professor 
at the University of Chicago and recognized authority on the 
Olympic movement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake scandal, which is being investigated by three  
Olympic committees and the federal Justice Department, has been 
described as the worst crisis ever to strike the Olympic movement. 
But MacAloon said Samaranch could use it to his advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC president has proposed that host cities be selected by  
the executive board that he heads. Samaranch has made similar 
proposals in the past but they were opposed by IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives him some leverage,'' MacAloon said. ``He is  
aggressively pursuing it. This is the payoff for him in this 
scandal.''

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A lawyer for the man convicted of killing  
Bill Cosby's son says his client deserves a new trial because 
prosecutors relied on phony evidence drummed up by an admitted 
forger. 
</P>
<P>
	Six jailhouse letters used against Mikail Markhasev actually  
were written by David Gomez, a convicted forger serving a lengthy 
prison term, according to public defender Henry Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Markhasev has been sentenced to life in prison without parole  
for killing 27-year-old Ennis Cosby, who was shot in January 1997 
while changing a flat tire on a dark road. 
</P>
<P>
	In his Dec. 23 petition to re-open the case, Hall cited Gomez's  
testimony in an unrelated murder trial that he forged the Markhasev 
letters and sold them to the National Enquirer for $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Markhasev letters, I did those ... I'm a dirty bird,''  
Gomez testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall did not return phone calls Monday. But during Markhasev's  
trial, he alleged that Gomez faked evidence against Markhasev to 
gain favor with prison authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Gomez is serving a 91-year-to-life term for multiple felony  
convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	The case against Markhasev was highly circumstantial, based in  
part on the letters and on testimony from a man who collected a 
$100,000 reward from the National Enquirer for pointing police 
toward Markhasev. 
</P>
<P>
	The only eyewitness in the case was unable to identify Markhasev  
as the assailant and initially picked someone else from a police 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Gomez never was called as a witness at the trial, and a  
handwriting expert testified that at least several of the letters 
were written in a hand similar to Markhasev's. 
</P>
<P>
	The district attorney's office said Monday it would not comment  
on Hall's petition, except to say that the office stands by the 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	The key letter describes a plan to go to Bel-Air, a wealthy area  
of Los Angeles, and rob ``a connection'' -- apparently a drug 
dealer. The letter says the target was not home. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter includes the statement: ``The crime happened in  
Bel-Air. A robbery gone bad'' and concludes: ``I went to rob a 
connection and obviously found something else.'' It is signed 
``Peewee,'' which was Markhasev's gang nickname.

<HEADLINE> Grammy Nominations To Be Handed Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Since Lauryn Hill won two Grammys  
as part of the hip-hop trio the Fugees, she has emerged as a music 
star in her own right. 
</P>
<P>
	Her solo album, ``The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,'' won  
critical acclaim last year and could bring her yet another Grammy -- 
for album of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Celine Dion, Shania Twain and Will Smith, Hill was  
among the favorites to receive Grammy Award nominations today. The 
41st annual awards ceremony will be held next month in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill's ``Doo Wop (That Thing)'' also was a favorite for  
nomination as record of the year, along with Dion's ``My Heart Will 
Go On,'' and Twain's ``You're Still the One.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Natalie Imbruglia's big radio hit ``Torn'' was a contender for  
best record, along with ``The Boy is Mine'' by Brandy &AMP; Monica, 
``Truly Madly Deeply'' by Savage Garden, Smith's ``Gettin' Jiggy 
Wit It'' and ``I Don't Want to Wait'' by Paula Cole, last year's 
best new artist. 
</P>
<P>
	Also favored in the best album category was Dion for ``Let's  
Talk About Love,'' which contains the hit single ``My Heart Will Go 
On,'' the theme song from the movie ``Titanic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hill and Dion were expected to compete for best album with  
Twain, whose ``Come On Over'' has sold more than 6 million copies; 
and Madonna, who received her best reviews for ``Ray of Light.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the best new artist category, leading contenders were Hill,  
teen sensations 'N Sync and the Backstreet Boys, Lucinda Williams, 
Imbruglia and the country trio Dixie Chicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Two new categories have been added this year to acknowledge the  
growth of dance music in the pop world. Awards for best dance 
recording and re-mixer of the year were added, along with a Latin 
alternative rock album award, bringing to 92 the number of Grammys 
that will be presented. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards will be presented Feb. 24 at the Shrine Auditorium in  
Los Angeles during a three-hour ceremony to be telecast live on 
CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	The show originated in New York the past two years, and Michael  
Greene, president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and 
Sciences, has said the awards will return to that city. 
</P>
<P>
	But Los Angeles officials are lobbying to have the 2000 show  
held in the Staples Center, which is under construction downtown 
and scheduled to open this fall.

<HEADLINE> St. John's Cracks Top 10 in AP Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	St. John's had been absent from the Top Ten a lot longer than  
California had been missing from the rankings altogether. Yet 
players from both teams sounded the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have to play regardless,'' St. John's guard Bootsy  
Thornton said Monday when asked about the Red Storm's first 
appearance in the Top Ten since Dec. 16, 1991. ``The other teams 
don't stop playing because of a number.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cal guard Thomas Kilgore wasn't exactly overjoyed either about  
the Golden Bears entering the rankings Monday for the first time 
since a one-week appearance during the 1996-97 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, I take it with a grain of salt,'' he said. ``It's  
something that somebody labels you. Unnecessary pressure. The Top 
25 is good, but you still have to go out and perform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There weren't many changes in the latest AP college basketball  
poll as Connecticut was No. 1 for the sixth straight week, although 
the Huskies' lead over No. 2 Duke was sliced by 15 first-place 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut (11-0) was No. 1 on 55 ballots and received 1,756  
points from the national media panel after decisive wins last week 
over Villanova and Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils (13-1), who convincingly beat then-No. 4  
Maryland on the road Sunday, received 13 first-place votes and 
1,698 points. 
</P>
<P>
	In last week's poll, the Huskies had 63 first-place votes and  
1,763 points, while Duke had six and 1,687. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati (12-0), the only team to beat Duke this season,  
remained third after beating North Carolina-Wilmington in its only 
game last week. The Bearcats received three first-place votes, one 
more than the previous poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford and Maryland switched places at Nos. 4 and 5, while  
Kentucky moved up one spot to No. 6. UCLA, which handed Arizona its 
first loss of the season last weekend, moved from 10th to No. 7 and 
was followed by Arizona, Purdue and St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina, which holds the longest current streak of being  
ranked at 143 weeks, dropped from ninth to No. 11 after losing to 
California and beating Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tar Heels started their run of consecutive polls with the  
preseason poll of 1990-91, two polls longer than Kentucky's current 
streak and 10 longer than Kansas'. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State was 12th, followed by Indiana, Auburn, New  
Mexico, Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas, Arkansas and Syracuse. The last 
five teams in the poll were Clemson, Texas Christian, Oklahoma 
State, Wisconsin and California. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh (8-5) dropped out of the rankings from No. 23, having  
lost four of its last five games. The Panthers had been ranked for 
five straight weeks, reaching as high as No. 20, after beating 
Xavier and Kentucky on consecutive nights in the Puerto Rico 
Shootout. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky extended its streak of being in the Top Ten to 85  
polls, a run that started Feb. 14, 1994. Duke has the 
second-longest Top Ten streak at 33 weeks, while Connecticut, at 
17, and Stanford, at 10, are the only others in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
	This week was Kentucky's 600th appearance in the poll, a number  
second only to North Carolina's 608. UCLA, at 528, is the only 
other school to appear more than 500 times in the AP rankings, 
which started Jan. 20, 1949.

<HEADLINE> Warrick Likely To Return to FSU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- All-American receiver Peter Warrick is  
giving Florida State fans at least a small reason to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick, one of the first players off the plane at Tallahassee  
Regional Airport on Tuesday night, softly answered ``probably'' 
when asked if he would be back with the Seminoles next season. But 
he refused to elaborate or answer any other questions as he walked 
through the terminal. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bobby Bowden, picking up his luggage at the baggage claim,  
said he hasn't talked with Warrick recently about whether he'll 
return for his senior season or go pro. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Warrick only caught one pass in Monday's 23-16 Fiesta  
Bowl loss that cost Florida State a national championship, his 
speed and dazzling moves could make him a high pick in the NFL 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hasn't talked about what he's going to do,'' Bowden said.  
``The last time I talked to him, he wasn't sure what he was going 
to do. I think he'll probably go. I wish he wouldn't. I wish he'd 
stay. He could probably be one of the best in the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That also was the sentiment of quarterback Chris Weinke, who  
hopes to return next season. Weinke, who started 10 games before 
being sidelined with a season-ending neck injury, said the star 
receiver could even win the Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like he's the best big-time player in the country,''  
said Weinke, who expects to be back for spring practice next 
season. ``I don't know what he'll do, and I don't want to say one 
way or the other. I know his heart was broken when we didn't win 
the national championship, so maybe that will be an incentive for 
him to come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick's decision will have to come soon. He must declare NFL  
eligibility by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a small gathering of fans greeted the players, whose flight  
out of Tempe, Ariz., was delayed for about four hours. Most of 
those fans attended the game and arrived on an earlier flight, but 
their luggage was on the team plane, so they had to wait. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was disappointed, yes, but I think we're still No. 1,''  
Jacksonville resident Vicki Shafer said as she picked up her 
luggage. ``I think we're still a better football team than 
Tennessee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles weren't even in a position to play for the title  
until two teams ahead of them lost late in the season, but Bowden 
said that didn't make the loss any easier. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't ease it,'' he said. ``After it gets over, you look  
back and you realize, hey, we did a real good job and we got there. 
We were one of the two teams in the country that got there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Bowden didn't talk with any of the players on the plane, and  
sophomore offensive tackle Ross Brannon said it was a quiet flight. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was pretty somber, but you can only dwell on it for so  
long,'' Brannon said. ``I thought we beat ourselves. With the 
mistakes we had, we didn't deserve to win. But we've got a lot of 
people coming back here next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One faithful Florida State fan, Julian Bennett of Panama City,  
said he was proud of his team. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did the best they could,'' said Bennett, a member of the  
Board of Regents. 
</P>
<P>
	But then he paused and said, ``Well, they could have played  
better. And they know it.''

<HEADLINE> Alleged Gang Figure Captured in Fla. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Police captured a man believed to be behind gang  
violence that led to the killings of 12 people last year, including 
his girlfriend and cousin. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony ``Little Bo'' Fail, 25, was arrested early today at a  
West Palm Beach motel after a SWAT team threw a stun grenade into 
the room to disorient him. No shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's safe to assume that he was surprised,'' said Miami Police  
Lt. John Campbell said. Two others who were with Fail at the time 
were being questioned. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators say Fail is the common thread in a dozen slayings  
since August as drug gangs battle for the takeover of the ``John 
Does'' -- a gang that controls much of the drug trade in Liberty 
City, a poor Miami neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Fail allegedly left the gang to start a rival faction.  
</P>
<P>
	Fail was wanted on two counts of attempted murder stemming from  
an August incident in which an 8-year-old girl was injured by a 
stray bullet in a Liberty City market owned by her family. Campbell 
said additional charges will probably be brought. 
</P>
<P>
	Police are attributing other recent killings in Liberty City to  
rivals retaliating against Fail. Fail's girlfriend, cousin and a 
friend who may have been helping to hide him have been ambushed and 
killed in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very violent guy,'' Campbell said. ``He was a cause of  
a lot of the shooting. They're going to keep killing each other, 
but hopefully this will slow things down a bit.''

<HEADLINE> Holmgren Begins `Whirlwind Tour' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Mike Holmgren has three weeks to decide  
whether to accept his final year with the Green Bay Packers. He 
doesn't plan to take that long to decide his future. 
</P>
<P>
	Either he'll sign on with another team that gives him total  
control, or he'll return from visits to Seattle, Baltimore and 
Philadelphia and sign an extension with the Packers next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me to leave, it has to be something very special, it has  
to be exactly right,'' Holmgren said. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing Holmgren said he won't do is fulfill only the final  
year on his contract in Green Bay, which contains an escape clause 
that gives him until Jan. 25 to take a job as a coach and general 
manager somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going through this again. It's too hard on  
everybody,'' said Holmgren, who has been the subject of constant 
rumors for nearly a year. ``As much as you try to balance it, as 
much as you try to block things off, eventually we're human and it 
wears on the principles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks appear to be the strongest suitor for Holmgren, but  
he denied he was close to signing with them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just finished our season Sunday and I really expected our  
season to last longer,'' Holmgren said. ``The clubs contacted the 
Packers yesterday. Now the process starts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One city conspicuously missing from Holmgren's travel itinerary  
is Cleveland. Browns president Carmen Policy, who worked with 
Holmgren in San Francisco, was fined $10,000 last month by the NFL 
for tampering after alluding to the coach during a civic luncheon. 
But the expansion team has not yet contacted Holmgren for a formal 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren, who said he didn't expect interest from any other  
teams, planned to fly to Seattle today, Baltimore on Friday and 
Philadelphia on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be one of those whirlwind tours,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He indicated, however, that he might cancel those other visits  
if the Seahawks make him an ideal offer. Owned by Microsoft 
co-founder and billionaire Paul Allen, the Seahawks are loaded with 
young talent, have a new stadium planned for 2002 and are willing 
to play the free-agent market. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren also emphasized his happiness working with Packers  
general manager Ron Wolf and said he still might decide to stay in 
Green Bay and sign an extension that would make him the NFL's 
highest-paid coach at about $4 million a season. The offer has been 
on the table since August. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't imagine a better working relationship between two men  
in our positions in football or in any professional sport,'' 
Holmgren said about Wolf, who hired the coach in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great, great football job here. So why am I even  
considering any of this other stuff? Because of the challenge, and 
I've always tried to push myself to limits and extend myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren said even if he decides to stay in Green Bay, he'd  
still want to be a general manager someday. The coach has guided 
the Packers to six straight postseason berths, two Super Bowls, one 
NFL championship and an 84-42 record in seven seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks fired coach Dennis Erickson last month, and team  
president Bob Whitsitt said he hasn't ruled out hiring one man to 
serve as coach and GM. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks, Ravens and Eagles contacted Wolf on Monday for  
permission to talk with Holmgren, who said he hopes to have his 
future decided by next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren disagreed that his uncertain future hurt the Packers,  
who fell from the Super Bowl to 11-6 also-rans, losing Sunday to 
the 49ers in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think injuries hurt the team,'' Holmgren said. ``That's what  
hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf said the Chicago Bears were granted permission to talk to  
offensive coordinator Sherm Lewis, and the Eagles were given the OK 
to interview quarterbacks coach Andy Reid about their head coaching 
vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
	Both are considered possible replacements for Holmgren, but Wolf  
told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that the successor he has in 
mind isn't on the Packers staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the person was available now, Wolf said, ``Not right  
now he's not.'' That would seem to indicate he's considering a head 
coach or an assistant with a team still in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Packers president Bob Harlan said he hopes Holmgren stays, but  
won't begrudge him leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him, `I know what your goal is. If it happens, we would  
just thank you for what you've done here and wish you well,''' 
Harlan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Any team that signs Holmgren would owe Green Bay a second-round  
1999 draft pick as compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	Harlan also said he extended Wolf's contract through 2003 and  
gave him a raise to about $2 million a year -- tops in the league -- 
after Wolf turned down offers to go to Seattle and Philadelphia 
last winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just kind of rewarded what he's accomplished and the fact  
that he has been very loyal to us,'' Harlan said.

<HEADLINE> Chargers Interview OSU's Riley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- San Diego Chargers president Dean Spanos spoke  
glowingly about coaching candidate Mike Riley on Tuesday, even 
saying that he might be the guy to bring along troubled quarterback 
Ryan Leaf. 
</P>
<P>
	The buzz around the NFL is that Riley, the coach at Oregon  
State, will become the Chargers' next coach. But Spanos said Riley 
might not necessarily have an offer in hand when he heads back to 
Corvallis on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't made a deal,'' Spanos said late Tuesday afternoon.  
</P>
<P>
	Then again, the second meeting between Riley and the Chargers  
was expected to go late into the night, and things could change. A 
team spokesman said no news conference had been scheduled for 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a serious candidate, there's no doubt about it,'' Spanos  
said. ``He's a great guy and everything. We're talking to him. 
That's where we're at right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spanos said Riley is one of two leading candidates to replace  
June Jones, who became coach at Hawaii. Neither Spanos nor general 
manager Bobby Beathard will identify the other candidate, except to 
say he's a college coach. Beathard didn't make himself available 
for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've know Bobby Beathard for a while, and obviously follow the  
league and the people within this organization, and I'm very 
interested,'' Riley said after arriving at the San Diego airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley compared the situation to when he left Southern Cal, where  
he was offensive coordinator, to take the Oregon State job in 
December 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``It passed in front of my plate, and I took the opportunity,''  
said Riley, who played high school football in Corvallis before 
playing defensive back for Bear Bryant at Alabama. ``If indeed this 
one does, I'll have to make a decision about it. That's all pretty 
good stuff, but it's a little bit agonizing, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One NFL assistant said the rumors of Riley going to the Chargers  
``are real strong in our league. Bobby Beathard is hand-picking 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spanos also met with Riley last weekend and is clearly impressed  
with the 45-year-old coach, who is 8-14 in two seasons at 
perennially downtrodden Oregon State. The Beavers were 5-6 this 
year, narrowly missing their first winning season since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really like the things that he had to say. He's very  
personable, very smart,'' Spanos said. ``That's subjective, 
obviously. I think he's the type of guy that could step into this 
type of situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The situation, of course, is that the Chargers (5-11) need an  
offensive-minded coach who can guide them out of a three-year 
slide, which was made worse when Leaf, the second pick in the 
draft, was a bust on the field and a problem off it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Bobby and I both felt that we're much better than our  
record would indicate,'' Spanos said. ``The thing that's really 
lagging with us right now is obviously our quarterback. I think he 
(Riley) brings a lot to that situation, in terms of development. 
Again, it's subjective, but I think that Bobby and I think he'd be 
a real great fit for Ryan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers want their new coach to keep the defensive staff  
intact, as well as retain offensive line coach Joe Bugel. The 
Chargers' defense ranked No. 1 overall and against the run. 
</P>
<P>
	Spanos didn't think Riley, who met with several assistants on  
Tuesday, would have a problem with that request. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers would like to have a coach hired within a week,  
Spanos said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the college candidates don't pan out, Beathard has two or  
three candidates in mind from the NFL ranks. He's believed to be 
interested in San Francisco offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg, 
but can't contact him until the 49ers' playoff run ends. 
</P>
<P>
	If Riley remains at Oregon State, he'll get a contract  
extension, athletic director Mitch Barnhart said Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Alyssa Milano Gets Married </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Alyssa Milano charmed musician Cinjun August  
Tate so much that he decided to make her his wife. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Stocks Higher; Dow Up 48 Points / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were firmer at midday, with blue-chips  
lifted by a broad mix of technology, financial and industrial 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
48.40 at 9,232.67. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were higher as well, with the Standard  
&AMP; Poor's 500 index up 5.87 at 1,233.77 , and the technology-heavy 
Nasdaq composite index up 17.31 at 2,225.36, in record territory 
for the second day in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 1,477 to 1,386 on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 541 unchanged. Volume came to 302.28 
million shares, down from Monday's midday pace of 376.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Jones industrial average components were led higher by IBM,  
up 2 at 185; United Technologies, up 1 7/8 at 109 78; AT&AMP;T, up 1 11/16 
at 79 9/16; Alcoa, up 1 9/16 at 75 5/16; and Procter &AMP; Gamble, up 
1 1/8 at 91 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Wachtel, market strategist at Prudential Securities, said,  
``It's a good, steady stockpicking market, nothing spectacular 
about it, but can't be spectacular because you had a spectacular 
quarter at the end of 1998. That's why they wacked it down 
yesterday. I really can't make a strong case for sustainability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wachtel said Investors are tentative in their enthusiasm in part  
because of the dollar, which has dropped against the yen and pulled 
bond prices lower as the new Euro began trading Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was little affected by a Commerce Department report  
that U.S. construction spending increased for the sixth consecutive 
month in November, propelled by strong gains in housing and 
government projects. Spending advanced 0.9 percent from the month 
before to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $677.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online shares, which were added to the S&AMP;P 500 last  
week, were leading the Big Board in volume and up 1/8 at 148 15/16. 
AOL announced today that CBS News will provide text, audio and 
video to the online service and its affiliated CompuServe service, 
replacing ABC. CBS shares were up 3/4 at 32 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	AirTouch shares were up 5 at 73 1/4 after the company received a  
buyout offer from Britain's Vodafone Group PLC. Shares of Bell 
Atlantic, which was already in talks to buy AirTouch, were up 1 3/8 at 
53 5/16.

<HEADLINE> Okla. City Bomb Witness in Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Michael Fortier, whose testimony helped convict  
two former Army buddies of the Oklahoma City bombing, says he 
should get a lighter sentence because the judge wrongly believed he 
helped finance the plot. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief filed Tuesday at the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of  
Appeals, attorney Michael McGuire contended prosecutors never 
proved Fortier helped Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols pay for the 
April 19, 1995, bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States has never believed or had any credible  
information that Michael Fortier sold firearms to support the 
bombing,'' McGuire said. ``If this was truly the case, Fortier no 
doubt would have been charged like McVeigh and Nichols.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Van Bebber based his 12-year jail  
sentence and $200,000 fine in part on a finding that Fortier helped 
pay for the bomb by giving McVeigh some of the money he made 
selling guns stolen from an Arkansas gun dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	A former serviceman from Arizona, Fortier served in the Army  
with McVeigh and Nichols and pleaded guilty to failing to alert 
authorities in advance about the plot to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah 
Federal Building. The blast killed 168 people and injured hundreds 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	He also pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents and transporting  
stolen firearms. Fortier testified at the trials of both McVeigh 
and Nichols. 
</P>
<P>
	McVeigh was convicted of federal murder, conspiracy and weapons  
counts last year. He is appealing his jury-imposed death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy  
last year and sentenced to life imprisonment.

	JaRon Rush was suspended for his first Pac-10 game after a case  
of homesickness kept him from returning to UCLA on time. Arizona 
State wishes he missed one more. 
</P>
<P>
	The freshman swingman scored a career-high 19 points Monday  
night and the seventh-ranked Bruins beat Arizona State for the 20th 
straight time, 88-85 in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just sat there and thought I wanted to be out there on the  
court,'' Rush said of his one-game suspension for missing two 
practices and a game as he stayed a few extra days in Kansas City, 
Mo., after returning home for Christmas. ``I took out all the anger 
and frustration on them tonight. I'm just glad to be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rush played 34 minutes, and his two free throws with 2:02 left  
in overtime gave the Bruins (10-2, 2-0) an 85-82 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Batiste, who led the Sun Devils (8-6, 0-2) with 22 points  
and 12 rebounds, tied the game 85-85 54 seconds later. Freshman 
Jerome Moiso's free throw with 1:07 left gave UCLA the lead for 
good and Earl Watson's short jumper with 19 seconds left accounted 
for the final margin. 
</P>
<P>
	Batiste and Bobby Lazor each missed 3-point attempts and the Sun  
Devils lost at Pauley Pavilion for the 13th straight time. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the last shot, I had a decent look and it had a chance to  
go,'' Lazor said of his miss at the buzzer. ``It's the shot you 
dream of making, but I let the team down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other games involving ranked teams Monday, it was: No. 3  
Cincinnati 75, Marquette 56; No. 4 Stanford 77, Oregon 59; No. 8 
Arizona 87, Southern California 78; No. 10 St. John's 115, Niagara 
70; Fresno State 86, No. 15 New Mexico 80; and No. 25 California 
54, Oregon State 52. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA point guard Baron Davis, who fouled out 29 seconds into the  
overtime, had 11 points, including the Bruins' last five in 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're young, but we showed a lot of heart,'' he said. ``When  
you've got so many good guys and key guys come through, it means a 
lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither team led by more five points the entire game.  
</P>
<P>
	``They scratched, clawed and fought their way to victory,'' UCLA  
coach Steve Lavin said. ``This is the proudest I've been of our 
team in the three years I have been head coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First-year Arizona State coach Rob Evans found an upside to the  
loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played hard enough and we played well enough to win,'' he  
said. ``We didn't take care of details at crucial times, and when 
the game comes down to one bucket, that hurts you.'' 
</P>
<P>
                   *No. 3 Cincinnati 75, Marquette 56    	
</P>
<P>
	Pete Mickeal led a balanced attack with 14 points as the  
Bearcats (13-0, 2-0 Conference USA) matched the second-best start 
in school history. The 1959-60 Cincinnati team also started 13-0 
and the 1962-63 team won its first 19 games. Both those teams 
reached the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>

Cardinal (12-2, 2-0 Pac-10) won their eighth straight game. Alex 
Scales had 16 points for the Ducks (9-2, 1-1), who lost for the 
11th consecutive time at Maples Pavilion. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> CBS Nabs 4th Straight Nielsen Lead / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- CBS is on a roll.  
</P>
<P>
	The network claimed its fourth consecutive ratings victory last  
week, dominating the holiday airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boy, this feels good,'' CBS Television President Leslie  
Moonves said Tuesday after the figures were released by Nielsen 
Media Research. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sunday-night lineup of ``Touched by an Angel,'' ``60  
Minutes'' and an airing of the Harrison Ford film ``Sabrina'' gave 
CBS the three top-rated programs last week. The Kevin 
Costner-Whitney Houston movie ``The Bodyguard'' also was a hit, 
ranking eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC, meanwhile, had a case of the holiday blues. The network  
tied for third place with Fox, with none of its shows in the top 10 
and only two in the top 20. Its popular Thursday night programs 
like ``Friends'' and ``ER'' couldn't compete with New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
	For Dec. 28 to Jan. 3, CBS had a 9.2 average rating and 15  
share. ABC, boosted by ``NFL Monday Night Football'' and college 
bowl games, was second with an 8.5 rating and 14 share. NBC and Fox 
had 7.1 ratings and 12 shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the fledgling networks, WB was the front-runner with a 2.9  
rating and 5 share, compared to UPN's 1.5 rating and 3 share and 
PAX TV's 0.7 rating and 1 share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. Share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS is not a one-week wonder. For the season to date, its 9.1  
ratings average puts it first place, ahead of NBC's 8.7. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS has been buoyed overall by its acquisition of NFL  
broadcasts, which are drawing more young male viewers to the 
network. Traditionally, CBS audiences have been older and heavily 
female. 
</P>
<P>
	``Men, more specifically men under the age of 35, did not know  
CBS existed,'' Moonves said. ``Now they're saying `Gee, they've got 
a show called `JAG,' they've got a show called `Martial Law.' 
They've got a show called `Walker, Texas Ranger.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the evening news programs, NBC's ``Nightly News'' was the  
most-watched with a 9.0 rating and 17 share. ABC's ``World News 
Tonight'' had a 8.3 rating and 16 share and ``CBS Evening News'' 
had a 8.0 rating and 15 share. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, the top 10 shows, their networks and ratings were:  
``Touched By an Angel,'' CBS, 16.4; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 14.3; 
``CBS Sunday Movie: Sabrina,'' CBS, 14.0; ``Rose Bowl (postgame): 
UCLA vs. Wisconsin,'' ABC, 13.9; ``Fox NFC Wildcard (postgame): 
Green Bay at San Francisco,'' Fox, 12.1; ``NFL Monday Night 
Football: Pittsburgh at Jacksonville,'' ABC, 11.5; ``Sugar Bowl: 
Ohio State vs. Texas A&AMP;M,'' ABC, 11.5; ``CBS Tuesday Movie: The 
Bodyguard,'' CBS, 11.1; ``The X-Files,'' Fox, 10.5; ``20-20 
(Sunday),'' ABC, 9.8.

<HEADLINE> Long-Term Care Insurance Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When AT&AMP;T began offering long-term care  
insurance to its workers in 1993, Burke Stinson didn't want to 
think about the possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	But after watching his mother quickly lose her life savings when  
she was placed in a nursing home following a brain seizure, Stinson 
had a change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life can change on a moment's notice and I want to spare my  
family as much pain as I can,'' said Stinson, 57, AT&AMP;T's senior 
public relations director from Basking Ridge, N.J. who pays $700 
annually for a long-term insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Stinson is one of a small but growing number of Americans buying  
long-term care insurance through the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
	Available since the mid-1980s, long-term care insurance today is  
viewed much the way Individual Retirement Accounts and 401(k) plans 
were in the '70s. Consumers are not convinced they need them. 
</P>
<P>
	But that view is slowly fading. On Monday, President Clinton  
proposed making private long-term care insurance available to all 
federal employees, retirees and their parents at negotiated group 
rates. The White House also proposed a massive education campaign 
to inform Americans that most long-term care is not covered by 
Medicare, the federal insurance program for the elderly and 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-term care insurance executives say the initiatives, which  
must be approved by Congress, would boost sales by raising 
awareness and adding some legitimacy to their product. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the executives acknowledge the industry has a long way to  
go if it ever wants to get consumers to consider long-term care 
insurance in the same breath as health, life and automobile 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Without coverage for long-term care, thousands of Americans each  
year become impoverished so they can qualify for state and federal 
Medicaid, which pays for the bulk of nursing home care. But that 
system often means a spouse or other family members also face 
financial catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-term care insurance aims to cushion consumers and their  
families from that scenario. Insurance coverage can vary markedly 
with some plans paying for only nursing home care or for only 12 
months of coverage. Yet, more companies now offer policies that 
cover the gamut of long term needs from assisted living facilities 
to home care to nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
	Premiums can vary from $25 to $35 a month for people in their  
30s to more than a $100 a month for those over 60. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting coverage through an employer aids consumers on two  
fronts: Policies are sold at a discount and workers cannot be 
turned down or given a higher premium because of a medical 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike health insurance, employers offering long-term care  
insurance usually do not help pay part of the premium. Rather, they 
just make the plan available. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, about 120 companies provide long-term care insurance to  
over 6 million people, according to the Health Insurance 
Association of America. In addition, an estimated 2,000 employers 
have now sponsored a long-term care insurance plan for their 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	At companies that do offer long-term insurance benefit, usually  
less than one in five workers buys a policy. Experts say that 
reflects how much of the population believes they will never need 
the coverage, or they think the insurance will be too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 Health Insurance Portability Act gave the market a  
boost by allowing employers to deduct from their taxes the amount 
they pay in long-term care insurance premiums. The Clinton proposal 
is seen as a positive next step. 
</P>
<P>
	``This sends exactly the right message to the world that the  
government is not going to take care of us and people ought to take 
personal responsibility,'' said Steve Wnuk, vice president of 
marketing for Milwaukee-based Fortis, a large seller of long-term 
care policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will make long-term care insurance move from being a  
cutting edge benefit to a more mainstream benefit,'' said Janice 
Stanger, a principal with William M. Mercer consulting firm in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	One problem Clinton did not address is that the benefits of some  
long-term care policies may now be taxed. Also, the government 
limits the deductibility of long-term care insurance premiums for 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Uretsky, an insurance broker in Peabody, Mass., said  
insurers have failed to educate public about the need for coverage. 
``They've tried to sell it like life or disability and that hasn't 
worked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Insurance executives agree talking to consumers about the need  
for coverage is often difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who thinks about this stuff until it's in your face,'' said  
Nancy Magee, vice president of Unum, a Portland, Maine-based 
long-term care insurer.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 126.92 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks posted strong gains Tuesday, again  
pushing the Nasdaq and Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 indexes to record 
highs, as investors ignored a slumping dollar and bonds and 
warnings about weak profits from a handful of companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts saw signs of a traditional January rally, in which  
investors use yearend bonuses and other cash reserves to embark on 
new stock strategies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 126.92 to 9,311.19,  
missing a new record by 36 points. Advancing issues outnumbered 
decliners by nearly 5 to 4 on the New York Stock Exchange, where 
volume came was heavy at 946.53 million shares as of 4 p.m., but 
off from Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite rose to record territory for the third  
straight session and the seventh in 10 sessions, to close at 
2,251.27, up 43.22. The S&AMP;P 500 rose 16.68 to 1,244.78, topping its 
previous closing record of 1,241.81 on Dec. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's decline against the Japanese yen put pressure on  
the price of U.S. bonds, but not stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Canelo, market strategist at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter,  
said the weakness of the dollar against the yen wasn't that 
important for the stock market because the dollar rose against the 
new euro, which began trading on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	While Japanese investors are big buyers of U.S. bonds, they're  
not big players in the U.S. stock market, Canelo explained. The 
reverse is true for European investors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the dollar is off against the yen, then you can look for  
U.S. bonds to be lower, but if it's lower against European 
currencies, then you can expect U.S. stocks to be down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A weak bond market causes interest rates to rise, which is  
sometimes a concern to stock investors fearful of an erosion in 
corporate profits. Tuesday, however, that wasn't a major concern 
because stock investors were more interested in putting yearend 
cash bonuses to work in the stock market, Canelo said. ``The fact 
that they keep buying equities is a vote of confidence in the 
American economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-four of the 30 Dow Jones industrials components were  
higher at the close, including such diverse names as IBM, Alcoa, 
Procter &AMP; Gamble and United Technologies. Even the shares of 
companies that depend on commodities prices, which currently are 
depressed, were higher, such as International Paper. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect that the Asian economies will bottom out toward the  
middle of the year,'' Canelo said. ``That means that commodity 
prices will stabilize in the first half'' of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecommunications stocks rose on merger talk. AirTouch  
Communications rose 9 1/4 to 77 1/2. Britain's Vodafone PLC made a 
counteroffer to buy the company, threatening to derail a $45 
billion bid from Bell Atlantic Corp. Bell Atlantic rose 3 1/16 to 
55. Vodafone's U.S. shares rose 4 1/2 to 179 1/8. Dow component AT&AMP;T rose 
1 5/8 to 79 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks rose despite some profit warnings.  
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com shares closed up 6 3/16 to 124 1/2 after recovering from  
a sharp morning slide. The Internet bookseller said fourth-quarter 
sales more than tripled from a year ago, but it warned that even 
those big sales gains will not reduce its expected losses for the 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft moved up 5 1/2 to 146 1/2. A Lehman Brothers analyst raised  
the firm's 12-month price target on the stock to 185 a share from 
140. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Levens Tries To Forget Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Dorsey Levens, who broke his right leg in  
Green Bay's second game after a training camp holdout, says the 
next month is going to be tougher to take than those two absences 
from the football field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until the Super Bowl is over,'' he said. ``It's kind of hard  
watching games where you think you should be playing. But I think 
once that's all said and done, everybody's going to look forward to 
getting ready to come back next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And nobody is as eager to erase Green Bay's 11-6 season and  
early exit from the playoffs than Levens. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been tough, but it's over,'' Levens said. ``You take it  
with a grain of salt and move on. You can't really dwell on it. A 
lot of things I wanted to accomplish this year early on, but with 
the contract holdout and the injury, all that was put on the back 
burner. So I've just got to put it behind me and get ready to play 
next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levens said he'll have an operation this week to remove a screw  
that surgeons implanted in his left ankle three months ago, then 
resume workouts after a six-week recovery time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers' season began to go downhill after Levens broke his  
left leg and severely damaged ligaments in his left ankle in Week 2 
after touching the ball 58 times in six quarters just two weeks 
after ending his holdout. 
</P>
<P>
	Without him, the Packers' running game sputtered, and both  
Raymont Harris and Travis Jervey also broke legs filling in while 
Levens missed nine games. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, the receivers began going down, first Derrick Mayes, then  
Robert Brooks, Bill Schroeder and Corey Bradford, plus tight ends 
Mark Chmura, Tyrone Davis and Jeff Thomason. 
</P>
<P>
	The revolving door of runners and receivers led to Brett Favre's  
23 interceptions, one shy of his career high. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Holmgren, who could coach elsewhere in 1999, said he  
didn't feel as though he failed with Favre, who never quit throwing 
into coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never stopped listening, ever,'' Holmgren said. ``I think  
if you wanted to analyze those plays this year, he threw too many 
interceptions. He knows that. But he did it because he felt we 
didn't have a lot of other people that could make the play for a 
long stretch in there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, right or wrong, that's how he felt.''  
</P>
<P>
	Levens returned Nov. 29 and began to stabilize the Packers'  
offense. But he really didn't have have a game resembling his Pro 
Bowl form of 1997 until Sunday, when he rushed 27 times for 116 
yards and a touchdown and caught six passes for 37 yards at San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also had a second-quarter fumble that led to a 49ers  
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``After I fumble, it just burns me up like you wouldn't  
believe,'' Levens said. ``I don't want to be a liability to my 
team. I had something to prove to my teammates. I think that added 
a little fuel to the fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levens said his lost season ``makes me more hungry.''  
</P>
<P>
	``I worked probably as hard as I could this offseason while I  
was at home,'' he said. ``Then to get injured, it's like it's all a 
waste. So you've got to go back, start from square one and just do 
it all over again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Levens agreed to report, the Packers removed their  
franchise tag from him and worked out a five-year, $25 million deal 
with their star halfback. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers are expected to place that franchise tag on All-Pro  
receiver Antonio Freeman, who led the league in yards receiving, 
caught 14 touchdown passes, made the Pro Bowl and All-Pro teams for 
the first time and caught two TD passes Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	His touchdown catch with 1:56 left put the Packers on top 27-23  
before Terrell Owens' thrilling scoring play with three seconds 
left ended Green Bay's season. 
</P>
<P>
	What advice does Levens have for Freeman, expected to seek  
upwards of $6 million a season? 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him I'll give him my itinerary from July to September,  
let him know exactly what's going on and what to do because he may 
not be here,'' said Levens, who missed all the team's minicamps and 
training camp after the Packers put their franchise tag on him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything's possible,'' Freeman said of getting a deal worked  
out before the Feb. 11 deadline for franchise designations.

<HEADLINE> Bobby Unser's Conviction Is Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Three-time Indianapolis 500 winner Bobby Unser's  
conviction and $75 fine for snowmobiling in the South San Juan 
Wilderness Area in southern Colorado were upheld Monday by the 10th 
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	The auto racing great from Albuquerque could have been sentenced  
to six months and fined $5,000, or both, under the Wilderness Act 
of 1964 
</P>
<P>
	Unser fought the U.S. District Court conviction on grounds he  
and a friend became lost in a blizzard on Dec. 20, 1996, their 
snowmobiles broke down and they wandered for two days before being 
rescued. 
</P>
<P>
	Unser also argued that government prosecutors never proved  
criminal intent in violating the Wilderness Act, and that he wasn't 
advised of his rights during talks with two Forest Service agents, 
who he believed would help him locate and retrieve one of the 
snowmobiles, following the ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court held that the charge may be proven without  
proof the defendant intended to take the snowmobile into the 
protected area or even knew he had done so. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be impractical to expect the boundaries of wilderness  
areas could be policed in such a way that the government would have 
access to evidence to disprove a necessity defense'' and could 
impede enforcement of the law, the appeals court said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lower court also was upheld in finding ``Unser had not  
proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the emergency arose 
before he entered the wilderness area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unser said his statements to the Forest Service agents should  
have been suppressed because he was subjected to questioning 
without being advised of his Miranda rights and were the product of 
deception by the agents. 
</P>
<P>
	The court found that Unser was not coerced, was not in custody  
and the statements were voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
	The court also noted Unser had two men with law enforcement  
backgrounds accompany him to the meeting with the agents, 
suggesting ``that Unser had some idea he might be under 
investigation for entering the wilderness area with his 
snowmobile.''

<HEADLINE> W.Va. Coal Industry Under Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (AP) -- The brilliant glass facade of the  
one-time Ashland Coal Co. headquarters stands now as grim prophecy 
on the future of Appalachia. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashland, now known as Arch Coal Inc., is still one of the  
state's largest producers, and West Virginia's coal output is 
setting records and exceeds every state but Wyoming's. 
</P>
<P>
	But the economic, regulatory and environmental pressures have  
never been greater on Appalachian and other producers. The 
availability of too much coal means competition is fierce, and the 
difference between success and failure can be measured in pennies a 
ton. 
</P>
<P>
	As companies respond, the nature of coal mining and the  
communities that depend upon it inevitably are changed. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past decade, coal operators have moved away from  
labor-intensive underground mining toward large-scale strip mining 
that is cheaper, safer and more efficient. Once thought practical 
only in the relatively level terrain of the Midwest and the Far 
West, ``mountaintop removal'' is taking hold in the steep hills of 
Appalachia. 
</P>
<P>
	The same period has seen the number of U.S. coal miners fall by  
more than half: from 169,280 in 1985 to 83,460 in 1996, according 
to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-extraction methods also shorten the lifespan of a mine.  
Where a new mine once could be expected to provide work for 
generations to come, the work now is generally completed in as 
little as 10 or 15 years, sometimes barely long enough for a miner 
to vest his pension. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the gleaming building that once bustled with Ashland's  
well-paid engineers, geologists and other professionals, it now is 
occupied by $17,000-a-year telemarketers selling secured credit 
cards to high-risk borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, we have become steadily more dependent on coal since  
the 1973-74 oil embargo by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, coal provides one third of all the energy consumed in the  
United States, and more than 56 percent of the country's 
electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has an estimated 4 trillion tons of coal  
reserves, more than any other country. Less than a tenth of that 
can be mined with existing technology, enough coal to last 250 
years at current consumption rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Underground miners still outnumber those employed on strip mines  
nearly two to one. But about 61 percent of U.S. coal production 
comes from strip mines. With high-extraction techniques, operators 
can recover more than 90 percent of the available coal with a 
fraction of the manpower. 
</P>
<P>
	In Appalachia, seams that once were mined underground now are  
strip mined with the help of earth-moving machines bigger than many 
office buildings. More than 300,000 acres of West Virginia had been 
strip mined as of 1997, according to the federal Office of Surface 
Mining. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	West Virginia officials can't say for sure how many acres are  
being mined under so-called mountaintop removal ``variances,'' 
which exempt operators from having to return the land to its 
``approximate original contour'' after mining. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, mountaintop removal operations dispose of waste by  
layering it in adjacent stream beds as ``valley fill.'' When the 
mining is completed, the site becomes flat or gently rolling 
instead of the steep hillsides that are the region's trademark. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents who live adjacent to the mines complain about dust,  
noise and damage to their homes from the blasting. 
Environmentalists complain that vital water resources are buried 
when operators dispose of mining spoil by layering it in adjacent 
streambeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawsuits pending in state and federal courts seek to halt  
large-scale strip mining through one line of attack or another. 
</P>
<P>
	But the most sweeping of those challenges recently was settled  
out of court. The lawsuit was filed by environmentalists against 
the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers, the Office of Surface Mining and other federal and state 
agencies. It challenged mountaintop removal operations and the 
legality of valley fill. It also contended that the federal 
agencies were not using the same yardstick in assessing mines in 
different states. 
</P>
<P>
	In the settlement, federal agencies agreed to take a unified  
approach to reviewing plans for large strip mines and to review 
each one individually. The agencies also agreed to conduct a 
two-year environmental study on mountaintop removal mining and 
valley fills. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement also cleared the way for a new mining permit for  
Arch Coal to expand an existing operation into the largest 
mountaintop removal mine in the state, covering some 10 square 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Michael McCabe, administrator of EPA's  
Philadelphia-based Region III, said the settlement will slow the 
expansion of strip mining. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's really going to change the way mountaintop mining  
is conducted in the Appalachian region,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time that the EPA and the Office of Surface Mining  
are reviewing the way coal is produced, another branch of the EPA 
is looking at a different environmental regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Limits on sulfur pollution were imposed during the 1990s by the  
Clean Air Act, decimating the high-sulfur coalfields of northern 
West Virginia, western Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Then last September, in the next step of the Clean Water Act,  
the EPA ordered 22 states -- most in the Ohio Valley and Midwest -- 
and the District of Columbia to reduce their emissions of nitrogen 
oxide, another pollutant emitted by coal burned for electricity. 
West Virginia has to reduce its pollution levels by a greater 
percentage than any other state. 
</P>
<P>
	The purpose, the EPA said, is to reduce smog flowing into the  
Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	Some coal producers worry the restrictions could push utilities  
to switch to natural gas. But others believe more utilities will 
turn to a method of burning coal known as selective catalytic 
reduction. The process circulates gases from burning coal back into 
the fire, substantially reducing nitrogen oxide emissions without 
significant modifications. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	For Appalachian coal producers, there are more immediate threats  
-- cheaper coal from the Far West. 
</P>
<P>
	While producers in Appalachia struggle to produce coal from  
seams measured in inches, producers in the Powder River Basin of 
Wyoming mine seams of 20 feet to 80 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation problems once made it impractical for Powder  
River Basin coal to compete for sales to the Ohio River Valley, but 
that has started changing with new railroad alliances. 
</P>
<P>
	And western coal's low-sulfur content makes it desirable for  
meeting pollution limits -- even though it takes roughly 30 percent 
more Powder River Basin coal to produce the same amount of energy 
in a ton of Appalachian coal. 
</P>
<P>
	Appalachian coal that sold for $100 a ton in the heady days  
following the oil embargo now sells, at best, for $30 a ton. Powder 
River Basin coal is often in the range of $3 to $13 a ton. 
</P>
<P>
	Such price differentials have made it impossible for the  
high-sulfur coal of northern West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana and 
Illinois to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Wyoming produced about 26 percent of the nation's coal.  
West Virginia produced about 16 percent of the U.S. total. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The effects of the economic changes are being felt already in  
the Appalachian region. 
</P>
<P>
	Coal operators have engaged in a long-running campaign to cut  
costs, through more productive technologies that need fewer 
laborers and through the use of independent contractors instead of 
staff employees. 
</P>
<P>
	In West Virginia there are 18,000 miners directly employed by  
coal operators, and another 33,000 people working as contractors to 
the mining industry, said Bill Raney, president of the West 
Virginia Coal Association. 
</P>
<P>
	That, according to J. Davitt McAteer, the assistant U.S.  
secretary of labor for mine safety, has led to increased injuries 
and death, with a disproportionate number of independent 
contractors killed in mining accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	And wages also are dropping.  
</P>
<P>
	``In West Virginia, we've already seen a drop in average  
earnings across the state. And in other coal regions, Kentucky, 
Ohio, Indiana, southern Illinois, unemployment is high. Lots of 
folks have lost their jobs in the last 15 years,'' said United Mine 
Workers President Cecil Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who are used to having good-paying jobs in the past are  
out there struggling now,'' he said. ``You find yourself 50 years 
of age and unemployed after 20 years in the coal industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the coal industry has been reshaped through mergers  
and consolidations. Ashland Coal merged in 1997 with Arch Mineral 
Corp. to form Arch Coal, the state's second largest coal producer. 
Last year, the headquarters were consolidated to St. Louis, leaving 
the tall, modern building of the former Ashland Coal sitting vacant 
in Huntington.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Urges Arabs To Support Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein today urged  
Arabs to back Iraq and to rise up against Arab leaders who have not 
given his regime full support. 
</P>
<P>
	``Revolt, sons of the great Arab nation, against injustice and  
let your voices be heard,'' Saddam said in a speech broadcast by 
Qatar's Al-Jazeera Television. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement was broadcast hours after four U.S. fighter jets  
fired missiles at Iraqi planes in the ``no-fly'' zone over southern 
Iraq, according to a U.S. official in Washington. It was the first 
American-Iraqi air-to-air confrontation in more than six years. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. missiles apparently failed to hit the Iraqi planes,  
although one Iraqi plane was believed to have crashed, apparently 
after running out of fuel, said the official, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Saddam made no mention of the air-to-air confrontation in the  
parts of the speech carried by Al-Jazeera, and it was unclear if it 
was recorded before or after the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Saddam's statement was an apparent appeal to Arab masses,  
especially in countries such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia that Iraq 
has accused of failing to support its efforts to end sanctions 
imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	There were widespread protests in the Arab world during the Dec.  
16-19 airstrikes by U.S. and British forces against Iraq because of 
its failure to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
	Saddam did not mention any Arab leaders by name.  
</P>
<P>
	But he did note that there were Western troops ``in the land of  
the holy sites'' -- a reference to Saudi Arabia -- and said Western 
aircraft attacking Iraq were flying from Arab nations and Arab 
waters. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, a U.N. official said that U.S. and British  
humanitarian aid workers have not encountered security problems in 
Iraq despite tensions between their governments and Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
	The official, George Somerwill, spoke a day after Iraq asked the  
United Nations to replace U.S. and British aid workers in the 
country. Baghdad said it cannot protect them from popular anger 
following +U.S.-British airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Aid workers ``have not encountered any problems related to their  
safety,'' Somerwill said. 
</P>
<P>
	The humanitarian aid workers, who oversee a U.N.-approved  
oil-for-food program, were withdrawn from the country briefly 
during the mid-December bombardment. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. and British airstrikes targeted Iraqi military and  
communications centers after U.N. arms inspectors accused Baghdad 
of obstructing their efforts to eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass 
destruction as required by U.N. resolutions that ended the 1991 
Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iraqi government has said it will not renew the visas of  
nine Britons and one American working with the oil-for-food 
program, which allows Iraq to pump $5.2 billion in oil and purchase 
food, medicine and other humanitarian goods. 
</P>
<P>
	However, four Britons and three Americans will be allowed to  
remain in Iraq, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Somerwill said the absence of the Americans and Britons would  
have little impact on the program, which has some 400 staff members 
throughout Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Seek More Base Closures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton intends to ask Congress for  
authority to close more U.S. military bases starting in 2001 to 
help offset the cost of military force improvements, officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress approved several rounds of base closings earlier this  
decade but since the last round in 1995 has rejected several 
attempts by the Clinton administration to further shrink the 
far-flung network of bases developed during the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will include his base-closure plan in the fiscal 2000  
budget proposal he sends to Congress in February, said Robert Bell, 
senior director of defense programs at the White House's National 
Security Council. Clinton announced last weekend that his budget 
plan will include a $12 billion defense spending increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell said it would take about a 10 percent cut in the overall  
U.S. military base structure to make it fit today's smaller 
military, which has shrunk steadily since the end of the Cold War. 
He would not say how many bases Clinton wants to close. 
</P>
<P>
	The key point, Bell said, is that the Pentagon needs to be able  
to cut its costs. ``It's going to be incumbent on Congress to 
cooperate and give us that authority,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Without explicit authority from Congress, the Pentagon cannot  
close bases of substantial size. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration hopes it can win congressional approval by  
arguing an urgent need to achieve more defense savings and by 
pointing to examples in which communities have turned the setback 
of a base closing into long-term economic gain, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Capitol Hill, the nation's top military officers pressed the  
case for more base closings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting rid of the excesses that we have now ... would be very  
beneficial,'' Army Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee. He said 
the savings could amount to up to $15 billion over the next five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell said Clinton's fiscal 2000 budget proposal would include a  
request for Congress to authorize two more rounds of base closings 
starting in 2001. He said the administration is counting on savings 
from new base closures of $2 billion to $3 billion through 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has come under attack from many congressional  
Republicans for allowing the state of readiness of U.S.-based 
troops to deteriorate in recent years. Bell, in remarks to 
reporters at the White House, said one reason for this erosion of 
military readiness is Congress's repeated refusal to allow savings 
from new base closings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not easy for them to, just out of spite, or whatever is  
motivating this, decide not to take an obvious source of $2 billion 
or $3 billion in savings,'' Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Defense Secretary William Cohen tried unsuccessfully  
to win congressional authority for base closings in 2001 and 2005. 
Although some in Congress favor more closures, many fear the 
economic backlash felt in communities dependent on the military. 
</P>
<P>
	Some in Congress also have accused Clinton of having manipulated  
the 1995 base-closing process for his political advantage, 
particularly with bases in vote-rich California and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on  
Tuesday, the top military brass welcomed Clinton's announcement 
Saturday that he would seek military spending increases of more 
than $100 billion over the next six years in his new budget, 
beginning with a $12 billion boost next year, although they said 
more was needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is still another $30 billion to $40 billion in  
requirements that are not met,'' said Shelton. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he testified, ``it will meet our most critical needs.''  
</P>
<P>
	Republican members of the committee complained that Clinton's  
request was inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I desire to add funds to the president's mark,'' said the  
committee's incoming chairman, Sen. John Warner, R-Va. He said the 
difference between what the chiefs wanted and what the president 
was requesting was significant. 
</P>
<P>
	The military chiefs testified in September before the same  
committee that roughly $150 billion in additional spending was 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing has changed since we last met,'' Shelton said.

<HEADLINE> Man Accused in Flight Fracas Pleads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A man charged with attacking a flight attendant  
on a plane was wandering around first class before the fracas, 
saying he was Jesus and blessing passengers by tapping them with a 
pillow, witnesses testified. 
</P>
<P>
	It took five people to subdue Dean Trammel, 22, during the  
December 1997 US Airways flight from Los Angeles to Baltimore, one 
witness testified Monday, the first day of Trammel's trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had the strength of 10 men,'' said Peter Rebstock, a pilot  
who was riding in first class as a passenger. ``It was a 
free-for-all -- he was biting and thrashing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trammel pleaded not guilty Monday in federal court. He is  
charged with assault and interfering with a crew member aboard a 
flight, both felonies. The trial continued today. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight attendant Renee Sheffer said Trammel flung her over three  
rows of seats and kicked her when she tried to restrain him. He 
also predicted the plane was going to crash and that he needed to 
get into the cockpit to bless the crew, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he was Jesus,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers asked U.S. District Judge Catherine Blake to  
consider finding Trammel not criminally responsible -- the 
equivalent of an insanity defense. 
</P>
<P>
	After the plane landed, Trammel told Maryland Transportation  
Authority Police he had ``a couple of drinks and went crazy'' while 
on the plane. But at a hearing in Baltimore two days later, a 
corrections officer told a judge that Trammel said he had taken 
LSD. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebstock said he had warned the flight crew before the fight  
that Trammel was acting strangely -- wandering around first class 
and blessing passengers by tapping them on the shoulder with an 
airline pillow. 
</P>
<P>
	Trammel was finally subdued when Ms. Sheffer, Rebstock, the  
other pilot, a military policeman and a male flight attendant 
hog-tied him with seat belts, plastic handcuffs and even an airline 
necktie. 
</P>
<P>
	The Association of Flight Attendants, a union that represents  
43,000 flight workers nationwide, said assaults on flight 
attendants may have doubled in the last several years. Most 
airlines are reluctant to report such incidents to the Federal 
Aviation Administration, said union spokeswoman Cynthia Kain, 
because ``they don't want passengers to think their airline is 
rowdy.''

<HEADLINE> California Governor, Mayor Sworn In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Democrat Gray Davis took his oath of  
office as California's 37th governor, promising ``an administration 
that is at once tough-minded and big-hearted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 56-year-old Davis, whose career in state politics started  
more than two decades ago as chief of staff to then-Gov. Jerry 
Brown, promised Monday to seek bipartisan solutions and govern as a 
moderate. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, meanwhile, was beginning his own new career -- as mayor of  
Oakland -- by exhorting residents to create a renaissance in their 
troubled city. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' first speech as governor was laced with references to  
California's history. He pledged to build on the legacies of 
earlier generations, from Gold Rush pioneers to Silicon Valley 
entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today we begin a new chapter in the state's history: The era  
of higher expectations,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis devoted most of his speech to education, promising, among  
other things that any high school student who graduates in the top 
4 percent of the class will automatically be admitted to the 
University of California. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let it be said that in the most fundamental of mankind's  
purposes -- to nurture the next generation -- we did our duty,'' 
Davis said. ``We gave our children the tools to learn, to grow and 
to succeed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, meanwhile, was urging Oakland citizens to realize the  
possibilities of their city. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oaklanders, it's time,'' Brown said at a rally outside City  
Hall. ``By the tens, by the hundreds and then by the thousands, we 
will reclaim our streets, will reclaim our schools, will reclaim 
our city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was elected last June by a landslide. In November, he got a  
second vote of confidence when Oaklanders passed a measure that 
makes the city manager answerable to the mayor, not the city 
council. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland, a city of 396,000 predominantly minority residents, has  
been hit hard in recent years by earthquake, fire and recession. 
Brown offered a vision of better times Monday, declaring the city a 
haven of creativity, diversity and hope to cries of ``Yes!'' and 
``Amen!'' from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown moved to Oakland about four years ago with a luminous  
resume -- two-term governor, three-time presidential candidate, aide 
to Mother Teresa and former head of the state Democratic Party. He 
has since left the party and is registered as an independent. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who turned out was Julienne Brown, no relation, who  
paused on steps in front of City Hall to explain why she's so 
enthusiastic about her new mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jerry Brown is an honorable politician with integrity,'' she  
said. ``And I think that's very important. Particularly lately.''

<HEADLINE> Delta Expands Service to Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Delta Air Lines announced Tuesday an expansion of  
European service for the summer of 1999, including Atlanta's first 
nonstop service to Athens, Barcelona and Istanbul. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to look for additional opportunities to expand our  
international service,'' said Frederick W. Reid, the Atlanta-based 
carrier's executive vice president and chief marketing officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta also this summer will introduce service from New York's  
Kennedy Airport to Ireland, with nonstop flights to Dublin and 
Shannon. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid said Delta is seeking federal authority to operate an  
Atlanta-Rome nonstop service as early as April 1, and also hopes to 
initiate daily nonstop service from New York to Venice and from 
Atlanta to Milan. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the expansion comes at a time of global uncertainty  
about continued economic fallout from the Asian crisis, Reid said 
Delta's new routes are aimed at markets with strong economies and 
growth potential. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no doubt that there has been some softening in  
certain international markets,'' Reid said. ``All of these (new) 
routes are forecasting significant operating profits. So we're 
confident we're making a sound economic decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new schedule will give Delta service to 17 transatlantic  
markets from Atlanta and 20 from Kennedy Airport. And the 
international expansion follows last month's announcement of a new 
BusinessElite premium service designed for intercontinental 
business travelers.

<HEADLINE>  Apple's iMac Sports Four New Colors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Apple Computer Inc. intensified its  
challenge to conventional computer design Tuesday by unveiling four 
bright new colors for its unusual-looking iMac desktop machine. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also lowered the price on the iMac by $100 to $1,200  
and boosted its processing power and storage capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was part of a broad attempt by Apple to exploit the  
sudden popularity of the iMac -- introduced last August -- to win 
back users of computers based on Microsoft's Windows system. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also introduced new versions of its G3 computer line  
for professionals that cost less, sport more power and include a 
uniquely designed lever that allows users to easily open up the 
computer case to add memory or other features. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Jobs, Apple's interim chief executive, told the MacWorld  
computer show that Apple expected to report its fifth consecutive 
profitable quarter next Wednesday, furthering its recent recovery 
from two years of losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple's stock rose 5 percent, or $2.06 1/4 to $43.31 1/4, on the  
Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The iMac is now available in red, orange, purple, and green as  
well as its original color, teal. 
</P>
<P>
	The variety of colors will make the iMac's unusual translucent  
case, through which the computer's inner circuitry is faintly 
visible, stand out even more than before on the shelves of computer 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that people want to collect all five,'' Jobs joked, to  
the applause and whoops of thousands of Apple Macintosh fans at the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	Most personal computers are sold in beige or sometimes black,  
but the recent popularity of the iMac is leading other 
manufacturers to break with convention. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to its unusual look, the iMac combines the computer  
and the monitor and has its hook-ups conveniently located on the 
side instead of the rear. Industry observers expect other PC makers 
to start introducing desktop machines this year that emulate the 
iMac's design features. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every PC vendor I'm aware of is already working on a PC with a  
similar iMac look and feel,'' said Tim Bajarin, president of 
Creative Strategies, a technology consultant firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple has sold 800,000 iMacs since it was introduced on Aug. 15,  
making it the No. 1-selling PC at retail last November. That's 
still a fraction of the estimated 35 million to 40 million PCs sold 
worldwide over the same period. But Apple said 45 percent of iMac 
buyers were new Mac users, including first-time computer buyers and 
some former Windows users. 
</P>
<P>
	The iMac's success helped buoy the spirits of MacWorld  
attendees, who were too busy cheering to debate Apple's long-term 
prospects in an industry dominated by Windows machines. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a Mac user, it's encouraging to have Steve Jobs at the  
helm. It's his baby and he's not going to let it suffer,'' said 
Norm Daniels, who creates promotional videos for Home Lake 
Christian Camps, a youth camp in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Some observers worried that stores may have a tough time  
stocking all the new iMac colors, but Jobs said in a separate 
interview that wasn't a concern. 
</P>
<P>
	He stressed that the decision to choose a variety of colors  
recognizes that computer users want to express themselves through 
their machines. ``We chose colors that we thought reflected the 
spirit of the product,'' Jobs said. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple also is trying to increase its appeal to computer game  
players. The company boosted the ability of its G3 computer to play 
games with three-dimensional graphics and unveiled a new device 
that enables Mac users to play about 100 different software games 
designed for Sony's PlayStation video game system.

<HEADLINE> China OKs Beijing's Olympic Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China on Wednesday formally approved Beijing's  
bid to host the Olympic Games in 2008, saying having the games in 
China would help bring East and West closer together. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese capital's application to host the games was  
unanimously approved by a meeting of 75 members of the Chinese 
Olympic Committee, a committee statement said. The committee and 
the city will submit a formal bid to the International Olympic 
Committee in early February, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beijing was beaten out by Sydney for the right to host the 2000  
Olympics, partly because of concerns over China's human rights 
record and other problems. Stung by the narrow defeat, China did 
not bid for the 2004 games. 
</P>
<P>
	As a fast-developing country of 1.3 billion people, China  
``should make big contributions to humanity, should make 
contributions to the Olympic movement,'' said Wu Shaozu, head of 
the Chinese Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Holding the Olympic Games in China will benefit cultural  
exchange and blending between East and West, and benefit the global 
development of the Olympic movement,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Liu Jingmin, a vice mayor of Beijing, introduced the bid to the  
committee on behalf of the city's 12 million residents, the 
statement said. He promised that the city would create the 
necessary conditions and speed up building work to make its bid 
successful.

<HEADLINE> Ryan, Brett, Yount Elected to Hall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nolan Ryan, George Brett and Robin Yount were  
voted into the Hall of Fame today, the biggest class of first-time 
candidates since Babe Ruth and four others were chosen in the 
original election of 1936. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan, the greatest power pitcher ever with a record 5,714  
strikeouts and seven no-hitters, was named on 98.79 percent of the 
ballots -- one vote short of beating former teammate Tom Seaver's 
98.84 in 1992 for the highest total in history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly an honor that I was thought of on that level,''  
Ryan said. ``Tom was obviously one of the best pitchers I ever saw 
throw the baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brett, 13th on the career hits list with 3,154, made it with  
98.19 percent, the fourth-highest total. Yount, with 3,142 hits and 
two AL MVP awards, was elected with 77.46 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was flabbergasted. It just knocked me on the floor,'' Brett  
said of his vote total. ``Obviously, I was very, very pleased. But 
in all honesty, I was just as pleased for Robin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Of all the guys I played against,'' he said on a conference  
call, his voice cracking, ``probably Robin is the guy I enjoyed 
playing against the most.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To gain election, players had to be placed on 75 percent of the  
ballots cast by 10-year members of the Baseball Writers' 
Association of America. There were a record 497 ballots cast -- Ryan 
was named on a record 491, Brett 488 and Yount 385. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not one that ever takes this kind of stuff too seriously,  
but my stomach's kind of been in knots for three or four days, so 
maybe somebody's telling me this is pretty good stuff,'' Yount 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlton Fisk, another first-time candidate, fell 43 votes shy of  
the required 373 with 66.40 percent. Tony Perez missed in his 
eighth try with 302 (60.76 percent). 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth, Ty Cobb, Walter Johnson, Honus Wagner and Christy  
Mathewson were taken in the first election ever. Since then, never 
more than two first-timers had been taken, the last time in 1990 
when Jim Palmer and Joe Morgan made it. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 29 rookie candidates have been taken since that first  
election. Mike Schmidt had been the last to do it in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe DiMaggio, Roy Campanella and Harmon Killebrew were among the  
players who did not get elected on the first try. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the BBWAA voted in three players overall was 1991  
-- Rod Carew, Ferguson Jenkins and Gaylord Perry. 
</P>
<P>
	Induction ceremonies at Cooperstown are scheduled for July 25.  
The Hall of Fame exhibition will be the next day, and it seems 
fitting that Ryan's Texas Rangers will take on Brett's Kansas City 
Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hall's membership of 240 probably will increase again on  
March 2 when the Veterans Committee votes in Tampa, Fla. Former 
manager Dick Williams, Bill Mazeroski, Orlando Cepeda and Dom 
DiMaggio figure to draw support. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan held or shared 53 major league records when he retired in  
1993 after a 27-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan went 324-292 for the New York Mets, California, Houston and  
Texas, tying him with Don Sutton for 12th in victories. He said his 
Hall plaque would likely depict him in a Rangers hat. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he never won a Cy Young Award, and despite his .526  
winning percentage ranking the lowest among all 300-game winners, 
Ryan's sheer domination landed him a place in the Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett was a 13-time All-Star. The third baseman hit .305 in a  
21-year career spent entirely with the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	Yount played his whole 20-year career with Milwaukee and won MVP  
awards at shortstop and center field. He was a three-time All-Star 
and batted .285. 
</P>
<P>
	Not since that 1936 election has a player with 3,000 hits failed  
to be elected in his first year of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisk (376 HRs) holds baseball's record for most home runs by a  
catcher. In 24 seasons, his most memorable homer was the one that 
won Game 6 of the 1975 World Series at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez, who got 68 percent last year, had 1,652 RBIs, most among  
eligible players not already in the Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Murphy, another first-timer, received 96 votes. The  
seven-time All-Star hit 398 home runs and won five straight Gold 
Gloves in center field. 
</P>
<P>
	Other players falling short included Gary Carter (168 votes),  
Steve Garvey (150), Jim Rice (146), Bruce Sutter (121) and Jim Kaat 
(100). 
</P>
<P>
	Mickey Lolich, 217-191 and MVP of the 1968 World Series, and  
Minnie Minoso, a .298 career hitter, missed in their 15th and final 
time on the ballot. Minoso got 73 votes and Lolich got 26. 
</P>
<P>
	Pete Rose, still off on the Hall ballot because of his ban from  
baseball, got 16 write-in votes.

 *Useless Holiday Gifts Abound    	
</P>
<P>
	SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR THE PERSON WITH EVERYTHING: If you're still  
staring at the whatchamacallit your aunt gave you for Christmas, 
and wondering what on earth she saw in it, you have lots of 
company. American Express, which sponsors an annual contest to 
determine the most outrageous gift, found people get a lot of 
strange, useless or inappropriate stuff. The winning entries in the 
latest contest included a a dead cat's ashes, a girdle and a gift 
certificate to a defunct restaurant. There also was a jar of lint 
from someone's navel. The top prize went to a do-it-yourself mink 
coat kit, complete with a trap, skinner's knife and needle and 
thread.

<P>
	FIND A PENNY, PICK IT UP, AND TELL US YOUR DEMOGRAPHICS: A penny  
may not be worth that much anymore, but 75 percent of Americans 
will stop to pick them up in the street, according to a survey by 
Coinstar Inc. The survey of more than 1,000 adults found age is a 
big factor in whether people will pick up a penny -- 90 percent of 
respondents over age 65 said they'll pick one up, while two-thirds 
of respondents between 18 and 34 said they would do so. Those who 
won't pick change up in the street said they were too embarrassed, 
or that the street was dirty, or that someone else needed the money 
more than they did. And 12 percent of the respondents said they 
wouldn't pick up a coin if it was heads-down -- which some consider 
bad luck. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	MONEY OR BENEFITS?: Salary is still the priority for job  
seekers, but medical benefits and flex time are gaining in 
importance, reports Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas, an employment 
consulting firm. In a survey of job seekers, Challenger Gray found 
57 percent considered salary their primary concern. A few years 
ago, that figure would be closer to 90 percent, said chief 
executive John Challenger. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, 42 percent are looking first for good benefits. Challenger  
says many people looking for jobs in a strong economy feel secure 
about the salary they can earn, so they can focus instead on other 
factors.

<HEADLINE>  Apple's iMac Sports Four New Colors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The iMac personal computer, which some say  
helped save Apple Computer Inc.'s life, looks more like a Lifesaver 
than even before. Literally. 
</P>
<P>
	The unusual-looking translucent desktop now comes in five bright  
colors, from strawberry red to original teal, that are sure to 
further stand out on store shelves from traditional beige machines. 
</P>
<P>
	But are the popular new iMacs a one-product wonder, or can they  
help the company take a major bite again out of the market soundly 
controlled by Windows-based desktop machines? 
</P>
<P>
	With the iMac less than five months old, this year may prove  
crucial in deciding that question. As former Apple chief evangelist 
Guy Kawasaki notes, design alone can't help Apple sustain the 1980s 
revolution Apple spurred by simplifying the way computers interact 
with people. 
</P>
<P>
	``The iMac is an amazing marketing-industrial design type  
success,'' said Kawasaki, who had the important Apple job of 
prodding developers to write new software programs for the Mac. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is, What is the revolution? You can only design  
and redesign Apple so much,'' Kawasaki said in an interview this 
week at his Silicon Valley office, where he runs a business that 
helps match start-ups with venture capitalists. 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure, Apple is trying to improve the substance of its  
computers as well. 
</P>
<P>
	At the MacWorld show here on Tuesday, Apple lowered the price of  
the iMac by $100 to $1,200 and boosted its processing power and 
storage capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple also introduced new versions of its G3 computer line for  
professionals that cost less, sport more power and include a 
uniquely designed lever that allows users to easily open up the 
computer case to add memory or other features. 
</P>
<P>
	And Apple began selling ``server'' software that enables  
businesses and schools to link Macs into a network of computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves, along with the new color choices, could attract new  
users and help Apple expand a profitable niche among design 
professionals and schools and colleges. 
</P>
<P>
	For now at least, Apple appears to be on a roll. And the iMac,  
also available in tangerine-orange, lime-green and grape-purple, is 
clearly part of the story. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Jobs, Apple's interim chief executive, said Apple expected  
to report its fifth consecutive profitable quarter next Wednesday, 
furthering its recent recovery from two years of losses. He would 
not give the size of the profit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that people want to collect all five'' colors, Jobs  
joked in his keynote speech, to the applause and whoops of 
thousands of Apple Macintosh fans at the show. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple has sold 800,000 iMacs since it was introduced on Aug. 15,  
making it the No. 1-selling PC at retail last November. That's 
still a fraction of the estimated 35 million to 40 million PCs sold

<HEADLINE> Vols' Hometown Giddy Over Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee's hometown embraced the  
Volunteers' national championship football team with a mad rush for 
souvenirs and a day-after desire to capture the moment forever. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this was the year of destiny, fate, call it whatever  
you want to,'' Will Kirkpatrick said. ``I think UT was destined to 
make it where they did this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A small electronic sign behind the counter of the downtown Post  
Office flashed the message in orange pulses: ``A Perfect Season ... 
How 'Bout Them ... Vols.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Volunteers won the national championship and completed a  
13-0 season Monday night with a 23-16 victory over Florida State in 
the Fiesta Bowl. It was the Vols' first national football title 
since 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoxville sports bars were packed with boisterous,  
cigar-smoking, high-fiving fans Monday night. The city's embrace 
was more low-key Tuesday morning as commemorative ball caps 
appeared on the heads of sober downtown workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The university's official party returned from Tempe, Ariz.,  
Tuesday afternoon. But the players went their separate ways with 
their families and coach Phillip Fulmer stopped in Knoxville only 
long enough to hop on another plane for a recruiting trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an exciting time for all of Tennessee football,'' he  
said at the airport. ``Our kids have had a phenomenal season. We're 
really proud to be a part of history by being the first unified 
champion, and we are very appreciative of the unbelievable support 
all season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An official celebration was being planned after students return  
from winter break next week. Plans for a celebration Jan. 16 might 
be scrapped because it's the same day as Gov. Don Sundquist's 
inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are all these conflicts,'' deputy mayor Gene Patterson  
said, noting it also falls on the weekend before the Martin Luther 
King Jr. holiday. ``But this only happens about once every 
half-century, so we can't wait until the next one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Mayor Victor Ashe is proposing to rename Stadium  
Drive on the UT campus in front of Neyland Stadium to Phillip 
Fulmer Way. 
</P>
<P>
	Tostitos, sponsor of the Fiesta Bowl, flooded grocery stores  
that routinely play Vols games over their public address systems 
with commemorative bags of chips. The Make-A-Wish Foundation hoped 
to raise $25,000 through sales of 5,000 commemorative Tennessee 
footballs. 
</P>
<P>
	And retailers with Tennessee goods expected to sell millions of  
dollars in merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of fans rushed the Sport Seasons store in an otherwise  
closed West Town Mall minutes after the game ended shortly before 
midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got here when it was 23-9 and as soon as I got in the door,  
within two minutes, there were two guys standing outside,'' store 
manager Joey Smith said. ``And from then on it (the merchandise) 
started to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His initial inventory was gone in a half-hour, but Smith  
promised customers more was on the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest with you, we didn't realize there would be this  
kind of response,'' he said. ``But we are glad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alan McCarter of Seymour bought an armful of Tennessee shirts  
and caps. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was more or less whatever you could get your hands on, and  
then see if you wanted it or not,'' McCarter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Souvenir makers Bacon &AMP; Co. of Knoxville and New Hampshire-based  
Pro Player cranked up their printing operations as soon as the game 
was in hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came in at about midnight and I would say we will be here  
until midnight tonight,'' Bacon &AMP; Co. spokesman Jed Dance said. 
``Or maybe around the clock again, if we can stand up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Tennessee Fever, another Vols souvenir store, spokesman John  
Weaver said fans were waiting when he opened at 7:30 a.m. and half 
of the 600 championship items he stocked were sold by midday. 
</P>
<P>
	What's selling? ``Hats, shirts, anything that says `Tennessee  
national champions,''' he said. And more is on the way. ``License 
plates, trash cans, flags, ties, anything you can put an orange `T' 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knoxville News-Sentinel was expecting strong demand for its  
Tuesday edition so it printed 215,000 copies instead of the normal 
125,000. The front page featured the headline ``CHAMPIONS!'' 
printed in orange. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are selling them as fast as we can print them,'' said  
publisher Bruce Hartmann.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Construction Spending Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Low interest rates and unseasonable warmth  
boosted U.S. construction spending in November, marking the sixth 
consecutive increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the strength came in housing. Commercial construction --  
particularly at factories -- is starting to show the impact of 
overseas economic turmoil and tighter lending standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (credit) situation has improved significantly since early  
October, but credit is still not as readily available as it was 
early in 1998,'' said economist Lynn Reaser of NationsBank Corp. in 
Jacksonville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, spending advanced 0.9 percent from the month before to  
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $677.8 billion in November, 
the Commerce Department said Tuesday. It is the first time the 
volatile series has posted six consecutive gains since 1993. It was 
the largest monthly increase since July. 
</P>
<P>
	Low interest rates have fueled robust construction, particularly  
of new homes. Overall construction spending in November was 8.8 
percent higher than a year earlier and residential spending was up 
15.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	However commercial spending in November edged down 0.1 percent  
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $174.6 billion, the first 
decline in four months. Sizable gains in spending on offices and 
retail stores did not quite offset big drops for hotels and motels 
and factories. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of big gains earlier in the year, hotel and motel  
spending still was up 20.6 percent from November 1997. But 
industrial construction was 6.3 percent lower than a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Much of that drop reflects cutbacks in construction of  
semiconductor plants,'' said economist Mark Vitner of First Union 
Corp. in Charlotte, N.C. ``But with much of the factory sector 
currently awash in excess capacity, industrial construction will 
likely continue to weaken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spending on housing in November jumped 1.2 percent, propelled by  
a 1.8 percent advance in single-family homes. However, apartment 
construction edged down 0.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Increases for schools and streets and highways helped push  
government spending up by 2.1 percent in November, almost making up 
for a 2.7 percent decline in October. From a year earlier, 
government spending was up just 0.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking forward, Reaser said it will be difficult for housing  
and commercial construction to post additional large gains, but 
state and local governments awash in tax revenue produced by robust 
economic growth during 1998 probably will pick up their pace of 
spending.

<HEADLINE> Marino, Elway Meeting May Be Last </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Elway &AMP; Marino Show is back for the second  
time in three weeks. And this time, it's for a spot in the AFC 
Championship Game. 
</P>
<P>
	In their first 15 years in the league, the NFL's most prolific  
quarterbacks had played against each other only once until this 
season. Now, Dan Marino and John Elway face off just 19 days after 
the Dolphins beat the Broncos in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Their meeting Saturday in the AFC divisional playoff game  
figures to be their last. Elway is expected to retire after this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is kind of odd that we went all those years without playing  
a regular-season game,'' Marino said on Tuesday. ``Now it's been -- 
what? -- three weeks, and we're going to play them again. That's 
just the way things work out sometimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until the recent Monday night encounter, Marino and Elway,  
co-valedictorians of the Quarterback Class of 1983, had squared off 
only in 1985, when the Dolphins beat the Broncos 30-26 at Mile 
High. 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves Marino with a 2-0 record in games against Elway. He  
has clearly outplayed Elway in both games, throwing for 745 yards 
and seven touchdowns with one interception compared to Elway's 401 
yards, no touchdowns and three interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino and Elway are the only quarterbacks in NFL history to  
pass for 50,000 yards. Marino has 58,913 and Elway 51,475, and 
Marino leads his counterpart in nearly every other statistical 
category. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Elway has an NFL-record 148 victories as a starter to  
Marino's 142. And, in the most coveted category of all, Elway has 
one Super Bowl ring, which he captured last January, and Marino is 
ringless. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a sense that Marino would chuck it all for one ring.  
</P>
<P>
	Elway was the sentimental favorite of the fans and many players  
to win a ring last season. Is it Marino's turn? 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't necessarily feel that way,'' Marino said. ``If I'm  
lucky enough to get close enough to that, and hopefully that's the 
case, it will be great. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I'm thinking about going to Denver and winning this  
game and moving on. If it comes up and that's the case, that would 
be outstanding. I would relish the chance to have that 
opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino watched in admiration -- and a little bit of envy -- when  
Elway and the Broncos beat Green Bay 31-24 last Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was happy for him,'' Marino said, ``because he had a chance  
and he worked so hard his whole career and it was exciting to 
see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked on Tuesday if he would feel sorry for Marino if the  
Broncos, favored by 13 points, prevail this weekend, Elway said 
with a laugh, ``No, because I know that he's got 10 years left. 
Actually, he said he was going to play two or three more years, so 
he'll get his shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, 38, who has said this is his last season, said Marino's  
desire to stay in the game ``has a lot to do with having that Super 
Bowl ring. Maybe he would think differently about it if he had that 
ring. I'd like to talk to him about it. I know how I feel 
physically. Maybe he feels a heck of a lot better than I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two quarterbacks, good friends off the field, have a mutual  
admiration society. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan is so competitive and he's a winner,'' Elway said. ``When  
you look back at what he's done statistically throughout the years 
and being able to do it consistently over a long period, to me 
that's greatness. His quick release is probably the thing that 
stands out most.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino said he respected Elway's toughness and ``his ability to  
throw any pass on the field at any time. The thing that he does so 
great is he can create on his own by moving out of the pocket and 
making plays downfield and also running it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for his future, Marino, 37, said he was ``not putting any  
timetable on it. I'd like to continue to play. I'm just going to 
enjoy what I'm doing right now, and whatever the future brings, it 
brings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Would he walk away if he wins a Super Bowl? ``I'm not sure.  
That's something that you don't even think about.''

<HEADLINE> 'Patch Adams' Tops Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- On a weekend when Midwest storms kept people  
away from the movies, Universal Studios got a final holiday gift 
from ``Patch Adams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Robin Williams film about a doctor who relies on comedy as  
part of his cures was the top film at North American theaters for 
the second consecutive weekend, according to industry figures 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Though critically panned, ``Patch Adams'' grossed $19.1 million  
to give struggling Universal a much-needed boost. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the snowbound box office was down about 5 percent from  
the same weekend last year. Still, a number of 1998 movies 
continued to do strong business in wide release, while such Oscar 
entries as ``Shakespeare in Love,'' ``Affliction,'' ``Waking Ned 
Devine'' and ``The Thin Red Line'' attracted large crowds on fewer 
screens. 
</P>
<P>
	The dying mother drama ``Stepmom,'' with Susan Sarandon and  
Julia Roberts, finished second with $14.6 million, ahead of the 
romantic comedy ``You've Got Mail'' with $14.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Prince of Egypt'' was fourth with $11.2 million while  
another animated feature, ``A Bug's Life,'' was fifth with $8.8 
million, losing only 16 percent of its audience in the seventh 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love,'' riding a wave of critical raves and  
Golden Globe nominations, was shaping up to be a sleeper hit, 
collecting $3.2 million on just 299 screens to bring its total to 
$9.4 million.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Ashcroft Won't Seek Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri, who spent a  
year laying the groundwork for a White House bid backed by social 
conservative leaders, announced today that he will not seek the 
presidency but will focus on his Senate duties instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing a tough re-elect contest in 2000, Ashcroft said he  
determined a presidential race would ``substantially impair my 
ability'' to serve well in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Leadership is the business of making choices, and given these  
circumstances I come here to say today that I choose serving 
Missouri in the United States Senate,'' he told supporters in his 
hometown of Springfield, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft did not formally announce his intentions to seek  
re-election, but advisers said the likelihood of a tough challenge 
from Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan was a driving force behind his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's junior senator had been the early choice of several  
social conservative leaders hoping to coalesce around one 
candidate. Ashcroft's decision left them surprised and 
disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the conservative mantle is now up for grabs,'' said  
Michael Farris, president of the Home School Legal Defense 
Associations in Purcellville, Va. ``The social conservative 
movement had gravitated toward Ashcroft and there was not an easy 
second choice. There's a lot of head scratching about what to do 
next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A number of us had put ourselves on the line for him and we  
had hoped he would run,'' said Paul Weyrich, president of the Free 
Congress Foundation. ``In the end, he really didn't have the fire 
in his belly to make it through the presidential campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft's decision could bolster the prospects of other  
Republicans courting social conservatives, including former Vice 
President Dan Quayle, millionaire publisher Steve Forbes and 
religious activist Gary Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
	Weyrich and other activists criticized Ashcroft last month for  
trying to moderate the tone of his rhetoric to help appeal to a 
broader audience. He was squeezed by competing wings of the party, 
trying to court social conservatives who dominate presidential 
primaries while testing his ability to form a more moderate general 
election coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	Some advisers said Ashcroft realized he couldn't appease the  
party's right wing while doing what it takes to win a general 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft also was said to be concerned that running for  
president would put his seat in jeopardy in 2000, when Republicans 
are at risk of losing control of the Senate. There also were 
questions about whether he could raise enough money, a doubt 
plaguing several potential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	His announcement was the second surprise in two days from the  
field of potential presidential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole, a Cabinet member in two GOP administrations and  
wife of the 1996 Republican presidential nominee, Bob Dole, said 
Monday she will leave her job as president of the American Red 
Cross to pursue a potential White House bid of her own. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may be another way for me to serve our country,'' she  
said at the organization's historic headquarters two blocks from 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire formed a presidential campaign  
committee Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Advisers said former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, a failed  
1996 presidential candidate, plans to form his committee Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole served as transportation secretary for President  
Reagan and labor secretary for President Bush. She is credited with 
stabilizing the Red Cross, which was under a cloud of scrutiny when 
she took over eight years ago. The safety of its blood supply, once 
the focus of government attention, is no longer in question. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Red Cross has been a glorious mission, but I believe there  
may be other duties yet to fulfill,'' she told Red Cross employees. 
Afterward, Mrs. Dole said she wanted to leave the nonpartisan Red 
Cross before actively considering a presidential campaign, but said 
she soon would begin talking to activists, potential donors and 
perhaps travel to key presidential states. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm giving it serious consideration,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole traveled aboard her own plane, kept her own schedule  
and was a nearly flawless surrogate for her husband in 1996. Her 
walk-through-the-audience performance at the Republican National 
Convention in San Diego won widespread praise. 
</P>
<P>
	She is trusted by many conservative activists and could help  
Republicans attract female voters, GOP analysts say. Polls 
consistently show Mrs. Dole earning the support of more than 10 
percent of GOP voters in several surveys.

<HEADLINE>  Apple's iMac Sports Four New Colors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The iMac personal computer, which some say  
helped save Apple Computer Inc.'s life, looks more like a Lifesaver 
than even before. Literally. 
</P>
<P>
	The unusual-looking translucent desktop now comes in five bright  
colors, from strawberry red to original teal, that are sure to 
further stand out on store shelves from traditional beige machines. 
</P>
<P>
	But are the popular new iMacs a one-product wonder, or can they  
help the company take a major bite again out of the market soundly 
controlled by Windows-based desktop machines? 
</P>
<P>
	With the iMac less than five months old, this year may prove  
crucial in deciding that question. As former Apple chief evangelist 
Guy Kawasaki notes, design alone can't help Apple sustain the 1980s 
revolution Apple spurred by simplifying the way computers interact 
with people. 
</P>
<P>
	``The iMac is an amazing marketing-industrial design type  
success,'' said Kawasaki, who had the important Apple job of 
prodding developers to write new software programs for the Mac. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is, What is the revolution? You can only design  
and redesign Apple so much,'' Kawasaki said in an interview this 
week at his Silicon Valley office, where he runs a business that 
helps match start-ups with venture capitalists. 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure, Apple is trying to improve the substance of its  
computers as well. 
</P>
<P>
	At the MacWorld show here on Tuesday, Apple lowered the price of  
the iMac by $100 to $1,200 and boosted its processing power and 
storage capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple also introduced new versions of its G3 computer line for  
professionals that cost less, sport more power and include a 
uniquely designed lever that allows users to easily open up the 
computer case to add memory or other features. 
</P>
<P>
	And Apple began selling ``server'' software that enables  
businesses and schools to link Macs into a network of computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves, along with the new color choices, could attract new  
users and help Apple expand a profitable niche among design 
professionals and schools and colleges. 
</P>
<P>
	For now at least, Apple appears to be on a roll. And the iMac,  
also available in tangerine-orange, lime-green and grape-purple, is 
clearly part of the story. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Jobs, Apple's interim chief executive, said Apple expected  
to report its fifth consecutive profitable quarter next Wednesday, 
furthering its recent recovery from two years of losses. He would 
not give the size of the profit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that people want to collect all five'' colors, Jobs  
joked in his keynote speech, to the applause and whoops of 
thousands of Apple Macintosh fans at the show. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple has sold 800,000 iMacs since it was introduced on Aug. 15,  
making it the No. 1-selling PC at retail last November. That's 
still a fraction of the estimated 35 million to 40 million PCs sold 
worldwide over the same period. But Apple said 45 percent of iMac 
buyers were new Mac users, including first-time computer buyers and 
some former Windows users. 
</P>
<P>
	That success helped buoy the spirits of MacWorld attendees, who  
were too busy cheering Jobs' keynote speech to debate Apple's 
long-term prospects in an industry dominated by Windows machines. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a Mac user, it's encouraging to have Steve Jobs at the  
helm. It's his baby and he's not going to let it suffer,'' said 
Norm Daniels, who creates promotional videos for Home Lake 
Christian Camps, a youth camp in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Some observers worried that stores may have a tough time  
stocking all the new iMac colors, but Jobs said in an interview 
after the keynote speech that wasn't a concern. 
</P>
<P>
	``We chose colors that we thought reflected the spirit of the  
product,'' Jobs said.

<HEADLINE> Nuns Pray Over Pope's Mo. Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Local nuns have been asked to pray for two  
things this month: the health of John Paul II and nice weather 
during the pope's visit. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the weather isn't cooperating.  
</P>
<P>
	The pope is visiting town Jan. 26-27. At that time last year, it  
was about 60 degrees in St. Louis. But a winter storm last week 
dumped 8 inches of snow and sleet. By Tuesday, things were still a 
mess amid bitter cold. 
</P>
<P>
	Most schools were closed, with all but main roads nearly  
impassable. Slippery spots on highways continued to cause wrecks 
and snarl traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Another winter storm just before or during the two-day visit  
would worsen expected traffic problems and could even prevent the 
plane carrying the pope from landing at Lambert Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are two things we don't know,'' police Chief Ron  
Henderson said. ``We don't know how many people are going to show 
up, and we don't know the weather.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was on Monsignor Richard Stika's mind last year. He has  
asked about 150 contemplative nuns, who spend virtually their 
entire day in prayer, to pitch in. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked them to pray for two intentions,'' the papal visit  
coordinator said Tuesday. ``The first was for the pope's health, 
and the second was for good weather so when he and his people come 
to St. Louis, it's a joyful visit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With weather-related troubles still all around, Stika hopes the  
prayers are answered.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Police Shooting Protested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) -- The FBI has taken the first step toward  
an investigation into whether Los Angeles police violated the civil 
rights of a 19-year-old woman who was shot to death as she sat in 
her disabled car with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los  
Angeles, said the FBI's task will be to determine whether a full 
investigation is warranted. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrozek's statement came Monday as 300 people marched peacefully  
on police headquarters to protest the Dec. 28 shooting of Tyisha 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe that, if Tyisha Miller would have been a  
little white girl, she would have been murdered,'' said Billy 
Mohammad, a Muslim leader from neighboring Moreno Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	A preliminary coroner's report said the black teen-ager was shot  
12 times, dying from head and chest wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers called to the scene by relatives at about 2 a.m. said  
they found her sitting in the car at a gas station parking lot, a 
gun in her lap. The car had a flat tire, its doors were locked, the 
windows were rolled up and the engine was running. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said she didn't respond until officers broke a window to  
get her gun. She was shot when she grabbed the weapon, according to 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Results of toxicology tests on Ms. Miller are expected within  
two weeks, Mrozek said. Two outside laboratories will also test 
samples from Ms. Miller's hand and a gun found at the scene to 
determine if she fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives, who filed a lawsuit Monday demanding a federal  
investigation, claim she was unconscious when she was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want the names of the police officers,'' said Bernell  
Butler, Ms. Miller's uncle. ``What are they trying to hide? We want 
to see their urinalysis. We want to see their background checks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four officers -- three white and one Hispanic -- and a white  
sergeant who were at the scene have been placed on paid leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Jerry Carroll met with black community leaders  
after the shooting and promised a full investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Riverside is about 60 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Government Wrapping Up Microsoft Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is close to wrapping up its  
antitrust case against Microsoft, preparing to call as its final 
witness an economist who believes the computer software giant 
represents a ``predatory'' monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin Fisher, an economics professor at the Massachusetts  
Institute of Technology, is the government's last announced witness 
in its lengthy antitrust case against Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's lawyers were expected to begin questioning Fisher  
as early as today. Microsoft will begin calling its witnesses -- 
starting with MIT economist Richard Schmalansee -- next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Among its allegations, the government charges that Microsoft  
illegally included its own Internet browsing software within its 
Windows as part of a campaign to ``crush'' rival Netscape 
Communications Corp., which makes competing browser software that 
isn't shipped with Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher, in written testimony, called Microsoft's bundling of its  
Internet software a ``predatory anti-competitive act.'' He also 
told the judge that Microsoft's high market share -- in excess of 80 
percent -- indicates that the company wields monopoly power. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher said Microsoft, using its influence, discouraged Internet  
providers from distributing Netscape's software, and he repeated 
claims that Microsoft sought to stifle emerging rival technologies 
from Intel Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Microsoft is permitted to use its existing monopoly power  
over PC operating systems to monopolize the market for Internet 
browsers -- and thereby to put itself in the position to control and 
ultimately exact a monopoly toll for efficient access to the 
Internet -- the economic costs to consumers and the economy will 
again be substantial,'' Fisher wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft criticized Fisher's testimony as ``littered with  
errors, third-hand information supplied by the DOJ (Department of 
Justice) and excerpts from out-of-context e-mail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft ``cannot charge a monopoly price because it faces  
competition from rival operating systems, potential market 
entrants, its own installed base and pirated software,'' the 
company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher testified on behalf of IBM Corp. during its years-long  
antitrust fight against the Justice Department, when he worked with 
lawyer David Boies, now leading the government's case. The 
department ultimately dropped the IBM case. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft sought to use Fisher's own words against him, quoting  
his 1983 book about IBM when he wrote: ``Conduct that brings 
profitable higher sales cannot be anti-competitive regardless of 
how uncomfortable it makes competitors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Professor Fisher's testimony would give readers of his 1983  
book whiplash,'' Microsoft said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like other witnesses, Fisher submitted his written testimony in  
advance at the request of U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department is under court orders to release  
testimony one day before each witness takes the stand. It announced 
late Monday it was waiting until today to make Fisher's testimony 
public, but Microsoft's point-by-point rebuttal suggested a general 
outline and contained excerpts of the testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision marked the second time during the trial the  
government had failed to publicly release testimony as it was 
obligated to do under court rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, William Harris, chief executive officer for  
Intuit Inc., which makes the popular Quicken personal finance 
software, defended his suggestion that Microsoft be prevented from 
using Windows to favor its own software products. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris asserted that Microsoft holds unparalleled influence in  
the high-tech industry because Windows, which functions as the 
central nervous system for most computers, is an ``essential 
service'' for which ``there is no effective substitute.''

<HEADLINE> Quality of Local TV News Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Local television news doesn't necessarily need  
to emphasize blood and guts crime reporting to land viewers, a new 
study suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	Quality news broadcasts were more likely to succeed than fail in  
the ratings, according to the study released Monday. 
Tabloid-oriented broadcasts also do well, indicating that the 
stations that suffer are the ones confused about which direction to 
take. 
</P>
<P>
	The study ranked newscasts at 61 stations in 21 cities and was  
conducted by the Project for Excellence in Journalism, a group 
funded by the Pew Charitable Trusts and affiliated with the 
Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. 
</P>
<P>
	Its results should cause television news directors to question  
old ideas, including the axiom that ``if it bleeds, it leads'' 
local newscasts, said Tom Rosensteil, a former media critic and the 
project's director. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that they begin to question some of the conventional  
wisdom that is kicked around in local TV about flash, crime, 
brevity and infotainment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosensteil said TV news audiences are segmented, with some  
preferring serious broadcasts and others a tabloid approach. What 
they don't like is when stations try to have it both ways, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stations that succeeded with quality did more long stories,  
quoted more sources on stories and spoke to more average citizens, 
and also showed enterprise by doing more than just reacting to 
breaking news, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers also found a correlation between longer stories and  
rising ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It suggested that people's attention spans are not  
ever-shrinking,'' Rosensteil said. ``When you have a story that's 
really interesting, people want to hear it in depth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study found mixed results when it looked for quality, he  
said. Researchers were surprised at how many times some of the 
basics of journalism, like seeking both sides of a story, were 
overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Rosensteil said, more investigative reporting  
was being done than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Big-city broadcasts also tended to score lower in quality  
rankings than those in smaller cities, the study found. Rosensteil 
isn't sure whether that's because late-evening broadcasts tend to 
get higher ratings in the larger cities, and these try to pack more 
stories into a half hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Cochran, president of the Radio and Television News  
Directors Association, said she was heartened by the finding that 
quality can pay off in ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It suggests that if you're being challenged by a station that  
does more tabloid news, the answer is not to incorporate more 
tabloid into your broadcast, but to stick with the style of news 
that your audience prefers,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study gave ``A-plus'' ratings to five stations: WEHT and  
WEVV in Evansville, Ind.; KAKE in Wichita, Kan.; WLKY in 
Louisville, Ky.; and KARE in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven stations were given failing ratings: WABC in New York  
City; WGNX in Atlanta; KMOV in St. Louis; KIRO in Seattle; WCCO in 
Minneapolis; and two Pittsburgh stations, WPXI and WTAE.

<HEADLINE> Britain Launches Princess Di Coin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The Royal Mint introduced a coin today in memory  
of the late Princess Diana. 
</P>
<P>
	The coin features a portrait of Diana in profile on one side,  
and the standard image of Queen Elizabeth II on the other. It has a 
value of 5 pounds, or about $8. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first official memorial organized by the Diana,  
Princess of Wales Memorial Committee. The group -- formed after the 
princess' 1997 death in a Paris car crash -- had asked for 
suggestions on how best to remember the princess, and received more 
than 10,000 responses, said Chancellor Gordon Brown, the committee 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	A commemorative coin was one of the most popular ideas.  
</P>
<P>
	Buyers can purchase the coin, which is legal tender, in a  
special commemorative folder for $16. Gold and silver versions of 
the coins will be available from April. The coins will also be sold 
at face value by banks and post offices after July 1, which was 
Diana's birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials expect more than 10 million to be sold worldwide,  
mostly as keepsakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am sure that this official commemorative coin will be  
treasured by the people of Great Britain,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Proceeds will go towards funding other memorials to the  
princess. Those include creating nursing teams for terminally ill 
children, dubbed Diana teams, and developing a children's 
playground near Diana's former Kensington Palace home in London.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Bush Takes Office in Florida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Republican Jeb Bush was sworn in as  
governor Tuesday, calling on citizens to help create a more 
compassionate approach to government. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is your journey as well as mine,'' Bush said. ``I ask you  
join with me to make Florida not only a magnificent engine of 
commerce ... it also should be a better neighborhood, a nicer 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should be known for the compassion of our dreams as much as  
their grandeur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, 45, took the oath of office in the nation's fourth largest  
state after an opening prayer by evangelist Billy Graham. 
</P>
<P>
	About 5,000 people shivered in morning temperatures of 23  
degrees during the outdoor ceremony at the Old Capitol building. 
Joining Bush was his wife, Columba, their three children, brother 
George W. Bush, who won re-election as Texas governor, and George 
and Barbara Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``Feel good,'' the former president said. ``Never dreamed it  
would be this exciting for a family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George W. Bush, two weeks away from his own inauguration and  
mulling a run for the presidency, said, ``This is a great day for 
mother and dad. This is a testament to what wonderful parents they 
are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeb Bush defeated outgoing Gov. Buddy MacKay, a Democrat who  
became governor on Dec. 13 following the unexpected death of Gov. 
Lawton Chiles. Chiles was prevented from running for re-election 
due to term limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush is just the third Republican to serve as governor this  
century. But unlike his GOP predecessors, he will enjoy a 
Republican-controlled Legislature -- the first time this century 
that the GOP controls the legislative and executive branches of 
government.

<HEADLINE> Lott Seeks Guidelines on Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the new, 106th Congress set to convene in  
a day, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott is struggling to craft 
guidelines for President Clinton's historic impeachment trial that 
can satisfy Democrats as well as Republicans divided among 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott slipped out of the Capitol without speaking to waiting  
reporters on Monday night, after a day in which the GOP rank and 
file heaped fresh criticism on a bipartisan proposal for truncated 
proceeding that would result in a test vote in less than a week's 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I simply believe we must accept our responsibility to conduct  
the impeachment trial, followed by a vote to remove or retain the 
president,'' GOP freshman Sen. Rod Grams of Minnesota told Lott in 
a letter. He cautioned against a proposal to ``shortcut the 
procedure'' envisioned in the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.,  
said today a majority of senators want to expedite the proceeding 
against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The longer this drags out, the more acrimonious, the more  
political and the less helpful it'll be,'' he said on NBC's 
``Today.'' ``We ought to be looking for solutions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the criticism of a quick solution has come from  
conservatives, but Sen. Arlen Specter, a moderate Republican 
recently elected to his fourth term, also expressed strong 
misgivings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is very difficult to conduct a trial if you don't  
have witnesses,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Many if not all Senate Democrats back the proposal for a test  
vote after a brief presentation of the evidence against the 
president, and the White House served notice during the day that it 
was preparing a hard-nosed defense in the event of a full-blown 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Advisers familiar with the developing defense strategy said  
lawyers are working on trial motions concerning evidence and an 
opening presentation that would sharply attack the House 
conclusions and the evidence from Independent Counsel Kenneth 
Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening presentation ``would be far more extensive and  
sharper in tone and content'' than the one Clinton's lawyers made 
before the House Judiciary Committee in arguing the evidence didn't 
warrant impeachment, said one lawyer who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved two articles of impeachment on Dec. 19,  
accusing Clinton of perjury and obstruction of justice in 
connection with an attempt to conceal his sexual relationship with 
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	That set the stage for a Senate trial, and the rank and file of  
both parties will caucus separately on Wednesday before the new 
Congress is sworn in in an effort to agree on a procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	The bipartisan plan was advanced last week by Sens. Slade  
Gorton, R-Wash., and Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	It proposes that after House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde  
presented evidence for one day, the White House would have a day 
for rebuttal followed by another day of speeches by lawmakers. Then 
the Senate would take a quick vote to determine whether a 
full-blown trial should proceed. Unless two-thirds of the Senate 
voted in favor of such proceedings, the lawmakers then would be 
free to turn to censuring Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	In a news conference in his home state of Washington on Monday,  
Gorton said the plan he and Lieberman developed would proceed only 
if a majority of each party supported it. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats apparently are in favor, and his ``best guess'' is  
that a majority of the Senate agrees, but ``Senator Lott will 
propose the plan, I believe, only if a majority of Republicans 
favor it,'' Gorton said. 
</P>
<P>
	While last month's House vote largely wrapped up the House's  
role in the first presidential impeachment since 1868, officials 
said Monday that lawmakers must vote again on Wednesday -- shortly 
after Congress convenes -- to authorize key lawmakers to formally 
lay out the case against Clinton at any Senate trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Republican sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said GOP vote counters were confident such a proposal would pass, 
despite a reduced Republican majority in the 106th Congress. 
Republicans hold a six-seat margin, an edge that is reduced by one 
by the absence of Newt Gingrich, the former speaker who is retiring 
rather than taking the oath of office for his new term from Georgia 
on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	While the articles of impeachment themselves survive the  
transition to the new Congress, experts say a repeat vote is 
necessary for Hyde and other so-called managers to perform their 
function as prosecutors once the new Congress takes office. 
</P>
<P>
	That requirement also presents Democrats with a fresh  
opportunity to affect the course of an impeachment they have sought 
to thwart. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, listed  
several options, including a new attempt to place the House on 
record in favor of censure, a plan to try and limit the 
jurisdiction of the House's prosecutors and a plan to try to add 
Democrats to the team of prosecutors.

<HEADLINE> Police Arrest Suspected Nev. Sniper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- A man pulled over for having a burned-out  
light on his license plate was arrested and accused of being the 
sniper who earlier in the day opened fire with a rifle from the 
rocks overlooking Interstate 80. 
</P>
<P>
	At least six vehicles were hit by the gunfire Monday morning on  
the outskirts of Reno. One man was shot in the chest and seriously 
wounded but was able to drive to a fire station a few miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff Richard Kirkland said the suspect, Christopher Lee  
Merritt, 20, of Mankato, Minn., was a ``goofball'' who shot at cars 
in hopes of robbing the drivers after they crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was frustrated because people would drive on a ways. We're  
not talking about a rocket ship commander,'' Kirkland said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rampage shut down a 10-mile stretch of the interstate for  
five hours and forced schoolchildren to stay inside. Two people 
were hurt by flying glass, and in two other cases, bullets flew 
between the front seats, sheriff's Sgt. Bob Towery said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday night in Las Vegas, a Highway Patrol trooper and a  
city police officer on a drug patrol pulled Merritt over when they 
spotted the burned-out light on his truck. 
</P>
<P>
	A check showed the truck had been stolen in Missouri, and the  
officers found a rifle, a shotgun and a large number of rounds, 
Kirkland said. Merritt then ``made some statements that 
incriminated himself in the shooting,'' the sheriff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Merritt was returned to Reno Tuesday and booked on eight counts  
of attempted murder, six counts of shooting a firearm at an 
occupied vehicle, five counts of assault with a deadly weapon and 
three counts of battery with a deadly weapon. He was being held 
without bail in the Washoe County jail. 
</P>
<P>
	``I overheard some talk radio show the other night lambasting  
law enforcement for stopping people for having lights out on their 
license plates,'' Kirkland said. ``So there.''

<HEADLINE> Ryan Overwhelmingly Elected to Hall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALVIN, Texas (AP) -- Nolan Ryan might have been the only man in  
America wondering Tuesday morning whether he'd be elected to the 
Baseball Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first thought was, `What if I don't get that phone call?''  
Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
	His worries couldn't have been more unfounded.  
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's greatest power pitcher was named on 491 of the 497  
ballots cast by 10-year members of the Baseball Writers' 
Association of America. With one more vote, he would've broken the 
record percentage of his former New York Mets teammate Tom Seaver. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly an honor that I was thought of on that level,''  
Ryan said. ``Tom was obviously one of the best pitchers I ever saw 
throw the baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also elected Tuesday were George Brett and Robin Yount. It's the  
first time three rookie candidates have been elected since the 
inaugural class of 1936. 
</P>
<P>
	With the same aplomb he showed while throwing seven no-hitters,  
shattering the strikeout record at 5,714 and surpassing the 
300-victory plateau, Ryan said induction into the Hall is a dream 
come true. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no idea whether I had the ability or the talent to make  
the big leagues, and then when I made the big leagues, I wasn't 
sure whether I belonged there or not,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Alvin -- just south of Houston, where Ryan became baseball's  
first million-dollar man in 1980 when he signed with the Astros -- 
the 51-year-old pitcher-turned-businessman said the honor was all 
he could hope for. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really does kind of top off my career. I feel very  
fortunate,'' Ryan said. ``I feel like I had the opportunity to live 
the childhood dream of so many American boys growing up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a news conference at the Nolan Ryan Center on the campus of  
Alvin Community College, Gov. George W. Bush introduced Ryan to a 
crowd of reporters and well-wishers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is as Texan as Texan gets,'' said Bush, who owned part of  
the Rangers during Ryan's tenure and in recent years appointed 
Ryan, an avid outdoorsman, to the state Parks and Wildlife 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who now oversees the Texas Rangers peace officers, offered  
to track down the sportswriters who did not vote for Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to be looking for those six writers who must never  
have seen him play,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	While naysayers cite his .526 career winning percentage  
(324-292) -- the lowest of any 300-game winner -- and his record 
2,795 walks, it's undisputed that Ryan contributed to the first 
real success each of his four franchises enjoyed: 
</P>
<P>
	--He earned a save in his only appearance in the 1969 World  
Series, which the Mets won in a stunning upset of the Baltimore 
Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	--His Angels made their first playoff appearance in his eighth  
and final season there. 
</P>
<P>
	--The next season, the Astros reached the playoffs for the first  
time with the Ryan Express on board. He helped them make it back in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ryan's signing with the Rangers rescued the franchise from  
anonymity, helped garner public support for The Ballpark in 
Arlington and laid the groundwork for their current success. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any question the organization crossed  
the threshold when it signed Nolan Ryan,'' team president Tom 
Schieffer said. ``When he performed to the level he did, he 
captured the imagination of the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan will be the sixth former Astro in the Hall of Fame and the  
fifth former Ranger; none of the previous wore the hat of a Texas 
team on their plaque. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan picked the Rangers because he felt his five years there put  
him over the top. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like those were very special years,'' said Ryan, who  
arguably accomplished more in Anaheim and Houston, but left both 
teams after neither made a serious attempt to re-sign him. 
</P>
<P>
	Rangers general manager Doug Melvin noted that the presence of  
virtually the entire Astros front office -- none of whom were 
involved in his 1988 departure -- was testament to Ryan's class. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great compliment to him that such a number of people  
are so proud of him, regardless of what hat he's wearing,'' Melvin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan noted that it was as a Ranger that he won his 300th game,  
struck out his 5,000th batter and tossed his sixth and seventh 
no-hitters. Though he owns a minor-league team in the Astros 
system, he remains on a personal services contract with Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked repeatedly if this is the ultimate accomplishment after a  
27-year career jammed with records and honors, Ryan said he wasn't 
quite sure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'll know after going through the induction ceremony  
in July,'' Ryan said.

<HEADLINE> FSU Sloppiness Leads To Defeat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Florida State's motto for its drive to the  
national championship game was ``Discipline to the Desert.'' It 
didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
	In a very undisciplined performance, the Seminoles repeatedly  
made mistakes with bone-headed penalties and costly turnovers in 
their 23-16 loss to Tennessee in the Fiesta Bowl on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Those errors included two interceptions, one of which was  
returned for a touchdown, and 110 penalty yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say if you keep making the same mistakes you are  
stupid,'' offensive guard Jason Whitaker said. ``I guess we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bobby Bowden said the Seminoles seemed to be hurt by the  
long layover since they ended their regular season on Nov. 21. 
Tennessee had last played on Dec. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our discipline wasn't very good,'' Bowden said. ``We were a  
very, very rusty football team, but they were, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles started a third-string quarterback, Marcus Outzen,  
due to injuries that sidelined Dan Kendra and Chris Weinke. 
</P>
<P>
	Outzen said he did all he could.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I failed to win the game,'' he said. ``I think I  
did some good things. Of course, I did some bad things. I don't 
think the game was on my shoulders. The team didn't win this game. 
In every aspect of the game our team made mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't all mistakes. Tennessee shut down Florida State's most  
lethal weapon, All-American wide receiver Peter Warrick. He caught 
only one pass for seven yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``We planned to go to him more,'' Outzen said. ``They played a  
safety over him more. ... They had more people toward his side than 
the other side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick, however, had only single coverage when Volunteers  
cornerback Dwayne Goodrich intercepted Outzen's pass and returned 
it 54 yards for a touchdown in the second quarter to put Tennessee 
ahead 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Outzen said he expected Goodrich to fade back when Warrick ran a  
corner route, but instead he came up and caught the ball in front 
of Warrick. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't see the corner or I would have never thrown it out  
there,'' Outzen said. ``But usually when he runs an out route, that 
means the corner was backing up. I didn't see it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State's offensive line failed to block well enough to  
effectively run the ball, Outzen said. Tennessee also sacked Outzen 
four times. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wore our defense out not keeping their offense off the  
field,'' Whitaker said. ``I'll take the blame for the loss. The 
offensive line did not perform up to par.''

<HEADLINE> Abortion Clinic Sues Online Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Fla. (AP) -- An abortion clinic owner has filed a  
federal lawsuit against two online services she says provided 
anti-abortion activists with personal information about clinic 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit filed this week in Orlando names CompuServe and TML  
Information Services, which abortion foes allegedly used to get 
names and addresses from license plate numbers of cars driven to 
the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit seeks unspecified damages and an injunction to halt the  
activities of abortion opponents who watch the Aware Woman Center 
for Choice clinic every day from a house across the street. 
</P>
<P>
	``Heaven knows we've been intimidated many, many times,'' clinic  
owner Patricia Baird Windle said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-abortion activists have been able to find out who visits  
the clinic by writing down or videotaping the license plate numbers 
of vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the tag numbers, they find out car owners' names and  
addresses from the online services, which buy the information from 
state motor vehicle offices, according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinic visitors have received letters from anti-abortion  
activists. One doctor had a picture of himself in a car wreck sent 
to his patients. In another case, anti-abortion activists found the 
identity of a woman who had visited the clinic and followed her to 
a hospital and also trailed her in a department store, according to 
the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-abortion activist Meredith Raney, the lead defendant in the  
lawsuit, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	CompuServe spokeswoman Daphne Kent said she wasn't aware of the  
lawsuit and couldn't comment on it. The Columbus, Ohio-based 
company, recently purchased by America Online, has since stopped 
providing the information, said Roy Lucas, an attorney for the 
clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	TML Information Services no longer allows Raney to use its  
services, he said. There was no directory listing for the New 
York-based company.

<HEADLINE> Jets' Glenn Anxious About Ankle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Aaron Glenn wants to get back on the  
field in the worst way. What he doesn't want to is to be at his 
worst when he does return. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn, the New York Jets' Pro Bowl cornerback, has been  
sidelined with a sprained ankle since the first half of a victory 
over Seattle on Dec. 6. He resumed practicing last week on a 
limited basis and is hoping to go all-out this week in preparation 
for Sunday's playoff game with Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	But he isn't sure just how much he'll be able to do.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to be smart about it,'' the Jets' best cover  
cornerback said. ``I want to push it, but I don't want to set 
myself back. I have to be fair. Will I help the team or hurt the 
team by being out there. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be times when you get hurt and you've got to suck  
it up and understand if you can play with the pain. If you can, you 
go. Some guys can't do that. I hope I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So do his teammates, who know that the Jaguars have a dangerous  
receiving duo in Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell. All of the Jets 
expect Glenn to be at his best when he is ready. Anything less 
would be self-defeating against such a formidable opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aaron will see what he can and can't do and they'll judge it  
by that,'' fellow cornerback Otis Smith said. ``If he's back, 
that's a big boost for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn was hurt while intercepting a long pass intended for Joey  
Galloway in the second period. Earlier, Galloway burned Glenn for 
two long touchdowns, a rare occurrence for the five-year veteran 
defender and kick returner. 
</P>
<P>
	While Glenn has been sidelined, Ray Mickens performed superbly  
and the Jets won four straight. Still, coach Bill Parcells would 
prefer to have Glenn back in his normal slot so that Mickens could 
move back to the nickel back position. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's back, that gives us five guys who can cover on the  
corner,'' Parcells said of Glenn, Smith, Mickens, rookie Kevin 
Williams and Marcus Coleman. ``We need that against this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bye week helped Glenn's recovery, but he knows he'll be  
playing in some pain for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be tender a year from now,'' he said. ``It's fair to  
say there'll be some pain. There's nobody in this league who has an 
injury and is 100 percent when he comes back. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fair to say I want to play, but I will not do anything to  
jeopardize or hurt this team. I won't go out able to play only 
halfway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Safety Victor Green, who had the best year of his six-year  
career in a Jets secondary that far exceeded expectations, thinks 
Glenn not only will be on the Giants Stadium turf on Sunday, but 
will be a key contributor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting back our best cornerback, one of the best in the  
league,'' Green said. ``It's a big help from every one of us on 
defense. It's a big help for the team.''

<HEADLINE> World of Golf Is Changing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KAPALUA, Hawaii (AP) -- Phil Mickelson will defend his title this  
week in the Mercedes Championship on a course that used to be part 
of the exhibition tour. David Duval won four times last year, but 
he'll only defend in two of those tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	Welcome to the new world of golf.  
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 season begins Thursday at Kapalua Plantation, which  
snagged the Mercedes when La Costa Resort in southern California 
got the Andersen Consulting Match Play, one of the three World Golf 
Championship events. 
</P>
<P>
	It ends the first week of November in Spain with another WGC  
event, the Stroke Play Championship that features a limited field 
and what must seem like unlimited riches to the top players in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who once built their entire season around the four majors  
are now likely to build it around eight big events -- the majors, 
the three WGC tournaments and The Players Championship. And that 
doesn't include the always lucrative Tour Championship and the 
Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took a look at my schedule for next year,'' Tiger Woods said  
as the '98 season came to a close. ``It messes things up a little 
because some of the spots where I like to take my breaks ... I 
can't because I need to get ready for the bigger World Golf 
tournaments. It will be interesting to try to balance it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Here's a look at which tournaments are looking forward to the  
new year, and which tournaments can expect to lose some shine: 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *WINNERS   	
</P>
<P>
	--Nissan Open. The best of the West, Los Angeles still got  
overlooked by top players who took appearance money to play 
overseas, and by the international stars who waited until March to 
begin their build-up to the Masters. Now, more players will turn to 
Nissan to get ready for the Match Play Championship two weeks 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	--Players Championship. Same place in the schedule, same high  
stakes. But the arrival of the WGC events could result in scrutiny 
over their limited fields and reveal the TPC for what it is -- the 
toughest tournament to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are players in other majors who don't go there with the  
goal of winning,'' said Hal Sutton, alluding to amateurs and club 
pros. ``Everybody at the TPC wants to win. That what makes it the 
greatest of all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Canadian Open. The Toronto media complained last year when only  
two of the top 10 players on the money list showed up at Glen 
Abbey. This year it falls two weeks before the Ryder Cup and could 
become the final tuneup for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
	--Deposit Guaranty Classic. This used to be opposite the British  
Open and drew the weakest field of the year. Now it is opposite the 
Tour Championship. OK, so it won't get the top 30 players. But the 
Deposit gives players one more chance to finish in the top 40, 
which means an exemption to the Masters. And depending on the 
circumstances, it could be one last chance to get into the $5 
million field in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	 *LOSERS   	
</P>
<P>
	--Tucson. Duval got the first of his four victories at Tucson by  
holding off a late charge by Justin Leonard. Will either of them 
skip the Match Play Championship for Tucson? 
</P>
<P>
	--Doral. Greg Norman angered the West Coast tournaments a couple  
of years ago when he said that the Tour doesn't start until Doral, 
although he was right. Now, Doral could actually lose players -- it 
would be the third tournament in four weeks for many of them, with 
the string of Bay Hill, TPC and the Masters to follow. If nothing 
else, Doral loses its luster as the ``start'' of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	--FedEx St. Jude Classic. Past champions include Norman, Nick  
Price, John Cook and Fred Couples. But it goes from being two weeks 
after the British Open and two weeks before the PGA Championship to 
the week before the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Which is a better place to prepare for a major championship --  
the TPC at Southwind, where the winning score has been at least 
15-under since 1989, or Muirfield Village in the Memorial? 
</P>
<P>
	--Texas Open. Not exactly circled on the calendar to begin with,  
but this year it's opposite the Ryder Cup. The only attention it 
will get is if someone is watching college football on ESPN and 
forgets to change the channel. 
</P>
<P>
	--Tour Championship. This obviously will suffer because it no  
longer decides the money title or Vardon Trophy. PGA Tour 
commissioner Tim Finchem talks about having the season end with two 
big bangs, but only the Tour Championship makes more than a pop is 
if Americans decide that money isn't worth a long trip across the 
Atlantic.

<HEADLINE> Modem Maker Hayes Shuts Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Hayes Corp., a company that once dominated the  
personal-computer modem business, is shutting down after failing to 
find a buyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 250 employees were laid off Monday, leaving only a handful  
from a peak of 1,200. 
</P>
<P>
	The company sought protection from creditors in October, in its  
second trip to Bankruptcy Court in the 1990s, and attempted a 
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code as it 
talked to potential buyers. But its primary lender notified the 
company it wouldn't continue funding efforts to keep Hayes alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes Corp. owes some $42 million to creditors that include  
NationsCredit, Lucent Technologies and Rockwell Semiconductor 
Systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there hasn't been a formal bankruptcy liquidation, Ron  
Howard, Hayes' chief executive officer, told The Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution the company is closing down. 
</P>
<P>
	``The company is being liquidated,'' Howard said in a story  
published Tuesday. ``The company is no longer being operated as a 
going concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to reach the company for comment were unsuccessful.  
Calls were not immediately returned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the workers sent home without any severance Monday were  
tearful, although there was little surprise at the company's 
headquarters in Norcross, Ga. Many had already been circulating 
resumes since Hayes had began new layoffs after entering bankruptcy 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which had emerged from an earlier Chapter 11  
bankruptcy reorganization in 1996, had reported a net loss of $17.6 
million for the first half of 1998 before its second filing in 
federal Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes merged in 1997 with Access Beyond, a Gaithersburg,  
Md.-based company headed by Howard. Howard took over leadership of 
Hayes, focusing on digital and other new technologies. But the 
company's slow response to faster modems and the Asian economic 
crisis undercut turnaround efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes hit a peak of $250 million in annual revenue before  
entering Chapter 11 the first time in 1994. Co-founder Dennis Hayes 
argued successfully against takeover bids at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes stock had gone over $13 a share a year ago, but plummeted  
to trade at only pennies per share in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes was a 29-year-old engineer when he and a partner worked on  
his dining room table to create home-use modems. His company began 
in 1978, and soon, Hayes modems and ``Hayes-compatible'' became 
part of the industry language. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, from pioneering industry standards, they had  
opportunities that, with hindsight now, they did not follow up 
on,'' said Benn Konsynski, a professor at Emory University's 
Goizueta School of Business. ``There are a lot of 
`could-have-beens' with that story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While no one was answering the telephone Tuesday at Hayes  
headquarters, callers were switched to a recording that promoted 
Hayes products or directed them to the company's World Wide Web 
site. The Hayes home page offers a limited-edition, 56K, 20th 
anniversary modem, signed by Dennis Hayes.

<HEADLINE> Chill Helps Jags Prepare for Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- A cold front plunged temperatures into  
the low 20s this week in north Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	That's perfect weather as far as the Jacksonville Jaguars are  
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	They need whatever help they can get as they prepare for their  
first cold-weather game of the season on Sunday against the New 
York Jets in a second-round playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest weekend forecast for the New York area calls for  
temperatures in the low 30s, with a chance of rain and snow. 
</P>
<P>
	Add the swirling winds at the Meadowlands, and 75,000 fans who  
haven't seen a home playoff game in 12 years and you've got an 
atmosphere that will be difficult to duplicate at practices in 
Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had numerous cold weather experiences, both positive and  
negative,'' coach Tom Coughlin said. ``I'm certain we can't mimic 
below-freezing temperatures here too often. But there's a little 
bite in the air, and if it stays that way, we'll be able to get 
something done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Colorado, left tackle Tony Boselli always tapers his  
jersey sleeves so that they barely cover his shoulder pads. The 
idea is to not give defenders something to grab. He said he doesn't 
plan a change for this game. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hope guys look past it and just play the game,'' Boselli  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a fact that it's going to be cold and it's going to  
be windy. So let's cry about it now and get it all out, then go 
play the game. Because once you get up there, nobody cares if the 
weather's bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An assistant for Bill Parcells when he was with the New York  
Giants, Coughlin knows how the cold temperatures and swirling winds 
can affect a game at the Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
	He's seen the 1-yard punts. He's seen passing games destroyed.  
He's seen that overhead garage-like door in the west end zone 
opened and closed at just the right time for the home team. 
</P>
<P>
	``He used to do that,'' Coughlin said. ``I'll be looking for  
that one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'll also spend the week preparing his team for things it can  
control, like drilling his kickers on the physics of the swirling 
winds and telling receivers to lock onto Mark Brunell's passes for 
a split-second longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd say 98 percent of the time, Mark throws with enough  
velocity that wind is not going to take his ball,'' Coughlin said. 
``But for a receiver, he has to stay with a ball a lot longer in 
the wind. It'll move right before it gets into his hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cold weather could just be part of a bigger problem for the  
Jaguars: their inability to win important games on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Lost in this successful season is the fact that not since the  
1996 playoff upset of the Denver Broncos has Jacksonville beaten a 
winning team away from home. 
</P>
<P>
	Their biggest road game of this season resulted in a 30-15 loss  
at Pittsburgh. Even that came on an unusually warm day. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I tell these guys is, don't try to be a hero,''  
said defensive lineman John Jurkovic, a former Green Bay Packers 
player. ``Don't try to be Superman with no sleeves and all that. 
You just want to be comfortable. Make it so you're comfortable from 
the first snap to the last snap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another piece of advice offered by Boselli would be appropriate  
regardless of the conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to run the ball, you've got to be physical, pound and  
control the line of scrimmage,'' he said. ``The wind will be a 
challenge for Mark and the receivers. If we can run the ball, we 
can take a lot of pressure off that.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Denies AOL Exclusive Phrase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- A federal judge turned down America  
Online's request that he make AT&AMP;T stop telling e-mail users ``You 
have mail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T maintains that it's a commonly used English phrase and AOL  
cannot claim an exclusive right. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue landed in court after AT&AMP;T started using the phrase in  
December on its WorldNet e-mail service, and Dulles-based Internet 
provider AOL sought a temporary restraining order. 
</P>
<P>
	When AOL subscribers get electronic mail, a computer voice  
announces ``You've got mail'' and the message ``You have mail'' 
appears on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL's use of the phrase went beyond computers with the release  
of the movie ``You've Got Mail,'' starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan 
as e-mail pen pals. 
</P>
<P>
	However, on Dec. 24, U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton of  
Alexandria rejected AOL's request that he block AT&AMP;T from using 
``You have mail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no likelihood AOL would suffer irreparable harm if the  
request was denied, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also refused to block AT&AMP;T from using ``Buddy List''  
and the abbreviation ``I M'' with its free instant messaging 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL said it had registered ``Buddy List'' as a trademark for the  
address book in its own instant messaging service and has applied 
for a trademark on ``I M.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge did not elaborate, and his law clerk, Brent Del Monte,  
also would not give details. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton did not stop the case from going to trial, although no  
trial date was set. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T told the judge AOL is trying to claim exclusivity for  
commonly used English words and terms that are familiar on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel this sort of overreaching by one company raises  
serious concern about whether AOL is truly committed to keeping the 
Internet an open platform,'' said James Cicconi, AT&AMP;T's general 
counsel and executive vice president for law and government 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL believes the case has nothing to do with keeping the  
Internet open, but instead involves a company's right to retain a 
valuable trademark, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``AT&AMP;T is trying to free-ride on a term that has widely and  
historically been used on America Online,'' said AOL spokeswoman 
Tricia Primrose.

<HEADLINE> Big Mac Shortage Hits Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- McDonald's restaurants in Britain apologized to  
millions of unhappy customers Tuesday for running out of Big Macs 
during a weekend promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	Ads in national newspapers, headlined ``A message for Big Mac  
lovers,'' followed the restaurant chain's two-for-one Big Mac offer 
to celebrate its 25th anniversary in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	The promotion, which also had been advertised on television,  
turned into a fiasco after massive demand over the weekend caused 
many of the nation's 922 outlets to run out of food and turn away 
long lines of customers. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's bosses said they had expected to sell 2 million Big  
Macs during the promotion -- four times the normal level -- but soon 
found that the demand was twice that. 
</P>
<P>
	Full-page ads in British newspapers Tuesday apologized to  
customers and assured them that ``we are working with our suppliers 
to resolve the situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $3.28 two-for-one Big Mac offer runs through Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Fiesta Bowl So Bad a Ref Got Hurt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- It was so bad an official got hurt. The  
surprising thing is he ruptured a tendon in his calf instead of his 
arm. That's how many yellow penalty flags littered the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee 23, Florida State 16 was tolerable as a first-round  
playoff game. Not as the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	It's what happens when student-athletes and their coaches have  
too much time to study. It's what happens when they go without 
playing real games for too long, when the regular season ends the 
first week in December and the suits who run the Bowl Championship 
Series lead them around like show ponies for a month to build 
suspense. 
</P>
<P>
	Suspense?  
</P>
<P>
	The Kennedys' annual touch football game has to be more  
interesting than this. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State had more penalty yards than rushing yards (110 vs.  
108). They got caught roughing Tennessee's kicker twice. In the 
first half. Their own kicker hit himself with the ball. Attempting 
an onsides kick. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not the way we got to where we are,'' Florida State  
coach Bobby Bowden said. ``I thought we were a very sloppy football 
team tonight, but they were, too. Being off a month and a half -- we 
probably could have done a little better if we hadn't been off that 
long. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both of us,'' he added, ``laid off way too long.''  
</P>
<P>
	Except for the turnover-fest of the final minutes, the only  
suspense this Fiesta Bowl offered was when those few Tennessee fans 
who stayed behind switched from the game to Monday night's two-hour 
``Ally McBeal'' extravaganza. 
</P>
<P>
	Remember how smug the BCS power brokers seemed only a day ago?  
The only time they smiled this night was when ABC and Keith 
Jackson, working his last broadcast, mercifully signed off. 
</P>
<P>
	After his Ohio State team had beaten Texas A&AMP;M in the Sugar  
Bowl,coach John Cooper pleaded one more time with voters in The 
Associated Press poll. His argument: If No. 2 Florida State barely 
beat top-ranked Tennessee, he wanted the sports writers to consider 
the Buckeyes for the national title. 
</P>
<P>
	After watching this game, maybe Cooper should have made that  
argument the other way around. Ohio State might have forced 
Tennessee to play like the national champions they're being labeled 
today. Beating a depleted Florida State team didn't require the 
Vols to do much more than show up in time for the kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
	At times, it seemed the Seminoles put an offense on the field  
just to buy the defense a Gatorade break. Florida State's first 
scoring drive was three plays for 3 yards. Its second was 10 plays 
for 10 yards. The Seminoles fumbled four times. Their quarterback, 
20-year-old sophomore Marcus Outzen, seemed reluctant to throw the 
ball. He had a good reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting only his third game because of an injury to frontliner  
Chris Weinke, he completed just 9-of-22 throws to his guys. He 
completed two more to the other guys. Still, it was better than 
running -- Outzen carried 18 times for minus-1 yard. 
</P>
<P>
	But give him credit for this much: He didn't use any of the  
dozen excuses available to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I probably played like it was the third start of my career,''  
he said. ``A lot of our offense played like it was the third start 
of their careers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Volunteers had the shorter layoff. That might explain why  
they were less inept. Tennessee was penalized nine times for 55 
yards, all but one of them for illegal motion by the offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were not hearing me,'' quarterback Tee Martin said.  
</P>
<P>
	But coach Phil Fulmer didn't buy the alibi. He knew sloppy  
football when he saw it. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could understand aggressive penalties,'' he said. ``But  
those kinds of things will drive you crazy and make you an old man 
quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few more games like this and coaches, aging by the minute,  
will be retiring in droves. 
</P>
<P>
	What this proved once more was that college football needs a  
playoff. It needs a playoff to build drama, to weed out pretenders, 
to make sure the national champion ends the season with an 
exclamation point, not a question mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Take all the arguments the BCS, its predecessors and allies have  
been making against a playoff system and pile them on top of each 
other on one side of the scale: A playoff cheapens the regular 
season; it commercializes the game too much; it trivializes the 
bowls that get left out; it puts too much pressure on the kids and 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Put a videotape of this game on the other side of the scale and  
ask yourself whether it was a worthy national championship game. 
Then remind anybody who answers yes that sometimes justice really 
is blind.

<HEADLINE> CBS Nabs 4th Straight Nielsen Lead / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Happy New Year, CBS. The network celebrated  
in style, dominating the holiday week's Nielsen ratings and marking 
its fourth consecutive victory as the most-watched broadcast 
network. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS' Sunday night lineup of ``Touched by an Angel,'' ``60  
Minutes'' and an airing of the Harrison Ford film ``Sabrina'' were 
the three highest-rated programs of the week. The Kevin 
Costner-Whitney Houston movie ``The Bodyguard'' also was a hit, 
ranking eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boy, this feels good,'' CBS Television President Leslie  
Moonves said Tuesday. He noted that CBS traditionally performs well 
during the holidays: ``We feel we're the most family oriented 
network.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's bad luck contributed to CBS' success, according to Nielsen  
Media Research figures. New Year's Eve fell on Thursday, sinking 
NBC's key lineup that includes ``Friends'' and ``ER'' and pushing 
the network to its second-lowest weekly rating of the 1998-99 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	For Dec. 28-Jan. 3, CBS had a 9.2 average rating and 15 share.  
ABC, boosted by ``NFL Monday Night Football'' and college bowl 
games, was second with an 8.5 rating and 14 share. NBC and Fox tied 
for third with matching 7.1 ratings and 12 shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the fledgling networks, WB was the front-runner with a 2.9  
rating and 5 share, compared to UPN's 1.5 rating, 3 share, and PAX 
TV's 0.7 rating, 1 share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. Share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS is not a one-week wonder. For the season to date, its 9.1  
average puts it in first place, ahead of NBC's average of 8.7. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS has been buoyed overall by its acquisition of NFL  
broadcasts, which are drawing more young, male viewers to the 
network. Traditionally, CBS audiences have been older and heavily 
female. 
</P>
<P>
	``Men, more specifically men under the age of 35, did not know  
CBS existed,'' Moonves said. ``Now they're saying 'Gee, they've got 
a show called 'JAG,' they've got a show called 'Martial Law.' 
They've got a show called 'Walker, Texas Ranger.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the evening news programs, NBC's ``Nightly News'' was the  
most-watched with a 9.0 rating and 17 share. ABC's ``World News 
Tonight'' had a 8.3 rating and 16 share and the ``CBS Evening 
News'' had a 8.0 rating and 15 share. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, the top 10 shows, their networks and ratings were:  
</P>
<P>
	``Touched By an Angel,'' CBS, 16.4; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 14.3;  
``CBS Sunday Movie: Sabrina,'' CBS, 14.0; ``Rose Bowl (postgame): 
UCLA vs. Wisconsin,'' ABC, 13.9; ``Fox NFC Wildcard (postgame): 
Green Bay at San Francisco,'' Fox, 12.1; ``NFL Monday Night 
Football: Pittsburgh at Jacksonville,'' ABC, 11.5; ``Sugar Bowl: 
Ohio State vs. Texas A&AMP;M,'' ABC, 11.5; ``CBS Tuesday Movie: The 
Bodyguard,'' CBS, 11.1; ``The X-Files,'' Fox, 10.5; ``20-20 
(Sunday),'' ABC, 9.8.

<HEADLINE>  Vols Defense Rises to the Occasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Tennessee can play a little D, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Florida State came into Monday night's Fiesta Bowl with the  
top-ranked defense in the country. The Seminoles were as good as 
advertised, but weren't the only good defense on the field at Sun 
Devil Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got a lot of motivation from that,'' said linebacker Al  
Wilson, who led the Vols with nine tackles. ``All year we've been a 
good defense. You can't take anything away from Florida State, they 
are a great defense, but we wanted to show we had a good defense, 
too. I think we did that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a result the national championship trophy is headed to  
Knoxville, Tenn., with the Volunteers (13-0), not to Tallahassee, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tennessee offense managed two long pass plays in a 23-16  
victory, while Florida State didn't really have any big plays. The 
Seminoles' longest play of the game was 39 yards late in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what we said all week, if we could eliminate the big  
plays we'd have a chance to win,'' defensive coordinator John 
Chavis said. ``The kids made it happen. They just did a great 
job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vols held Florida State to 253 yards, forced three  
turnovers, and added a touchdown of its own on defensive back 
Dwayne Goodrich's 54-yard interception return. 
</P>
<P>
	``An interception for a touchdown in the national championship  
game,'' Goodrich said. ``That's like every DB's dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee held the Seminoles to 16 points despite being put into  
bad positions several times by offensive miscues or special teams 
plays by the Seminoles. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida's State's big-play receiver, Peter Warrick, had just one  
catch for 7 yards. His Tennessee counterpart, Peerless Price, had 
catches of 76 yards to set up one touchdown and another of 79 yards 
for the TD that sealed the Volunteers' first national title since 
1951. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vols harassed Florida State quarterback Marcus Outzen,  
making just his third start, into a 9-of-22 night for 145 yards, 
and dropped him for 54 yards in losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee felt its defense could hold its own if the offense  
didn't turn the ball over and special teams didn't give the 
Seminoles great field position. 
</P>
<P>
	Both fears came true in the first half.  
</P>
<P>
	Seminoles safety Derrick Gibson intercepted Tee Martin's pass  
and returned it 43 yards to the Volunteers 3, setting up Florida 
State's first touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the time the Vols staved off trouble.  
</P>
<P>
	It was 7-0 when Outzen tried to hit Warrick in the right flat.  
Goodrich picked it off and went 54 yards untouched for the score. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State again struck in the kicking game for the final  
points of the half. Warrick returned a punt 51 yards to the 
Tennessee 27, where he was stopped on a touchdown-saving tackle by 
punter David Leaverton. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles managed a first-and-goal at the Vols 5, but two  
penalties and a sack forced Florida State to settle for Sebastian 
Janikowski's 35-yard field goal to make it 14-9 at the break. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles, however, wouldn't score again until just 3:42  
remained and the Vols solidly ahead 23-9.

<HEADLINE> Phone Deal May Lower Cellular Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Consumers may see their cellular phone bills  
drop if Bell Atlantic Corp. is successful in its bid for AirTouch 
Communications Inc. as competition heats up in the $30 billion U.S. 
cellular phone market. 
</P>
<P>
	If Bell Atlantic can combine its East Coast network with  
AirTouch's West Coast network, they can put more pressure on AT&AMP;T 
to cut prices on its flat-rate cellular phone plan. MCI WorldCom 
Inc. and other companies also may have to act fast to get into the 
cellular market, analysts said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	While Bell Atlantic and AirTouch have confirmed they are  
negotiating, a deal could still fall apart. News reports and 
analysts have put the price tag at around $45 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	As technology for cellular phones has improved, and the need for  
them has increased, the number of users in the United States has 
soared to 61 million, up from just 14 million in 1993, according to 
the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Cell phones, however, are still a pricey luxury for many  
consumers, and the new one-rate plans are aimed at high-end 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	In May AT&AMP;T Corp., the nation's largest long-distance company,  
launched a plan that allows customers to call anywhere in the 
United States for $89.99 for 600 minutes of use. This allows 
consumers to avoid extra ``roaming'' charges when they travel 
outside their local area. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Bell Atlantic offered a competing plan at $159  
a month for 1,600 minutes. Bell Atlantic, which has a strong 
network from Maine to South Carolina, has to charge more because it 
relies on costly agreements with other phone companies to complete 
calls outside its areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Both plans, however, are still out of reach for many cellular  
phone users, who spend $46 a month, on average, plus long-distance 
charges, according to the Cellular Telecommunications Industry 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, phone companies ``are going where the money is,''  
said Jeffrey Kagan, an independent telecommunications analyst in 
Atlanta. ``Competitive pressures from Bell Atlantic will bring that 
down market to the average consumer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic, which is awaiting governmental approval of its  
$65 billion purchase of GTE Corp., will likely have to sell off any 
assets that overlap with AirTouch. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Hines, a telecom analyst with BT Alex Brown, estimated  
that if Bell Atlantic's combinations with both GTE and AirTouch go 
through, the combined company would have to sell off 15 percent of 
its U.S. assets to reduce its market power in areas like San 
Francisco, San Diego and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether or not the Bell Atlantic talks with AirTouch are  
successful, the cellular phone industry is going to continue to 
consolidate as companies try to piece together nationwide networks. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom, which has been sitting on the cellular sidelines,  
is one company that Wall Street expects to get in the game. Nextel 
Communications Inc., one of the largest independent wireless phone 
companies, is the most likely target, said Hines.

<HEADLINE> 'Cupid' Takes Aim From New Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Turns out broadcast networks can have a heart  
when it comes to shows worthy of a second chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cupid,'' about an obsessive matchmaker who is either the Greek  
god of love or just plain loony, has drawn ratings that are less 
than Olympian. In fact, it and fellow ABC freshman ``Fantasy 
Island'' are the lowest-rated major network series this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fantasy Island'' was recently given the hook. But ABC,  
recognizing the intricacies of the television landscape and the 
fact that it has a good show worth saving, is sticking with 
``Cupid.'' For now. 
</P>
<P>
	The series, starring Jeremy Piven and Paula Marshall, moves to a  
new time slot this week, 9 p.m. EST Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just really love the show,'' said ABC Entertainment  
President Jamie Tarses. ``For us, you have to designate those shows 
you're going to be patient with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patience, she said, is a quality much needed by broadcast  
networks vying for viewers in the multichannel TV world. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's too many options right now,'' Tarses said. ``Newsweek  
and Time did stories about how it was so courageous of us to stick 
with 'Sports Night' after four weeks. I told both of them, 'I must 
argue with your premise.' I'd love to say I'm courageous; it wasn't 
a courageous move. 
</P>
<P>
	``People do not find shows that quickly anymore. There are too  
many choices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Cupid'' fits the profile of a series that deserves nurturing.  
It started in a tough Saturday time slot, the evening that 
traditionally draws the fewest viewers, and wasn't helped by 
struggling lead-in ``Fantasy Island.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The executive producer for ``Cupid'' has credentials that  
suggest his series will be consistently watchable. Scott Winant 
worked on ``thirtysomething'' and the short-lived but beloved ``My 
So-Called Life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's another necessary element: ``Cupid'' is a fresh take on  
the hourlong format (think Fox's ``Ally McBeal'') that broadcasters 
need to draw viewers who increasingly are turning to cable channels 
for something different. 
</P>
<P>
	Piven (of ``Ellen'' and films including ``Very Bad Things'' and  
``Grosse Point Blank'') plays the title character, who insists to 
his court-appointed therapist Claire Allen (Marshall) that he is on 
a mission. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been banished to contemporary Chicago from Olympus, and  
must match up 100 couples before he can return. Each match counts, 
we're told, only ``if the gods decide it's true love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The catch is that Cupid, going by the alias Trevor Hale, is  
barred from any bow-and-arrow shenanigans. He can employ only the 
mundane strategies favored by dating services and meddling parents. 
</P>
<P>
	A blend of comedy and drama, the series floats on well-cast  
guest stars, Piven's smart-aleck charm, and clever, rapid-fire 
dialogue reminiscent of 1930s screwball movies. And there's 
chemistry between Trevor and Claire, whose bickering suggests a 
fateful attraction. 
</P>
<P>
	The premise may sound sappy, but the execution is sparkling.  
</P>
<P>
	``Cupid'' has won kudos from critics and the grassroots group  
Viewers for Quality Television. Now all the series needs is more 
viewers -- which producer Winant acknowledges aren't a gimme on 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's lock on the evening has faltered since ``Seinfeld'' ended,  
but ``Friends,'' ``Frasier'' and ``ER'' have kept the network No. 
1. ABC's lead-in for ``Cupid,'' the action series ``Vengeance 
Unlimited,'' is less than an ideal match. 
</P>
<P>
	Winant admits he would have preferred moving to 10 p.m. Monday  
after the season ends for ABC's ``NFL Monday Night Football.'' 
There simply aren't that many spots available for hourlong shows on 
ABC or other networks; blame the proliferation of news magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	But Winant is striving for optimism.  
</P>
<P>
	``More people are watching television on Thursday so that's a  
good thing,'' he said. ``If people are for any reason becoming 
tired with the (NBC) comedy block, I think we are providing an 
alternative -- sophisticated, intelligent comedy in an hour form.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Cupid'' started out as a far different idea.  
</P>
<P>
	``This idea was pitched to me by Mandalay Television  
(co-producer with Columbia TriStar Television) as really Cupid: 
togas, Mount Olympus, arrows. I didn't know what to do with that, 
but I was intrigued,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He and co-executive producer Rob Thomas worked out a version  
with a more enigmatic lead character. Like the classic Christmas 
film ``Miracle on 34th Street,'' the series wants to give the 
impression there's magic at work even when none is shown, Winant 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe Trevor is Cupid, maybe not.  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want you to know,'' said Winant.  
</P>
<P>
	The real magic would be if ``Cupid'' woos enough viewers to give  
ABC reason to renew it for next season. Winant, who has been 
through this dance before with ``My So-Called Life,'' waxes 
philosophical. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look, I would rather have done 19 episodes of 'Life' than six  
years of another series I didn't have my heart in. I'll be able to 
carry my personal success with that series with me my whole career. 
</P>
<P>
	``If 'Cupid' runs only one season, I'll be very grateful for  
that as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ....  
</P>
<P>
	IN THE DOGHOUSE: The sitcoms ``The Drew Carey Show'' and  
``Unhappily Ever After'' are among those criticized for anti-animal 
messages in the annual ``Foe-Paw Report'' from the Ark Trust, Inc., 
a nonprofit, animal protection group. According to the report, 
Carey's show mocked anti-fur coat activists while ``Unhappily Ever 
After'' played the death and abuse of pet cats for laughs. Others 
criticized in the report include magazines that showcase fur 
fashions and a TV commercial in which fake gerbils are playfully 
shot out of a cannon.

<HEADLINE>  Vols Defense Rises to the Occasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Tennessee can play a little D, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Florida State came into Monday night's Fiesta Bowl with the  
top-ranked defense in the country. The Seminoles were as good as 
advertised, but weren't the only good defense on the field at Sun 
Devil Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got a lot of motivation from that,'' said linebacker Al  
Wilson, who led the Vols with nine tackles. ``All year we've been a 
good defense. You can't take anything away from Florida State, they 
are a great defense, but we wanted to show we had a good defense, 
too. I think we did that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a result the national championship trophy is headed to  
Knoxville, Tenn., with the Volunteers (13-0), not to Tallahassee, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tennessee offense managed two long pass plays in a 23-16  
victory, while Florida State didn't really have any big plays. The 
Seminoles' longest play of the game was 39 yards late in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what we said all week, if we could eliminate the big  
plays we'd have a chance to win,'' defensive coordinator John 
Chavis said. ``The kids made it happen. They just did a great 
job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vols held Florida State to 253 yards, forced three  
turnovers, and added a touchdown of its own on defensive back 
Dwayne Goodrich's 54-yard interception return. 
</P>
<P>
	``An interception for a touchdown in the national championship  
game,'' Goodrich said. ``That's like every DB's dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee held the Seminoles to 16 points despite being put into  
bad positions several times by offensive miscues or special teams 
plays by the Seminoles. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida's State's big-play receiver, Peter Warrick, had just one  
catch for 7 yards. His Tennessee counterpart, Peerless Price, had 
catches of 76 yards to set up one touchdown and another of 79 yards 
for the TD that sealed the Volunteers' first national title since 
1951. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vols harassed Florida State quarterback Marcus Outzen,  
making just his third start, into a 9-of-22 night for 145 yards, 
and dropped him for 54 yards in losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee felt its defense could hold its own if the offense  
didn't turn the ball over and special teams didn't give the 
Seminoles great field position. 
</P>
<P>
	Both fears came true in the first half.  
</P>
<P>
	Seminoles safety Derrick Gibson intercepted Tee Martin's pass  
and returned it 43 yards to the Volunteers 3, setting up Florida 
State's first touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the time the Vols staved off trouble.  
</P>
<P>
	It was 7-0 when Outzen tried to hit Warrick in the right flat.  
Goodrich picked it off and went 54 yards untouched for the score. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State again struck in the kicking game for the final  
points of the half. Warrick returned a punt 51 yards to the 
Tennessee 27, where he was stopped on a touchdown-saving tackle by 
punter David Leaverton. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles managed a first-and-goal at the Vols 5, but two  
penalties and a sack forced Florida State to settle for Sebastian 
Janikowski's 35-yard field goal to make it 14-9 at the break. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles, however, wouldn't score again until just 3:42  
remained and the Vols solidly ahead 23-9.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Higher; Dow Up 134 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were broadly higher this afternoon, as  
investors ignored a softer dollar against the yen, slumping bonds 
and a few negative earnings announcements and bid up a wide 
sampling of equities issues. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 134.65 at 9,318.92, a short distance away from its record 
closing high of 9,374.27 last Nov. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were in record territory. The  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index up 39.16 at 2,247.21, in 
record high territory for the third trading session in a row. The 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 14.98 at 1,243.08, beating its 
previous closing record of 1,241.81 on Dec. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Big Board, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a  
6-to-5 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 600.1 
million shares, down from Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Jones industrials were pushed higher by runups in all kinds  
of stocks, from technology to consumer to industrial isseus. IBM 
was up 5 9/16 to 188 9/16, United Technologies was up 4 at 112, 
AT&AMP;T was up 1 7/8 at 79 3/4, Alcoa was up 2 9/16 at 76 5/116, and Procter 
&AMP; Gamble was up 1 13/16 at 91 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	They rose despite a sharp drop in the dollar against the yen  
that produced an equally sharp drop in bond prices. The dollar was 
trading at just over 111 yen. The 30-year U.S. government bond was 
down 7/8 point, and its yield, which moves opposite the price was 
just above 5.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Canelo, market strategist at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter  
Reynolds said stock investors were unfazed by the dollar's drop 
against the yen because the dollar was higher against European 
currencies in the wake of the inauguration Monday of the new Euro. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese investors are not big buyers of U.S. stocks, but  
European investors are, Canelo pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, stock investors don't care if bonds are down,  
either, Canelo said. ``The fact that they keep buying equities is a 
vote of confidence in the American economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The market was little affected by a Commerce Department report  
that U.S. construction spending increased for the sixth consecutive 
month in November, propelled by strong gains in housing and 
government projects. Spending advanced 0.9 percent from the month 
before to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $677.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	AirTouch Communications shares were up 6 7/16 at 74 11/16. The  
company received a buyout offer from Britain's Vodafone Group PLC. 
Shares of Bell Atlantic, which was already in talks to buy 
AirTouch, were up 1 7/8 at 53 13/16.

<HEADLINE> Judge Denies AOL Exclusive Phrase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- America Online doesn't have exclusive  
rights to tell computer users that ``You have mail,'' at least not 
for now, a federal judge ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue landed in court after AT&AMP;T Corp. started using the  
phrase in December on its WorldNet e-mail service. Dulles-based 
Internet provider AOL sought a temporary restraining order, arguing 
exclusive rights to the term. 
</P>
<P>
	When AOL's subscribers get electronic mail, a computer voice  
says, ``You've got mail'' and the more formally worded message 
``You have mail'' appears on the screen. ``You've Got Mail'' even 
became the title of a new movie starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan as 
e-mail pen pals. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 24, U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton of Alexandria  
rejected AOL's request for an injunction to block use of ``You have 
mail'' and two other Internet terms, ``Buddy list'' and ``I M,'' 
for instant messaging service. But the judge did not stop the case 
from going to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel this sort of overreaching by one company raises  
serious concern about whether AOL is truly committed to keeping the 
Internet an open platform, or whether it intends to leverage its 
dominance to make the Net more proprietary,'' said James Cicconi, 
AT&AMP;T's general counsel and executive vice president for law and 
government affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We realize this is just the first round, but AT&AMP;T is confident  
we will also prevail at trial,'' Cicconi said. 
</P>
<P>
	A call to America Online was not immediately returned today.

<HEADLINE> Fugitive Computer Hacker Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Agent Steal,'' a computer  
hacker-turned-government informant who claimed to have helped put 
superhacker Kevin Mitnick behind bars, is back in custody after 
being on the run for more than three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Justin Petersen, 38, was accused of leaving a halfway house in  
August and could get up to two years in prison. He was captured 
without incident Dec. 11 in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Petersen, a native of Lincoln, Neb., pleaded guilty in 1993 to  
federal computer crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	He admitted stealing data from a credit information firm,  
hacking into a financial services business to pay himself $150,000 
and helping rig a radio call-in contest by seizing control of 
telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	He got nearly 3 1/2 years in prison and three years of supervised  
release. But his sentence was delayed while he helped the 
government in an ``undercover capacity,'' as one court document put 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Petersen claimed the FBI paid his rent and flew him to computer  
conferences to spy on other hackers. He also said he helped show 
that Mitnick, the only hacker to make the FBI's Ten Most Wanted 
list, was committing offenses while on probation for computer 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitnick was arrested in 1995, accused of stealing 20,000 credit  
card numbers. He faces trial in Los Angeles on April 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Petersen was completing his sentence in halfway house in the Los  
Angeles area when he went on the run. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer, Nathan Hochman, said his client ``hasn't admitted or  
denied the allegations yet.''

<HEADLINE> Russian Creditors May Vote on Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bank of America has asked Russia's foreign  
creditors to choose between two settlement options on $20 billion 
of bad debt, one of which would demand immediate payment, the Dow 
Jones Newswires reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to debtholders Tuesday, Bank of America asked major  
lenders in the so-called London Club of commercial creditors to 
``either declare the loans to be immediately due and payable'' or 
reserve their right to do so until future notice, the report said. 
The creditors were asked to vote by Jan. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the 1997 debt agreement, if more than half of the holders  
of principal notes ask for immediate repayment, Russia would be 
legally required to repay the full $20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank would not confirm the report, Bob Wynne, a Bank of  
America spokesman said Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Bank of America, which is the payment agent for more  
than 600 commercial lenders, declared Russia in default after the 
state-owned Vnesheconombank failed to make a $362 million interest 
payment by the end of a grace period.

<HEADLINE> Bell Atlantic, AirTouch Talking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Consumers may see their cellular phone bills  
drop if Bell Atlantic Corp. is successful in its bid for AirTouch 
Communications Inc. as competition heats up in the $30 billion U.S. 
cellular phone market. 
</P>
<P>
	If Bell Atlantic can combine its East Coast network with  
AirTouch's West Coast network, they can put more pressure on AT&AMP;T 
to cut prices on its flat-rate cellular phone plan. MCI WorldCom 
Inc. and other companies also may have to act fast to get into the 
cellular market, analysts said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	While Bell Atlantic and AirTouch have confirmed they are  
negotiating, a deal could still fall apart. News reports and 
analysts have put the price tag at around $45 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	There also could be a competing suitor for AirTouch. The Wall  
Street Journal reported today that Britain's Vodafone Group PLC has 
offered to buy AirTouch for more than $45 billion although the 
proposal hasn't been made public. Vodafone is the biggest mobile 
phone provider in the United Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal, citing unidentified people familiar with the  
situation, said terms of the Vodafone offer weren't immediately 
available but it was mostly for stock. 
</P>
<P>
	A Vodafone spokesman said today the company wasn't commenting on  
the report. A Bell Atlantic spokesman had no comment and a call to 
AirTouch was not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	As technology for cellular phones has improved, and the need for  
them has increased, the number of users in the United States has 
soared to 61 million, up from just 14 million in 1993, according to 
the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Cell phones, however, are still a pricey luxury for many  
consumers, and the new one-rate plans are aimed at high-end 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	In May AT&AMP;T Corp., the nation's largest long-distance company,  
launched a plan that allows customers to call anywhere in the 
United States for $89.99 for 600 minutes of use. This allows 
consumers to avoid extra ``roaming'' charges when they travel 
outside their local area. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Bell Atlantic offered a competing plan at $159  
a month for 1,600 minutes. Bell Atlantic, which has a strong 
network from Maine to South Carolina, has to charge more because it 
relies on costly agreements with other phone companies to complete 
calls outside its areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Both plans, however, are still out of reach for many cellular  
phone users, who spend $46 a month, on average, plus long-distance 
charges, according to the Cellular Telecommunications Industry 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, phone companies ``are going where the money is,''  
said Jeffrey Kagan, an independent telecommunications analyst in 
Atlanta. ``Competitive pressures from Bell Atlantic will bring that 
down market to the average consumer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic, which is awaiting governmental approval of its  
$65 billion purchase of GTE Corp., will likely have to sell off any 
assets that overlap with AirTouch. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Hines, a telecom analyst with BT Alex Brown, estimated  
that if Bell Atlantic's combinations with both GTE and AirTouch go 
through, the combined company would have to sell off 15 percent of 
its U.S. assets to reduce its market power in areas like San 
Francisco, San Diego and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether or not the Bell Atlantic talks with AirTouch are  
successful, the cellular phone industry is going to continue to 
consolidate as companies try to piece together nationwide networks. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom, which has been sitting on the cellular sidelines,  
is one company that Wall Street expects to get in the game. Nextel 
Communications Inc., one of the largest independent wireless phone 
companies, is the most likely target, said Hines.

<HEADLINE> Okla. City Bomb Witness in Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The star witness in the Oklahoma City bombing  
trial appealed his 12-year sentence Tuesday, claiming the judge 
wrongly believed he sold stolen guns to pay for the plot. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief filed at the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,  
attorney Michael McGuire contended prosecutors never proved Michael 
Fortier helped Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols finance the April 
19, 1995, bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States has never believed or had any credible  
information that Michael Fortier sold firearms to support the 
bombing,'' McGuire said. ``If this was truly the case, Fortier no 
doubt would have been charged like McVeigh and Nichols.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Van Bebber based his sentence in part  
on a finding that Fortier helped pay for the bomb by giving McVeigh 
some of the money he made selling firearms stolen from an Arkansas 
gun dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	A former serviceman from Arizona, Fortier served in the Army  
with McVeigh and Nichols and pleaded guilty to failing to alert 
authorities in advance about the plot to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah 
Federal Building. The blast killed 168 people and injured hundreds 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	He also pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents and transporting  
stolen firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortier testified at the trials of both McVeigh and Nichols.  
</P>
<P>
	McVeigh was convicted of federal murder, conspiracy and weapons  
counts last year. He is appealing his jury-imposed death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy  
last year and sentenced to life imprisonment.

<HEADLINE> Storm Forecasting Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- It began innocently enough as an upper air  
disturbance drifting off Asia's eastern coast. Then it turned ugly 
over the northern Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time forecasters factored in the jet stream, the Arctic  
air mass entrenched over the Great Lakes and moisture in the balmy 
Gulf of Mexico, the signs became clearer. 
</P>
<P>
	Something grim was approaching the United States.  
</P>
<P>
	By Christmas Day, Chicago meteorologist Tom Skilling peered into  
his high-tech equipment and ``saw a system developing that looked 
pretty interesting, pretty ominous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	National Weather Service meteorologist Paul Merzlock was  
convinced by the evidence three days later. ``We knew it was going 
to hit,'' he said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The first fierce snowstorm of 1999 seemed to be a no-brainer for  
weather forecasters who -- thanks to modern radar, computers and 
satellites -- predicted a direct hit days in advance. 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't enough for Jamie Silver, manager of a Thompson Food  
Basket in Peoria. ``They always say we're going to get 2 or 3 
inches, and then it turns out to be just some flurries,'' Silver 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't stock up in time, and storm-frightened shoppers  
cleaned out the store's milk and bread supplies shortly after he 
opened on Saturday. ``We're talking about hundreds of loaves, gone 
in minutes,'' Silver said. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost 22 inches of snow fell at Chicago's O'Hare International  
Airport from Friday through Sunday, the most for a single storm 
since 23 inches fell in 1967, and the second biggest total since 
record-keeping began in 1885. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 17 deaths in Illinois were linked to the storm. The  
governor on Monday declared the entire state a disaster area, 
making money available to aid cleanup and recovery efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	As bad as it was, forecasters said Chicago's second-worst  
snowstorm could have been a whole lot worse without their warnings 
-- plus a little luck. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you imagine this one coming on a work week?'' Skilling,  
who has been a television forecaster for 30 years. ``The weekend 
timing of this was great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, there was little warning of the Jan. 26, 1967,  
blizzard because ``computer modeling was, relatively speaking, in 
its infancy,'' Skilling said. 
</P>
<P>
	Satellites and radar also were much less sophisticated in '67.  
And that storm hit on a Thursday. Abandoned buses and cars stuck in 
snow drifts in the middle of major thoroughfares were a common 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
	Even during the January 1979 storm, when 34 inches of snow over  
10 days helped boot an unprepared mayor out of office, weather 
technology was ``nothing like we have today,'' Skilling said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to today's technology, however, Chicago's Streets and  
Sanitation Department began preparing six days in advance, said 
spokesman Terry Levin. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Arima, manager of a Treasure Island Foods on Chicago's  
North Side, said he began preparing early. By week's end, he had 
stocked up on enough milk, bread and other staples to stay open. 
</P>
<P>
	``People stayed home and got ready for the storm,'' he said.  
``Had everybody gone to work and gone shopping afterward it would 
have been a real mess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most major streets remained open Monday and there were no major  
traffic accidents despite residents sweating over shovels to free 
their buried cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's pray for 40 degrees next week,'' Levin said.  
</P>
<P>
	That's not in the cards. Forecasters predicted more snow late  
today and over the weekend.

<HEADLINE> Ogunleye To Stay With Indiana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Defensive end Adewale Ogunleye,  
Indiana's career leader in sacks and tackles for losses, decided to 
pass up the NFL draft and will return for his final year of 
eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-5, 260-pound senior will graduate in May and plans to  
enroll in graduate school during the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This wasn't an easy decision, but I am really excited about  
the choice that I have made,'' said Ogunleye, a first-team All-Big 
Ten selection in 1997 and a second-team pick this past season. 
``Returning to school gives me an opportunity to get a jump-start 
on my graduate education, and it also allows me to improve my 
learning curve on the football field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ogunleye, who has 26 1/2 sacks and 53 tackles, was regarded as a  
possible first-round pick in the draft.

<HEADLINE> Ashcroft Decision Opens the Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John Ashcroft's surprise decision to  
bypass the 2000 presidential campaign offers hope and caution to 
Republican candidates seeking the blessing of social conservative 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Several likely GOP candidates, including former Vice President  
Dan Quayle, millionaire Steve Forbes and religious activist Gary 
Bauer, could pick up support abandoned Tuesday by Ashcroft. Other 
less conservative prospects -- such as George W. Bush -- may not 
benefit directly, but could find lessons in Ashcroft's aborted bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the senator from Missouri, all these Republicans hope to  
pay allegiance to the religious right without appearing too 
conservative for the general election. Yet, as Ashcroft now knows, 
this is no easy task. 
</P>
<P>
	After spending a year laying the groundwork for a presidential  
bid, picking up endorsements of key social conservative leaders, 
Ashcroft decided not to run but to focus on re-election to the 
Senate instead. His decision left many social conservatives in the 
lurch. 
</P>
<P>
	``A number of us had put ourselves on the line for him and we  
had hoped he would run,'' said Paul Weyrich, president of the Free 
Congress Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very disappointed,'' said conservative activist Phyllis  
Schlafly. ``He has a record of electability that no one can 
match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The social conservative movement had gravitated toward  
Ashcroft and there was not an easy second choice,'' said Michael 
Farris, president of the Home School Legal Defense Associations in 
Purcellville, Va. ``There's a lot of head-scratching about what to 
do next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tired of watching conservative votes diluted in a large pool of  
right-wing candidates, Farris and Weyrich had tried with some 
success to rally support behind Ashcroft -- the conservative they 
felt had the best chance to get elected. 
</P>
<P>
	Farris now plans to organize a meeting of about 20 social  
conservative leaders in the next month. They hope to interview 
prospective GOP candidates and pick a new standard-bearer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the conservative movement learned a lesson in 1996: If  
we get fractured, we get rolled,'' Farris said. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is no obvious choice.  
</P>
<P>
	Forbes has shifted toward the right since his 1996 campaign, but  
is still not trusted by some social conservatives. ``His views are 
newly acquired, which is always problematic,'' Farris said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer is little-known and has never run for public office. ``I'm  
a big fan of his,'' Weyrich said, ``but some judgment has to be 
made: Can he be elected?'' Another social conservative leader, 
Donald Wildmon of the American Family Association, told Bauer on 
Monday that he would support him now that Ashcroft is out. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, even Wildmon said Bauer is a long shot. ``I know that.  
Gary knows that. Anybody with a half-brain knows that,'' Wildmon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle is popular among conservatives, but still carries the  
stigma of political miscues from his days as George Bush's vice 
president. ``I think it remains to be seen whether at this stage he 
can run a serious campaign,'' Weyrich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcaster Pat Buchanan, who did surprisingly well in 1996, is  
considering another run and could benefit from having one less 
social conservative in the race. Supporters of Bush, the Texas 
governor, believe he would benefit if he gets in the race and 
certifies his conservative credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	The same could be said of Elizabeth Dole, who hinted at her  
presidential ambitions Monday, and Sen. John McCain of Arizona. At 
a minimum, both establishment Republicans need to avoid stiff 
opposition from social conservatives during the presidential 
primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	That's where Ashcroft's experience offers a lesson of caution.  
</P>
<P>
	Even with his conservative credentials, Ashcroft was stung by  
criticism from the right when he tried last month to moderate his 
image. ``The things that are dividing us are defining us,'' he said 
in a Detroit speech. ``We must never confuse politics and piety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In hindsight, some Ashcroft advisers believe he was leaning  
against running for president by the time he delivered the December 
speech and was addressing mainstream voters in Missouri. Others 
believe he was trying to prove he had a message that would carry 
him beyond social conservative circles and to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, the reaction underscores how difficult it can be to  
simultaneously court conservatives who dominate primaries and 
moderates who hold sway in general elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a case study in the difficulty of balancing both  
ends against the middle,'' said Ralph Reed, a GOP consultant and 
former director of the Christian Coalition.

<HEADLINE> Automakers Report Strong Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Soaring sales of light trucks overcame declining  
demand for cars, allowing many automakers, including Ford Motor Co. 
and DaimlerChrysler AG to post strong U.S. sales results for both 
December as well as all of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts and executives said Tuesday a strong economy was behind  
the surge. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's easy credit and high consumer confidence,'' said  
analyst David Healy of Burnham Securities Inc. ``Both companies' 
actual results were better than either of them anticipated earlier 
this month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Motor Co. said its sales increased 7 percent in December  
over year-ago levels. For the year, Ford's sales rose 2 percent for 
its best year since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's SUVs -- the Explorer, Mercury Mountaineer and Lincoln  
Navigator -- set sales records in December. Sales of the Ford 
Mustang were also up sharply after the introduction of a reskinned 
model. The F-series pickup set a record for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler AG had its best year ever, with a 9 percent  
increase over 1997. For December, sales were up 7 percent. The 
figures do not include DaimlerChrylser's results for Mercedes-Benz, 
which are reported separately. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler had continued strong sales of its Dodge Durango  
SUV and Chrysler Concorde/300M sedans. It also saw a spike in 
minivan sales in December. Jamie Jameson, vice president of North 
American sales and marketing, said sales improved without new 
rebates and other incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp., the biggest automaker, planned to release  
its figures today, when yearend industry totals will be calculated. 
</P>
<P>
	Most other automakers also posted higher sales in December.  
Nissan Motor Co.'s sales increased 12 percent, thanks to a surge of 
orders for its light trucks. Even its car sales, which had been 
down for a few months, showed a 7 percent improvement. But for 
1998, the company's sales were down 14 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Major European automakers, including Mercedes-Benz, BMW and  
Volkswagen, said their sales zoomed in December. Mercedes-Benz was 
up 8 percent, BMW increased 15 percent and Volkswagen rose 48 
percent. Mercedes set a record for the year, with sales up 39 
percent. Volkswagen's sales for the year were up 59 percent for its 
best year since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the few automakers to see a decline was Hyundai. The  
Korean automaker's sales dropped 61 percent in December, and were 
down 20 percent for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Healy said it was likely that sales would decline slightly this  
month, but said a strong economy should keep car lots busy well 
into the first half of this year.

<HEADLINE> The Trial of the Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Before President Clinton was impeached, the  
congressman who will be the lead prosecutor said the House decision 
was ``merely'' that there was enough evidence for a Senate trial. 
</P>
<P>
	There's nothing mere about it now -- one Republican senator said  
it is not only the trial of the century but of all time. 
</P>
<P>
	And Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania also said it should be a  
full trial, with witnesses testifying before the Senate. He said so 
outside the White House Monday, after watching Clinton propose a 
tax break for long-term health care. Specter complimented Clinton 
for a good job in handling that business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
	In the unprecedented situation awaiting the Congress convening  
Wednesday, the incongruous is ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee,  
leads the 13 managers who will prosecute the impeachment case when 
it begins -- locking the normally talkative Senate into a rigid and 
silent role as Clinton's jury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we seek impeachment, not conviction nor censure,'' Hyde  
said on Dec. 11, as the committee brought its party-line charges 
against Clinton. ``Those are decisions for the other body, the 
Senate. We merely decide if there is enough for a trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was decided on near party-line votes in the House for two  
counts of impeachment -- perjury and obstruction of justice -- in the 
Monica Lewinsky sex scandal. Republican leaders blocked a vote on 
censure, scrapping that Democratic alternative, 230 to 204. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said flatly that censure was unconstitutional,  
although Hyde and others had earlier suggested it might be an 
option for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	It may yet be -- there are Republicans who see it as a way to  
settle the case short of firing the president, which Americans 
overwhelmingly oppose in public opinion polls. Of course the polls 
registered majority opposition to impeachment, too, and the House 
went ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the impeachment votes on Dec. 19, the House tone has  
hardened, with Hyde and his prosecution team demanding a full 
Senate trial to prove their case for conviction of the president. 
</P>
<P>
	But Senate leaders are talking of compromise, on trial and  
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, has guardedly  
endorsed the idea of an abbreviated trial without witnesses, 
followed by a test vote to determine whether two-thirds of the 
Senate considers Clinton's conduct, if proven, to warrant 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Assuming, as Senate leaders do, that there are not the votes to  
convict -- with 55 Republican senators, 45 Democrats and 67 votes 
required -- the impeachment trial could be adjourned by majority 
vote, and the Senate could consider censure. But that would take 
advance agreements; it isn't envisioned by the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``They hear the country, they want to get it concluded, and  
that's a way to get it concluded,'' said Rep. Asa Hutchinson, 
R-Ark., one of the House managers. Hutchinson said on ABC that 
there should be a trial, with witnesses, and that Ms. Lewinsky 
would be on the short list to testify ``in a very dignified way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But neither the dignity nor the duration of a Senate trial would  
be manageable once testimony began, although a majority could vote 
at any point to end the whole proceeding. Were Democrats to hold 
their lines, that would take the votes of at least six Republican 
senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's hints of a three-day trial led Hyde to write him that  
``the Senate should hear from live witnesses ...'' and should not 
short-circuit the case the House brought against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the ``extensive factual record'' compiled by special  
prosecutor Kenneth W. Starr was sufficient for House impeachment, 
but that the managers will want to summon witnesses at trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats called that inconsistent. Republican Sen. Mitch  
McConnell of Kentucky said it was noteworthy that the House chose 
not to hear from ``the characters that have become all too 
familiar'' in the Lewinsky scandal, and that he is not wildly 
interested in having them called before the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	During the House debate, Hyde said, ``We have been attacked for  
not producing fact witnesses,'' but the House didn't need them, 
with 60,000 pages of Starr evidence in hand. ``We had the facts -- 
under oath,'' he said then. 
</P>
<P>
	But now, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., complained, the House is  
trying to tell the Senate how it must proceed. Worse still, he 
said, one of the House managers, Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia, said 
senators don't have the attention span of the average juror, so the 
case will have to be simplified for them. 
</P>
<P>
	``That kind of condescending arrogance is not going well,''  
Leahy said on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	He was one of 16 senators on TV Sunday morning. Specter was  
another, and he said on NBC that even with witnesses, the trial can 
be expedited and brief. 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably less time than we spend on the Sunday talk shows,''  
he said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ryan, Brett, Yount Elected to Hall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nolan Ryan, George Brett and Robin Yount were  
voted into the Hall of Fame today, the biggest class of first-time 
candidates since Babe Ruth and four others were chosen in the 
original election of 1936. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan, the greatest power pitcher ever with a record 5,714  
strikeouts and seven no-hitters, was named on 98.79 percent of the 
ballots -- second-highest in history to Tom Seaver's 98.84 in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett, 13th on the career hits list with 3,154, made it with  
98.19 percent, the fourth-highest total. Yount, with 3,142 hits and 
two AL MVP awards, was elected with 77.46 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was flabbergasted. It just knocked me on the floor,'' Brett  
said of his vote total. ``Obviously, I was very, very pleased. But 
in all honesty, I was just as pleased for Robin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Of all the guys I played against,'' he said on a conference  
call, his voice cracking, ``probably Robin is the guy I enjoyed 
playing against the most.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To gain election, players had to be placed on 75 percent of the  
ballots cast by 10-year members of the Baseball Writers' 
Association of America. There were a record 497 ballots cast -- Ryan 
was named on a record 491, Brett 488 and Yount 385. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlton Fisk, another first-time candidate, fell 44 votes shy  
with 66.40 percent. Tony Perez missed in his eighth try with 302 
(60.76 percent). 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth, Ty Cobb, Walter Johnson, Honus Wagner and Christy  
Mathewson were taken in the first election ever. Since then, never 
more than two first-timers had been taken, the last time in 1990 
when Jim Palmer and Joe Morgan made it. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 29 rookie candidates have been taken since that first  
election. Mike Schmidt had been the last to do it in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe DiMaggio, Roy Campanella and Harmon Killebrew were among the  
players who did not get elected on the first try. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the BBWAA voted in three players overall was 1991  
-- Rod Carew, Ferguson Jenkins and Gaylord Perry. 
</P>
<P>
	Induction ceremonies at Cooperstown are scheduled for July 25.  
The Hall of Fame exhibition will be the next day, and it seems 
fitting that Ryan's Texas Rangers will take on Brett's Kansas City 
Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hall's membership of 240 probably will increase again on  
March 2 when the Veterans Committee votes in Tampa, Fla. Former 
manager Dick Williams, Bill Mazeroski, Orlando Cepeda and Dom 
DiMaggio figure to draw support. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan held or shared 53 major league records when he retired in  
1993 after a 27-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan went 324-292 for the New York Mets, California, Houston and  
Texas, tying him with Don Sutton for 12th in victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he never won a Cy Young Award, and despite his .526  
winning percentage ranking the lowest among all 300-game winners, 
Ryan's sheer domination landed him a place in the Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett was a 13-time All-Star. The third baseman hit .305 in a  
21-year career spent entirely with the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	Yount played his whole 20-year career with Milwaukee and won MVP  
awards at shortstop and center field. He was a three-time All-Star 
and batted .285. 
</P>
<P>
	Not since that 1936 election has a player with 3,000 hits failed  
to be elected in his first year of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisk (376 HRs) holds baseball's record for most home runs by a  
catcher. In 24 seasons, his most memorable homer was the one that 
won Game 6 of the 1975 World Series at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez, who got 68 percent last year, had 1,652 RBIs, most among  
eligible players not already in the Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Murphy, another first-timer, received 96 votes. The  
seven-time All-Star hit 398 home runs and won five straight Gold 
Gloves in center field. 
</P>
<P>
	Other players falling short included Gary Carter (168 votes),  
Steve Garvey (150), Jim Rice (146), Bruce Sutter (121) and Jim Kaat 
(100). 
</P>
<P>
	Mickey Lolich, 217-191 and MVP of the 1968 World Series, and  
Minnie Minoso, a .298 career hitter, missed in their 15th and final 
time on the ballot. Minoso got 73 votes and Lolich got 26. 
</P>
<P>
	Pete Rose, still off on the Hall ballot because of his ban from  
baseball, got 16 write-in votes.

<HEADLINE>  Ford Workers Pressure Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Nearly 3,000 workers at the Brazilian  
subsidiary of Ford Motor Co. ignored their pink slips and showed up 
for work on Tuesday to force the company to reconsider their 
dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 2,800 dismissed workers, together with the 3,700 who were  
not fired donned their overalls and peacefully entered the 
factory,'' shop steward Joao Rodrigues de Sousa told reporters. 
``However, they were unable to work because the company did not 
activate the assembly line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to show the company that we want to work and that it  
should discuss with us alternatives to the dismissals,'' Sousa 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's press office said the company would have no comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The Metalworkers Union in Sao Bernardo do Campo, the Sao Paulo  
industrial suburb where Ford's plant is located, said the 
alternatives could include a shorter work week, wage cuts and lower 
production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sousa criticized Ford for ``not making any effort at all to  
discuss ways to avoid the dismissal of workers who have nowhere 
else to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He cited the example of the local subsidiary of Volkswagen -- the  
country's largest automaker -- that recently averted the dismissal 
of close to 8,000 workers by reducing wages and the work week. 
</P>
<P>
	The company announced the dismissals on Dec. 18, saying they  
were necessary because of a ``drop in demand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They (the layoffs) are the only way to guarantee the continued  
viability of the organization,'' Ford said in a note distributed at 
the time. ``Sales have dropped 40 percent since the Asian crisis 
erupted in 1997 and no significant recovery is expected for the 
near future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's auto industry has seen sales plummet since the first  
effects of financial turmoil in Asia reached the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The hefty hikes in interest rates to protect the economy from  
currency speculators had a major impact in a market where nearly 70 
percent of auto sales are made on credit. After hitting a high of 
49.75 percent in September, interest rates were gradually lowered 
to their current level of about 29 percent a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest figures compiled by the National Association of  
Vehicle Manufacturers show that sales plunged 29 percent in the 
first 11 months of 1998 compared to the same period the previous 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Inventories of unsold cars today stand at some 200,000 vehicles  
parked in factory yards and on dealers' lots.

<HEADLINE>  Ford Workers Pressure Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Nearly 3,000 workers at the Brazilian  
subsidiary of Ford Motor Co. ignored their pink slips and showed up 
for work on Tuesday to force the company to reconsider their 
dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 2,800 dismissed workers, together with the 3,700 who were  
not fired donned their overalls and peacefully entered the 
factory,'' shop steward Joao Rodrigues de Sousa told reporters. 
``However, they were unable to work because the company did not 
activate the assembly line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to show the company that we want to work and that it  
should discuss with us alternatives to the dismissals,'' Sousa 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's press office said the company would have no comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The Metalworkers Union in Sao Bernardo do Campo, the Sao Paulo  
industrial suburb where Ford's plant is located, said the 
alternatives could include a shorter work week, wage cuts and lower 
production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sousa criticized Ford for ``not making any effort at all to  
discuss ways to avoid the dismissal of workers who have nowhere 
else to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He cited the example of the local subsidiary of Volkswagen -- the  
country's largest automaker -- that recently averted the dismissal 
of close to 8,000 workers by reducing wages and the work week. 
</P>
<P>
	The company announced the dismissals on Dec. 18, saying they  
were necessary because of a ``drop in demand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They (the layoffs) are the only way to guarantee the continued  
viability of the organization,'' Ford said in a note distributed at 
the time. ``Sales have dropped 40 percent since the Asian crisis 
erupted in 1997 and no significant recovery is expected for the 
near future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's auto industry has seen sales plummet since the first  
effects of financial turmoil in Asia reached the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The hefty hikes in interest rates to protect the economy from  
currency speculators had a major impact in a market where nearly 70 
percent of auto sales are made on credit. After hitting a high of 
49.75 percent in September, interest rates were gradually lowered 
to their current level of about 29 percent a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest figures compiled by the National Association of  
Vehicle Manufacturers show that sales plunged 29 percent in the 
first 11 months of 1998 compared to the same period the previous 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Inventories of unsold cars today stand at some 200,000 vehicles  
parked in factory yards and on dealers' lots.

<HEADLINE> AP Names Davis Top Offensive Player </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Terrell Davis, the backbone of Denver's defending NFL champions,  
was selected Tuesday as The Associated Press Offensive Player of 
the Year for the second time in three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, the fourth player to rush for more than 2,000 yards in a  
season, succeeds another 2,000-yard rusher, Detroit's Barry 
Sanders, in taking the award. He received 19 votes from a 
nationwide panel of 47 sports writers and broadcasters, beating 
Minnesota quarterback Randall Cunningham, who got 15 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels great to receive stuff like that,'' said Davis, the  
1998 Super Bowl MVP who helped the Broncos to a 14-2 record this 
year. ``With me, I don't go on the field striving to shoot for 
goals like that. But it's something that's definitely rewarding, 
when you go out there and you work hard and people recognize the 
hard work and effort you've put forth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The effort Davis put forth was memorable. He rushed for 2,008  
yards and 21 touchdowns, both league highs. He had two more scores 
on receptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' work sparked the Broncos to the AFC's most prolific  
offense, scoring 501 points. Denver also was 13-0 before losing two 
of its final three games, but finished with the conference's top 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, it's always an offensive goal or a team goal,'' the  
four-year pro said. ``When I receive something, I think everybody 
else should receive the same kind of accolades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fullback Howard Griffith, who does much of the blocking for  
Davis, also saw Davis' yardage as a team accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's really a tribute to the things he's done in the  
offseason to prepare himself for a stretch run,'' Griffith said of 
Davis' diligent offseason training. ``It's also a credit for the 
team to have played as hard as it played. It's not very often a 
team can go 14-2 and have a 2,000-yard rusher. Generally when 
there's a 2,000-yard rusher, you're right around the .500 mark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	None of the players receiving votes were on teams close to a  
break-even record. Cunningham, the All-Pro quarterback, led the NFL 
in passing while guiding the Vikings to a league-best 15-1 mark. 
Teammate Randy Moss, the Offensive Rookie of the Year and the most 
dangerous receiver in the game this season, drew six votes. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco quarterback Steve Young, the 1992 top offensive  
player, received two votes, as did Atlanta running back Jamal 
Anderson. New York Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde got one. 
</P>
<P>
	The only player from a losing team to earn votes was running  
back Marshall Faulk of the Indianapolis Colts (3-13), who got two. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis is the only Bronco ever to win the award. He is the ninth  
running back to take the honor, with only Sanders and Earl Campbell 
winning it more than once. Campbell was Offensive Player of the 
Year from 1978 through 1980.

<HEADLINE> Honesty Urged for Kids With HIV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Doctors and parents of children infected with the  
AIDS virus should tell them and not try to hide the diagnosis, the 
nation's leading group of pediatricians says. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's inevitable that the child will find out and the only  
question is, what's the timing that will be least harmful and most 
beneficial,'' said Dr. Alan Fleischman of the New York Academy of 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleischman is one of the authors of a policy statement from the  
American Academy of Pediatrics published in the January issue of 
the journal Pediatrics. 
</P>
<P>
	The 55,000-member group urged frankness toward HIV-infected  
children. It said doctors should try to work with the patient's 
parents to convince them their child should know the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	But it stopped short of saying doctors should tell the child  
over the parents' objections, unless the patient is a sexually 
active teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	The academy said the best way to tell the child is with both  
doctors and parents present. But it acknowledged some parents may 
want the doctor to break the news. 
</P>
<P>
	It said some doctors have often bowed to the wishes of parents  
who hope to keep youngsters from knowing they have HIV. The reasons 
include fear that their youngsters will lose their will to live, 
become angry with parents who infected them or disclose the 
information outside the family. 
</P>
<P>
	The academy has not previously taken a position on the issue.  
Doctors said the problem is becoming more serious as the number of 
youngsters with HIV grows and they live longer. 
</P>
<P>
	As of a year ago, there were more than 8,000 reported cases of  
AIDS in children under 13. The vast majority got the infection from 
their mothers at birth, and well over half remain alive, doctors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement cautioned that only preliminary research has been  
done on the effect of telling youngsters about their condition. But 
the pediatricians said an initial study shows that those who are 
told have higher self-esteem and parents who are candid with 
children are less likely to be depressed. 
</P>
<P>
	Health-care professionals who did not participate in writing the  
statement largely agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Time and time again we have seen that we think we are sparing  
the children from something and all we have done is make it more 
mysterious and more frightening because we were unwilling to talk 
about it,'' said Dr. Thomas DeStefani, chairman of pediatrics at 
Loyola University Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Hermann Mendez, a professor of pediatrics at the State  
University of New York at Brooklyn, echoed the statement's authors 
in saying that the time and manner of disclosure should match the 
patient's personality and readiness to know the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the child is unable to keep information that belongs in the  
family within the family, this could result in harm to the 
family,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said that teen-agers, who may be sexually active,  
must be told the truth to prevent spread of the infection. It said 
preschoolers are usually interested mainly in what will happen in 
their immediate future and don't necessarily need to hear the whole 
diagnosis.

<HEADLINE>  New Speaker Promises To Get To Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Dennis Hastert says his main goal when he  
is chosen speaker of the House is to end the political divisions 
that have held legislation hostage, and thereby restore the 
nation's faith in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Congress has to go to work, we have to start to produce  
good things that the American people want, policy that addresses 
the needs of the American people,'' the Illinois Republican said 
before a meeting with GOP leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's our first and most important step in restoring faith in  
this U.S. House of Representatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans will meet late today to choose Hastert, a  
little-known six-term lawmaker, to succeed Newt Gingrich as their 
leader. On Wednesday he is to be formally elected speaker with the 
convening of the 106th session of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert's surprise rise to the leadership spot followed  
Gingrich's decision to resign in the wake of Republican losses in 
the November elections and the announcement last month by 
Gingrich's expected successor, Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., that he 
had had extramarital affairs and would not seek the speakership. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert takes over a House deeply divided by the impeachment of  
President Clinton and paralyzed by partisan clashes. He pledged to 
reach out to Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things that I want to do is to open the  
possibilities for this House to work together. We need to work 
together, especially on very substantive issues, on a bipartisan 
basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that his top legislative goals include reforming Social  
Security and Medicare, improving the nation's education system, 
providing tax relief and boosting national defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will be me and I'm not going to try to emulate Newt or  
anybody else,'' Hastert, the 57-year-old former high school teacher 
said when asked how he would differ from the outspoken Gingrich. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to start our agenda now,'' he said. ``We intend not to  
talk about those issues but deliver.''

<HEADLINE> Brian Smith To Enter NFL Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Alabama-Birmingham linebacker Brian  
Smith is giving up his final year of eligibility to enter the NFL 
draft, the junior said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who is 6-foot-3 and 245-pounds, started all 33 games  
during his career at UAB and set a school record with 114 tackles 
in 1997. He finished with 248 tackles over his three-year career 
and was the quickest player in UAB history to reach 100 tackles 
when he did so in just 17 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he talked with Buffalo Bills cornerback Ken Irvin and  
Ray Donaldson, who played for the Dallas Cowboys, about the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``About a month ago I started weighing my options,'' Smith said.  
``It seems like a good opportunity. I feel like it's a good step 
for me right now and a chance to fulfill a childhood dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith is the first player in UAB's eight-year history of NCAA  
football to leave school early for the NFL draft.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that moved substantially Tuesday on the  
New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Stock Market, and American Stock 
Exchange. 

</P>
<P>
                               *NYSE    	

</P>
<P>
 *AirTouch Communications rose 9 1/4 to 77 1/2.  
</P>
<P>
 *Bell Atlantic rose 3 1/16 to 55.	
</P>
<P>
 *Vodafone's American Depository Receipts rose 4 1/2 to 179 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Britian's Vodafone PLC made a counteroffer for AirTouch,  
threatening to derail a $45 billion bid from Bell Atlantic Corp. 
The Wall Street Journal reported that Vodafone topped Bell 
Atlantic's proposal, but neither company would confirm the price. 
PaineWebber upraded Airtouch shares to ``buy'' from ``attractive.'' 

</P>
<P>
 *Storage Technology Corp. fell 93 3/4 cents to 33 1/2.    	
</P>
<P>
	The company expects to report fourth-quarter earnings of 50  
cents to 55 cents a share, below analysts' estimates of 73 cents. 
The stock fell as low as 29 1/8. For the fourth quarter of 1997, 
Storage Technology earned $83.7 million or $1.46 a diluted share, 
before a 2-for-1 stock split effective June 26, 1998. In a press 
release, Storage Technology said revenues will be below the $663.9 
million reported a year ago but higher than third-quarter revenues 
of $571.1 million. It said revenue from the new products was 
insufficient to offset an expected decline in sales from older 
products during the fourth quarter. 

</P>
<P>
 *Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. rose 4 5/8 to 73 1/8.  
</P>
<P>
 *Schwab Corp. fell 3/4 to 54 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Stanley Dean Witter upgraded Merrill's stock to  
``outperform'' from ``neutral'' and set a 12-month price target of 
$83 a share. Morgan said recent news stories saying that online 
trading had hurt Merrill's retail business were overblown. The firm 
questioned whether Schwab Corp. deserves a market capitalization 
larger than Merrill. Schwab's stock price had soared amid reports 
that online trading was on the rise. 

</P>
<P>
 *SAP AG's American Depository shares fell 2 1/2 to 32 1/16.    	
</P>
<P>
	The German software maker had a 15 percent pretax profit gain in  
1998, far below the 30 percent-to-35 percent increase it originally 
forecast. A dramatic slowdown in Japanese and Russian sales reduced 
expected fourth-quarter revenue by 240 million Deutsche marks, the 
company said. 

</P>
<P>
 *CBS Corp. rose 3/4 to 32 5/8.  
</P>
<P>
 *America Online fell 1 7/8 to 146 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies announced that CBS will supplant ABC as the  
exclusive broadcast news provider to America Online. The deal is a 
huge boost for CBS as it tries to catch rival news organizations 
that are more established on the Internet. 

</P>
<P>
 *NASDAQ   	

</P>
<P>
 *MCI WorldCom rose 5 1/16 to 74 15/16.    	
</P>
<P>
	Salomon Smith Barney raised its price target on the stock to 100  
from 80. A research note said the new target reflected a ``more 
appropriate multiple on forward earnings, given MCI WorldCom's 
stature as a true large-cap growth stock.'' 

</P>
<P>
 *Amazon.com rose 6 3/16 to 124 1/2.    	
</P>
<P>
	The Internet book seller's fourth-quarter sales more than  
tripled from a year ago, but the Seattle-based company said the big 
sales gains will not reduce its expected losses for the fourth 
quarter. Wall Street analysts estimate a loss of 56 cents a share 
for the period. Amazon.com's stock fell almost 10 percent in early 
trading before rebounding by mid-morning. 

</P>
<P>
 *Starbucks Corp. fell 1 7/8 to 52.    	
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle coffee-house chain said late Monday that December  
same-store sales rose 1 percent from a year ago. December total 
revenue rose 22 percent over last year. Total revenue growth and 
same-store sales growth were below recent trends. The company cited 
soft sales of retail holiday merchandise. 

</P>
<P>
 *AvTel Communications, Inc. rose 4 1/4 to 8 3/8.    	
</P>
<P>
	The company said its Addictive Media Group will introduce an  
array of multimedia and Internet services. The package will enhance 
the company's ability to develop linked multimedia CD-ROM products 
and Internet applications, as well as develop computer links from a 
consumer's home to Internet retail locations.

<HEADLINE> Mom of Wyo. Slay Suspect Found Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- The mother of a man charged in the beating  
death of gay college student Matthew Shepard apparently died of 
exposure along a rural road after staggering out of a downtown bar. 
</P>
<P>
	Cindy Thompson Dixon, 40, was found dead Sunday along a two-lane  
road north of town. Police questioned her husband but said there 
were no signs she had been beaten. The preliminary cause of death 
is hypothermia. 
</P>
<P>
	Her estranged husband, Charles E. Dixon Jr., has a history of  
spousal abuse and was charged with two counts of battery for 
allegedly beating Mrs. Dixon on Nov. 4. His preliminary hearing on 
the latest charges was postponed on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dixon was discovered by a passerby about 8:30 a.m. She was  
last seen about 7 p.m. Saturday stumbling from a bar in downtown 
Laramie about 12 miles from where her body was found, said Albany 
County Sheriff's Sgt. Rob Graham 
</P>
<P>
	In subzero wind chill, she was wearing a short, pink nylon  
jacket over a shirt and jeans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every indication was there will be some alcohol involved,  
which of course lowers your ability to handle cold air,'' Graham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say Ms. Dixon had no particular reason to be out on  
the road, a popular area for hikers and rock climbers. They believe 
she was driven to the area and was making her way back to town. She 
died about 1,000 feet from a house driveway. 
</P>
<P>
	Her son, Russell Arthur Henderson, is one of two men charged  
with Shepard's murder. He faces the death penalty if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson and Aaron McKinney are accused of beating and robbing  
Shepard, a University of Wyoming student, on Oct. 7 and tying him 
to a split-rail fence outside Laramie. Shepard, 21, suffered 18 
blows to the head and died five days after the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony at a November hearing indicated Shepard may have been  
targeted because he was gay. The attack brought condemnation from 
President Clinton and calls for tougher hate-crime laws. The men 
are scheduled to go on trial later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson never mentioned his mother, not even to friends he had  
known for 10 years. ``I asked him once where his parents were. He 
said his parents were dead,'' said Maggie McKinney, 23, who lived 
next door to Henderson.

<HEADLINE> Study: Women Using 'Date Rape Drug' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Nearly 6 percent of a group of sexually active  
young women say they deliberately take the drug Rohypnol, despite 
warnings that it can make them vulnerable to rape, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Rohypnol is known as a ``date rape drug'' because of cases in  
which women were assaulted after someone slipped it into their 
drink. Users have likened one tablet to drinking 12 beers. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at the University of Texas questioned 904 women ages  
14 to 26 who visited a Galveston family planning clinic, and found 
that 5.9 percent -- or 53 -- said they had taken flunitrazepam, the 
scientific name for Rohypnol, at least once. Six reported taking it 
more than 20 times. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was reported Tuesday in the journal Pediatrics.  
</P>

	The researchers and other experts said they suspect women try  
the drug because it is cheap, produces a drunken-like high and 
heightens the effects of other narcotics.

	``The media has been very clear about the dangers of this drug  
and yet teen-age girls, particularly the ones we studied, when they 
party and someone offers them something, they accept,'' Dr. Vaughn 
Rickert said. ``They are really leaving themselves open for 
assault.''

	Dr. Ron Charles, a professor at the University of Texas

	``I doubt that many people actually know what Rohypnol is. There  
are many street drugs that can be perceived as Rohypnol,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rohypnol is illegal in the United States but prescribed in  
Mexico and dozens of other countries for severe sleep disorders. In 
Mexican border towns, a tablet can sell for less than $1, meaning 
young people in Texas can get Rohypnol cheaply.

<TEXT>
<P>
	A glance at gubernatorial inaugurations today in Florida and in  
other states Monday: 

</P>
<P>
                             *FLORIDA   	
</P>
<P>
	Republican Jeb Bush became Florida's 43rd governor today during  
a bitterly cold outdoor inaugural ceremony attended by his parents, 
George and Barbara Bush, and brother, Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	The wind chill was only 11 degrees as the new governor described  
himself as ``really blessed to have the most incredible family in 
the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He promised at an inauguration party Monday to always root for  
any state team vying for a national championship. It didn't help, 
as the No. 2 Florida State Seminoles lost college football's Fiesta 
Bowl to the top-ranked Tennessee Volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                             *ARIZONA   	
</P>
<P>
	Arizona became the first state with an all-female line of  
succession. Republican Gov. Jane Hull took the oath from Supreme 
Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and was followed by Secretary of 
State Betsey Bayless, Attorney General Janet Napolitano, Treasurer 
Carol Springer and Superintendent of Public Instruction Lisa Graham 
Keegan. Arizona has no lieutenant governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hull, who served the final 16 months of Fife Symington's  
term after he was convicted of loan fraud, said her priorities 
include lower taxes, the environment, health care and year 2000 
computer woes. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                            *CALIFORNIA   	
</P>
<P>
	Gray Davis, a Democrat, reaffirmed his commitment to education  
and abortion rights and promised to lead from the center. ``We will 
revive the sense of unlimited possibility and common purpose that 
once made California the envy of the world,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Gov. Jerry Brown, a three-time presidential candidate,  
returned to public office when he was sworn in as Oakland mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                              *IDAHO   	
</P>
<P>
	Republican Dirk Kempthorne, a former U.S. senator, pledged to  
exercise the power that Congress has given back to the states. He 
reserved other details for his formal inauguration Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                            *MINNESOTA   	
</P>
<P>
	Jesse Ventura capped his stunning rise from ex-professional  
wrestler. The Reform Party candidate doled out thank-yous and 
talked about his hopes but did not touch on any plans he might have 
for tax relief, a central theme of his campaign. He planned to be 
in the governor's office today to work on the state's two-year, $23 
billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                              *NEVADA   	
</P>
<P>
	Republican Kenny Guinn promised to give his best in dealing with  
big issues facing the state -- including a budget shortfall that 
could hit $135 million. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                            *WISCONSIN   	
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Tommy Thompson, a potential GOP presidential candidate in  
2000, began his fourth four-year term, which he has said will be 
his last. The state's longest-serving governor said his goals 
include making health care accessible to all families and 
overhauling state programs that provide long-term care for the 
elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                             *WYOMING   	
</P>
<P>
	Republican Gov. Jim Geringer donned a black cowboy hat as he  
climbed the steps of the Capitol to be sworn in for a second 
four-year term. In his speech, Geringer briefly covered various 
issues before the state, including the economy, education and 
health care. ``I won't cover everything -- just enough what your 
backside can stand,'' he said.

	Clinton Lawyers May Target Evidence  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Advisers say President Clinton's defense team  
is preparing an elaborate attack against evidence gathered by 
Kenneth Starr if the impeachment case goes before a full Senate 
trial. Aides familiar with strategy sessions say an opening 
presentation would target House conclusions that Clinton committed 
perjury and obstructed justice in an attempt to conceal an 
extramarital affair. Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., 
today reiterated his party's desire to see a truncated trial. 

</P>
<P>
	Bitter Cold Settles in After Storm  
</P>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- This usually snow-savvy city was paralyzed  
again today after a storm dumped up to 15 inches of the white stuff 
on parts of the region yesterday. Schools are closed again as 
several more inches of snow are forecast. Yesterday's storm was the 
latest blow in the arctic blast that began over the weekend and has 
left much of the Midwest and New England under up to 2 feet of 
snow. It has also plunged the eastern two-thirds of the nation into 
a deep freeze. Temperatures were in the teens across much of the 
South early today and school was canceled as far south as Oklahoma. 
At least 60 deaths have been blamed on the weather, many of them 
from traffic accidents. 

</P>
<P>
	Congress To Name New Speaker  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans will meet late today to  
choose Rep. Dennis Hastert, a little-known six-term lawmaker, to 
succeed Newt Gingrich as their leader. Hastert's rise to the 
leadership spot followed Gingrich's decision to resign in the wake 
of Republican losses in the November elections and the announcement 
last month by Gingrich's expected successor, Rep. Bob Livingston, 
R-La., that he had had extramarital affairs and would not seek the 
speakership. 

</P>
<P>
	US To Allow More Contact With Cuba  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is planning measures to  
increase contact between Cubans and Americans, including cash 
transfers, limited food sales and a direct mail service. Although a 
senior administration official insisted none of the initiatives 
involve any softening of the three-decade trade embargo on Fidel 
Castro's Cuba. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., said the measures 
were part of an administration attempt to mask its ``true intention 
of normalizing relations with the Cuban dictator.'' 

</P>
<P>
	US Chided Over Bin Laden Obsession  
</P>
<P>
	KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- The newspaper of Afghanistan's ruling  
Taliban chided the United States today for what it called 
Washington's obsession with Osama bin Laden, the main suspect in 
last summer's U.S. embassy bombings. ``America is a superpower, 
with a strong economy and a strong political system, so why does it 
have such an obsession for a person who is very weak?'' the Shariat 
newspaper said. Bin Laden has been indicted by a U.S. court in 
connection with the August bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and 
Tanzania. He lives in exile in Afghanistan under the Taliban's 
protection. 

</P>
<P>
	Mom of Suspect in Gay Slaying Dead  
</P>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- The death of a woman whose son is charged  
in the fatal beating of a gay college student is being investigated 
as a possible murder, authorities said. The body of Cindy Thompson 
Dixon was found Sunday on a road about five miles north of the 
city, officials said. Preliminary autopsy results revealed she died 
of hypothermia, but police said the woman's death appeared 
suspicious. Dixon was the mother of Russell Henderson, one of two 
suspects awaiting trial in the fatal beating of University of 
Wyoming student Matthew Shepard. 

</P>
<P>
	Orangutans Suffer From Too Much TV  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- A plan to educate a group of orangutans on the  
joys of family life by watching television backfired after the apes 
became more interested in the tube than each other, The Moscow 
Times reported today. The newspaper said the male orangutan became 
so engrossed in watching TV that he started to ignore his mate, who 
became upset over his neglect. The zoo director said the apes will 
have some of their TV privileges reduced. 

</P>
<P>
	Japanese Stock Prices Plunge  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese share prices plunged for the second day in  
a row today as the dollar's weakness against the yen sent 
export-sensitive stocks tumbling. The Nikkei shed 183.15 points to 
close at 13,232.74. 

</P>
<P>
	Tennessee 23, Florida State 16  
</P>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Tennessee won college football's national  
championship and completed a 13-0 season last night with a 23-16 
victory over Florida State. Quarterback Tee Martin threw two 
touchdown passes, including a 79-yarder to star receiver Peerless 
Price. The Volunteers received all 70 first-place votes in the 
final Associated Press media poll. Ohio State was second, followed 
by Florida State.

	Group Denies Helping Kosovo Rebels

<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A prominent international  
humanitarian group denied allegations that it is supplying arms to 
ethnic Albanian rebels battling for independence in Kosovo. Bas 
Tielens, a spokesman for the group, Doctors Without Borders, said 
yesterday that Serb accusations that the group is helping Kosovo 
Albanian guerrillas are unfounded and came ``out of the blue.'' 
Earlier yesterday, Vukasin Andric, health secretary for Kosovo, had 
said that members of the Paris-based group were ``caught hiding and 
smuggling weapons for Albanian terrorists.'' In a statement carried 
by the independent Beta news agency, Andric did not provide details 
to back up his accusation.

	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- The prosecution in the sex and  
corruption trial of former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim 
rested its case today, paving the way for defense lawyers to call 
their own witnesses. In a related development, the country's top 
legal officer confirmed what people already knew: that police beat 
Anwar on the night of his dramatic arrest. It was the first time 
that the government has admitted that Anwar's bruises and a severe 
black eye was caused by a police beating on Sept. 20. Anwar faces a 
total 10 counts of illegal sex and corruption charges.

the November elections and the announcement last month by 
Gingrich's expected successor, Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., that he

touchdown passes of 79 yards to Peerless Price and 4 yards to Shawn 
Bryson to cap the Volunteers' perfect season with a 23-16 Fiesta 
Bowl win last night. The Volunteers, 13-0 for the first time in 
school history, received all 70 first-place votes in the final

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While vowing unbending hostility toward the

significant expansion of cash transfers from private Americans to 
needy Cubans. The proposals also contemplate U.S. food sales to 
Cuba on a limited basis for the first time as well as direct mail 
service and an expansion of direct charter flights. A formal White 
House announcement was expected today. After officials disclosed

<HEADLINE> Niners Facing Road Test at Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Wins on the road have been hard to  
come by for the San Francisco 49ers and even tougher to get against 
winning teams. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a trend they'll have to reverse if they hope to extend  
their season beyond Saturday's divisional playoff at Atlanta, which 
supplanted the 49ers as NFC West champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We definitely want to get the upper hand early, just so you  
can quiet things down a little bit,'' San Francisco quarterback 
Steve Young said Tuesday. ``That goes without saying. You want to 
try to eliminate some of the emotional highs early in the game that 
can get the crowd fired up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco (13-4) and Atlanta (14-2) split the regular season  
series, with each team winning at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't play very well there,'' 49ers coach Steve Mariucci  
said. ``Maybe there was a game or two where we played worse than 
that. Here, we played them extremely well. We were up on them 
31-7.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers coasted to a 31-20 victory at San Francisco on Sept.  
27, but the Falcons got the upper hand in the Nov. 15 rematch at 
the Georgia Dome, winning 31-19. 
</P>
<P>
	The split reflects the way San Francisco has played this season.  
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers were unbeaten at home, including Sunday's thrilling  
30-27 wild-card victory over Green Bay that sent San Francisco to 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	On the road, the 49ers are 0-4 against playoff teams this  
season. The 49ers haven't beaten a winning team on the road since a 
25-15 decision at Pittsburgh on Dec. 15, 1996, and haven't won away 
from home in the postseason since a 28-3 victory at Chicago in the 
NFC championship on Jan. 8, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's because our opponents have been very good,'' Mariucci  
said. ``But our young guys are growing up. It was a tremendous 
experience for our young guys, to go through a game like that 
(Sunday's win over Green Bay). We grew up a lot. Me, too. Maybe, 
we'll be more ready for a playoff game on the road. We just have to 
play better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco defensive tackle Brentson Buckner said the Falcons  
have developed a winning attitude at home, and it showed the last 
time the teams met. Atlanta's victory snapped a five-game losing 
streak against San Francisco in front of the first sellout crowd at 
the Georgia Dome since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had that look in their eyes like, `We're in our own  
backyard. We're going to do what it takes to win,' and they just 
kept doing it,'' Buckner said. ``The more success they had, the 
more it built their confidence. They're on top of their game right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco will have to contend with another capacity crowd  
at the Georgia Dome on Saturday. To help get ready, the 49ers have 
installed huge speakers to blare music as they practice this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the crowd will be geeked up,'' Atlanta safety Eugene  
Robinson. ``For them, the 49ers have always been on top. Now that 
we have a chance to be on top, the fans are basking in the glory. 
The players are like, `We have the monkey off our back.' But we 
don't get credit for winning the game early. We get credit for 
winning this game. This is the most important game we have. It's 
going to be an all-out war.''

<HEADLINE>  Vols' Hometown Fans Celebrate Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee's hometown fans broke out  
victory cigars and cheered from the tops of tables as they 
celebrated a 23-16 victory over Florida State for the national 
championship in the Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was great,'' shouted Jim Schutt, who donned a  
sweatshirt saying the Vols are ``Undefeated, Unbeatable and 
Uncontested!'' as he celebrated with others who had watched the 
game at Bailey's Sports Grille. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are No. 1. There's no question about it,'' he said as fans  
slapped high-fives. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans huddled around TVs at home and in bars Monday night as  
temperatures dipped into the teens. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want some reaction?'' said Eddie Bailey, as he shouted  
``Oh, yeah! The Vols are No. 1 and that's what it's all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We needed some respect and we've got it,'' said his friend,  
Laura Westbrook. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoxville restaurateur Frank Goddard said the Fiesta Bowl  
matchup between No. 1 Tennessee and No. 2 Florida State was '' ... 
a big, big day in the life of anybody who is a UT graduate, which I 
am, or a UT fan, which I am,'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been around Tennessee football all my life and I can't  
remember a bigger event,'' said Goddard, whose father played on 
Tennessee's 1951 championship team. ``Maybe the World's Fair (held 
in Knoxville in 1982). Maybe, but I doubt it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The impact wasn't confined to Knoxville. Gov. Don Sundquist, as  
well as Knoxville Mayor Victor Ashe, were among the thousands who 
traveled to the game in Tempe. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL's Nashville Predators moved up the starting time two  
hours for their game against the Anaheim Mighty Ducks, then showed 
the Fiesta Bowl on their Jumbotron. 
</P>
<P>
	It's ``an unofficial state holiday for all intents and  
purposes,'' reasoned Tom Ward, the Predators' executive vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	With UT students on Christmas break until Jan. 13 and thousands  
of Tennessee fans at the game, the Vols' hometown was strangely 
quiet on game day. But the stay-at-home faithful made plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Some restaurants closed, saying they couldn't compete against  
the telecast. The ``Naples'' restaurant gave employees the day off 
and left a recorded message on their phone, ``Go Vols.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goddard said his company closed their ``Harry's'' restaurant for  
the day ``due to the tremendous following to Tempe. Most of our 
regulars said they would see us when they return with the national 
championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Goddard said his flagship ``Regas'' restaurant, which  
seats 500, was booked by a ``preferred guest'' for a Fiesta Bowl 
party for 50 of his closest friends. ``They said they didn't care 
what it cost,'' Goddard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pizza delivery services expected a booming business. James  
Bluford, an area manager for Pizza Hut, expected it to ``be as big 
as the Super Bowl, if not bigger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Vol fans began filling Bailey's Sports Grille hours before  
kickoff to watch the game on one of 23 TVs. ``Just the normal UT 
game, just the normal madness,'' manager Jacqueline Teed-Freisen 
said.

</P>
<P>
	Fans huddled around TVs at home and in bars Monday night as  
temperatures dipped into the teens. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want some reaction?'' said Eddie Bailey, as he shouted  
``Oh, yeah! The Vols are No. 1 and that's what it's all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We needed some respect and we've got it,'' said his friend,  
Laura Westbrook. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoxville restaurateur Frank Goddard said the Fiesta Bowl  
matchup between No. 1 Tennessee and No. 2 Florida State was '' ... 
a big, big day in the life of anybody who is a UT graduate, which I 
am, or a UT fan, which I am,'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been around Tennessee football all my life and I can't  
remember a bigger event,'' said Goddard, whose father played on 
Tennessee's 1951 championship team. ``Maybe the World's Fair (held 
in Knoxville in 1982). Maybe, but I doubt it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The impact wasn't confined to Knoxville. Gov. Don Sundquist, as  
well as Knoxville Mayor Victor Ashe, were among the thousands who 
traveled to the game in Tempe. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL's Nashville Predators moved up the starting time two  
hours for their game against the Anaheim Mighty Ducks, then showed 
the Fiesta Bowl on their Jumbotron. 
</P>
<P>
	It's ``an unofficial state holiday for all intents and  
purposes,'' reasoned Tom Ward, the Predators' executive vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	With UT students on Christmas break until Jan. 13 and thousands  
of Tennessee fans at the game, the Vols' hometown was strangely 
quiet on game day. But the stay-at-home faithful made plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Some restaurants closed, saying they couldn't compete against  
the telecast. The ``Naples'' restaurant gave employees the day off 
and left a recorded message on their phone, ``Go Vols.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goddard said his company closed their ``Harry's'' restaurant for  
the day ``due to the tremendous following to Tempe. Most of our 
regulars said they would see us when they return with the national 
championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Goddard said his flagship ``Regas'' restaurant, which  
seats 500, was booked by a ``preferred guest'' for a Fiesta Bowl 
party for 50 of his closest friends. ``They said they didn't care 
what it cost,'' Goddard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pizza delivery services expected a booming business. James  
Bluford, an area manager for Pizza Hut, expected it to ``be as big 
as the Super Bowl, if not bigger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Vol fans began filling Bailey's Sports Grille hours before  
kickoff to watch the game on one of 23 TVs. ``Just the normal UT 
game, just the normal madness,'' manager Jacqueline Teed-Freisen 
said.

<HEADLINE> Starr's Secrecy Request Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge has rejected Independent Counsel  
Kenneth Starr's request to maintain the secrecy of court documents 
showing that two of President Clinton's top aides were not in 
jeopardy of being prosecuted in the Monica Lewinsky case. 
</P>
<P>
	In a ruling made public Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Norma  
Holloway Johnson said there was no need to keep confidential the 
documents showing White House aides Bruce Lindsey and Sidney 
Blumenthal were only fact witnesses and never targets for 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	Documents Starr had made public to Congress already had divulged  
that fact, the judge said. The ruling does not state why Starr 
wanted to keep the information secret. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson also ordered the release later this week of additional  
documents from the investigation into whether Starr's office 
illegally leaked grand jury evidence from the Lewinsky probe to the 
news media. 
</P>
<P>
	Those documents show among other things that on Oct. 30 the  
judge rejected an appeal from Starr to reconsider her earlier 
ruling ordering his prosecutors to attend a hearing and prove they 
weren't the source of news media leaks about the Lewinsky case. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr denied such leaks, but Johnson had concluded there was  
circumstantial evidence that at least two dozens such leaks could 
have come from Starr's office and that further investigation was 
warranted. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaks probe continues even though the Lewinsky grand jury  
investigation has ended and the evidence has now been made public 
as part of the impeachment proceedings against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court will unseal these papers because continued secrecy  
is not necessary to prevent disclosure of matters occurring before 
the grand jury,'' the judge said in the ruling made public Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a lengthy footnote in the ruling, she rejected the request  
from Starr's office that ``all references to the target/nontarget 
status'' of Blumenthal and Lindsey be kept secret when the new 
court documents are released. 
</P>
<P>
	A target is someone who has been informed by prosecutors that  
they are likely to be indicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson noted, however, that in grand jury transcripts turned  
over to Congress during the impeachment debate last fall, 
prosecutors were quoted as telling Lindsey and Blumenthal they were 
not targets, just witnesses, called before the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Because those transcripts are already public, ``the court finds  
that such redaction is unnecessary in this case,'' Johnson wrote.

<HEADLINE>  James To Leave Miami for NFL Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) -- Edgerrin James, the University of  
Miami's record-setting running back, said Tuesday he will pass up 
his senior season to enter the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	James set a single-season rushing record with 1,416 yards and 19  
touchdowns during the regular season. He is only one of three Miami 
backs to rush for more than 1,000 yards and the only one to do it 
in consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought this was an opportunity I should go for right now,''  
the 20-year-old James told reporters. ``Just thinking how the 
season went, this year was the right time. Things have turned out 
real well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James said he expects to be a first-round pick.  
</P>
<P>
	The junior from Immokalee, Fla., helped his cause when he ran  
for a school-record 299 yards and three touchdowns in Miami's 49-45 
upset of UCLA on Dec. 5 in the Orange Bowl. His stock improved 
among NFL scouts with his 156-yard performance in Miami's 46-23 win 
over North Carolina State in the Micron PC Bowl on Dec. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	James, 6-foot-1 and 220 pounds, set a school record with 14  
100-yard games, including six in a row to end the 1998 season. He 
tied the school record with 35 career touchdowns.

<HEADLINE> Falcons' Reeves Is In Charge Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- Dan Reeves made it clear Tuesday: He's back  
in charge of the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	Just three weeks after heart bypass surgery, the Falcons coach  
resumed his normal routine. He held a briefing for the media, 
reclaimed his coaching duties in practice and made plans to be on 
the sidelines for Saturday's divisional playoff game against the 
San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Y'all missed me, didn't you?'' Reeves quipped as he took his  
place behind the podium for the first time since quadruple bypass 
surgery on Dec. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves missed the final two regular-season games for the NFC  
West champion Falcons (14-2), trying to reach the conference final 
for the first time in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, he began viewing some film and sat in on meetings  
with the players and coaches. But defensive coordinator Rich 
Brooks, the acting head coach, continued to run the team in 
practice while Reeves watched from his office. 
</P>
<P>
	When Reeves strode to the podium for his weekly news conference  
-- a duty handled by Brooks since the operation -- it was apparent 
things were back to normal. The only question is where Reeves will 
be for the playoff game: his regular spot on the sidelines or the 
press box coaching booth. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is to try to be on the sideline,'' he said. ``I think  
I'll have a better idea after we go through three days of practice 
-- how much energy I have at practice, how much I'll be able to 
stand up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves and his team escaped the unseasonably cold temperatures  
in Atlanta by practicing indoors at the Georgia Dome. He said it 
was easier to concentrate in warmer surroundings, but the move also 
allowed him to take part without fear of illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing a gray sweatshirt and black sweatpants, Reeves casually  
strolled around the field during most of the practice, blowing his 
whistle and barking instructions. The only concession to his 
condition came during individual drills, when he sat down on the 
bench for about 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm better than I thought I would be,'' he said. ``It was  
great to be back on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves received a clean bill of health during an examination  
Monday, although he is still taking blood thinner medication to 
help with his recovery. He is working out twice a day for 15 
minutes on a treadmill, which has helped his energy level. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you think about what he's gone through, it's amazing that  
he's planning to join us as quickly as it has been,'' quarterback 
Chris Chandler said. ``When you think about all we've got to do is 
play a football game and he went through major heart surgery, I 
think it gives us a lot of motivation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the players would like to have Reeves on the sideline for  
the playoffs, they are more concerned about his health. The 
consensus seemed to be that he should work in the press box instead 
of subjecting himself to possible injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always nice to see him coming off the field and see him  
before you go in there for a series,'' Chandler said. ``There's no 
doubt that having him on the field is just kind of comforting for 
me. I'd like to see him down there. 
</P>
<P>
	``But with what's going on with him and the risk factor of being  
down on the sideline, it's best that he probably not be down 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback Ray Buchanan echoed those sentiments.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be very emotional to have him back. At the same  
time, Dan has to be very careful with his heart condition in a 
playoff atmosphere,'' Buchanan said. ``Some of the players said 
they'd rather have him up in the press box. We can feel his 
presence whenever we go out on the field, even if he's not there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves already has returned to the hospital once with an  
accelerated heartbeat, apparently because he tried to rush his 
recovery. But he isn't worried about another setback. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctors tell me to go be myself,'' he said. ``My heart's  
in good shape. I'm not going to go out there screaming and 
everything. Well, maybe sometimes. But hopefully I will be a little 
bit more under control ... and do the things I've always done.''

<HEADLINE> Police Arrest Suspected Nev. Sniper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Police arrested a man they called a  
``goofball'' in connection with a highway sniper attack, saying 
today that he shot at motorists on Interstate 80 so he could rob 
them after they crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not talking about a rocket ship commander,'' Washoe  
County Sheriff Richard Kirkland said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Six vehicles were hit by Monday's gunfire west of Reno, and one  
man was wounded in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Merritt, 20, of Mankato, Minn., was arrested Monday  
night in Las Vegas following a routine traffic stop, Kirkland said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was being returned to Reno to face felony counts of attempted  
murder, firing into a vehicle, battery with a deadly weapon and 
assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Merritt was pulled over for having a burned out taillight and a  
check showed the truck had been stolen from Fairfax, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkland said the arresting officers found a rifle and a shotgun  
in vehicle and Merritt made statements that connected him to the 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunfire forced authorities to close the busy highway between  
Reno and the California state line for about five hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``The motive of the crime as represented to our officers was to  
shoot people in their cars, have them crash, then run to the crash 
site and rob them,'' Kirkland said. ``He was frustrated because 
people would drive on a ways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff said no link had been established between Monday's  
shootings and the Dec. 27 discovery of 34 stray horses shot to 
death east of Reno, but nothing was being ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got a goofball shooting at people and an equally  
goofball shooting at horses so obviously it would lead you to ask 
if there is some connection there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The wounded man was able to drive himself to a fire station a  
few miles away, and was expected to be released from Washoe Medical 
Center as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
	At least two other people were injured by flying glass.  
</P>
<P>
	``The window kind of exploded. I heard a loud pop, glass  
shattered in my face,'' said Carl Ruggiero, a Reno dentist. ``I 
thought I got hit by a rock from a truck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In two cases, bullets traveled ``right through the center of the  
windshield between the seats,'' Towery said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Children at three schools in the area were kept indoors and  
afternoon kindergarten was canceled at one elementary school.

<HEADLINE> Hogs, Cattle Futures Prices Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Hog and cattle futures prices rose sharply Tuesday on the  
Chicago Mercantile Exchange as the market reacted to fears the cold 
gripping the Midwest and the Plains states will adversely affect 
livestock. 
</P>
<P>
	The markets fear a lingering Arctic blast will cause cattle and  
hogs to use most of their energy staying warm instead of growing, 
resulting in smaller animals going to market. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, sugar futures prices surged, precious metal  
futures were mixed and grain and soybean futures rose. 
</P>
<P>
	The cattle and hog markets rose on fears the weekend's heavy  
snowfall and the frigid temperatures that followed represented a 
change in the weather pattern, analysts said. That perception was 
reinforced by forecasts of more snow for the coming weekend, 
followed by another blast of frigid air. 
</P>
<P>
	Until last week, mild temperatures dominated in the nation's  
major cattle and hog producing regions, allowing livestock to grow, 
according to analyst Charles Levitt of Alaron Trading Corp. The 
weekend's storm as first was viewed as a minor hitch in the 
movement of cattle and hogs to market. 
</P>
<P>
	But the forecasts for more snow and cold has made the market  
jittery. Long periods of cold will mean the animals will stop 
gaining weight because the nourishment from feed primarily will be 
used to keep their bodies warm and healthy, according to Levitt. 
</P>
<P>
	``That changes the production scenario,'' he said. ``The market  
had gotten used to large tonnage coming into the pipeline (for 
processing).'' 
</P>
<P>
	February live cattle were 1.05 cents higher at 60.67 cents a  
pound; January feeder cattle were 1.50 cents higher at 70.17 cents 
a pound; lean hogs were 2 cents higher at 32.72 cents a pound; 
February pork bellies were 1.28 cents higher at 44.05 cents a 
pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar futures prices surged on New York's Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa  
Exchange on talk that several nations, including Russia and 
Indonesia, are about to enter the market to make major sugar 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	However, with the market rally this week, the possibility exists  
that those potential customers may decide not to buy, said analyst 
Judith Ganes of Merrill Lynch, who added the news driving the 
market has been the same for weeks with little effect on prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The surge of sugar prices also was attributed to technical  
factors, including the oversold condition of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar for March delivery was .56 cent higher at 8.74 cents a  
pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Precious metal futures prices, led by platinum and palladium,  
fell on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Platinum and palladium futures prices fell in the wake of news  
that South Africa's Anglo American Platinum Corp. has reached a 
wage settlement with the National Union of Mineworkers. The 
company's five mines have been shut down for 12 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold futures were pulled lower by the weakness of platinum and  
palladium, while silver futures surged on fund buying. 
</P>
<P>
	January platinum was $6.70 lower at $357.10 a troy ounce; March  
palladium was $10.70 lower at $328.75 cents a troy ounce. February 
gold was 50 cents lower at $286.90 a troy ounce; January silver was 
10.2 cents higher at $5.004 a troy ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures prices settled higher on the Chicago  
Board of Trade, with corn boosted by expectations of increased 
demand by livestock producers for feed grain. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures prices were boosted by forecasts of dry weather  
for Argentina and southern Brazil. While the market is moving 
higher because of the forecasts, the lack of rain in the region is 
not having an adverse impact on the soybean crop. Although no rain 
has fallen in a week and none is forecast for at least five days, 
subsoil moisture remains adequate. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery settled 1 1/4 cents higher at $2.80 1/4 a  
bushel; March corn was 2 1/2 cents higher at $2.17 1/4 a bushel; March 
oats were 1 1/4 cents higher at $1.08 3/4 a bushel; January soybeans were 
5 1/2 cents higher at $5.49 1/4 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Subway Death Leads to Murder Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When Andrew Goldstein pushed a woman inside a  
bookstore so violently that she cut her face, police issued him a 
desk appearance ticket and called the incident a nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
	That was in 1997, and police didn't know then what they know now  
-- that Goldstein was schizophrenic. Now, Goldstein, 29, is charged 
with murder for allegedly pushing a woman in front of a subway 
train on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of the victim, Kendra Webdale, 32, was flown home to  
upstate New York on Tuesday for burial on Thursday. Ms. Webdale 
moved to New York City two years ago to pursue a career in 
screenwriting. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstein's arrest has renewed calls for change in the way the  
city and state treat the mentally ill. Some mental health experts 
want a measure that would force mentally ill people to take 
medication or risk involuntary hospitalization. Others want police 
better trained to handle such people. 
</P>
<P>
	Under state law, people must be deemed both mentally ill and a  
danger to themselves or others before they can be involuntarily 
admitted into a hospital or institution. And police, when handling 
mentally ill people, are not required to call for medical help, 
though they often do, said Inspector Michael Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstein, who is being held without bail, is among thousands of  
mentally ill inmates in New York state. Heather Barr, a staff 
attorney at the Urban Justice Center, said 7 to 8 percent of state 
prisoners are mentally ill. They receive minimal help, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police believe Goldstein acted randomly. Court-appointed  
attorney Kevin Canfield said Goldstein suffers from schizophrenia 
and had not taken his medication on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	That would have affected Goldstein's ability to think  
rationally, said Dr. E. Fuller Torrey, who has researched 
schizophrenia, a psychotic disorder that affects the brain, for 
more than 20 years.

<HEADLINE> Euro Continues Strong on Day 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                       *By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW    	
</P>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Europe's new currency, the euro,  
continued trading strongly today, though a market surge that 
greeted its smooth birth appeared to taper off as opening day 
excitement subsided. 
</P>
<P>
	In late trading, Frankfurt's main stock index was flat after  
rocketing 5 percent Monday on what many traders dubbed 
``Euro-phoria.'' Shares in Paris rose 1.3 percent. In London, which 
lagged behind Monday's strong gains in many European markets, 
shares also rose 1.3 percent. Britain is not initially taking part 
in the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro continued to trade strongly at $1.1776, above its  
launch level of $1.1668. 
</P>
<P>
	``The euro passed its first big test on foreign and German  
markets with flying colors,'' government spokeswoman Charima 
Reinhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Signs of the euro's growing reality were everywhere, big and  
small. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brussels, the executive Commission of the European Union said  
it had signed an agreement with 12 international banks to raise up 
to 2 billion euros ($2.4 billion) in euro-denominated bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, Joseph Yam, chief of the quasi central bank, the  
Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said the bank may convert more of its 
$88 billion in foreign exchange reserves into euros, in a sign of 
interest in the currency as an alternative to the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	In Italy, senator Felice Besostri of the Democratic Left party  
tested the euro, saying he'd asked for a euro checkbook from his 
bank and gotten one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was curious and wanted to verify that it was possible,'' he  
was quoted as saying. ``Everything worked perfectly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officially, the euro launched Jan. 1 when conversion rates  
against the 11 participating European currencies were fixed. While 
the euro will not be in consumers' pockets until 2002, it now can 
be used for non-cash, credit card or traveler check purchases. Many 
major firms are converting their transactions to euros, as well. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> IRS Evaluations Emphasize Attitudes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- IRS employees would be measured more by how  
taxpayers feel they've been treated than by how much money is 
collected under worker performance rules proposed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules were developed after Congress last year ordered the  
Internal Revenue Service, as part of a major reform law, to halt 
use of tax enforcement records to evaluate employees or to impose 
quotas for them to meet. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be a substantial change,'' said Robert Tobias,  
president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which includes 
IRS personnel. ``The IRS will focus on the quality of the work it 
produces in terms of customer satisfaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite years of criticism, an IRS inspector general's report  
concluded in August that employees were still evaluated mainly on 
the dollars collected and other enforcement actions -- not on 
``quality casework, adherence to the law and protection of taxpayer 
rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new employee measures would cover three broad areas:  
customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction and business results 
that specifically exclude such enforcement actions as dollar 
amounts, number of liens imposed and number of referrals for 
criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti said in a written description  
of the rules released Tuesday that they would, for the first time, 
establish ``fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers as one of the 
standards for evaluating employees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To do so, the IRS would poll a sample of taxpayers who have  
contact with the agency to determine if they were treated properly, 
informed of their rights and given adequate time to respond to IRS 
requests. These responses would be used to develop satisfaction 
goals by which employees will be measured. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, Tobias said, a revenue agent collecting back taxes  
might not help the taxpayer get things straightened out for the 
current tax year because it would have taken too much time. Under 
the new rules, that agent could be rewarded for providing the help. 
</P>
<P>
	``The employees have always wanted to serve the taxpayers, but  
the rules have hindered them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed rules also would measure employee satisfaction  
through anonymous questionnaires on such issues as quality of 
supervision and whether enough training is provided. 
</P>
<P>
	Business results would also make use of samples, focusing  
attention on particular IRS units and determining performance on a 
range of factors including how the law was applied and whether 
taxpayer rights were protected. 
</P>
<P>
	Those factors would include ``neutral'' measures such as the  
number of cases closed and time spent per case, but not in setting 
goals for rank-and-file employees directly involved in tax 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed regulations will be discussed at a May 13 public  
hearing at IRS headquarters here. They are likely to become final 
later this year.

<HEADLINE> Niners Road Woes a Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- San Francisco coach Steve Mariucci  
spent time reviewing films of the 49ers' two games against Atlanta 
this season and saw the best and worst of his team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't play very well there,'' Mariucci said Tuesday as the  
49ers (13-4) began preparing for Saturday's divisional playoff at 
Atlanta (14-2). ``I mean, maybe there was a game or two where we 
played worse than that. I don't know. Here, we played them 
extremely well. I mean, we were up on them 31-7.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers coasted to a 31-20 victory at San Francisco on Sept.  
27 but the Falcons got the upper hand in the Nov. 15 rematch at the 
Georgia Dome, winning 31-19. 
</P>
<P>
	And in a way, the regular season split reflected the way San  
Francisco has played this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers haven't lost this year at home and advanced to the  
divisional playoff by beating Green Bay in thrilling fashion 30-27 
in Sunday's NFC wild-card game. 
</P>
<P>
	On the road, they were 0-4 against playoff teams this season.  
The 49ers haven't beaten a winning team on the road since a 25-15 
decision at Pittsburgh on Dec. 15, 1996, and haven't won away from 
home in the postseason since a 28-3 victory at Chicago in the NFC 
championship on Jan. 8, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to get over the emotional (Packers) win, which I  
think we have, and really turn the page and focus all our energies 
on Atlanta because this is a bigger game than last week, in a 
different environment, with more at stake,'' Mariucci said. 
</P>
<P>
	``So, we've got to be right. We've got to be better at handling  
that road environment, a hostile environment, and the only way I 
know how to do that is mature as a team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco safety Tim McDonald said the 49ers used tough,  
emotional play to come back against Green Bay and it's going to 
take a similar effort against the Falcons, who like the 49ers are 
unbeaten at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to play with the same kind of emotion,'' McDonald  
said. ``That's definitely a key for us. We have to make sure we 
take nothing for granted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco defensive tackle Brentson Buckner said the Falcons  
have developed a winning attitude at home and it showed the last 
time the teams met. Atlanta's victory snapped a five-game losing 
streak against San Francisco in front of the first sellout crowd at 
the Georgia Dome since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had that look in their eyes like, `We're in our own  
backyard. We're going to do what it takes to win,' and they just 
kept doing it,'' Buckner said. ``The more success they had, the 
more it built their confidence. They're on top of their game right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco will have to contend with another capacity crowd  
at the Georgia Dome on Saturday. To help get ready, the 49ers have 
installed huge speakers to blare music as they practice this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the crowd will be geeked up,'' Atlanta safety Eugene  
Robinson. ``For them, the 49ers have always been on top. Now that 
we have a chance to be on top, the fans are basking in the glory. 
The players are like, `We have the monkey off our back.' But we 
don't get credit for winning the game early. We get credit for 
winning this game. This is the most important game we have. It's 
going to be an all-out war.''

<HEADLINE> Kings' McKenna out 10-12 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Steve McKenna of the Los Angeles Kings  
is expected to miss 10 to 12 weeks while recovering from hernia 
sugery. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25-year-old left wing will begin rehabilitation in about  
three weeks, and the club anticipates a full recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The operation was performed Monday at Centinela Hospital Medical  
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	McKenna has missed 24 of the last 25 games because of an  
abdominal strain. He was originally injured Nov. 5 against St. 
Louis and missed 14 games. He returned Dec. 9 against Washington, 
aggravated the injury and has missed the last 10 games. He's on 
injured reserve for the second time this season.

<HEADLINE> IRS Evaluations Emphasize Attitudes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Instead of evaluating IRS employees by how  
much tax money they collect or punishment they dole out, new agency 
rules would gauge performance more on how they treat taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be a substantial change,'' said Robert Tobias,  
president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which includes 
Internal Revenue Service personnel. ``The IRS will focus on the

<HEADLINE> Price Gets Redemption With Key Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- In one priceless play, Peerless lived up to  
his name. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the fourth quarter Monday night, Peerless Price saw a  
sure touchdown -- and a national championship -- bounce off his chest 
into the hands of a defender. 
</P>
<P>
	Just four minutes later, Tennessee's big-play receiver gathered  
in the longest pass ever completed in the Fiesta Bowl, a 79-yarder 
that helped save the title. A perfect play to cinch a perfect 
season, capped by a 23-16 victory over Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels so good,'' Price said. ``I'm happy to make some plays  
for my team. It just feels good -- real good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was third-and-eight from the Tennessee 21 when Price went  
racing down the sidelines, outrunning cornerback Mario Edwards, and 
Tee Martin let fly. 
</P>
<P>
	At about the 25, Price caught the ball, held on tight and ran  
untouched into the end zone. The play, longest in Fiesta Bowl 
history, put Tennessee up 20-9 with 9:17 left. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just felt like my team needed a big play. We felt like we  
needed another score,'' Price said. ``The coaches gave me a great 
opportunity, just called a straight `go' route. I beat the DB and I 
made sure they weren't going to catch me this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vols held on to win, and there's no doubt what play the tens  
of thousands of orange-clad Tennessee fans in the record crowd of 
80,470 would remember most. 
</P>
<P>
	``Peerless Price has made more happen at wide receiver than any  
receiver we've had at Tennessee, and we've had some good ones,'' 
Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State's Peter Warrick was the wide receiver to watch  
going into the game. Price was the one to watch during the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was taking it real personal the more we talked about it,''  
Temmessee wide receiver Jermaine Copeland said. ``You know 
everybody's giving Peter Warrick more props (compliments) than they 
give Peerless Price. But to me, I'd pick him over Peter Warrick any 
day of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Price, the speedster from Dayton, Ohio, there could be no  
more dramatic way to make up for his mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the fourth quarter, Volunteers' punter David Leaverton  
had pinned the Seminoles on their own 1. Tennessee's defense held, 
as it did most of the long, penalty-filled night. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State punted and the Volunteers had first down on the  
Seminoles' 35. Leading 14-9, a touchdown would go a long way toward 
clinching the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	On first down, Martin went for it all. Price sliced between two  
defenders just across the goal line and the ball was delivered 
right on target. Inexplicably, the Vols' leading receiver, with 61 
catches going into the game, couldn't hang on. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball bounced off Price's chest into the hands of Dexter  
Jackson, who had a miserable first half when he was called for 
roughing the kicker on a field goal try and a late hit. Jackson 
returned the ball to the Florida State 26. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles moved to midfield, but once again, their offense  
stalled. Tennessee took over, and Price made the biggest play of 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
	The senior finished with four catches for 199 yards. In the only  
big Tennessee play of the first half, he caught a 76-yarder from 
Martin to set up the Vols' first touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Peerless I'd miss him next year,'' said Martin, a  
junior. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one player had more yards receiving in a Fiesta Bowl.  
Darnell McDonald of Kansas State had 206 yards receiving in the 
Wildcats' victory over Syracuse a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The longest pass play in the Fiesta Bowl had been McDonald's  
77-yard catch from Michael Bishop a year ago -- until Martin heaved 
the ball toward the desert stars and Price watched it fall right 
into his hands. 
</P>
<P>
	The 76-yarder and 79-yarder were the two longest pass plays  
against Florida State's vaunted defense all season. 
</P>
<P>
	Peerless, indeed.

<HEADLINE> WVU Pass Catcher Loses Bid To Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- David Saunders, West Virginia's career  
receptions leader, was denied his bid for an extra year of college 
eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA Monday rejected the school's petition for a rare sixth  
of eligibility for Saunders. 
</P>
<P>
	Saunders, a senior who led the Big East in receptions and yards  
in 1996 and 1998, missed the entire 1997 season after tearing knee 
ligaments at the start of practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NCAA staff based its decision on precedent,'' said Brad  
Cox, WVU's compliance director. ``In the past, they approved an 
extra year only for someone who was injured two seasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He caught a school record-tying 77 passes for 883 yards and  
eight touchdowns this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Saunders now is looking ahead to the NFL draft this spring.  
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely want to play at the next level,'' Saunders said.  
``I don't think anyone who ever has the opportunity wouldn't want 
to play in the NFL.''

<HEADLINE> For Alex Kingston, Life Is Smooth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Alex Kingston's romance on ``ER'' may be  
rocky but everything is smooth in real life. The British actress 
has married a writer she met on a blind date. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kingston, 35, and Florian Haertel, 34, were wed Dec. 29 in  
Santa Fe, N.M., her publicist, Nancy Seltzer, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second marriage for Ms. Kingston, who was divorced  
from actor Ralph Fiennes (``The English Patient'') in 1997. It is 
the first for Haertel, a native of Munich, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	He is a freelance writer for German media, Seltzer said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kingston began as a theater actress before adding film and  
TV roles. As Dr. Elizabeth Corday on NBC's medical drama ``ER,'' 
she has an on-again, off-again relationship with fellow surgeon 
Peter Benton (Eriq La Salle).

<HEADLINE> U.S. Construction Rises in Nov. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. construction spending increased for the  
sixth consecutive month in November, propelled by strong gains in 
housing and government projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending advanced 0.9 percent from the month before to a  
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $677.8 billion, the Commerce 
Department said today. It was the first time the volatile series 
posted six consecutive gains since 1993. And it was the largest 
increase since July. 
</P>
<P>
	Low interest rates have fueled robust construction, both of new  
homes and commercial projects, and overall construction spending in 
November was 8.8 percent higher than a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	However, in November, commercial spending edged down 0.1 percent  
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $174.6 billion, the first 
decline in four months. Sizable gains in spending on offices and 
retail stores did not quite offset big drops for hotels and motels 
and factories. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending on housing jumped 1.2 percent, propelled by a 1.8  
percent advance in single-family homes. However, apartment 
construction edged down 0.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Increases for schools and streets and highways helped push  
government spending up by 2.1 percent in November, almost making up 
for a 2.7 percent decline in October.

<HEADLINE> Yount Excited Over Hall Induction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Robin Yount and George Brett always had a lot  
in common. 
</P>
<P>
	They were California kids who spent their entire careers in  
small market clubs in the Midwest, Yount in Milwaukee and Brett in 
Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Each arrived in the big leagues to stay in 1974 and they left  
together after the 1993 season, becoming fast friends along the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, they've got the finest similarity of all: both will be  
inducted into baseball's Hall of fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. next 
summer, along with strikeout king Nolan Ryan. The three rookie 
candidates were elected Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of all the guys I played against,'' Brett said, ``probably  
Robin is the guy I enjoyed playing against the most.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Yount: ``If there was one player I ever wanted to be like,  
it was George Brett.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yount, who played his entire 20-year career in Milwaukee, where  
he collected 3,142 hits -- 12 fewer than Brett -- and brought the 
city its only AL crown in 1982, said entering the Hall with his pal 
is special. 
</P>
<P>
	``It couldn't be any better,'' Yount said from his office in  
Phoenix. ``There's no other player that I played against that I 
would want to go in with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yount figured the two would even do their celebrating together.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have a feeling George and I will probably go out on the town  
in New York tonight,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yount said he owes a lot to Brett because he became a Hall of  
Famer by emulating his friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I'm concerned, George Brett was the prototype  
baseball player,'' Yount said. ``I mean, everything he did, the way 
he played the game, the clutch performances he came up with time 
and time again and the consistency he showed year after year. His 
attitude impressed me and was something I always wished I was able 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was able to play the game like he was playing a Little  
League game all the time, but with the intensity to win every game 
but yet be able to laugh while it was going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brett had a higher career batting average and more doubles,  
triples, homers and RBIs than Yount, who played more games, scored 
more runs and stole more bases. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Brett played with a smile, Yount played with a furled  
brow. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pretty serious when I got between the lines,'' Yount  
said. ``I was always more of a tunnel vision type of player. ... At 
least I tried as hard as George. I gave it every thing I got every 
time I went out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So, how did Yount and Brett become such good friends?  
</P>
<P>
	``I think we kind of grew up together in similar lives,'' Yount  
said. ``We had a lot in common. We were both from the L.A. area and 
played similar positions. If you look at the stats he had better 
numbers because he was a better player than I was. We had mutual 
respect for each other on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing because I never really associated much with  
players on the other team. But we just hit it off and became close 
friends even though we were competitors on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yount's fierce hustle catapulted him to the major leagues as a  
baby-faced 18-year-old shortstop in 1974 and led the Brewers' 
charge to the World Series in 1982, where they lost to the St. 
Louis Cardinals in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took a little while to think I belonged in the majors  
because I was thrown in to on-the-job training,'' Yount said. ``It 
took a few years for me to realize I belonged on the field with 
these guys. But I never doubted that I could do it once I was 
there. I wasn't real satisfied with what I did the first few years 
but I knew I would get there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Did he ever.  
</P>
<P>
	Yount would become the first shortstop to lead the league in  
slugging and total bases, one of three players to win MVP awards at 
two positions, the only player with 1,000 games at shortstop and 
1,000 in the outfield and the third-youngest player (at 36 years, 
11 months, 24 days) to collect his 3,000th hit. 
</P>
<P>
	But his highlight was the 1982 season when he won the MVP by  
hitting .331 with 29 homers and 114 RBIs and came within three 
innings of a champagne shower. 
</P>
<P>
	Yount had three All-Star appearances, two Most Valuable Player  
awards and only one regret -- that he never brought the Brewers a 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other than having the championship ring and a trophy, I really  
don't think I've missed anything,'' Yount said when he retired in 
January 1994, saying his four children needed a father more than he 
needed baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	When a shoulder injury relegated him to the outfield in 1985,  
Yount responded by winning his second MVP in 1989, this time as a 
centerfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Late in their careers, a little of Brett's smile even rubbed off  
on Yount. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had two bad knees at the time and I couldn't throw a  
lick,'' Yount recalled. ``When he was on second base I'd start 
winding my arm up and he'd start stretching his legs like there was 
going to be a play at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most likely he probably wasn't going to be able to get to home  
and I certainly couldn't throw it that far. I can remember that a 
lot. Every time he was on second and I was in center we'd tease 
each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Brett retired in September 1993, he said: ``The thing I'm  
going to miss most is the hard, hustling play of guys like Robin 
Yount. And when he retires, baseball is going to miss that style of 
play, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four months later, Yount joined his friend in retirement.  
</P>
<P>
	Next summer, he joins him in Cooperstown.

<HEADLINE> Soccer, Olympics Leaders To Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Seemingly farther apart than ever on drug  
sanctions and facing a possible clash between their top events, the 
leaders of world soccer and the Olympics hold a crucial meeting 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The summit between FIFA president Sepp Blatter and IOC president  
Juan Antonio Samaranch is expected to focus on FIFA's opposition to 
the IOC's recommended minimum two-year suspension for athletes 
found using steroids. 
</P>
<P>
	But Blatter's dramatic proposal to hold the World Cup every two  
years, floated just three days before the session, has raised the 
possibility of a head-on collision between soccer's premier 
competition and the summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	A biennial World Cup would have the tournament staged in Olympic  
years, which could lead to scheduling conflicts and a fight for 
sponsorship and television rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Blatter said the change would likely be introduced in  
2008, FIFA says a special, smaller World Cup-type event likely will 
be held in 2004 to mark its 100th birthday. The Summer Olympics are 
set for Athens Aug. 13-29, 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	``The international federations are absolutely free to set their  
own programs,'' IOC director general Francois Carrard said Tuesday. 
``They can have their world championships every week, every year. 
That's their own problem. We don't intervene in that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reasonable people would find a way so that major competitions  
such as Olympic Games and the World Cup would not enter into 
conflict over dates. We will wait to hear from Sepp Blatter. I'm 
sure he will not start (a conflict).'' 
</P>
<P>
	FIFA denies the summit meeting at its Zurich headquarters, where  
Samaranch will be accompanied by a high-level IOC delegation, will 
see a clash of incompatible views. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can only be good that major organizations are talking to  
each other,'' federation spokesman Andreas Herren said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blatter said soccer is ``not at all'' finished as an Olympic  
sport if the World Cup goes to a two-year cycle. But he stressed 
the Olympic competition would remain restricted mostly to players 
23 and under. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC and FIFA, probably the two most powerful bodies in  
international sport, have been at odds over the drug problem for 
some time. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC wants all Olympic sports federations to apply common  
rules and penalties, including a minimum two-year suspension for 
athletes using steroids and other major performance-enhancing 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	If federations refuse to apply the rule, they risk being dropped  
from the Olympic program. 
</P>
<P>
	Soccer, cycling and tennis have expressed reservations to the  
Olympic resolution, adopted in November. The other 32 Olympic 
federations have approved it. 
</P>
<P>
	FIFA officials questioned whether the penalty was enforceable  
and argued that not all drugs on the IOC's banned list have 
performance-enhancing qualities for soccer players. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has said he is confident that FIFA will sign up to the  
agreement before the IOC's Feb. 2-4 world anti-doping summit in 
Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	But FIFA's medical chief appeared to dash those hopes Monday,  
saying that ``FIFA will never change its opinion on this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if FIFA stands alone, it is old and big enough to take  
care of itself,'' medical committee chairman Michel D'Hooghe said. 
</P>
<P>
	The structure of the Olympic soccer tournament is another  
contentious issue. FIFA has always made sure that its World Cup, 
which started in 1930, would not be overshadowed by an Olympic 
soccer tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a request from Samaranch, the soccer body said in  
November it wouldn't expand a slight concession made in 1996 
allowing teams to field three players over 23. Samaranch hoped FIFA 
would allow teams to field five players over 23 at the 2000 Sydney 
Games.

<HEADLINE> Jets Watch Playoffs To Learn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- The New York Jets were not typical  
television viewers during last weekend's NFL playoff games. They 
were watching to learn. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the obvious benefits from having a bye in the first  
week of the playoffs -- added rest and preparation time, a respite 
from the attention and the pressure -- the Jets were afforded the 
opportunity to sit in front of their TVs. They took advantage of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	So when coach Bill Parcells mentioned some specific plays that  
hurt losing teams on wild-card weekend, his players knew exactly 
what he was referring to. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was letting us know that this time of year, these are the  
things that can get you beat,'' receiver Wayne Chrebet said. 
``Penalties, personal fouls ... what happened with Andre Reed ... 
Big things and little things he wants us to think about. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mental part of the game is huge during the season and it's  
even more huge now. He says he wants to coach a smart team, and 
something you do -- it could be in the first quarter or the last 
minutes -- can determine the outcome of a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells openly discussed with his players some of the plays  
that determined the outcomes at Miami, Jacksonville, Dallas and San 
Francisco on Saturday and Sunday. He specifically mentioned Reed's 
personal foul penalty and expulsion after being denied a touchdown 
in the final moments of Buffalo's game at Miami, and the coverage 
by Green Bay's safeties on the 49ers' game-winning pass to Terrell 
Owens with three seconds to go at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``The obvious is what I am interested in, the things that  
obviously cause your team to go home,'' Parcells said. ``I will 
mention it: I don't know what the Green Bay safeties were doing in 
the end zone. That's a very serious mistake in judgment that 
probably cost them the game. All you've got to do is keep the guy 
in front of you. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not stepping up, as people say. The games are just  
higher-intensity games, everything is a little higher, so you've 
got to go with the flow. There were a couple teams this weekend 
that didn't know a playoff was going on; one team was playing at 
one level, the other team at another level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In general, the Jets have played smartly this year, particularly  
in the second half of the season, when they went 7-1. They've 
avoided turnovers -- Parcells' pet peeve -- unsettling penalties and 
mental mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	When the coaching staff is harping on every little error during  
practice, the message sinks in. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more of a mental focus at this time,'' said tackle Jumbo  
Elliott, who played for the 1990 Super Bowl champion New York 
Giants that Parcells coached. ``The NFL is intense all the time and 
very physical, but the mental focus is a little more critical now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Physically, you can give only 100 percent; there is no such  
thing as 110 percent. Mentally, the focus is on the task at hand, 
with the ultimate goal only in the back of your mind. That's 
something you have to do, focus on what is coming up now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What's coming up now is Sunday's game with Jacksonville, which  
beat New England in the first round. The Jets believe they will be 
sharp physically, thanks to the bye. But will they have that mental 
edge? 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything else in mind but beating Jacksonville,'' Bryan Cox  
said, ``is wasted energy.''

<HEADLINE> Group Denies Helping Kosovo Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A prominent international  
humanitarian group denied allegations that it is supplying arms to 
ethnic Albanian rebels battling for independence in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Bas Tielens, a spokesman for the group, Doctors Without Borders,  
said Monday that Serb accusations that the group is helping Kosovo 
Albanian guerrillas are unfounded and came ``out of the blue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, Vukasin Andric, health secretary for Kosovo, had  
said that members of the Paris-based group were ``caught hiding and 
smuggling weapons for Albanian terrorists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement carried by the independent Beta news agency,  
Andric did not provide details to back up his accusation. 
</P>
<P>
	Tielens said the origin of the charges was unclear, and noted  
that his organization has been working in the Serbian province 
since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors Without Borders provides emergency relief using more  
than 2,000 medical professionals working in more than 80 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Its continued work in Kosovo could be in jeopardy, however,  
based on Andric's comments. 
</P>
<P>
	His charge underscores the view of many Serbs that international  
diplomats and aid workers are biased in favor of the ethnic 
Albanians in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are often victims of such accusations, particularly in a  
context of war,'' a spokesman for the organization, Benedicte 
Jeannerod, said in Paris. ``We are regularly accused of spying. The 
truth is that we are trying to help the population on both sides of 
the conflict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,000 people have been killed and some 300,000  
uprooted from their homes since Serbian authorities launched a 
crackdown last February against Kosovo Albanian rebels fighting for 
independence from Serbia, the larger of two republics left in 
Yugoslavia. Most of the victims have been ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S.-brokered truce in October ended most of the fighting. But  
the two sides are far from a negotiated settlement on Kosovo's 
future status, and a State Department spokesman warned Monday that 
time for talks is fast running out. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think both sides need to understand that there is not that  
much time left for a negotiated solution which can give the 
legitimate rights to the people of Kosovo and protect the national 
interests of the Serbs before we face the prospect of renewed and 
very dangerous conflict this spring,'' James Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the rebels' apparent unwillingness to compromise, a  
guerrilla spokesman told the Albanian prime minister on Monday his 
group would agree to a meeting of rival Kosovo leaders in order to 
work out a joint strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Albanian government said Adem Demaci made the statement  
during a meeting in the Albanian capital Tirana on Monday night 
with Prime Minister Pandeli Majko. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been sporadic fighting in Kosovo since the October  
truce, most notably during intense clashes from Dec. 24-27.

<HEADLINE> Elton John Plans Solo Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Elton John is going solo for the first time.  
</P>
<P>
	Beginning next month, the singer will be touring small U.S.  
cities with just his piano. It's his first time on the road without 
a band. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a way to keep myself fresh and on my toes,'' John, 51,  
said in Tuesday's editions of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing alone is rewarding because ``you get to do numbers you  
don't normally perform with a band, and it gives you a chance to 
talk to the audience,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tour begins Feb. 19 in Roanoke, Virginia. He will also play  
in Tennessee, Florida, Mississippi, Michigan, Louisiana, Iowa, 
Alabama and Illinois.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Gov't To Petition Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- The Philippine government will ask  
the Supreme Court to reconsider a decision suspending the death 
penalty law and the execution of a convicted rapist, officials said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The court issued the decision on Monday, just three hours before  
Leo Echegaray, a poor house painter convicted of repeatedly raping 
his 10-year-old stepdaughter, was to have been put to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Echegaray's scheduled execution set off a debate over the death  
penalty that divided many Filipinos. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Secretary Serafin Cuevas said the government will  
petition the court within the week to reconsider the decision and 
order Echegaray's execution to proceed. The government has 15 days 
to file the petition after receiving the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	After the court announced the decision, about 100 anti-death  
penalty activists, nuns and priests cheered and a church bell 
pealed outside the prison in Muntinlupa, a Manila suburb, where 
Echegaray was waiting to be executed. 
</P>
<P>
	Echegaray wept with joy after learning of the court decision  
shortly before he was to eat what would have been his last meal. 
</P>
<P>
	President Joseph Estrada, however, expressed deep dismay,  
calling it a ``sad day for law enforcement and the rule of law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several lawmakers had recently expressed doubts whether capital  
punishment would deter crime and sought a congressional review of 
the law that restored capital punishment in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	In its 8-5 ruling, the Supreme Court said ``the merest chance  
that the Congress might reconsider'' the law required that 
Echegaray, 38, be granted a postponement. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is definitely a victory, a significant first step in  
abolishing the death penalty in this country,'' said Echegaray's 
lawyer, Theodore Te. 
</P>
<P>
	But Estrada, who has pledged to solve the country's serious  
crime problems, said the court overstepped its role of enforcing 
existing laws, and promised to veto any new law repealing the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Echegaray, who was convicted in 1994, is the first among more  
than 800 death-row inmates to be scheduled for execution. More than 
450 of those on death row were convicted of rape, including 159 who 
abused their own children or other close relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the death penalty condemned the court's ruling,  
saying it would embolden would-be criminals and portray the 
government as indecisive and unable to enforce the country's laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1924 and 1976, the Philippines executed 84 people. In  
1987, a new constitution abolished the death penalty but gave 
Congress the option of restoring it for ``heinous'' crimes such as 
murder, kidnapping, rape and drug trafficking. Legislators, alarmed 
by a rise in crime, brought back capital punishment in January 
1994.

<HEADLINE>  New Speaker Promises To Get To Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Dennis Hastert says his main goal when he  
is chosen speaker of the House is to end the political divisions 
that have held legislation hostage, and thereby restore the 
nation's faith in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Congress has to go to work, we have to start to produce  
good things that the American people want, policy that addresses 
the needs of the American people,'' the Illinois Republican said 
before a meeting with GOP leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's our first and most important step in restoring faith in  
this U.S. House of Representatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans will meet late today to choose Hastert, a  
little-known six-term lawmaker, to succeed Newt Gingrich as their 
leader. On Wednesday he is to be formally elected speaker with the 
convening of the 106th session of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert's surprise rise to the leadership spot followed  
Gingrich's decision to resign in the wake of Republican losses in 
the November elections and the announcement last month by 
Gingrich's expected successor, Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., that he 
had had extramarital affairs and would not seek the speakership. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert takes over a House deeply divided by the impeachment of  
President Clinton and paralyzed by partisan clashes. He pledged to 
reach out to Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things that I want to do is to open the  
possibilities for this House to work together. We need to work 
together, especially on very substantive issues, on a bipartisan 
basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that his top legislative goals include reforming Social  
Security and Medicare, improving the nation's education system, 
providing tax relief and boosting national defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will be me and I'm not going to try to emulate Newt or  
anybody else,'' Hastert, the 57-year-old former high school teacher 
said when asked how he would differ from the outspoken Gingrich. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to start our agenda now,'' he said. ``We intend not to  
talk about those issues but deliver.''

<HEADLINE>  Holzer Upsets Austrians in Slalom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KRANJSKA GORA, Slovenia (AP) -- Patrick Holzer of Italy scored  
his first World Cup victory in seven years today, beating the 
dominant Austrian skiers in the giant slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	Holzer was sixth after the first run, then skied a flawless  
second run to win the race in 2 minutes, 14.91 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Austrian Christian Mayer, who was leading after the first run,  
finished second in 2:15.15. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Austrian, Hans Knauss, skied two solid runs down the  
steep and icy hill to finish third, 31 hundredths of a second 
behind Holzer. 
</P>
<P>
	A third Austrian, Benjamin Raich, finished fourth.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Yogi: Feud With Steinbrenner Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``It's over,'' Yogi says.  
</P>
<P>
	And when Yogi Berra says it's over, it's over.  
</P>
<P>
	With those two words and a simple handshake, the Yankees Hall of  
Fame catcher put an end Tuesday to his 14-year feud with George 
Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	The rift began when the Boss fired Berra as New York's manager  
only 16 games into the 1985 season. The man who made popular the 
phrase ``it ain't over 'til it's over'' had stayed away from Yankee 
Stadium ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fourteen years, I'd say, is long enough,'' the 73-year-old  
Berra said. ``He apologized again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an appropriate setting, the Yogi Berra Museum on the campus  
of Montclair (N.J.) State University, Steinbrenner came to 
reconcile. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't realize how much I'd screwed up. It was a major  
screw-up. It was a stupid thing on my part,'' the Yankees owner 
said. ``It was a monumental mistake on my part. Sometimes, it takes 
a long time to get things right. Yogi is a highly principled man. I 
messed up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just happy he feels it's time to put this behind us,'' he  
said, standing next to Berra for an interview on WFAN. ``I'm glad 
he's said, `George, I forgive you.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Berra has not been at Yankee Stadium for an official function  
since he was replaced by Billy Martin with a 6-10 record in 1985, 
though he has occasionally showed up to visit friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Berra, who managed the Yankees to the World Series in 1964, had  
returned for the 1984 season and went 87-75. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no word yet, but look for Berra to be back at the  
ballpark this year, throwing out a first ball and appearing at 
Old-Timers Day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him how much I wanted him to come back to Yankee  
Stadium again, where he belongs,'' Steinbrenner said. ``I didn't 
feel right winning the World Series last year and not having Yogi 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to have him sitting with me sometimes, just to talk  
about what's going on,'' he said. ``He is a treasure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Berra wanted to make this clear: He never stopped rooting  
for his old team, for which he won three AL MVP awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pulled for them,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, before a Yankees-Mets interleague game at Shea  
Stadium, Berra seemed to indicate a possible thaw in his 
Steinbrenner freeze. The official end came Tuesday when 
Steinbrenner flew in from Florida and met for 15 minutes with Berra 
and his wife, Carmen, at the museum. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, Berra gave Steinbrenner a 45-minute tour of the  
building on the campus of his adopted alma mater. Steinbrenner said 
he was impressed with the items on display, including uniforms, 
bats and the mitt he used to catch Don Larsen's perfect game in the 
1956 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could spend a whole day here,'' Steinbrenner said. ``I'm  
going to start sending him some stuff.''

<HEADLINE> Saywer, Gibson Named 'GMA' Hosts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Diane Sawyer and Charles Gibson had reason to  
wonder whether ABC News President David Westin was serious when he 
asked them to take over as co-hosts of ``Good Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sawyer is one of the news division's prime-time stars who has  
long since paid her dues on morning television. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson had left the show just last April after 11 years as  
co-host, believing he had put the struggling show behind him. He 
and Ms. Sawyer ``both sort of giggled'' at the idea of becoming 
morning show hosts again. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden we realized that they weren't kidding,''  
Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not at all. ABC said Monday that Ms. Sawyer and Gibson would  
take over in two weeks, its most dramatic effort to turn around a 
show that has sunk slowly in the ratings through the 1990s. They 
replace Kevin Newman and Lisa McRee. 
</P>
<P>
	Westin said ABC needed to send a strong signal that it was  
serious about improving ``Good Morning America.'' He appealed to 
Gibson and Ms. Sawyer as team players, convincing them that the 
entire news division's image suffered because the show had become 
something of an industry joke. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear how long the Gibson-Sawyer team will stay on. Ms.  
Sawyer said it would likely be a few months, but Gibson said that 
``we'll do it for as long as it takes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sawyer, who was Charles Kuralt's co-host on the ``CBS  
Morning News'' from 1981-84, will continue as a correspondent on 
the newsmagazine ``20/20.'' But she will cut down on her traveling. 
</P>
<P>
	The surprise announcement comes as the once-dominant morning  
show has slipped perilously close to third place in the ratings. 
McRee and Newman, who both joined within the past two years, 
haven't helped. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this season, NBC's ``Today'' show has a 5.3 rating and 21  
audience share in the morning competition. ``Good Morning America'' 
has a 3.3 rating and ``This Morning'' on CBS is at 3.0. Ratings for 
NBC and CBS are unchanged from last year, while ABC has dropped 17 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Westin conceded that network management had tried to change the  
show without a clear vision of where it wanted to go. 
</P>
<P>
	Now ABC wants to hearken back to the feel-good 1980s, when  
co-hosts Joan Lunden and David Hartman, and later Gibson, had ABC 
at the top of the ratings. Westin said he wanted the show to 
radiate ``warmth with intelligence and a sense of family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC is gambling that Gibson and Sawyer can bring a short-term  
ratings bump that can be built upon when the show moves to a new 
studio in New York's Times Square, perhaps as early as September. 
The risk is that tradition-bound morning viewers, already reeling 
from rapid changes on ``Good Morning America,'' will see this as a 
short-term fix. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC also shuffled the top management of ``Good Morning  
America.'' Shelley Ross, a senior producer with ``20/20,'' is 
replacing Shelley Lewis as executive producer. Phyllis McGrady, 
former executive producer of ``PrimeTime Live,'' was named the ABC 
News executive-in-charge of the show. 
</P>
<P>
	Newman will become a reporter at ``Nightline'' and McRee will be  
a Los Angeles-based correspondent for ABC News.

<HEADLINE> Trump Pledges To Use Minority Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Donald Trump says his promise to  
hire minority construction firms to help build the Trump 
International Golf Club is a good one. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump reaffirmed his commitment in a letter to the Palm Beach  
County Commission after chairwoman Maude Ford Lee wrote him last 
month, saying she was disappointed in the lack of minority 
participation in the $40 million project so far. The club is to 
open in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Trump is building the 18-hole course and clubhouse on  
215 county-owned acres, 30 percent of the project must be handled 
by minority firms. 
</P>
<P>
	In the three-page letter, Trump said minority-owned businesses  
have never been excluded from the project. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have a long way to go in completing the project and  
we fully intend to honor these very important commitments,'' Trump 
wrote.

<HEADLINE> Green Bay Coach Ponders Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Green Bay coach Mike Holmgren said today  
he would be interviewing with NFL teams in Seattle, Baltimore and 
Philadelphia, but might return to the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren said the Seahawks, Ravens and Eagles contacted the  
Packers on Monday for permission to talk to him. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Packers having made their earliest playoff exit under  
Holmgren when they were beaten Sunday by San Francisco, the Green 
Bay coach reiterated he was interested in a job as both coach and 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great job here,'' he said. ``So why am I even  
considering any of this other stuff? Because of the challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the teams that Holmgren said had sought to contact him,  
Cleveland also reportedly is interested. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Seattle will be very strong,'' a source within the  
Packers organization, who asked not to be identified, told the 
Wisconsin State Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Journal-Constitution quoted league insiders as  
saying Monday that a contract with Seattle could be worked out 
within 48 hours if the sides can agree on how much power Holmgren 
would have. It said the Seahawks are offering a five-year deal 
worth $4.2 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
	But Holmgren said no deal had been made with Seattle.  
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay general manager Ron Wolf, who said his New Year's  
resolution was to stay quiet on the matter until Holmgren made up 
his mind, said Monday that the Packers had given Holmgren 
permission to talk with the Ravens, Eagles and Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll give this to you today, but in the future I don't think  
this is my job,'' Wolf said. ``It's Mike Holmgren's thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren's agent, Bob LaMonte, didn't return phone calls seeking  
comment on whether Holmgren would meet with any of the three 
suitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren could still return to Green Bay and sign an extension  
that would make him the highest-paid coach in the NFL at about $4 
million per season, but he'd still lack the final say on personnel 
matters that he desperately covets. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren delayed his season-ending news conference until today,  
but he might have tipped his hand about his intentions after San 
Francisco's 30-27 victory, when he said of the Packers: ``They'll 
be good for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On his weekly television show Monday night, Holmgren said he  
expected to know very soon where he'll be coaching next season: ``I 
would suspect things would happen rather quickly now because 
there's a lot of places that are open and we'll see. If it doesn't 
happen quickly, then it won't happen.''

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com's Sales Soar in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Internet bookseller Amazon.com reported sharply  
higher sales for its fiscal fourth quarter Tuesday, but its stock 
seesawed as investors disagreed over whether the figures were in 
line with their expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle-based company reported that its quarterly sales more  
than tripled from a year ago to about $250 million, well above most 
forecasts. But some analysts were still disappointed since they had 
quietly hoped for an even bigger rise in sales during the quarter, 
to about $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a whisper number out there that some people focused  
on and were upset when they didn't see it,'' said Derek Brown, 
senior analyst at Volpe Brown &AMP; Whelan Co. ``That number was 
totally unrealistic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com said the big sales gains would not reduce its  
expected losses for the fourth quarter. Chief financial officer Joy 
Covey said profits were hurt by higher customer service costs and 
aggressive pricing. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street analysts estimate a loss of 56 cents a share for the  
period. The company will release its full financial report for the 
fourth quarter in late January. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com's stock fell almost 10 percent in early trading  
before rebounding. In afternoon trading, its shares were up $8.12 1/2, 
or 6.9 percent, at $126.37 1/2, reflecting a 3-for-1 stock split that 
took effect Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But even among those dissatisfied with Amazon.com's figures,  
most said that the company continues to be the premier Internet 
retailer, which many upstarts hope to mimic. 
</P>
<P>
	While the company has yet to be profitable, sales are expected  
to be about $600 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	During the holiday season, Amazon.com shipped more than 7.5  
million items, topping the total for all of 1997. Fueling some of 
its gains was its expansion into other areas beyond books. It now 
sells videos, music and a selection of toys and electronics.

<HEADLINE> Gators' Kearse, McGrew Enter Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida linebacker Jevon Kearse and  
defensive tackle Reggie McGrew said Tuesday they will forgo their 
senior seasons and enter the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Kearse, a 6-foot-5, 250-pounder, had 54 tackles and a team-best  
7 1/2 sacks for the nation's ninth-ranked defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've accomplished the four goals I wanted to when I  
attended the University of Florida: To become a better person, to 
win a national championship, to get an education and finally to 
have a chance to play in the NFL,'' said Kearse, a projected top-10 
pick who could play defensive end. ``That time is now. I'm not 
going to pass it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGrew, a 6-foot-2, 295-pound All-Southeastern Conference  
selection, had 41 tackles and five sacks in nine games this season. 
He missed two games with a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say it was an easy decision, but once I looked at  
it and weighed all my options, it wasn't that hard of a decision to 
make,'' said McGrew, who had seven tackles and two sacks in the 
Gators' 23-12 loss to Florida State on Nov. 21. ``I've accomplished 
a lot. I was all-conference this year, I won a couple of SECs and a 
national championship. I'm close to getting my degree and I've made 
a lot of good friends here.''

	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori shuffled much of  
his Cabinet on Tuesday, naming a new group of minister that he said 
would pull Peru out of a deep economic recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Fujimori's new Cabinet that leaves only four of 15 ministers in  
their previous posts. 
</P>
<P>
	Fujimori's longtime ally Victor Joy Way, currently head of  
Congress, will occupy the key posts of prime minister and finance 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Fujimori said he would keep his government's free-market  
economic program in place despite replacing Finance Minister Jorge 
Baca. The shuffle, he said, formed a team able to jump-start the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine ministers, including agriculture, justice, health and  
industry, will be replaced and two others rotated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After growing by more than 7.4 percent in 1997, Peru's economy  
ground to a near halt, growing only 1.5 percent in 1998 due to the 
Asian crisis and damage caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon.

	MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- Adrift in the Pacific for a month,  
seven fishermen drank the blood of turtles to stay alive and 
watched two boats pass them by without stopping, according to news 
reports Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	They were rescued Monday by a Norwegian merchant ship, weeks  
after rescuers ended a search and had given up the crew for dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The crew will be at sea for about 10 more days until the boat  
docks in Hawaii and they can fly home to Nicaragua, officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Norwegians found the boat with its crew adrift 500 miles  
from its starting point, the port of San Juan de Sur on Nicaragua's 
southern Pacific coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship's captain, Manuel Salvador Talavera, said his ship's  
engine failed on the first day of a fishing expedition Dec. 5, and 
their supply of drinking water ran out 10 days later.

	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto

</P>
<P>
	Robaina was to meet President Rene Preval and Haiti's foreign  
and health ministers during his stay in Port-au-Prince. 
</P>
<P>
	Haiti restored diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1996 after a  
34-year break in what was seen as a slap at the United States, 
which had sent 20,000 troops to the island to end a military 
dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, Preval and Cuban President Fidel Castro signed a  
cooperative agreement under which about 130 Cuban doctors, nurses 
and medical technicians have come to work in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
	By March, about 300 Cuban medical workers will be stationed in  
Haiti, Health Minister Jean Moliere told Radio Haiti-Inter.

	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The new year brought a new name into the mix of  
head coaching candidates for the new Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Art Shell, the first black NFL head coach in the modern era and  
current offensive line coach for the Atlanta Falcons, will meet 
with Cleveland president Carmen Policy as soon as next next Sunday, 
the Browns said on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons gave Policy permission to interview Shell last week,  
and the Browns had hoped to bring him in for a formal interview on 
Monday. However, inclement weather contributed to preventing 
details for a visit from being completed during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've told Art that we want to talk to him and hopefully we'll  
be able to do that soon. Art will be in Sunday at the earliest,'' 
Browns spokesman Alex Martins said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFC West champion Falcons were idle last weekend. They will  
play host to the San Francisco 49ers in a playoff game Saturday at 
the Georgia Dome. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an agreement with the NFL, Cleveland, which will return to  
the league next year as an expansion team after a three-year 
hiatus, has been granted exclusive permission by the NFL to 
interview assistant coaches on teams that are in this year's 
playoffs. The Browns, though, are prohibited from offering any of 
those coaches a job until their team has been eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	Shell, 52, will be the third coaching candidate interviewed by  
the Browns. Last week, Minnesota offensive coordinator Brian 
Billick and Denver offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak had extensive 
interviews with Policy at the Browns' headquarters in Berea, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Martins said that no other interviews had been scheduled by the  
Browns for this week. Policy also plans to bring in Jacksonville 
offensive coordinator Chris Palmer for an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Shell, a Hall of Fame offensive tackle with Oakland, became the  
Raiders head coach four games into the 1989 season when Mike 
Shanahan was fired. Shell spent five years with Raiders, leading 
them to three playoff appearances and a 56-41 record before being 
fired after the '94 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Shell, however, has rarely been mentioned as a candidate for any  
head coaching job recently despite there still being six vacancies 
around the league. 
</P>
<P>
	After five coaches were fired last Monday, Tampa Bay coach Tony  
Dungy, who is also black, questioned why it is that black coaches 
continue to be overlooked for head coaching positions. The last 17 
head coaches hired since Dungy went to the Buccaneers after the 
1995 season all are white. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's baffling,'' Dungy said. ``There still seems to be a  
perception out there clouding owners' minds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shell was in coaches meetings all day Monday and couldn't be  
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Policy said last week he planned to speak with Ray Rhodes, a  
black coach fired by Philadelphia recently, about Rhodes' football 
future but that the discussion would be personal rather than 
professional. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Browns are awaiting news on two other fronts.  
</P>
<P>
	Following his team's playoff loss in San Francisco on Sunday,  
Green Bay coach Mike Holmgren wouldn't comment on his future with 
the Packers. There is speculation that Holmgren could return to San 
Francisco, freeing 49ers coach Steve Mariucci to rejoin Policy with 
the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns were also eager to see which college underclassmen  
would declare themselves eligible for April's NFL Draft by Friday's 
deadline. Cleveland owns the first overall pick and is likely to 
select either Texas running back Ricky Williams or Kentucky 
quarterback Tim Couch, a junior who has a year of eligibility 
remaining.

	Low on groceries, Rena Crocker pushed through bone-chilling wind  
and blowing snow to reach a friend's home in Buffalo, N.Y. With her 
was her 7-year-old son, Julian, so wrapped up that only his eyes 
and snow-covered lashes were visible. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is outrageous. This is just crazy!'' said Crocker as she  
trudged along. ``I'm used to Buffalo winters, but this ... .'' 
</P>
<P>
	The storm left waist-high snowdrifts in western New York,  
dumping up to 15 inches as it closed highways, businesses and 
airports Monday. An additional 6 inches fell overnight and schools 
in the snow-savvy city were closed again today. Part of Interstate 
90 was closed Monday and the last 60-mile stretch didn't reopen 
until this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the latest blow in the arctic blast that began over the  
weekend with up to 2 feet of snow in places in the Midwest, and 
plunged the eastern two-thirds of the nation to record low 
temperatures today. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning dawned as the coldest on record in Illinois with a  
reading of 36 degrees below zero at the town of Congerville, about 
120 miles southwest of Chicago in the central part of thestate. The 
state's previous all-time record of 35 below was set on Jan. 22, 
1930, in Mount Carroll in northwestern Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Thermometers at Lincoln and Champaign, Ill., registered lows  
today of 25 below zero, and Crawfordsville, Ind., fell to 26 below. 
Wind chills on the northern Plains measured 60 below zero. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures were in the teens across much of the South early  
today, with Meridian, Miss., hitting a record low for the date of 
11 and even New Orleans chilling to a record 20. Jackson, Tenn., 
had a low of just 6 above zero. 
</P>
<P>
	And with temperatures in the teens in upstate South Carolina,  
which got an ice storm during the weekend, some 54,000 customers 
still had no electricity today. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 89 deaths had been blamed on the weather from the  
Plains across the Midwest into Ontario, many of them from traffic 
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Airports around the nation were still having trouble  
accommodating passengers, even in areas where the storm is long 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
	Early today, stranded passengers at Detroit Metropolitan Airport  
received more bad news as Northwest Airlines canceled about 100 
flights because it had trouble getting crews in. A foot of snow was 
on the ground in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	A Northwest spokesman in Minneapolis said the airline had  
canceled more than 1,100 flights since Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Many customers were angered by the third consecutive day of  
delays. Not Alvin Tam, a 24-year-old circus performer trying to get 
to Edmonton, Alberta, from Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really care, I'm going to get home eventually,'' Tam  
said. ``The best way to stay sane is to watch all the people 
complaining and you realize it's all just a big Freudian 
experiment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The heavy snow also caused an 8-foot tear in the roof of the  
Pontiac Silverdome, home of pro football's Detroit Lions in 
Pontiac, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Many states struggled to clear roads Monday as the work week  
began. 
</P>
<P>
	In Indiana, where up to 22 inches fell on the northern counties,  
plows created roadside snowbanks higher than cars. Legislative 
leaders postponed the beginning of their 1999 session from today 
until at least Wednesday because of the travel problems. 
</P>
<P>
	In Illinois, which saw similar snow totals in Chicago and  
elsewhere, Gov. Jim Edgar declared the state a disaster area. In 
addition to allowing the state to coordinate state resources to aid 
local governments, the declaration allows eligible counties to seek 
federal help. 
</P>
<P>
	While the snow and cold crippled normal routines for some,  
others went about their typical day. Some even relished in the icy 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just layer yourself real good,'' said Pat Dwyer of  
Cleveland Heights, Ohio, as he went ice fishing Monday on a creek 
at the mouth of Lake Erie. ``I put on three or four pairs of 
underwear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of children were among those enjoying the fringe  
benefits of the storm, as schools were closed for a second day 
today in some states. For some parents, it was an unwelcome 
extension of the holiday vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little stir crazy right now,'' said Carole Johnson, who  
was forced to use a vacation day from her job after schools were 
closed in Dayton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Rismiller watched her two sons, ages 7 and 10, build a snow  
fort in the front yard of the family's Vandalia, Ohio, home. 
</P>
<P>
	``As much as the kids like playing in the snow, I think they're  
ready to go back to school,'' she said. ``They do get a little 
bored. We've watched quite a few movies over the past few days.''

<HEADLINE> Grain Futures Prices Mixed / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain futures prices were mixed and soybean  
futures prices were higher in early trading today on the Chicago 
Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures prices were higher as severe cold continues to  
blanket the Midwest. The cold is expected to increase feed demand 
by cattle ranchers battling to keep their herds from losing weight. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures prices gained on news that rain has not fallen  
in the South American soybean crop area for several days. Despite 
the dryness, the Argentinean soybean crop is in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures prices were mixed, with little news affecting the  
market. The U.S. Agriculture Department this week will bid for 
about 700,000 metric tons of wheat for its donation program. 
However, that has been factored into the market, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery was a 1/4 cent lower at $2.78 3/4 a bushel;  
March corn was 3/4 cent higher at $2.15 1/2 a bushel; March oats were 3/4 
cent higher at $1.08 1/4 a bushel; January soybeans were a 1/4 cent 
higher at $5.44 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle futures prices were mixed and pork futures prices were  
higher in trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	February live cattle were .02 cent lower at 59.60 cents a pound;  
January feeder cattle were .23 cent higher at 68.90 cents a pound; 
February lean hogs were .38 cent hgiher at 31.10 cents a pound; 
February pork bellies were .33 cent higher at 43.10 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Top NBA Pick To Play in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) -- Michael Olowokandi's first pro basketball  
workout was far from the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 1 pick in the June draft practiced with European club  
champion Kinder Bologna Tuesday, hours after signing a contract 
that allows him to return to the United States if the NBA lockout 
ends. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have some catching up to do,'' the 7-foot-1 Nigerian said.  
``Just getting up and down the court and playing some 5-on-5 was 
good. It's much better than not doing anything at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the labor dispute threatening to cancel the NBA season,  
Olowokandi -- whose NBA rights are held by the Los Angeles Clippers 
-- is among a small group of players who have gone overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the (NBA) season does start, I'll be in a good position,''  
said Olowokandi, who was placed on Kinder Bologna's Euro League 
playoff roster Monday, the deadline. ``This will provide a good 
transition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His deal includes an escape clause that allows him to leave if  
the lockout is settled by Feb. 15. The contract is worth about $1.8 
million, with one-third payable even if he exercises the out 
clause. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll step into the lineup immediately, playing Thursday in a  
Euro League playoff game at Greece's PAOK Salonica. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't necessarily have to come in and be the star,'' he  
said. ``I can help out by blocking shots or rebounding. It all 
happened very fast. It would be nice if I knew a month ago I was 
coming here. I would have had time to prepare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi averaged 22.2 points, 11.2 rebounds and 2.9 blocks in  
his final season at Pacific. He has been playing competitively for 
only three years, and has not played organized basketball since 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi ``can definitely give us important minutes and be a  
key player for this team,'' Kinder coach Ettore Messina said. ``But 
he has to find the timing that he had before he was away from the 
game.''

<HEADLINE> Colts Hire Panthers' Fangio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indianapolis Colts didn't have to look  
very hard at Vic Fangio's resume before hiring him as the NFL 
team's defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven of Fangio's 15 years in pro football were as an assistant  
to Jim Mora, now the Colts' coach. The other four were as defensive 
coordinator for the Carolina Panthers, where Colts president Bill 
Polian was the general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is an excellent football coach whose work ethic, experience  
and knowledge will make our football team better,'' Mora said 
Tuesday. ``We share the same opinions of what it takes to play 
great defense in the NFL. I look forward to working alongside him 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fangio, 40, succeeds Rusty Tillman, who was fired last week a  
day after a season-ending loss to the Panthers, the fifth time the 
Colts blew a double-digit lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a respectable showing on offense, where Marshall Faulk  
led the NFL in total yards from scrimmage and earned a starting 
spot in the Pro Bowl, and Peyton Manning was the most productive 
rookie quarterback in NFL history, the Colts finished 3-13 for the 
second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts ranked 29th out of the 30 NFL teams in total defense  
and rushing defense and 16th in passing defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am thrilled to have Vic Fangio join my staff,'' said Mora,  
who also was Fangio's boss with the Philadelphia-Baltimore Stars of 
the United States Football League in 1984-85 and with the New 
Orleans Saints from 1986-94. 
</P>
<P>
	Polian and Mora came to the Colts after the 1997 season, when a  
league-worst 3-13 record allowed them to take Manning as the No. 1 
pick in the 1998 draft. This year, the focus will go to the 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have the kind of defensive personnel to match up in  
the National Football League this year. It's that simple,'' Polian 
said when he fired Tillman. ``We have to get better people on 
defense.''

<HEADLINE> Orioles May Play Games in Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Cubans welcome a plan that could lead to more U.S.  
money, mail and baseball heading their way. 
</P>
<P>
	Especially the baseball.  
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of a visit by the Baltimore Orioles would be the  
first trip by a major league team to this baseball-mad island in 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``How could I not go? I'll be one of the first ones in the  
park,'' said Roman Garcia, wearing a New York Yankees cap at a 
baseball discussion that takes place daily in Havana's Central 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal announced by President Clinton on Tuesday would  
allow more Americans to send money to Cubans, offer direct mail 
service, expand direct charter flights and possibly let the Orioles 
play in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba's state-run news media had not mentioned the proposal and  
the Foreign Ministry declined to comment on foreign news media 
reports, saying it wanted to study the official U.S. version first. 
</P>
<P>
	The baseball exchange is aimed at easing the plight of Cubans  
while maintaining sanctions against the Castro government. The 
measures follow an initiative by Pope John Paul II, who visited 
Cuba a year ago this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration said the games will be allowed only  
if profits go to humanitarian assistance in Cuba and not to Fidel 
Castro's government. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles are expected to send a group to Cuba as early as  
this week to negotiate arrangements for the exhibition games, with 
one in Baltimore and one in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a fount of major league baseball talent, Cuba has been  
largely isolated from U.S. professional baseball since shortly 
after Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution. The U.S. government has 
blocked major league visits to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	A few defectors -- most recently Orlando Hernandez of the Yankees  
-- have made their way to the major leagues, and Cubans have played 
against Latin American major leaguers in games against Dominican 
and other winter league teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cuba is a country that has ballplayers growing like grass,''  
said Garcia, 47, an unemployed driver and former amateur baseball 
player. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, a dozen men arguing baseball said they kept up with  
the major leagues. And they debated who might come with the 
Orioles: Rafael Palmiero? Eric Davis? 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a series of seven games, I would go for the Orioles,''  
said Heriberto Portillo, a bookseller. ``If it's one game, anybody 
could win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia noted that Cuba's team would be in peak form for the  
proposed March or April meeting because its baseball season ends in 
late March, while the U.S. team would be in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said technical issues would have to be settled: Cuba,  
for example, uses metal bats; the U.S. players use wood. 
</P>
<P>
	Portillo, wearing a worn windbreaker against an unusual chill,  
said allowing nonrelatives to send money to Cubans is ``going to 
benefit life here a lot'' because dollars sent to the island 
circulate through the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, which courted Cuban-American  
strongholds in Florida, has refused to lift the economic embargo 
imposed by the United States after Castro took power in 1959. But 
the administration has explored ways to boost contacts with Cubans 
that don't benefit the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles have tried to play exhibition games in Cuba since at  
least 1996, but the Treasury Department has rejected the requests 
as out of line with trade policy.

<HEADLINE> Employee Health Costs Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK -- Throughout the 1990s, companies seeking to control  
rising health costs had an easy solution: Sign their workers up to 
an HMO. 
</P>
<P>
	But things won't be as easy in 1999.  
</P>
<P>
	That because average premium increases for health maintenance  
organizations are rising 8 percent this year, the same rate as 
traditional insurance that has fewer cost controls, according to 
the findings of a national survey being released Wednesday by 
consulting firm Towers Perrin. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, large-employers' health benefit costs are increasing an  
average of 7 percent this year, almost twice the rate of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	While still a far cry from the 14 percent to 18 percent  
increases in the beginning of the decade, the acceleration in costs 
marks the biggest jump since 1993, the year President Clinton made 
his ill-fated national health reform proposal 
</P>
<P>
	``Our findings suggest the easy savings offered by managed care  
may already be behind us,'' said William J. Falk, a principal in 
Towers Perrin's Chicago office. 
</P>
<P>
	HMOs have increased premiums lately to rebuild profits. They've  
cited rising prescription drug prices and the decline in federal 
fees from the Medicare insurance program for the elderly to justify 
the rate hikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of plans, in fact, quit offering health insurance to  
Medicare enrollees this month because they did not believe they 
could profit with the government's reimbursement rate. 
</P>
<P>
	That's creating headaches for those employers that offer health  
benefits to retirees. Some had shifted retirees into HMOs from 
Medicare supplement policies to take advantage of the low or no 
premiums for Medicare HMO coverage in the large retiree markets of 
South Florida and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	While fewer employers provide health insurance coverage to  
retirees, about one-third still offer the benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	Though traditional health insurance and HMO premiums are now  
rising at the same rate, HMOs still are generally 20 percent 
cheaper. And HMOs offer more benefits, including coverage for 
prescription drugs and few, if any, deductibles. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Falk said he expects most employers will stick with  
HMOs and other forms of managed care. ``It still is an attractive 
alternative,'' he said 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 207 employers, primarily large Fortune 100 companies,  
took part in the Towers Perrin survey, which was conducted by mail 
in November. 
</P>
<P>
	A study released this week by Buck Consultants found corporate  
health-benefit costs increasing by 5.6 percent for HMOs, 12.6 
percent for traditional insurance coverage and 9.8 percent for 
preferred-provider plans, a type of managed health care that is 
less restrictive than HMOs. Buck, a New York consulting firm, 
surveyed 25 health insurers.

<HEADLINE> Backstreet Boys Hope for Longevity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The youthful heartthrobs of the Backstreet Boys  
plan on performing together for decades to come. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope to be old people onstage together, as old as the  
Rolling Stones,'' 18-year-old group member Nick Carter said in next 
weekend's edition of USA Weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orlando, Fla.-based quintet's self-entitled debut album sold  
millions of copies last year. The Boys say being adored by millions 
of teen-age girls does have its downside. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're walking in the mall and they scream, then everyone  
comes and your whole shopping day is ruined,'' A.J. McLean said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter said ``screaming is all right. But if you want to  
approach us, come and say, `Hi, we respect your music. That's all 
we're about, music.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Trial Could Halt Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It is a rare moment in Washington: Nobody  
knows if the impeachment drama will freeze the government in 
gridlock while the Senate decides whether the president stays or 
goes or if it will all end quickly in a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	One historian even suggests that lower level officialdom, with  
no one above paying much attention, might seize the initiative. 
That's what happened during a comparable period, from the spring of 
1972 to the summer of 1974, when the capital was embroiled in 
Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
	All three branches of the government -- the executive,  
legislative and judicial -- are rarely involved in the same events, 
but President Clinton's impeachment trial ties them together. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House will devote maximum energy to defending Clinton.  
The Senate will be conducting a trial. And the Supreme Court is 
certain to notice that its chief justice, William Rehnquist, will 
be across the street, presiding over that trial. 
</P>
<P>
	But that may not be the outcome at all. Some senators still are  
trying to figure out how to short-circuit the process, to have a 
quick trial that ends with a quick vote. Other senators want 
nothing less than a full-bore trial, with witnesses, 
cross-examination, presidential testimony, the works. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., suggests a morning-to-evening workday  
until a verdict is rendered. 
</P>
<P>
	During the House impeachment debate last month, stalemate  
scenarios were envisioned, mostly by impeachment opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said a trial could consume  
``perhaps a year.'' Paul Begala, a political adviser to the 
president, predicted that impeachment would lead to chaos. ``This 
is going to make the government shutdown look like a picnic,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government shutdowns were different: In a dispute with  
Clinton, Congress refused to provide money for the everyday 
workings of government. Top officials still came to work, but the 
foot soldiers of government were told to stay home. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the foot soldiers will plod on, doing the everyday  
work that needs no guidance from the top. 
</P>
<P>
	The country may not even notice. After all, the country has  
lived for nearly a year with the scandal and has prospered. What 
happens in Washington seems less crucial than it used to. 
</P>
<P>
	Some senators say they could operate on a two-track system,  
legislation in the morning, trial in the afternoon. No dice, say 
Democrats. ``How can you have a trial impeaching the president of 
the United States and then, in the afternoon or in the morning, 
say, 'Oh, we're going to do Medicare' or 'Let's now do Social 
Security'?'' asked Sen. John Breaux, D-La., over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Political scientist Stephen Wayne of Georgetown University even  
thinks it is possible that both Clinton and congressional 
Republicans could become productive during a trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will see a president taking trips, going to disaster areas,  
welcoming children to the White House,'' Wayne said. ``Whatever 
presidents do, we will see the president doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if the Republicans in Congress ``want to demonstrate that  
they are not mean-spirited,'' he said, they could enact something 
like Clinton's forthcoming proposal to gave a tax break to those 
who take care of the long-term disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate historian Donald Ritchie says preoccupation with the  
president's struggle could give a free hand to lower officials. 
</P>
<P>
	He recalls that in 1974, William Usery Jr., head of the Federal  
Mediation and Conciliation Service,took advantage of President 
Nixon's distraction and ``pushed a very independent-minded and 
progressive labor policy.'' The new president, Gerald Ford, was 
impresssed and made Usery his secretary of labor.

<HEADLINE> Ariz. St. Tailback Redmond Won't Go </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Arizona State tailback J.R. Redmond will  
stay in school instead of leaving for the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came in a winner in the '96 season and I want to leave a  
winner,'' he said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sun Devils went 11-0 in 1996 and won their second Pac-10  
championship before losing to Ohio State in the Rose Bowl. Although 
they lost 15 players who made NFL rosters, Redmond was expected to 
help them contend again. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Redmond turned his ankle in the sixth game this year  
and never completely recovered, and Arizona State skidded to 5-6 in 
a season capped by a 50-42 loss to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Redmond, mentioned as a Heisman Trophy contender before the  
season, ran for 649 yards of his 883 yards before the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Redmond said he was staying with the Sun Devils in part because  
his coaches have been loyal to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't pass my SATs in high school and I went to a JC  
(junior college),'' he said. ``The coaches stayed with me. I want 
to get closer to graduating if not graduate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Redmond, whose 214-yard game against Southern California when he  
was healthy is the ninth-best in Arizona State history, has been 
told he could be a second-round draft pick next April. He said he 
considered the potential loss of salary if he's injured again next 
year, dropping lower in the 2000 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``The downside is you could get injured, he said. ``But these  
things happen, and you could get injured anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides starting at tailback, Redmond also returns punts and  
kickoffs. He had 136 return yards against USC, setting a school 
record with 350 all-purpose yards. 
</P>
<P>
	He also hopes to broaden his play on the defensive unit this  
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Redmond saw spot duty at safety and cornerback last spring and  
wanted to emulate Deion Sanders of the Dallas Cowboys, who sees 
duty on both sides of the ball. The experiment was delayed because 
of his hip and ankle problems this year.

<HEADLINE> Advocates Hope the Euro Succeeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As Europe heralds the birth of its new currency,  
advocates are hoping that the prosperity it could unleash on the 
continent will also spread to the United States and other parts of 
the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	But should the ambitious project falter, critics warn, the  
damage would spread just as easily beyond Europe's borders. 
</P>
<P>
	If the euro strengthens too much against the dollar, it could  
lure global investors away from U.S. financial markets and force 
interest rates higher in America. If the euro weakens sharply 
against the dollar, it could hurt U.S. exporters who would have to 
compete with cheaper goods from European rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Worst of all would be if the whole euro system itself runs into  
trouble. If certain European countries can't abide by the economic 
rules they've set for membership in the currency club, they might 
be forced to pull out of the system, which could lead to financial 
turmoil in Europe and exacerbate the continent's protracted 
unemployment problem. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. government officials have long supported the euro endeavor.  
President Clinton issued a statement welcoming the euro's debut 
Monday, saying ``a strong and stable Europe, with open markets and 
robust growth, is good for America and for the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Having just one currency to deal with instead of 11 could make  
it much easier for U.S. companies to sell products to Europe's 290 
million consumers. And if the euro has the hoped-for effect of 
boosting economic growth, those consumers will be even more likely 
to buy U.S. goods. The more the euro rises against the dollar, the 
more affordable American-made products would be for Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great market opportunity, especially for smaller  
companies who have fewer currencies to deal with,'' said Wolf 
Brueckmann, who handles European affairs for the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce in Washington. ``European consumers will be easily able to 
compare prices, and this will help U.S. companies that are 
competitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, some economists worry that if the euro is  
strong over the long term, it could begin to challenge the dollar's 
position as the world's most widely accepted currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's unchallenged dominance as the global reserve  
currency has had great benefits for the United States, especially 
in the U.S. government bond market. Huge inflows of money from 
foreign investors who have no better place to park their dollars 
have kept bond prices high and interest rates low, keeping 
borrowing costs low for the U.S. government as well as homeowners 
and car buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	But if those international investors had other places to put  
their money, such as a strong European bond market, some say it 
could erode the value of U.S. Treasury bonds, pushing up interest 
rates in America. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the euro is going to be a rival to the dollar,''  
said Clyde Prestowitz, president of the Economic Strategy 
Institute, a public policy research institute. ``It is likely to 
raise interest rates in the U.S. and could result in a somewhat 
weaker dollar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others, however, are doubtful that the mighty dollar can be  
unseated anytime soon as king of the global currencies. During the 
1980s, some feared that the new economic dominance of Japan would 
help push that nation's currency, the yen, to a new status as a 
global reserve currency. But that never came to pass. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this early juncture, it's a little bit naive to believe  
that they've got a super-currency, a dollar-killer,'' said David 
DeRosa, a former currency trader who now teaches international 
finance at the Yale School of Management. 
</P>
<P>
	Of far greater concern, DeRosa says, is the possibility that  
internal economic problems in Europe might lead to a complete or 
partial breakdown of the currency union. 
</P>
<P>
	Possible culprits could include severe regional recessions in  
one or two countries which could tempt governments to ratchet up 
spending in an effort to create jobs. But excessive deficit 
spending is prohibited under the fiscal austerity treaty that the 
11 countries signed in order to keep the currency stable. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the currency project ever breaks up, I look for a meltdown  
in the European bond market and much higher interest rates in 
southern Europe. That could bring on a recession there and then our 
export industries could get hit,'' DeRosa said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should wish our friends in Europe all the best, but this  
euphoria over the euro is unwarranted because the project has 
definite risks to it,'' he said. ``It's going to have benefits as 
long as they can hold it together.''

<HEADLINE> Gov't Wrapping Up Microsoft Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is close to wrapping up its  
antitrust case against Microsoft, preparing to call as its final 
witness an economist who believes the computer software giant 
represents a ``predatory'' monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin Fisher, an economics professor at the Massachusetts  
Institute of Technology, is the government's last announced witness 
in its lengthy antitrust case against Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's lawyers were expected to begin questioning Fisher  
as early as today. Microsoft will begin calling its witnesses -- 
starting with MIT economist Richard Schmalansee -- next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Among its allegations, the government charges that Microsoft  
illegally included its own Internet browsing software within its 
Windows as part of a campaign to ``crush'' rival Netscape 
Communications Corp., which makes competing browser software that 
isn't shipped with Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher, in written testimony, called Microsoft's bundling of its  
Internet software a ``predatory anti-competitive act.'' He also 
told the judge that Microsoft's high market share -- in excess of 80 
percent -- indicates that the company wields monopoly power. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher said Microsoft, using its influence, discouraged Internet  
providers from distributing Netscape's software, and he repeated 
claims that Microsoft sought to stifle emerging rival technologies 
from Intel Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Microsoft is permitted to use its existing monopoly power  
over PC operating systems to monopolize the market for Internet 
browsers -- and thereby to put itself in the position to control and 
ultimately exact a monopoly toll for efficient access to the 
Internet -- the economic costs to consumers and the economy will 
again be substantial,'' Fisher wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft criticized Fisher's testimony as ``littered with  
errors, third-hand information supplied by the DOJ (Department of 
Justice) and excerpts from out-of-context e-mail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft ``cannot charge a monopoly price because it faces  
competition from rival operating systems, potential market 
entrants, its own installed base and pirated software,'' the 
company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher testified on behalf of IBM Corp. during its years-long  
antitrust fight against the Justice Department, when he worked with 
lawyer David Boies, now leading the government's case. The 
department ultimately dropped the IBM case. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft sought to use Fisher's own words against him, quoting  
his 1983 book about IBM when he wrote: ``Conduct that brings 
profitable higher sales cannot be anti-competitive regardless of 
how uncomfortable it makes competitors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Professor Fisher's testimony would give readers of his 1983  
book whiplash,'' Microsoft said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like other witnesses, Fisher submitted his written testimony in  
advance at the request of U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department is under court orders to release  
testimony one day before each witness takes the stand. It announced 
late Monday it was waiting until today to make Fisher's testimony 
public, but Microsoft's point-by-point rebuttal suggested a general 
outline and contained excerpts of the testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision marked the second time during the trial the  
government had failed to publicly release testimony as it was 
obligated to do under court rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, William Harris, chief executive officer for  
Intuit Inc., which makes the popular Quicken personal finance 
software, defended his suggestion that Microsoft be prevented from 
using Windows to favor its own software products. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris asserted that Microsoft holds unparalleled influence in  
the high-tech industry because Windows, which functions as the 
central nervous system for most computers, is an ``essential 
service'' for which ``there is no effective substitute.''

<HEADLINE> Nurses Punished in Overdose Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Eighteen nurses have been punished or face  
disciplinary action for following a doctor's orders in giving 
chemotherapy overdoses to two patients in 1994, one of whom died as 
a result. 
</P>
<P>
	The state nursing registration board is pursuing sanctions  
against the nurses at the renowned Dana-Farber Cancer Institute -- 
even though the state health department, a national hospital 
accrediting agency and the hospital's own investigation team said 
the nurses didn't do anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the Board of Registration in Nursing's decision in  
this case is inappropriate and unwarranted,'' Dana-Farber's 
president, Dr. David G. Nathan, and chief of nursing, Susan Grant, 
said Tuesday in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the decision said the hospital's complicated system  
for prescribing chemotherapy was to blame, not the nurses. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we had was a terrible tragedy caused by lousy systems,''  
said Dr. Lucian Leape, a medical doctor at the Harvard School of 
Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
	``They really had a bad system and they did something about  
it,'' he said, noting Dana-Farber's efforts to revamp its system 
have been ``exemplary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The nurses were merely pawns in this game,'' said Leape.  
</P>
<P>
	But following doctors' orders and established procedures wasn't  
enough to meet the minimum standard of care for nursing, said 
Theresa Bonanno, the nursing board's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently the system in place at the time didn't require the  
nurses to double check, but I think if the nurses made an effort to 
check, were interested in checking or even questioned the dose, 
that wouldn't have happened,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the 18 nurses cited by the state board have signed  
consent agreements to accept probation for one year and to undergo 
additional training. The other 16 face disciplinary hearings and 
could lose their livelihoods. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the board's action questioned why it let the nurses  
practice for so long after the tragedy if it considered them 
incompetent. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they truly did something wrong, why would there have been a  
delay for such a significant period of time?'' asked Frank Reardon, 
the attorney representing all of the nurses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very troubled by the fact that this reopens a wound on  
some very, very competent qualified professionals,'' said Nancy 
Ridley, assistant commissioner for the state Bureau of Health 
Quality Management. 
</P>
<P>
	Leape, who has advised more than 60 hospitals on establishing  
more foolproof systems for patient care, said the decision is a 
setback for patient safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sad thing is it really makes things worse, because it  
makes people tend to hide their mistakes, instead of trying to 
figure out how to make things better,'' he said. ``The last thing 
we need to do is punish people who are victims of bad systems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The overdoses -- four times the appropriate dosages -- killed  
Betsy A. Lehman, 39, a health columnist for The Boston Globe, and 
damaged the heart of Maureen Batemen, 53, a North Andover teacher, 
who died later of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctor who wrote the wrong orders, James Foran, did not  
reapply for his license to practice medicine in Massachusetts and 
now is doing cancer research in London.

<HEADLINE>  NBA Players Will Vote on New Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- David Stern is about to get his wish -- a vote by  
NBA players on the owners' latest proposal to end the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	But union director Billy Hunter doesn't think the commissioner  
will like the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	The union's 19-member negotiating committee will tell players to  
reject the offer, Hunter said, so owners ``understand the level of 
player resolve and the degree of opposition to the NBA's onerous 
demands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If they elect to go against the recommendation, then we'll  
have to live with that,'' Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The union's negotiating committee planned a meeting today,  
probably to discuss the ground rules for Wednesday's general 
membership vote of about 400 players. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern had been calling for a player vote for more than a week,  
and several players broke ranks with union leadership and publicly 
endorsed a secret ballot vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``The majority has a right to control the destiny of an  
organization, and that's between them and their leadership,'' Stern 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine owners on the labor relations committee unanimously  
rejected the union's latest proposal Monday and recommended 
scrapping the rest of the 1998-99 schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern has already designated Thursday as the cutoff day for  
reaching an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	After reviewing the union's proposal, he was anything but  
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I needed to see a proposal that reached for ours. Instead, I  
saw one that went backward,'' Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
	Said deputy commissioner Russ Granik: ``I don't think there will  
be any negotiations about the 1998-99 season if there is no deal by 
Thursday. There's no point then in trying to resuscitate the 
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stern and Granik also said the owners' negotiating committee  
would meet in New York, perhaps Wednesday night. But it was 
uncertain whether it would meet with the players' committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll wait and see what they're going to do,'' union president  
Patrick Ewing said. ``It's all a waiting game right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If no deal is reached, the league's Board of Governors -- with  
one ownership representative from each of the 29 teams -- could vote 
Thursday to scrap the rest of the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based upon how far apart we are, there's a lot more needed to  
be done than simply tweaking the offers,'' Granik said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't anticipate making a deal,'' Stern said. He opened the  
door for using replacement players in the 1999-2000 season by 
saying: ``It's not necessarily a pretty sight early on, but 
obviously if we have to rebuild the league, we'll rebuild the 
league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Stern: ``We're going to lose a season and probably the  
careers of 20 percent of our players. It's a terrible thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stern has said that if the season is scrapped, two rookie  
classes of about 35-40 players each would be on hand once the 
season starts up. That means about 80 of NBA's 400 players would 
lose their jobs to make room for the freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern also said that if a new league was formed, it would  
probably take the top 100 players and leave the rest out of work. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA, which was supposed to begin its season Nov. 3, had  
never lost a game to labor strife until this season. So far, the 
first two months of the season have been wiped out. It would take 
three to four weeks after a settlement to begin a season of 45 to 
50 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Herb Williams of the Knicks, a member of the union's executive  
committee, thinks the deadline might be extended. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a deal was done on the 9th or 10th, I'm sure David wouldn't  
say that just because we didn't do it on the 7th the season is 
over. It's a business, and sometimes you have to posture,'' 
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	The union's new offer included a limit on how much any player  
can earn. If accepted, the NBA would be the only professional 
sports league to limit the amount of money a top athlete is paid. 
</P>
<P>
	The key sticking point could center on how much revenue will be  
paid to the players during the six-year deal. The sides also differ 
on the length and terms of a new rookie salary scale and the dollar 
value of two salary cap exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	In its proposal, the union wants 55 percent of revenue devoted  
to salaries in the fourth year, while owners have offered 53 
percent. In the fifth year, players want 56 percent while owners 
are offering 53.5. And in the final year, players want 57 percent -- 
the amount they received last season -- while the league is offering 
54 percent.

<HEADLINE>  NBA Owners Reject Union's Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- David Stern is about to get his wish -- a vote by  
NBA players on the owners' latest proposal to end the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	But union director Billy Hunter doesn't think the commissioner  
will like the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	The union's 19-member negotiating committee will tell players to  
reject the offer, Hunter said, so owners ``understand the level of 
player resolve and the degree of opposition to the NBA's onerous 
demands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If they elect to go against the recommendation, then we'll  
have to live with that,'' Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The union's negotiating committee planned a meeting today,  
probably to discuss the ground rules for Wednesday's general 
membership vote of about 400 players. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern had been calling for a player vote for more than a week,  
and several players broke ranks with union leadership and publicly 
endorsed a secret ballot vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``The majority has a right to control the destiny of an  
organization, and that's between them and their leadership,'' Stern 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine owners on the labor relations committee unanimously  
rejected the union's latest proposal Monday and recommended 
scrapping the rest of the 1998-99 schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern has already designated Thursday as the cutoff day for  
reaching an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	After reviewing the union's proposal, he was anything but  
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I needed to see a proposal that reached for ours. Instead, I  
saw one that went backward,'' Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
	Said deputy commissioner Russ Granik: ``I don't think there will  
be any negotiations about the 1998-99 season if there is no deal by 
Thursday. There's no point then in trying to resuscitate the 
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stern and Granik also said the owners' negotiating committee  
would meet in New York, perhaps Wednesday night. But it was 
uncertain whether it would meet with the players' committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll wait and see what they're going to do,'' union president  
Patrick Ewing said. ``It's all a waiting game right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If no deal is reached, the league's Board of Governors -- with  
one ownership representative from each of the 29 teams -- could vote 
Thursday to scrap the rest of the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based upon how far apart we are, there's a lot more needed to

three to four weeks after a settlement to begin a season of 45 to 
50 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't anticipate making a deal,'' Stern said, opening the  
door for the first time to using replacement players in the 
1999-2000 season. ``It's not necessarily a pretty sight early on, 
but obviously if we have to rebuild the league, we'll rebuild the 
league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stern said if a new league was formed, it would probably take  
the top 100 players and leave the rest -- the middle-class that the 
union has said it's fighting for -- out of work. 
</P>
<P>
	Herb Williams of the Knicks, a member of the union's executive  
committee, thinks the deadline might be extended.

<HEADLINE> Israel on Alert for Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- For Israelis, 1999 began with the unveiling of  
a formerly secret security force called the ``millennium unit,'' 
whose agents raided two suburban homes to arrest American doomsday 
cultists. 
</P>
<P>
	But few were surprised at the revelation of the special unit --  
comprised of police and agents from two Israeli spy services. This 
is, after all, the land that will host the 2,000th anniversary of 
Jesus' birth. 
</P>
<P>
	From believers in what some call the End of Days to territorial  
wars over bits of holy land, Israeli authorities face a year of 
potential conflicts between Christians, Jews and Muslims, and even 
between Christians themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The millennial news is mostly good for Israel, presenting the  
potential for a tourism boom. The four million Christian pilgrims 
expected to visit Israel between mid-1999 and the end of 2000 will 
double the annual tourist trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of those pilgrims are expected to seek a peaceful,  
religious experience. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sunday's arrest of 14 members of a Denver-based cult  
underscored the dangers of the coming year. The cultists, who call 
themselves the Concerned Christians, are alleged to have planned 
violent acts in hopes of precipitating the apocalypse. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing more powerful than believing that you live at  
the end of time,'' said Richard Landes, a director of Boston 
University's Center for Millennium Studies. 
</P>
<P>
	A Jerusalem psychiatrist predicted that some 40,000 tourists  
will require psychiatric help and that as many as 800 will need to 
be hospitalized, the Haaretz daily said today. The doctor, Yair 
Bar-El, first identified the so-called Jerusalem Syndrome, which 
describes the symptoms of patients who begin suffering from 
delusions that they are biblical figures once they set foot in the 
Holy City. 
</P>
<P>
	Landes identified what he termed a ``hard core'' of tens of  
thousands of apocalyptic pilgrims who say that Christ's return to 
Jerusalem is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	That group is likely to pressure hundreds of thousands of others  
who are drawn to the idea of the apocalypse but are less rigid in 
their views. 
</P>
<P>
	The dynamic between the groups of pilgrims and how they are  
received by Israeli authorities will ultimately determine whether 
the millennial ceremonies will be violent or peaceful, Landes said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you handle it badly it's like shaking nitroglycerin -- it  
will blow up in your face,'' he said in a phone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who are preparing for the Second Coming are about  
100 evangelical North Americans who have moved to apartments on the 
Mount of Olives, for a close-up view of the prophesied return of 
Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
	Brother Solomon, 65, a retired schoolteacher from New York,  
moved to the area six years ago to prepare for the Second Coming. 
</P>
<P>
	``God's headquarters will be in Jerusalem, and our coming is  
helping this be fulfilled,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In booming, hopeful tones, Brother Solomon listed what he saw as  
the signals of the violence that could precipitate Jesus' return. 
They include a unilateral declaration of statehood by Palestinian 
leader Yasser Arafat -- a step the Israeli government has warned 
could crush the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
	Differences among Christians on how to celebrate the millennium  
have stymied efforts by Israel's Ministry of Religion to create a 
new exit for visitors at the labyrinthine Church of the Holy 
Sepulcher, which marks the site where, tradition says, Jesus was 
buried. 
</P>
<P>
	Various Christian groups and denominations control different  
parts of the church in Jerusalem's walled Old City. Clerics have 
traded punches in earlier turf wars at the site, and are now 
steeped in argument on where to place a new exit door. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nazareth, the town of Jesus' boyhood, similar territorial  
wars -- this time, between Muslims and Christians -- prompted a 
fistfight at a recent city council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The tensions grew from plans to tear down a school and build a  
pedestrian square in the crowded city's center to accommodate the 
anticipated rush of pilgrims. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the days of celebration -- Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve  
-- have the potential for conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Both holidays fall on Friday nights, the start of the Jewish  
Sabbath, and Israel's rabbinate has indicated it would revoke the 
kosher licenses of any hotels that cater to Christian groups on the 
holidays.

	Modem Maker Hayes Shuts Down  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Hayes Corp., a company that once dominated the  
personal-computer modem business, is shutting down after failing to 
find a buyer. Some 250 employees were laid off, leaving only a 
handful from a peak of 1,200. The company sought protection from 
creditors in October, in its second trip to Bankruptcy Court in the 
1990s, and attempted a reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code as it talked to potential buyers. But its primary 
lender notified the company it wouldn't continue funding efforts to 
keep Hayes alive. Company shares fell 0.055 to 0.045.

European service for the summer of 1999, including Atlanta's first 
nonstop service to Athens, Barcelona and Istanbul. Delta also this 
summer will introduce service from New York's Kennedy Airport to 
Ireland, with nonstop flights to Dublin and Shannon. Delta is 
seeking federal authority to operate an Atlanta-Rome nonstop

conventional computer design by unveiling four bright new colors 
for its popular iMac desktop machine. The iMac is now available in 
red, orange, purple, and green as well as its original color, teal. 
Steve Jobs, Apple's interim chief executive, announced the new 
colors at the annual MacWorld show. He also revealed that the price

as investors disagreed over whether the figures were in line with 
their expectations. The Seattle-based company reported that its 
quarterly sales more than tripled from a year ago to about $250 
million, well above most forecasts. But some analysts were still 
disappointed since they had quietly hoped for an even bigger rise 
in sales during the quarter, to about $300 million. Amazon shares 
rose 6 3/16 to 124 1/2, reflecting a 3-for-1 stock split that took 
effect Tuesday.

provide text, audio and video to AOL, the world's largest online 
service, and its affiliated CompuServe service. The financial terms 
were not disclosed. The companies said only that it is a multiyear 
agreement. The deal is a huge boost for CBS as it tries to catch up 
with news organizations such as NBC, CNN and ABC that are more 
established on the Internet. Shares in CBS Corp. rose 3/4 to 32 5/8. 
Disney, which owns ABC, rose 1 to 30 9/16. Shares in AOL fell 2

<HEADLINE>  NBA Players Will Vote on New Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- David Stern is about to get his wish -- a vote by  
NBA players on the owners' latest proposal to end the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	But union director Billy Hunter doesn't think the commissioner  
will like the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	The union's 19-member negotiating committee will tell players to

	``If they elect to go against the recommendation, then we'll  
have to live with that,'' Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The union's negotiating committee planned a meeting today,  
probably to discuss the ground rules for Wednesday's general 
membership vote of about 400 players. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern had been calling for a player vote for more than a week,

endorsed a secret ballot vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``The majority has a right to control the destiny of an

said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine owners on the labor relations committee unanimously  
rejected the union's latest proposal Monday and recommended 
scrapping the rest of the 1998-99 schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern has already designated Thursday as the cutoff day for

</P>
<P>
	If no deal is reached, the league's Board of Governors -- with  
one ownership representative from each of the 29 teams -- could vote 
Thursday to scrap the rest of the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based upon how far apart we are, there's a lot more needed to  
be done than simply tweaking the offers,'' Granik said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't anticipate making a deal,'' Stern said. He opened the  
door for using replacement players in the 1999-2000 season by 
saying: ``It's not necessarily a pretty sight early on, but 
obviously if we have to rebuild the league, we'll rebuild the 
league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Stern: ``We're going to lose a season and probably the  
careers of 20 percent of our players. It's a terrible thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stern has said that if the season is scrapped, two rookie  
classes of about 35-40 players each would be on hand once the 
season starts up. That means about 80 of NBA's 400 players would 
lose their jobs to make room for the freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern also said that if a new league was formed, it would  
probably take the top 100 players and leave the rest out of work. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA, which was supposed to begin its season Nov. 3, had  
never lost a game to labor strife until this season. So far, the 
first two months of the season have been wiped out. It would take 
three to four weeks after a settlement to begin a season of 45 to 
50 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Herb Williams of the Knicks, a member of the union's executive  
committee, thinks the deadline might be extended. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a deal was done on the 9th or 10th, I'm sure David wouldn't  
say that just because we didn't do it on the 7th the season is 
over. It's a business, and sometimes you have to posture,'' 
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	The union's new offer included a limit on how much any player  
can earn. If accepted, the NBA would be the only professional 
sports league to limit the amount of money a top athlete is paid. 
</P>
<P>
	The key sticking point could center on how much revenue will be  
paid to the players during the six-year deal. The sides also differ 
on the length and terms of a new rookie salary scale and the dollar 
value of two salary cap exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	In its proposal, the union wants 55 percent of revenue devoted  
to salaries in the fourth year, while owners have offered 53 
percent. In the fifth year, players want 56 percent while owners 
are offering 53.5. And in the final year, players want 57 percent -- 
the amount they received last season -- while the league is offering 
54 percent.

	``If they elect to go against the recommendation, then we'll  
have to live with that,'' Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The union's negotiating committee planned a meeting today,  
probably to discuss the ground rules for Wednesday's general 
membership vote of about 400 players. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern had been calling for a player vote for more than a week,  
and several players broke ranks with union leadership and publicly 
endorsed a secret ballot vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``The majority has a right to control the destiny of an  
organization, and that's between them and their leadership,'' Stern 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine owners on the labor relations committee unanimously  
rejected the union's latest proposal Monday and recommended 
scrapping the rest of the 1998-99 schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern has already designated Thursday as the cutoff day for  
reaching an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	After reviewing the union's proposal, he was anything but  
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I needed to see a proposal that reached for ours. Instead, I  
saw one that went backward,'' Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
	Said deputy commissioner Russ Granik: ``I don't think there will  
be any negotiations about the 1998-99 season if there is no deal by 
Thursday. There's no point then in trying to resuscitate the 
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stern and Granik also said the owners' negotiating committee  
would meet in New York, perhaps Wednesday night. But it was 
uncertain whether it would meet with the players' committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll wait and see what they're going to do,'' union president  
Patrick Ewing said. ``It's all a waiting game right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If no deal is reached, the league's Board of Governors -- with  
one ownership representative from each of the 29 teams -- could vote 
Thursday to scrap the rest of the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based upon how far apart we are, there's a lot more needed to  
be done than simply tweaking the offers,'' Granik said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA, which was supposed to begin its season Nov. 3, had  
never lost a game to labor strife until this season. So far, the 
first two months of the season have been wiped out. It would take 
three to four weeks after a settlement to begin a season of 45 to 
50 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't anticipate making a deal,'' Stern said, opening the  
door for the first time to using replacement players in the 
1999-2000 season. ``It's not necessarily a pretty sight early on, 
but obviously if we have to rebuild the league, we'll rebuild the 
league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stern said if a new league was formed, it would probably take  
the top 100 players and leave the rest -- the middle-class that the 
union has said it's fighting for -- out of work. 
</P>
<P>
	Herb Williams of the Knicks, a member of the union's executive  
committee, thinks the deadline might be extended. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a deal was done on the 9th or 10th, I'm sure David wouldn't  
say that just because we didn't do it on the 7th the season is 
over. It's a business, and sometimes you have to posture,'' 
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	The union's new offer included a limit on how much any player  
can earn. If accepted, the NBA would be the only professional 
sports league to limit the amount of money a top athlete is paid. 
</P>
<P>
	The key sticking point could center on how much revenue will be  
paid to the players during the six-year deal. The sides also differ 
on the length and terms of a new rookie salary scale and the dollar 
value of two salary cap exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	In its proposal, the union wants 55 percent of revenue devoted  
to salaries in the fourth year, while owners have offered 53 
percent. In the fifth year, players want 56 percent while owners 
are offering 53.5. And in the final year, players want 57 percent -- 
the amount they received last season -- while the league is offering 
54 percent.

<HEADLINE> Holmgren Begins Tour of NFL Teams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- The Mike Holmgren whirlwind tour is  
headed for Seattle, Baltimore and Philadelphia as he searches for a 
team that will give him total control. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks appear to be the strongest suitor for the Green Bay  
Packers coach, but he denied he was close to signing with them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just finished our season Sunday and I really expected our  
season to last longer,'' Holmgren said Tuesday. ``The clubs 
contacted the Packers yesterday. Now the process starts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One city conspicuously missing from Holmgren's travel itinerary  
is Cleveland. Browns president Carmen Policy, who worked with 
Holmgren in San Francisco, was fined $10,000 last month by the NFL 
for tampering after alluding to the coach during a civic luncheon. 
But the expansion team has not yet contacted Holmgren for a formal 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren, who said he didn't expect interest from any other  
teams, will fly to Seattle on Wednesday, Baltimore on Friday and 
Philadelphia on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be one of those whirlwind tours,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He indicated, however, that he might cancel those other visits  
if the Seahawks make him an ideal offer that allows him to be coach 
and general manager. Seattle, owned by Microsoft co-founder and 
billionaire Paul Allen, is loaded with young talent, has a new 
stadium planned for 2002 and is willing to play the free-agent 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	He also emphasized his happiness working with Packers general  
manager Ron Wolf and said he still might decide to stay in Green 
Bay and sign an extension that would make him the NFL's 
highest-paid coach at about $4 million a season. The offer has been 
on the table since August. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't imagine a better working relationship between two men  
in our positions in football or in any professional sport,'' 
Holmgren said about Wolf, who hired the coach in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great, great football job, here. So, why am I even  
considering any of this other stuff? Because of the challenge and 
I've always tried to push myself to limits and extend myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren said even if he decides to stay in Green Bay, he'd  
still want to be a general manager someday. The coach has guided 
the Packers to six straight postseason berths, two Super Bowls, one 
NFL championship and an 84-42 record in seven seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks fired coach Dennis Erickson last month and team  
president Bob Whitsitt said he hasn't ruled out hiring one man to 
serve as coach and GM. In that case, Randy Mueller, vice president 
of football operations, would probably have to change his role. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren said running his own show is more than choosing his own  
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's your organization,'' he said. ``And there's quite a  
challenge there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks, Ravens and Eagles contacted Wolf on Monday for  
permission to talk with Holmgren, who has a year left on his 
contract but can use an escape clause before Jan. 25 to be a 
coach-GM with another team. 
</P>
<P>
	But Holmgren, who said his wife, Kathy, and daughter Gretchen,  
17, would accompany him on his visits, hopes to have his future 
decided by next week. 
</P>
<P>
	If he stays, Holmgren said he'd sign the extension rather than  
put himself and the club through another year of speculation. But 
he disagreed that his uncertain future hurt the Packers, who fell 
from the Super Bowl to 11-6 also-rans, losing Sunday to the 49ers 
in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think injuries hurt the team,'' Holmgren said. ``That's what  
hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf said the Chicago Bears were granted permission to talk to  
offensive coordinator Sherm Lewis and the Eagles were given the OK 
to interview quarterbacks coach Andy Reid about their head coaching 
vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were considered possible replacements for Holmgren, but  
Wolf told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that the successor he has 
in mind isn't on the Packers staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the person was available now, Wolf said, ``Not right  
now he's not.'' That would seem to indicate he's considering a head 
coach or an assistant with a team still in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Packers president Bob Harlan said he hopes Holmgren stays but  
won't begrudge him for leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him, `I know what your goal is, if it happens, we would  
just thank you for what you've done here and wish you well,''' 
Harlan said.

<HEADLINE> Most Prisoners Have Used Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seven of every 10 federal prisoners had used  
drugs prior to their arrests, and one-fifth were on drugs at the 
time they committed the crime that sent them to prison, the Justice 
Department reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	In conjunction with the release of the department's Bureau of  
Justice Statistics figures, which are up from 1991 levels, 
President Clinton said his fiscal 2000 budget would include $215 
million to test and treat prisoners for drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	``Drug use stokes all kinds of crime,'' Clinton said today in a  
White House ceremony. ``It is clear to us that if we're going to 
continue to reduce the rate of crime we have to do something to 
avoid releasing criminals with their dangerous drug habits 
intact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If approved by Congress, the money would represent an increase  
of about $100 million over funds currently available to enforce 
``zero tolerance'' of drug use by prisoners, parolees and 
probationers. 
</P>
<P>
	White House drug policy director Barry McCaffrey said an  
untreated addict costs taxpayers about $43,000 per year, while 
prison-based treatment for an individual's drug use annually costs 
$2,700. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey called the president's proposed budget increase ``a  
no-brainer for smart drug policy, for smart incarceration policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice report found that 70 percent of federal prisoners  
had used drugs, and 22 percent used them at the time of the 
offense. In 1991, 60 percent of federal prisoners said they had 
used drugs, and 17 percent used them at the time of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Percentages of state prisoners using drugs were higher. In 1997,  
83 percent said they had used drugs, up from 79 percent in 1991. 
And 33 percent used them at the time of the crime, up from 31 
percent in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also announced today the release of $120 million in  
funds already approved for drug-free prison initiatives this year. 
About $63 million is earmarked for state prisons to provide 
long-term drug treatment and intensive supervision for prisoners 
with the most serious drug problems.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Gov. Floats Admissions Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A year after the end of affirmative  
action at the University of California, Gov. Gray Davis is 
proposing to ``ensure diversity and fair play'' by guaranteeing 
admission to the top 4 percent of students at each high school in 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrat announced the proposal at his inauguration Monday  
in an attempt to soften the effect of affirmative action bans 
imposed during the tenure of Republican Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, UC, with 129,000 students at eight undergraduate  
campuses, admits the top 12.5 percent of all high school graduates 
statewide, an applicant pool that tends to be filled with students 
from affluent, top-performing schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal to take 4 percent from every school could be a boon  
to blacks and Hispanics at inner-city that send few students to 
college. But it may also benefit nearly as many whites as 
minorities, since whites in rural districts also are 
underrepresented in the UC student population. 
</P>
<P>
	The new proposal also would change the way graduates are ranked  
by putting less emphasis on standardized verbal and math exams and 
more weight on SAT2 scores, which tests students' knowledge in 
three subjects of their choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking auto repair to inflate a GPA won't help, however.  
Students still must complete college-preparatory courses to 
qualify. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that it will result in a student body that is more  
representative of the state's diverse population without 
sacrificing academic excellence,'' said Charles McFadden, spokesman 
for the UC system. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal is meant in part as a response to a 9.5 percent  
decline in enrollment of blacks, Hispanics and American Indians 
that took place after the UC Board of Regents voted in 1995 to ban 
affirmative action. The ban first affected undergraduates applying 
for fall 1998 admission. 
</P>
<P>
	California voters later endorsed a similar initiative that  
applied to the California State University system with passage of 
Proposition 209, which took effect in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will seek to ensure diversity and fair play by guaranteeing  
to those students who truly excel by graduating in the top 4 
percent of their high school -- whether it's in West Los Angeles or 
East Palo Alto,'' Davis said. ``Those kids who excel will 
automatically be admitted to the University of California.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal is subject to approval by California's 26-member  
Board of Regents, though the first Democratic governor in 16 years 
will have considerable influence. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only does Davis preside over the board, but three fellow  
Democrats also sit on the board, and he can appoint 10 members 
during the next four years. A vote by the regents is scheduled for 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward Connerly, a black regent who was appointed by Wilson and  
led the campaign to end affirmative action, said that he has yet to 
make up his mind about the 4 percent proposal but that he is 
considering supporting it because it might motivate low-income 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is very little culture of achievement in low-income  
neighborhoods, especially a culture of academic achievement,'' he 
said. ``This could put a prize out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, he said that unless the state also provided  
more financial aid, the proposal would probably be of more benefit 
to white rural students than inner-city blacks and Hispanics. And 
he said he fears a dumbing-down of UC. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you admit the top 4 percent at every high school, while  
that sounds good politically, the effect is that without a doubt it 
does amount to a relaxing of the statewide standards,'' Connerly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	After a federal appeals court struck down affirmative action in  
admissions at the University of Texas law school, the UT system 
began accepting the top 10 percent of each high school last fall. 
Officials there said Tuesday that it's too soon to say whether this 
has lowered the quality of the student body. 
</P>
<P>
	At UC, there were 4,161 blacks, Hispanics and American Indians  
enrolled as undergraduates last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	McFadden acknowledged the proposal would probably increase  
minority enrollment by only 1 percent. And students wouldn't 
necessarily get the UC school of their choice. UCLA, Berkeley and 
Davis would probably remain the state's most elite public 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Kevin Fisher, who teaches drama, German and French at an  
inner-city school in San Bernardino, said he thinks the guarantee 
might be just the thing to inspire his students. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a few of the mostly poor, black students at Pacific High  
School make it into the UC system, and teachers have to work hard 
just to keep youngsters from dropping out. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives them a special chance. They're just not left out in  
the cold,'' Fisher said. ``They could see something, a light at the 
end of the tunnel.''

<HEADLINE> Panthers Name Seifert As New Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- George Seifert spent his first stint in  
the NFL trying to maintain a championship team. He'll spend his 
second trying to build one. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert was introduced Monday as the new leader of the Carolina  
Panthers, a 4-year-old franchise that has fallen on hard times 
since advancing to the NFC championship game in just its second 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers are coming off their worst year yet, one in which  
they were hampered by injuries, finished 4-12 and had to deal with 
several distractions by players. Quarterback Kerry Collins, 
Carolina's first draft choice, was cut amid questions about his 
commitment, and linebacker Kevin Greene, regarded as a team leader, 
was suspended for attacking an assistant coach on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a stark contrast from 1989, when Seifert took over as the  
head coach in San Francisco. The 49ers were coming off their third 
Super Bowl title in seven years and had a roster peppered with the 
likes of Ronnie Lott, Joe Montana, Jerry Rice and Steve Young. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers don't appear to have any guaranteed future Hall of  
Famers on their roster, but Seifert is nonetheless confident he can 
get Carolina back on track. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what the expectations are,'' he said. ``I'm used to  
going into the season saying, `Hey, we're going after a Super 
Bowl.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert, 58, will be Carolina's head coach and will have the  
final say in all personnel matters. The Panthers gave him a 
five-year contract worth an average of more than $2.4 million 
annually, according to sources who spoke on condition they not be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Team owner Jerry Richardson said the only candidate he seriously  
considered was Seifert, who in eight seasons with San Francisco won 
76 percent of his games (108-35), the best winning percentage in 
NFL history. Under Seifert's direction, the 49ers won two Super 
Bowl titles and never won less than 10 games in a season, numbers 
that Richardson found impossible to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we'll be very compatible,'' the owner said. ``He's a  
very focused person and he clearly understands what our 
expectations are. There's no misunderstanding. We want to do 
everything we can to create an environment to win football games, 
pure and simple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert's hiring came eight days after the Panthers fired Dom  
Capers, who helped them achieve unprecedented success for NFL 
expansion teams but was unable to sustain an early wave of 
momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	It appeared as if Seifert's NFL resume was finished when he left  
the 49ers after the 1996 season. He spent two years fishing, hiking 
and traveling with his wife, Linda, and dabbled as a television 
analyst for NFL games. 
</P>
<P>
	But Seifert said he never lost the desire to coach.  
</P>
<P>
	``The last couple of years I've kind of been living in a gray  
twilight,'' he said. ``It's an empty feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That feeling passed when he met with Richardson last Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``There was a sense and a feeling that I was at home,'' Seifert  
said. ``I was at peace with myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert's decision to return to coaching didn't surprise his  
wife. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to do something for so long that you love and then  
completely stop, even though the break was good and came at a good 
time. He needed it,'' Linda Seifert said. ``But he's ready. He's 
ready now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband takes over a team that unseated the 49ers for the  
1996 NFC West title on the way to a 13-5 season that ended in the 
NFC title game. Carolina has lost 21 of 32 since then, including 
nine losses this season by a touchdown or less. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert said he wants the Panthers to throw the ball more but  
stay with their West Coast-style controlled passing offense, a 
strategy that worked well in his days at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensively, changes are likely for a team that finished at the  
bottom of the NFL rankings in 1998. Seifert said the Panthers' 3-4 
alignment may not be completely scrapped but could share a 
significant amount of time with a more conventional 4-3 set, 
depending on how Carolina's personnel fit in with his plans. 
</P>
<P>
	But for now, Seifert's primary task is to get reacquainted with  
a league in which he worked for 17 years, all in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``I loved it. It was the city where I grew up, and then to  
become the head football coach, that's a unique situation,'' he 
said. ``But I've done that. I've been there. It would seem like 
there has to be something else.''

<HEADLINE> Dolphins' Corners Ready To Gamble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Miami Dolphins cornerbacks Sam Madison and  
Terrell Buckley will gamble again Saturday, and they like their 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
	The two defenders plan to line up in the faces of the Denver  
Broncos' receivers, hoping they can take away John Elway's favorite 
targets in the second-round playoff game at Mile High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	It's risky business, but the two defenders have been in the face  
of opposing receivers all season, which is one reason Miami allowed 
the fewest points in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison and Buckley were at their best against Denver on Dec.  
21, when Elway went just 13-for-36 for 151 yards in the Broncos' 
31-21 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're two great players,'' Elway said Tuesday. ``If there  
were snubs for the Pro Bowl, those were the two guys who got 
snubbed, because they're great players and a big key to that 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Dolphins ask them to do a lot. They put them out there on  
an island, and they play well out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the cornerback tandem didn't make the Pro Bowl, Madison  
was second-team All-Pro. He and Buckley each made eight 
interceptions, which tied for second in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jimmy Johnson defends Buckley's eagerness to risk giving  
up big plays. And Johnson calls second-year pro Madison the best 
cornerback he has coached. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have Deion Sanders so, yes, he's the best,'' Johnson  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's switch this season to so-called press coverage -- as  
opposed to lining up 7 to 10 yards deep last year -- brought 
dramatic results. Interceptions rose from 10 in 1997 to 29, an NFL 
high, and the opposing completion percentage fell from 62 to 50, an 
NFL low. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been doing the same thing all year,'' Madison said.  
``People say we hold and grab, but we get it done every week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo quarterback Doug Flutie last week accused the Miami  
cornerbacks of chronic holding. Madison responded by saying the 
Dolphins would stuff Flutie Flakes down Flutie's throat, and 
following a 24-17 victory Saturday, the Dolphins celebrated by 
stomping on the cereal. 
</P>
<P>
	This week's bulletin-board barb came from Broncos tight end  
Shannon Sharpe. Following last month's lost at Miami, Sharpe said: 
``We are 10 or 14 points better than that football team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Madison responded Tuesday: ``We feel we're a much better team  
than them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Madison and Buckley will be trying to contain a pair of  
1,000-yard receivers, Rod Smith and Pro Bowl starter Ed McCaffrey. 
But if the Broncos employ the tactics of Miami's recent opponents, 
they'll use frequent four- and five-receiver sets and try to 
isolate Elway's top targets on lesser defenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people look at our secondary and see what we're doing,  
they want to spread us out and work on everybody, not just those 
two corners,'' Johnson said. ``You don't see a lot of balls thrown 
on them unless it's the deep play-action against Terrell, because 
he does gamble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buckley has been burned frequently this season, especially  
lately. Buffalo's Eric Moulds set an NFL playoff record Saturday 
with 240 receiving yards, many of them against Buckley. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were trying to mix it up by going deep,'' Buckley said.  
``They really haven't gone deep that much, so we had to adjust. But 
we did adjust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, Buffalo scored just 17 points. Because the Bills  
abandoned the running game, they had the ball for less than 23 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes that's not the worst thing in the world for us -- to  
get them out of their game,'' Johnson said.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's impeachment trial will  
begin Thursday, although agreement eluded party leaders on the 
length of the proceeding or whether witnesses will be summoned to 
the Senate chamber to testify. ``It has to be done not only 
expeditiously, but fairly,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said 
after meeting with Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle and Chief

living longer, they're working longer, they're healthier than they 
were, and they're receiving benefits longer than they were,'' said 
Sen. John Breaux, D-La. By March 1, the commission must agree on 
recommendations to keep Medicare afloat for the huge baby boom

southern Iraq on today in the first such air confrontation in more 
than six years. The Iraqis ``beat a hasty retreat'' following the 
early morning clashes, which occurred in two separate incidents 
just 15 minutes and 62 miles apart, the Pentagon said. In all, 
between 13 to 15 Iraqi aircraft attempted to violate the no-fly

<HEADLINE> Son May Have Stolen Red Wings' Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) -- The son of the owner of the Detroit Red  
Wings told police he believes his brother stole his 1995 Stanley 
Cup ring and gold-plated team watch from his hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Ilitch, 41, who is from Troy, Mich., said his brother  
Michael has a cocaine habit and had stolen property from family 
members to pawn for drug money, according to a police report 
released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ilitch reported Friday his wallet, the ring made of gold and  
diamonds and a gold-plated Hockey Town Detroit Red Wings watch were 
taken from his room at the Boca Raton Resort &AMP; Hotel, police said. 
The Red Wings lost in the 1995 Stanley Cup finals to New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	The jewelry was worth $20,510, according to the police report.  
</P>
<P>
	Ilitch said he left the property on the desk in his room at the  
resort. During the time he was gone, Ilitch said, his brother had a 
key to his room. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ronald feels that Michael took the ring as Michael is having  
problems with drugs,'' the police report said. ``According to 
Ronald, Michael has in the past stolen property from family members 
and has pawned his Detroit Red Wings ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one had been arrested and the case remained under  
investigation Tuesday, said Debra Shannon, a spokeswoman for the 
Boca Raton police. Michael Ilitch left soon after the theft for a 
wedding in Colorado Springs, Colo., his brother told police. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald and Michael Ilitch are the sons of Mike Ilitch, who also  
owns the Detroit Tigers and the Little Caesars pizza chain. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Ilitch's telephone number is unpublished and a message  
left with the Red Wings for Mike Ilitch was not immediately 
returned.

<HEADLINE> Fugitive Computer Hacker Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A computer hacker-turned-government informant  
who claimed to have helped put superhacker Kevin Mitnick behind 
bars is back in custody after being on the run for more than three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Justin Petersen, 38, was accused of leaving a halfway house in  
August and could get up to two years in prison. The man known as 
``Agent Steal'' among hackers was captured without incident Dec. 11 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Petersen, a native of Lincoln, Neb., pleaded guilty in 1993 to  
federal computer crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	He admitted stealing data from a credit information firm,  
hacking into a financial services business to pay himself $150,000 
and helping rig a radio call-in contest by seizing control of 
telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	He got nearly 3 1/2 years in prison and three years of supervised  
release. But his sentence was delayed while he helped the 
government in an ``undercover capacity,'' as one court document put 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Petersen claimed the FBI paid his rent and flew him to computer  
conferences to spy on other hackers. He also said he helped show 
that Mitnick, the only hacker to make the FBI's most wanted list, 
was committing offenses while on probation for computer crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitnick was arrested in 1995, accused of stealing 20,000 credit  
card numbers. He faces trial in Los Angeles on April 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Petersen was completing his sentence in halfway house in the Los  
Angeles area when he went on the run. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer, Nathan Hochman, said his client ``hasn't admitted or  
denied the allegations yet.''

<HEADLINE> FDA OKs Two Drugs for Dogs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A dog's life may be getting a little better:  
They're about to get two new drugs to treat two vexing canine 
health problems, separation anxiety and an Alzheimer's-like disease 
that plagues old dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Canine cognitive dysfunction syndrome, or CDS, is a newly  
recognized disease -- veterinarians once simply told dog lovers that 
acting senile was a normal part of a dog's aging. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they look for a number of specific symptoms: Older dogs get  
confused, stop interacting with family members, stay awake all 
night, pace, or lose their house training and inappropriately 
urinate. As many as 62 percent of dogs over age 10 may experience 
at least one of the symptoms, said Dr. Edward W. Kanara of Pfizer 
Animal Health. 
</P>
<P>
	Vets have had little to offer except behavior therapy. But now  
the Food and Drug Administration has approved the first drug 
treatment, Pfizer's Anipryl. 
</P>
<P>
	Anipryl is the chemical selegiline, which is used by humans to  
treat Parkinson's disease. But when researchers tried it in a study 
of 199 dogs with severe cognitive dysfunction, 69 percent showed 
improvement in at least one of the symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not a cure. And the dogs would need to take Anipryl pills  
daily for the rest of their lives to stifle symptoms. But Dr. Ilana 
Reisner, an Ithaca, N.Y., researcher who helped test the drug, said 
dog owners in the trials described their pooches as dramatically 
improving and enjoying life again. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message we'd like to take to dog owners is when they see  
these behavioral signs, it's really important they take the dog to 
the vet,'' because now they may get treated, said Kanara. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA approved Anipryl last month, but Pfizer salesmen will  
begin telling veterinarians about it next week. It should cost 
about $1.50 to $2.50 a day, depending on the dog's size and dose. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also good news for the thousands of dogs who suffer  
separation anxiety -- their owners leave the house and the dogs get 
so upset that they chew up the sofa and urinate on the rug. It's 
one of the most common reasons dogs are euthanized. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA approved the first treatment, an antidepressant called  
Clomicalm that, when used together with canine therapy, promises to 
improve Fido's behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very difficult syndrome to treat,'' said FDA  
veterinary chief Dr. Stephen Sundlof. ``Oftentimes ... (success) 
can mean the difference between having to put their animal to sleep 
or being able to live with their pet. ... Having tools like this 
available can really make a tremendous difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA approved the sale of Clomicalm, known chemically as  
clomipramine, on Dec. 10, but made the approval public late Monday. 
Manufacturer Novartis Animal Health said the pills will cost dog 
owners about $1 a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Dogs are pack animals, so the stress of being left alone even  
for short periods can prove overwhelming for some. In addition to 
chewing or ripping furniture, they may salivate excessively and 
urinate or defecate inappropriately. 
</P>
<P>
	Separation anxiety accounts for 20 percent to 40 percent of all  
dog visits to vets for behavior problems. Behavior therapy can 
help, but it can be lengthy and complicated as pet owners even have 
to practice leaving home for progressively more minutes each day so 
the dog learns that its ``family'' will come back. 
</P>
<P>
	About 160 dogs were given either Clomicalm or a dummy pill in  
addition to their behavior therapy. After a week, 47 percent of the 
Clomicalm dogs had improved, compared with just 29 percent of the 
dogs getting behavior therapy alone. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of two months, 65 percent of the Clomicalm dogs had  
improved, compared with 55 percent of the placebo dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Both drugs caused mild side effects, including vomiting and  
diarrhea.

<HEADLINE> Experts Unveil New Hacker Technique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Web surfers using a computer with  
Microsoft Excel on it are leaving themselves vulnerable to hackers 
who could steal data off that computer, according to Finjan Inc., a 
San Jose-based computer security company. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe this could affect tens of millions of users as  
they're configured today,'' said Finjan chief executive Bill Lyons. 
``An attacker could steal or copy innocent Internet users' private 
files without their knowledge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Here's how it works: A hacker sets up a Web site with the  
corrupt code programmed into it. Then an unknowing computer user, 
who has Microsoft Corp.'s Excel spreadsheet software installed but 
not necessarily running, visits the site. While the user is at the 
site, the hacker worms into the user's Excel program and, through 
that, is able to pull files off their computer. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes this flaw more devastating is that normally users  
have to take steps such as downloading infected software to be 
attacked; in this case, users could be hit by simply visiting a Web 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	So far it's only theoretical. Neither Finjan nor Microsoft has  
heard of actual attacks. But as John Stewart, a chief architect at 
Digital Island pointed out, it would be simple enough to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``This attack can be executed by almost anyone,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Reporters who went to a designated Finjan World Wide Web site on  
Tuesday experienced the rip-off firsthand. After clicking on 
Finjan's site and agreeing to be hacked, the security company was 
able to pull files out of reporters' computers. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft, John Duncan, a product  
manager in Microsoft's Office group, said they already heard about 
and offered a solution to the problem last month, e-mailing close 
to 1 million customers a security bulletin on Dec. 10 that offered 
a free, downloadable patch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were notified by a third party and we moved to fix it  
immediately,'' he said. More importantly, Duncan said they have had 
no customer complaints about the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``There really is no newness to this,'' he said. ``There's not a  
bug in the software.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Trial Could Halt Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate agonizing over whether to throw  
Bill Clinton out of office, the chief justice presiding over the 
trial, the White House obsessed with defensive tactics: It sounds 
like a formula for gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
	All three branches of the government -- the executive,  
legislative and judicial -- are about to become embroiled in what 
one senator, Republican Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, calls ``the 
most important trial that's ever been conducted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With no certainty about how the impeachment drama plays itself  
out, it is possible that Washington is headed for a standstill, 
everything frozen in place until Clinton's fate is settled. 
</P>
<P>
	That could take days, weeks or months, depending upon the  
forecaster. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., an impeachment opponent, 
said during House committee hearings that a trial could consume 
``perhaps a year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There have been doomsday scenarios. A few days before the House  
impeached Clinton, Paul Begala, a political adviser to the 
president, predicted that such an act would lead to chaos. ``This 
is going to make the government shutdown look like a picnic,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And a Republican congressman who opposed impeachment, Rep. Peter  
King of New York, foresaw bitterness so severe that it would 
eradicate bipartisanship, an essential element to governing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are a nation intent on killing itself, on destroying  
itself,'' King said. ``You won't see any cooperation, none at all. 
There's too much bad blood on the floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, dire predictions are sometimes made for political  
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The case can be made that a Senate trial won't make much  
difference, especially if it ends in acquittal or compromise, and 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, the country has lived for nearly a year with the  
scandal and has prospered. With the Cold War over and the economy 
good, what happens in Washington seems less crucial than it used 
to. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who is dubious of shortcut proposals  
for handling the trial, said ``it's more important that it be done 
right than it be done quickly.'' Some senators say they could 
operate on a two-track system, legislation in the morning, trial in 
the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is still set to deliver his Jan. 19 State of the Union  
address, although a handful of senators proposed a delay. Another 
important deadline requires Clinton to submit a budget by Feb. 1. 
The White House says it can do that. 
</P>
<P>
	The most comparable period is the Watergate era, from the spring  
of 1972 though the summer of 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington was engrossed, but government went on: soldiers  
soldiered, mailmen delivered the mail. Elections were held, meat 
got inspected, Congress raised the minimum wage, and the Supreme 
Court handed down decisions despite a docket heavy with Nixon's 
attempts to defy subpoenas. 
</P>
<P>
	Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, talking to  
schoolchildren last month, said that even if Chief Justice William 
Rehnquist has to preside over a Senate trial in the afternoons, 
he'd be free to hear cases in the mornings. 
</P>
<P>
	Political scientist Stephen Wayne of Georgetown University, an  
expert on both Congress and the presidency, says Clinton and 
congressional Republicans would both be motivated to be productive 
during a trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Clinton would play the role of a public president  
with a vengeance to try to demonstrate the importance of his public 
functions and the triviality of those accusations about his private 
behavior,'' said Wayne. ``We will see a president taking trips, 
going to disaster areas, welcoming children to the White House. 
Whatever presidents do, we will see the president doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Congress, ``if the Republicans want to demonstrate that  
they are not mean-spirited,'' they might enact something like 
Clinton's forthcoming proposal to gave a tax break to those who 
take care of the long-term disabled, Wayne said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate historian Donald Ritchie says preoccupation with the  
president's struggle to stay in office can have the effect of 
giving lower officials a free hand. 
</P>
<P>
	He recalls that in 1974, William Usery Jr., head of the Federal  
Mediation and Conciliation Service, ``saw a golden opportunity for 
bold initiatives.'' Usery took advantage of Nixon's distraction and 
``pushed a very independent-minded and progressive labor policy.'' 
Impressed, Gerald Ford, the new president, made Usery his secretary 
of labor.

<HEADLINE> Gates: I Can't Recall Browser Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates told government  
lawyers he couldn't remember key provisions of a 1997 agreement 
that prevented a leading software company, Intuit, from promoting a 
rival's Internet browser. 
</P>
<P>
	But Intuit Inc.'s chief executive officer, William Harris,  
testified Tuesday at the Microsoft antitrust trial that the 
prohibition against helping Netscape Communications Corp. ``were 
instructions from Mr. Gates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government also introduced e-mail showing a Microsoft  
executive, Brad Chase, reported to Gates in April 1997 that Intuit 
had accepted those provisions, including one to ``not enter into 
marketing-promo agreements with other browser manufacturers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government suggested that Gates, whose videotaped testimony  
was shown in the courtroom, wasn't being truthful when Justice 
Department lawyer David Boies pressed him about the exclusive 
agreement. Intuit makes the popular Quicken personal finance 
software used by roughly 10 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly wasn't something that could have been very  
significant to me, because I don't have a recollection of it,'' 
Gates answered Boies. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also disclosed a February 1997 e-mail from Gates  
to another Microsoft executive, empathizing ``I can say I am more 
scared than you are'' that more software wasn't being written to 
run exclusively on the company's dominant Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	``I agree that making sure applications are primarily on Windows  
is something we have lost site (sic) of,'' Gates wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, in a statement, said the government's use of the  
10-minute video excerpt ``lacks substance and is aimed more at 
personal attacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government contends the Intuit deal is an example of illegal  
exclusionary agreements Microsoft used as part of its campaign to 
``crush'' Netscape's rival Internet browser. 
</P>
<P>
	Intuit agreed to distribute Microsoft's own browser, not  
Netscape's, in exchange for prominent placement of its finance 
services within Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris testified that Intuit initially resisted the restrictions  
against working with Netscape, whose browser at the time was more 
popular. Harris recounted a 1997 meeting with Microsoft executive 
Will Poole when Intuit even offered to pay Microsoft to waive the 
provision. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said at that meeting and in other communications that these  
(provisions) were instructions from Mr. Gates,'' Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a setback for the government, Harris said that Intuit  
``most likely'' would have agreed anyway to distribute Microsoft's 
browser over Netscape's, even without Microsoft's valuable offer to 
bundle Intuit's finance services into Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	The government contends Microsoft used its influence as the  
maker of Windows to intimidate companies into distributing its 
browser over Netscape's. But Microsoft maintains its software won 
those deals on its technical merits, a claim Harris supported. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft later began questioning the government's final  
scheduled witness, economist Franklin Fisher of the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyer Michael Lacovara challenged Fisher's estimates showing  
dramatic increases each month since January 1997 of people choosing 
Microsoft's Internet software over Netscape's. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacovara also noted several previous court cases where Fisher  
had testified unsuccessfully, including one in which a judge 
complained that Fisher had been ``not more than cursorily 
familiar'' with the issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher maintained he had a fair understanding of the technical  
issues in the Microsoft case but added: ``I don't believe intimate 
knowledge of the technology is necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 110 pages of written testimony made public earlier, Fisher  
warned of the ``danger that Microsoft's existing monopoly power 
will be used to monopolize other critical markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If Microsoft is permitted to ... put itself in the position to  
control and ultimately exact a monopoly toll for efficient access 
to the Internet -- the economic costs to consumers and the economy 
will again be substantial,'' Fisher wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft will begin calling its witnesses -- starting with MIT  
economist Richard Schmalansee -- next week.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed mixed Tuesday, with  
share prices tumbling in Tokyo and Taipei, but surging in Bangkok 
and Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average slumped 183.15  
points, or 1.37 percent, to 13,232.74 points. On Monday, the 
average lost 426.28 points, or 3.08 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese share prices plunged as the dollar's weakness against  
the yen sent export-sensitive stocks tumbling. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors sold shares of technology and automobile stocks amid  
fears that a lower dollar could lead to reduced earnings for these 
export-oriented companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 111.52 yen at midafternoon, down 2.34  
yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York 
level of 112.07 yen overnight. The dollar last traded below the 112 
yen level in June of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro was trading at $1.1810 at midafternoon in  
Tokyo, lower than $1.1828 late Monday in New York. The euro was at 
$1.1873 in Tokyo late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Taiwan also tumbled, with the key index ending  
at its lowest point since August 1996 because of a lack confidence 
in the island's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants said no specific news about Taiwan's economy  
emerged on Tuesday to trigger the massive declines. Rather, a 
general pessimism over the economic outlook has set in and shows no 
sign of fading, they added. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taipei market's Weighted Stock Price Index fell 266 points,  
or 4.1 percent, to 6,152.43. 
</P>
<P>
	Thai share prices closed sharply higher, with the key index  
surging 6.1 percent following rumors that Bangkok Bank PCL had 
acquired a 5 percent stake in the fixed-line telephone operator 
TelecomAsia PCL. 
</P>
<P>
	The communications sector index was boosted by the strength in  
TelecomAsia PCL, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stock Exchange of Thailand index rose 21.83 points to  
378.51. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian shares also surged as market sentiment turned  
positive following the unveiling of the country's new budget, 
pushing the index above the 400-point level. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite Index rose 14.695 points,  
or 3.7 percent, to 408.703. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealers said many investors see the new budget as realistic,  
reflecting the Indonesian government's effort to handle the 
country's battered economy. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed sharply higher,  
boosted by a rise in market heavyweight Telecom Corp. of New 
Zealand Ltd. The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 49.98 points, 
or 2.4 percent, to 2,115.26. 
</P>
<P>
	HONG KONG: Share prices closed higher after three consecutive  
sessions of declines. The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 81.89 
points, or 0.8 percent, closing at 9,891.06. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed lower after resource  
stocks extended earlier losses and the industrial sector gave up 
initial gains. The Australia's All Ordinaries Index fell 17.0 
points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,815.6. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine share prices closed higher. The Philippine  
Stock Exchange index of 30 selected companies rose 26.15 points, or 
1.3 percent, to 2,006.85. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mostly lower. The Straits Times  
Index fell 13.87 points, or 1 percent, to 1,386.24. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed higher in active trading. The Korea  
Composite Stock Price Index rose 10.98 points, or 1.8 percent, to 
598.55. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares closed higher. The benchmark  
Composite Index rose 6.24 points, or 1.1 percent, to 567.89.

<HEADLINE> NBA Players To Vote Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With no one saying if it will be a secret ballot  
or a show of hands, locked-out NBA players started arriving in town 
Tuesday to cast votes that could determine if there will be a 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's vote comes on the eve of the possible cancellation  
of the rest of the season. The balloting will be open to all NBA 
players, although the union emphasized that it is not a 
ratification vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, players will be asked whether they support the union  
negotiating committee's recommendation to reject the owners' final 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to put it to the test,'' union president Patrick  
Ewing said, ``but we're going to make sure they stand by their 
negotiating committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner David Stern, meanwhile, said the chances are  
slightly better than 50-50 that there will be a settlement that 
saves the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``On a scale of one to 10, I'd make it a 5-plus,'' he told CNN.  
</P>
<P>
	More than 200 players are expected to vote. A final decision on  
the balloting rules won't come until Wednesday morning, and union 
attorney Jeffrey Kessler said the particulars will not be made 
public. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibilities range from a secret ballot, with players  
privately voting their consciences, to a show of hands in a closed 
room where the peer pressure to vote in support of the committee 
would be overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the players will have any concern about the  
legitimacy of votes, and I don't think anybody will be coerced,'' 
Kessler said. ``Everyone will have a chance to vote their 
conscience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the players vote to support the committee's recommendation,  
the union would then ask the commissioner and the owners to resume 
collective bargaining negotiations and try to hammer out a 
compromise agreement that would save what's left of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	If the players reject the committee's recommendation, the union  
would be expected to put the owners' final offer to an actual 
ratification vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're expecting them to vote in support of the position  
promoted by the negotiating committee,'' union director Billy 
Hunter said. ``We called the vote because everyone suggested we 
call a vote. We want to get it out there and get it over with 
because we think the message that we have to send to the owners is 
that our players are still unified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 400 players are eligible for the vote, which is scheduled  
for the afternoon. Players have been calling publicly for a vote on 
the owners' offer, although Hunter has said 80 to 85 percent of the 
players support the union's position. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds to us more like a bargaining tactic than an example  
of union democracy,'' NBA chief legal counsel Jeffrey Mishkin said. 
</P>
<P>
	One who won't be voting is Rony Seikaly of the New Jersey Nets,  
who feels the players should leave the decision in the hands of the 
negotiating committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the owners' way of stonewalling us has worked,''  
Seikaly said. ``Players are starting to panic. The union is 
somewhat breaking because of all this. I thought we were going to 
be together, but I'm not sure if we are anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The owners' final offer was presented to the union by Stern in  
Denver 1 1/2 weeks ago. Stern has been pushing for a player vote ever 
since, and the union finally agreed to one after the owners' 
negotiating committee voted 9-0 Monday to reject the union's final 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	That gave the union only 36 hours to set up a full membership  
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who's going to fly to New York on two days' notice after a  
blizzard?'' Keith Askins of the Miami Heat told the Fort Lauderdale 
Sun-Sentinel. ``This isn't a vote. This is out of control. A vote 
is when you go to the federal building and cast your ballot. This 
is wrong. I feel ashamed to be part of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some players seemed to think they were coming to New York for an  
actual ratification vote, and all of them were aware that the 
season might not be salvaged. 
</P>
<P>
	``We trust those guys; they've done a good job,'' said Avery  
Johnson of the San Antonio Spurs. ``But there comes a time when you 
have to make yourself heard, whether by voice or by ink. The 
question is whether or not we can live with a deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides will have their full negotiating committees in town  
by Wednesday night, and the league's Board of Governors has 
scheduled a meeting for 11 a.m. Thursday. Stern and deputy 
commissioner Russ Granik have said they will recommend canceling 
the rest of the season if no deal has been reached. 
</P>
<P>
	If an agreement somehow is finalized, a season of 45 to 50 games  
would begin sometime around the first week of February. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least now we'll know what every single player in the league  
is thinking,'' said Chris Antsey of the Dallas Mavericks. ``I guess 
then hopefully we'll get a season underway by means of a vote. If 
not, that means the majority of the players don't want to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It just doesn't make any sense why we're not playing,''  
Mavericks guard Hubert Davis said. ``I've talked to a lot of NBA 
guys, and a lot of guys said they'll take (the offer). Hopefully 
everyone will wake up and see how lucky we are and get back on the 
court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lockout, in effect since July 1, has caused the NBA to miss  
games because of a labor dispute for the first time in its history. 
So far, the first three months of the season have been scrapped and 
players have lost about $500 million in salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Board of Governors votes to cancel the rest of the  
season, the NBA will become the first major professional sports 
league to lose an entire season to a labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't blame the fans if they didn't come back,'' said  
Jeff Hornacek of the Utah Jazz, who does not plan to vote and is in 
favor of accepting the owners' final offer. ``Neither side is 
coming out of this thing looking good.''

<HEADLINE>  Gov. Ventura Setting Into New Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- His post-election honeymoon over, Jesse  
Ventura has settled in for the transition from unlikely political 
star to head of state. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Body'' is now the governor.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to be up here,'' Ventura said at the end of the day  
Monday, finally in his first-floor office after working out of the 
Capitol basement since the election two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura was back at work today, holding a reception for  
lawmakers at the governor's mansion. True to his promise that he 
would stay connected with the public, he planned to meet this 
afternoon with students at the University of Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometime this week, he hoped to begin work in earnest on the  
state's two-year, $23 billion budget, one of the most important 
tasks for any new governor. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's first Reform Party governor took the oath of office  
shortly before noon Monday. He then delivered an unscripted, 
11-minute speech that included thank-yous and ideals, but avoided 
tax relief, the central theme of his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we move forward to do Minnesota's business and we will do  
it to the best of our ability,'' Ventura said to about 800 people 
watching in the Capitol rotunda. He then added: ``Hooyah!'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 40 Ventura critics joined the throngs at the Capitol. The  
Taxpayers League of Minnesota held a rally on the Capitol steps to 
press for return of a $1.5 billion projected budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Taxpayers League and others are here to remind the  
governor of the promises he made during the campaign to return 
$1,000 to taxpayers,'' said David Strom, the organization's 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura has said he plans to push for return of about $1 billion  
of the surplus, but wants to use at least some of the remainder for 
health initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief executives also were sworn in Monday in other states,  
including California, Idaho, Nevada, Wisconsin, Wyoming and 
Arizona, where Gov. Jane Hull and four other women made the state 
the first with an all-female elected line of succession. 
</P>
<P>
	But none of the others generated as much attention or amazement  
as the 47-year-old Ventura, who got 37 percent of the vote in 
November, good enough to stun two political veterans, Republican 
Norm Coleman and Democrat Hubert Humphrey III. 
</P>
<P>
	The former professional wrestler who once went by the nickname  
``The Body'' before turning to acting and finally to politics did 
it largely by capturing the votes of the disenchanted and young, 
traditionally disengaged voters. 
</P>
<P>
	For them, Ventura said Monday, ``We must put down the partisan  
party politics and look at the bigger picture. ... We cannot fail. 
We must not fail because if we do, we can lose this generation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wore a gold SEAL trident in his lapel at the ceremony and  
spoke of his four years of Navy in the early 1970s as the formative 
time of his life. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura acknowledged that there are those who wonder, ``Is Jesse  
Ventura up to governing? Can he do the job?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I can always look back to my Navy SEAL training when the going  
gets tough and know that it's not as tough as that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After he was sworn in, Ventura hugged his wife, Terry, and their  
two children Jade, 15, and Tyrel, 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura was host of an invitation-only reception at the  
governor's mansion. He decided to forgo a black-tie ball in favor 
of a ``people's celebration'' bash at the Target Center Jan. 16 
with live music.

<HEADLINE> CBS Replacing ABC on AOL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS is replacing ABC as the exclusive broadcast  
news provider to America Online, a big leap for CBS as it tries to 
catch rival news organizations with more popular Internet sites. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS News will provide text, audio and video to America Online,  
the world's largest online service, as well as its CompuServe 
affiliate. Anchors and guests from programs such as ``CBS Evening 
News,'' ``60 Minutes'' and ``48 Hours'' also will be featured on 
live AOL chat sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies would not disclose financial details in announcing  
the deal Tuesday, and said only that it is a multiyear pact. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS' Web site has so far trailed those run by its main news  
rivals, NBC, CNN and ABC. It will now gain significant new exposure 
as the only broadcaster on AOL, which has 15 million members 
worldwide. CompuServe adds an additional 2 million members. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the vast amount of traffic AOL gets, this definitely  
puts (CBS) on the map,'' said Mark Mooradian, a senior analyst at 
Internet research firm Jupiter Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL will continue to offer news from a variety of other media,  
such as The New York Times, Newsweek and Business Week magazines 
and wire services including The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors welcomed the news, pushing CBS Corp.'s stock up 81 1/4  
cents, or nearly 3 percent, to $32.68 3/4 in late afternoon trading on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, CBS will also be the only broadcast news provider on  
the AOL.com Web site, which is available to anyone on the Internet, 
not just AOL members. But AOL said it could strike deals in the 
future with other broadcasters for that site. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC had been the exclusive broadcast news provider to AOL since  
1997. Michelle Bergman, a spokeswoman for ABCNews.com, would not 
comment directly on whether it tried to renegotiate with AOL. But 
she stressed that ABCNews.com has grown quickly since it was 
launched in May 1997 and has already established its own strong 
Internet presence. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported Tuesday that an executive involved  
in the AOL-CBS negotiations said AOL was concerned about the 
competitive Internet investments being made by ABC's parent, Walt 
Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bob Pittman, AOL's president, said the deal does not reflect  
dissatisfaction with ABC. He said CBS and AOL already worked 
together this past fall on a promotional campaign for the network's 
prime-time lineup and wanted to further develop their relationship.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Iraqi Planes in Dogfight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Four U.S. fighter jets fired missiles at Iraqi  
planes today in the ``no-fly'' zone over southern Iraq, a senior 
U.S. administration official said. It was the first American-Iraqi 
air-to-air confrontation in more than six years. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. missiles apparently failed to hit the Iraqi planes,  
although one Iraqi plane was believed to have crashed, apparently 
after running out of fuel, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The American planes -- two Air Force F-15 strike aircraft and two  
Navy F-14 fighters -- returned safely after the confrontation, the 
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The Navy planes 
were from the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident, which happened at about 2:30 a.m. EST, marked an  
escalation of tensions between Iraq and the United States and 
Britain over enforcing the ``no-fly'' zones in northern and 
southern Iraq. Iraq considers the restrictions illegal and has 
vowed to defy them. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has said U.S. and British forces will continue  
banning Iraqi flights in the restricted zones, arguing that Saddam 
Hussein's military still represents a threat to minority Kurds in 
the north and Shiite Muslims in the south. 
</P>
<P>
	David Leavy, spokesman for the White House National Security  
Council, said today, ``The president has made it clear we will 
enforce the no-fly zones vigorously. The Iraqi violations are at 
their own peril.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A senior Pentagon official, who also confirmed the incident,  
said the air-to-air altercation was the first in Iraq since Dec. 
27, 1992, when a U.S. F-16 shot down an Iraqi MiG-25. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon official said he could not identify the number or  
type of Iraqi aircraft involved in today's incident, but that the 
Iraqis have MiGs and F-1s in their current inventory. 
</P>
<P>
	One senior military officer, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said there apparently were at least six Iraqi planes flying in the 
``no-fly'' zone at the time of the incident. The officer said the 
F-15 jets fired a total of four air-to-air missiles and the F-14s 
fired two. He said there was no indication the Iraqi planes fired 
any missiles at the U.S. planes. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said it is not clear exactly what brought down one  
of the Iraqi planes, but that a lack of fuel was suspected ``since 
they don't give those guys enough fuel to defect'' to another 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to today, there had been two incidents in the no-fly zones  
-- neither involving air-to-air combat -- since the U.S. and British 
airstrikes of Dec. 16-19. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 28, U.S. warplanes fired on an Iraqi surface-to-air  
missile battery in the northern zone after being fired on from the 
ground. Iraq said four Iraqi soldiers were killed and seven 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 30, U.S. warplanes hit an anti-aircraft battery in the  
south. Iraq says a farmer was killed and two other civilians 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Saddam announced earlier in a statement read on state-run Iraq  
television that the no-fly zones imposed on his country have no 
basis in international law and vowed that Iraq will fight 
violations of its airspace ``with all its courage and bravery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, the State Department said one of Saddam's sons  
directed the murder of hundreds of Iraqi dissidents last November 
in the Shiite region of southern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman James P. Rubin said Monday that tensions in the south,  
a stronghold of anti-Saddam sentiment, rose after the 
assassinations of two senior Islamic clerics this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	He said there have been reports of mass arrests throughout the  
southern region and in the Shiite areas outside Baghdad over the 
past six weeks -- in addition to hundreds of summary executions of 
dissidents at two prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	``The repression reportedly reached a peak in November, with  
hundreds killed in actions directed personally by Qusai Hussein,'' 
Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regime military action against the Shiites is an intrinsic and  
continuing part of this campaign of repression. Since 1991 the 
regime has been carrying out the widespread and brutal repression 
of the Shiite population of southern Iraq.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said opposition sources from the Shiite areas reported  
that seven villages were recently destroyed or turned into military 
outposts. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that more than 2,000 civilians who were unable to flee  
were reportedly taken hostage by regime forces and possibly sent to 
Baghdad. They were made up largely of the old, the infirm, women 
and children, he said.

<HEADLINE> 6 Octuplets Breathing on Their Own </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- In the dim light of the neonatal intensive care  
unit at Texas Children's Hospital, Gorom Louis' hushed world is one 
of whispering nurses and the beep of a nearby monitor. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiny Gorom, the last of the Houston octuplets born last month,  
lies with her eyes squeezed tightly shut and takes delicate sips 
through a tube taped to her mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Beanie Baby puppies stand guard in her electronically warmed  
Plexiglas bassinet. One of her paper clip-sized feet stabs 
reflexively at the soft fabric pad that surrounds her. 
</P>
<P>
	Still recovering from abdominal surgery, Gorom, who now weighs  
just over a pound, is the last of the seven surviving babies to 
need the assistance of a ventilator. 
</P>
<P>
	Her two brothers and four sisters -- all dressed alike in  
pastel-knitted caps and diapers the size of thank-you notes -- have 
graduated to oxygen piped into their tiny noses. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorom's brother Jioke ranks as the biggest -- just under 2  
pounds. Monday's weigh-in showed that all the babies are either 
holding their own or are starting to gain weight, a very positive 
beginning, doctors say. 
</P>
<P>
	If everything continues to go well, Gorom should soon be taken  
off the ventilator and the seven siblings could go home as early as 
March, said Dr. Leonard Weisman told The Associated Press during a 
tour of the unit. 
</P>
<P>
	For the next few months, however, all seven will remain within  
the 120-bed Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, the nation's largest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have a way to go,'' said Weisman, checking the  
monitors over Gorom's warming bed. 
</P>
<P>
	The babies' mother, Nkem Chukwu, 27, delivered her first child,  
Ebuka, on Dec. 8 and her seven siblings on Dec. 20. The tiniest, 
Odera, died of heart and lung failure Dec. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	The neonatal unit is more nursery than sterile laboratory, with  
nurses buzzing around to make sure babies are receiving enough 
``skin'' time -- crucial contact with parents and volunteers who 
cuddle them. 
</P>
<P>
	A pair of Christmas trees stand a few feet from the pods that  
contain groups of four to six premature or critically ill babies. 
Newborn warming beds are decorated with cheery name tags and 
volunteers donate handmade blankets and, for the tiniest charges, 
canopies to cover their incubators so they can sleep better. 
</P>
<P>
	Nutrition specialists are also on hand to map out individual  
growth plans and a neonatologist, a doctor who specializes in the 
health of newborns, is on call steps away from the nursery 24 hours 
a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Mothers use electronic key cards to access soothing private  
rooms for breast feeding. The unit is also one of the first to use 
nitric oxide to treat pulmonary high blood pressure in infants. 
</P>
<P>
	``The high tech stuff is to keep them alive,'' said Weisman.  
``But the thing that makes the difference is nutrition and 
development. That's really what this is all about.''

<HEADLINE> Vols Defense Rises to the Occasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Tennessee can play a little D, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Florida State came into Monday night's Fiesta Bowl with the  
top-ranked defense in the country. The Seminoles were as good as 
advertised, but weren't the only good defense on the field at Sun 
Devil Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got a lot of motivation from that,'' said linebacker Al  
Wilson, who led the Vols with nine tackles. ``All year we've been a 
good defense. You can't take anything away from Florida State, they 
are a great defense, but we wanted to show we had a good defense, 
too. I think we did that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a result the national championship trophy is headed to  
Knoxville, Tenn., with the Volunteers (13-0), not to Tallahassee, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tennessee offense managed two long pass plays in a 23-16  
victory, while Florida State didn't really have any big plays. The 
Seminoles' longest play of the game was 39 yards late in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what we said all week, if we could eliminate the big  
plays we'd have a chance to win,'' defensive coordinator John 
Chavis said. ``The kids made it happen. They just did a great 
job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vols held Florida State to 253 yards, forced three  
turnovers, and added a touchdown of its own on defensive back 
Dwayne Goodrich's 54-yard interception return. 
</P>
<P>
	``An interception for a touchdown in the national championship  
game,'' Goodrich said. ``That's like every DB's dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee held the Seminoles to 16 points despite being put into  
bad positions several times by offensive miscues or special teams 
plays by the Seminoles. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida's State's big-play receiver, Peter Warrick, had just one  
catch for 7 yards. His Tennessee counterpart, Peerless Price, had 
catches of 76 yards to set up one touchdown and another of 79 yards 
for the TD that sealed the Volunteers' first national title since 
1951. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vols harassed Florida State quarterback Marcus Outzen,  
making just his third start, into a 9-of-22 night for 145 yards, 
and dropped him for 54 yards in losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee felt its defense could hold its own if the offense  
didn't turn the ball over and special teams didn't give the 
Seminoles great field position. 
</P>
<P>
	Both fears came true in the first half.  
</P>
<P>
	Seminoles safety Derrick Gibson intercepted Tee Martin's pass  
and returned it 43 yards to the Volunteers 3, setting up Florida 
State's first touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the time the Vols staved off trouble.  
</P>
<P>
	It was 7-0 when Outzen tried to hit Warrick in the right flat.  
Goodrich picked it off and went 54 yards untouched for the score. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State again struck in the kicking game for the final  
points of the half. Warrick returned a punt 51 yards to the 
Tennessee 27, where he was stopped on a touchdown-saving tackle by 
punter David Leaverton. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles managed a first-and-goal at the Vols 5, but two  
penalties and a sack forced Florida State to settle for Sebastian 
Janikowski's 35-yard field goal to make it 14-9 at the break. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles, however, wouldn't score again until just 3:42  
remained and the Vols solidly ahead 23-9.

<HEADLINE> Employee Health Costs Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK -- Throughout the 1990s, companies seeking to control  
rising health costs had an easy solution: Sign their workers up to 
an HMO. 
</P>
<P>
	But things won't be as easy in 1999.  
</P>
<P>
	That because average premium increases for health maintenance  
organizations are rising 8 percent this year, the same rate as 
traditional insurance that has fewer cost controls, according to 
the findings of a national survey being released Wednesday by 
consulting firm Towers Perrin. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, large-employers' health benefit costs are increasing an  
average of 7 percent this year, almost twice the rate of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	While still a far cry from the 14 percent to 18 percent  
increases in the beginning of the decade, the acceleration in costs 
marks the biggest jump since 1993, the year President Clinton made 
his ill-fated national health reform proposal 
</P>
<P>
	``Our findings suggest the easy savings offered by managed care  
may already be behind us,'' said William J. Falk, a principal in 
Towers Perrin's Chicago office. 
</P>
<P>
	HMOs have increased premiums lately to rebuild profits. They've  
cited rising prescription drug prices and the decline in federal 
fees from the Medicare insurance program for the elderly to justify 
the rate hikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of plans, in fact, quit offering health insurance to  
Medicare enrollees this month because they did not believe they 
could profit with the government's reimbursement rate. 
</P>
<P>
	That's creating headaches for those employers that offer health  
benefits to retirees. Some had shifted retirees into HMOs from 
Medicare supplement policies to take advantage of the low or no 
premiums for Medicare HMO coverage in the large retiree markets of 
South Florida and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	While fewer employers provide health insurance coverage to  
retirees, about one-third still offer the benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	Though traditional health insurance and HMO premiums are now  
rising at the same rate, HMOs still are generally 20 percent 
cheaper. And HMOs offer more benefits, including coverage for 
prescription drugs and few, if any, deductibles. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Falk said he expects most employers will stick with  
HMOs and other forms of managed care. ``It still is an attractive 
alternative,'' he said 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 207 employers, primarily large Fortune 100 companies,  
took part in the Towers Perrin survey, which was conducted by mail 
in November. 
</P>
<P>
	A study released this week by Buck Consultants found corporate  
health-benefit costs increasing by 5.6 percent for HMOs, 12.6 
percent for traditional insurance coverage and 9.8 percent for 
preferred-provider plans, a type of managed health care that is 
less restrictive than HMOs. Buck, a New York consulting firm, 
surveyed 25 health insurers.

<HEADLINE>  Gov. Ventura Setting Into New Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- His post-election honeymoon over, Jesse  
Ventura has settled in for the transition from unlikely political 
star to head of state. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Body'' is now the governor.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to be up here,'' Ventura said at the end of the day  
Monday, finally in his first-floor office after working out of the 
Capitol basement since the election two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura was back at work today, holding a reception for  
lawmakers at the governor's mansion. True to his promise that he 
would stay connected with the public, he planned to meet this 
afternoon with students at the University of Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometime this week, he hoped to begin work in earnest on the  
state's two-year, $23 billion budget, one of the most important 
tasks for any new governor. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's first Reform Party governor took the oath of office  
shortly before noon Monday. He then delivered an unscripted, 
11-minute speech that included thank-yous and ideals, but avoided 
tax relief, the central theme of his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we move forward to do Minnesota's business and we will do  
it to the best of our ability,'' Ventura said to about 800 people 
watching in the Capitol rotunda. He then added: ``Hooyah!'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 40 Ventura critics joined the throngs at the Capitol. The  
Taxpayers League of Minnesota held a rally on the Capitol steps to 
press for return of a $1.5 billion projected budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Taxpayers League and others are here to remind the  
governor of the promises he made during the campaign to return 
$1,000 to taxpayers,'' said David Strom, the organization's 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura has said he plans to push for return of about $1 billion  
of the surplus, but wants to use at least some of the remainder for 
health initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief executives also were sworn in Monday in other states,  
including California, Idaho, Nevada, Wisconsin, Wyoming and 
Arizona, where Gov. Jane Hull and four other women made the state 
the first with an all-female elected line of succession. 
</P>
<P>
	But none of the others generated as much attention or amazement  
as the 47-year-old Ventura, who got 37 percent of the vote in 
November, good enough to stun two political veterans, Republican 
Norm Coleman and Democrat Hubert Humphrey III. 
</P>
<P>
	The former professional wrestler who once went by the nickname  
``The Body'' before turning to acting and finally to politics did 
it largely by capturing the votes of the disenchanted and young, 
traditionally disengaged voters. 
</P>
<P>
	For them, Ventura said Monday, ``We must put down the partisan  
party politics and look at the bigger picture. ... We cannot fail. 
We must not fail because if we do, we can lose this generation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wore a gold SEAL trident in his lapel at the ceremony and  
spoke of his four years of Navy in the early 1970s as the formative 
time of his life. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura acknowledged that there are those who wonder, ``Is Jesse  
Ventura up to governing? Can he do the job?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I can always look back to my Navy SEAL training when the going  
gets tough and know that it's not as tough as that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After he was sworn in, Ventura hugged his wife, Terry, and their  
two children Jade, 15, and Tyrel, 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura was host of an invitation-only reception at the  
governor's mansion. He decided to forgo a black-tie ball in favor 
of a ``people's celebration'' bash at the Target Center Jan. 16 
with live music.

<HEADLINE> Parents Charged in Fire Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A couple who neighbors said frequently left  
their 2-year-old and 9-month-old girls alone while they sipped 
coffee at a local bakery and did errands in the neighborhood were 
charged with child endangerment after the girls died in an 
apartment fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Anna D'Almeida, 21, and Antonio Andrade, 27, told police they  
left the children for a few minutes to buy milk on Monday night, 
but Police Director Joseph Santiago said he doubts their story and 
was considering more serious charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The grocery store the couple said they went to was closed at the  
time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And neighbors said that the couple frequently left their  
children, Ruth Andrade, 2, and 9-month-old Millaya Andrade, alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was always leaving the kids by themselves,'' neighbor  
Laurinda Albes said Tuesday. ``She was famous for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A space heater in the apartment next door accidentally tipped  
over, officials said, sparking the killer blaze in the wooden, 
century-old building. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple was to be arraigned Wednesday on two counts of each  
of child endangerment. They could face 20 to 40 years in prison if 
convicted.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein, Clinton Discuss Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Mideast diplomacy in low gear, King  
Hussein of Jordan called on President Clinton at the White House 
today on his way home from six months of cancer treatment at the 
Mayo Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq was one of the topics they discussed in a half-hour  
session. Clinton told the king he considers Iraq a threat to 
regional stability, David Leavy, a White House spokesman, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, with U.N. approval, barters some food and manufactured  
goods to Iraq for oil the Jordanian economy needs. But the 
Hashemite kingdom has felt the impact of a worldwide trade embargo 
on Iraq, its larger and more powerful neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	Other goods are smuggled overland to Iraq, possibly with the  
tacit approval of the governments of neighboring countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, mindful of Jordan's problems and  
appreciative of the king's support for U.S. diplomacy in the 
Arab-Israeli dispute, plans to boost economic assistance to the 
kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussein then went to the State Department to continue the talks  
with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his illness, the king played a supporting role to  
Clinton at the talks in Maryland in October that produced a West 
Bank agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	At peace with Israel, the king has tried to persuade both sides  
to come to terms on an overall settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussein has been at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., since  
mid-July. He plans to go to London when he leaves Washington, and 
then home to Jordan in mid-January. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, with the Wye accord on hold, Albright has decided  
against a trip to Israel and is sending senior adviser Dennis B. 
Ross in her place. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross is due to meet in New York this week with Israeli Foreign  
Minister Ariel Sharon and will then fly to Israel to speak to and 
attend a meeting in Tel Aviv next week of the governing board of 
the Peres Center for Peace. 
</P>
<P>
	The center seeks to further the goals of Shimon Peres, the  
former Labor prime minister, who pursued a course of conciliatory 
peacemaking with the Palestinians and with Syria. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, on Monday  
dismissed a report in the Israeli media that Albright had refused 
to meet with Sharon. Rubin also said Ross had agreed to speak at 
the Peres center before Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was 
forced to hold elections. They are scheduled for May 17. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not our role to interfere in an election campaign,''  
Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon will meet in New York on Thursday and Friday with Israeli  
consuls general. He also is expected to spend a few hours in 
Washington. Ross will see him on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said the Israeli government had asked for a meeting with  
Albright or Ross, expressing no preference. 
</P>
<P>
	``The suggestion that there's some problem between us and the  
Israeli foreign ministry is simply incorrect,'' the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton went to Israel, the West Bank and Gaza last month to try  
to break the stalemate in implementing the Wye accords. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would send Albright back in January. But Rubin said  
the focus of such a trip would have been to promote the start of 
negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians on an overall 
settlement, which has now been delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the Wye accords have been shelved, with Israel  
insisting that Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority first collect 
illegal weapons, reduce its police force, curb incitements to 
violence and renounce intentions to establish a Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinians, with support from the Clinton administration,  
have rejected the demands as new conditions that were not part of 
the agreement reached at the Wye River Conference Center in rural 
Maryland.

<HEADLINE> Kellogg Announces New CEO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) -- The president and chief operating  
officer of Kellogg Co., Carlos M. Gutierrez, has been elected as 
the huge cereal company's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	He will take over as CEO from Arnold G. Langbo, who stays on as  
chairman until his planned retirement in April 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Gutierrez, 45, will retain his titles of president and chief  
operating officer, a company statement said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement comes as Kellogg tries to revive itself in a  
soft cereal market. It cut 525 salaried jobs and 240 contracted 
positions in November. It hiked domestic cereal prices by an 
average of nearly 3 percent last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The change in CEO is effective April 23, the date of the  
company's annual stockholder meeting. The company's board also 
elected Gutierrez to the board. 
</P>
<P>
	``The enactment of our transition at this time reflects the  
board's confidence that Carlos Gutierrez is prepared to lead 
Kellogg Co. in our commitment to delivering superior shareholder 
value,'' Langbo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Langbo, who is 61, has been with Kellogg since 1956.  
</P>
<P>
	Gutierrez, born in Havana in 1953, started his Kellogg career in  
1975 as a sales representative in Mexico.

                           *Iron Eyes Cody    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Iron Eyes Cody, whose acting credits date to  
the silent movie era and include dozens of films, but whose most 
enduring role was that of the ``Crying Indian'' in the Keep America 
Beautiful ads, died Monday. He was in his 80s or 90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Cody was best known for the 1970s anti-pollution ads that showed  
him mourning -- and shedding a single tear -- at the sight of a 
pristine landscape fouled by litter. 
</P>
<P>
	Cody filmed three more public service announcements and spent  
the next 25 years making public appearances and visits to schools 
on behalf of the movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Cody was born in Oklahoma, but the exact date of birth wasn't  
known. Reference books give various dates, from 1904 to 1915. Based 
on his credits, his most likely date of birth was 1907. 
</P>
<P>
	Cody followed his Cherokee Indian father, Thomas Long Plume, as  
a performer in circuses and Wild West shows and made his first film 
appearance as an extra in the 1919 silent ``Back to God's 
Country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cody went on to appear in more than 80 films in American Indian  
roles; often his character was listed as simply ``Indian,'' 
``Indian Chief'' or ``Indian Joe.'' In one film, ``Perils of 
Nyoka'' in 1942, he had an uncredited role as ``Arab.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His credits included ``Sitting Bull'' in 1954, ``The Great Sioux  
Massacre'' in 1965, ``Nevada Smith'' in 1966, ``A Man Called 
Horse'' in 1970 and ``Ernest Goes to Camp'' in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Cody also served as a technical adviser on Indian matters in  
films. In television, he had guest appearances on ``Bonanza,'' 
``Gunsmoke'' and ``Rawhide.'' 

</P>
<P>
                           *Mario Gozzini    	
</P>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Mario Gozzini, the father of Italian prison reform,  
died Saturday, the ANSA news agency reported. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Gozzini was the author of a 1986 prison reform bill. Under his  
reforms, prisoners are allowed a partial freedom, including long 
furloughs. While many praise the measure as humane, critics have 
noted that several high-profile inmates, including some accused of 
terrorism, have used the furloughs to escape. 
</P>
<P>
	Gozzini entered politics later in life, winning election to the  
Senate as an independent in 1976. He retired in 1987. 

</P>
<P>
                         *Sebastian Haffner    	
</P>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Sebastian Haffner, a best-selling author on  
Prussian-German history and former columnist for German and British 
newspapers, died Saturday. He was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Haffner started a journalism career while studying law, writing  
for Berlin newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1938, during the Nazi era, he left Germany for London with  
his Jewish bride. There he wrote ``Germany: Jekyll and Hyde,'' 
which he called his ``first really political book,'' an attempt to 
explain Germany to the British. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Raimund Pretzel, he adopted the pseudonym Sebastian Haffner  
after he began to write for the London Sunday newspaper The 
Observer. He wanted to shield his family in Germany from 
retribution by the Nazis for his writing. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to Berlin in 1954 as a correspondent for The  
Observer, and began to write often controversial commentaries for 
German newspapers and magazines, including Die Welt and Stern. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his books were a well-received biography of Winston  
Churchill in 1967 and the critical essay ``Comments to Hitler,'' a 
German bestseller in 1978. His last book was ``From Bismarck to 
Hitler'' in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Haffner is survived by his wife, a daughter and a son.  

</P>
<P>
                          *Yaeko Nakamura    	
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Yaeko Nakamura, a woman adored as Japan's ``Mother  
Teresa'' for her dedication to orphans and the elderly, died 
Saturday. She was 93. 
</P>
<P>
	Nakamura, joined by her husband Haruka, began her activities for  
the disadvantaged in 1931 by caring for the children of fishermen 
and others making their living on the waterfront near Osaka. 
</P>
<P>
	After their headquarters was destroyed during U.S. bombing raids  
in World War II, the Nakamuras moved to a northeastern suburb of 
the city and established several new facilities for war orphans, 
the homeless and children whose parents had been killed in traffic 
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	To date, about 3,000 children have received care at welfare  
homes operated by the Nakamuras, according to Masaharu Hojo, the 
head of one of the facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese government awarded Yaeko Nakamura the Order of the  
Sacred Treasure in 1969 for her contributions to society.

<HEADLINE> Mom of Suspect in Gay Slaying Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- The death of a woman whose son is charged  
in the fatal beating of a gay college student is being investigated 
as a possible murder, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of Cindy Thompson Dixon, 40, of Laramie was found  
Sunday on a road about five miles north of the city, Albany County 
Coroner Julie Heggie said. Preliminary autopsy results revealed she 
died of hypothermia. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman's death appeared suspicious and investigators were  
treating the case as a homicide, sheriff's Lt. Bob Volen told the 
Denver Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Dixon was the mother of Russell Henderson, one of two suspects  
awaiting trial in the Oct. 7 beating of University of Wyoming 
student Matthew Shepard, 21, who died five days later. 
Investigators have said the victim may have been targeted because 
he was gay. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Henderson and  
Aaron McKinney, both 21. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate case, Ms. Dixon's husband, Charles E. Dixon, was  
scheduled to make a court appearance today on a charge of battery 
on a household member. No details on his case were available late 
Monday.

<HEADLINE> NBA Ref Says He Doesn't Owe Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A Philadelphia-based NBA referee charged  
with tax evasion said he didn't report more than $84,000 in income 
over three years because the money was value earned from 
frequent-flyer miles, which are not taxed. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutors Tuesday said referee Steve Javie engaged in a  
``pattern of deceit and misrepresentation'' to avoid paying taxes 
on the fringe benefits income. 
</P>
<P>
	In part, that included buying two airline tickets for every  
trip, using the cheaper ticket to fly while using the higher-priced 
ticket, which was voided, for reimbursement and tax records, 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Jud Aaron said. 
</P>
<P>
	Javie, the second referee to go to trial for involvement in the  
airline-ticket scam, is charged with failing to pay about $24,000 
in taxes from 1991 to 1993 and obstructing tax law by giving false 
income information to the NBA and his accountant. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine referees were accused of downgrading first-class airline  
tickets purchased by the league for cheaper seats, pocketing the 
difference and not paying taxes on the unreported income. The 
referees' contract entitles them to first-class tickets, or their 
financial equivalent, for any flight of more than two hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a perfectly legitimate and acceptable way for the  
referees to make extra money,'' Aaron said, adding that it was 
legal as long as taxes were paid on the income. 
</P>
<P>
	But defense attorney Greg Magarity said Javie used  
frequent-flyer miles to upgrade the cheaper ticket into a 
first-class ticket. Therefore, Magarity said the travel 
reimbursement money was the payment for the frequent-flyer miles; 
the IRS claims that same money was unreported income. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about the IRS' absolute blind spot in their ability to  
collect ... taxes on the use of personal frequent-flyer miles,'' 
Magarity said. ``He's charged criminally for the use of his 
frequent-flyer miles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of the other referees have pleaded guilty and most have been  
sentenced to some combination of probation, home confinement, 
community service and fines. One other case went to trial this 
summer, but referee Jess Kersey pleaded guilty several days into 
the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia is expected to  
last more than a week. Among expected witnesses for the prosecution 
and defense are IRS agents, NBA representatives and people who have 
used frequent-flyer miles without paying taxes on their value.

<HEADLINE> Black Farmers Get $375M Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, Ga. (AP) -- As many as 3,000 black farmers across the  
country who say they were unfairly denied government loans and 
subsidies will share $375 million under a settlement worked out 
Tuesday with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, which would end a racial discrimination lawsuit  
filed in 1997, the farmers would get tax-free payments of $50,000 
each, and their government debts would be forgiven. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are here to announce a historic agreement for both the USDA  
and -- I believe -- for our country,'' Agriculture Secretary Dan 
Glickman said in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge in Washington gave preliminary approval to the  
deal Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton issued a statement calling the settlement an  
important step in ``ongoing efforts to rid the Agriculture 
Department of discriminatory behavior and redress any harm that has 
been caused by past discrimination against African-American family 
farmers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the farmers who would benefit is Willie Head, who grows  
tobacco and vegetables on his 150-acre farm about 200 miles south 
of Atlanta. In 1992, he complained that the government had 
discriminated by denying him loans. 
</P>
<P>
	He plans to use his share of the settlement to pay off a $42,000  
lien on his land and buy seed and supplies, but that means the 
money will be gone by the time he plants his 1999 crops. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am happy to see this come to a conclusion, but I am not  
happy about the way it concluded,'' Head said. ``It's not going to 
solve our problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Head said his situation is typical among black farmers, many of  
whom have been ``farming with the tips of our fingernails.'' The 
average debt for farmers involved in the lawsuit is $75,000 to 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed by 1,000 farmers. As many as 2,000 other  
farmers are expected to join in the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The case, which was supposed to go to trial Feb. 1, covers  
claims from 1983 -- the year the Reagan administration disbanded the 
department's office of civil rights -- to 1997, the year after the 
office was restored. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would be significantly higher than the  
$15,000-per-farmer offer the agency made this summer. But it still 
is far less than the $3 billion farmers initially sought. 
</P>
<P>
	A fairness hearing is set for early March where the deal is  
expected to get final approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Some plaintiffs, hoping for a larger settlement, wanted the case  
to go to trial but didn't press the issue because they feared the 
Agriculture Department would appeal and delay the case for years. 
</P>
<P>
	As it is, many young, rural blacks have given up on farming,  
said Head, a third-generation farmer who has a business degree. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has devastated me in my career and also the younger  
generation like my son,'' he said. ``He does not want to farm now, 
so it means there won't be anyone to carry on the legacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Harris, 53, a plaintiff from Leesburg, 10 miles north of  
Albany, said one of his five sons was interested in farming until 
Harris tried to get a loan after filing for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's disillusioned,'' Harris said. ``Now he's having doubts.  
The others don't seem to want to be on the farm on account of what 
I go through, and I don't blame them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris had to leave much of his cotton crop in the field last  
winter because of excessive rain that made it too wet to pick. He 
was able to plant his 1998 cotton and soybean crops only because 
his neighbors, who own most of the land he farms, let him postpone 
his rent payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, who has been farming for 16 years, said white farmers  
always seem to be able to get government help when they have 
similar troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	``White farmers who started when I did are well off. They've  
done well,'' he said. ``They went through the same steps as me and 
a lot of them wondered why I wasn't progressing. I know how to 
farm. Every time a tractor rolls, I'm on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most plaintiffs are expected to take the $50,000 payment option,  
but those who have well-documented cases of discrimination could 
have their cases settled by an arbitrator. 
</P>
<P>
	Others were close to reaching independent settlements with the  
Agriculture Department and could opt out of the class-action 
settlement.

<HEADLINE> Ryan, Brett, Yount Await Hall Call </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nolan Ryan and George Brett are surely headed to  
the Hall of Fame. Now, who will join them? 
</P>
<P>
	Robin Yount also was hoping to get the call from Cooperstown  
today, while Carlton Fisk and Dale Murphy were outside 
possibilities on a ballot studded with top first-time candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Results from one of the most eagerly awaited elections in Hall  
history were to be announced at 2 p.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan, the greatest power pitcher in history, and Brett, one of  
the game's top hitters, figure to easily exceed the 75 percent 
needed in voting by 10-year members of the Baseball Writers' 
Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that happens, it will be the final thing that wraps up my  
career,'' Ryan said during the weekend. ``Obviously, it will be one 
of the greatest things that ever happened to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rarely, if ever, have so many quality names appeared for the  
first time. The list of holdover hopefuls is strong with Tony 
Perez, Jim Rice, Tommy John, Gary Carter and Bruce Sutter. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 26 players have been elected in their first year of  
eligibility, but only once have three been taken at the same time -- 
that was at the original election in 1936 when Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, 
Walter Johnson, Honus Wagner and Christy Mathewson were picked. 
</P>
<P>
	And lately, it's been getting harder and harder to get in, as  
300-game winners Don Sutton and Phil Niekro both had to wait 
several years for enshrinement. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the BBWAA has taken a total of only five players in the  
last six elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the years, Joe DiMaggio, Roy Campanella and Harmon  
Killebrew were among the candidates who did not get elected on the 
first try. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess it comes down to each individual who votes and what  
their criteria is,'' Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, that always leads to spirited debates, the kind that  
occur only in baseball. Do fans ever argue whether Phil Simms 
belongs in the NFL hall or if Dominique Wilkins deserves to be in 
the NBA shrine? 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the BBWAA voted in three players was 1991 -- Rod  
Carew, Ferguson Jenkins and Gaylord Perry. The last time it took 
four was 1955 -- DiMaggio, Gabby Hartnett, Dazzy Vance and Ted 
Lyons. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy, a two-time NL MVP, expected Ryan, Brett and Yount to  
make it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The three obvious ones are going to be there,'' he said. ``And  
anyone else who gets in is going to be a real bonus and such a 
departure from the norm over so many years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Induction ceremonies at Cooperstown are scheduled for July 25.  
The Hall of Fame exhibition will be the next day, and it seems 
fitting that Ryan's Texas Rangers will take on Brett's Kansas City 
Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hall's membership of 237 probably will increase again on  
March 2 when the Veterans Committee votes in Tampa, Fla. Former 
manager Dick Williams, Bill Mazeroski, Orlando Cepeda and Dom 
DiMaggio figure to draw support. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan set or shared 53 major league records when he retired in  
1993 after a 27-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan struck out 5,714, pitched seven no-hitters and went 324-292  
for the New York Mets, California, Houston and Texas, tying him 
with Sutton for 12th in victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he never won a Cy Young Award, and despite his .526  
winning percentage ranking the lowest among all 300-game winners, 
Ryan's sheer domination most likely will land him a place in the 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett is 13th on the career hits list with 3,154 and was a  
13-time All-Star. The third baseman hit .305 in a 21-year career 
spent entirely with the Royals, and is expected to easily make it. 
</P>
<P>
	Yount had 3,142 hits in 20 seasons with Milwaukee and won AL MVP  
awards at shortstop and center field. An All-Star only three times, 
his .285 average may put him on the borderline. 
</P>
<P>
	Not since that 1936 election, however, has a player with 3,000  
hits failed to be elected in his first year of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisk (376 HRs) holds baseball's record for most home runs by a  
catcher. In 24 seasons, his most memorable homer was the one that 
won Game 6 of the 1975 World Series at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy (398 HRs) won consecutive NL MVP awards with Atlanta. He  
was a seven-time All-Star and won five straight Gold Gloves in 
center field. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez is on the ballot for the eighth time, having come close  
with 68 percent last year. He had 1,652 RBIs, most among eligible 
players not already in the Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickey Lolich, 217-191 and MVP of the 1968 World Series, and  
Minnie Minoso, a .298 career hitter, are on the ballot for the 15th 
and final time.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam War Napalm To Destroyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FALLBROOK, Calif. (AP) -- More than 3 million gallons of napalm  
that's been stored at a San Diego naval station since the Vietnam 
War is going to be shipped to Louisiana to be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan announced Monday may solve a longstanding problem for  
the Navy. Over the years, it has dealt with everything from an 
infestation of rare Stephens' kangaroo rats, an endangered species, 
near where the napalm is stored to leaking canisters to local 
authorities' threats to sue if any of the incendiary jelly came to 
their hometowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3.2 million gallons of napalm has been stored in open fields  
at the Fallbrook Naval Weapons Facility in 35,000 aluminum 
canisters since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy officials declined to say how much Rhodia Inc., a chemical  
plant in Baton Rouge, La., will be paid to burn the napalm. 
However, getting rid of the stuff will cost about $39 million 
total, including other contracts to thin the napalm at a plant in 
Houston, put it into railroad cars and burn the wooden crates that 
held the canisters. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodia first talked to community leaders before signing the  
contract last week, and had launched a public relations campaign 
that was part of the deal with the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are permitted to burn this, we have burned all the  
components of this, our regulatory record and environmental record 
is good,'' plant manager Jerry Kring said. 
</P>
<P>
	But not all the key people were notified of the contract and  
don't like it, according to a spokeswoman for one of the state's 
leading environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is that 23 million pounds of napalm should not  
be sent 2,000 miles to be burned in anybody else's community,'' 
said Mary Lee Orr of the Louisiana Environmental Action Network. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the process of taking the napalm out of the  
canisters and putting it in railroad cars for shipping should begin 
within a month. The Navy hopes to process 100 canisters a day for

	The Navy said napalm -- a mixture of polystyrene, gasoline and  
benzene -- is far less volatile than common gasoline and will not 
explode without a fuse. 
</P>
<P>
	But the local protests last year derailed a plan to have the  
napalm destroyed at a plant in East Chicago, Ind. After the 
protests, Pollution Control Industries refused to accept a shipment 
in April and a Navy train carrying napalm was forced to turn 
around.

<HEADLINE> Magazine Editor Sues Marilyn Manson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Marilyn Manson has been sued by a magazine  
editor who claims two bodyguards for the shock rocker assaulted him 
last November. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Marks, the executive editor of Spin, filed a $24 million  
lawsuit Monday against Manson, his record companies and the firm 
that hired the bodyguards. The suit claims the bodyguards slammed 
Marks against a wall and choked him in a dressing room following a 
Nov. 23 concert in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	After the bodyguards released him, Manson allegedly told Marks,  
``That's what you get when you disrespect me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manson's lawyer, Paul Cambria, denied that attack happened.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our investigations show all of these accusations to be totally  
groundless,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marks suggested that the attack stemmed from his magazine's  
decision to drop plans to feature Manson, whose real name is Brian 
Warner, on Spin's January 1999 cover. 
</P>
<P>
	Police are investigating the incident, but no one has been  
arrested.

<HEADLINE> Conflict Enriches Djibouti Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DJIBOUTI (AP) -- Strategically situated at the entrance to the  
Red Sea, Djibouti has been trying for decades to establish its port 
as the most efficient in northeastern Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	A tiny former French colony of about 600,000, Djibouti derives  
around 75 percent of its annual income from the port and related 
services. And with the lucrative French military presence being 
scaled down to just 3,000 troops, the country is becoming even more 
dependent on the port. 
</P>
<P>
	As such, tens of million of dollars have been invested in the  
construction of modern facilities, including berths for fuel 
tankers and a specialized container terminal. Still, the port 
struggles to attract more than 1.5 million tons of cargo a year, 
far below its capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	Area crises, however, have helped Djibouti. In the early 1990s,  
during the Gulf War and Operation Restore Hope in neighboring 
Somalia, the port was inundated with business. 
</P>
<P>
	Now another crisis -- the border dispute between its neighbors,  
Ethiopia and Eritrea -- has produced another windfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after hostilities broke out in early May, landlocked  
Ethiopia transferred all its business from the Eritrean ports of 
Assab and Massawa to Djibouti. During the following three months, 
the port handled almost as much cargo as it did in the whole of 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the end of July, 117 more ships visited the port than  
during the year-ago period. The total volume of goods rose by 85 
percent, while imports destined for Ethiopia jumped by 671 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The sudden surge in traffic caught the port unprepared.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was very difficult in the beginning, '' said port general  
manager Aden Ahmed Dwale. ``All of Ethiopia's shipping fleet was 
suddenly diverted to Djibouti, and at the same time, we started 
receiving hundreds of extra trucks. But things are now under 
control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By hiring more than 1,000 additional workers and by operating 24  
hours a day, the port has so far managed to handle the influx of 
goods. But some local importers have been adversely affected. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a delay of between one to two weeks for Djiboutian  
importers because our shippers are all working 24 hours a day on 
imports for Ethiopia, '' said Omar Musa, vice-chairman of the 
Djibouti International Chamber of Commerce. ``There are not enough 
machines, and if you want to hire a truck, you have to put in an 
order 90 days before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trucks have proven to be a major headache for some. Before  
May, 60 trucks and fuel tankers passed through every day. The 
number has risen to 300, and the trucks have nowhere to wait 
outside so they park inside, clogging up the port. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is compounded by mountains of empty metal  
containers. Ethiopia does not have a container terminal in its 
capital, Addis Ababa, so the containers have to emptied in Djibouti 
and the cargo loaded manually into trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	In the next few months, 400,000 tons of fertilizer and grain --  
much of it food aid for the World Food Program -- are expected, and 
fears are growing that the port might seize up all together. 
</P>
<P>
	``The system is working efficiently at the moment,'' said Judith  
Lewis, WFP's country director for Ethiopia, ``But the crunch will 
come in the next few months because there will be so many more 
ships coming in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The port authorities are concerned, but they are confident that  
major problems will be avoided. What they are focusing on now is 
keeping the increased business once the Ethiopia-Eritrea conflict 
is resolved, something the port hasn't been able to do in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Dwale is adamant that even if the two countries settle  
their differences, the port of Djibouti will hang onto the lion's 
share of Ethiopian trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``This gives us the chance to reassert our historic role as  
Ethiopia's main port,'' he said. ``Considering the size of Ethiopia 
and its potential for economic growth, we hope that we will 
eventually be handling 10 million tons a year.''

<HEADLINE> USC's Claiborne To Enter NFL Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- USC linebacker Chris Claiborne, the 1998  
Butkus Award winner, said Tuesday he will skip his senior season 
and declare himself eligible for the NFL draft in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Claiborne won the Butkus Award as the nation's top college  
linebacker and was a unanimous All-America choice after leading the 
Trojans to an 8-5 record and a berth in the Sun Bowl. A three-year 
starter, Claiborne led USC with 128 tackles in 1998, including 
seven for losses, and six interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the only thing that has eluded him was playing in the  
Rose Bowl, but that alone wasn't enough to persuade him to return. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a little bit of unfinished business at SC, but I'm  
ready for a new challenge,'' Claiborne said. ``I did everything I 
could for this university. I'm ready to step up to a new level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Claiborne's announcement came as no surprise. The 6-foot-3,  
250-pound Pacific-10 Conference defensive player of the year had 
talked during the season about leaving early. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he didn't make a final decision until after an hour-long  
meeting with USC coach Paul Hackett on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked over every option, and I mean every option,''  
Claiborne said. ``We have a lot of good players coming up here. 
It's not like I'm leaving USC all alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Junior wide receiver R. Jay Soward, Claiborne's teammate and  
boyhood friend, said he would return for his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
	He caught 44 passes for a team-high 679 yards and six touchdowns  
in 1998, but was hampered by a late-season ankle sprain.

<HEADLINE> Lucas To End Star Wars Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The force may be with Luke Skywalker, but George  
Lucas says his is running out. 
</P>
<P>
	The creator of the Star Wars movies told Vanity Fair he plans to  
call it quits after the much-anticipated three part prequel to his 
blockbuster space trilogy. The long-standing perception has been 
that the complete Star Wars saga would be nine parts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never had a story for the sequels, for the later ones,'' he  
said in the Jan. 4 edition of the magazine. ``And also, I'll be to 
a point in my age where to do another trilogy would take 10 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas, 55, said he would ``probably not'' be open to letting  
someone else make Star Wars movies. 
</P>
<P>
	The first new movie in the new series, ``Star Wars: Episode I  
The Phantom Menace,'' is scheduled to be released in the United 
States on May 21. The film stars British actors Liam Neeson as a 
Jedi master and Ewan McGregor as a young Ben Kenobi. 
</P>
<P>
	Plot details remain largely under wraps, but Lucas said the new  
films will include the tale of how Anakin Skywalker, father of Luke 
and Princess Leia, became Darth Vader, the villain behind an eerie 
black mask. 
</P>
<P>
	There will also be a host of new aliens, including a  
computer-generated sidekick for Neeson's character. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've gotten much better performances out of my aliens this  
time,'' Lucas said, who cites the relative backwardness of 
computer-imaging technology in the early 1980s as one of the 
reasons he had stopped making Star Wars films. 
</P>
<P>
	Episodes II and III are promised for the years 2002 and 2005,  
Lucas said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. May Settle Black Farmers' Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Agriculture Department is about to make a  
multimillion-dollar settlement with black farmers who claim the 
department discriminates in the awarding of loans and subsidies, a 
spokesman for the farmers says. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's imminent,'' Sam Taylor told The Associated Press on  
Monday. Attorneys were expected to meet sometime today with the 
judge overseeing a lawsuit that had sought $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have very, very few points that are not in agreement,''  
Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Depending on how many farmers qualify, the settlement could cost  
the government as much as $375 million. 
</P>
<P>
	One source involved in the lawsuit told the AP that the two  
sides would seek the judge's initial approval of the settlement 
today. According to the settlement to be filed in court -- a copy of 
which was obtained by AP -- a formal hearing on the settlement will 
be Feb. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	At that time, class members who oppose the settlement may speak,  
the decree says. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plaintiffs have executed a consent decree which contains  
the terms of their proposed settlement and have requested the court 
to approve it,'' the decree reads. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit -- claiming years of discrimination through denial of  
farm loans, crop subsidies and other benefits -- was filed in 1997, 
shortly after the Agriculture Department admitted its own process 
of resolving discrimination complaints had been in disarray and had 
caused a huge backlog. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, farmers taking part in the lawsuit would  
get $50,000 tax-free payments from the government and any debts to 
the government would be erased, Taylor said. The average farmer's 
debt is between $75,000 and $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs say they already have 1,000 names in the lawsuit  
and estimate that as many as 2,000 more farmers could join the 
settlement. The government has used lower estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	While not confirming an agreement, Tom Amontree, spokesman for  
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, said, ``The president and 
secretary put in a lot of time on this issue and it looks like all 
that hard work is paying off. We hope to have a settlement soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Boyd, president of the National Black Farmers Association,  
said White House officials called him Monday to get his opinion on 
the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said I think it's fair,'' Boyd said today.  
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys on both sides are pushing to finalize the deal before  
U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman goes on a two-week vacation 
Wednesday, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is scheduled to go to trial Feb. 1. It covers claims  
from 1997 back to 1981. The department's civil rights office was 
disbanded by the Reagan administration in 1983. The Clinton 
administration restored the office in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement being finalized has three options for farmers.  
</P>
<P>
	The majority of farmers are expected to take the first option,  
which includes the $50,000 payment, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We surmise at least 85 to 95 percent of all claimants'' will  
take the first option because it has a lower standard of proof, 
Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	The second category is for farmers who have a better-documented  
case of discrimination and much higher damages, Taylor said. Those 
farmers would agree to have their cases settled by an independent 
arbitrator to be appointed by the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The final category would be an ``opt out'' category for a small  
group of farmers who are party to the lawsuit but may be near 
independent settlements with the Agriculture Department. Officials 
have been unable to settle those cases while the lawsuit was 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
	The pending deal is significantly higher than the  
$15,000-per-farmer offer the agency made this summer, plaintiffs 
said. But it still is less than the $3 billion the farmers 
initially sought. 
</P>
<P>
	Friedman gave the plaintiffs a significant victory in October  
when he agreed to certify them as a class. That same month, the 
department's inspector general complained that the agency's civil 
rights office remained in disarray with a significant backlog. 
</P>
<P>
	During a hearing in November, Friedman chastised attorneys over  
their inability to reach a settlement and questioned why the 
government, which had admitted discrimination, was unable to reach 
a deal.

<HEADLINE> Two Children Die in Newark Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A space heater sparked an apartment fire  
Monday night, killing two baby girls whose parents had left them 
alone to buy the children some milk, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls were ages 2 and nine months, police Sgt. Derek Glenn  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Their parents, Anna D'Almeida, 21, and Antonio Andrade, 27, each  
face two counts of endangering the welfare of a child, and could 
face additional charges, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Almeida wanted to buy milk for the children, and tried to  
drive the couple's new car, Glenn said. But the car has a manual 
transmission, and she had difficulty operating the stick shift. 
</P>
<P>
	She went back upstairs and told Andrade, who went downstairs and  
left the children asleep, Glenn said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He figured he'd go with her and show her how to drive it,'' he  
said. ``They figured they'd only be gone a few minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the couple returned from the store five blocks away, the  
apartment was ablaze. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn said the fire was started by an electric space heater in  
an adjacent apartment. Twelve families lived in the building, but 
police did not know how many apartments were destroyed.

Arabs to back Iraq and to rise up against Arab leaders who have not 
given his regime full support. The statement was broadcast hours 
after four U.S. fighter jets fired missiles at Iraqi planes in the 
``no-fly'' zone over southern Iraq. The official Iraqi News Agency 
said Iraqi planes ``confronted and clashed with the aggressive 
British and American aircraft'' before ``the aggressive aircraft 
withdrew. All of our air force planes returned to base safely.'' 
The incident marked an escalation of tensions between Iraq and the 
United States and Britain over enforcing the ``no-fly'' zones in 
northern and southern Iraq. Iraq considers the restrictions illegal

``criminalizing homelessness'' and are failing to take advantage of

now, a federal judge ruled. The issue landed in court after AT&AMP;T 
Corp. started using the phrase in December on its WorldNet e-mail 
service. Internet provider AOL had sought a temporary restraining 
order.

<HEADLINE> Credit Lyonnais To Cut 3,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French state-owned bank Credit Lyonnais plans to  
eliminate 3,000 jobs over the next three years, adding to thousands 
of earlier cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	A thousand jobs would be cut each year, reducing the work force  
to 27,000 by the year 2001, a bank spokesman, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity, said Tuesday. The cuts include 500 
employees who were scheduled for layoffs in 1998 but who are still 
on the payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank shed 4,500 jobs last year, offering workers early  
retirement, retraining or financial aid for starting new 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit Lyonnais lost the equivalent of $3.7 billion between 1992  
and 1994 and a state bailout package approved in 1998 cost French 
taxpayers about $17.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The French government has agreed to privatize the bank by  
October in order to meet conditions set by the European Commission 
for a recent state-aid package. 
</P>
<P>
	Unions representing Credit Lyonnais' staff staged street  
demonstrations in Paris last year to protest the likely loss of 
jobs that would accompany the privatization of the bank.

<HEADLINE> St. John's Cracks Top 10 in AP Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	St. John's had been absent from the Top Ten a lot longer than  
California had been missing from the rankings altogether. Yet 
players from both teams sounded the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have to play regardless,'' St. John's guard Bootsy  
Thornton said Monday when asked about the Red Storm's first 
appearance in the Top Ten since Dec. 16, 1991. ``The other teams 
don't stop playing because of a number.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cal guard Thomas Kilgore wasn't exactly overjoyed either about  
the Golden Bears entering the rankings Monday for the first time 
since a one-week appearance during the 1996-97 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, I take it with a grain of salt,'' he said. ``It's  
something that somebody labels you. Unnecessary pressure. The Top 
25 is good, but you still have to go out and perform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There weren't many changes in the latest AP college basketball  
poll as Connecticut was No. 1 for the sixth straight week, although 
the Huskies' lead over No. 2 Duke was sliced by 15 first-place 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut (11-0) was No. 1 on 55 ballots and received 1,756  
points from the national media panel after decisive wins last week 
over Villanova and Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils (13-1), who convincingly beat then-No. 4  
Maryland on the road Sunday, received 13 first-place votes and 
1,698 points. 
</P>
<P>
	In last week's poll, the Huskies had 63 first-place votes and  
1,763 points, while Duke had six and 1,687. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati (12-0), the only team to beat Duke this season,  
remained third after beating North Carolina-Wilmington in its only 
game last week. The Bearcats received three first-place votes, one 
more than the previous poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford and Maryland switched places at Nos. 4 and 5, while  
Kentucky moved up one spot to No. 6. UCLA, which handed Arizona its 
first loss of the season last weekend, moved from 10th to No. 7 and 
was followed by Arizona, Purdue and St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina, which holds the longest current streak of being  
ranked at 143 weeks, dropped from ninth to No. 11 after losing to 
California and beating Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tar Heels started their run of consecutive polls with the  
preseason poll of 1990-91, two polls longer than Kentucky's current 
streak and 10 longer than Kansas'. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State was 12th, followed by Indiana, Auburn, New  
Mexico, Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas, Arkansas and Syracuse. The last 
five teams in the poll were Clemson, Texas Christian, Oklahoma 
State, Wisconsin and California. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh (8-5) dropped out of the rankings from No. 23, having  
lost four of its last five games. The Panthers had been ranked for 
five straight weeks, reaching as high as No. 20, after beating 
Xavier and Kentucky on consecutive nights in the Puerto Rico 
Shootout. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky extended its streak of being in the Top Ten to 85  
polls, a run that started Feb. 14, 1994. Duke has the 
second-longest Top Ten streak at 33 weeks, while Connecticut, at 
17, and Stanford, at 10, are the only others in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
	This week was Kentucky's 600th appearance in the poll, a number  
second only to North Carolina's 608. UCLA, at 528, is the only 
other school to appear more than 500 times in the AP rankings, 
which started Jan. 20, 1949.

<HEADLINE> Alcohol Shown To Reduce Stroke Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Beer, wine, liquor -- all can help ward off  
strokes when consumed in moderate amounts, researchers reported 
today in the Journal of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that the type of alcohol consumed was  
unimportant. Any of them, or a combination, was protective. 
</P>
<P>
	``No study has shown benefit in recommending alcohol consumption  
to those who do not drink,'' cautioned the authors led by Dr. Ralph 
Sacco of Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	But the new data support the guidelines of the National Stroke  
Association, which say moderate drinkers may protect themselves 
from strokes by continuing to consume alcohol, the authors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The protective effect of moderate drinking against heart attacks  
is well established, but the data has been conflicting about 
alcohol and strokes, the authors said. They said the new study 
helps settle the question and is the first to find blacks and 
Hispanics benefit as well as whites. 
</P>
<P>
	More research is needed among other groups, such as Asians, whom  
past studies suggest may get no stroke protection from alcohol or 
may even be put at greater risk, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Among groups where the protective effect exists, its mechanism  
appears to differ from the protective effect against heart attacks, 
which occurs through boosts in levels of so-called ``good'' 
cholesterol, or HDL, the authors said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In our analyses, much of the protective effect of alcohol on  
stroke risk was independent of HDL,'' the authors said. 
</P>
<P>
	They speculated that alcohol may protect against stroke by  
acting on some other blood trait, such as the tendency of blood 
platelets to clump, which is key in forming the blood clots that 
can cause strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers studied 677 New York City residents who had  
strokes between July 1, 1993, and June 1997. For comparison, they 
enrolled 1,139 similar residents who had not suffered strokes. 
About half of the subjects were Hispanic, just over one-fourth were 
black and the remainder were white. Slightly more than half were 
women. The mean age was 70. 
</P>
<P>
	After taking into account differences in other factors that  
could affect stroke risk, such as high blood pressure, the 
researchers estimated that subjects who consumed up to two 
alcoholic drinks daily were only half as likely to have suffered 
clot-type strokes as nondrinkers. 
</P>
<P>
	Clot-type strokes account for 80 percent of all strokes, a  
leading cause of U.S. deaths and disability. 
</P>
<P>
	Stroke risk increased with heavier drinking. At seven drinks per  
day, risk was almost triple that of moderate drinkers, researchers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	An expert spokesman for the American Heart Association, who was  
not involved in the study, said it was well-done and important 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	But it shouldn't be interpreted to mean, ``I can have two drinks  
and therefore not worry about my high blood pressure or worry about 
my cholesterol,'' said Dr. Edgar Kenton, an associate professor of 
clinical neurology at Thomas Jefferson University Medical College 
in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he said, the study provides good reason to do further  
research and to add alcohol to the list of modifiable risk factors 
for stroke.

<HEADLINE> Woman Killed As Scared Kids Flee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANASSAS, Va. (AP) -- A woman was stabbed to death by her  
estranged husband in front of her two young children as witnesses 
scattered in terror, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deborah Ann Battle, 30, yelled ``Run!'' when she saw the man  
approaching as she escorted her children, ages 7 and 9, to her car 
Monday, a witness told police. The children were not injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Several high school students were standing at a nearby bus stop  
when the attack occurred, police said. An 11th-grade girl tried to 
intervene, but backed off as soon as she saw a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	``She approached them, but when she reached them and the man  
stood up, she saw the knife,'' Osbourn High School Principal Jack 
Graham said of the girl. ``That's when all of the kids took off. 
Some ran to the bus. Some ran home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Battle, 38, who had been served with divorce papers on Dec.  
8, turned himself in to the Prince William County magistrate's 
office about six hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	Battle was charged with first-degree murder, according to police  
spokesman Marc J. Woolverton. Battle was scheduled to be arraigned 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a heinous crime, particularly egregious since the  
small children were witness to such a violent act,'' Prince William 
Commonwealth's Attorney Paul B. Ebert said. 
</P>
<P>
	The children, identified as Battle's stepchildren, have been  
placed in the custody of the victim's mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the couple had been married for a little more than a  
year, but separated around Thanksgiving and Mrs. Battle obtained a 
protective order against him.

<HEADLINE> Vodafone Joins in AirTouch Bidding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Britain's largest mobile-phone operator has  
entered the bidding for AirTouch Communications Inc., the largest 
independent wireless company in the United States, challenging what 
is said to be a $45 billion offer from Bell Atlantic Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders sent AirTouch stock shooting up almost 14 percent on the  
news Tuesday, anticipating sweetened bids. Some analysts suggested 
it might make more sense for Bell Atlantic and Vodafone to split up 
AirTouch. 
</P>
<P>
	Vodafone Group PLC has its eye on AirTouch's fast-growing  
international assets, which stretch from Sweden to Egypt, but 
analysts questioned whether Vodafone wants to compete in the 
already-crowded U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	An AirTouch-Vodafone deal ``makes a lot of sense on an  
international basis,'' said Crispin Vicars, a telecom analyst with 
the Yankee Group in Boston. ``The are already partners on a number 
of European joint ventures, and the only market where they actually 
compete with each other is Germany.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic, which is based in New York and provides local and  
cellular phone service from Maine to South Carolina, wants 
AirTouch's business in the Western United States. Bell Atlantic 
needs a nationwide network to better compete against AT&AMP;T Corp.'s 
flat-rate cellular plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the clearly defined markets at home and abroad, some  
analysts advocate a deal that would have Bell Atlantic and Vodafone 
dismember AirTouch and share the spoils. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ideal situation is a three-way deal, where Bell Atlantic  
would acquire AirTouch's domestic cellular properties and Vodafone 
would keep the international business,'' said Stephen Parlett, an 
analyst with Montgomery Asset Management. 
</P>
<P>
	Both AirTouch and Vodafone confirmed the talks Tuesday and  
Vodafone cautioned there are no assurances any agreement will be 
reached. Bell Atlantic and AirTouch confirmed their talks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	All three companies declined to comment on the status of  
negotiations and the terms being discussed, but some shareholders 
said a breakup of San Francisco-based AirTouch would be too 
complicated. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that would be pretty difficult to do,'' said David  
Thompson, co-portfolio manager of First Funds Growth &AMP; Income I, a 
mutual fund which owns 569,000 shares of AirTouch's stock, just 
under 1 percent of the company's outstanding shares. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now there's a strong likelihood of a higher offer,''  
Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street seemed to agree as AirTouch's stock jumped $9.25 to  
close at $77.50 a share Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson estimated AirTouch, which was spun off from the  
regional telephone company Pacific Telesis Group in 1994, is worth 
between $80 and $85 a share, valuing the company at about $50 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Vodafone's investors seemed to see the advantages of linking up  
with AirTouch, too. Vodafone's U.S. shares climbed $4.50 to 
$179.12 1/2 on the NYSE, where Bell Atlantic gained $3.06 1/4 to $55. 
</P>
<P>
	Cellular phones, while a trendy convenience for some and an  
essential business tools for others, are fast becoming a new 
standard of communication around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of worldwide cellular phone subscribers is expected  
to soar from 285 million in 1998 to 615 million within four years, 
according to Strategis Group, a telecom consulting company in 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of that demand is expected to come from countries like  
China, India and Russia, where it is often cheaper to use cellular 
phones than to install traditional telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why you see these markets bypassing wired for wireless  
communication,'' said Elizabeth Harr-Bricksin, director of 
international wireless publications for Strategis. 
</P>
<P>
	AirTouch's balance sheet is tracking this trend: International  
cellular revenue grew almost 40 percent to $2.17 billion in the 
first nine months of 1998, while domestic sales in the cellular 
business increased 8 percent to $2.86 billion.

<HEADLINE> Dole Quits Red Cross, Eyes 2000 Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some are getting in. Some are getting out.  
More than a year before the first votes are cast, the field of 
Republican presidential hopefuls is slowly taking shape. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole, a Cabinet member in two GOP administrations and  
wife of the 1996 Republican presidential nominee, Bob Dole, said 
Monday she will leave her job as president of the American Red 
Cross to pursue a potential White House bid of her own. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may be another way for me to serve our country,'' she  
said at the organization's historic headquarters two blocks from 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Monday, Sen. John Ashcroft began telling surprised  
supporters that he won't run for president. The Missouri lawmaker, 
considered one of the Republican Party's strongest conservative 
contenders, had spent a year laying the groundwork for a campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Two supporters speaking on condition of anonymity said Ashcroft  
told them Monday he will focus on winning re-election to the 
Senate. Separately, conservative activist Paul Weyrich said: ``My 
understanding is, as one of his advisers, that he is not going to 
run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft was announcing in Springfield, Mo., today whether he  
would seek the presidency. His staff cautioned that even they 
didn't know what he would do. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft was said to be concerned that running for president  
would put his seat in jeopardy in 2000, when Republicans are at 
risk of losing control of the Senate. There also were questions 
about whether he could raise enough money, a doubt plaguing several 
potential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	In a lesson for other GOP hopefuls, Ashcroft also has found  
himself squeezed by competing interests within the party: He wanted 
to be the choice of social conservative leaders who dominate 
primary voting while appealing to mainstream voters for the general 
election. However, Ashcroft was criticized by conservatives last 
month when he tried to moderate his image to appeal to a broader 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire formed a presidential  
exploratory committee Monday. The step allows him to raise and 
spend money before beginning a formal campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Advisers said former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, a failed  
1996 presidential candidate, plans to form his committee Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole served as transportation secretary for President  
Reagan and labor secretary for President Bush. She is credited with 
stabilizing the Red Cross, which was under a cloud of scrutiny when 
she took over eight years ago. The safety of its blood supply, once 
the focus of government attention, is no longer in question. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Red Cross has been a glorious mission, but I believe there  
may be other duties yet to fulfill,'' she told Red Cross employees. 
Afterward, Mrs. Dole said she wanted to leave the nonpartisan Red 
Cross before actively considering a presidential campaign, but said 
she soon would begin talking to activists, potential donors and 
perhaps travel to key presidential states. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm giving it serious consideration,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole traveled aboard her own plane, kept her own schedule  
and was a nearly flawless surrogate for her husband in 1996. Her 
walk-through-the-audience performance at the Republican National 
Convention in San Diego won widespread praise. 
</P>
<P>
	She is trusted by many conservative activists and could help  
Republicans attract female voters, GOP analysts say. Polls 
consistently show Mrs. Dole earning the support of more than 10 
percent of GOP voters in several surveys. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush is considered the strongest of all  
potential candidates but he has not decided whether to run. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain of Arizona formed a presidential exploratory  
committee in December and would compete with Bush, Dole and 
Alexander for many of the same voters and donors from the party's 
establishment wing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft's departure could bolster the prospects for other  
Republicans courting social conservatives, such as former Vice 
President Dan Quayle, millionaire publisher Steve Forbes and 
religious activist Gary Bauer.

<HEADLINE> New House Offers Special Talents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Get to know the members of Congress: Two are  
physicists. One likes Ukrainian folk art. Forty percent are lawyers 
and 84 percent are married. There's a soccer mom, a former welfare 
mom, four Mr. Smiths and a rapper-wannabe who intones: ``Snatch the 
future back from the night. Let the mothers lead the fight!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the new House, being sworn in Wednesday, are an  
eclectic pack. There are singers, scientists and a riverboat 
captain. One is a ``Jeopardy'' champ. Another won the lottery. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of blacks, women, Hispanics and Asian-Americans has  
risen in recent years, but white male faces still would dominate a 
group photograph. Fewer are military veterans. And the number of 
lawyers is falling. 
</P>
<P>
	Special talents abound.  
</P>
<P>
	Rep. David Phelps of Illinois is a gospel singer and Rep. Debbie  
Stabenow of Michigan once sang folk songs in coffee houses. Rep. 
Gil Gutknecht of Minnesota went to auctioneering school. Rep. Matt 
Salmon of Arizona is fluent in Mandarin Chinese and Rep. James 
Oberstar of Minnesota speaks Creole. An inventor and scientist, 
Rep. Roscoe Bartlett of Maryland holds about 20 patents, mostly for 
breathing devices used by firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Mary Bono of California is a gymnast and practices martial  
arts. Ukrainian folk art fascinates Rep. Bob Schaffer of Colorado. 
Rep. Don Sherwood of Pennsylvania raises and shows Belgian horses. 
Rep. Rush Holt of New Jersey is a five-time champion of 
``Jeopardy.'' And Rep. Major Owens of New York has a passion for 
poems and raps he sometimes performs on the House floor. ``Fat cats 
want to buy your soul,'' raps Owens. ``Saving the children is the 
mothers' role.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congress by the numbers offers some insight:  
</P>
<P>
	--Of the 434 members, there are 222 Republicans, 211 Democrats  
and one independent. (The remaining seat, vacated by former House 
Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia, has not been filled.) 
</P>
<P>
	--The chamber has 58 women, 39 blacks, 20 Hispanics and five  
Asian-Americans. In the last House, there were 56 women, 38 blacks, 
19 Hispanics and four Asian-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	--The youngest is 28-year-old Rep. Harold Ford Jr. of Tennessee,  
who was elected in 1996. The oldest is Rep. George Brown Jr., 78, 
of California. 
</P>
<P>
	--Overall, about 84 percent are married. Eighty-eight percent of  
the men, but only 59 percent of the women, have spouses. 
</P>
<P>
	--Together, the representatives have more than 1,070 children.  
Rep. Ron Packard of California says he's a grandpa to 34. Dr. Tom 
Coburn, who represents Oklahoma, says he's delivered nearly 3,000 
babies. 
</P>
<P>
	--About 65 percent are natives of the states they represent. A  
dozen were born abroad. Rep. Peter Hoekstra of Michigan is from the 
Netherlands and now represents Holland, Mich. He keeps wooden shoes 
in his office. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond demographics, there are tales of how they entered  
politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Brady of Pennsylvania says he got his start in politics  
in 1965 when a committeeman failed to fix a burned out street light 
outside his mother's home. Rep. Mark Souder of Indiana says he was 
inspired to enter politics at age 14 when he heard former President 
Reagan deliver a speech. Rep. Jennifer Dunn of Washington says she 
got her start as a Reagan volunteer. She even named one of her sons 
``Reagan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their occupations and backgrounds are varied -- some  
unconventional. 
</P>
<P>
	Holt of New Jersey and Rep. Vernon Ehlers of Michigan are both  
physicists. Holt is a Democrat. Ehlers is a Republican. Holt says 
they joke about having a bipartisan physics caucus ``if we can find 
a room with a chalkboard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Don Young of Alaska, a former riverboat captain, claims to  
be the only licensed mariner in Congress. Rep. Judy Biggert of 
Illinois used to coach a school soccer team. Rep. Lynn Woolsey of 
California spent three years on welfare as a working mother. Rep. 
Christopher Cox of California helped provide an English version of 
the Russian newspaper Pravda. Rep. Bobby Rush of Illinois 
co-founded Illinois' Black Panther Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the millionaires is Rep. James Sensenbrenner Jr. of  
Wisconsin who won $250,000 in 1997 with a $1 lottery ticket he 
bought in Washington. ``Well, one of my jobs is to bring money from 
D.C. back to the state of Wisconsin, but I didn't ever think it 
would be this way,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the House have an estimated 120 graduate degrees.  
About 40 percent graduated from law school, but there used to be 
more, says Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar. The number of 
representatives with business or banking backgrounds has risen, he 
says. But the number of veterans is falling. According to 
Congressional Quarterly, only 31 percent spent time in the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find that extremely important,'' Ornstein says. ``Veterans  
tend to be more concerned about America's role in the world,'' he 
says. ``At least it's on their radar screen.''

<HEADLINE> Bears List Coaching Candidates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- The Chicago Bears, looking for a new  
head coach, plan to interview five NFL coordinators in addition to 
former UCLA coach Terry Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
	The team said it has received permission to talk to offensive  
coaches Jimmy Raye of Kansas City, Sherman Lewis of Green Bay and 
Joe Pendry of Buffalo, and defensive coaches Jim Haslett of 
Pittsburgh and Gunther Cunningham of Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Personnel director Mark Hatley, conducting the screening  
process, has ruled out Bears Hall of Fame linebacker Mike 
Singletary as a possible replacement for the fired Dave Wannstedt. 
Hatley said Singletary's lack of coaching experierce worked against 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatley said he will screen 16 or 17 candidates and submit three  
names to team president Mike McCaskey, who will have the final say. 
There is no timetable for the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it's going to be Jan. 10 or Feb. 1,'' Hatley  
said. ``We're going to go through the process till we find the 
right guy.''

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybean Prices Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices settled higher  
in trading Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures prices were boosted by forecasts of dry weather  
for Argentina and southern Brazil. While the market is moving 
higher because of the forecasts, the lack of rain in the region is 
not having an adverse impact on the soybean crop. Although no rain 
has fallen in a week and none is forecast for at least five days, 
subsoil moisture remains adequate. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures prices rose on expectation of increased demand by  
livestock producers for feed grain. With the Midwest and Plains 
states blanketed in Arctic cold, cattle and hog farmers are forced 
to feed the stock more to maintain their weight. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures prices were higher on the strength of corn and  
soybean futures. The market was helped by the U.S. Agriculture 
Department's tender for 695,000 metric tons of wheat in connection 
with its donor program. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery settled 1 1/4 cents higher at $2.80 1/4 a  
bushel; March corn was 2 1/2 cents higher at $2.17 1/4 a bushel; March 
oats were 1 1/4 cents higher at $1.08 3/4 a bushel; January soybeans were 
5 1/2 cents higher at $5.49 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle and pork futures prices surged higher in trading on the  
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The markets were boosted by the arctic 
weather now blanketing the Midwest and Plains states and the 
possibility it will linger, causing livestock to use most of their 
energy staying warm instead of growing, resulting in smaller 
animals going to market. 
</P>
<P>
	February live cattle were 1.05 cents higher at 60.67 cents a  
pound; January feeder cattle were 1.50 cents higher at 70.17 cents 
a pound; lean hogs were 2 cents higher at 32.72 cents a pound; 
February pork bellies were 1.28 cents higher at 44.05 cents a 
pound.

<HEADLINE>  Fulmer Carries National Trophy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Phillip Fulmer collected his trophies on  
Tuesday, then spoke softly about using a big walking stick to 
motivate Tennessee to its first national championship in 47 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In late October, Fulmer brought the gift from a longtime friend  
to practice and jokingly told a player if he couldn't understand 
the importance of playing Alabama, he'd have to use the stick on 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next thing I know, the kids are calling me Moses,'' Fulmer  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And the victories never ended.  
</P>
<P>
	Fulmer seized the opportunity to get the full attention of his  
players, who were 5-0 at the time and moving up steadily in the 
rankings. With Peyton Manning gone and star tailback Jamal Lewis 
out for the season with a knee injury, Fulmer was looking for 
another tool to keep his players united. 
</P>
<P>
	``I grabbed a hold of that one,'' Fulmer said. ``The next day, I  
had a meeting, and we talked about energy and synergy and focus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had the players sit in a circle and he stood in the middle of  
them, walking stick -- the synergy stick, he calls it -- in hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I gave it to the linemen, and they passed it around to all the  
positions,'' Fulmer said. ``We did it all year long. It was another 
way of bringing them back into focus. The kids bought into it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other than being called Moses, I thought it was a great  
idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new Bowl Championship Series was supposed to be a great  
idea, too, but the Volunteers' title-clinching 23-16 victory over 
Florida State in Monday night's Fiesta Bowl was anything but a 
classic. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles were playing for the first time in 44 days, while  
the Vols were off for a month after their 24-14 win over 
Mississippi State in the SEC title game on Dec. 5. The layoff was 
obvious: There were a total of seven turnovers, and 21 penalties 
for 165 yards in a game that resembled a spring game rather than 
one for the national title. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the play, obviously, was sloppy,'' Fulmer said. ``We  
had played a championship game, at least, and they had been off two 
weeks before that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State coach Bobby Bowden agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can't remember us playing in a bowl where we looked this  
futile,'' Florida State coach Bobby Bowden said after his bowl 
record dropped to 16-5-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State (11-2) finished No. 3 in the final Associated  
Press poll -- the 12th straight year the Seminoles finished in the 
top four. Ohio State (11-1) finished No. 2 behind the Volunteers 
(13-0), who completed their best season in 102 years of college 
football. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that Fulmer has reached the national championship level, he  
knows he'll be asked to do it again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the expectations at Tennessee are going to be high,''  
he said. ``They always are. With success comes expectations, and 
we're accustomed to that. We want to be in the mix.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And so does quarterback Tee Martin, who never tried to outdo  
Manning but ended up beating Florida and then leading the Vols to 
its second national title. Martin threw for 278 yards, with 
touchdown passes of 4 yards to Shawn Bryson and 79 yards to 
Peerless Price, the latter with 9:17 left that boosted the Vols' 
lead to 20-9. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has the strength a lot of us wish we had ourselves,''  
Fulmer said. ``He doesn't have to be somebody else. He doesn't want 
to be. He just wants to play within the system and be a guy that 
can make plays that you don't draw up. Those are his strengths.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Can he come back and win another title?  
</P>
<P>
	``He can get better, and he will,'' Fulmer said. ``Whether the  
results will be the same, or better, it's hard to say. We won 13 
games. It will be very difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the Vols were the unanimous choice as national  
champs, Fulmer still says the BCS has enough flaws that he still 
prefers a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have an 11-1 football teams that gets left out of the  
alliance, that really upset me,'' Fulmer said, referring to teams 
such as Kansas State this season, and North Carolina the previous 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``That shouldn't be that way. The best teams should have a  
chance to play (for a title) because the expectations are always 
high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the current system, put together to create a No. 1  
vs. No. 2 bowl game every season, is better than past plans, but 
said: ``I'd still like to see a playoff. I still think that's the 
way to go, but I'll be the first to say I do not have the answer to 
how you do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He does have the answer to winning a national championship --  
speak softly and carry a big stick.

<HEADLINE> Automakers Report Strong Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- U.S. sales of cars and light trucks ended on a  
strong note in 1998 for most automakers, including Ford Motor Co. 
and DaimlerChrysler AG, which reported several sales records for 
both December and the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The trend was the same as it has been for several years: soaring  
sales of light trucks -- sport utility vehicles, pickups and vans -- 
overcame declining demand for cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said its sales increased 7 percent in December over  
year-ago levels. For the year, Ford's sales rose 2 percent for its 
best year since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler had its best year ever, with a 9 percent  
increase over 1997. For December, sales were up 7 percent. The 
figures do not include DaimlerChrylser's results for Mercedes-Benz, 
which are reported separately. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp., the biggest automaker, planned to release  
its figures Wednesday, when yearend industry totals will be 
calculated. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts and executives said a strong economy was behind the  
surge. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's easy credit and high consumer confidence,'' said  
analyst David Healy of Burnham Securities Inc. ``Both companies' 
actual results were better than either of them anticipated earlier 
this month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's SUVs -- the Explorer, Mercury Mountaineer and Lincoln  
Navigator -- set sales records in December. Sales of the Ford 
Mustang were also up sharply after the introduction of a reskinned 
model. The F-series pickup set a record for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler had continued strong sales of its Dodge Durango  
SUV and Chrysler Concorde/300M sedans. It also saw a spike in 
minivan sales in December. Jamie Jameson, vice president of North 
American sales and marketing, said sales improved without new 
rebates and other incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	Most other automakers also posted higher sales in December.  
Nissan Motor Co.'s sales increased 12 percent, thanks to a surge of 
orders for its light trucks. Even its car sales, which had been 
down for a few months, showed a 7 percent improvement. But for 
1998, the company's sales were down 14 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Major European automakers, including Mercedes-Benz, BMW and  
Volkswagen, said their sales zoomed in December. Mercedes-Benz was 
up 8 percent, BMW increased 15 percent and Volkswagen rose 48 
percent. Mercedes set a record for the year, with sales up 39 
percent. Volkswagen's sales for the year were up 59 percent for its 
best year since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the few automakers to see a decline was Hyundai. The  
Korean automaker's sales dropped 61 percent in December, and were 
down 20 percent for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Healy said it was likely that sales would decline slightly this  
month, but said a strong economy should keep car lots busy well 
into the first half of this year.

<HEADLINE> Marlins Players Lobby Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Florida Marlins players are working the phones in a  
bid to win back the good will of disgruntled fans and thank those 
who have renewed season tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, surprised fans seem to appreciate the calls. At least no  
one has hung up. 
</P>
<P>
	Marlins reliever Matt Mantei and newly acquired catcher Jorge  
Fabregas got the ball rolling on this unprecedented public 
relations move. Though it has been done at the minor league level, 
no one could recall a major leaguer calling up fans to sell 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Season ticket holders account for 60 percent of our fans,''  
said Lou DePaoli, Marlins director of season and group sales. 
``We've got a long list of people to thank. Every major league club 
would love to have their players coming in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mantei, who inherited the Marlins' closer role when Robb Nen was  
traded to the San Francisco Giants, is better known to fans as 
``Ice-Man,'' the name given to him by ex-Marlins pitcher Al Leiter. 
</P>
<P>
	``One guy said, `Who? Ice-Man, you kidding me, man?,''' said  
Mantei, who had nine saves last season. ``We're trying to bring the 
fans back to baseball in South Florida so this year maybe they'll 
be cheering for me and Jorge, and not yelling at us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, the Marlins lost 108 games after the dismantling of  
the 1997 world championship team. They drew an average of 22,157 
fans a game, ranked 21st of 30 teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Mantei and Fabregas were eased into their new role by the  
Marlins sales staff on Tuesday, but on Thursday were scheduled to 
come back and deliver a much tougher pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got them on training wheels now; eventually they'll call  
the season ticket holders that are on the fence and ask them to 
renew for next year,'' DePaoli said. ``We're telling the fans to 
put the past 18 months behind us and let's move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The unique sales promotion was the brainchild of Jim Ross,  
Marlins vice president of sales and marketing. Several other 
players will be coming in to call fans on Tuesdays and Thursdays 
for the next five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most fans are shocked at first and don't believe I'm a  
ballplayer,'' Mantei said. ``Then we'll just talk like normal 
people ... I hope the fans appreciate what we're doing.''

<HEADLINE> Reputed Miami Gang Lord Captured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Police stormed a motel room Tuesday and captured a  
reputed gang leader believed to be at the center of a turf war that 
has left 12 people dead in the Miami area since August. 
</P>
<P>
	As Anthony ``Little Bo'' Fail and two others ate pizza, an FBI  
team tossed a stun grenade into the room in West Palm Beach and 
arrested Fail, who had eluded capture by moving from one location 
to another every night. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't offer any resistance. He said, `Yeah, I'm the guy  
you're looking for,''' said Miami police Lt. Carlos Alfaro. ``He's 
been on the run for so long. He seemed relieved to get it over 
with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they got a tip as to what kind of car Fail was using  
and tracked it to the motel. 
</P>
<P>
	Fail, 25, was charged with three counts of attempted murder in  
two shootings. One of the wounded was an 8-year-old girl who was 
caught in gunfire in a grocery store in August. Police had 
identified Fail from the store's surveillance videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, gang violence escalated in mostly poor Liberty City  
in a struggle for control over the neighbhorhood's drug trade. The 
struggle pitted Fail's followers against members of the gang he 
once belonged to, the John Does, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	To date, no one has been charged in the 12 slayings that have  
resulted. The victims have included Fail's girlfriend, who was 
killed in a drive-by shooting Dec. 1, as well as a cousin and a 
friend of his. 
</P>
<P>
	To try to stop the violence, federal agents and local  
authorities started Operation Draw the Line last week, sending 
extra uniformed and undercover officers and police cruisers into 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Police received hundreds of tips after a $10,000 reward was  
offered for information leading to Fail's arrest. Fail, along with 
a man and a woman who were not identified, had rented the motel 
room under the woman's name. 
</P>
<P>
	Fail, who got his nickname because he was bowlegged as a child,  
also faces charges in an unrelated 1997 attempted murder, and 
police said they may file other charges soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very violent guy,'' Lt. John Campbell said. ``He was a  
cause of a lot of the shooting. They're going to keep killing each 
other, but hopefully this will slow things down a bit.''

	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Phillip Fulmer collected his trophies on

top four. Ohio State (11-1) finished No. 2 behind the Volunteers 
(13-0), who completed their best season in 102 years of college 
football. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that Fulmer has reached the national championship level, he  
knows he'll be asked to do it again. 
</P>

he said. ``They always are. With success comes expectations, and

	Can he come back and win another title?  
</P>
<P>
	``He can get better, and he will,'' Fulmer said. ``Whether the  
results will be the same, or better, it's hard to say. We won 13 
games. It will be very difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the Vols were the unanimous choice as national  
champs, Fulmer still says the BCS has enough flaws that he still 
prefers a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have an 11-1 football teams that gets left out of the  
alliance, that really upset me,'' Fulmer said, referring to teams 
such as Kansas State this season, and North Carolina the previous 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``That shouldn't be that way. The best teams should have a  
chance to play (for a title) because the expectations are always 
high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the current system, put together to create a No. 1  
vs. No. 2 bowl game every season, is better than past plans, but 
said: ``I'd still like to see a playoff. I still think that's the 
way to go, but I'll be the first to say I do not have the answer to 
how you do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He does have the answer to winning a national championship --  
speak softly and carry a big stick.

<HEADLINE> Rose To Coach in Independent League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Pete Rose is returning to baseball, as  
a hitting instructor for an independent minor league team that 
isn't covered by the ban imposed on baseball's hit king in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Portner, owner of the expansion Sacramento Steelheads of  
the Western League, said Tuesday that Rose had turned down an offer 
to manage the new team. 
</P>
<P>
	But Portner said Rose agreed to sign a personal services  
contract that will include participating in three to four days of 
hitting clinics for Steelhead players in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose will also throw out the first pitch at the Steelheads home  
opener on May 28 and make a variety of other appearances during the 
team's 90-game schedule, Portner added. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to do a Pete Rose golf tournament for charity in  
Sacramento, an evening with season ticket holders with Pete Rose 
and baseball clinics for kids of Sacramento, things like that,'' 
Portner said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the amount of money that will be paid to Rose had not  
been determined. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to put together a list of all the things I would like  
him to do and we will package it all up to determine the value of 
it,'' Portner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose was banned from baseball in 1989 by then-commissioner Bart  
Giamatti for allegedly betting on games while managing the 
Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose's banishment does not extend to the Western League, which  
operates outside of Major League Baseball's farm system and is 
roughly equivalent to Class A minor league ball. 
</P>
<P>
	During his 24-year playing career, Rose set records for most  
hits, games played and at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	Portner said Rose decided that he had too many other commitments  
to manage the Steelheads this season, but Portner said he would ask 
Rose to manage the team next year.

                          *Duke of Rutland    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The 10th Duke of Rutland, owner of vast estates in  
northern England and two of the country's finest houses, died 
Saturday of cancer. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	The duke, born Charles John Robert Manners, fought a battle with  
the government Coal Board in the 1970s when it tried to develop 
mines in the Vale of Belvoir, which had some of the best farming 
land in Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire. 
</P>
<P>
	He served in the army's Grenadier Guards in France and Germany  
during World War II. He was 20 when he inherited the dukedom on his 
father's death in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
	The duke was active for much of his life in county and local  
government and in the Conservative Party, and was a successful 
businessman as head of Rutland Hotels Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Belvoir Castle has been remodeled and rebuilt several times --  
most recently after a fire in 1816 that destroyed many famous 
paintings. A vast residence in the Regency style, it has more than 
150 rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	The Manners family's second great house is Haddon Hall in  
Derbyshire, northern England. Much of the building dates from about 
1370, and with its famous rose gardens has been described as the 
most romantic house in England.

	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Jose Vela Zanetti, a Spanish painter best  
known for his mural depicting human rights at the U.N. headquarters 
in New York, died Monday of heart failure. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Vela Zanetti went into exile in 1939 during the Spanish Civil  
War. His father had been killed by fascist supporters of late 
dictator Gen. Francisco Franco at the war's outset in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
	On leaving Spain, Vela Zanetti first moved to the Dominican  
Republic. He later spent time and produced hundreds of murals in 
the United States, Mexico, Colombia and Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Best known for paintings of peasant farm workers and rural  
scenes, his most famous work is the giant mural `La Lucha del 
Hombre por La Paz'' (Man's Struggle For Peace) in the U.N. building 
in New York.

<HEADLINE> 106th Congress Likely To Start Slow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The impeachment trial and the political  
ill-will it has engendered ensure the new Congress will get off to 
a slow start and may stall in its core business of making law. 
Still, there's hope that 1999 could finally be the year for major 
Social Security and managed health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
	The 106th Congress opens Wednesday, but for at least the first  
few weeks there's only one thing on the agenda: the Senate 
impeachment trial of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., eager to get the  
trial behind him, is looking at proposals that would put a tight 
time limit on it so the Senate can conduct legislative work. 
</P>
<P>
	He is backed in that effort by Senate Minority Leader Tom  
Daschle, D-S.D., who has made clear that Democrats will block all 
legislative action until the trial ends. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously that (legislative) agenda is going to be affected  
dramatically'' until the impeachment issue is resolved, Daschle 
said Tuesday on C-Span. 
</P>
<P>
	The House on Wednesday will reappoint the 13 House Republicans  
who will serve as prosecutors in the Senate trial. The House also 
will do some housekeeping chores, including easing a 1995 decision 
to bar members from receiving any gifts at all from lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they will adopt the less restrictive Senate standards  
that allow gifts, including meals, valued at up to $50, with a $100 
cap on gifts from any one source in a year. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, the House will recess at least until Clinton's State  
of the Union address, now scheduled for Jan. 19. That speech could 
be delayed because of the impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	When the House does finally go to work, speaker-to-be Dennis  
Hastert, R-Ill., says he's determined to reduce the partisan 
squabbling thought to have cost the Republicans seats in the 
November election. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not going to be easy, but Hastert said Americans are  
demanding good legislation from Congress, adding, ``I've always 
been a person who believes that we need to work across the aisle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First up will likely be some of the many bills left over from  
the last Congress. That includes a measure to tighten bankruptcy 
law that the House and Senate passed in different forms last year 
and a much-debated plan to store more than 40,000 tons of nuclear 
waste at a Nevada desert site. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration and the Democrats probably will resubmit  
bills to overhaul campaign finance rules and to impose a national 
settlement on the tobacco industry. Democrats will hold a little 
more sway as Republicans drop to an 11-seat majority in the House -- 
the result of Election Day losses and the resignation, effective 
last Sunday, of former Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. However, the 
Democratic legislative efforts, including another push to raise the 
minimum wage, are sure to be resisted strongly by the GOP 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	There's more room for compromise in defense, where Republicans  
have welcomed Clinton's pledge to boost spending by $110 billion 
over six years but insist that's still not enough to improve 
readiness. The Republicans are also determined to build a national 
anti-missile defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides have also recognized the need to do more concerning  
education. The White House wants to continue funding for a program 
to hire 100,000 elementary school teachers and new money for school 
construction. The GOP stress is on more local control, better 
teachers and new ideas such as education savings accounts that 
promote family choice. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also wide agreement that patients must be better  
protected from the abuses of managed care providers, and this may 
be one area where public pressure might force a compromise. Last 
year the hang-up was the Democratic demand, opposed by Republicans, 
that consumers have the right to sue health plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Saving the Social Security system -- now expected to go broke in  
2032 -- is the feature issue of both parties. Clinton recently 
showed some flexibility toward GOP proposals that Americans be able 
to invest some of their retirement funds privately, and Republicans 
have promised to work with the White House if it produces its own 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We spent a year making it safe to talk about Social  
Security,'' White House budget director Jack Lew said Sunday on 
CNN. ``Now is the time to roll up our sleeves and get to work. 
There's not going to ever be a better time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House opposes any major tax cuts until the Social  
Security issue is settled, but is proposing tax credits for people 
with long-term care responsibilities and for child care. 
Republicans want across-the-board tax relief and will again work to 
change tax rules that penalize two-income married couples, but say 
a major tax bill may be at least a year away.

<HEADLINE> Dollar at 2-Year Low vs. Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar dropped to its lowest level against  
the Japanese yen in more than two years Tuesday on worries about 
the U.S. economy. The U.S. currency, however, gained against the 
new European common currency, the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar slid to levels against the yen not seen since October  
1996, as comments from an influential Japanese finance official 
amplified concerns about the expected slowdown in U.S. economic 
growth in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's deputy finance minister for international affairs,  
Eisuke Sakakibara, was quoted in a Japanese business daily as 
predicting a stronger yen and weaker U.S. economy in the new year. 
The comments were released Monday for the Tuesday issue of the 
Nihon Keizai Shimbun, but continued to impact the dollar in 
Tuesday's trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was trading at 111.21  
Japanese yen, down from 112.07 late Monday. The euro was quoted at 
$1.1771, down from $1.1806. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's gain against the euro came as enthusiasm for the  
European unified currency waned in its second day of trading and 
dealers pulled back to evaluate its prospects. The euro debuted 
strongly Monday from its designated starting point of $1.1668 and 
traders believe it could one day challenge the dollar as the 
international currency of choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro at a fixed rate. 
Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.6617 German 
marks, up from 1.6567 late Monday; 1.3712 Swiss francs, up from 
1.3673; 5.5741 French francs, up from 5.5556; 1,644.74 Italian 
lire, up from 1,639.34 
</P>
<P>
	The British pound, which is not part of the euro, was quoted at  
$1.6554, down from $1.6570. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5140 Canadian dollars, down from  
1.5268.

<HEADLINE> Falcons, 49ers in Classic Rematch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- Three weeks after undergoing heart surgery,  
Dan Reeves sounds like he'll be back with the Atlanta Falcons for 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL's coach of the year received a clean bill of health  
after an examination Monday morning, then spent the rest of the day 
huddled with his assistants, working on a game play for Saturday's 
divisional game against the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves broke away from the meetings long enough to speak by  
telephone on his weekly radio show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a great day,'' Reeves said on WGST. ``My energy level is  
getting better and better. ... Hopefully, I will get a good night's 
rest and be ready to go (today). I have a chance to be on the 
sidelines Saturday. We'll just have to wait and how it goes during 
practice this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, who is taking blood thinner medication, may have to work  
out of the press box coaching booth because of all the bodies 
flying around on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	But he has resumed driving himself to the Falcons' suburban  
training complex. Last week, doctors instructed him to use a driver 
and sit in the backseat, lessening the chance of injury if there 
was a wreck. 
</P>
<P>
	``Knowing coach Reeves, I would speculate that he'll probably be  
in the booth somewhere,'' Anderson said. ``I don't think he'll be 
on the sideline because of the risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive coordinator Rich Brooks has been the acting head coach  
since Reeves underwent quadruple bypass surgery on Dec. 14 and 
missed the final two games of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know exactly what Dan will be involved in this week,''  
Brooks said. ``Last week, he just told me to keep doing what I'm 
doing. I guess that's what I'll do until he tells me otherwise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves and the rest of his NFC West champion Falcons got a  
chance to relax over weekend and await their opponent for the first 
postseason contest in Atlanta since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	The answer didn't come until Sunday evening, when Terrell Owens  
grabbed a 25-yard touchdown pass with three seconds remaining, 
giving the San Francisco 49ers a 30-27 victory over the Green Bay 
Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have the advantage by the fact that we were able to  
watch and rest up this weekend,'' All Pro running back Jamal 
Anderson said. ``I didn't do anything. I left my house maybe three 
times. I just rested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers, who finished two games behind Atlanta (14-2) in the  
division, handed the Falcons one of their losses. In the third game 
of the season, San Francisco built a 31-7 lead by halftime at 3Com 
Park and cruised to a 31-20 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	In the rematch, with the teams tied for the NFC West lead, the  
Falcons responded with a 31-19 victory on their home field, 
snapping a five-game losing streak against the 49ers. Atlanta 
finished the regular season with a nine-game winning streak to 
claim only the second division title in team history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's destiny that we play the 49ers,'' defensive end Chuck  
Smith said. ``In the first game, they dominated. In the second 
game, we dominated. This is like a grudge match.''

	Sen. Ashcroft Won't Run for President  
</P>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- Republican Sen. John Ashcroft announced  
today he would seek a second Senate term rather than run for 
president. Analysts say Ashcroft faces a tough re-election 
challenge from popular Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan in 2000, when 
the Republican Party risks losing its Senate majority. Ashcroft's 
decision comes a day after Elizabeth Dole announced she will pursue 
a potential White House bid of her own.

	U.S. Warplanes Fire on Iraq Planes  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Four U.S. warplanes fired air-to-air missiles  
at Iraqi planes today in a confrontation in the ``no-fly'' zone 
over southern Iraq, a senior U.S. administration official said. The 
U.S. missiles apparently failed to hit the Iraqi planes, although 
one Iraqi plane was believed to have crashed, apparently after 
running out of fuel, the official said. The incident marked an 
escalation of tensions between Iraq and the United States and 
Britain over enforcing the ``no-fly'' zones in northern and 
southern Iraq. Iraq considers the restrictions illegal.

	UN: US, Brit Workers Face No Threats  
</P>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- U.S. and British humanitarian aid workers  
have not encountered security problems in Iraq despite tensions 
between their governments and Baghdad, a U.N. official said today. 
Iraqi officials yesterday asked the United Nations to replace U.S. 
and British aid workers because Baghdad said it cannot protect them 
from anger from Iraqi citizens after U.S.-led airstrikes on the 
nation. The humanitarian workers oversee a U.N.-approved 
oil-for-food program.

	Bitter Cold Settles in After Storm  
</P>
<P>
	MERIDIAN, Miss. (AP) -- Bitter cold temperatures are settling in  
across most of the nation today in the aftermath of a storm that 
dumped as much as two feet of snow in some areas. Temperatures were 
in the teens across much of the South, with Meridian, Miss., 
hitting a record low for the date of 11 and even New Orleans 
chilling to a record 20. Thermometers at Lincoln and Champaign, 
Ill., registered lows this morning of 25 degrees below zero. At 
least 60 deaths have been blamed on the weather.

	Grammy Nominations To Be Handed Out  
</P>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Lauryn Hill, Celine Dion, Shania  
Twain and Will Smith are among the favorites today to receive 
Grammy Award nominations. The 41st annual awards ceremony will be 
held next month in Los Angeles. Hill's ``Doo Wop (That Thing)'' is 
a favorite for nomination as record of the year, along with Dion's 
``My Heart Will Go On,'' and Twain's ``You're Still the One.'' 
Natalie Imbruglia's big radio hit ``Torn'' is a contender for best 
record. Hill and Dion were expected to compete for best album.

	Police Search for Indonesia Inmates  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesian police searched today for  
44 prisoners who escaped after mobs attacked a jail during deadly 
anti-military riots in a troubled province. Authorities have 
recaptured only one inmate since the jailbreak Sunday in Aceh 
province, where at least 12 people were killed in weekend fighting 
between soldiers and residents. Hundreds more were injured. 
Resentment toward the military remains deep in Aceh, and last week 
villagers and suspected guerrillas killed seven soldiers and 
kidnapped two others. Indonesia, deep in an economic crisis, has 
been plagued by civil unrest over the past year.

	Woman Killed In Front of Kids  
</P>
<P>
	MANASSAS, Va. (AP) -- A woman was stabbed to death by her  
estranged husband in front of her two young children as witnesses 
scattered in terror, police said. Deborah Ann Battle yelled 
``Run!'' when she saw the man approaching as she escorted her 
children, ages 7 and 9, to her car, a witness told police. The 
children were not injured. John Battle turned himself in to police 
and has been charged with first-degree murder. He was served with 
divorce papers last month.

	Feds Wrapping Up Microsoft Case  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is close to wrapping up its  
antitrust case against Microsoft, preparing to call as its final 
witness an economist who believes the computer software giant 
represents a ``predatory'' monopoly. Franklin Fisher, an economics 
professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is the 
government's last announced witness in its lengthy antitrust case 
against Microsoft. The company's lawyers were expected to begin 
questioning Fisher as early as today. Microsoft will begin calling 
its witnesses next week.

	Dow Up About 53  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks are higher today, with blue-chips lifted  
by IBM and AT&AMP;T and technology stocks stronger despite fears that 
they would retreat. Just before 11 a.m. EST, the Dow industrials 
were up 53.81 to 9,238.08. The Nasdaq was up 16.70 to 2,224.75.

	Orioles Might Play Game in Cuba  
</P>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles could be playing baseball  
in Cuba this year as part of a U.S. initiative to build ties with 
the Communist country. The games will be allowed only if profits go 
to humanitarian assistance in Cuba and not to the Fidel Castro 
regime, a senior U.S. official said. The Orioles have tried to play 
exhibition games in Cuba since at least 1996, but the Treasury 
Department has rejected the requests as out of line with trade 
policy. The United States imposed an economic embargo against Cuba 
when Castro took power in 1959.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche Signs All-Star Ozolinsh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- All-Star holdout defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh has  
signed a multi-year contract with the Colorado Avalanche, the team 
announced late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozolinsh will rejoin his team Wednesday and play against the  
Florida Panthers at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal were not announced.  
</P>
<P>
	Reports said the team offered a three-year, $9.8 million  
contract, but Ozolinsh, a Group II free agent, was seeking $4.5 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozolinsh, 26, had remained at his home in Latvia until recently,  
but attended Monday's Avalanche game against the Montreal Canadiens 
in Denver. He has played in the NHL All-Star Game each of the past 
two seasons. He had 13 goals and 51 points last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozolinsh had been with the Avalanche, now 17-18-3, for three  
years and was on Colorado's 1996 Stanley Cup championship team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche leads the Northwest Division of the Western  
Conference by three points.

<HEADLINE> James To Leave Miami for NFL Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) -- Edgerrin James, the University of  
Miami's record-setting running back, said Tuesday he will pass up 
his senior season to enter the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	James set a single-season rushing record with 1,416 yards and 19  
touchdowns during the regular season. He is only one of three Miami 
backs to rush for more than 1,000 yards and the only one to do it 
in consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought this was an opportunity I should go for right now,''  
the 20-year-old James told reporters. ``Just thinking how the 
season went, this year was the right time. Things have turned out 
real well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James said he expects to be a first-round pick.  
</P>
<P>
	The junior from Immokalee, Fla., helped his cause when he ran  
for a school-record 299 yards and three touchdowns in Miami's 49-45 
upset of UCLA on Dec. 5 in the Orange Bowl. His stock improved 
among NFL scouts with his 156-yard performance in Miami's 46-23 win 
over North Carolina State in the Micron PC Bowl on Dec. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	James, 6-foot-1 and 220 pounds, set a school record with 14  
100-yard games, including six in a row to end the 1998 season. He 
tied the school record with 35 career touchdowns.

<HEADLINE>  Senate Takes Up Impeachment Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Impeachment trial proceedings against  
President Clinton will begin Thursday in the Senate, Majority 
Leader Trent Lott announced today, saying he hopes for a conclusion 
that is ``fair and hopefully quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, R-Miss., said he had met earlier in the day with Senate  
Democratic leader Tom Daschle and Chief Justice William Rehnquist, 
who will preside over the first presidential impeachment trial in 
130 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott offered no other details of the trial, in which the Senate  
will rule on two articles of impeachment the House approved Dec. 19 
and decide whether Clinton will be removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyers, who were not privy to the discussions on  
Capitol Hill, were left scratching their heads. ``It leaves them in 
the position of preparing for all eventualities,'' said 
presidential press secretary Joe Lockhart. ``In general, we'd like 
to know which direction we're going in but we understand the 
process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The articles allege that Clinton committed perjury and  
obstructed justice in an attempt to cover up his relationship with 
Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a constitutional duty here. It is a very serious one.  
It is one we must carry forward,'' said Lott. ``We will do our very 
best to do this in a proper way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``At the end of the day, I'm going to do my best to  
make sure we complete our constitutional duties under the rules of 
the Senate and come to a conclusion that is fair and hopefully 
quick also.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott spoke for only a few moments, and took no questions from  
reporters, leaving unclear precisely what events will occur 
Thursday and what the timetable will be for Clinton's trial. 
</P>
<P>
	A proposal authored by one Republican and one Democratic senator  
for a truncated procedure drew criticism from several GOP 
lawmakers, many of them conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Several sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said  
Senate leaders are discussing a plan under which Rehnquist on 
Thursday will administer a constitutionally prescribed oath to the 
senators, who will sit as jurors. Members of the House who are 
designated to present the evidence would formally outline the 
articles of impeachment later that day, assuming they are 
authorized to do so in a House vote scheduled Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, a pause in the proceedings is possible, while both  
sides draft legal papers, sources added. 
</P>
<P>
	``We anticipate that that would start Thursday the 7th and then  
beyond that will be determined by the discussions'' with the rank 
and file, Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new 106th Congress is scheduled to convene Wednesday, and  
the impeachment trial -- the first of a president since Andrew 
Johnson in 1868 -- towers over the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott has been struggling to find a formula for a trial, but has  
been buffeted with criticism from some Republicans who opposed a 
proceeding that was likely to end after only a few days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I simply believe we must accept our responsibility to conduct  
the impeachment trial, followed by a vote to remove or retain the 
president,'' GOP freshman Sen. Rod Grams of Minnesota told Lott in 
a letter Monday. He cautioned against a proposal to ``shortcut the 
procedure'' envisioned in the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Daschle, D-S.D., said today a majority of  
senators want to expedite the proceeding against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The longer this drags out, the more acrimonious, the more  
political and the less helpful it'll be,'' he said on NBC's 
``Today.'' ``We ought to be looking for solutions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the criticism of a quick solution has come from  
conservatives, but Sen. Arlen Specter, a moderate Republican 
recently elected to his fourth term, also expressed strong 
misgivings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is very difficult to conduct a trial if you don't  
have witnesses,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Many if not all Senate Democrats back the proposal for a test  
vote after a brief presentation of the evidence against the 
president, and the White House served notice during the day that it 
was preparing a hard-nosed defense in the event of a full-blown 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Advisers familiar with the developing defense strategy said  
lawyers are working on trial motions concerning evidence and an 
opening presentation that would sharply attack the House 
conclusions and the evidence from Independent Counsel Kenneth 
Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening presentation ``would be far more extensive and  
sharper in tone and content'' than the one Clinton's lawyers made 
before the House Judiciary Committee in arguing the evidence didn't 
warrant impeachment, said one lawyer who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved two articles of impeachment on Dec. 19,  
accusing Clinton of perjury and obstruction of justice in 
connection with an attempt to conceal his sexual relationship with 
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	That set the stage for a Senate trial, and the rank and file of  
both parties will caucus separately on Wednesday before the new 
Congress is sworn in in an effort to agree on a procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	The bipartisan plan was advanced last week by Sens. Slade  
Gorton, R-Wash., and Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	It proposes that after House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde  
presented evidence for one day, the White House would have a day 
for rebuttal followed by another day of speeches by lawmakers. Then 
the Senate would take a quick vote to determine whether a 
full-blown trial should proceed. Unless two-thirds of the Senate 
voted in favor of such proceedings, the lawmakers then would be 
free to turn to censuring Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	In a news conference in his home state of Washington on Monday,  
Gorton said the plan he and Lieberman developed would proceed only 
if a majority of each party supported it. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats apparently are in favor, and his ``best guess'' is  
that a majority of the Senate agrees, but ``Senator Lott will 
propose the plan, I believe, only if a majority of Republicans 
favor it,'' Gorton said. 
</P>
<P>
	While last month's House vote largely wrapped up the House's  
role in the first presidential impeachment since 1868, officials 
said Monday that lawmakers must vote again on Wednesday -- shortly 
after Congress convenes -- to authorize key lawmakers to formally 
lay out the case against Clinton at any Senate trial.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Challenges Gov't Witness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trying to discredit the government's final  
witness in its antitrust case, Microsoft Corp. is challenging an 
economist's estimates showing dramatic increases since 1997 of 
people using the company's Internet software. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft expects to spend the rest of the week questioning  
Franklin Fisher, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist. 
He took the witness stand Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's lawyer, Michael Lacovara, noted several previous  
court cases where Fisher had testified unsuccessfully, including 
one in which he was criticized by a judge as ``unreliable'' and 
another where a judge complained that Fisher had been ``not more 
than cursorily familiar'' with the issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know what's going to happen on re-direct, don't you?''  
Fisher replied sharply, referring to the opportunity for the 
Justice Department to pose Fisher more favorable questions about 
cases where he has testified successfully. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacovara also quizzed Fisher about his technical expertise;  
Fisher acknowledged never having previously studied or testified 
about Internet software, computer operating systems or a myriad of 
other areas central to the government's case. 
</P>
<P>
	But Fisher maintained he had a fair understanding of those  
issues, adding: ``I don't believe intimate knowledge of the 
technology is necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government contends Microsoft used its influence as the  
maker of the dominant Windows operating system to intimidate 
high-tech companies into distributing its Internet browser 
software. It alleges a broad campaign designed to ``crush'' rival 
Netscape Communications Corp., which sells a competing browser. 
</P>
<P>
	In 110 pages of written testimony made public earlier in the  
day, Fisher warned of the ``danger that Microsoft's existing 
monopoly power will be used to monopolize other critical markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If Microsoft is permitted to ... put itself in the position to  
control and ultimately exact a monopoly toll for efficient access 
to the Internet -- the economic costs to consumers and the economy 
will again be substantial,'' Fisher wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft will begin calling its witnesses -- starting with MIT  
economist Richard Schmalansee -- next week. Fisher noted on the 
stand Tuesday that Schmalansee had been his thesis student.

<HEADLINE> Davis Wins Offensive Player Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- It didn't take long for the Denver Broncos to  
realize they had a rare gem Terrell Davis, their sixth-round draft 
pick of 1995. It took even less time to begin restructuring the 
offense around the running back. 
</P>
<P>
	As Davis became more and more the focal point of the Denver  
offense, displacing John Elway, the Hall of Fame-bound quarterback 
was forced to admit, ``It's Terrell's team now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, the backbone of one of the NFL's most prolific offenses,  
was selected Tuesday as The Associated Press Offensive Player of 
the Year. It was Davis' second such award in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis claimed his first NFL rushing title, gaining 2,008 yards  
to become only the fourth player in league history with 2,000 yards 
in a season. He ran for more yards than 22 NFL teams, and he also 
led the NFL with 23 touchdowns and 21 rushing scores. He was the 
only unanimous selection to the All-Pro team announced last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis succeeds another 2,000-yard rusher, Detroit's Barry  
Sanders, in winning the award. He received 19 votes from a 
nationwide panel of 47 sports writers and broadcasters, edging 
Minnesota quarterback Randall Cunningham, who got 15 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels great to receive stuff like that,'' said Davis, last  
year's Super Bowl MVP who helped the Broncos to a 14-2 record this 
year. ``With me, I don't go on the field striving to shoot for 
goals like that. But it's something that's definitely rewarding, 
when you go out there and you work hard and people recognize the 
hard work and effort you've put forth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The effort Davis put forth was memorable. Davis sparked the  
Broncos to the AFC's most productive offense, scoring 501 points. 
Denver also was 13-0 before losing two of its final three games, 
but finished with the conference's top record. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, it's always an offensive goal or a team goal,'' the  
four-year pro said. ``When I receive something, I think everybody 
else should receive the same kind of accolades. On this team, it's 
the line doing a great job of blocking, also Howard (fullback 
Howard Griffith) and the receivers downfield. And, of course, 
having John back there helps tremendously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith, who does much of the blocking for Davis, also saw  
Davis' yardage as a team accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's really a tribute to the things he's done in the  
offseason to prepare himself for a stretch run,'' Griffith said of 
Davis' diligent offseason training. ``It's also a credit for the 
team to have played as hard as it played. It's not very often a 
team can go 14-2 and have a 2,000-yard rusher. Generally when 
there's a 2,000-yard rusher, you're right around the .500 mark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In just four seasons, Davis eclipsed Floyd Little as the  
Broncos' leading career rusher (6,413), a feat that took Little 
nine years to accomplish. Davis has rushed, in succession, for 
1,117, 1,538, 1,750 and 2,008 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I came here (in 1997),'' Griffith said, ``Terrell and I  
were talking about this being the beginning of something special. 
All I wanted to do was better his numbers. We keep bettering them 
every year. Now it's starting to get a little tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis beat out Cunningham, the All-Pro quarterback who led the  
NFL in passing while guiding the Vikings to a league-best 15-1 
mark. Teammate Randy Moss, the Offensive Rookie of the Year and the 
most dangerous receiver in the game this season, drew six votes. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco quarterback Steve Young, 1992's top offensive  
player, received two votes, as did Atlanta running back Jamal 
Anderson. New York Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde got one. 
</P>
<P>
	The only player from a losing team to earn votes was running  
back Marshall Faulk of the Indianapolis Colts (3-13), who got two. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis is the only Bronco ever to win the award. He is the ninth  
running back to take the honor, with only Sanders and Earl Campbell 
winning it more than once. Campbell was Offensive Player of the 
Year from 1978 through 1980.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Would Also Lose Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If the impeachment case against President  
Clinton led to conviction in a Senate trial, Clinton would lose far 
more than his job. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1958 law, Clinton would lose his $151,800 annual  
pension. He also would lose related benefits funded by Congress, 
such as the annual stipend former presidents traditionally receive 
to run an office and staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Congress may change that law, presidential and  
constitutional scholars said that is unlikely, even given Clinton's 
current stratospheric job approval ratings. The national mood may 
well change if the impeachment process leads to Clinton's removal 
from office, scholars said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ordinary people will probably be outraged if he got a pension  
if he was impeached and convicted,'' said Akhil Reed Amar, a 
constitutional scholar at Yale University Law School. 
</P>
<P>
	Punishment could stop with the provisions of the 1958 pension  
law, but the senators who would be Clinton's jury in an impeachment 
trial this month could also take other steps. The Constitution 
spells out some possible consequences of a Senate conviction. 
Others could be negotiated by the White House, senators and 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators, if they chose, could disqualify Clinton from seeking  
federal office again. Such punishment would take a separate, 
majority vote in the Senate, after the two-thirds vote required to 
convict and remove the impeached president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's unlikely, and it's piling on, but the Senate  
could do it,'' said Dennis W. Johnson, a George Washington 
University political science professor who teaches a course on the 
relationship between the White House and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton could also face criminal prosecution for perjury or  
other charges related to his relationship with a former White House 
intern. Several impeached federal judges were criminally prosecuted 
in addition to being thrown out of office by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have never had a president that was removed from office, so  
there's no specific precedent,'' said Mark Klugheit, Senate special 
counsel during the 1989 impeachment trial of former federal judge 
Alcee Hastings. In that case, the Senate convicted Hastings of 
bribery charges and removed him from office even though he had been 
acquitted years before in a criminal trial. He is now a Democratic 
House member from Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``Criminal prosecution depends on a bunch of things, including  
whether Starr believes impeachment is enough, or if he feels 
further prosecution is warranted,'' Klugheit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr has indicated he might not press for criminal prosecution,  
and such an assurance could be part of any negotiated deal to 
censure Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, criminal prosecution is probably the heaviest sword over  
Clinton's head, since it carries the potential for a felony 
conviction, jail time and loss of voting rights and other 
privileges. 
</P>
<P>
	The House impeached Clinton on Dec. 19 on charges of perjury and  
obstruction of justice in the investigation of his relationship 
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitution lays out the next step -- a trial in the Senate  
-- and stipulates that ``judgment,'' or a sentence, is limited to 
removal from office, a ban on future federal office and possible 
criminal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	But since it has the power of the purse, Congress could punish  
Clinton further by refusing to pay for things such as a pension and 
office expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus it is possible, although unlikely, Clinton could lose his  
Secret Service protection if Congress refused to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress recently considered cutting off the lifetime allowances  
for ex-presidents' staff and office space, but then quietly 
continued the payments. The four living ex-presidents received 
about $2.2 million in 1998, including their pensions, with Ronald 
Reagan receiving the largest payment of $700,800. 
</P>
<P>
	Secret Service protection is funded separately, and while the  
agency generally decides for itself who merits protection, its 
approximately $600 million annual budget ultimately comes from 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	When President Nixon resigned in disgrace over Watergate, he did  
not lose his pension or other benefits. By pardoning Nixon, 
President Ford spared him possible criminal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other president impeached by the House, Andrew Johnson  
in 1868, was acquitted in the Senate by a single vote.

<HEADLINE> Tennessee No. 1 in Final AP Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Trophies were the order of the day for  
Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after his Volunteers completed a perfect season with a  
23-16 victory over Florida State in the Fiesta Bowl Monday night, 
Fulmer collected the hardware -- national championship trophies for 
finishing No. 1 in The Associated Press' media poll and the USA 
Today/ESPN coaches' poll 
</P>
<P>
	Fulmer also received the MacArthur Bowl, presented by the  
Football Writers Association of America, as the nation's top team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been an incredible run by an incredible team that refused  
to say die,'' Fulmer said Tuesday. ``It's an honor to receive these 
trophies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee was the unanimous choice of the 70 sports writers and  
broadcasters who vote in the AP poll. The Volunteers (13-0) ended 
up with a perfect score of 1,750 points. The Vols also won the 
title in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State (11-1), which defeated Texas A&AMP;M 24-14 in the Sugar  
Bowl, moved ahead of Florida State and finished No. 2 for the 
second time in three seasons. The Buckeyes, the preseason No. 1 
whose only loss came against Michigan State Nov. 7, finished second 
to Florida in the final 1996 poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State (11-2) fell to No. 3, but extended to 12 years its  
streak of finishing in the top four of the final AP poll. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised we were third in the nation,'' Florida State  
coach Bobby Bowden said Tuesday. ``I was afraid we'd drop to five 
or six. I thought we had broken our string. Now we can go after it 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona, 12-1 after a 23-20 victory over Nebraska in the Holiday  
Bowl, finished No. 4, followed by Florida (10-2), Wisconsin (11-1), 
Tulane (12-0), UCLA (10-2), Georgia Tech (10-2) and Kansas State 
(11-2). 
</P>
<P>
	In the final USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll, Tennessee was No. 1,  
and the rest of the top five were Ohio State, Florida State, 
Arizona and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Tulane, which beat Brigham Young 41-27 in the Liberty Bowl, was  
the only other Division I-A team with a perfect record. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas State, upset by Purdue 37-34 in the Alamo Bowl for its  
second straight loss, dropped six places from the final 
regular-season poll. UCLA, 38-31 losers to Wisconsin in the Rose 
Bowl, dropped two places. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas A&AMP;M was No. 11, followed by Michigan, Air Force, Georgia,  
Texas, Arkansas, Penn State, Virginia, Nebraska and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cornhuskers, 9-4 after their loss to Arizona, fell five  
places to No. 19 for their lowest ranking since the end of the 1990 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri was No. 21, followed by Notre Dame, Virginia Tech,  
Purdue and Syracuse.

<HEADLINE> Blues Unfazed by Record Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Before becoming the St. Louis Blues' general  
manager, Larry Pleau thought of his future employer as the NHL's 
renegade organization. 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't alone.  
</P>
<P>
	``Throughout the league, there was no doubt about it,'' Pleau  
said. ``Everybody was looking at the Blues, whether it was driving 
up salaries or signing free agents or whatever it would be. But 
nobody was able to substantiate it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until now. More than four years after the fact, and with the  
wrongdoers long gone, Pleau and his superiors find themselves 
picking up the pieces after the team was assessed an NHL-record 
$1.5 million fine for tampering with defenseman Scott Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the money, the Blues must surrender a first-round  
entry draft pick to the New Jersey Devils, Stevens' team in 1994 
when St. Louis jumped the gun and offered a four-year, $17.5 
million free agent deal months before the signing period began. The 
Devils, among the NHL's elite teams, also get to swap first-round 
picks with the Blues once in the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues' reaction: They'll soldier on, just as they did during  
a 14-year stretch from 1982-95 when they had a total of five 
first-round draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman Jerry Ritter, president Mark Sauer and Pleau, who all  
came aboard after the violations, promise it'll be business as 
usual for a franchise that's been far less flamboyant since Mike 
Keenan was fired in December 1996 as general manager and coach 
after a wild 2 1-2-year ride. 
</P>
<P>
	At least the tampering is one thing for which Keenan can't be  
blamed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know enough about it to give you a fair comment,''  
Keenan said after his Canucks lost 4-0 to the Blues Monday night in 
St. Louis. ``I don't know what transpired during that time. It 
never came up at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though the blow hurts, there's a sense of pride in the voices of  
the current front office that none of the problems occurred during 
their watch. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NHL comes down hard on the Blues?'' Ritter said. ``It  
could be that the Blues in the past have called it upon 
themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sauer rejects the notion the Blues have been singled out for  
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think so,'' he said. ``I think our actions singled  
ourselves out, whether we like it or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sauer said it's been a tough task cleaning up after the  
impulsive management team led by former president Jack Quinn, whose 
obsession with Stevens -- who led the Blues to 105 points in 1990-91 
-- was far from his only excess. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Quinn, now retired in Arizona, the Blues single-handedly  
boosted the league's salary structure with big offers to Brett 
Hull, Stevens and Brendan Shanahan before he handed over too much 
power to the even more impulsive Keenan. 
</P>
<P>
	When Pleau and Quenneville came aboard in 1997, only Hull  
remained from the Keenan reign, and the Blues will be paying out 
millions to former players for years. An emphasis on team play and 
defense helped the Blues score 98 points last season, and they're 
two games above .500 this season despite the loss of their top two 
scorers to injury, Pierre Turgeon and Geoff Courtnall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're right on schedule if not ahead or where we  
wanted to be, digging out of Chernobyl,'' Sauer said. ``This is a 
disappointment, it's a shocking disappointment, but this isn't 
going to change what we're doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than ever, the emphasis will be on scouting and uncovering  
hidden talent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have confidence in our scouting staff and our  
commitment to find players,'' Quenneville said. ``We're not going 
to alter course. We'll have to deal with it and we'll be all 
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players on the current roster are hoping Quenneville is right.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know nothing about what happened back then,'' right wing  
Terry Yake said. ``By the sounds of it, it's going to be 
unfortunate, but that's not my department.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Mint Distributes New Quarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Mint is shipping out the first  
batches in a new series of quarters that will eventually feature a 
different picture on their tails side for each of the 50 states. 
</P>
<P>
	But it could be spring or summer before you find one of the new  
coins -- which start with a design commemorating Delaware -- among 
your pocket change. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to say where they're going to show up first,'' said  
mint director Philip Diehl. That's because they are going into 
stockpiles at regional Federal Reserve banks around the country and 
will be distributed as needed, Diehl said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the mint sent the first truckloads to the central  
bank's regional branches in Baltimore, Chicago, Jacksonville, Fla., 
and Philadelphia. The Philadelphia branch serves Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
	Collectors' sets won't be available until sometime this summer,  
but in the meantime, the mint will track sightings of the new 
quarters via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's really part of the fun of this: the treasure hunt of  
looking for each of these coins in pocket change,'' said Diehl. 
</P>
<P>
	The first new quarters to roll off the mint's presses in  
Philadelphia and Denver commemorate Delaware because it was the 
first state to ratify the Constitution. On their tails side, the 
American eagle is replaced by Revolutionary War figure Caesar 
Rodney, mounted on a galloping horse. 
</P>
<P>
	In a ride nearly as famous in its day as Paul Revere's, Rodney  
raced 80 miles from Dover, the Delaware state capital, to 
Philadelphia in 1776, to cast his vote approving the Declaration of 
Independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The mint will produce 700 million to 750 million Delaware coins  
over 10 weeks, then switch to a design commemorating Pennsylvania. 
New Jersey, Connecticut and Georgia will follow during 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	A profile of George Washington remains on the heads side of all  
the coins. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next 10 years, every state will get its turn in the  
order in which they approved the Constitution or joined the union, 
finishing with Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, Alaska and Hawaii in 
2008. 
</P>
<P>
	Delaware approved the Constitution on Dec. 7, 1787.  
</P>
<P>
	Congress voted last year to diversify quarters, which were last  
changed -- temporarily -- to depict a colonial drummer for the 
nation's 1976 bicentennial. State governors will choose the new 
designs, and in many cases are seeking ideas from the public.

<HEADLINE> Alcohol Shown To Reduce Stroke Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Similar to the way a drink or two a day protects  
against heart attacks, moderate alcohol consumption wards off 
strokes, a new study found. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also found that the type of alcohol consumed -- beer,  
wine or liquor -- was unimportant. Any of them, or a combination, 
was protective, researchers reported in Wednesday's Journal of the 
American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``No study has shown benefit in recommending alcohol consumption  
to those who do not drink,'' cautioned the authors, led by Dr. 
Ralph L. Sacco of Columbia University College of Physicians and 
Surgeons in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	But the new data support the guidelines of the National Stroke  
Association, which say moderate drinkers may protect themselves 
from strokes by continuing to consume alcohol, the authors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The protective effect of moderate drinking against heart attacks  
is well established, but the data has been conflicting about 
alcohol and strokes, the authors said. The new study helps settle 
the question and is the first to find blacks and Hispanics benefit 
as well as whites, according to the authors. 
</P>
<P>
	Further research is needed among other groups, such as Asians,  
whom past studies suggest may get no stroke protection from alcohol 
or may even be put at greater risk, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Among groups where the protective effect exists, its mechanism  
appears to differ from the protective effect against heart attacks, 
which occurs through boosts in levels of so-called ``good'' 
cholesterol, or HDL, the authors said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In our analyses, much of the protective effect of alcohol on  
stroke risk was independent of HDL,'' the authors said. 
</P>
<P>
	They speculated alcohol may protect against stroke by acting on  
some other blood trait, such as the tendency of blood platelets to 
clump, which is key in forming the blood clots that can cause 
strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers studied 677 New York residents who lived in the  
northern part of Manhattan and had strokes between July 1, 1993, 
and June 1997. For comparison, they enrolled 1,139 similar 
residents who had not suffered strokes. About half of the subjects 
were Hispanic, just over one-fourth were black and the remainder 
were white. Slightly more than half were women. The mean age was 
70. 
</P>
<P>
	After taking into account differences in other factors that  
could affect stroke risk, such as high blood pressure, the 
researchers estimated that subjects who consumed up to two 
alcoholic drinks daily were only half as likely to have suffered 
clot-type strokes as nondrinkers. 
</P>
<P>
	Clot-type strokes account for 80 percent of all strokes, a  
leading cause of U.S. deaths and disability. 
</P>
<P>
	Stroke risk increased with heavier drinking. At seven drinks per  
day, risk was almost triple that of moderate drinkers, researchers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	An expert spokesman for the American Heart Association, who was  
not involved in the study, said it was well-done and important 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	But it shouldn't be interpreted to mean, ``I can have two drinks  
and therefore not worry about my high blood pressure or worry about 
my cholesterol,'' said Dr. Edgar J. Kenton, an associate professor 
of clinical neurology at Thomas Jefferson University Medical 
College in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he said, the study provides good reason to do further  
research and to add alcohol to the list of modifiable risk factors 
for stroke.

<HEADLINE> Marino Stats Don't Match Elway Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- In their only two meetings on a football field,  
Dan Marino clearly outplayed John Elway. Marino also leads Elway -- 
and the NFL, for that matter -- in nearly every important career 
statistical category. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for two. Elway has an NFL-record 148 victories as a  
starter compared to Marino's 142, and, in the category that matters 
most, Elway wears a Super Bowl ring while Marino doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
	In pursuit of that elusive ring, Marino brings his Miami  
Dolphins to Mile High Stadium for Saturday's AFC divisional playoff 
game against Elway's Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino and Elway, who faced off only once in their first 15 NFL  
seasons, will be meeting for the second time in 19 days. With 
Marino throwing for 355 yards and four touchdowns, the Dolphins 
beat the Broncos 31-21 in Miami on Dec. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is kind of odd that we went all those years without playing  
a regular season game,'' Marino said Tuesday. ``Now it's been -- 
what? -- three weeks, and we're going to play them again. That's 
just the way things work out sometimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until the recent Monday night encounter, Marino and Elway,  
co-valedictorians of the Quarterback Class of 1983, squared off 
only in 1985, when the Dolphins beat the Broncos 30-26 in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves Marino with a 2-0 record in games against Elway,  
during which he has thrown for 745 yards and seven touchdowns, with 
one interception, compared to Elway's 401 yards, no touchdowns and 
three interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway was the sentimental favorite of the fans and many players  
to win a ring last season. Is it Marino's turn? 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't necessarily feel that way,'' Marino said. ``If I'm  
lucky enough to get close enough to that, and hopefully that's the 
case, it will be great. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I'm thinking about going to Denver and winning this  
game and moving on. If it comes up and that's the case, that would 
be outstanding. I would relish the chance to have that 
opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino watched in admiration -- and a little bit of envy -- when  
Elway and the Broncos beat Green Bay 31-24 in the Super Bowl last 
Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was happy for him,'' Marino said, ``because he had a chance  
and he worked so hard his whole career and it was exciting to 
see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino and Elway are the only quarterbacks in NFL history with  
at least 50,000 yards passing in their careers. Marino has 58,913 
and Elway 51,475. Marino, 37, intends to continue playing, while 
Elway, 38, has announced that this is his last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked on Tuesday if he would feel sorry for Marino if the  
Broncos, favored by 13 points, prevail this weekend, Elway said 
with a laugh, ``No, because I know that he's got 10 years left. 
Actually, he said he was going to play two or three more years, so 
he'll get his shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for his future, Marino said he was ``not putting any  
timetable on it. I'd like to continue to play. I'm just going to 
enjoy what I'm doing right now, and whatever the future brings, it 
brings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Would he walk away if he wins a Super Bowl? ``I'm not sure,''  
Marino said. ``That's something that you don't even think about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway said Marino's desire to stay in the game ``has a lot to do  
with having that Super Bowl ring. Maybe he would think differently 
about it if he had that ring. I'd like to talk to him about it. I 
know how I feel physically. Maybe he feels a heck of a lot better 
than I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two quarterbacks, good friends off the field, have a mutual  
admiration society. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan is so competitive and he's a winner,'' Elway said. ``When  
you look back at what he's done statistically throughout the years 
and being able to do it consistently over a long period, to me 
that's greatness. His quick release is probably the thing that 
stands out most.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino said he respected Elway's toughness and ``his ability to  
throw any pass on the field at any time. The thing that he does so 
great is he can create on his own by moving out of the pocket and 
making plays downfield and also running it.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Credit Lyonnais To Cut Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French state-owned bank Credit Lyonnais may cut  
1,500 jobs in 1999 if it goes ahead with a new employment plan, a 
French newspaper reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The troubled bank's executive committee met Monday to discuss  
the new plan, which outlines the elimination of 1,000 jobs in 1999, 
according to the financial daily La Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional 546 jobs, originally slated to go at the end of  
1998, will be added to this year's total, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit Lyonnais officials weren't immediately available to  
comment on the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The French government has agreed to privatize the bank by  
October of this year in order to meet conditions set by the 
European Commission for a recent state-aid package. La Tribune said 
it isn't clear whether the bank will cut the jobs prior to the 
privatization. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit Lyonnais lost 21 billion francs ($3.7 billion) between  
1992 and 1994 and a state bailout package approved earlier this 
year cost French taxpayers over 100 billion francs ($17.9 billion).

<HEADLINE>  Japanese Stock Prices Plunge / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese share prices plunged for the second day in  
a row today as the dollar's weakness against the yen sent 
export-sensitive stocks tumbling. The U.S. currency fell against 
the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped 183.15  
points, or 1.37 percent, to 13,232.74 points at the end of the 
day's trading session. On Monday, the average lost 426.28 points, 
or 3.08 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. currency bought 111.52 yen at midafternoon, down 2.34  
yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York 
level of 112.07 yen overnight. The dollar last traded below the 112 
yen level in June of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, investors sold shares of technology and  
automobile stocks amid fears that a lower dollar could lead to 
reduced earnings for these export-oriented companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``The weaker dollar and stronger yen will put a brake on export  
growth, and this is bad for the economy,'' said Masaaki Higashida, 
a manager at Nomura Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section closed down 16.59 points, or 1.56 percent, to 1048.33 
points. The TOPIX closed down 22.07 points, or 2.03 percent, the 
day before. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 340.86 million shares changed hands on the first  
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Declines outnumbers advances 
829 to 299, with 147 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency exchange, the U.S. dollar plunged to its lowest  
level in almost 19 months, due in part to the euro's strong debut 
on foreign exchange markets Monday, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar fell as low as 110.70 yen early on but staged a  
partial recovery later as traders rushed to cover short, or 
oversold, positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The euro's robust debut Monday confirmed the fact that the  
majority of market players feels uneasy about holding dollars,'' 
said Yukihiko Hashimoto of Sanwa Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was trading at dlrs 1.1810 at midafternoon in Tokyo,  
lower than dlrs 1.1828 late Monday in New York. The euro was at 
dlrs 1.1873 in Tokyo late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the new currency traded quietly against the dollar in  
Tokyo, it gyrated wildly against the yen today, swinging between 
132.88 yen and 130.94 yen in morning trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was at 131.92 yen at midafternoon, down from 132.76 yen  
earlier in Tokyo and below 132.39 yen in New York late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The plunge below 131.00 yen was blamed on position unwinding by  
players who bought too much of the new currency during its debut on 
Monday, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Comments by Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's influential deputy  
finance minister for international affairs, also propped up the 
yen, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking about an article in today's Nihon Keizai business daily  
in which he was quoted predicting a stronger yen in 1999, 
Sakakibara said, ``I only meant that the dollar won't rise to the 
140 yen level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to comment on the dollar's drop below 112 yen  
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said growing pessimism about the prospects for the  
American economy, as well as a narrowing interest rate differential 
between the U.S. and Japan, also weighed on the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, a U.S. Federal Reserve official's warning that  
economic growth was unlikely to continue growing at its current 
pace triggered a late-afternoon drop on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 9,184.27 points  
Monday, up just 2.84 points. It had gained as much as 168.64 points 
in earlier trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.910 percent from Monday's finish of 1.990 percent, 
driving its price up to 99.11 from 98.48 yen.

<HEADLINE> More Small SUVs Headed to Showrooms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- One has a global positioning system and a roof of  
tinted amber glass. Another features a lift-out picnic table and on 
its own can disable side air bags when a small child -- or no one, 
for that matter -- is in the seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Sound unreal? Guess again, say automakers who unveiled such  
innovations Tuesday at the North American International Auto Show. 
</P>
<P>
	At the media preview, many automakers offered up compact,  
car-based sport utility vehicles aimed more at styling about town 
than off-road exploring. 
</P>
<P>
	In one so-called hybrid vehicle melding attributes of SUVs,  
sedans and minivans, Ford Motor Co.'s Lincoln-Mercury division 
introduced its unconventional ``my.'' To its manufacturer, the 
five-door, bulbous concept car represents a ``go-anywhere, 
do-anything'' vehicle that further blurs the distinction between a 
car and SUV. 
</P>
<P>
	Not to be outdone, Hyundai Motor Co. pulled the wraps off its  
first sport ute: The Santa Fe, a concept vehicle the Korean 
automaker bills as the ``big little SUV,'' complete with the 
removal picnic table. 
</P>
<P>
	The renewed interest in station wagons as SUV/minivan wannabes  
also was evident. General Motors Corp.'s Saab unit announced it was 
reentering the station wagon segment with its 9-5, which the 
Swedish automaker plans to market as a sporty alternative to bigger 
minivans or SUVs. 
</P>
<P>
	And Subaru, the Japanese automaker that re-established itself in  
the United States by marketing wagons and cars as ``hybrid utility 
vehicles'' with all-wheel-drive and SUV-like cladding, unveiled the 
redesigned Outback wagon and sedan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford wouldn't speculate when the ``my'' could reach showrooms,  
saying that would depend on reaction to its features, such as rear 
doors that open toward the back and four bucket seats -- the rear 
two able to fold down for an expanded cargo area. 
</P>
<P>
	A mouse-like ball controls instrumentation of the vehicle, which  
has a six-cylinder engine and all-wheel drive. It also has a global 
positioning system, and even a roof of amber glass and similarly 
tinted windows, which Ford describes as built-in sunglasses for the 
occupants. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's something that sets this vehicle apart,'' said J  
Mays, Ford's design chief. ``It gives passengers in 'my' an 
open-air feeling without being exposed to the elements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai plans to turn the Santa Fe into a production model that  
will reach U.S. showrooms in late spring 2000 as a compact SUV with 
four- or six-cylinder engines and two- or all-wheel drive. It bears 
style cues from the Tiburon coupe and Sonata sedan, and shares many 
of the Sonata's major parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai expects the Santa Fe to compete with Honda's popular  
CR-V and Toyota's RAV4 and be priced under $20,000 fully equipped. 
Hyundai anticipates selling 20,000 to 25,000 Santa Fes next year, 
targeting buyers ages 18 to 34. 
</P>
<P>
	Swedish automaker Saab expects to begin production of its 9-5  
wagon in May. It was displayed with two mountain bikes strapped to 
its luggage rack. 
</P>
<P>
	The wedge-shaped wagon features a turbocharged engine and an  
illuminated cargo area with a foldable shelf and slide-out floor. 
Saab expects the 9-5 to fetch $35,000 to $40,000 for each of the 
4,000 vehicles the company expects to sell in its first year in 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a cargo standpoint, it offers more than an SUV or  
minivan,'' said Joel Manby, SAAB Cars USA Inc.'s president, adding 
the target consumer could include ``housewives who want to get out 
of that minivan image.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other unveilings Tuesday included:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The Lexus I.S., a small sports sedan it plans to begin selling  
here in summer 2000. The North American version of the I.S. -- it 
will have a different name when it goes on sale here -- will differ 
little from the version already on sale in Japan and Europe. It 
will have a V6 powering the rear wheels, and compete with the BMW 
3-series and Audi A4 sport sedans. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Mazda's concept version of its next-generation minivan that it  
plans to produce later this year. The redesigned MPV is about the 
same size as the old version that Mazda stopped selling last year, 
but Mazda says it's designed to be lighter and more nimble than its 
predecessor and competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The MPV will come with a 170-horsepower V6 and seating for  
eight. The rear seats fold into the floorboard and can be flipped 
over 90 degrees for tailgating. Prices were not announced.

<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- An explosion in an unused locker sent  
smoke throughout a high school and injured 11 students shortly 
after lunch Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the students who were hurt at Northeast High School  
suffered minor injuries, like cuts and neck pain, police spokesman 
Russ Dykstra said. The school was evacuated and the 1,100 students 
were bused home. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosive device went off in a first-floor locker that was  
not assigned to a student. It damaged a bank of 13 lockers and left 
a 1-foot-square hole in the ceiling, Fire Department spokesman Brad 
Humston said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt like a small explosion, and then a bigger one,'' said  
James Harrison, a program administrator at the school. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials said the device was ammonia-based, but police  
were investigating. Bomb-sniffing dogs were searching the building. 
</P>
<P>
	Classes were scheduled as usual for Wednesday, but principal  
Stephen Brown said he would ask for additional security staff and 
an additional metal detector for one of the doors.

<HEADLINE> Ford Workers Pressure Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Nearly 3,000 workers at the Brazilian  
subsidiary of Ford Motor Co. ignored their pink slips and showed up 
for work on Tuesday to force the company to reconsider their 
dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 2,800 dismissed workers, together with the 3,700 who were  
not fired donned their overalls and peacefully entered the 
factory,'' shop steward Joao Rodrigues de Sousa told reporters. 
``However, they were unable to work because the company did not 
activate the assembly line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to show the company that we want to work and that it  
should discuss with us alternatives to the dismissals,'' Sousa 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's press office said the company would have no comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The Metalworkers Union in Sao Bernardo do Campo, the Sao Paulo  
industrial suburb where Ford's plant is located, said the 
alternatives could include a shorter work week, wage cuts and lower 
production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sousa criticized Ford for ``not making any effort at all to  
discuss ways to avoid the dismissal of workers who have nowhere 
else to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He cited the example of the local subsidiary of Volkswagen -- the  
country's largest automaker -- that recently averted the dismissal 
of close to 8,000 workers by reducing wages and the work week. 
</P>
<P>
	The company announced the dismissals on Dec. 18, saying they  
were necessary because of a ``drop in demand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They (the layoffs) are the only way to guarantee the continued  
viability of the organization,'' Ford said in a note distributed at 
the time. ``Sales have dropped 40 percent since the Asian crisis 
erupted in 1997 and no significant recovery is expected for the 
near future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's auto industry has seen sales plummet since the first  
effects of financial turmoil in Asia reached the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The hefty hikes in interest rates to protect the economy from  
currency speculators had a major impact in a market where nearly 70 
percent of auto sales are made on credit. After hitting a high of 
49.75 percent in September, interest rates were gradually lowered 
to their current level of about 29 percent a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest figures compiled by the National Association of  
Vehicle Manufacturers show that sales plunged 29 percent in the 
first 11 months of 1998 compared to the same period the previous 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Inventories of unsold cars today stand at some 200,000 vehicles  
parked in factory yards and on dealers' lots.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Follow Dollar Lower / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bond prices fell Tuesday as the dollar  
weakened against the Japanese yen and as U.S. stock prices 
continued to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 29-32  
point, or $9.06 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to 5.20 percent from 5.15 percent late 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds were hurt by the eroding value of the dollar, which  
dropped to its lowest level in more than two years against the yen. 
If the dollar continues to decline, dollar-denominated bonds become 
less attractive to foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the Dow Jones industrial average shot up 126.92  
points Tuesday and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index and Nasdaq 
composite index both hit new highs. A rising stock market competes 
with bonds for investors' dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were down between 1/8 and 3/16 point, and intermediate maturities 
were off 1/4 point to 15-32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 3.01 
points to 1,315.82. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.47 percent as the  
discount fell 0.01 point from auction Monday to 4.37 percent. 
Six-month yields were 4.56 percent, as the discount fell 0.01 point 
from the auction to 4.41 percent. One-year yields were 4.54 percent 
as the discount fell 0.03 point from late Monday to 4.35 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.50 percent from 5.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell to 124 7/16 from 124 23-32. The average 
yield to maturity rose to 5.18 percent from 5.17 percent.

<HEADLINE> Apple's iMac Sports 4 New Colors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Apple Computer Inc. intensified is  
challenge to conventional computer design Tuesday by unveiling four 
bright new colors for its popular iMac desktop machine. 
</P>
<P>
	The iMac is now available in red, orange, purple, and green as  
well as its original color, teal. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Jobs, Apple's interim chief executive, announced the new  
colors at the annual MacWorld show. He also revealed a $100 cut in 
the $1,300 price of the computer. 
</P>
<P>
	The variety of colors will make the iMac's unusual translucent  
case, through which the inner circuitry is faintly visible, stand 
out even more than before on the shelves of computer stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that people want to collect all five,'' Jobs joked, to  
the applause and whoops of thousands of Apple Macintosh fans at the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	Most personal computers are sold in beige or sometimes black,  
but the recent popularity of the iMac could prod other 
manufacturers to break with the design convention. 
</P>
<P>
	The iMac was the No. 1 selling PC at retail last November. Apple  
has old 800,000 since it was introduced on Aug. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the unique design, the computer also features  
simplified ways to hook up related gear and Internet connections. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, Jobs unveiled a raft of new computer features and  
software designed to help the company sustain its recovery from 
nearly two years of losses, brought on by the defection of Mac 
users to computers running the Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, one new device enables Mac users to play about 100  
different software games designed for Sony's PlayStation video game 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Jobs said the company would report its fifth consecutive  
quarterly profit next Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Vols Get Three National Trophies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Tennessee will need a showcase for the three  
national championship trophies it was presented after winning the 
Fiesta Bowl. And somewhere next to the glistening hardware will be 
a walking stick. 
</P>
<P>
	The stick earned a place in Tennessee football lore, its status  
guaranteed by Monday night's 23-16 victory over Florida State for 
the national title. 
</P>
<P>
	The stick, a gift from a friend of coach Philip Fulmer, was a  
motivational prop Fulmer first used at midseason. He took it to 
practice and told the players, jokingly, that if they didn't 
motivate themselves, he'd just have to use it on them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next thing I know, the kids are calling me Moses,'' Fulmer  
said Tuesday at a press conference where he accepted national 
championship trophies from The Associated Press, the Football 
Writers Association of America and the USA Today-ESPN Coaches poll. 
</P>
<P>
	``I grabbed a hold of that. We had a meeting the next day about  
energy, synergy and focus,'' Fulmer said. ``I put them in a circle 
and got in the middle with the stick. They passed it around. It was 
just a way of getting them back into focus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The players accepted it in the spirit he intended, Fulmer said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know how corny they would think it was, but the kids  
bought into it. That was the main thing. They wanted to be around 
that stick. They carried it to meetings and practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll have to retire that thing right next to the trophies, I  
guess. The Synergy Stick. Other than being called Moses, I thought 
it was a great idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's but one of the memories Fulmer said he carries from the  
Volunteers' unlikely title season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember that field goal against Syracuse, the wide field  
goal against Florida, the play of our offensive line and running 
backs to get it down the field and win against Arkansas,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a mental snapshot of Tee Martin's face as he came off  
the field last night, the incredible elation and pride in that. The 
look in my wife's eyes. The sacrifice and commitment my family has 
made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee claimed the first national title decided under the  
Bowl Championship Series format, but if the milestone was historic, 
the game was not. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles were playing for the first time in 44 days, while  
the Vols had been off since winning the SEC championship game on 
Dec. 5. Both teams showed the effects of the layoff. There were 
seven turnovers and 21 penalties for 165 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the play, obviously, was sloppy,'' Fulmer said. ``We  
had played a championship game, at least, and they had been off two 
weeks before that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State coach Bobby Bowden agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can't remember us playing in a bowl where we looked this  
futile,'' he said after his bowl record dropped to 16-5-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State (11-2) finished No. 3 in the final Associated  
Press poll, the 12th straight year the Seminoles have finished in 
the top four. Ohio State (11-1) was No. 2 behind the Volunteers 
(13-0), who completed their best season in 102 years of college 
football. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that Fulmer has reached the national championship level, he  
knows he'll be asked to do it again. 
</P>
<P>
	Fulmer said the impact of the victory probably hasn't hit him  
yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the expectations will be high at Tennessee. They always  
are,'' he said. ``It wasn't 10 minutes after the game that somebody 
asked me about the redshirt freshmen on our team. I thought, `Let 
us enjoy this at least this evening.''' 
</P>
<P>
	But, Fulmer said, raising expectations was what he set out to do  
when he took the job six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to be in the mix of teams known as the best in the  
country,'' he said. ``I think this puts us up there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Up there is right, up there with the royalty of the college  
football world where fancy trophies live. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's trophies have ``Tennessee'' on them.  
</P>
<P>
	And a stick for company.

<P>
	Two new categories have been added this year to acknowledge the  
growth of dance music in the pop world. Awards for best dance 
recording and re-mixer of the year were added, along with a Latin 
alternative rock album award, bringing to 92 the number of Grammys 
that will be presented. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards will be presented Feb. 24 at the Shrine Auditorium in  
Los Angeles during a three-hour ceremony to be telecast live on 
CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	The show originated in New York the past two years, and Michael  
Greene, president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and 
Sciences, has said the awards will return to that city. 
</P>
<P>
	But Los Angeles officials are lobbying to have the 2000 show  
held in the Staples Center, which is under construction downtown 
and scheduled to open this fall.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two Democrats from California's delegation  
will miss the House swearing-in ceremony when the 106th Congress 
opens on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. George Miller will take the oath of office for his 13th  
two-year term in a ceremony Thursday at his home in Martinez, 
Calif., his office said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller had hip replacement surgery on Dec. 2 and doctors have  
advised against travel for up to eight weeks to ensure a complete 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Miller was the only member to miss the historic  
House votes Dec. 19 to impeach President Clinton. Miller, an 
impeachment opponent, canceled plans to fly to Washington after it 
became clear that his votes wouldn't change outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Rep. Sam Farr, who is recovering from a broken ankle  
suffered during a fall on ice just before Christmas, will begin his 
fourth term when he is sworn in during a ceremony at his boyhood 
home in Carmel, Calif., an aide said. 
</P>
<P>
	In both cases, a California judge will administer the oath just  
as the House Speaker would if both members were present in 
Washington.

<HEADLINE> Actor Iron Eyes Cody Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- His acting credits date to the silent movie  
era and include dozens of films, but Iron Eyes Cody created his 
most enduring role with a single tear in a television commercial. 
</P>
<P>
	Cody, who was in his 80s or 90s, died of natural causes Monday  
at his home in Los Angeles, police spokesman Ed Funes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cody was best known as the ``Crying Indian'' in the Keep America  
Beautiful ads that showed him mourning -- and shedding a single tear 
-- at the sight of a pristine landscape fouled by litter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was more than advertising,'' said Roger Powers, who was  
president of the group in 1970, when a California advertising 
agency discovered Cody. ``What we found -- it was a stroke of luck -- 
was a man who lived it and believed in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cody filmed three more public service announcements and spent  
the next 25 years making public appearances and visits to schools 
on behalf of the movement, Powers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cody was born in Oklahoma, but the exact date of birth wasn't  
known. Reference books give various dates, from 1904 to 1915. Based 
on his credits, his most likely date of birth was 1907. 
</P>
<P>
	Cody followed his Cherokee Indian father, Thomas Long Plume, as  
a performer in circuses and Wild West shows and made his first film 
appearance as an extra in the 1919 silent ``Back to God's 
Country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cody went on to appear in more than 80 films in American Indian  
roles; often his character was listed as simply ``Indian,'' 
``Indian Chief'' or ``Indian Joe.'' In one film, ``Perils of 
Nyoka'' in 1942, he had an uncredited role as ``Arab.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His credits included ``Sitting Bull'' in 1954, ``The Great Sioux  
Massacre'' in 1965, ``Nevada Smith'' in 1966, ``A Man Called 
Horse'' in 1970 and ``Ernest Goes to Camp'' in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Cody also served as a technical adviser on Indian matters in  
films. In television, he had guest appearances on ``Bonanza,'' 
``Gunsmoke'' and ``Rawhide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cody's wife died in 1978. He is survived by a son; three  
grandchildren; and a niece.

<HEADLINE> Judge Warns Del. Murder Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- A judge warned murder defendant Thomas  
Capano of possible ``Draconian sanctions'' today, saying Capano was 
trying to manipulate the prosecution by responding to questions 
with questions. 
</P>
<P>
	The warning came a day after Capano, a one-time state deputy  
attorney general, called the prosecutor a ``heartless, gutless, 
soulless disgrace for a human being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capano, 49, is accused of killing Anne Marie Fahey, the  
governor's scheduling secretary, in June 1996 because she wanted to 
end their affair. 
</P>
<P>
	After originally saying he didn't know what happened to Ms.  
Fahey, Capano now claims another mistress, Deborah MacIntyre, 
accidentally shot her. He says he put Ms. Fahey's body in a cooler 
and dumped it at sea. Ms. MacIntyre denies even being at Capano's 
house that night. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge William Swain Lee didn't describe the potential sanctions  
as he spoke to Capano before the jury entered the courtroom this 
morning, but he said they could be ``Draconian.'' Lee also refused 
to let Capano apologize to the jury for outbursts Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are to stop trying to manipulate the state's questions  
with your own questions to serve your purposes,'' Lee said. ``Do we 
understand each other?'' 
</P>
<P>
	During cross-examination, Capano repeatedly turned the  
prosecutor's questions around to ask his own questions. For 
example, when asked about how Capano tried to protect his 
daughters, Capano asked Assistant U.S. Attorney Colm Connolly about 
what investigators did to Capano's daughters and mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano, who was in his eighth day on the stand today, looked  
down and remained sullen after the judge issued his warning. This 
afternoon, he was being questioned by his own lawyer after Connolly 
completed four days of cross-examination. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, he blew up when Connolly suggested he tried to use  
his daughters to protect himself from the murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``You heartless, gutless, soulless disgrace for a human being,''  
he hissed. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge ordered bailiffs to take Capano from the courtroom  
Monday and recessed the trial for the day. Capano shouted ``liar'' 
at Connolly as he was led out. 
</P>
<P>
	The outburst came as Connolly recalled the times Capano tried to  
use others -- including his brothers and Ms. MacIntyre -- to protect 
himself from prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	When Connolly suggested Capano could have protected his  
daughters from being interviewed by cooperating with authorities, 
the defendant accused Connolly of ``tormenting'' his family. 
</P>
<P>
	For 2 1/2 years after Ms. Fahey disappeared, Capano maintained he  
took her home after dinner and never saw her again. He testified 
Monday that he didn't come forward with his story of the accidental 
shooting until his trial got under way because the federal 
government became involved in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after Ms. Fahey disappeared, President Clinton called Gov.  
Thomas Carper to offer his condolences and any assistance. Carper 
accepted the offer, and a federal investigation began. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president of the United States gets involved and I'm  
diving as deep as I can,'' Capano said, trying to explain his 
reticence. ``Look at what happened afterward. Look what you've 
done. I knew I couldn't trust you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capano suggested that when federal agents raided his brother's  
house in October 1997, they ``set him up'' on a cocaine charge. 
Gerard Capano became a prosecution witness, testifying that he 
helped his brother get rid of a body from his boat. 
</P>
<P>
	Connolly suggested that Capano had not made up his mind about  
the ``accident'' defense until just two days before it was raised 
publicly in his lawyer's opening statements in late October.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Not Reinventing Himself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson isn't reinventing himself for his  
first fight since biting Evander Holyfield's ears. 
</P>
<P>
	He said what fight fans will see Jan. 16 against Francois Botha  
is the old Tyson -- but with a few twists. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll fight basically the same,'' Tyson said. ``It will just be  
with more life and enthusiasm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 19 months since he last fought, Tyson is eager to get  
into the ring in a scheduled 10-round fight in Las Vegas against 
the South African contender. 
</P>
<P>
	But he offered few insights into the fight during a conference  
call Tuesday from his training camp in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm expecting to do very well,'' Tyson said. ``I'm going to  
come right at him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any thoughts that Tyson might try to somehow change his  
wide-open style of fighting in the few weeks he has had under new 
trainer Tommy Brooks were quickly put to rest both by Tyson and 
Brooks, who was in Holyfield's corner for his two wins over Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of trying to change Tyson's style, Brooks said he has  
focused on restoring some of his confidence in his natural 
abilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to get Mike to fight like he did when he won the  
title when he was 20 years old,'' Brooks said. ``He's been making a 
lot of mistakes and we're trying to correct them and get him back 
to that point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson has spent much of his training camp in Phoenix trying to  
do just that, working with Brooks on moving his head as he did 
early in his career to avoid getting hit and using different 
methods to get inside on his opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	In one sparring session just before Christmas, Tyson showed  
flashes of his old form, digging a series of left hooks under the 
ribs of his sparring partner to force the session to a premature 
close. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just working on basic things I've always done,'' Tyson  
said. ``We're trying to focus on them so I can use them more and 
not be hesitant like I was in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's latest return to boxing will be in the same ring where  
he easily disposed of an outclassed Peter McNeeley in his first 
fight since getting out of prison in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	But the latest comeback brings a more reputable opponent in  
Botha -- who briefly held a portion of the heavyweight title -- and 
some additional questions about the state of Tyson's mind following 
two losses to Holyfield and a ban from boxing for biting his ears. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going in there wanting to fight,'' Tyson said in response  
to a question about how much motivation he has left for the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ask Francois Botha after the fight (if the motivation was  
still there).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks said Tyson's physical shape won't be a problem after a  
training camp that has been more intense than some past camps. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in shape to go 10 rounds, but I don't think it will go  
10,'' Brooks said.

<HEADLINE> House Seeks To Ease Ban on Gifts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One of the first actions the new House hopes  
to take this week is easing a three-year-old rule that bars 
lawmakers from accepting any gift, down to the cheapest T-shirt or 
fruit basket. 
</P>
<P>
	The House adopted the gift ban in November 1995 by a 422-6 vote  
with the goal of making a decisive statement to the nation that 
lawmakers are not sullied by favors they receive from special 
interests. But loopholes have created the unintended result that 
they can still accept lavish expenses-paid trips for ``official 
business'' while they must turn down free lunches from 
constituents. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican sources said they are negotiating with Democrats on  
bringing up the gift ban rule when the 106th session of Congress 
convenes on Wednesday. Their plan is to vote to change the rule to 
concur with the less stringent standards imposed on senators. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate rule, adopted in 1995, states that senators can  
accept no gift, including meals, valued at more than $50. There is 
a $100 cap on gifts that can be received from any one source during 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Spurred on by the Senate, House Republican freshmen that year  
joined Democrats in demanding tougher House rules. The GOP 
leadership finally went along, but Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., 
arguing that the Senate rules were too complicated, pushed through 
an amendment banning all gifts, no matter how small. 
</P>
<P>
	But within a year, members were saying the ban was too  
restrictive. Retiring Rules Committee Chairman Gerald Solomon, 
R-N.Y., one of the leaders in writing the standard, said in 1997 
that it ``causes great hardship and embarrassment to members. ... 
It seems to me we ought to have the same rule the Senate has 
because I think it would take away the problems of members 
unintentionally running into questionable areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gift ban also failed to stop other kinds of activities in  
which lawmakers can receive thousands of dollars for their 
participation. Both House and Senate rules allow lawmakers to 
attend conferences, dinners, charity events and other such events, 
and have their expenses paid by the sponsors as long as the 
occasions are connected to the members' official duties. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawmaker can accept a free ticket to a baseball game as long  
as he or she throws out the first ball, and can accept free trips 
to conventions as long as they are for fact-finding purposes or 
some other official function.

<HEADLINE> Two Children Die in Newark Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A couple who left their sleeping daughters  
at home to buy them milk were charged with child endangerment after 
an apartment fire killed both girls. 
</P>
<P>
	Anna D'Almeida, 21, and Antonio Andrade, 27, each face two  
counts of endangering the welfare of a child, and may face 
additional charges, Sgt. Derek Glenn said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple left the girls, 2-year-old Ruth Andrade and her  
nine-month-old sister, Millaya, alone Monday night to go a store 
about five blocks away, Glenn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn said D'Almeida wanted to buy milk for the children, and  
tried to drive the couple's car, a Mitsubishi Eclipse they had just 
bought. But the car has a manual transmission and she had 
difficulty operating the stick shift. 
</P>
<P>
	So she went back upstairs and told Andrade who came down to  
help, leaving the children asleep, Glenn said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He figured he'd go with her and show her how to drive it,''  
Glenn said. ``They figured they'd only be gone a few minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When they returned, the apartment in the three-story building  
was ablaze. Glenn said the fire was started by an electric space 
heater in an adjacent apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	A neighbor, Jose Meneses, said D'Almeida began screaming when  
she saw the flames in her apartment. Then she passed out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's when everyone realized the babies were inside,''  
Meneses said. ``I feel bad because I have a five-month-old baby 
myself. I wish I could have saved them.''

<HEADLINE> FSU's Comeback Bid Falls Short </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Florida State had been doing it all season,  
racking up penalties, starting slow and falling behind early. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite stumbling out of the gate, the Seminoles (ll-2) almost  
always came back to win. They almost did it again Monday night 
against Tennessee (13-0) but fell short to lose the Fiesta Bowl and 
the national championship 23-16. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as we were within one score of them I really thought  
we would probably win it,'' Florida State coach Bobby Bowden said. 
``We've done it all year, come back and win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden said the difference was big plays, especially at the  
quarterback position. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee's Tee Martin hit Peerless Price with two long passes,  
one for 76 yards that set up the Volunteers first touchdown and 
then a 79-yard score that put the Vols ahead 20-9 in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The longest pass completed by Florida State's Marcus Outzen,  
subbing for the injured Chris Weinke, was 39 yards. He completed 
only 9 of 22 passes for 145 yards and threw two interceptions, one 
returned for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reality creeps up on you,'' Florida State coach Bobby Bowden  
said Tuesday. ``The quarterback starting his third game, reality 
begins to hit you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The game was reminiscent of Florida State's only other loss,  
24-7 to North Carolina State. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinke made only his second career start in that game in place  
of Dan Kendra, also injured. Weinke threw a school record six 
interceptions and the Wolfpack's Torry Holt scorched the Seminoles 
much like Price did -- including a 63-yard pass reception and a 
68-yard punt return. 
</P>
<P>
	One difference, though, was Florida State was in the game  
against Tennessee until the last minutes. The Seminoles closed the 
gap to one touchdown but missed chances to score again when an 
onside kick failed and a pass was intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State was behind or tied at the half, as they were  
against Tennessee, in four prior games and won three. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden said the 110 penalty yards Florida State accumulated was  
an overrated statistic and noted that the Seminoles had been 
flagged for similar yardage all season. He said it was a sign of 
aggressiveness, but two roughing penalties cost the Seminoles 
points Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first quarter, an FSU punt return deep into Tennessee  
territory was nullified by a roughing call. Later, the Seminoles 
roughed Tennessee's kicker on a field goal attempt and the Vols 
went on to score a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first punt was kind of an indication of the way this thing  
was going to work out -- you are going to self destruct,'' Bowden 
said. ``Our season was kind of that way. I thought we were the 
better team and would eventually pull it out, we just never did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time in three years Florida State, which won a  
national title in 1993, has lost the championship in a bowl game. 
Two years ago, Florida won the championship handing the then 
top-ranked Seminoles their only loss in the Sugar Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State was No. 2 going into the Fiesta Bowl and dropped  
to third behind Tennessee and Ohio State after losing to the Vols. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, we're losing to those guys, but we're losing to the No.  
1 team in the nation, and we're losing to the No. 2 team,'' Bowden 
said. ``At least we're getting to the dadgum dance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden expects to be dancing again next season when most of his  
young team returns. 
</P>
<P>
	``This wasn't supposed to be a peak year.'' Bowden said. ``We  
were a team of potential and we nearly pulled it off. Next year we 
are a team of experienced potential.''

<HEADLINE> Cadence Boosts Bid for Quickturn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP)-- Cadence Design Systems Inc. on Tuesday boosted  
its bid to $271.3 million, or $15 a share, for Quickturn Design 
Systems Inc. in an effort to sway shareholders away from a hostile 
takeover attempt by Mentor Graphics. 
</P>
<P>
	Cadence, which raised its white-knight offer of $14 a share,  
also cautioned Quickturn shareholders not to oust the Quickturn 
board on Friday when the company holds a special meeting demanded 
by Mentor. 
</P>
<P>
	Mentor Graphics, which last week increased its offer to $14 a  
share, has been fighting for control of Quickturn since August. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Mentor Graphics and Cadence make software that engineers  
use to design computer chips, while Quickturn specializes on 
hardware and software that lets companies test the performance of 
chip designs before putting them into finished products. 
</P>
<P>
	Quickturn's stock rose 76 5/8 cents to $15.06 1/4 on the Nasdaq Stock  
Market. Mentor Graphics' shares slipped 28 1/8 cents to $8.06 1/4, also 
on the Nasdaq. Cadence's shares dipped 37 1/2 cents to close at 
$29.68 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> GOP Nominates Hastert As Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican lawmakers nominated Rep. Dennis  
Hastert on Tuesday to be the next House speaker, and he immediately 
extended an olive branch to Democrats in a capital beset by 
partisan bitterness. 
</P>
<P>
	The 57-year-old former high school wrestling coach was nominated  
by unanimous vote by his GOP colleagues during a closed-door 
meeting on the House floor. Hastert would officially become speaker 
Wednesday, when the 106th Congress convenes and the full House 
elects him to the post. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to meet the Democratic leadership and Democratic  
caucus halfway, and I expect them to come halfway and meet me,'' 
the Illinois Republican told reporters immediately after the GOP 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert offered no specifics about where he would seek  
cooperation with Democrats. But acknowledging the thin majority his 
party will have, he said, ``We need to make the effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert faces the task of pushing legislation through a House  
the GOP will control with a slim 11-seat majority -- and amid 
intense partisan animosity fanned by the impeachment of President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert's call for cooperation underlined GOP concerns that the  
party be seen as striving to find solutions to problems, rather 
than one that is consumed by political bickering and attacks on the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet despite his soothing words, few expect bipartisan  
cooperation to be a hallmark of the new Congress. Besides the harsh 
feelings stirred by impeachment, the 2000 presidential elections 
and the controversy surrounding upcoming issues like Social 
Security and tax cuts make clashes likely. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Hastert acknowledged that Republicans would have to  
pull together often. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can come from all edges and work together to get a product  
done, the job done, that the American people want us to do,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert's comments reflected the disagreements that rage between  
conservative and moderate Republicans over subjects such as the 
budget and abortion that have at times blocked legislative 
achievement. Many Republicans consider the low-key Hastert, a 
conservative who has thrived as a behind-the-scenes consensus 
builder, well-suited for the role of healer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's clearly a division within the conference between  
moderates and the right, and he can bridge that better than 
anyone,'' said Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., who was ousted from a House 
GOP leadership job last November after his party suffered Election 
Day losses. 
</P>
<P>
	In a response he has relied on often, Hastert described the many  
``talented people'' among House Republicans when he was asked about 
details of GOP tax-cut plans. The comment spotlighted his desire to 
let committee chairmen and others play more assertive roles than 
they did under the more forceful former Speaker Newt Gingrich, 
R-Ga., who resigned, effective last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Gingrich, Hastert is uncomfortable before television  
cameras, and has already decided to not appear on any Sunday 
television news shows until after Clinton's State of the Union 
address, now set for Jan. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	About to begin his seventh two-year term, Hastert informally  
became speaker-in-waiting on Dec. 19. That is the day 
Speaker-designate Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., announced he would 
resign from Congress after admitting to extramarital relationships, 
which he did after learning that Hustler magazine publisher Larry 
Flynt was investigating his affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	A month earlier, Republicans had elected Livingston to replace  
Gingrich, blamed by many GOP lawmakers for the party's loss of five 
House seats in the Nov. 3 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the Republican agenda, Hastert has already said he wants  
the House to concentrate on revamping Social Security and Medicare, 
boosting schools and defense, and tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	At a reception Tuesday evening, Hastert told reporters he  
planned to meet Wednesday with House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, 
D-Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have already had to rebuff charges by Democrats that  
Hastert may do little more than follow orders from House Whip Tom 
DeLay, R-Texas, the hard-charging No. 3 House leader to whom 
Hastert has been deputy until now. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not a yes man, he's not in my shadow,'' DeLay told  
reporters.

<HEADLINE> Episcopal Bishops Settle Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A conservative Episcopal faction that used  
the church's name to promote its agenda on the Internet has agreed 
to stop the practice after a lawsuit was filed by liberal bishops. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a deal approved Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Maryanne  
Trump Barry, Bishop William C. Wantland of Wisconsin agreed to stop 
using the name of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United 
States of America -- and its acronym -- in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, the New Jersey bishops agreed to drop claims for  
damages. The settlement is not binding on use of the name in other 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	Wantland's conservative faction had used the church name for a  
Wisconsin corporation, and its initials for a Web site that opposes 
liberal positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Wantland opposes the ordination of women and homosexuals as  
priests. He was among 10 bishops who failed in an attempt to 
excommunicate a retired bishop, Walter Righter, for ordaining the 
Rev. Barry Stopfel, a gay man who became rector of a church in 
Maplewood. 
</P>
<P>
	The Episcopal Church allowed women to be ordained beginning in  
the 1970s; it became mandatory in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop John Spong of Newark sued last January to stop Wantland  
from using the name, contending it could cause confusion. Spong's 
diocese in 1996 approved a standard liturgy for blessing same-sex 
marriages, and the bishop supports the ordination of homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	The national church organization, based in New York City,  
represents about 2.5 million Episcopalians in the United States.

<HEADLINE> CBS Replacing ABC on AOL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS struck a deal Tuesday to replace ABC as the  
exclusive broadcast news provider for America Online. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS News will provide text, audio and video to AOL, the world's  
largest online service, and its affiliated CompuServe service. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial terms were not disclosed. The companies said only  
that it is a multiyear agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is a huge boost for CBS as it tries to catch up with  
news organizations such as NBC, CNN and ABC that are more 
established on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL will continue to offer news from a variety of other media,  
such as The New York Times, Newsweek and Business Week magazines 
and wire services including The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	But CBS will be the only broadcaster on AOL, which has 14  
million members worldwide. CompuServe adds 2 million members. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the vast amount of traffic AOL gets, this definitely  
puts CBS on the map,'' said Mark Mooradian, a senior analyst at 
Internet research firm Jupiter Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC had been the exclusive broadcast news provider to AOL since  
1997. Michelle Bergman, a spokeswoman for ABCNews.com, would not 
comment on whether it tried to renegotiate with AOL. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Pittman, AOL president, said the deal does not reflect  
dissatisfaction with ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported Tuesday that an executive involved  
in the AOL-CBS negotiations said AOL was concerned about the 
competitive Internet investments being made by ABC's parent, Walt 
Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors welcomed the news about CBS. In late morning trading,  
CBS climbed 62.5 cents to $32.50 a share on the New York Stock 
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Holmes, Foreman Fight May Happen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The fight between old-timers George Foreman and  
Larry Holmes might still happen yet. 
</P>
<P>
	But promoter Roger Levitt says it will take place only if  
Foreman agrees to a different form of payment. 
</P>
<P>
	The bout between the aging former heavyweight champions is  
scheduled for Jan. 23 at the Houston Astrodome. But Foreman's camp 
contends the bout is off because the promoter has not met his 
financial obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The promoter had a deadline to meet and it was missed,''  
Foreman lawyer Steve Katleman told Houston TV station KRIV. ``An 
extension was granted to provide a letter of credit and we had 
every expectation it would be taken care of. It didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have told Roger Levitt there will be no further extensions.  
The fight is not going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt said Monday he has secured an insurance bond that will  
guarantee Foreman the remaining $9 million of his $10 million 
purse. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes is owed $3.6 million of his $4 million share, and Levitt  
said the fighter will be paid. 
</P>
<P>
	``If George Foreman wants to fight, then it will happen,'' said  
Russ Sauer, Holmes' lawyer. ``If Mr. Foreman agrees to proceed with 
the financial agreement in place, I don't see any problems working 
out an alternative arrangement for Larry in which he'll be 
guaranteed his money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman was expecting a letter of credit, which also guarantees  
the fighters to receive their entire purse. But two financial 
backers pulled out in recent weeks, putting the bout in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes doesn't appear too concerned by the roadblocks,  
especially since he has waited nearly five years to get Foreman in 
the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't mind giving him (Levitt) the benefit of the doubt,''  
Holmes said. ``Especially since he has spent a lot of money 
already.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt has already given Foreman $1 million and Holmes $400,000  
-- both of which are nonrefundable. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight has been called The ``Battle of the Aged.'' Foreman  
will be 50 by the time of the bout and Holmes is 49. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as we're concerned, the fight is still on and was never  
off,'' Levitt said. ``George has now got exactly what he needs. Now 
all he needs to do is get in the ring and fight. ``He has no moral 
or legal way out. We've met the demands of the contract with no 
exclusions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt is planning a Wednesday news conference in New York to  
present the insurance bond and clear up speculation surrounding the 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes last fought in July 1997, when he won a decision over  
Maurice Harris. His career record is 66-6 with 42 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman's record is 76-5 with 68 knockouts, including a loss in  
his last fight to Shannon Briggs in November 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The bout will be carried on pay-per-view for $39.95.

<HEADLINE> FDA OKs Bladder Device for Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The first implant to help restore bladder  
function to Americans with spinal cord injuries received Food and 
Drug Administration approval Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A severe consequence of paralyzing spinal cord injuries is loss  
of bladder control. Patients become dependent on catheters or other 
hard-to-use equipment to void their bladders and may be prone to 
bladder accidents. They're also vulnerable to repeated urinary 
tract infections. 
</P>
<P>
	NeuroControl Corp.'s Vocare Bladder System is a pacemaker-style  
stimulator surgically implanted under the skin of the abdomen. 
Electrodes send signals to the spinal nerves that lead to the 
bladder, causing it to contract and then relax. Patients switch on 
the device with an external controller whenever they want to empty 
the bladder. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA approved Vocare under a special provision that speeds  
new technologies to patients with rare, hard-to-treat diseases. 
Under that provision, NeuroControl had to study just 23 Americans 
to demonstrate Vocare's benefit. Six months after the implant, 11 
of those patients had enough bladder function restored that they 
did not need additional bladder-control help, said FDA's Dr. Daniel 
Schultz, who oversees urology devices. Also, patients experienced 
78 percent fewer urinary tract infections. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA decided the device was safe enough to sell based on data  
from over 1,000 patients in Europe, where it has been sold for 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
	But Vocare does pose some problems: Surgery is risky for spinal  
cord patients, half of whom experienced some type surgical 
complication during the U.S. study. Also, Vocare side effects may 
include temporary nerve damage or problems with bowel function such 
as constipation, Schultz said.

<HEADLINE> George Brett Goes to Cooperstown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A television camera roving the crowd at  
Fenway Park during the 1967 World Series happened upon an excited 
14-year-old with a wide grin and a fabulous destiny. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hello, I'm Ken Brett's little brother, George,'' America heard  
him say. 
</P>
<P>
	And now -- 31 years, 3,154 hits, three batting titles, two World  
Series appearances and one notorious wad of pine tar later -- Ken 
Brett's little brother is saying hello again -- to Cooperstown. 
</P>
<P>
	``George Brett clearly deserves a special place in the annals of  
major league baseball history,'' said American League president 
Gene Budig, a close friend. ``Very few were as gifted and tenacious 
as George.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was elected to the Hall of Fame on Tuesday with Nolan Ryan  
and Robin Yount. Brett, 13th on the career hits list with 3,154, 
made it with 98.19 percent of the vote, the fourth-highest total 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was flabbergasted,'' Brett said of his vote total. ``It just  
knocked me on the floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The best player in the history of the Kansas City Royals was not  
even supposed to be the best in his family. That distinction 
belonged to Ken, five years older and a can't-miss prospect with a 
dominating fastball when the Red Sox brought him up in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ken's little brother was an instant success after the Royals  
elevated him to stay in 1974 as a wide-ranging third baseman who 
threw right and batted left. A devoted student of hitting coach 
Charlie Lau, he batted .333 in 1976 to win his first batting title 
and begin a string of 13 straight All-Star appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	When he retired after the 1993 season, he had a .305 lifetime  
average and, reflecting his uncanny knack for rising to the 
occasion, a .337 postseason mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would get out there and work so long and hard, he had  
blisters on his hands,'' said Denny Matthews, the Royals' radio 
voice since 1969. ``He would be out there at 2:30 in the afternoon 
working in the hot sun. Then he'd go 3-for-4 and people would say, 
`Gee, what a natural hitter.''' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the great clutch hitters of his era, Brett's statistics  
over 20-plus years, all with the Royals, project an elegant 
symmetry with more than 5,000 total bases, 3,000 hits, 1,500 runs, 
1,500 RBIs, 1,000 extra-base hits, 600 doubles, 300 home runs, 200 
stolen bases and 100 triples. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hard work and mental toughness are what made George Brett  
great,'' Royals general manager Herk Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the history of major-league baseball, no other man had 3,000  
hits, 300 home runs, 600 doubles and 100 triples while also 
stealing 200 bases. Besides Brett, only Hank Aaron, Stan Musial, 
Willie Mays, Carl Yastrzemski, Al Kaline, Eddie Murray and Dave 
Winfield combined 300 homers with 3,000 hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Pete Rose is the only player with more doubles than Brett's 665  
who's not in the Hall of Fame. And Aaron and Mays are the only 
others with 3,000 hits, 300 home runs and 200 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett stands alone as the only man to win batting titles in  
three decades ('76, '80, '90). And his .390 average in 1980 -- just 
five hits shy of .400 -- is the highest in the majors in 57 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``He stands as an icon in Kansas City and throughout the Midwest  
where there is a legion of Royals fans,'' Budig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett's most brilliant year and game may have come in 1985 when  
he won his first Gold Glove, finished second in the batting race 
with a .335 average, led the league with a club-record .585 
slugging percentage and came within two intentional walks of tying 
Ted Williams' AL record. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, after the Royals fell behind Toronto two games to none in  
the seven-game playoffs, Brett kept his team alive in game three 
with two home runs, a double, a single and a spectacular defensive 
play as the Royals rallied 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the most amazing game for any position player I've  
ever seen,'' Matthews said. ``George simply willed the Royals to 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His most famous game was on a July afternoon in Yankee Stadium  
in 1983 when New York manager Billy Martin howled that the bat he'd 
just used to hit a go-ahead home run off Rich Gossage had pine tar 
too far up the handle. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires called him out. But later, AL president Lee MacPhail  
upheld the Royals' protest. When he's inducted into the Hall of 
Fame this summer, the pine tar bat will be there waiting for him.

<HEADLINE> Employee Health Costs Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- At General Motors, executives are watching more  
than the latest car models role off the assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
	The giant automaker is also watching the acceleration in  
employee health benefit costs. ``It's worrisome,'' said Bruce 
Bradley, GM's director of managed care plans. 
</P>
<P>
	GM isn't the only company eyeing this issue. Large-employers'  
health benefit costs are increasing an average of 7 percent this 
year, almost twice the rate of 1998, according to the results of a 
national survey being released today by the consulting firm Towers 
Perrin. 
</P>
<P>
	While still a far cry from the 14 percent to 18 percent  
increases in the beginning of the decade, the acceleration in costs 
marks the biggest jump since 1993, the year President Clinton made 
his ill-fated national health reform proposal 
</P>
<P>
	``Our findings suggest the easy savings offered by managed care  
may already be behind us,'' said William J. Falk, a principal in 
Towers Perrin's Chicago office. 
</P>
<P>
	HMOs have increased premiums lately to rebuild profits. They've  
cited rising prescription drug prices and the decline in federal 
fees from the Medicare insurance program for the elderly to justify 
the rate hikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of plans, in fact, quit offering health insurance to  
Medicare enrollees this month because they did not believe they 
could profit with the government's reimbursement rate. 
</P>
<P>
	That's creating headaches for those employers that offer health  
benefits to retirees. Some had shifted retirees into HMOs from 
Medicare supplement policies to take advantage of the low or no 
premiums for Medicare HMO coverage in the large retiree markets of 
South Florida and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	While fewer employers provide health insurance coverage to  
retirees, about one-third still offer the benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	Though traditional health insurance and HMO premiums are now  
rising at the same rate, HMOs still are generally 20 percent 
cheaper. And HMOs offer more benefits, including coverage for 
prescription drugs and few, if any, deductibles. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Falk said he expects most employers will stick with  
HMOs and other forms of managed care. ``It still is an attractive 
alternative,'' he said 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 207 employers, primarily large Fortune 100 companies,  
took part in the Towers Perrin survey, which was conducted by mail 
in November. 
</P>
<P>
	A study released this week by Buck Consultants found corporate  
health-benefit costs increasing by 5.6 percent for HMOs, 12.6 
percent for traditional insurance coverage and 9.8 percent for 
preferred-provider plans, a type of managed health care that is 
less restrictive than HMOs. Buck, a New York consulting firm, 
surveyed 25 health insurers.

<HEADLINE>  New Speaker Promises To Get To Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Dennis Hastert says his main goal when he  
is chosen speaker of the House is to end the political divisions 
that have held legislation hostage, and thereby restore the 
nation's faith in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Congress has to go to work, we have to start to produce  
good things that the American people want, policy that addresses 
the needs of the American people,'' the Illinois Republican said 
before a meeting with GOP leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's our first and most important step in restoring faith in  
this U.S. House of Representatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans will meet late today to choose Hastert, a  
little-known six-term lawmaker, to succeed Newt Gingrich as their 
leader. On Wednesday he is to be formally elected speaker with the 
convening of the 106th session of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert's surprise rise to the leadership spot followed  
Gingrich's decision to resign in the wake of Republican losses in 
the November elections and the announcement last month by 
Gingrich's expected successor, Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., that he 
had had extramarital affairs and would not seek the speakership. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert takes over a House deeply divided by the impeachment of  
President Clinton and paralyzed by partisan clashes. He pledged to 
reach out to Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things that I want to do is to open the  
possibilities for this House to work together. We need to work 
together, especially on very substantive issues, on a bipartisan 
basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that his top legislative goals include reforming Social  
Security and Medicare, improving the nation's education system, 
providing tax relief and boosting national defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will be me and I'm not going to try to emulate Newt or  
anybody else,'' Hastert, the 57-year-old former high school teacher 
said when asked how he would differ from the outspoken Gingrich. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to start our agenda now,'' he said. ``We intend not to  
talk about those issues but deliver.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Chief May Have Gotten Gift Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch was  
given at least two Browning firearms by Salt Lake City's bid 
committee, a company official confirmed today. 
</P>
<P>
	Browning officials said the guns were delivered to Samaranch's  
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he did with the guns or how he used them, we don't  
know,'' said Browning spokesman Travis Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	A shotgun and rifle, which together had a retail value of about  
$1,000, were delivered by Browning's Swiss distributor in May 1995 
at the bid committee's request, Rich Bauter, vice president of 
firearms marketing for Browning, told The Salt Lake Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	One month later, the International Olympic Committee selected  
Salt Lake City as host of the 2002 Winter Olympics. Samaranch does 
not vote on host cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Rules at the time barred IOC members from accepting gifts in  
excess of $150. 
</P>
<P>
	Francois Carrard, the IOC's director general, said today that  
Samaranch had received a pistol and a rifle from Browning, the 
rifle in a case with a plaque engraved: ``Presented to President 
Juan Antonio Samaranch from the Browning Arms Co. on behalf of the 
people of Salt Lake City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No other officials at the IOC's headquarters in Lausanne  
received any of the Browning firearms,'' Carrard said in a letter 
faxed to the Tribune, a copy of which was provided to The 
Associated Press by the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, Samaranch appointed an IOC panel to investigate  
allegations the Salt Lake City bid committee bribed IOC members in 
its campaign to win the 2002 Winter Olympics by giving 
scholarships, free medical care and gifts to IOC members and their 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tribune reported today that Browning, based in Mountain  
Green, Utah, arranged to have the shotgun and rifle shipped from 
its Belgium warehouse to its Swiss distributor. The company then 
billed the bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The two firearms were:  
</P>
<P>
	-- A Browning ``Gold'' semiautomatic shotgun that retailed for  
about $475 in the United States at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A ``Euro Bolt'' bolt-action rifle that retailed for about  
$500. 
</P>
<P>
	``These were just basic hunting or what we call field guns.  
Nothing high-grade,'' Hall told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Browning previously disclosed that it sold nearly $10,000 worth  
of shotguns, rifles and cases at wholesale prices to the bid 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Samaranch was given other firearms by the bid committee  
is not known. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said the firearms maker sold the firearms and cases at  
wholesale prices to support the bid committee's effort to bring the 
Olympics to Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a public relations perspective, anytime we can get our  
guns in the hands of prominent people it helps promote our brand 
first and foremost,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The company decided to disclose information about its sale of  
guns to the bid committee because of the bribery scandal 
surrounding Salt Lake's Olympic bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't feel there was any wrongdoing on our part,'' Hall  
said. ``We have nothing to hide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the company has not been contacted by officials from any  
of the four investigations launched by the IOC, the U.S. Olympic 
Committee, an ethics panel of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee 
and the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	John MacAloon, author of a history of the Olympic movement, said  
Samaranch may not have been aware of the shotgun and rifle sent by 
the bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Deliveries of gifts arrive there daily,'' MacAloon told The  
Tribune. He said gifts given or sent to Samaranch often end up in 
the Olympic museum in Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch also received other gifts from the bid committee,  
according to The Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, at an IOC meeting in Tokyo, the bid committee gave  
Samaranch a chief's headdress made by Utah Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	The following year, during a visit to Utah, Samaranch and his  
wife were given a quilt made by Charlotte Warr Andersen of 
Taylorsville, Utah. Andersen said she made the quilt as a favor for 
Olympic bid leader Tom Welch's ex-wife, Alma. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Samaranch said, `This is a work of art. This will go  
into the Olympic Museum,' '' Andersen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Andersen said the bid committee paid her one-third of the  
quilt's appraised value, which she said was between $1,000 and 
$5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the headdress or quilt, the rifle and shotgun sent to  
Samaranch were ordinary firearms with little apparent value to a 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has promised to oust any IOC member found guilty of  
corruption.

<HEADLINE> Man Executed for '88 Texas Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A parolee who raped and strangled a  
77-year-old woman after she gave him a job doing lawn work was 
executed by injection Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	John Glenn Moody, 46, had nearly two dozen convictions over 19  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	He choked backed tears and spoke haltingly in a brief final  
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to apologize and ask forgiveness for any pain and  
suffering I have inflicted upon all of you, including my family,'' 
he said. ``All of you, I am very sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The execution was the first in Texas this year. Last year, 20  
Texas convicts were put to death, accounting for more than a 
quarter of all executions in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Moody had been out on parole for five months, having completed a  
seven-month term for burglary, when he was hired in July of 1988 by 
Maureen Louise Maulden to do yard work at her Abilene home. 
</P>
<P>
	The widow apparently was unaware of Moody's criminal past, which  
he blamed on drinking, drugs and a bad temper. 
</P>
<P>
	A sister found Mrs. Maulden's body. She had been raped, beaten  
with a fireplace brush and strangled with a telephone cord.

<HEADLINE> Nurses Cited for Chemo Overdose </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Eighteen nurses at a renowned cancer center have  
been cited for giving chemotherapy overdoses to two patients, one 
of whom died as a result. 
</P>
<P>
	The overdoses both occurred in 1994. At the time the Dana-Farber  
Cancer Institute's policy did not require nurses to double-check 
doctors' medication orders and verify their accuracy with 
experimental protocols or treatment plans. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Nursing held  
Monday that the nurses can be held accountable anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the 18 nurses cited by the state board have signed  
consent agreements to accept probation for one year and to undergo 
additional training. The other 16 face disciplinary hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	``The law states that the nurse is fully accountable for the  
safety of the care that he or she delivers,'' the board's executive 
director, Theresa Bonanno, told The Boston Globe in today's 
editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Dana-Farber, which had cited doctors and pharmacists as  
contributing to overdoses, now requires nurses to verify the 
accuracy of medication orders. 
</P>
<P>
	All the nurses are represented by Boston lawyer Frank Reardon,  
who said he will challenge the board's position that nurses are 
required to look into lengthy technical chemotherapy protocols 
before treating patients. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that in the 1994 overdose cases, the nurses were acting  
based on what a doctor considered to be appropriate dosages for 
each patient. 
</P>
<P>
	``My contention is that satisfied the nurses' requirement,''  
Reardon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The overdoses killed Betsy A. Lehman, 39, a health columnist for  
the Globe, and damaged the heart of Maureen Batemen, 53, a North 
Andover teacher, who died later of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctor who wrote the wrong orders, James Foran, was training

<HEADLINE> Testimony Helps Accused Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Thomas Capano's claim that his mistress  
accidentally shot his former lover got a boost Tuesday from a 
surprise witness. 
</P>
<P>
	A neighbor, Kim Johnson, remembered seeing Deborah MacIntyre  
speeding into her driveway one night in late June 1996, stumbling 
from her car and issuing a ``terrible sort of an anguished sob'' 
before running into her house. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Mrs. Johnson could not say exactly what day it was, she  
narrowed it to sometime between June 14 and July 1. Anne Marie 
Fahey, Capano's former lover, disappeared June 27, 1996 -- one of 
the few nights in that span that Ms. MacIntyre claims she did not 
spend with Capano. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano, 49, is a politically connected lawyer accused of  
murdering Ms. Fahey, the governor's scheduling secretary, and 
dumping her body at sea because she wanted to end their secret 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano maintains that Ms. MacIntyre found him and Ms. Fahey  
together at his house and, in a jealous, suicidal rage, 
accidentally fired a gunshot that killed Ms. Fahey. He says he sent 
Ms. MacIntyre home and dumped Ms. Fahey's body at sea to protect 
himself and Ms. MacIntyre. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. MacIntyre, who has become a prosecution witness, denies the  
accusation, saying she was not even at Capano's house that night. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Johnson's testimony backed up the time Capano claimed he  
sent Ms. MacIntyre home, saying she saw her come into her driveway, 
her tires squealing, about 11:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she approached defense lawyer Eugene Maurer only about  
two weeks ago with her story, after she saw reports of Capano's 
claims. She said she does not know the Capanos and only knows Ms. 
MacIntyre because Ms. MacIntyre's daughter used to baby-sit for 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Ferris Wharton attempted to discredit Mrs. Johnson's  
testimony by noting that she could not remember the day and refused 
to allow investigators -- who only learned of her story Monday night 
-- to see the bedroom from which she said she saw Ms. MacIntyre 
drive up. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, Superior Court Judge William Swain Lee scolded  
Capano for his outburst the day before, when he was removed from 
the courtroom after calling a prosecutor a ``heartless, gutless, 
soulless disgrace for a human being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee told a sullen, quiet Capano there would be ``Draconian  
sanctions'' if such behavior were repeated.

<HEADLINE> First Lady's Mom Gives Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton's mother says in a  
magazine interview she does not talk to her daughter about private 
things like the first couple's marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanity Fair reports in an article featuring rare public comment  
from the first lady's mother, Dorothy Rodham, that she and her 
daughter don't discuss ``deeply personal things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Writer Gail Sheehy quotes Mrs. Rodham as saying her daughter is  
a ``very sensitive person'' but not one given to excessive emotion. 
``She doesn't go into one of these horribly overwrought kinds of 
tizzies,'' she said. ``That's one thing I never did, either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine explores the Clintons' marriage in its February  
issue, reaching newsstands in New York on Wednesday and nationally 
Jan. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Rodham said her daughter is not the type to call her for  
unconditional love and support in a trying time. ``Hillary is 
really so mature,'' she said. ``She always has been. ... She's 
always thought things out for herself. Then if she needs more help 
or direction, she'll discuss things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But generally, she said, ``I don't talk to Hillary about  
anything deeply personal concerning her marriage. We don't sit down 
and have those mother-daughter discussions about how she relates to 
her husband, her daughter, or anything else as far as her personal 
life is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't talk about deeply personal things.''  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Rodham lives in a Little Rock, Ark., condominium and  
typically avoids interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she raised her children to keep their equilibrium,  
often using a carpenter's level to make her point. She would say: 
``Imagine having this carpenter's level inside you. You try to keep 
that bubble in the center. Sometimes it will go way up here and you 
have to bring it back.''

<HEADLINE> Suspect Dies in N.Y. Shooting-Arson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEEKSKILL, N.Y. (AP) -- A man shot his estranged wife, blasted  
his way into a neighbor's home when she fled there, then apparently 
set it afire and died in the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	John Singer said he was reading the Bible on Monday morning when  
Colleen Simmons pounded on his door, shouting, ``Call the police, 
he's going to kill me!'' 
</P>
<P>
	His wife let the bleeding woman in, Singer said, ``then my front  
door exploded'' when her husband, John Simmons, fired a shotgun 
blast. 
</P>
<P>
	The Singers and the two children who were home fled uninjured,  
and Mrs. Simmons, already critically wounded, also escaped. 
</P>
<P>
	After a short stakeout, police realized that the large Victorian  
house was on fire. The fire, which destroyed the home, was set in 
the house, said police. Human remains were found in the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	Peekskill police Sgt. Mark O'Buck said it was up to the medical  
examiner to say whether the body was Simmons', but he added, 
``We're not looking for anyone else. We don't suspect anybody 
else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Simmons, 37, was taken to the Westchester Medical Center,  
where her condition was upgraded today from critical to serious. 
</P>
<P>
	The Simmonses, who had four children ages 6 to 11, separated  
last year, police said. Simmons, a 50-year-old truck driver, had 
been living with friends and neighbors since. 
</P>
<P>
	The family apartment is about a block from the Singer home, and  
Singer said he knew Mrs. Simmons because they would see each other 
taking their children to the school bus stop. 
</P>
<P>
	The Singers, their home destroyed, spent the night in a house  
owned by a local church.

<HEADLINE> Fulmer Carries National Trophy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Tee Martin stood amid an ocean of orange and  
celebrated Tennessee's first national championship since 1951. 
Marcus Outzen slumped in a corner, head in hands, dismayed by 
Florida State's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who spent the previous two seasons in the shadow of top  
NFL draft pick Peyton Manning, had touchdown passes of 79 yards to 
Peerless Price and 4 yards to Shawn Bryson to cap the Volunteers' 
perfect season with a 23-16 Fiesta Bowl win Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to prove to everybody we were the No. 1 team in the  
nation,'' said Martin, whose Vols were underdogs in the game 
despite being undefeated and top-ranked. ``We had a chip on our 
shoulders. We won all our games. And we still didn't get our 
respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Volunteers, 13-0 for the first time in school history,  
received all 70 first-place votes in the final Associated Press 
media poll. Ohio State was second, followed by Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new Bowl Championship Series format, Tennessee was  
crowned national champion in the USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll 
immediately after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer, long a proponent of a playoff,  
benefited from the first BCS championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best system anyone has come up with so far,'' he  
said today as he accepted the writers' and coaches' championship 
trophies. ``I'd still like a playoff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the meeting of the nation's top two teams was far from the  
classic that organizers had envisioned when they set up a No. 1 vs. 
No. 2 showdown in the Fiesta Bowl. It featured seven turnovers and 
165 yards in penalties, and very little offense at times. 
</P>
<P>
	In many ways, the very imperfect victory was a microcosm of a  
Tennessee season in which the Volunteers stumbled but never fell. 
</P>
<P>
	``All year long we've been called a team of destiny,'' Fulmer  
said. ``During the course of the year, we did what we had to do. It 
wasn't always perfect, it wasn't always pretty, but they found a 
way to get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fulmer saluted his players. ``It's just an incredible run by an  
incredible football team,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The coach said the national championship would have an impact on  
the program. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the expectations are going to be high,'' he said. ``At  
Tennessee, they always are. With success comes expectations and we 
accept that. We want to be in the mix of people known as the best 
football teams in the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State, which has finished in the top four in the final  
poll for the past 12 seasons, made too many mistakes and couldn't 
generate much offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Sophomore quarterback Marcus Outzen, making his third start in  
place of the injured Chris Weinke, was harassed into a 9-of-22 
performance for 145 yards. He threw two interceptions, one of which 
was returned 54 yards for a touchdown by Dwayne Goodrich, and was 
dropped for 54 yards in losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I did some good things. Of course, I did some bad  
things,'' Outzen said. ``In every aspect of the game, our team made 
mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State coach Bobby Bowden said his team showed the  
effects of not having played in 44 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were a very, very rusty football team,'' Bowden said.  
``They made more big plays than we did. We had a hard time getting 
the ball to our threat, and they deserved to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles' threat, wide receiver Peter Warrick, was held to  
one catch for 7 yards -- though he did add an electrifying 51-yard 
punt return, evading four tacklers, to help set up one of Florida 
State's scores. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who had thrown just 16 passes the past two years in a  
backup role, did what Manning couldn't -- win a national title. He 
was 11 of 18 for 278 yards against the nation's toughest pass 
defense, while Price caught four passes for 199 yards and was voted 
the game's MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Martin) played an outstanding game,'' Fulmer said. ``He knows  
how to manage a game. As the season has gone along, he's gotten 
better and better. I would not trade Tee Martin for anyone in the 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vols took a 14-0 lead on a pair of touchdowns in a 25-second  
span of the second quarter and led 14-9 at halftime. Neither team 
scored in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin threw his second touchdown pass, the 79-yarder to Price,  
with 9:17 to go to put the Vols ahead 20-9 and Jeff Hall kicked a 
23-yard field goal with 6:01 left. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Seminoles (11-2) rallied.  
</P>
<P>
	Florida State cut the lead to 23-16 on Outzen's 7-yard scoring  
run with 3:42 left. Sebastian Janikowski's ensuing onside kick was 
recovered by Florida State, but officials ruled the ball hit the 
kicker's hand after it had traveled only 7 yards and the Vols took 
possession. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State recovered a Tennessee fumble two minutes later,  
giving the Seminoles a final chance. But on the first play after 
the fumble, Outzen's long pass was intercepted by Steve Johnson and 
the Vols ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels great, it feels great,'' Martin said in the middle of  
a wild celebration at midfield. ``All the adversity we faced -- all 
the guys that went to the NFL last year, all the shoes we had to 
fill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Price: ``Nobody believed us.''  
</P>
<P>
	They probably do now.

<HEADLINE> Italian Wins World Cup Giant Slalom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KRANJSKA GORA, Slovenia (AP) -- Italy's Patrick Holzer stunned  
the dominant Austrian team Tuesday, winning a World Cup giant 
slalom for his first victory in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel a little strange being ahead of the Austrians,'' Holzer  
said. ``They are so strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holzer was sixth after the first run, then skied a flawless  
second run for a combined time of 2 minutes, 14.91 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Hermann Maier, the overall World Cup leader and winner of four  
races this season, placed 20th. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a difficult course today that didn't suit my style,''  
Maier said. ``But I am confident I'll do better in the next races 
in Austria.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The powerful Austrian team, however, still finished 2-3-4.  
</P>
<P>
	Christian Mayer, winner of the giant slalom here last year,  
finished second at 2:15.15. Hans Knauss skied two solid runs down 
the steep and icy hill to place third, .31 seconds behind Holzer. 
Benjamin Raich was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Austrian Stephan Eberharter, who was atop the World Cup giant  
slalom standings going into the race, finished 16th and slid to 
fourth in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Switzerland's Michael Von Gruenigen, the world giant slalom  
champion and winner of the most recent giant slalom, finished 
eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	Holzer's last victory was in 1992 when he won a super-G at  
Garmisch, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	His performances this season have been steadily improving and at  
the last giant slalom race in Alta Badia, Italy, he was a 
surprising second. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am 28 years old, so it's time I either make it or go home,''  
Holzer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I have changed in my skiing is that I have  
become more aggressive.''

<HEADLINE> Ashcroft Won't Run for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- After spending more than a year building  
up to a potential conservative bid for the White House in 2000, 
Republican Sen. John Ashcroft took himself out of the running 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 56-year-old former governor said he will instead concentrate  
on winning a second Senate term. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a time for individuals to place ambition above the  
needs of the American people. Leadership is about making choices,'' 
Ashcroft told about 400 cheering supporters in the Boys and Girls 
Club gymnasium where he once played basketball. ``No friends that I 
have are better than the friends I have in Springfield, Missouri.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state's junior senator and former two-term governor and  
attorney general had been considered a leading conservative 
contender and was the early choice of several social conservative 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ashcroft's advisers had been worried about whether he could  
raise enough money for a presidential campaign, a doubt also 
plaguing several other possible candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	And some Republicans had wanted him to focus exclusively on  
winning re-election to the Senate in 2000, when he faces a fierce 
challenge from popular Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan and the 
Republicans risk losing their Senate majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft also was confronted with the ticklish task of pleasing  
national religious conservatives without alienating moderates at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	And by broadening his message and toning down his comments on  
such issues as abortion and President Clinton's character, as he 
did in recent weeks, Ashcroft angered leaders of the party's social 
conservative wing. 
</P>
<P>
	He will need to woo moderates for a Senate race against  
Carnahan, who labels Ashcroft an extremist while describing himself 
as moderate progressive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's very far to the right,'' Carnahan said Tuesday in  
Jefferson City. ``Politically he has exposed that. He's part of the 
extreme element of the Republican Party and I don't think that will 
serve Missouri or the nation well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft didn't mention abortion during his speech Tuesday. But  
he did turn up the rhetoric about Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a president with more than the capacity to govern. We  
need a president with the character to lead,'' Ashcroft told the 
crowd. ``The brute power of government can provide a basis for 
ruling. But only the moral force of character can provide a basis 
for leading.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Janet, said she was happy about his decision not to  
run for the White House. ``When I hugged him, I just said `Thank 
you, John,''' she told KYTV-TV.

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com's Sales Soar in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Amazon.com's fourth-quarter sales more than  
tripled from a year ago, boosted by a strong holiday season when 
more than a million new customers bought from the giant Internet 
bookseller. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Seattle-based company said today that the big sales  
gains will not reduce its expected losses for the fourth quarter. 
Wall Street analysts estimate a loss of 56 cents a share for the 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com's stock fell almost 10 percent in early trading  
before rebounding by mid-morning. Its shares were trading up $6.37 
at $124 3/4. That reflects a 3-for-1 stock split that took effect 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com's fourth-quarter sales were about $250 million, up  
dramatically from $66 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon's sales gains were the latest evidence of huge growth in  
Internet commerce during the holiday season. Many retailers, 
selling everything from natural foods to down parkas, have reported 
sharp increases in business. 
</P>
<P>
	From Nov. 17 to Dec. 31, Amazon.com shipped more than 7.5  
million items, topping the total for all of 1997. Fueling some of 
its gains was its expansion into other areas beyond books. It now 
sells videos, music and a selection of toys and electronics. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the strong sales, higher customer service costs and  
aggressive pricing will reduce profits, chief financial officer Joy 
Covey said.

<HEADLINE> Layoff Left Florida State Lagging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Playing once a week, 44 days is enough time  
for six football games, or half a season. 
</P>
<P>
	But for 44 days Florida State played not at all - and then came  
Monday night's Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were a very rusty, rusty football team,'' coach Bobby  
Bowden said after his Seminoles lost the game and a national 
championship to Tennessee, 23-16. ``They played about two weeks 
after us, I believe, but ... that didn't help either one of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State ended its regular season with a 23-12 victory over  
Florida on Nov. 21 while Tennessee last played in the SEC 
championship game on Dec. 5, defeating Mississippi State 24-14. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles showed the effects of the long layoff with 12  
penalties for 110 yards; defensive lapses that led to long passes 
including one for a touchdown; missed blocking assignments on the 
offensive line; and a pair of interceptions, one going for a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were a very sloppy football team,'' Bowden said. ``They  
were, too, at times. I mean, a lot of that, being off a month and a 
half, (we) probably could have done a little bit better if we 
hadn't been off quite that long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sloppy play belied Florida State's slogan for its  
season-long drive to the national championship game: ``Discipline 
to the Desert.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our discipline wasn't very good,'' Bowden acknowledged.  
</P>
<P>
	Offensive guard Jason Whitaker summed up the night this way:  
</P>
<P>
	``They say if you keep making the same mistakes you are stupid.  
I guess we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The penalties were critical. Florida State's Reggie Durden  
returned a Tennessee punt to the Volunteers' 29-yard line. But the 
play was called back because of a roughing-the-kicker penalty, 
erasing a scoring opportunity early in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Another roughing call on a field goal attempt led to Tennessee's  
first touchdown in the second quarter. In the third quarter, a 
21-yard scramble by Seminole quarterback Marcus Outzen to the 
Tennessee 15-yard line for an apparent first down was called back 
because of a holding penalty. It stopped the drive and Florida 
State had to punt two plays later. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles' frustration with the way they played was evident  
on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	``That didn't help at all when we started shooting ourselves in  
the foot and then started picking at one another about how we were 
playing,'' Whitaker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Inexperience at quarterback also contributed to the Seminoles'  
woes. Outzen, subbing for the injured Dan Kendra and Chris Weinke, 
was making only his third start, but he said he did all he could. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I failed to win the game,'' he said. ``I think I  
did some good things. Of course, I did some bad things. I don't 
think the game was on my shoulders. The team didn't win this game.

<HEADLINE> Bill Paxon Joins D.C. Law Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Paxon, the former New York congressman  
and a key player in the GOP takeover of Congress, has joined a 
historically Democratic powerhouse law and lobbying firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP; Feld, one of Washington's major  
firms, was founded by Robert Strauss, a former chairman of the 
Democratic National Committee. Vernon Jordan, a close friend of 
President Clinton's, is a senior partner. 
</P>
<P>
	``And now they have one of Denny Hastert's, Trent Lott's and  
other Republicans' good friends,'' Paxon said Tuesday in an 
interview. Hastert, R-Ill., is the incoming House speaker and Lott, 
R-Miss., is Senate majority leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``I intend to do everything I can to make sure that the  
Republican names and faces are well know here and we're well known 
to our Republican friends around town, around the country,'' said 
Paxon, who will be a lobbyist and senior adviser at the firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Paxon made his mark as chairman of the National Republican  
Congressional Committee. He played a top role in recruiting the 
candidates, raising the money and drafting the strategy that in 
1994 won his party a majority in the House of Representatives for 
the first time in four decades. 
</P>
<P>
	He was later implicated in a failed coup to topple House Speaker  
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. After mounting a campaign to challenge House 
Majority Leader Dick Armey, Paxon stunned colleagues by announcing 
he would retire at the end of 1998. He served 10 years in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Paxon and his wife, former Staten Island, N.Y., congresswoman  
Susan Molinari, are expecting a second child at the end of the 
month. Molinari left Congress for what turned out to be a brief 
stint as a television personality.

<HEADLINE> Vols' Town Giddy Over Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee fans welcomed home coach  
Phillip Fulmer, snapped up souvenirs and embraced the Vols' 
national football championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an exciting time for all of Tennessee football,''  
Fulmer told a crowd greeting him and his wife Vicky with applause 
as they moved through McGhee Tyson Airport on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our kids have had a phenomenal season. We're really proud to  
be a part of history by being the first unified champion, and we 
are very appreciative of the unbelievable support all season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Volunteers won the national championship and completed a  
13-0 season Monday night with a 23-16 victory over Florida State in 
the Fiesta Bowl. It was the Vols' first national football title 
since 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	Fulmer stopped in Knoxville only long enough to hop another  
plane for a recruiting trip. His players went their separate ways 
with their families from Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	An official celebration and parade are planned for Jan. 16 after  
students return from winter break. But the date could be changed 
because it's the same day as Gov. Don Sundquist's inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are all these conflicts,'' Deputy Mayor Gene Patterson  
said, noting it also is falls on the weekend before the Martin 
Luther King Jr. holiday. ``But this only happens about once every 
half-century, so we can't wait until the next one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Mayor Victor Ashe is proposing to rename Stadium  
Drive in front of Neyland Stadium to Phillip Fulmer Way. 
</P>
<P>
	A small electronic sign behind the counter of the downtown post  
office flashed the message in orange pulses: ``A Perfect Season ... 
How 'Bout Them ... Vols.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this was the year of destiny, fate, call it whatever  
you want to,'' Will Kirkpatrick said. ``I think UT was destined to 
make it where they did this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knoxville sports bars were packed with boisterous,  
cigar-smoking, high-fiving fans Monday night. The city's embrace 
was more low-key Tuesday morning as commemorative caps appeared on 
the heads of downtown workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Tostitos, sponsor of the Fiesta Bowl, flooded grocery stores  
with commemorative bags of chips. The Make-A-Wish Foundation hoped 
to raise $25,000 through sales of 5,000 commemorative Tennessee 
footballs. 
</P>
<P>
	And retailers with UT goods expected to sell millions of dollars  
in merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	Souvenir makers Bacon &AMP; Co. of Knoxville and New Hampshire-based  
Pro Player cranked up their printing operations as soon as the game 
was in hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came in at about midnight, and I would say we will be here  
until midnight tonight,'' Bacon &AMP; Co. spokesman Jed Dance said. 
``Or maybe around the clock again, if we can stand up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Tennessee Fever, another Vols souvenir store, spokesman John  
Weaver said fans were waiting when he opened at 7:30 a.m. Half of 
the 600 championship items he stocked were sold by midday. 
</P>
<P>
	What's selling? ``Hats, shirts, anything that says `Tennessee  
national champions,''' he said. And more is on the way. ``License 
plates, trash cans, flags, ties, anything you can put an orange `T' 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knoxville News-Sentinel was expecting strong demand for its  
Tuesday edition, so it printed 215,000 copies instead of the normal 
125,000. The front page featured the headline ``CHAMPIONS!'' 
printed in orange. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are selling them as fast as we can print them,'' publisher  
Bruce Hartmann said.

<HEADLINE> Peace Corps Begins Recruiting Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Peace Corps is looking for more than 4,000  
volunteers to build up its force of Americans serving abroad this 
year, but will fall short of President Clinton's goal of 10,000 by 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Peace Corps Director Mark Gearan said he still hopes to meet the  
goal early in the next century. With plans for the biggest 
recruitment in 25 years and about half the current volunteers still 
in the field, the year-end figure should exceed 7,000, he said. 
Currently, 6,700 volunteers serve in 80 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Gearan said Congress' 8 percent increase in the Peace Corps  
budget this year to $240 million was not enough to build up the 
volunteer corps to 10,000 in a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Peace Corps, which recently moved into a new  
storefront headquarters in Washington, released the names of 
colleges and universities with the largest number of graduates now 
serving overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The University of Wisconsin topped the list with 116, followed  
by the University of Colorado at Boulder with 91 and the University 
of Washington with 75. 
</P>
<P>
	Among small colleges, with fewer than 5,000 undergraduates,  
American University in Washington, D.C., led with 36 alumni serving 
as volunteers, followed by the University of Chicago, with 23, and 
Carleton College of Northfield, Minn., with 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Other schools in the top 10 were the University of Illinois,  
with 75; the University of Michigan, 71; the University of 
California at Davis, 64; Colorado State University, 63; Michigan 
State, 62; and Cornell, Indiana University at Bloomington and the 
University of Oregon, 58 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Gearan said 97 percent of Peace Corps volunteers hold at least a  
bachelor's degree, and 15 percent have graduate degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	But accelerated Peace Corps recruiting will look well beyond  
college campuses this year, Gearan said. The average age of Peace 
Corps volunteers is 29, with 7 percent over 50 years old. The Peace 
Corps has no upper age limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Peace Corps volunteers receive living expenses, health care  
coverage and a readjustment allowance after their service. They 
work to help fight hunger, bring clean water to communities, teach 
children, help start new small businesses and work to stop the 
spread of AIDS, the Peace Corps said. Since its start in 1961, more 
than 150,000 Americans have served as volunteers.

<HEADLINE> AirTouch Confirms Vodafone Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AirTouch Communications Inc., already in talks  
with Bell Atlantic about a merger that would create a nationwide 
cellular telephone network, said today it has received a rival 
offer from Britain's Vodafone Group PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	Vodafone is the largest mobile phone service provider in Britain  
and has been expanding its cellular coverage in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco-based AirTouch is the largest independent wireless  
company in the United States, and has interests in 12 international 
cellular joint ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	An AirTouch-Vodafone deal ``makes a lot of sense on an  
international basis,'' said Crispman Vicars, an industry analyst 
with the Yankee Group in Boston. ``They are already partners on a 
number of European joint ventures, and the only market where they 
actually compete with each other is in Germany.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Vicars questioned whether Vodafone really wants to  
enter the highly competitive U.S. cellular market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal reported today that the Vodafone offer  
topped Bell Atlantic's proposal, which is said to be around $45 
billion, though neither company would confirm the price. Bell 
Atlantic declined comment today on Vodafone's offer. 
</P>
<P>
	On the news of the bidding competition, prices of all three  
companies' shares were rising today on the New York Stock Exchange. 
AirTouch jumped $4.37 1/2 to $72.62 1/2 a share at late morning, Bell 
Atlantic was up $1.43 3/4 at $53.37 1/2 and Vodophone's U.S. stock shot 
up $7.12 1/2 at $181.75. 
</P>
<P>
	AirTouch would be an attractive acquisition for Bell Atlantic.  
If New York-based Bell Atlantic, which provides local and cellular 
phone service on the East Coast, could acquire AirTouch's West 
Coast network, the merged business could put more pressure on AT&AMP;T 
to cut prices on its flat-rate cellular phone plan. MCI WorldCom 
Inc. and other companies also may have to act fast to get into the 
cellular market, U.S. analysts said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	As technology for cellular phones has improved, and the need for  
them has increased, the number of users in the United States has 
soared to 61 million, up from just 14 million in 1993, according to 
the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Cell phones, however, are still a pricey luxury for many  
consumers, and the new one-rate plans are aimed at high-end 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	In May AT&AMP;T Corp., the nation's largest long-distance company,  
launched a plan that allows customers to call anywhere in the 
United States for $89.99 for 600 minutes of use. This allows 
consumers to avoid extra ``roaming'' charges when they travel 
outside their local area. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Bell Atlantic offered a competing plan at $159  
a month for 1,600 minutes. Bell Atlantic, which has a strong 
network from Maine to South Carolina, has to charge more because it 
relies on costly agreements with other phone companies to complete 
calls outside its areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Both plans, however, are still out of reach for many cellular  
phone users, who spend $46 a month, on average, plus long-distance 
charges, according to the Cellular Telecommunications Industry 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, phone companies ``are going where the money is,''  
said Jeffrey Kagan, an independent telecommunications analyst in 
Atlanta. ``Competitive pressures from Bell Atlantic will bring that 
down market to the average consumer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic, which is awaiting governmental approval of its  
$65 billion purchase of GTE Corp., will likely have to sell off any 
assets that overlap with AirTouch. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Hines, a telecom analyst with BT Alex Brown, estimated  
that if Bell Atlantic's combinations with both GTE and AirTouch go 
through, the combined company would have to sell off 15 percent of 
its U.S. assets to reduce its market power in areas like San 
Francisco, San Diego and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether or not the Bell Atlantic talks with AirTouch are  
successful, the cellular phone industry is going to continue to 
consolidate as companies try to piece together nationwide networks. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom, which has been sitting on the cellular sidelines,  
is one company that Wall Street expects to get in the game. Nextel 
Communications Inc., one of the largest independent wireless phone 
companies, is the most likely target, said Hines.

<HEADLINE> Bulldogs Get Tark His 700th Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- Jerry Tarkanian ushered in the New Year  
with his 700th career victory and resolved to retire before piling 
up a hundred more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't remember when my 600th win was. I will remember  
this one and I can guarantee you, you won't see 800,'' Tarkanian 
said after Fresno State beat No. 15 New Mexico 86-80 in a 
down-to-the-wire thriller. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarkanian, in his fourth year at Fresno State, will remember  
Monday night's game for more than one reason. 
</P>
<P>
	The defeat of the Lobos was Fresno State's first over a ranked  
opponent since beating then-No. 8 Utah in 1995-96, the season 
Tarkanian took over at his alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
	That it came at the school where he got his degree and played  
made it extra special. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I've been saying all along is that Fresno State means a  
lot to me because I went to school here,'' said Tarkanian, a 1955 
graduate who was on the team his junior and senior years. ``This is 
where I went to college and where my wife went to college.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, after being treated to a halfcourt celebration of  
balloons, streamers and a standing ovation from the sellout crowd 
of 10,220, Tark shrugged off the milestone and focused on this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 700 wins really doesn't make that much of a difference to  
me,'' he said. ``What was important is that we are 1-0 in the 
Western Atlantic Conference. This was a big, big game because this 
was one of the top teams in the conference and we had to get this 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tarkanian coached seven years at the junior college level and  
then began accumulating wins and titles at Long Beach State and 
UNLV before returning to his college haunts. 
</P>
<P>
	He is in his 28th year at a major college and working under an  
extended contract at Fresno State. Although he has hinted at 
retirement, he has yet to attach a date to it. His 700-162 record 
gives him a winning percentage of 81.2 that ranks fourth in major 
college history. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarkanian actually began the season with 688 victories, but  
added one to that total when LSU's 1997 victory over Fresno State 
was forfeited when it was revealed the Tigers had used an 
ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
	That meant that Tarkanian needed only 11 victories to become the  
12th major college coach to reach 700. And his Bulldogs, with a 
full squad in uniform for the first time this season, came through. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what we wanted to do. It was on national television  
against a ranked team, and we wanted this win for him,'' said 
Courtney Alexander, who led the Bulldogs with 26 points.

<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Red Sox agreed to terms on one-year deals with  
pitchers Rheal Cormier and Kip Gross on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cormier, a left-hander, agreed to a minor league contract with  
an invitation to major league spring training camp. Right-hander 
Gross accepted a major league deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Cormier, 31, was a member of the Red Sox pitching staff during  
their 1995 AL East Division Championship season, posting a 7-5 
record and a 4.07 ERA in 48 games. 
</P>
<P>
	He hasn't pitched in the major leagues since going on the  
disabled list in April 1997 while playing for the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
	Gross, 34, has pitched for the Nippon Ham Fighters in Japan's  
Pacific League from 1994-98. He led the league in 1995 with 16 wins 
and in 1996 with 17 wins. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed the first half of last season with an elbow injury.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Higher; Dow Up 36 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were firmer in late morning trading, with  
blue-chips lifted by technology and industrial shares. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 36.04 at 9,220.31. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was up 4.97 at 1,233.07 , and the technology-heavy Nasdaq 
composite index was up 12.93 at 2,220.98. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-6 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 202.07 million 
shares, up from Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Jones industrial average components were led higher by IBM,  
up 1 1/2 at 184 1/2, AT&AMP;T, up 1 1/2 at 79 3/8, Alcoa, up 1 1/2 at 75 1/4, and Procter 
&AMP; Gamble, up 1 5/16 at 91 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard A. Dickson, a technical analyst at Scott &AMP; Stringfellow  
Inc. in Richmond, Va., said stocks were higher on the continued 
expectation that investors will make major purchases with yearend 
cash reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure people have committed money to the market yet,''  
he said, ``and in that sense you're going to see some buying on the 
dips. It's just another opportunity to step in and buy. And the 
fact that we're not seeing any tremendous weakness in the old 
leaders certainly adds to that confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In economic news, the Commerce Department said U.S. construction  
spending increased for the sixth consecutive month in November, 
propelled by strong gains in housing and government projects. 
Spending advanced 0.9 percent from the month before to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of $677.8 billion. Dickson said the news did 
not affect trading much. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said investors are concerned about the drop in the dollar  
over the last two days in the wake of the inauguration of trading 
in the new Euro. The dollar was lower against the yen and the Euro 
this morning, pushing bonds lower with it. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online, which was added to the S&AMP;P 500 composite last  
week, was up 3/4 at 149 9/16 in leading volume on the New York Stock 
Exchange after losing ground Monday.

<HEADLINE> All About Product Warranties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Q: My refrigerator is making loud groaning sounds and I've only  
had it for four months. Since I never sent in the official-looking 
warranty card, am I going to have to pay to get it fixed? 

</P>
<P>
	A: Warranty cards -- whether for weed whackers or washing  
machines -- aren't as ominous as they appear. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not important, or necessary, to fill out the card in  
order to get warranty service,'' says Todd Marks, senior editor at 
Consumer Reports magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	The cards, which usually ask questions about income or product  
preferences, are mainly used for marketing purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	If you bought a coffee-maker, a company may try to sell you its  
bread-maker. A computer software manufacturer may advise when a new 
version is available and offer you a discount if you want to buy 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Some companies may also take the information from the card and  
sell it to other companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the plus side, the little cards are really the only way a  
company has of alerting you in case of a product recall,'' says 
Marks, who writes the monthly product recall column for Consumer 
Reports. 
</P>
<P>
	To ensure proper warranty coverage, however, it's important to  
hang on to a far less serious-looking document -- the receipt. Marks 
recommends stapling it to the back of the owner's manual and filing 
that away. 
</P>
<P>
	At General Electric Co., a leading maker of consumer appliances,  
owners don't have to send in the card or have their receipt to get 
warranty coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	All that's needed is the model or serial number, which is  
stamped somewhere on the product, says spokesman Chip Keeling. He 
says GE encourages folks to register the product, however, and 
gives them the option of using a toll-free phone number or the 
Internet, in addition to the tried-and-true warranty card, to get 
the job done.

<HEADLINE>  NHL's Blues Given Record $1.5M Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The New Jersey Devils got a lot. They wanted  
more. 
</P>
<P>
	While a shock to those on the receiving end, the NHL-record $1.5  
million fine levied against the St. Louis Blues for tampering with 
defenseman Scott Stevens wasn't anywhere near what the Devils had 
asked for. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues admitted wrongdoing in the 4-year-old case and won't  
contest the fine, levied by commissioner Gary Bettman for violation 
of the NHL constitution and by-laws. He also ordered the Blues to 
surrender one first-round pick to the New Jersey Devils between 
1999 and 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devils receive $1.425 million of the fine amount, and the  
rest goes to the NHL, payable within 120 days of Dec. 28, the day 
the penalty was handed down. The NHL made the fine public on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the Devils have been awarded the one-time right to  
trade first-round positions with St. Louis in any other Entry Draft 
over the time period. The Devils must inform the NHL by May 1 
preceding each Entry Draft when they plan to exercise the option, 
and the Blues have a one-time deferral right. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not enough to satisfy Devils general manager Lou  
Lamoriello, who had requested five first-round picks plus monetary 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the compensation could be severe enough,''  
Lamoriello said. ``Anybody who tries to cheat, and I don't know if 
that's the word to use, should be reprimanded to the highest 
order.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In any case, Lamoriello wasn't crowing, at least publicly.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't look at something of this nature as a triumph,''  
Lamoriello said. ``I think we have a situation where it did happen 
and quite frankly it should not have happened, and quite frankly 
things like this should not happen in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In settling the case, Bettman felt the same way.  
</P>
<P>
	``I view the Blues' conduct with respect to Mr. Stevens to be  
abhorrent and deserving of the harshest sanctions,'' Bettman said 
in a release. ``Violations of the no-tampering provisions directly 
undermine the integrity of the league and the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues cooperated with the league's investigation, not that  
they felt it lessened the blow. Jerry Ritter, the team's chairman 
since 1996, lambasted the previous management team of chairman Mike 
Shanahan and president Jack Quinn. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am appalled at the severity of the penalty imposed on the  
Blues,'' Ritter said. ``I'm more appalled at the legacy left to the 
Blues and their fans by the management team led by Shanahan and 
Quinn. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is management's responsibility to make certain that events  
of this nature are not allowed to occur on their watch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bettman fined the Blues $500,000 for tampering by negotiating  
terms of a free-agent offer to Stevens prior to the free-agent 
signing period that began July 1, 1994. The bigger fine, a $1 
million hit, was for entering into a side deal with Stevens and his 
agent, the late Richard Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devils matched the Blues' four-year, $17.5 million offer  
sheet signed by Stevens on July 4, 1994 -- then the highest ever 
made to a defenseman and $7 million more than the Devils' last 
offer. The fallout from the side deal was New Jersey also had to 
paid Stevens $500,000 the Blues had owed as deferred compensation 
arising from Stevens' signing bonus from his one season with the 
team in 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the deal, the Blues were relieved of their  
compensation obligation if another team signed Stevens on the same 
terms as their offer sheet. Lamoriello said the Blues' new 
management allowed the NHL to look into their records early last 
year and several documents relating to the tampering were found, 
including an offer sheet sent to the agent prior to July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess if you're in the stock world, doing these types of  
things, you may be in jail'' for such actions, Blues general 
manager Larry Pleau said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens was never asked to testify in hearings. He said Sunday  
that he didn't believe tampering occurred, but Lamoriello suggested 
that Bennett handled all of the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettman's ruling comes more than five months after a July 27,  
1998, hearing involving the Blues and Devils. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues and Devils were at odds throughout the early 1990s,  
with Stevens the focal point. St. Louis pried Stevens away from 
Washington by signing him to a free agent deal in 1990, then lost 
their captain to New Jersey after only one season as compensation 
for signing Devils free agent Brendan Shanahan. The Blues' 
determination to get him back apparently led to the tampering. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation, dormant for a long time, heated up again in  
the last year after disclosures to the Devils from a former member 
of the Blues' front office. Sauer, the Blues' president since 1996, 
said the team found documents that indicated the former front 
office person negotiated a contract with Stevens ``weeks'' before 
the signing period began. 
</P>
<P>
	Sauer's still puzzled by the Blues' actions.  
</P>
<P>
	``Why do it when you're going to have a clean shot at him?''  
Sauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fine comes on the heels of the Blues' fourth cash call in as  
many years, this one for $17.7 million, with much of the extra 
money paying deferred compensation to players no longer on the 
roster. The team is owned by a consortium of local businessmen who 
have pumped an additional $70 million into the Blues and the Kiel 
Center, which opened in 1994, during the four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Sauer said the fine was taken into account in the latest cash  
call and said the team's operation will not change.

<HEADLINE> 'Patch Adams' Tops Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- On a weekend when Midwest storms kept people  
away from the movies, Universal Studios got a final holiday gift 
from ``Patch Adams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Robin Williams film about a doctor who relies on comedy as  
part of his cures was the top film at North American theaters for 
the second consecutive weekend, according to industry figures 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Though critically panned, ``Patch Adams'' grossed $19.1 million  
to give struggling Universal a much-needed boost. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the snowbound box office was down about 5 percent from  
the same weekend last year. Still, a number of 1998 movies 
continued to do strong business in wide release, while such Oscar 
entries as ``Shakespeare in Love,'' ``Affliction,'' ``Waking Ned 
Devine'' and ``The Thin Red Line'' attracted large crowds on fewer 
screens. 
</P>
<P>
	The dying mother drama ``Stepmom,'' with Susan Sarandon and  
Julia Roberts, finished second with $14.6 million, ahead of the 
romantic comedy ``You've Got Mail'' with $14.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Prince of Egypt'' was fourth with $11.2 million while  
another animated feature, ``A Bug's Life,'' was fifth with $8.8 
million, losing only 16 percent of its audience in the seventh 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love,'' riding a wave of critical raves and  
Golden Globe nominations, was shaping up to be a sleeper hit, 
collecting $3.2 million on just 299 screens to bring its total to 
$9.4 million.

<HEADLINE> Fiesta Bowl Ratings Disappointing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Under the new bowl coalition format that crowned  
a clear-cut national champion, more people were expected to watch 
the 1999 Fiesta Bowl title game. That didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee's national championship victory in the Fiesta Bowl was  
watched in more than 17 million homes, for a 17.2 national rating. 
Even though two games had national title implications last year, 
the Rose Bowl still managed a higher (17.6) rating. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the 1998 Rose Bowl featured Michigan winning a  
last-second thriller over Washington State while the Orange Bowl 
pitted Nebraska against Tennessee and grabbed a 13.3 rating. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolverines and Cornhuskers finished the season with a share  
of the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's contest was a yawner for much of the game, until the  
final minutes when Florida State cut the deficit to seven points. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expected the Fiesta Bowl would do a pretty good number, but  
I thought it would be better than that,'' said ABC analyst Todd 
Blackledge, who worked the Fiesta Bowl on Monday night. ``One of 
the factors may have been that both teams were from the southeast, 
so it was kind of a regional game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new format, four bowl games comprise the Bowl  
Championship Series -- Fiesta, Rose, Orange and Sugar. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining three bowls actually fared better than last  
season's No. 2, 3 and 4 games. 
</P>
<P>
	What was even more impressive was that it was done without top  
draws Notre Dame, Michigan and Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
	``The BCS has had a positive impact on TV ratings,'' ABC  
spokesman Mark Mandel said. ``But the bigger picture of all of this 
is that it crowned a national champion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This season's Rose Bowl, a shootout won by Wisconsin over UCLA,  
posted a 13.6 rating, which was 2 percent higher than the 1998 
Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 Sugar Bowl, in which Ohio State won easily over Texas  
A&AMP;M, had a 11.5 rating -- an increase of 3 percent from last year's 
game between Ohio State and Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orange Bowl this year was the lowest-rated of the BCS bowls,  
a 8.4 rating. That was still well ahead of the either the Cotton 
(6.2) or Fiesta (5.8) in 1998.

<HEADLINE>  NHL's Blues Given Record $1.5M Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The New Jersey Devils got a lot. They wanted  
more. 
</P>
<P>
	While a shock to those on the receiving end, the NHL-record $1.5  
million fine levied against the St. Louis Blues for tampering with 
defenseman Scott Stevens wasn't anywhere near what the Devils had 
asked for. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues admitted wrongdoing in the 4-year-old case and won't  
contest the fine, levied by commissioner Gary Bettman for violation 
of the NHL constitution and by-laws. He also ordered the Blues to 
surrender one first-round pick to the New Jersey Devils between 
1999 and 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devils receive $1.425 million of the fine amount, and the  
rest goes to the NHL, payable within 120 days of Dec. 28, the day 
the penalty was handed down. The NHL made the fine public on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the Devils have been awarded the one-time right to  
trade first-round positions with St. Louis in any other Entry Draft 
over the time period. The Devils must inform the NHL by May 1 
preceding each Entry Draft when they plan to exercise the option, 
and the Blues have a one-time deferral right. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not enough to satisfy Devils general manager Lou  
Lamoriello, who had requested five first-round picks plus monetary 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the compensation could be severe enough,''  
Lamoriello said. ``Anybody who tries to cheat, and I don't know if 
that's the word to use, should be reprimanded to the highest 
order.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In any case, Lamoriello wasn't crowing, at least publicly.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't look at something of this nature as a triumph,''  
Lamoriello said. ``I think we have a situation where it did happen 
and quite frankly it should not have happened, and quite frankly 
things like this should not happen in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In settling the case, Bettman felt the same way.  
</P>
<P>
	``I view the Blues' conduct with respect to Mr. Stevens to be  
abhorrent and deserving of the harshest sanctions,'' Bettman said 
in a release. ``Violations of the no-tampering provisions directly 
undermine the integrity of the league and the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues cooperated with the league's investigation, not that  
they felt it lessened the blow. Jerry Ritter, the team's chairman 
since 1996, lambasted the previous management team of chairman Mike 
Shanahan and president Jack Quinn. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am appalled at the severity of the penalty imposed on the  
Blues,'' Ritter said. ``I'm more appalled at the legacy left to the 
Blues and their fans by the management team led by Shanahan and 
Quinn. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is management's responsibility to make certain that events  
of this nature are not allowed to occur on their watch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bettman fined the Blues $500,000 for tampering by negotiating  
terms of a free-agent offer to Stevens prior to the free-agent 
signing period that began July 1, 1994. The bigger fine, a $1 
million hit, was for entering into a side deal with Stevens and his 
agent, the late Richard Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devils matched the Blues' four-year, $17.5 million offer  
sheet signed by Stevens on July 4, 1994 -- then the highest ever 
made to a defenseman and $7 million more than the Devils' last 
offer. The fallout from the side deal was New Jersey also had to 
paid Stevens $500,000 the Blues had owed as deferred compensation 
arising from Stevens' signing bonus from his one season with the 
team in 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the deal, the Blues were relieved of their  
compensation obligation if another team signed Stevens on the same 
terms as their offer sheet. Lamoriello said the Blues' new 
management allowed the NHL to look into their records early last 
year and several documents relating to the tampering were found, 
including an offer sheet sent to the agent prior to July 1.

	``I guess if you're in the stock world, doing these types of

<P>
	Stevens was never asked to testify in hearings. He said Sunday  
that he didn't believe tampering occurred, but Lamoriello suggested 
that Bennett handled all of the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettman's ruling comes more than five months after a July 27,  
1998, hearing involving the Blues and Devils. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues and Devils were at odds throughout the early 1990s,  
with Stevens the focal point. St. Louis pried Stevens away from 
Washington by signing him to a free agent deal in 1990, then lost 
their captain to New Jersey after only one season as compensation 
for signing Devils free agent Brendan Shanahan. The Blues' 
determination to get him back apparently led to the tampering. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation, dormant for a long time, heated up again in  
the last year after disclosures to the Devils from a former member

<HEADLINE> Nuns Pray Over Pope's Mo. Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- St. Louis nuns are appealing to a higher  
authority to get good weather for the upcoming visit of Pope John 
Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
	Local weather is always unpredictable, even more so during  
winter. The pope is visiting town Jan. 26-27. At the same time last 
year it was about 60 degrees but just last week a New Year's Day 
winter storm dumped 8 inches of snow and sleet. By Tuesday, things 
were still a mess. 
</P>
<P>
	In hopes of avoiding meteorological chaos later this month,  
Monsignor Richard Stika last year asked about 150 contemplative 
nuns, who spend virtually their entire day in prayer, to pitch in. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked them to pray for two intentions,'' the papal visit  
coordinator said Tuesday. ``The first was for the pope's health, 
and the second was for good weather so when he and his people come 
to St. Louis, it's a joyful visit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With weather-related troubles still all around, Stika hopes the  
prayers are answered. 
</P>
<P>
	Most schools remained closed, with all but main roads nearly  
impassable. Slippery spots on the interstate highways continued to 
cause wrecks and snarl traffic. The overnight low reached minus 15 
degrees in the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Another winter storm just before or during the visit would  
worsen expected traffic problems and could even prevent the plane 
carrying the pope from landing at Lambert Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Papal visit organizers say the weather is simply a factor beyond  
their control. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are two things we don't know,'' St. Louis Police Chief  
Ron Henderson said. ``We don't know how many people are going to 
show up, and we don't know the weather.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two-day visit includes three large indoor events: a youth  
rally at the Kiel Center, a mass involving an estimated 95,000 
people at the Trans World Dome, and a prayer service at the St. 
Louis Cathedral Basilica. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are also four major outdoor events: a youth march from  
the Gateway Arch to the Kiel Center rally, and three parades. John 
Paul II will be riding in the enclosed Popemobile, though foul 
weather could cause problems for the expected hundreds of thousands 
of people lining parade routes.

<HEADLINE> Grammy Nominations a Female Affair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Grammy voters saluted a spectrum of  
styles this year -- from country pop to introspective rock to 
empowering hip-hop -- as women dominated the major album, record and 
song categories. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauryn Hill, whose solo debut ``The Miseducation of Lauryn  
Hill'' was met with critical and popular acclaim, received the most 
nominations Tuesday with 10, including best new artist and producer 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill will compete against a nearly all-female field -- including  
Madonna, Sheryl Crow and Shania Twain -- for album of the year. 
Garbage, with lead singer Shirley Manson, also was nominated in the 
category. 
</P>
<P>
	Grammy voters also favored women for record of the year. Twain's  
``You're Still the One'' will compete against Celine Dion's ``My 
Heart Will Go On,'' the Brandy &AMP; Monica duet ``The Boy Is Mine,'' 
and Madonna's ``Ray of Light.'' The sole male entry, the Goo Goo 
Dolls, was nominated for ``Iris.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year, eight of the 10 Grammy nods for record and album of  
the year went to female artists, doubling last year's nomination 
totals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really happy women are getting a chance to break  
through,'' said Natalie Imbruglia, whose single ``Torn'' was 
nominated for best female pop vocal and her album ``Left of the 
Middle'' for pop album. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, women also broke new ground on Broadway, winning  
for the first time Tony Awards in direction -- Julie Taymor, for her 
work on the Disney musical ``The Lion King'' and Garry Hynes for 
the Irish drama ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Women are taking over,'' said Diane Warren, whose ``I Don't  
Want to Miss a Thing'' was nominated for song of the year. ``It 
does seem to be the day of the female artists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 41st annual Grammy Awards will be presented Feb. 24 at the  
Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles during a three-hour ceremony on 
CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 460 nominations in 95 categories were such eclectic  
choices as shock rocker Marilyn Manson, Andy Griffith, former 
President Jimmy Carter and pop stalwarts Boy George and Cyndi 
Lauper. 
</P>
<P>
	Diversity also marked the best new artist category. Australian  
pop sensation Imbruglia, teen idols the Backstreet Boys, opera 
singer Andrea Bocelli, the country trio Dixie Chicks and Hill will 
compete. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian chanteuse Dion may have sung on two of the top-selling  
albums of 1998 -- the ``Titanic'' soundtrack and her own ``Let's 
Talk About Love'' -- but she earned just four nominations.

<HEADLINE> Study: Women Using 'Date Rape Drug' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Nearly 6 percent of a group of sexually active  
girls and young women reported taking the drug Rohypnol 
deliberately, despite warnings that it can make them vulnerable to 
rape, according to a study. 
</P>
<P>
	Rohypnol, or ``roofies,'' is known as a ``date rape drug''  
because of cases in which women were assaulted after someone 
slipped it into their drink. Users have likened one tablet to 
drinking a 12-pack of beer. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at the University of Texas questioned 904 women ages  
14 to 26 who visited a Galveston family planning clinic, and found 
that 5.9 percent -- or 53 -- said they had taken flunitrazepam, the 
scientific name for Rohypnol, at least once. Six reported taking it 
more than 20 times. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was reported Tuesday in the journal Pediatrics.  
</P>
<P>
	The researchers and other experts said they suspect women try  
the drug because it is cheap, produces a drunken-like high and 
heightens the effects of other narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The media has been very clear about the dangers of this drug  
and yet teen-age girls, particularly the ones we studied, when they 
party and someone offers them something, they accept,'' said Dr. 
Vaughn Rickert. ``They are really leaving themselves open for 
assault.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Ron Charles, a professor at the University of Texas  
Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, questioned the survey's 
accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I doubt that many people actually know what Rohypnol is. There  
are many street drugs that can be perceived as Rohypnol,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rohypnol is illegal in the United States but prescribed in  
Mexico and dozens of other countries for severe sleep disorders. In 
Mexican border towns, a tablet can sell for less than $1, meaning 
young people in Texas can get Rohypnol cheaply. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement agencies seized 194 pills in Texas in 1992, and  
41,600 in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Trial To Begin on Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Split even among themselves, Senate GOP  
leaders are struggling for agreement with Democrats on how to 
proceed when President Clinton's impeachment trial begins Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond establishing a date to formally open the historic perjury  
and obstruction of justice trial, nearly everything else is 
unsettled -- from whether there will be witnesses to the length of 
the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has to be done not only expeditiously, but fairly,'' Senate  
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said after meeting Tuesday 
with Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle and Chief Justice William 
H. Rehnquist, who will preside over the first impeachment trial of 
a president in 130 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Some two weeks after a House vote made Clinton just the second  
impeached president in history, the 106th Congress takes its seats 
today with the trial at the top of the agenda. In the House, one of 
the first orders of business will be to reappoint the 13 House 
Republicans who will serve as prosecutors in the Senate trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle told reporters Tuesday that starting the trial without a  
defined plan for proceeding would be an ``invitation to a prolonged 
process that would take weeks if not months, probably months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart said the uncertainty  
leaves the president's lawyers ``in the position of preparing for 
all eventualities. In general, we'd like to know which direction 
we're going in, but we understand the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House signaled this week it would present an  
aggressive defense if the Senate conducted a full-blown trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Fresh criticism surfaced among Republicans on Tuesday over the  
bipartisan plan for a proceeding as short as a week -- a proposal 
mostly favored by Democrats looking for a vote to censure the 
president rather than remove him from office. The likelihood of a 
longer trial, meanwhile, grew -- with some senators predicting it 
could last well into next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not at all worried about a two-to-three week process that  
could take us into mid-February,'' said Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, 
a member of the GOP leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	The uncertainty persisted as the Senate's senior Democrat,  
Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, issued the first indication that 
any of the Senate's 45 Democrats could vote to remove Clinton from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	On the final vote on the articles of impeachment, ``I could go  
either way based on the evidence as I've seen it or heard it. And 
I've followed it pretty closely,'' he said in an interview on the 
C-Span cable TV network. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Senate sources who spoke on condition of anonymity,  
Lott said in closed-door meetings during the day that following 
Thursday's largely ceremonial events, he wants opening arguments 
presented the following Monday by representatives of the House and 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig said he envisioned giving each side three or four days to  
present its evidence. Each could then submit a list of witnesses 
for the Senate to subpoena, subject to a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	But Daschle, who agreed the ceremonial opening was likely for  
Thursday, told reporters his preference was for no witnesses. He 
added he wants a vote on censuring the president after an expected 
rejection of the articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	But Daschle told reporters at days' end that neither he nor Lott  
would be presenting formal proposals in separate closed-door 
caucuses of Senate Democrats and Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the 13 House Republicans who will act as prosecutors  
in the Senate trial gave their take on the debate during a meeting 
Tuesday night, the eve of Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde's 
meeting on logistics with Lott. 
</P>
<P>
	No consensus was reached on just whom to call as a witness, said  
Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla. But he estimated that the House would 
need two or three weeks in the trial just to present its case 
against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved articles of impeachment on Dec. 19, alleging  
that Clinton committed perjury and obstructed justice as part of a 
months-long campaign to cover up his sexual relationship with 
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.

<HEADLINE> Reeves Back in Control of Falcons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- Sounding like nervous parents, the Atlanta  
Falcons hope coach Dan Reeves will agree to work upstairs during 
the playoffs instead of the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
	Just three weeks after heart bypass surgery, Reeves made it  
clear Tuesday he is back in full control of his team. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL's coach of the year held a briefing for the media,  
directed a 2 1/2-hour practice at the Georgia Dome and made plans to 
be on the sideline for Saturday's divisional playoff game against 
the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	Several players said they wish Reeves would work from the press  
box coaching booth instead of subjecting himself to possible injury 
on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always nice to see him coming off the field and see him  
before you go in there for a series,'' quarterback Chris Chandler 
said. ``There's no doubt that having him on the field is just kind 
of comforting for me. 
</P>
<P>
	``But with what's going on with him and the risk factor of being  
down on the sideline, it's best that he probably not be down 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback Ray Buchanan echoed those sentiments.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be very emotional to have him back. At the same  
time, Dan has to be very careful with his heart condition in a 
playoff atmosphere,'' Buchanan said. ``Some of the players said 
they'd rather have him up in the press box. We can feel his 
presence whenever we go out on the field, even if he's not there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, who underwent surgery on Dec. 14, already has returned  
to the hospital once with an accelerated heartbeat, apparently 
because he tried to rush his recovery. But he isn't worried about 
another setback. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctors tell me to go be myself,'' he said. ``My heart's  
in good shape. I'm not going to go out there screaming and 
everything. Well, maybe sometimes. But hopefully I will be a little 
bit more under control ... and do the things I've always done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves missed the final two games of the regular season for the  
NFC West champion Falcons (14-2). 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, he began viewing some film and sat in on meetings  
with the players and coaches. But defensive coordinator Rich 
Brooks, who served as acting head coach, continued to run the team 
in practice while Reeves watched from his office. 
</P>
<P>
	When Reeves strode to the podium Tuesday for his weekly news  
conference -- a duty handled by Brooks since the operation -- it was 
apparent things were back to normal. The only question remaining: 
Where will Reeves work during the playoff game? 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is to try to be on the sideline,'' he said. ``I think  
I'll have a better idea after we go through three days of practice 
-- how much energy I have at practice, how much I'll be able to 
stand up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves and his team escaped the unseasonably cold temperatures  
in Atlanta by practicing indoors at the Georgia Dome. He said it 
was easier to concentrate in warmer surroundings, but the move also 
allowed him to take part without fear of illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing a gray sweatshirt and black sweatpants, Reeves casually  
strolled around the field during most of the practice, blowing his 
whistle and barking instructions. The only concession to his 
condition came during individual drills, when he sat down on the 
bench for about 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm better than I thought I would be,'' he said. ``It was  
great to be back on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves received a clean bill of health during an examination  
Monday, although he is still taking blood thinner medication for 
his recovery. He is working out twice a day for 15 minutes on a 
treadmill, which has helped his energy level. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you think about what he's gone through, it's amazing that  
he's planning to join us as quickly as it has been,'' Chandler 
said. ``When you think about all we've got to do is play a football 
game and he went through major heart surgery, I think it gives us a 
lot of motivation.''

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Outfielder Signs With L.A. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwanese outfielder Chen Chin-feng signed  
with the Los Angeles Dodgers today, making him the country's second 
player to play professional baseball in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen reportedly signed a seven-year, $600,000 contract -- four  
times what he had been promised by the scandal-marred Taiwan Major 
League. In 1975, Taiwan's Tan Hsin-min played briefly in San 
Francisco's farm system. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Zduriencik, director of international scouting for the  
Dodgers, was at a news conference with Chen to announce the 
signing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a fast runner and has strength,'' said Zduriencik, who  
expects Chen to be with a Dodgers minor league affilitate this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen starred in the world championships and Asian Games last  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the world championships in Italy, he set a record with home  
runs in four consecutive games. Last month, he homered off South 
Korea's Chan Ho Park, a starting pitcher for Los Angeles, while 
batting .444 in the Asian Games at Bangkok. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taiwan Major League has been marred by gambling scandals,  
with several star players arrested for throwing games. 
</P>
<P>
	Before being drafted by the military for two years of compulsory  
service, Chen had agreed to join the Taiwan Major League after he 
got out -- but the offer from the Dodgers was too good to refuse. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taiwanese professional league has since been marred by  
scandals as several star players were arrested for throwing games 
to help gamblers win their bets.

<TEXT>
<P>
	KRANJSKA GORA, Slovenia (AP) -- Patrick Holzer of Italy scored  
his first World Cup victory in seven years today, beating the 
dominant Austrian skiers in the giant slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	Holzer was sixth after the first run, then skied a flawless  
second run to win the race in 2 minutes, 14.91 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Austrian Christian Mayer, who was leading after the first run,  
finished second in 2:15.15. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Austrian, Hans Knauss, skied two solid runs down the  
steep and icy hill to finish third, 31 hundredths of a second 
behind Holzer. 
</P>
<P>
	A third Austrian, Benjamin Raich, finished fourth.  
</P>
<P>
	The biggest surprise of the day was the 20th place finish by  
overall World Cup leader Hermann Maier. He has four races this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Holzer had not won since 1992 when he captured a super-G in

<HEADLINE> Abortion Clinic Sues Online Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Fla. (AP) -- An abortion clinic owner is suing two  
online services she says provided anti-abortion activists with 
personal information about clinic visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit filed this week in U.S. District Court in Orlando  
names CompuServe and TML Information Services, which abortion foes 
allegedly used to get names and addresses from license plate 
numbers of cars driven to the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit seeking unspecified damages also seeks damages an  
injunction to halt the activities of abortion opponents who watch 
the Aware Woman Center for Choice clinic every day from a house 
across the street. 
</P>
<P>
	``Heaven knows we've been intimidated many, many times,'' clinic  
owner Patricia Baird Windle said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-abortion activists have been able to find out who visits  
the clinic by writing down or videotaping the license plate numbers 
of vehicles there. Using the tag numbers, they find out car owners' 
names and addresses from the online services, which buy the 
information from state motor vehicle offices, according to the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	After visiting the clinic, people have received letters from  
anti-abortion activists. One doctor had a picture of himself in a 
car wreck sent to his patients. In another case, anti-abortion 
activists found the identity of a woman who had visited the clinic 
and followed her to a hospital and also trailed her in a department 
store, according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-abortion activist Meredith Raney, the lead defendant in the  
lawsuit, wouldn't comment on the lawsuit or whether he used online 
services to get information about clinic visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	CompuServe spokeswoman Daphne Kent said she wasn't aware of the  
lawsuit and couldn't comment on it. The Columbus, Ohio-based 
company, recently purchased by America Online, has since stopped 
providing the information, said Roy Lucas, an attorney for the 
clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	TML Information Services no longer allows Raney to use its  
services, he said. There was no directory listing for the Forest 
Hill, N.Y. company.

<HEADLINE> Avery Dennison Accused of Stealing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A Taiwanese company accused Avery Dennison  
Corp. of stealing trade secrets that helped the adhesives 
manufacturer get a foothold in Asia, an attorney said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Four Pillars Enterprises Co. is seeking $262 million in damages  
through lawsuits and administrative complaints filed in Taiwan and 
China. 
</P>
<P>
	An Avery Dennison spokesman said the lawsuit was an attempt to  
divert attention from an economic espionage case against Four 
Pillars that is scheduled for trial in March. 
</P>
<P>
	That criminal case accuses Four Pillars chairman P.Y. Young and  
his daughter, Sally Yang, of buying proprietary information from an 
Avery Dennison researcher, said Steven Fink, a spokesman for Avery 
Dennison. 
</P>
<P>
	Pasadena-based Avery Dennison began discussions about launching  
a joint venture in Asia, but allegedly its real intent was to 
acquire information, said Nancy Luque, an attorney for Four 
Pillars. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies discussed a possible joint venture from 1987  
to 1994. During that time, Avery Dennison photographed Four 
Pillars' proprietary machinery and used the information to open its 
own adhesives factory in China, Ms. Luque said. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery Dennison built its own plant in China after breaking off  
the joint-venture negotiations in 1994, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the issue is entry to Asia, which is a daunting task  
for any company,'' Ms. Luque said. ``Culturally, I think it's that 
you have a culture of businesses operating on the honor system. Not 
that there weren't documents, but I think this company got 
blindsided by an American company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fink disputed that depiction., however. ``It's our contention  
that the lawsuit is nothing more than a blatant attempt to distract 
attention from Pillars' own criminal conduct,'' said Fink. ``I 
think what they're trying to do is put up a smoke screen, pure and 
simple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avery Dennison reported $3.3 billion in revenues in 1997 from  
sales in 89 countries. It manufactures a variety of adhesive 
products including self-adhesive stamps, bar-code labels and 
bandage tape. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Four Pillars' customers are in Asia, although it sells a  
small amount of tape in the United States, Ms. Luque said.

<HEADLINE> Rehearing Denied in Tobacco Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- A former smoker who won -- and then  
lost -- a $750,000 verdict against the nation's third largest 
cigarette maker says he plans to continue his appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	An appeals court in Tallahassee on Dec. 31 denied Grady Carter's  
motion to rehear its earlier decision voiding his judgment against 
Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. The ruling was made public Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of expected,'' said Carter, 68. ``We are going to  
take it on to the (Florida) Supreme Court. We're just going to keep 
plodding along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carter sued Brown &AMP; Williamson in 1996, blaming the company for  
the lung cancer he developed after smoking for 44 years. A jury in 
Jacksonville ruled that the cigarettes were a defective product and 
that their makers were negligent for not warning people of the 
danger. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict was only the second time in 40 years of anti-smoking  
litigation that a tobacco company was ordered to pay damages. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 1st District Court of Appeal voided the award in June,  
ruling that the lawsuit ``was filed more than four years after 
Grady Carter knew or should have known... that he had a

<HEADLINE> Annual Fund Tables Tell Many Tales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Like sports fans, many avid mutual-fund  
investors have a special fondness for statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	They rely on quarterly, monthly, weekly or daily tables  
measuring fund performance and other developments in the fund 
industry to serve as guideposts in their personal investment 
planning. 
</P>
<P>
	Experienced fund-watchers don't just focus on who's leading the  
league in the performance race. They monitor which fund groups are 
doing well, and which are not, and keep an eye on longer-term 
figures as well as the what-have-you-done-for-me-lately numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	In this box-score reading, the primary purpose usually isn't to  
find new funds to buy or sell. Most fund fanciers have long since 
realized that they need to give funds plenty of time -- several 
years, in many cases -- to try to achieve the desired results. 
</P>
<P>
	But even if they have no trading plans, activist fund investors  
like to stay informed. 
</P>
<P>
	Right about now, stats-minded investors are confronted with the  
annual fund performance tables for 1998, which take the measure of 
a year full of surprises, confusion and conflicting developments. 
</P>
<P>
	Let's take a look over their shoulders, and see if we can pick  
up a few highlights: 
</P>
<P>
	DIVERSITY OF RESULTS. On any given day, it may seem as though  
all stocks, and all stock markets around the world for that matter, 
move up or down together. But a glance at the fund averages for 
1998 shows how much the results actually vary from one type of fund 
to another and one part of the world to another. 
</P>
<P>
	In the year just completed, growth funds were up strongly, but  
small-cap funds sagged. Science and technology soared, while 
natural resources slumped. Europe was as hot as Asia was cold. 
</P>
<P>
	From this, it would seem logical to infer that staying  
diversified is as important as ever. 
</P>
<P>
	THE MIGHTY S&AMP;P 500. Index funds based on that  
blue-chip-dominated market index just keep rolling along, 
clobbering most of the managed competition once again in '98. Why, 
the gain posted by S&AMP;P 500 index funds was about double the return 
posted by all stock funds as a group. 
</P>
<P>
	But not everybody lost that battle. Glance at the performance  
table for the 25 largest funds, and you'll notice that the biggest 
of them all, Fidelity Magellan, outperformed the second largest, 
Vanguard Index 500, by several percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	That provides an interesting plot twist as the fast-growing  
Vanguard 500 fund bids to overtake Magellan, which has been closed 
to most new accounts for more than a year, for the top spot in 
asset size. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Stansky, Magellan's manager, has sharply reduced the  
number of stocks in the fund's portfolio, from more than 500 to 
about 350 at last report. Fidelity-watcher Eric Kobren says several 
funds that Fidelity has closed in the past year to 18 months seem 
to have benefited by that move. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fidelity denies that the funds' closings had anything to do  
with them becoming more concentrated and focused, but it certainly 
didn't hurt,'' Kobren writes in his Fidelity Insight newsletter. 
``Cash flows are much more predictable, allowing managers to better 
strategize their buys and sells.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ONE BAD YEAR CAN REALLY HURT. Real-estate funds had been racking  
up generous double-digit gains for several years until 1998 came 
along, socking them with a big setback. Now their five-year results 
are down around the levels of the bond funds. 
</P>
<P>
	BUT TIME STILL MATTERS. The past year's winners, for all their  
current dazzle, may not be the best funds to own. Consider utility 
funds, which posted gains in '98 that were about three times as big 
as the modest advance managed by financial services funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, financial services has been a much better place to  
be over the past five years, benefiting from the boom on Wall 
Street, while most types of utilities have struggled with slow 
growth and a changing regulatory climate. 
</P>
<P>
	NOTHING GOOD ABOUT GOLD. Precious metals funds had another bad  
year in 1998. So what else is new? They have been losing ground for 
almost 20 years now, since the price of gold peaked in early 1980 
at about three times where it stands today.

<HEADLINE> Honesty Urged for Kids With HIV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Children and teens who are infected with the AIDS  
virus should be told, the nation's foremost group of pediatricians 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's better to approach it in a controlled fashion rather than  
have a 12-year-old overhear it on the ward -- `The child with AIDS 
in bed No. 3,''' said Dr. Robert Pantell of the University of 
California at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Pantell is one of the authors of a policy statement from the  
American Academy of Pediatrics published in the January issue of 
the journal Pediatrics. 
</P>
<P>
	The 55,000-member organization recommended frankness toward  
HIV-infected children. It said doctors should try to work with the 
patient's parents to convince them their child should know the 
truth. 
</P>
<P>
	But it stopped short of saying doctors should tell the child  
over the parents' objections, unless the patient is a sexually 
active teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	The academy said the best way to tell the child is with both  
doctors and parents present. But it acknowledged some parents may 
want the doctor to break the news. 
</P>
<P>
	It said some doctors have often bowed to the wishes of parents  
who hope to keep youngsters from knowing they have HIV. The reasons 
include fear that their youngsters will lose their will to live, 
become angry with parents who infected them or disclose the 
information outside the family. 
</P>
<P>
	The academy has not previously taken a position on the issue.  
Doctors said the problem is becoming more serious as the number of 
youngsters with HIV grows and they live longer. 
</P>
<P>
	As of a year ago, there were more than 8,000 reported cases of  
AIDS in children under 13. The vast majority got the infection from 
their mothers at birth, and well over half remain alive, doctors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement cautioned that only preliminary research has been  
done on the effect of telling youngsters about their condition. But 
the pediatricians said an initial study shows that those who are 
told have higher self-esteem and parents who are candid with 
children are less likely to be depressed. 
</P>
<P>
	Health-care professionals who did not participate in writing the  
statement largely agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Time and time again we have seen that we think we are sparing  
the children from something and all we have done is make it more 
mysterious and more frightening because we were unwilling to talk 
about it,'' said Dr. Thomas DeStefani, chairman of pediatrics at 
Loyola University Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Hermann Mendez, a professor of pediatrics at the State  
University of New York at Brooklyn, echoed the statement's authors 
in saying that the time and manner of disclosure should match the 
patient's personality and readiness to know the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the child is unable to keep information that belongs in the  
family within the family, this could result in harm to the 
family,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said that teen-agers, who may be sexually active,  
must be told the truth to prevent spread of the infection. It said 
preschoolers are usually interested mainly in what will happen in 
their immediate future and don't necessarily need to hear the whole 
diagnosis.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Faring Well Despite Cold / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- Kansas' winter wheat crop appears for the  
most part to have survived the cold weather that engulfed much of 
the state the past two weeks, agriculture experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Fears for the state's winter wheat were especially acute going  
into the winter because the unusually warm fall had spurred a 
growth spurt. Plants more than 6 inches tall don't have the same 
capacity as smaller plants to harden and tolerate very cold 
conditions, said Rollie Sears, a wheat breeder at Kansas State 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	But the gradually lowering temperatures that preceded the recent  
cold snaps and the insulating cover of snow and ice helped protect 
much of the crop, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The key to the crop's survival lies in a plant's condition 1  
inch below ground, making soil temperatures a critical factor. Snow 
and ice act as a barrier, keeping soil temperature higher than 
exposed ground, and help the crop better tolerate the cold, Sears 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In its weekly crop weather report Monday, Kansas Agricultural  
Statistics reported that winter wheat remained in mostly good to 
excellent condition, just a slight downturn from conditions at the 
beginning of December. 
</P>
<P>
	KAS reported that there appears to be little freeze damage,  
despite the sharp drop in temperatures from daytime highs in the 
low 50s to recent highs in the single digits. The agency warned, 
though, that it is too soon to assess the potential effect of the 
cold on the condition of the wheat crop. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Kansas Association of Wheat Growers has not received  
reports of widespread freeze damage from the recent winter weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat in central Kansas fields around Wichita and Salina had not  
grown as big as crops in Great Bend and farther west, said Brett 
Myers of the Kansas Association of Wheat Growers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were needing cold weather to slow it down,'' Myers said.  
</P>
<P>
	Sears also welcomed the cold weather, saying it kills aphids and  
diseases like leaf rust and stem rust that are problems in the 
spring. ``Actually, the cold is probably helping us in the long 
run,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Martin, a wheat breeder at the Kansas State University  
research center in Hays, said damage in that area has been fairly 
minor and limited to some plants being frozen back. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be my guess the crop will look pretty rough out there  
for a while ... but for the most part it is OK,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Soil temperatures at Hays got down only to the low 20s, well  
above the 5 or 6 degrees that would cause winter kill, Martin said. 
Also soils that go into the winter with good moisture, as happened 
this year, withstand low temperatures better than dry, powdery 
soils. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Kansas State University nursery in Hays, the less hardy  
spring wheat breeding stock burnt back to the ground. But even that 
probably survived, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of our (winter) wheat varieties can stand a week or so of  
real cold weather around zero,'' Martin said. ``When we get a 
couple of weeks of it, then start worrying about soil 
temperatures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The kind of damage most often seen in Kansas usually occurs when  
the crop begins greening in February or March, and then is hit by a 
cold snap. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have a long way to go,'' Martin said.

<HEADLINE> Coal Industry Is in Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, W.Va., (AP) -- These days, Mr. Peabody's coal train  
is hauling it for Lehman Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	Peabody Holding Co., the nation's largest coal producer, wound  
up in the hands of the venerable New York investment house last 
year as part of a complex sale of Britain's Energy Group PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	Startling as it was, the $2.3 billion sale of Peabody to Lehman  
Merchant Banking Partners II was just one transaction in a wave of 
mergers and acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're seeing a lot of foreign investment, a lot of banks  
getting involved in the coal business,'' said industry analyst John 
Feddock of Marshall Miller &AMP; Associates in Bluefield, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent transactions in the coal industry have involved a change  
in ownership for as much as a third of the country's coal 
production. Some other examples: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Arch Coal Inc. of St. Louis, created in 1997 through a merger  
of Arch Mineral Corp. and Ashland Coal Inc., paid $1.7 billion in 
June to acquire the domestic coal operations of Atlantic Richfield, 
becoming the country's No. 2 producer. 
</P>
<P>
	-- AEI Resources Inc. of Ashland, Ky., a company that did not  
exist in 1997, bought up Zeigler Coal Holding Co., and some 11 
properties from Cyprus-Amax Coal Co. in four states. Coupled with 
other purchases, what was formerly a regional producer known as 
Addington Enterprises has become the fifth-largest producer in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The DuPont Co. sold its 50 percent interest in CONSOL Coal  
Group, including Consolidation Coal Co., to its partner, RheinBraun 
of Germany. CONSOL formerly was the third-largest producer behind 
Cyprus-Amax. 
</P>
<P>
	So many such transactions took place last year that a key trade  
publication, Financial Times' Energy World, dubbed it ``the great 
coal sell-off of 1998.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Various analysts have said the transactions have been spurred in  
part by low prices worldwide for all forms of energy, including 
oil. Oil companies that bought up coal reserves in the 1970s and 
1980s have begun to see that the two industries do not always mesh 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	Others believe that some companies are positioning themselves  
for the coming deregulation of the electric utility industry in the 
United States. An international global warming treaty signed by the 
Clinton Administration earlier this year will put increasing 
pressure on companies, like electric utilities, that burn fossil 
fuels like coal.

<HEADLINE> Ryan Secured Hall Spot As a Ranger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Before Nolan Ryan joined the Texas  
Rangers in 1989, he was known as one of the game's hardest 
throwers, a guy who could strike out 15 or toss a no-hitter every 
time he took the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	It was during his five years in Arlington, however, where his  
reputation -- and stats -- really soared. 
</P>
<P>
	There with the Rangers, he reached unheard of milestones such as  
5,000 strikeouts and seven no-hitters, as well as winning his 300th 
games. And there, Ryan became revered as one of baseball's all-time 
greats. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan officially joined that group Tuesday by being elected to  
the Hall of Fame on his first try along with fellow rookie 
candidates George Brett and Robin Yount. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never really viewed myself in that light,'' Ryan said from  
his hometown of Alvin, Texas. ``It probably wasn't until the last 
three or four years of my career that I gave it much thought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's obvious which teams Brett and Yount will be identified with  
on their plaques because they played their entire careers in one 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan, however, won a World Series on the New York Mets, threw  
four no-hitters for the California Angels and became the majors' 
strikeout king with the Houston Astros before coming to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ryan said Tuesday he'd like to be remembered for what he did  
as a Ranger, so he'll have a ``T'' on his cap when he's inducted in 
Cooperstown, N.Y., on July 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that brought my career and my presence in the game to  
another level,'' said Ryan, who seemingly defied nature by 
remaining a power pitcher at 46. ``I feel like those were very 
special years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rangers president Tom Schieffer said Ryan's last five seasons  
set him apart. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think when Nolan came to Texas he was a superstar and when  
he left he was a legend,'' Schieffer said. ``He came to epitomize 
everything that was good in baseball, all the values that are 
enduring and why the people hold the game with so much affection. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't think of anybody you'd rather have in the Hall of  
Fame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan had the most strikeouts in a career (5,714) and in a season  
(383), the most no-hitters and the most seasons (27). He even holds 
the record for most records (53 held or shared). 
</P>
<P>
	He almost set another mark Tuesday, but came just short of Tom  
Seaver's record for being named on the highest percentage of 
ballots. Ryan was named on 491 of 497 for 98.79 percent, leaving 
him only one vote shy of eclipsing his former teammate's total. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who didn't voted against Ryan likely held against him the  
things that kept him from being fully appreciated earlier in his 
career: the most walks (2,795), a career record (324-292) barely 
above .500, no Cy Young Awards and only one World Series 
appearance, made as a second-year reliever. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ryan was the most dominant pitcher of his era -- and that  
spanned several eras. He struck out everyone from A to Z -- from 
Hank Aaron to Paul Zuvella, actually -- and is the only pitcher to 
have fanned home-run heroes Roger Maris, Mark McGwire and Sammy 
Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
	Attendance was higher at games he pitched because fans knew that  
Ryan on the mound could mean magic. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he was on, forget it,'' said eight-time NL batting  
champion Tony Gwynn. ``You talk about guys being tough. When he was 
throwing the fastball, change and curve for strikes, it was a 
victory just getting the bat on the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reggie Jackson described trying to hit Ryan's 100 mph heater as  
being ``like eating coffee with a fork.'' Jackson also said Ryan 
was the only pitcher he feared. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not because he could get me out, but because he could kill  
me,'' Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan broke into the majors with the Mets in 1966, a year out of  
high school. In fact, he left a minor league ballpark with a 
no-hitter in progress in the sixth inning when he got the call from 
the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan fanned the first batter he ever faced in the majors,  
Atlanta pitcher Pat Jarvis, and was on the Miracle Mets that won 
the 1969 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Mets tired of waiting for him to develop and sent him to  
California in December 1971 in a deal for Jim Fregosi. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan won 19 and struck out 329 his first season as an Angel. The  
next year he threw his first no-hitter, won 21 and set the 
strikeout record. He had two more no-hitters in '74 and tied Sandy 
Koufax's record with a fourth in '75. 
</P>
<P>
	But after the Angels won their first division title in '79,  
general manager Buzzie Bavasi said Ryan was nothing more than a 
.500 pitcher and let him go as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Houston Astros snapped up the native of nearby Alvin and  
made him baseball's first million dollar man. In nine seasons, Ryan 
helped Houston win two division titles, threw his fifth no-hitter, 
broke Walter Johnson's strikeout record and became the first to fan 
4,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Ryan led the NL in strikeouts in 1988, Astros owner  
John McMullen thought Ryan was too old and wanted to cut his 
salary. Ryan instead took a hike up Interstate 45 to Arlington and 
the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really thought I'd retire in an Astros uniform,'' Ryan said  
Tuesday. ``But I also thought I'd retire long before (1993).'' 
</P>
<P>
	He signed a one-year deal with Texas, but stayed for five. In  
that time, from age 42 to 46, Ryan made the baseball world realize 
he was a one-of-a-kind wonder who had to be seen to be believed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think changing teams and changing leagues probably ignited  
another burner somewhere,'' said Tom Grieve, Texas' general manager 
during the Ryan years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although he had nothing to prove, I think he wanted to prove  
that he could still be exactly what he turned out to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan gave Texas something special every season: 301 strikeouts,  
including No. 5,000, in '89; sixth no-hitter, 300th victory and 
11th strikeout title in '90; seventh no-hitter in '91; 23rd 
straight year of 100 strikeouts in '92 and still hitting 94 mph 
during his 27th season in '93. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing you marvel at is that he never varied his style,''  
Grieve said. ``He didn't develop a knuckleball or go to being a 
curveball pitcher. He went to the end the way he pitched at the 
beginning. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got my doubts anybody ever has or ever will have that  
velocity and that dominance when they're 46. It's a freak of 
nature. He was just a physical specimen who doesn't come around 
often and possibly never will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	These days, Ryan is under a personal services contract with the  
Rangers, but it doesn't take much of his time. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranching and owning a bank do. So does his six-year term on the  
Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission. He also recently bought a 
minor league team that his oldest son, Reid, will run.

<HEADLINE> AP Corrects Olympic Bribes Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Associated Press story Dec. 30 about the  
president of the U.S. Olympic Committee promising closer oversight 
of the selection process for host cities misstated one detail of 
the previous president's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Helmick stepped down as president in 1991 after a  
USOC-ordered report found he had accepted retainers from various 
clients having a business relationship with the USOC and that those 
fees ``repeatedly violated conflict of interest provisions of the 
USOC bylaws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the AP story wrongly stated that the organizations that  
paid fees to Helmick included sports federations ``connected with 
the Olympic community.'' One of the organizations was the U.S. Golf 
Federation, which at the time did not have Olympic recognition but 
was seeking to obtain it. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP report also erroneously reported that Salt Lake City was  
awarded the Winter Games in 1989. It won the games in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Orioles May Play Games in Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Cubans welcome a plan that could lead to more U.S.  
money, mail and baseball heading their way. 
</P>
<P>
	Especially the baseball.  
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of a visit by the Baltimore Orioles would be the  
first trip by a major league team to this baseball-mad island in 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``How could I not go? I'll be one of the first ones in the  
park,'' said Roman Garcia, wearing a New York Yankees cap at a 
baseball discussion that takes place daily in Havana's Central 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal announced by President Clinton on Tuesday would  
allow more Americans to send money to Cubans, offer direct mail 
service, expand direct charter flights and possibly let the Orioles 
play in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba's state-run news media mentioned the news only briefly at  
midday Tuesday. Foreign Ministry spokesman Alejandro Gonzalez said 
he would comment only after the proposal had been analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	The baseball exchange is aimed at easing the plight of Cubans  
while maintaining sanctions against the Castro government. The 
measures follow an initiative by Pope John Paul II, who visited 
Cuba a year ago this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration said the games will be allowed only  
if profits go to humanitarian assistance in Cuba and not to Fidel 
Castro's government. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles are expected to send a group to Cuba as early as  
this week to negotiate arrangements for the exhibition games, with 
one in Baltimore and one in Cuba. 
</P>

	``Baseball is a wonderful medium in bringing people together.  
This has been demonstrated time and again in a variety of contexts. 
In that spirit, the Orioles welcome the opportunity to play a part 
in the efforts to improve relations between the two peoples,'' 
Orioles owner Peter Angelos said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a fount of major league baseball talent, Cuba has been  
largely isolated from U.S. professional baseball since shortly 
after Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution. The U.S. government has 
blocked major league visits to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	The last major league team to visit Cuba was the Brooklyn  
Dodgers, who trained in Havana in 1947. In 1960, an exhibition game 
between the Orioles and Cincinnati Reds was canceled. In 1975-78, a 
number of major league teams were invited to Cuba but were barred 
from playing there by the commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
	A few defectors -- most recently Orlando Hernandez of the Yankees  
-- have made their way to the major leagues, and Cubans have played 
against Latin American major leaguers in games against Dominican 
and other winter league teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cuba is a country that has ballplayers growing like grass,''  
said Garcia, 47, an unemployed driver and former amateur baseball 
player. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, a dozen men arguing baseball said they kept up with  
the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a series of seven games, I would go for the Orioles,''  
said Heriberto Portillo, a bookseller. ``If it's one game, anybody 
could win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia noted that Cuba's team would be in peak form for the  
proposed March or April meeting because its baseball season ends in 
late March, while the U.S. team would be in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said technical issues would have to be settled: Cuba,  
for example, uses metal bats; the U.S. players use wood. 
</P>
<P>
	Portillo, wearing a worn windbreaker against an unusual chill,  
said allowing nonrelatives to send money to Cubans is ``going to 
benefit life here a lot'' because dollars sent to the island 
circulate through the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, which courted Cuban-American  
strongholds in Florida, has refused to lift the economic embargo 
imposed by the United States after Castro took power in 1959. But 
the administration has explored ways to boost contacts with Cubans 
that don't benefit the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles have tried to play exhibition games in Cuba since at  
least 1996, but the Treasury Department has rejected the requests 
as out of line with trade policy.

<HEADLINE> Lucas: Six 'Star War' Films Enough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- George Lucas says six ``Star Wars'' movies are  
enough. 
</P>
<P>
	The 55-year-old creator of the series says after the three-part  
prequel is released, he does not plan on making any more films 
based on the original movie. The perception has been that the 
complete Star Wars saga would be nine parts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never had a story for the sequels, for the later ones,''  
Lucas says in the Jan. 4 edition of Vanity Fair. ``And also, I'll 
be to a point in my age where to do another trilogy would take 10 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first movie in the new series, ``Star Wars: Episode I The  
Phantom Menace,'' is scheduled to be released May 21. The film 
stars Liam Neeson as a Jedi master and Ewan McGregor as a young Ben 
Kenobi. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas said the new films will include the tale of how Anakin  
Skywalker, father of Luke and Princess Leia, became Darth Vader. 
</P>
<P>
	Episodes II and III are promised for the years 2002 and 2005,  
Lucas said.

<HEADLINE> China Police Probe Labor Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese police today began investigating a  
protest by retired workers angry over unpaid pensions to see if 
their demonstration had a more suspicious political motive. 
</P>
<P>
	Police released three people taken away for questioning during  
Monday's protest by about 100 retired workers from a furniture 
factory in the central industrial city of Wuhan, an official at the 
factory said. 
</P>
<P>
	The official, who gave his surname, Xue, said the protest was  
resolved peacefully and that no one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	The police dispatched an investigative team to the Qintai  
furniture factory and the team is expected to remain for a few 
days, said another official surnamed Li. The police were looking to 
see if there was any political motivation behind the demonstration, 
the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese authorities are worried about possible widespread,  
organized labor unrest as unemployment soars and struggling state 
companies have trouble paying wages and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 27, a Chinese court handed a 10-year jail term to a  
labor activist who tried setting up an independent association to 
protect laid-off workers' rights. The harsh punishment underscored 
the government's determination to quash any attempts to organize 
discontented workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The retirees in Wuhan had not received their $18 monthly pension  
for three months, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human 
Rights and Democratic Movement in China said. It added that pension 
payment troubles started after another company took over the 
factory last year. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for police in Wuhan, who have his surname, Lu,  
denied that a demonstration or any arrests took place.

<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Tennessee was a perfect No. 1 in the final  
Associated Press Top 25 college football poll. 
</P>
<P>
	The Volunteers (13-0) completed an undefeated season Monday

<HEADLINE> 4 Israeli Athletes Turn In Medals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Four Israeli Maccabi champions turned in their  
medals Tuesday, demanding that the president of the sports 
organization step down during an inquiry into a fatal bridge 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	World Maccabi Union President Ronald Bakalarz, about to testify  
before a special Israeli parliamentary inquiry, appeared angry and 
frustrated as the athletes put their medals on the table in front 
of him. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 14, 1997, athletes were marching across a specially  
built footbridge into the Tel Aviv stadium during the opening 
ceremony of the Maccabiah, also known as the Jewish Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The bridge collapsed under the Australian and Austrian teams,  
dumping them into the Yarkon River. Four Australian athletes died, 
and 64 people were injured from the fall or made ill from the 
polluted waters. 
</P>
<P>
	Debby Marcus, 57, returned a trophy she received as one of  
Israel's top athletes during the nation's first 50 years. Her son 
Boaz, 21, handed over two bronze medals he won for lawn bowling in 
the 1997 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcus, who won track medals in the 1961 and 1965 games, gripped  
her small statue by the Maccabi emblem, turned it upside down, and 
told The Associated Press, ``If my son had been on that bridge, I 
would have used this to kill the person responsible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman Micha Goldman, the only committee member present when  
the one-hour session began, declared that Maccabi Union leaders, 
including Bakalarz, must assume responsibility for the bridge 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	Bakalarz said Goldman had already prejudged the case. He  
complained that by allowing the athletes to return their medals, 
Goldman had ``allowed a display of showmanship for the media,'' and 
called the committee proceedings a ``kangaroo court.''

<HEADLINE> Starr's Secrecy Request Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge has rejected Independent Counsel  
Kenneth Starr's request to maintain the secrecy of court documents 
showing that two of President Clinton's top aides were not in 
jeopardy of being prosecuted in the Monica Lewinsky case. 
</P>
<P>
	In a ruling made public Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Norma  
Holloway Johnson said there was no need to keep confidential the 
documents showing White House aides Bruce Lindsey and Sidney 
Blumenthal were only fact witnesses and never targets for 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	Documents Starr had made public to Congress already had divulged  
that fact, the judge said. The ruling does not state why Starr 
wanted to keep the information secret. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson also ordered the release later this week of additional  
documents from the investigation into whether Starr's office 
illegally leaked grand jury evidence from the Lewinsky probe to the 
news media. 
</P>
<P>
	Those documents show among other things that on Oct. 30 the  
judge rejected an appeal from Starr to reconsider her earlier 
ruling ordering his prosecutors to attend a hearing and prove they 
weren't the source of news media leaks about the Lewinsky case. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr denied such leaks, but Johnson had concluded there was  
circumstantial evidence that at least two dozens such leaks could 
have come from Starr's office and that further investigation was 
warranted. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaks probe continues even though the Lewinsky grand jury  
investigation has ended and the evidence has now been made public 
as part of the impeachment proceedings against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court will unseal these papers because continued secrecy  
is not necessary to prevent disclosure of matters occurring before 
the grand jury,'' the judge said in the ruling made public Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a lengthy footnote in the ruling, she rejected the request  
from Starr's office that ``all references to the target/nontarget 
status'' of Blumenthal and Lindsey be kept secret when the new 
court documents are released. 
</P>
<P>
	A target is someone who has been informed by prosecutors that  
they are likely to be indicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson noted, however, that in grand jury transcripts turned  
over to Congress during the impeachment debate last fall, 
prosecutors were quoted as telling Lindsey and Blumenthal they were 
not targets, just witnesses, called before the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Because those transcripts are already public, ``the court finds  
that such redaction is unnecessary in this case,'' Johnson wrote.

<HEADLINE> 12-Year-Old Testifies in Rape Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- A 12-year-old girl testified today that  
former NCAA track champion Chris Nelloms, who ran for Ohio State, 
raped her numerous times. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl told a Montgomery County Common Pleas Court jury that  
the first assault happened in 1996 when she was 9. 
</P>
<P>
	``He started pulling my pants down,'' the girl said. ``I didn't  
know what he was doing.'' She said it hurt her, and she didn't tell 
anyone because she was scared. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelloms showed no visible emotion during the testimony. His  
attorney contended in the trial's opening statements Monday that 
there is no evidence to support the child's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelloms, now 26, was indicted in June and charged with eight  
counts of rape of a child under 13 and one count each of attempt to 
commit rape of a child under 13 and felonious sexual penetration of 
a child under 13. Nelloms faces a life sentence if convicted of 
rape of a child under 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Montgomery County prosecutor Angela Frydman said the  
evidence would show that Nelloms raped the girl on several 
occasions in Dayton and Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	Frydman said the girl was 9 when Nelloms first assaulted her,  
but didn't tell anyone until divulging it to a friend last April 
after watching a television show on child sexual abuse. She said 
Nelloms later told the girl not to tell anyone or he would go to 
the electric chair. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the surface she appears to be a typical 12-year-old girl,''  
Frydman said. ``But she harbors the scars of a child who has been 
the victim of sexual abuse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, defense attorney Kevin Lennen said the girl has changed  
her story and that the evidence won't support her allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The child lies about everything. The child is a pathological  
liar,'' Lennen said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, Nelloms was shot during a late-night jog in Trotwood.  
He was wounded just above the heart and remained in critical 
condition for two days. However, he made a swift recovery and came 
back in March 1993 to win the NCAA indoor 200-meter championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The following May, Nelloms collapsed during practice two days  
before a Big Ten meet after being stricken with a muscle spasm 
around his heart. There was some doubt he would be able to run, but 
he won the 100- and 200-meter dashes at the meet and went on to win 
the NCAA championship in the 200. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, Nelloms placed sixth in the U.S. national championships  
and second in the World University Games and finished in the top 
five in six major European meets.

<HEADLINE> Dunkin' Donuts Tries To Shed Store </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dunkin' Donuts is suing to cancel its franchise  
agreement with the owner of a shop where rodents were photographed 
nibbling on doughnuts. 
</P>
<P>
	A photo of a mouse resting on a glazed doughnut while munching a  
coconut-covered one was published by the New York Post last week 
with the caption: ``EEEEEEK! Guess who's eating the donuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper followed up the story for two days with stories  
headlined ``Mouse Trap'' and ``Under Mouse Arrest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the federal lawsuit, Dunkin' Donuts said it sent the  
franchise operator, National Donut Restaurants of New York Inc., a 
termination notice Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was determined that there had been gross negligence of our  
Dunkin' Donuts standards at this one location,'' said company 
spokeswoman Jen Rosenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	The Randolph, Mass.-based company, with more than 3,400 shops in  
the United States and more than 1,000 overseas, said the store on 
trendy Fifth Avenue in midtown Manhattan breached its contract by 
permitting a mice infestation. 
</P>
<P>
	A store inspection last week found fresh mouse droppings in the  
basement and storage areas, said Sandra Mullin, a spokeswoman for 
the city's health department. The inspection also noted missing 
ceiling tiles, structural holes and spilled syrup and grease on the 
floor, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The city, however, did not find violations sufficient to close  
the store, Mullin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunkin' Donuts was still inspecting all 30 of its New York City  
franchises operated by Riese Restaurants, the parent company of the 
store. Riese operates other fast-food restaurant chains in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	Dawn Rowan, a spokeswoman for Riese and the Fifth Avenue store,  
said company lawyers had not reviewed the court papers and could 
not comment. She said the shop remained open for business.

<HEADLINE> $215M Eyed for Jail Drug Treatments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Tuesday he will propose  
$215 million in his next budget to test and treat inmates for drug 
use, to help them avoid returning to crime once they are freed. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton cited a Justice Department report that seven of every 10  
federal prisoners had used drugs prior to their arrests, and 
one-fifth were on drugs when they committed the crimes that sent 
them to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposal sets aside $100 million in the fiscal 2000  
budget for treatment and testing of offenders in prison as well as 
those on probation or parole. It also includes $50 million for 
creating more local drug courts and $65 million for residential 
drug treatment in state prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we are going to continue to reduce the rate of crime, we  
have to do something to avoid releasing criminals with their 
dangerous drug habits intact,'' Clinton said. ``To inmates in every 
state, we want to send a message: If you stay on drugs, you must 
stay behind bars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also announced the release of $120 million under the  
fiscal 1999 budget for drug-free prison initiatives -- $63 million 
earmarked for state prisons to provide long-term treatment and 
intensive supervision for prisoners with the most serious drug 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	During a White House ceremony with his drug policy adviser and  
Attorney General Janet Reno, Clinton said drug use is a persistent 
problem in prisons. He noted Chicago Mayor Richard Daley once said 
it is easier to get drugs in the Illinois penitientiary than on his 
city's streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a statement that could be made in more than half the  
states in this country,'' Clinton said. ``So we still have a lot to 
do. There is no better way to start than to help our prisoners 
break clean from drugs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president also cited Bureau of Justice Statistics data that  
connected drug use to other crimes, from burglary and auto theft to 
assault and murder. He said 83 percent of state prisoners and 73 
percent of federal prisoners had used drugs in 1997. Fifty-seven 
percent of state prisoners and 45 percent of federal prisoners had 
used drugs in the month before they were arrested, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to break this cycle,'' Clinton said. ``We have to give  
these people a chance to be drug-free and to be productive citizens 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If approved by Congress, the money would represent an increase  
of about $100 million over funds currently available to enforce 
``zero tolerance'' of drug use by prisoners, parolees and 
probationers. 
</P>
<P>
	White House drug policy director Barry McCaffrey said it costs  
taxpayers about $43,000 a year to incarcerate an untreated addict, 
while providing prison-based treatment for that addict costs about 
$2,700 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a no-brainer for smart drug policy, for smart  
incarceration policy,'' McCaffrey said.

<HEADLINE> Prosecution Rests in Anwar Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- The prosecution in the sex and  
corruption trial of former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim 
rested its case today, paving the way for defense lawyers to call 
their own witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related development, the country's top legal officer  
confirmed what people already knew: that police beat Anwar on the 
night of his dramatic arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am also of the opinion that the Royal Malaysia Police is  
fully responsible for the injuries to (Anwar) whilst in the legal 
custody of the police,'' Attorney-General Mohtar Abdullah said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time that the government has admitted that  
Anwar's bruises and a severe black eye was caused by a police 
beating on Sept. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Anwar faces a total 10 counts of illegal sex and corruption  
charges. The current trial is for four corruption charges relating 
to allegations that he misused his office to cover up extramarital 
liaisons. 
</P>
<P>
	Anwar was fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Sept. 2  
and arrested soon afterward for organizing public protests 
demanding an end to Mahathir's 17-year-rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Anwar, 51, has denied the allegations against him, saying they  
are politically motivated and aimed at destroying his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Before chief prosecutor Abdul Gani Patail wound up testimony  
today, lawyers defending Anwar accused police of planting semen 
stains on a mattress that had been presented as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Police seized the mattress from an apartment they say Anwar used  
for secret trysts to commit adultery and sodomy -- both crimes in 
this predominantly Muslim country. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have implied that the stains on the mattress prove  
that Anwar had an affair with his secretary's wife and repeatedly 
sodomized his former driver. Prosecutors say the stains contained 
DNA matching Anwar's. 
</P>
<P>
	But defense attorney Christopher Fernando noted that police  
could have extracted semen from Anwar after beating him unconscious 
on the night of his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our allegation was that these seminal stains were planted on  
the mattress,'' Fernando told the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Superintendent of Police Mohamad Rodwan Mohamad Yusof  
said he did not know if semen had been extracted from Anwar while 
he was unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the prosecution's ample use of scientific evidence from  
DNA tests, Judge Augustine Paul rejected a request by the defense 
to bring its own DNA analyst to court. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense argued today that even if the stains on the mattress  
matched Anwar's DNA, they did not prove the charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a Malaysian businessman has called today on the  
nation's Islamic court to punish Anwar for allegedly committing 
adultery. 
</P>
<P>
	Khairuddin Abu Hassan filed a complaint with the Federal Shariah  
Court, saying Anwar ``made use of religion to cover up his 
wrongdoings'' and desecrated Islam. 
</P>
<P>
	The Islamic court, if it finds the ousted deputy prime minister  
guilty, could whip Anwar with a rattan cane and demand that he pay 
a fine for his offenses.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins' McDuffie May Miss Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Injuries have hobbled the Miami Dolphins'  
offensive and defensive lines this season, and now their top 
receiver may miss Saturday's playoff game at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	O.J. McDuffie, who led the NFL in catches, was one of three  
starters to miss practice Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	McDuffie sprained his right foot in Saturday's victory over the  
Buffalo Bills. Tight end Troy Drayton (sprained ankle) and tackle 
Richmond Webb (arm) also missed practice. The Dolphins also lost 
defensive tackle Tim Bowens on Saturday to a season-ending arm 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	McDuffie had 90 receptions this season for 1,050 yards and seven  
touchdowns. He hasn't missed a game since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been as fine a clutch receiver as I've been around,''  
Johnson said. ``It would be significant if he's not able to go, and 
it will affect us if he's not able to go full speed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the injuries, Johnson was in a jovial mood following the  
Dolphins' practice in 55-degree weather. 
</P>
<P>
	``The positive thing is we've got this cold weather, so it's  
preparing us a little more for Denver,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After Miami beat the Broncos 31-21 last month, Denver tight end  
Shannon Sharpe said his team was 10 to 14 points better than the 
Dolphins. Oddsmakers agree, listing the Broncos as 13-point 
favorites. 
</P>
<P>
	``A couple of touchdowns and building,'' Johnson said.  
``Evidently the oddsmakers are listening to Shannon Sharpe.''

<HEADLINE> Report Cites Harassment of Homeless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's homeless people are increasingly  
being harassed by police, driven from the streets in which they beg 
and sleep by cities putting ``meanness'' ahead of compassion, an 
advocacy group's report contends. 
</P>
<P>
	Many cities are bent on ``criminalizing homelessness'' and are  
failing to take advantage of existing constructive methods to treat 
homeless people for physical and mental problems and get them into 
housing and jobs, says the report by the National Law Center on 
Homelessness and Poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	But affordable housing remains a principal barrier, according to  
the report released Monday. It is the fifth such report issued 
since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``While cities continue to crack down on homeless people,  
resources to shelter homeless people or to help them to become 
self-sufficient are sorely lacking,'' the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of sending in the police to move and arrest these  
people, you can provide resources,'' said Maria Foscarinis, the 
center's executive director. ``Criminalizing is a quick fix, but 
it's not a solution. People have to go somewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report says many cities are turning to their police forces  
to enforce new or old laws that limit the use of public space and 
restrict begging. They are targeting the homeless for selective 
enforcement of the law and conducting sweeps to physically remove 
them, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	It cited five cities -- Atlanta, Chicago, New York, San Francisco  
and Tucson, Ariz. -- as being especially tough on the homeless and 
``promoting the `meanest' streets.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The report makes these assertions:  
</P>
<P>
	--Atlanta: ``Sweeps and crackdowns continue to occur with  
homeless people being removed from under bridges and moved along in 
the downtown area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Chicago: The city ``has made a concerted effort to arrest and  
prosecute homeless people for panhandling'' and is trying to remove 
them altogether from certain areas. 
</P>
<P>
	--New York City: ``There continues to be a crackdown on homeless  
people as the mayor focuses on `quality of life' violations; sweeps 
continue on an almost nightly basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--San Francisco: ``From January to November 1998 the police  
issued over 16,000 `quality of life' violation tickets, the 
majority of which were issued to homeless people. Police are taking 
pictures of people they claim are `habitual drinkers' ... and 
distributing them to liquor stores.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Tucson: ``City officials fully accept the criminalization  
policy; council members proposed looking into a plan to privatize 
the sidewalks which would allow business owners to keep homeless 
people off the sidewalks. Some homeless people were released from 
jail with travel restrictions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Some concerns about public space are legitimate,'' the report  
says. ``Ultimately, no city resident -- homeless or housed -- wants 
people living and begging in the streets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it contends that rather than turning to the police, ``cities  
must concentrate on efforts to alleviate the problem of 
homelessness rather than concentrating on the symptoms of the 
problem.''

</P>
<P>
	The company expects to report fourth-quarter earnings of 50  
cents to 55 cents a share, below analysts' estimates of 73 cents. 
For the fourth quarter of 1997, Storage Technology earned $83.7 
million or $1.46 a diluted share, before a 2-for-1 stock split 
effective June 26, 1998. In a press release, Storage Technology 
said revenues will be below the $663.9 million reported a year ago 
but higher than third-quarter revenues of $571.1 million. It said 
revenue from the new products was insufficient to offset an

</P>
<P>
	The German software maker had a 15 percent pretax profit gain in  
1998, far below the 30 percent-to-35 percent increase it originally 
forecast. A dramatic slowdown in Japanese and Russian sales reduced 
expected fourth-quarter revenue by 240 million Deutsche marks, the

	Clinton Faces Historic Trial  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the first time in 130 years and only the  
second time in history, a president will be tried in the Senate for 
impeachment. Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said the trial 
against President Clinton will begin Thursday. ``It has to be done 
not only expeditiously, but fairly,'' Lott said. It was left 
unclear how long the trial would last or whether any witnesses will 
be called to testify in the case.

	GOP's Hastert Extends Olive Branch  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican lawmakers nominated Rep. Dennis  
Hastert today to be the next House speaker, and he immediately 
extended an olive branch to Democrats in a capital riven by 
partisan bitterness. ``I'm going to meet the Democratic leadership 
and Democratic caucus halfway, and I expect them to come halfway 
and meet me,'' he said. In comments before most of the 222 
Republicans who will serve in the next House, Hastert offered no 
specifics about where he would seek cooperation with Democrats. 
But, acknowledging the thin majority his party will have, he said, 
``We need to make the effort.''

	U.S. Fires on Iraqi Planes  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Four U.S. jets fired on -- but missed -- four  
Iraqi MiGs testing the ``no-fly'' zone today over southern Iraq. It 
was the first such showdown in more than six years. The Iraqis 
``beat a hasty retreat'' following the early morning clashes, which 
occurred in two separate incidents just 15 minutes and 62 miles 
apart, said the Pentagon. Also, Saddam Hussein urged Arabs to stand 
behind Iraq in its dispute.

	U.S. Base Closings Are Sought

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton intends to ask Congress for  
authority to close more U.S. military bases starting in 2001 to 
help offset the cost of armed forces improvements, officials said. 
Congress approved several rounds of base closings earlier this 
decade. But since the last round in 1995, it has rejected attempts 
by the Clinton administration to further shrink the network of 
bases.

John Ashcroft, R-Mo., took himself out of the running today. The 
56-year-old former governor said he will instead concentrate on 
winning a second Senate term. ``Leadership is about making

``The steps are designed to help the Cuban people without 
strengthening the Cuban government,'' Clinton said. His program 
calls for an expansion of cash transfers from private Americans to 
needy Cubans and opens the way for increased people-to-people 
exchanges, direct mail service and the non-governmental sale of 
food.

<HEADLINE> US: Saddam's Son Directed Murders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department says one of Iraqi  
president Saddam Hussein's sons directed the murder of hundreds of 
Iraqi dissidents last November in the Shiite region of southern 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman James P. Rubin said Monday tensions in the south, a  
stronghold of anti-Saddam sentiment, rose after the assassinations 
of two senior Islamic clerics this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	He said there have been reports of mass arrests throughout the  
southern region and in the Shiite areas outside Baghdad over the 
past six weeks -- in addition to hundreds of summary executions of 
dissidents at two prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	``The repression reportedly reached a peak in November, with  
hundreds killed in actions directed personally by Qusai Hussein,'' 
Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regime military action against the Shiites is an intrinsic and  
continuing part of this campaign of repression. Since 1991 the 
regime has been carrying out the widespread and brutal repression 
of the Shiite population of southern Iraq.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said opposition sources from the Shiite areas reported  
that seven villages were recently destroyed or turned into military 
outposts. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that more than 2,000 civilians who were unable to flee  
were reportedly taken hostage by regime forces and possibly sent to 
Baghdad. They were made up largely of the old, the infirm, women 
and children, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As a means of protecting Iraqi Kurds in the northern part of the  
country and the Shiites in the south, the United States, Britain 
and France have forbidden Iraq to send military flights over these 
areas through the establishment of ``no-fly zones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saddam calls the zones illegal and vows to fight what he sees as  
violations of Iraqi airspace. In two recent clashes, U.S. jet 
fighters fired on Iraqi anti-aircraft batteries after allegedly 
being fired on by Iraqi missiles.

<HEADLINE> FAA Delays Air Navigation System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government decided Tuesday to delay the  
start of a $1 billion satellite navigation system for airplanes 
because of difficulties in designing its final piece of computer 
software. 
</P>
<P>
	The first phase of the Wide Area Augmentation System was to have  
entered service in July. Instead, the Federal Aviation 
Administration said the date has been pushed back 14 months to 
September 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The system will allow civil aircraft to navigate off of the  
Global Position System satellite network instead of ground-based 
radio signals. It will correct the standard GPS signals, which are 
purposely degraded by the military, to provide the pinpoint 
accuracy, integrity and reliability needed for airplane navigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Establishment of a satellite-based system will also let the FAA  
phase out its costly network of ground-based navigational aids. In 
addition, it will provide airliners with their precise position at 
all times and eventually allow them to fly direct routes from 
departure to arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently they are confined to a system of aerial highways,  
which can lead them into bad weather and also lengthen flight 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA has completed work on all the required hardware for the  
first phase of the system, including 25 ground reference stations. 
It also has completed work on all of the software except for the 
final element, known as the Correction and Verification system. 
</P>
<P>
	It must perform more than 20 functions, including determining  
the precise positions of satellites and the atmospheric effects on 
the navigation signals. 
</P>
<P>
	The schedule change comes after the system's contractor, the  
Raytheon Co. of Lexington, Mass., found that designing the system 
was ``a much greater challenge than originally anticipated,'' said 
Steven Zaidman, the FAA's associate administrator for research and 
acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	Agency Administrator Jane Garvey said that despite the delay:  
``The FAA remains committed to the implementation of WAAS because 
of its safety benefits.'' The full system is supposed to consist of 
54 ground reference stations, eight master stations and 14 ground 
earth stations. 
</P>
<P>
	An agency spokesman said the FAA and Raytheon are revising their  
contract to account for the delay. Referring to the added cost, FAA 
spokesman Paul Takemoto said: ``We are working that out with 
Raytheon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, the project had an estimated cost of $509 million. The  
most recent FAA estimate is just over $1 billion.

<HEADLINE> Devils' Andreychuk Breaks Ankle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Dave Andreychuk, whose 528 goals is  
tops among active left wings, broke his right ankle in the first 
period of the New Jersey Devils' 3-3 tie against the San Jose 
Sharks on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately known how long the injury will sideline  
Andreychuk, but he will not undergo surgery, as he did two years 
ago when he broke his left ankle. That break was displaced. This 
one is not. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to be careful the next few days,'' said  
Andreychuk, leaning on crutches after the game. ``We have to go 
back and re-evaluate it and see how it is. I don't know if a 
fractured ankle is good at any point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andreychuk was on his knees in front of Sharks goaltender Mike  
Vernon when San Jose defenseman Marcus Ragnarsson fell over him 
during a scramble in front of the net. The 17-year veteran had to 
be helped off the ice, but said he knew right away the ankle was 
broken. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still kind of foggy about what happened,'' Andreychuk  
said. ``I know the puck came in front and I was on my knees and I 
was trying to get it and put it in the net and somebody fell over 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andreychuk was taken to the Meadowlands Hospital in Secaucus,  
where X-rays disclosed a fracture. The team said he would be 
evaluated again in a few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreychuk missed most of the playoffs in 1997 after breaking  
his left ankle in the final game of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreychuk had 11 goals and 11 assists in 29 games this season.

<HEADLINE> Canucks' Zezel Out Four Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Vancouver Canucks center  
Peter Zezel will miss at least four weeks after being diagnosed 
with a small fracture in his left tibia, the NHL club announced 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Zezel suffered the injury following a clean body check from  
Montreal's Trent McCleary eight minutes into the second period of 
Saturday's 2-1 loss to the Canadiens. The Canucks, who complete a 
two-game road trip in Dallas on Wednesday, won't make a roster move 
until they return home and after more tests are conducted on Zezel 
on Wednesday, a club spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zezel, who's been shifted between the Canucks' second, third and  
fourth lines, has one goal in his last 19 games. In 35 games this 
season, he has six goals and 13 points.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Up at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar gained against the yen Wednesday  
when investors bought greenbacks after recent sharp declines. 
Japanese stock prices edged higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 112.09 yen in midday trading, up 0.57 yen from  
late Tuesday in Tokyo and also higher than its late New York level 
of 111.21 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 100.68  
points, or 0.76 percent, to 13,333.42 points to close the morning 
session. On Tuesday, the average finished down 183.15 points, or 
1.37 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar's slight rebound came after  
Japanese interbank players purchased dollars to cover short, or 
oversold positions. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar plunged to 110.40 yen at one point in New York  
trading Tuesday -- its lowest level in 27 months. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market was short on dollars, so people are buying to cover  
those positions,'' said Shuji Takano of ABN AMRO Bank in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the other hand, there is selling by U.S. players which  
capped the upward movement,'' Takano added. 
</P>
<P>
	In the third official day of euro trading, dealing in the new  
currency was thin, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at dlrs 1.1728 at midday, below dlrs 1.1777  
late Tuesday in New York. The euro was at dlrs 1.1810 in Tokyo late 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The new currency is trading at 131.60 yen, down from 131.65 yen  
earlier but above 131.10 yen in New York late Tuesday. The euro was 
quoted late Tuesday in Tokyo at 131.92 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices moved into positive territory  
as investors bought selected issues following heavy losses Monday 
and Tuesday. The Nikkei average had shed about 600 points in the 
past two sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Also supporting the Tokyo market was an overnight rally on Wall  
Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average finished at 9,311.19 
points Tuesday, up 126.92. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, trading in Tokyo remained slow as investors held back to  
watch the dollar's movement against the yen, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shares in exporters aren't that strong despite the rise on  
Wall Street because the dollar remains weak,'' said Masatoshi Sato 
of Kankaku Securities. A strong yen tends to make Japanese exports 
more expensive overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts also said overseas investment in Japanese stocks at the  
start of the new year has been lower than expected, dampening 
market sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section gained 2.30 points, or 0.22 percent, to 1050.63 
points. The TOPIX closed down 16.59 points, or 1.56 percent, on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese  
government bond fell to 1.880 percent from Tuesday's finish of 
1.910 percent, pushing its price up to 99.35 yen from 99.11 yen.

<TEXT>
<P>
	When Arnold Palmer joined the PGA Tour in 1955, prize money for  
the entire season was $782,010, which wouldn't have even been 
enough to finish in the top 30 on the money list last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I started, the total purse was $10,000 at tournaments,  
and now we're looking at $5 million in one tournament,'' Palmer 
said in a conference call Tuesday, alluding to the new World Golf 
Championship events. ``That's a pretty rapid progression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All in all, he considers the explosive growth in golf to be  
``pretty fantastic.'' But he is not without some trepidation, 
mainly that golf becomes so money-oriented that it loses sight of 
how it got there. 
</P>
<P>
	``My concerns are protecting the game and keeping the game and  
its integrity that has been so great for so long,'' Palmer said. 
``We should not be getting into squabbles about how we distribute 
money and how we make eligibility rules. All those things should be 
worked out with the PGA Tour, and that door is open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer is coming off what he recently called a ``horrible  
year.'' On the same day he finished the last of his precautionary 
radiation treatments for prostate cancer, he learned that his wife, 
Winnie, has been diagnosed with ovarian cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	She has had chemotherapy the past six months and Palmer said she  
is doing well. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I just had my checkup after radiation and got a good  
report back,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer returns to golf in Hawaii at the end of the month for the  
Senior Skins Game, where Ray Floyd will try to win for the sixth 
straight year. Hale Irwin and Jack Nicklaus are also playing. 
Palmer has played in every Senior Skins except 1997, when he missed 
because of his cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, I can do a little better than I've been doing  
recently,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GOLF WRITERS AWARDS:* Casey Martin has won the Ben Hogan Award,  
given annually by the Golf Writers Association of America to a 
player who continue to be active despite a physical handicap or 
serious illness. 
</P>
<P>
	The GWAA also honored Judy Rankin with the William D. Richardson  
Award for outstanding contributions to golf. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, 26, was born with a circulatory disease in his right  
leg, making it difficult for him to walk and play. Martin 
successfully sued the PGA Tour for the right to use a cart in 
competition, which drew attention to barriers for the disabled and 
sparked a debate whether walking is an integral part of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	He won a Nike Tour event before winning in federal court, then  
qualified for the U.S. Open, where he tied for 23rd at The Olympic 
Club. Martin won the award over Jim Colbert, who returned from 
cancer to win on the Senior Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Rankin, 53, has worked for ABC Sports as a commentator, was  
captain of the winning U.S. teams in the 1996 and 1998 Solheim Cup 
and has been an outspoken advocate of women's health issues. 
</P>
<P>
	During her career on the LPGA Tour, she won 26 times and became  
the first woman to surpass $100,000 in earnings in 1976. She won 
the Richardson Award over Tom Cousins, the Atlanta developer who 
rejuvenated the East Lake Golf Club and neighborhood, and Charles 
Yates, longtime secretary of Augusta National. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin and Rankin will be honored April 7 in Augusta along with  
the other GWAA's players of the year -- Mark O'Meara, Se Ri Pak and 
Hale Irwin. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PAR-3 PREVIEW:* If Hank Kuehne's first trip to Augusta National  
is any indication, he probably won't win the Masters in April -- if 
only because he'll run away with the Par-3 contest. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuehne, who got an invitation by winning the U.S. Amateur, went  
to Augusta National last month with U.S. Mid-Amateur champion 
Spider Miller and U.S. Amateur runner-up Tom McKnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuehne played the par-3 course in 7-under 20, tying the record  
previously set by Gay Brewer and Art Wall. Kuehne made all but one 
of his seven birdie putts from inside 8 feet, but was kicking 
himself over his two missed birdie putts from 15 and 18 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both putts were uphill, right on line and dead center,'' he  
told The Dallas Morning News. ``If I just hit them, it's an 18 
instead of a 20. But the one thing you don't think about at Augusta 
National is needing to hit a putt harder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one has ever won the Par-3 Contest and the Masters in the  
same year. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MIA AT MERCEDES:* The Mercedes Championships may be the  
toughest field to make since it gets only champions from the 
previous year, but that doesn't mean everyone will show -- such as 
Greg Norman, who skipped last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those MIA this week are Lee Westwood of England and Nick  
Price, who has played this event only three times in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Olin Brownie, who qualified for the first time by winning in  
Hartford, is still recovering from arm surgery, and the other two 
absentees have family matters -- Ernie Els got married in South 
Africa on New Year's Eve and Hal Sutton is home in Louisiana 
because his wife is expecting twins. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DIVOTS:* Fred Couples has his old set of Lynx irons in the bag  
this week for the Mercedes Championships because he plays them 
better in windy conditions. While he still has the Maxfli 
Revolution irons, his long-term plan is to return to the Armour 
845s. ... Shigeki Maruyama, who won all five of his matches for the 
International team in the Presidents Cup, was voted the Asian 
Golfer of the Month. ... Mary Capouch, a former editor of 
Mademoiselle magazine, has been elected to a one-year term as 
chairman of the USGA's Women's Committee. The committee conducts 
the U.S. Women's Open and U.S. Women's Amateur, and selects the 
players for the Curtis Cup and Women's World Amateur teams. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STAT OF THE WEEK:* Phil Mickelson is playing the winners-only  
Mercedes Championship for the sixth straight year. The record 
belongs to Billy Casper, who played 14 in a row starting in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FINAL WORD:* ``I don't see pitchers out there trying to win the  
World Series smiling.'' -- David Duval, on why he looks so serious 
on the golf course.

<HEADLINE> IRS Offers New Tax Filing Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tax time will tell whether the IRS is really  
more helpful and responsive to taxpayers this year. But as tax 
filing season begins, officials say at least it will be easier to 
get through on the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Internal Revenue Service opened its taxpayer help  
lines (1-800-829-1040) 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In the 
past, those lines were staffed 16 hours a day, six days a week 
leading up to the April 15 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``During this year's filing season, we'll never close,'' IRS  
Commissioner Charles Rossotti told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossotti and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said the longer  
help line hours, along with other improvements, will mean fewer 
busy signals and less time spent on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, IRS offices in 250 locations will be open on 13  
Saturdays between Jan. 16 and April 10. Last year, such ``help 
sessions'' were held only on the last few Saturdays at a few 
locations before the tax filing deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxpayers should call IRS to find the office nearest them that  
will be open on Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
	These changes are part of the 1998 reform law intended to  
transform the much-maligned IRS into a friendlier, more 
service-oriented agency. This law gets its first test in this tax 
filing season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that by doing our job better, people will understand  
that the IRS ... is not an enemy of the taxpayers at all,'' 
Rossotti said. ``Our job is to be an agent to help the taxpayer 
meet the obligations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For people with computer access to the Internet, the IRS site on  
the World Wide Web (http://www.irs.ustreas.gov) features tax forms, 
changes in tax law, publications, tax tables, answers to frequently 
asked questions and links to other tax-related sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossotti also said IRS has finished testing some 70,000 computer  
programs to ensure they are ready for 2000, when computer systems 
may be disrupted by a date-related glitch. 
</P>
<P>
	This tax filing season, he said, ``is a test run'' for those  
repairs -- and taxpayers should be on the lookout for errors such as 
wrong tax notices or failure to promptly receive a due refund. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be prepared, if there are problems, to respond to them  
very quickly,'' Rossotti said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Higher; Dow Up 37 Points / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened higher this morning, with  
blue-chips lifted by IBM and AT&AMP;T and technology stocks stronger 
despite fears that they would retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 37.07 at 9,221.34. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were higher.  
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 3.14 at 1,231.24 , and  
the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 3.42 at 
2,211.47. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 1.54 at 595.66, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 1.60 at 685.21. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 76.59 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM was up 5/8 at 183 5/8, and AT&AMP;T was up 1 7/16 at 79 5/16.  
</P>
<P>
	America Online, which was added to the S&AMP;P 500 composite last  
week, was down 1 7/16 at 147 3/8 in leading volume on the New York 
Stock Exchange after losing ground Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday the Dow finished up 2.84 at 9,184.27 after swinging  
widely throughout the first trading session of the year. Traders 
poured money into the market all morning on the assumption that 
institutional and retail investors would be buying aggressively to 
put yearend cash bonuses to work. But the rally faded by late 
morning, and the Dow dipped more than 50 points into negative 
territory before a late rally pushed it marginally higher into the 
close. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders embarked on this morning's session fearing that the  
choppiness would continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.4 percent to its  
lowest close since last Oct. 15. In afternoon trading, Germany's 
Xetra DAX electronic trading index was down 1.6 percent, Britain's 
FT-SE 100 was up 0.02 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 1 
percent.
