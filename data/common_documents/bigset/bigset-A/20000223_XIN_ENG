<HEADLINE> HK Plans to Integrate Vietnamese Refugees, Migrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government has decided to widen a
local resettlement scheme for Vietnamese refugees, Regina Ip,
secretary for security of the Hong Kong SAR, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Ip announced details of a
plan endorsed by the Chief Executive-in-Council Tuesday morning to
integrate the Vietnamese into the local community.
</P>
<P>
In order to tackle the residual problems of Vietnamese refugees
(VRs) and Vietnamese migrants (VMs), the Hong Kong government has
settled to allow 1,400 Vietnamese to apply for settlement in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Local Resettlement Scheme was introduced in 1986 to provide
an opportunity for a limited number of VRs to settle in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Under the widened scheme, all 973 VRs stranded in Hong Kong,
327 "non-national" VMs and their 108 family members will be
eligible to apply for settlement here. Successful applicants will
be allowed to stay and be issued with a Hong Kong Identity Card.
</P>
<P>
Ip stressed that the widened scheme would not apply to
Vietnamese illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
She noted that strenuous efforts had been made by the
administration to look for resettlement opportunities for the VRs
and repatriate the non-national VMs, but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
At present, about 580 VRs and 430 VMs are living in the Pillar
Point Vietnamese Refugees Center, Tuen Mun of Hong Kong, together
with some 60 Ex-Chinese Vietnamese. The upkeep of the refugee
center costs 20 million Hong Kong dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
As an integral part of the residence offer, the camp will be
closed by the end of May this year. All residents of the camp will
have to move out.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi FM Stresses Cooperation in D-8 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Foreign Minister
Abdus Samad Azad Tuesday said cooperation among the Developing-8 (
D-8) would be beneficial to the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
"Greater cooperation among D-8 countries would be beneficial to
the Islamic world in general and member countries in particular,"
Azad said while inaugurating the seventh meeting of the D-8
Commission here.
</P>
<P>
The D-8 group, comprising Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran,
Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan and Turkey, was formally launched in
1997 to promote multilateral cooperation. These countries are also
members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC).
</P>
<P>
Referring to criticism that D-8 will weaken the OIC, Azad said
no such problem arises since all endeavors of the newly-founded
body were directed to bring welfare to the people of member states.
It would rather support the endeavor of the OIC, the minister
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Describing the D-8 as an "outstanding example" of south-south
cooperation, Azad said that with all member states laying more
stress on privatization, deregulation and disinvestment of state-
owned enterprises, there is great potential and scope for
productive and meaningful cooperation.
</P>
<P>
There will be two working sessions at the meeting where the
participants will review the overall activities of D-8 since its
inception, particularly the developments after the second D-8
summit held here last March.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Said to Be Ready for Talks With India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Foreign Secretary
Inam ul Haq Tuesday said his country is ready for dialogue with
India to settle the long-standing Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
But it was out of question to vacate Azad (free) Jammu and
Kashmir, the Pakistan-administered part of Kashmir, he said.
</P>
<P>
Haq was replying to questions at his maiden press briefing at
the Foreign Office here after assuming the post of foreign
secretary recently.
</P>
<P>
Asked what are the chances of resumption of dialogue between
the two newest nuclear neighbors, Haq said, "That would depend on
the Indian government. Pakistan has declared its intention to
resume dialogue. It is up to India to respond."
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee Sunday said his
government will not reopen talks with Pakistan unless the latter "
returns" the area it controls to India.
</P>
<P>
On the Afghan issue, Haq said Chief Executive General Pervez
Musharraf will visit the war-torn neighbor but the dates have not
been finalized yet.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the visit, Haq said, is to promote bilateral
relations and promote the prospects of peace in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"In Afghanistan, we seek, as does the rest of the world,the end
of conflict and the establishment of a broad-based representative
government. In this endeavor we have supported and will continue
to support the efforts of the United Nations and the Organization
of the Islamic Conference," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in his opening statement, the foreign secretary said
Pakistan lives in a difficult environment and the quest for
security and peace has always been at the core of its foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
He deplored that the hostility between Pakistan and India
during the past half century has hindered the economic progress
and development and resulted in the lack of a peaceful environment
in the region.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, "Indian policy makers and leaders have become
increasingly strident in their pronouncements against Pakistan,"
Haq charged.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We have responded with a policy of restraint and
maturity and have expressed our willingness to resume dialogue
with India on the basis of sovereign equality for the settlement
of the core dispute of Jammu and Kashmir in accordance with the
wishes and aspirations of the people of Jammu and Kashmir."

<HEADLINE> WFP Ships Food to Afghan Opposition Stronghold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. World Food Program
(WFP) Tuesday sent 13 tons of food across Afghan front-lines to
stave off a severe food crisis in the embattled Panjshir valley,
stronghold of the opposition Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
According to a U.N. press release issued here, the shipment of
wheat flour was the first food aid to reach this isolated mountain
valley in eastern Afghanistan since early December.
</P>
<P>
Local agricultural production in the valley cannot meet the
food needs of both the 145,000 permanent residents there and the
50,000 people who arrived last year to escape fighting in northern
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
WFP had transported food to the valley by means of northern
access routes until early October last year, but those routes are
now closed by snow.
</P>
<P>
In December, WFP sent some 750 tons of food to the valley
across the front-lines separating the ruling Taliban militia and
the Northern Alliance's troops.
</P>
<P>
To feed the displaced people in the Panjshir valley, WFP is
faced with extraordinary transportation problems and delivery
trucks have to contend with very poor mountain roads, dangerous
front-lines and long, circuitous routes imposed by the region's
geography, said the press release.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Regrets Continued U.S. Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government said
Tuesday that it regretted the U.S. government's recent
announcement of continued broad sanctions against the country as
it has against more than 70 other nations around the world.
</P>
<P>
In its Information Sheet released here Tuesday night, the
Myanmar government also regretted the continued U.S. belief that
imposing sanctions and boycotts on Third World countries to slow
down their economic development will hasten their transition to
sustainable democracies.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. government also tends to understand that its policy
of putting extreme hardships and difficulties on the whole
population of those nations by way of deprivation, starvation and
denial of better life is doing a favor to the very people of those
countries,"it commented.
</P>
<P>
The Information Sheet blamed that those countries, which
reached the stage of early development, are hampering the peaceful
evolution Myanmar is going through at the initially critical stage
of its development.
</P>
<P>
It argued that human rights for a Third World country like
Myanmar means the rights to enjoy the basic human requirements
such as security, food and shelter.
</P>
<P>
It added that Myanmar has at present managed to fulfill these
basic human needs to a certain extent and has moved on to another
set of necessities in health and education as inner resources for
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the United States announced that it will maintain its
sanctions on Myanmar until it sees movements toward democracy,
respect for human rights and cooperation on counter-narcotic
efforts after Ralph Bovce, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of
state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, made a one-day visit to
Myanmar on February 17 this year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. sanctions against Myanmar include suspension of
economic aid, withdrawal of Myanmar from the General System of
Preferences and Overseas Private Investment Corporation programs,
implementation of an arms embargo, blocking of assistance from
international financial institutions, downgrading of U.S.
representation from ambassador to charge d'affaires, imposition of
visa restrictions on senior officials and their families and
institution of a ban on new investment by U.S. citizens.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Cyclone Eline began to weaken
as it moved inland in central Mozambique on Tuesday, the
Mozambican Meteorology Institute (INAM) announced.
</P>
<P>
It said that by the early afternoon, the cyclone was over the
central part of Manica Province, heading towards Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
INAM warned of winds of up to 60 kilometers an hour in Manica
and in the northern parts of Inhambane and Gaza provinces.
</P>
<P>
The cyclone is also bringing heavy rains to these areas as well
as to Sofala, over which it passed earlier in the day, and to the
southern part of Zambezia Province, the institute said.
</P>
<P>
According to reports on Radio Mozambique, the cyclone has
caused severe damage in the port city of Beira, ripping the roofs
off many flimsy homes, with one cyclone-related death reported.
</P>
<P>
The latest data released from the Southern Regional Water Board
 indicated that the Limpopo river was still on the rise, with the
level reaching 5.88 meters in Xai-Xai, capital of Gaza Province by

JOHANNESBURG, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Namibian Prime Minister
Hage Geingob Tuesday reiterated that his government would not
mediate the conflict between the Angolan government and the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), the
Namibian Press Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Geingob was reacting to opposition politicians who were calling
for the Namibian government to bridge talks between the Angolan
government and the UNITA rebels led by Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
The decision made by the government not to mediate the conflict
was based on the fact that Savimbi had been declared a war
criminal by the Southern African Development Community at its 1998
summit in Mauritius, the prime minister said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Vows to Restore Order in Riot City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo Tuesday vowed to restore order to the northern Nigerian
city of Kaduna, where clashes had killed at least 25 people.
</P>
<P>
"The government would do whatever is considered necessary to
restore law and order to Kaduna," said the president in the west
African country's capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
He expressed "distress and anguish" at the "avoidable
violence".
</P>
<P>
Local reports said the federal troops were seen in Kaduna on
Tuesday to help quell the spreading violence following Monday's
protests against Sharia law.
</P>
<P>
Kaduna police confirmed that the soldiers were from one
mechanized division based in the city.
</P>
<P>
In a broadcast late Monday, the state government, which has
imposed a " dusk-to-down" curfew in the city, said it was yet to
decide on the introduction of Sharia in the state, whose
population is almost equally split between Christians and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
In order to impose the curfew, the police were reportedly
forced to fire at some Muslim and Christian gangs, leaving corpses
on the streets.
</P>
<P>
Some 25 bodies had been picked up from the streets overnight, a
police source said earlier on Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Several buildings in the town, including churches and mosques,
were set on fire by the confronting gangs on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The violence flared up on Monday when Christians demonstrated
against the proposed introduction of Islamic Sharia law in the
state.
</P>
<P>
The Sharia issue has become increasingly explosive in Nigeria
since the northern state of Zamfara dominated by Moslems applied
the Islamic law last month.
</P>
<P>
Several other states have also announced their intention to
introduce Sharia, provoking protests in the most populous African
country where Christians are dominant.

to Beirut to demonstrate its support for Lebanon after Israel's
recent attack on the Arab state.
</P>
<P>
Arab League Secretary General Ahemd Esmat Abdel Meguid announced
the decision in a statement issued on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the move was meant to show solidarity
with Lebanon in the face of the recent Israeli attacks on Lebanese
civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
Israel blitzed three Lebanese power stations and injured 20
Lebanese civilians earlier this month to avenge Hebollah raids
against Israeli occupation forces in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli strikes on Lebanese civilian infrastructure has
unleashed a storm of criticism among the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed that the first item on the agenda of the
103rd session of the foreign minister council that is slated for
March 11-12 will be solidarity with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss had expressed welcome, over a
telephone conversation wednesday morning with Abdel Meguid, to the
holding of the council's new session in his country.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM Welcomes Arab Ministerial Meeting in Beirut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim
Hoss Wednesday welcomed the decision by the Arab League to hold its
next foreign ministerial meeting in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Hoss told reporters that he was relieved by the collective Arab
support for Lebanon in its hard times, adding that the support is
an evidence of Arab brotherhood and the justice of the Lebanese
cause.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League announced earlier in the day that its will
transfer the venue of its 103rd session of the foreign ministers
council that is slated for March 11-13 from Cairo to Beirut to
demonstrate the Arab support for Lebanon in the face of the recent
Israeli attacks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the month, Israel bombed three Lebanese power
stations, in which 20 Lebanese civilians were wounded, which
unleashed a storm of criticism among Arab states.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli blitz came for what Israel said avenging Lebanese
Hezbollah deadly attacks on Israeli occupation forces in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a border strip in south Lebanon in 1985 with a
claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese guerrillas'
cross-border attacks. Ever since Hezbollah, or Party of God, has
been spearheading a guerrilla war against the Israeli occupation
troops.
</P>
<P>
The tense situation in south Lebanon has also hindered the
resumption of the stalled Syrian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
But Hoss said that the danger of a new Israeli strike has
somewhat retreated.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Speaker Urges European Pressure on Israel to Revive Peace process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of Jordanian Senate
(upper house of parliament) Zeid Rifai on Wednesday called on the
European Union (EU) to urge Israel to resume peace talks with its
Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He made the call in a meeting with President of the European
Parliament Nicole Fontaine and her accompanying delegation which is
visiting Jordan over bilateral ties and the peace process in the
region.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Rifai stressed there will be no genuine peace
in the region unless the peace is just and comprehensive.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed Jordan's stand that the Palestinian issue is the
core element in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom supports the rights of Palestinians, including the
establishment of an independent state with Jerusalem as its
capital.
</P>
<P>
On Lebanon, Rifai said Israel's massive air raids earlier this
month, which left dozens of civilians injured, have escalated
tensions and posed a grave threat to the peace process, stability
and security in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said Jordan supports Lebanon and Syria in their efforts to
restore their territories in accordance with international laws and
resolutions of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
For her part, Fontaine said her parliament, the supervisory and
consultative body of the European Union (EU), is ready to further
enhance its ties with the Jordanian senate as the kingdom has been
a "distinguished partner" of the EU.
</P>
<P>
Rifai said the visit by Fontaine will pave the way for further
consultations between Jordan and the European Parliament over
bilateral ties and developments in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Fontaine visited Jordan at a time when a impasse occurred in the
peace talks between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Syrian talks were suspended indefinitely last month
after Syria demanded Israel provide a written commitment to handing
back in full the Golan Heights it captured in the 1967 Middle East
war.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators also failed to meet a
February 13 deadline to lay down a framework for a final peace
agreement to be signed by September.
</P>
<P>
For years, Jordan has been an active peace broker between Israel
and its Arab neighbors after the kingdom signed a peace treaty with
Israel in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Business Delegation to Visit Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish delegation including
140 businessmen will go to Iraq to attend a Joint Economic
Commission (JEC) meeting to be held between February 26 and March
1, the Turkish Foreign Trade Undersecretariat said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will make contact with with the representatives
of the Iraqi governmental and private sectors to discuss how to
increase the bilateral trade volume.
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials said Turkey attaches importance to the
improvement of the trade relations with neighboring countries and
it has a significant place in the Iraqi market.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is looking to neighboring countries to increase its
exports during this year. It has plans to send its trade
delegations to visit Iraq, Iran and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's trade volume with its neighbors has declined since
1980. The share taken by neighboring countries of Turkey's total
trade volume decreased from 11.8 percent in 1980 to 8.1 percent in
1990 and 3.7 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials attributed political instability, tension in
bilateral relations and comparatively lower industrialization of
its southern neighboring countries, to the decline of the trade
volume.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and its southern neighboring Iraq, Iran and Syria have
been at odds over disputes on territory, water resources and issue
of Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Turkey accused the three countries of supporting the PKK, which
has been fighting since 1984 for an independent Kurdish state in
southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Syria, the downstream countries of Tigris and Euphrates
Rivers, are opposed to Turkey's plan to build dams across the
rivers, fearing that Turkey, the upstream country of the rivers,
can use water as a weapon against them in case of tension.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, Turkey has improved regional security
environment to concentrate on economy. Turkish officials said they
should learn from European countries to boost commercial potential
with its neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Tsohatzopoulos: Greece Can Deal With Turkish Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos said Wednesday that Greece had the ability to deal
in the best possible way with the Turkish threat.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos made the remark while addressing a conference on
the military science and art in the third millennium.
</P>
<P>
After the December EU summit in Helsinki, it was obvious that
the unilateral demands on behalf of Turkey could be invalidated,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that no one could stop Cyprus' entry into the EU
and there was a will by the international community to impose a
change in the stance of Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot community.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Greece and Turkey have been strained for
decades over their territorial dispute in the eastern Aegean Sea
and the Cyprus problem, but the two neighboring countries have
since last June improved their relations, with the exchange of
visits by their foreign ministers and the signing of nine
agreements for bilateral cooperation in a variety of sectors.
</P>
<P>
Although the bilateral ties between the long-time rivals have
been significantly improved thanks to the efforts by the two
countries, their problems concerning the sovereignty over the
Aegean and the way of solving the Cyprus problem still exist.
</P>
<P>
Greece has rejected Turkish demands for negotiations over
sovereignty in the Aegean, saying that Athens has no dispute with
Turkey in the Aegean.

UNITED NATIONS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The International Force
in East Timor (INTERFET) was formally replaced by the United
Nations peacekeeping force in Dili, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Transitional Administrator Sergo Vieira de Mello,
INTERFET Commander Gen. Peter Cosgrove and U.N. Force Commander

INTERFET, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the remaining administrative and financial
transfer would occur at midnight on February 28.
</P>
<P>
NTERFET was deployed in East Timor on September 20, 1999, as
an emergency response to a campaign of killing, burning and
intimidation by pro-Indonesia militias after the territory voted
on August 30, 1999 to become independent.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations helps to prepare East Timor for self rule
within three year.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard also said that The United Nations Transitional
Administration, on behalf of East Timor, signed with Australia
today an agreement on gas exploration in the joint zone of the
Timor Gap area, known as Byun Undan.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, Philips Petroleum of the United

<HEADLINE> Two Formal Candidates Nominated for Post of IMF Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) announced Wednesday that Stanley Fischer, a naturalized
American who is the fund's acting managing director, and former
Japanese finance ministry official Eisuke Sakakibara were the
first formal candidates to replace Michel Camdessus as head of the
international lender.
</P>
<P>
Fisher was nominated for the post by IMF board member Jose
Pedro de Morais, who represents 20 African countries including
South Africa and Zambia, where Fisher was born.
</P>
<P>
"I put forward for the consideration of my colleagues the
nomination of Mr. Stanley Fischer, our highly regarded first
deputy managing director, to succeed Mr. Michel Camdessus as
managing director...for a full five-year term," Morais said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"The former managing director made his request (to resign) 115
days ago. His distinguished term came to an end over a week ago
and we have now entered a period of uncertainty an instability
which we could all do well without," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yukio Yoshimura, Japan's executive director at the IMF,
nominated Sakakibara in a separate statement.
</P>
<P>
"Japan considers Mr. Sakakibara would be the most qualified
leader of the IMF, especially during the period of reform," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The two nominations are a clear snub to Europeans who have
insisted that the IMF post should go to a European -- every
previous head of the international lender has come from Europe and
the continent regards the IMF as its by right.
</P>
<P>
European ministers have held a series of rounds of negotiations,
but have so far failed to agree a single European candidate to
replace Camdessus at the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Germany said on Wednesday that it expected to nominate finance
ministry official Caio Koch-Weser next week, and a spokesman said
he was confident that Koch-Weser would win the support of a
majority on the IMF board, which is responsible for appointing a
successor.
</P>
<P>
IMF sources were quoted by the Reuters as saying that no date
had been set for the fund's board to vote on the succession. But
they said things could move rapidly once all the nominations were
in.

<HEADLINE> PLO Supports Lebanon Against Israeli Attacks: Palestinian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) and the Palestinians stand by the Lebanese
people after Israel launched attacks on Lebanon earlier this month,
a senior Palestinian official said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Farouk Kaddoumi, head of the PLO political department, who
arrived here earlier in the day from Syria, made the remarks after
talks with Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss.
</P>
<P>
Kaddoumi said his visit to Lebanon aims mainly at expressing the
PLO and Palestinian people's support for Lebanon, whose three power
stations were bombed and 20 civilians wounded earlier this month by
Israel in retaliation for Hezbollah attacks on Israeli occupation
forces.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with a
claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese guerrillas cross-
border attacks.
</P>
<P>
It was the resistance's painful attacks that forced Israel to
speak of its intention to withdraw from south Lebanon, Kaddoumi
said.
</P>
<P>
Kaddoumi also said that Arafat, who led a guerrilla war against
Israel from Beirut in the 1970s, wants to visit Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has not returned to Lebanon since a failed attempt to
reestablish himself in 1983. His 1993 peace deal with Israel
angered Syria, Lebanon's power broker.

<HEADLINE> Israel Praises PNA for Cooperation in Fighting Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior Israeli defense
official Wednesday praised the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
for its cooperation in fighting terrorism, saying it has "
substantial share" in Israel's recent success in foiling terror
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh denied charges leveled by
opposition Likud party that PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat had given a
new green light to a recent upsurge of terrorist activities against
Israelis. "It is not true, it's not true," he told Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
"They (the Palestinians) cooperated. They have a substantial
share in the success (in curbing these activities)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sneh made the remarks one day after Israel's General Security
Service (GSS) announced that with the cooperation of the PNA,
Israel had smashed an underground cell of the Islamic militant
group Hamas which had planned to blow up large residential
buildings and buses in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few weeks, Israel and the PNA had arrested dozens
of activists of the cell which was found responsible for a series
of bombing attacks in Israel in the last several months, the GSS
said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 50 people were wounded in two of these attacks, one in
the northern coastal city of Netanya in November and one in the
nearby city of Hadera in January.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami warned Wednesday that
there has been a new wave of terrorist activities against Israelis
as a result of the recent deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Both Sneh and Ben-Ami stressed that Israel has to move ahead the
peace talks with the Palestinians in order to curb the rising
terror activities. "It's in the interests of both sides," Sneh
said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli intelligence agencies have warned recently that if no
progress was made in the peace talks with the Palestinians, Israel
might face another Intifada -- the Palestinian uprising between
1987-1993 during which the two sides clashed violently on the
streets.
</P>
<P>
To show their disappointment over the impasse in the peace
talks, dozens of Palestinian youths took to the streets in the West
Bank cities of Ramallah and Nablus on Tuesday and clashed with
Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, a Palestinian youth was arrested in Jerusalem
after he stabbed a religious Jew, slightly injuring his shoulder,
and tried to stab another Israeli man.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations ground to a halt
early this month over a dispute about an overdue Israeli troop
withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
United States Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross is in the
region in a fresh bid to narrow the gaps between the two sides and
help resume the stalled talks. But there has so far no sign of a
breakthrough.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Urges European Efforts to Revive Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdel
Rauf Rawabdeh on Wednesday called for European efforts to help
break the deadlock in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal during a meeting with President of the
European Parliament Nicole Fontaine and her accompanying delegation
which arrived here earlier in the day for a brief visit over
bilateral ties and the peace process in the region.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh said Europe could play an important role in pushing
ahead the peace process and bring it back on track, particularly at
a time when an impasse occurred in Israel's peace talks with its
Arab neighbors, including the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been postponed indefinitely
last month over Syrian demand for an Israeli written commitment to
hand back in full the Golan Heights it captured in the 1967 Middle
East War.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators also failed to meet a
February 13 deadline to seal a framework agreement to lay ground
for a final peace agreement that is scheduled to be signed by
September.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese peace process has not been resumed since it broke
down in 1996.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Rawabdeh stressed Jordan's keenness to
strengthen cooperation with the European Parliament, the
supervisory and advisory body of the European Union, on bilateral
issues and the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
For her part, Fontaine commended Jordan's efforts towards
security, stability and peace in the region, Jordan's official news
agency Petra said.
</P>
<P>
She also praised Jordan's efforts to accommodate Palestinian
refugees during several Arab-Israeli wars. The kingdom is now home
to some 1.2 million Palestinian refugees, most of whom have been
granted Jordanian citizenships.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government said it supported the rights of the
Palestinian refugees to choose between returning to their homeland
or asking for compensation from parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
Fontaine said her parliament was keen to enhance its ties with
the kingdom, and EU member countries were planning joint ventures
in the kingdom to help its economic development.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been a major peace broker between Israel and its Arab
neighbors since it signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, the
second Arab country to sign a peace treaty with the Jewish state
next to Egypt.

keen to maintain stability of the world oil market, but refrained
from announcing a clear future oil policy.
</P>
<P>
"By looking at expectations of world oil supply and demand of
the current year, the GCC states will work in cooperation with
other producers to find ways of achieving a balanced market," said
a final statement issued after a meeting of the GCC oil ministers
held in the Saudi capital of Riyadh earlier Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ministers expressed content over the tangible improvement of
oil prices which they said was a result of the initiative of their
countries to specify the production for the sake of restoring
market balance.
</P>
<P>
But they failed to make public in the statement their positions
on future oil production.
</P>
<P>
Oil business analysts believed that the GCC states, namely
Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the Untied Arab
Emirates, were trying to avoid toning the overall strategy of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), before an
OPEC ministerial meeting due in Brussels later next month.
</P>
<P>
OPEC oil ministers will meet on March 27 to decide the policy of
the next period as the current production curbs agreement expires
later in March. OPEC members reached the one-year accord last March
to slash their daily output by 1.7 million barrels in an attempt to
lift the then sagging oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The measure has so far succeeded in pushing the prices in the
world oil market to their highest since 1991. Prices for benchmark
Brent crude surged to nearly 29 U.S. dollars per barrel in mid-
February before sliding back a little last week.
</P>
<P>
The GCC meeting was also convened ahead of a planned visit to
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, two major OPEC members, by U.S. Secretary
of Energy Bill Richardson over oil production and oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Oil producers are coming under mounting pressure from key
consumers such as the United States, which called for raising
output as world stockpiles fall and prices keep rising.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton also voiced concern over the current
conditions on the world oil market.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said in Mexico last Saturday that he did not want to
release the U.S. strategic crude reserves on to the world market,
but that oil prices at 30 dollars a barrel were too high.
</P>
<P>
However, Gulf producers including non-Arab Iran have so far
demonstrated no signs of increasing their output beyond March.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Reaffirms Support for Lebanon in Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein said Wednesday his country would provide all possible
assistance to Lebanon in face of the deadlocks in the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The monarch made the pledge in a telephone conversation with
Lebanese President Emile Lahoud over bilateral ties and the peace
process in the region, Jordan's official news agency Petra said.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud hailed Jordan's support and affirmed Lebanon's keenness
to boost and consolidate ties between the two countries, Petra
said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also agreed to increase exchanges of visits by
officials of the two countries over bilateral cooperation and the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah has on many occasions voiced his support for Lebanon to
regain its territories and sovereignty in the peace process in
accordance with resolutions of the United Nations on Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Jordan also condemned Israel's massive air raids on Lebanon
earlier this month which injured dozens of civilians.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli bombardments were carried out in retaliation against
attacks on Israeli targets by the Iran-backed Hezbollah, or Party
of God, which killed seven Israeli soldiers this year.
</P>
<P>
For years, Hezbollah has been spearheading a resistance campaign
against Israeli occupation in south Lebanon, where Israel carved
out a self-styled buffer zone allegedly to protect its north from
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's telephone conversation between Abdullah and Lahoud
came at a time when an impasse occurred in Israel's peace talks
with the Palestinians and Syria, a major power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have failed to meet a
February 13 deadline to hammer out a framework for a final peace
agreement to be sealed by September.
</P>
<P>
The Israel-Syria peace talks were postponed indefinitely last
month after Syria insisted on a written commitment from Israel to
handing back in full the Golan Heights it captured in the 1967
Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been a major peace broker between Israel and its Arab
neighbors since it signed a peace treaty with the Jewish state in
1994.

On Monday, Zametalin and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister and Finance
Minister Hikmat al-Azzawi co-chaired the first session of the
Iraqi-Belarussian Joint Committee for Trade and Economic
Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed bilateral cooperation within the
framework of the oil-for-food program which allows Iraq to sell oil
and use the revenue to buy humanitarian goods for its people
reeling under the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq in 1990 following
its invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Prodi, Blair Condemn Bomb Attack in Spain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- European Commission President
Romano Prodi and British Prime Minister Tony Blair Wednesday
expressed their angry about bomb attack on Tuesday in Spain's
Basque Country which killed two men.
</P>
<P>
"This violence is an attack on man's fundamental rights," Prodi
said. "There can be no justification for attacks in democratic
nations, even less so assassinations."
</P>
<P>
"We are very, very worried and sad at this escalation of
terrorism," said the chief of the European Union (EU) executive. "
We shall back all democratic forces fighting against this," he
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting here with officials of the EU executive,
Blair said "We in Britain feel an immense sense of solidarity with
people in Spain in the light of this latest terrorist outrage."
</P>
<P>
"We know, we have learnt that the way to peace and democracy
never lies through violence," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope very much the Spanish people, as they come to terms
with this latest attack, realize they have the full support and
solidarity of people in Europe and around the world," Blair added.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a leading Socialist politician and his bodyguard
were killed by a powerful car bomb in the Basque capital Vitoria.
A separatist group, ETA, which ended its 14-month truce in early
last December, was blamed for the terrorist attack.

<HEADLINE> Russia Sends Reinforcement to Southern Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal troops brought
in enforcement Wednesday to the southern mountainous regions of
Chechnya amid reports of ferocious attempts by rebels to break
across the border to neighboring Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Mi-8 helicopters airlifted 200 soldiers to reinforce the border
near the village of Omi- Chu, scene of fierce fighting Tuesday,
the Interfax news agency reported, citing the united federal
headquarters in the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
Three Russian border guards were killed outside Omi-Chu Tuesday
when Chechen militants tried to fight their way from the Argun
gorge into Georgia, Russian media reported.
</P>
<P>
Fierce fighting is also reportedly going on near the southern
village of Shatoi, where the main militant forces have
concentrated, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday marks the 56th anniversary of the start of mass
deportation of ethnic Chechens to Central Asia during the Second
World War and security has been heightened across Russia and
especially inside the breakaway republic, amid reports of planned
terrorist attacks by Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
The administrative border between Chechnya and the neighboring
Russian constituent republics remained closed Wednesday, so were
all checkpoints along the Chechen border, Interfax said, quoting
the Interior Ministry's temporary press center in the North
Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, federal forces are unleashing more air strikes on
the rebels in the mountains, with 120 combat missions reported
over Chechnya in the past 24 hours, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Su-24 bombers, Su-25 attack jets and Mi-24 helicopter gunships
attacked militant positions in the Argun gorge, and 19 rebel
strongholds, seven fortified positions, four firing positions, two
anti-aircraft installations, two communications facilities, five
vehicles and four mortars were reportedly hit in the raids.
</P>
<P>
At least 130 rebels were killed near the Argun gorge in the
past 24 hours, Interfax quoted the federal headquarters as saying
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
No casualty figures were given for Russian federal forces, but
the Defense Ministry has confirmed that a Mi-24 helicopter was
shot down Tuesday during fierce fighting in the Argun gorge area.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Newbridge Merged by Alcatel SA of France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- In an all-stock deal of 7.1
billion U.S. dollars, Canada's Newbridge Networks Corp. has fallen
into the arms of Alcatel SA of France.
</P>
<P>
The French telecommunications equipment supplier announced its
ever biggest acquisition Wednesday in Paris, saying it offers 0.81
of a share of its U.S. stock for each Newbridge share.
</P>
<P>
The deal is expected to complete in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts in Ottawa say that Alcatel bought Newbridge for its
portfolio of telecommunications equipment to build Internet
networks.
</P>
<P>
Newbridge, which is second only to Nortel Networks Ltd. in
Canada, produces switches and wireless products for Internet
service providers, phone companies and cable TV in more than 100
countries.
</P>
<P>
Alcatel expects the merge to bring in a two-fold increase to 2.
5 billion dollars in annual revenues for its data carrier division.
</P>
<P>
The Ottawa-based new entity will boost Alcatel's competition
with telecom giants, including Cisco Systems Inc., Lucent
Technologies Inc.and Nortel Networks Corp. in the U.S. market,
which represents at least a fifth of Alcatel's sales.
</P>
<P>
Newbridge was founded by a competitive Welshman Terry Mathews
14 years ago. The company's success has made Matthews one of
Britain's 20 richest men.
</P>
<P>
The company saw its reputation tarnished in the past two years
by management difficulties, disappointing earnings and increasing
competition from larger U.S.-based rivals.
</P>
<P>
Newbridge began seeking a buyer last November while laying off
10 percent of its work force of 6,000, of whom nearly half are in
its Kanata headquarters near Ottawa.

<HEADLINE> EU Report Makes Public U.S.-led Espionage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A communications monitoring
network led by the United States is intercepting "billions of
messages per hour" through telephone calls, fax transmissions and
private e-mails, according to a European Parliament report made
public Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The level of use is getting out of control," said Ducan
Campbell, author of the special parliament-commissioned report on
the Echelon spy-network, told a hearing of the European Union (EU)
's parliament Committee for Justice and Home Affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said "the capacity of the filtering system is enormous" and
that most international Internet communications are being routed
through the United States and through nine known U.S. National
Security Agency interception sites.
</P>
<P>
Campbell said Canada, Britain, Australia and New Zealand are
also involved in Echelon while other countries including France
and Germany participated in a lower level in the spy-network which
covered the whole period of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
He also said intelligence facilities located in those countries
can intercept fax, e-mail or telephone communications easily.
Microsoft,IBM and a certain "large American microchip maker" were
providing certain product features which allow the interception of
information flow, Campbell added.
</P>
<P>
Campbell said he did not know whether the American corporations
were benefiting from the information collecting, but said previous
commercial espionage resulted in the collapse of several European
contracts in the airline industry -- both military and commercial.
</P>
<P>
He urged the EU to take action to protect against unwanted
interception of communications.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Launches Polio Campaign in Nuba Mountains in Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A program to immunize
77,000 children against polio was launched Wednesday in the Nuba
Mountains region of Sudan as part of a campaign to vaccinate all
children under five throughout the African country, U.N. officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The Nuba Mountains portion of the polio drive marks the first
time in almost 19 years that the United Nations has gained access
to deliver humanitarian relief in all parts of this contested
region.
</P>
<P>
The polio campaign is being facilitated by the U.N. Children's
Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO), the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
While U.N. agencies have conducted two recent assessment
missions to the Nuba Mountains, this is the first time that the
Government has approved the delivery of U.N. assistance to people
living in the rebel-controlled areas of Nuba Mountains, where the
people have suffered more than a decade of civil conflict.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the support of the Government of Sudan and the
Sudanese People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) to extend the polio
immunization campaign to children in the conflict-plagued Nuba
Mountains, Thomas Ekvail, UNICEF Representative to Khartoum, said,
"The survival, protection and development of all of Sudan's
children, not just some, are central to UNCIEF's mandate and
program in Sudan, and we are very pleased with this opportunity."
</P>
<P>
The operation, valued at half a million U.S. dollars, has been
made possible by negotiations between the United Nations,
Government of Sudan, and the SPLM, which led to declarations by
the warring parties of a "window of tranquillity" during which
hostilities would cease and immunization could be carried out. The
days of tranquillity are expected to last through the end of the
month.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations hopes to immunize a total of 5.4 million
children in Sudan during the present campaign, including 77,000 in
the Nuba region.
</P>
<P>
The campaign in the Nuba Mountains is a component of the Sudan
National Immunization Days (NIDs) and part of the global programs
for polio eradication. In Sudan, the NIDs are coordinated by
Sudanese authorities, UNICEF and WHO.
</P>
<P>
The national campaign kicked off in Sudan last Thursday, and
will continue through the end of the week.

<P>
BERLIN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder appealed Wednesday for equal opportunity for access to
the new information technologies becoming available before the
opening of the worldwide famous CeBIT 2000 in Hanover.
</P>
<P>
 At the opening ceremony of the office equipment and computer
technology fair CeBIT 2000, Schroeder said that "information
competency" was a task for society as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder stressed that all people should have the chance to
have access to modern communications technologies and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said:"Our country should, in this information age,
assume a top position in international competition. I am certain
that we will succeed in this."
</P>
<P>
Schroeder praised Deutsche Telekom for its plans to provide
all German schools with digitalised ISDN access to the Internet
free of charge.
</P>
<P>
But Chancellor Schroeder warned of the dangers of a gap
between those who could grasp the opportunities provided by the
Internet and those who had not yet done so.
</P>
<P>
This year, 7800 exhibitors are expected to attend the fair.
The fair will be open officially on February 24 and finish on
March 1. The organizers estimate about 700,000 visitors will come
to watch the CeBIT.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A team of four experts sent by
the World Health Organization (WHO) is assessing the situations in
flooded areas in Mozambique in order to provide technical support
to the country in its emergency relief operations.
</P>
<P>
The WHO experts in public health, epidemiology, malariology,
nutrition and sanitary engineering plus six members from the WHO
representative office are working in close collaboration with
other partners, according to a WHO press release Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Due to recent floods in the African country, around 800,000
people have been put at risk, of whom 220,000 are estimated
displaced, said WHO. Six provinces have been so far affected by
the floods.
</P>
<P>
The more severely affected population is still without access
to safe drinking water, health care and other basic services.
According to WHO estimates, of the 220,000 displaced people, 44,
000 are children under five years of age and 11,220 are pregnant
women with 3,400 of them expected to deliver within the coming
three months.
</P>
<P>
WHO said that most of the needs of the affected population (
food,water, shelter, health care, sanitation), remained unmet,
adding that the situation is expected to worsen as the rains
continue and with the virtual isolation of some of the flooded
areas.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Council Welcomes Indonesia's Commitment On East Timor Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Wednesday welcomed the commitment of the
Government of Indonesia to bring those responsible for violations
of international humanitarian and human rights law in East Timor
to justice through Indonesia's national judicial system.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Council
President Arnoldo Manuel Lister said the Council members encourage
Indonesia to institute a swift, comprehensive, effective and
transparent legal process, in conformity with international
standards of justice and due process of law.
</P>
<P>
Council members recognize that the accountability of those
responsible for the aforementioned violations would be a key
factor in ensuring reconciliation and stability in East Timor, the
President said.
</P>
<P>
The Council members are particularly conscious that early and
effective action by the Government of Indonesia would contribute
to improve relations between the peoples of Indonesia and East
Timor, he said.
</P>
<P>
The International Commission of Inquiry on East Timor
established by the United Nations issued a report last month,
saying grave violations of international humanitarian and human
rights law have been committed in East Timor and those responsible
for these violations should be brought to justice as soon as
possible. It recommended an international tribunal be set up to
try those responsible.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the report, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of
Indonesia, Alwi Shihab, wrote to the U.N. chief Kofi Annan,
stressing that it was up to the Government of Indonesia to bring
those responsible to justice through Indonesia's national judicial
system.

<HEADLINE> Sabena Carries Record Passengers in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Belgian national carrier
Sabena hit a record last year of carrying more than 10 million
passengers but still could not turn around its loss-making streak.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian airline announced on Wednesday that its passenger
traffic in 1999 increased 13.9 percent to break the barrier of 10
million for the first time since the airline started air service
in 1925.
</P>
<P>
For three years in a row, Sabena has scored above-average
increase of passenger traffic as against its European competitors.
</P>
<P>
The turnover of Sabena in 1999 stood at 2.23 billion euro (2.16
billion U.S. dollars), a 3-percent increase compared with the
previous year. The increase mainly resulted from both passenger
traffic and such industrial activities as catering, cargo and
ground handlings.
</P>
<P>
But the increase of turnover was neutralized by the company's
restructuring costs that accounted for 6 million euro (5.82
million dollars). The Belgian airline ended up in the red with 14
million euro (13.58 million dollars) for the past year.
</P>
<P>
The deficit, however, was 8 million euro (7.76 million dollars)
less than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Sabena, in cooperation with Swissair, now has a fleet of 84
aircraft and its flights reach 81 cities in Europe and 28 cities
outside Europe. It is forging a new partnership with an American
airline after Delta left their cooperation that concentrates on
trans-Atlantic flights.

<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- South African Finance
Minister Trevor Manuel said on Wednesday that his country's tax
regime would be reformed to stimulate growth and development, and
brought in line with international practice.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the 2000/01 budget, Manuel said all taxpayers will
benefit from a 9.9- billion-rand (1.57 billion U.S. dollars) tax
relief package, and the tax-free allowance on savings will rise.
</P>
<P>
He said the projected 9.9 billion rand would be put back into
people' s pockets through rate cuts and a restructuring of the
income tax brackets.
</P>
<P>
"A key objective of our economic policy is to reduce the tax
burden on ordinary people."
</P>
<P>
Those older than 65 would not pay tax on income less than
36,538 rand (5,800 dollars) a year, Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
"These adjustments should promote a culture of saving in our
country. Increasing the overall level of savings in our economy is
exceedingly important if we are to generate the levels of
investment required for job creation," Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
The government would also shift its system from a source-based
to a residence-based income tax.
</P>
<P>
South African residents working abroad would, starting in
2001, pay local tax rates. They would receive a credit for tax
paid in the country of employment, but would be charged the
difference by the South African tax authorities.
</P>
<P>
As an interim measure, foreign source dividends accruing to
South African residents would be taxable as ordinary income.

NAIROBI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi Wednesday lauded the improved relations between Kenya and the
United States as a result of his visit and discussions with
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Moi made the remarks on his arrival at the international
airport in the capital Nairobi from Washington where he attended
the Afro-American Summit on Africa, according to a press release
from the Presidential Press Service.
</P>
<P>
He said that the outcome of the summit will augur well for the
economic and political fields as well as security and the well
being of the African continent.
</P>
<P>
America and the world now understood Kenya's position in regard
to its economic and political changes, the president said.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with the officials from the U.S. treasury,
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank during
the summit, Moi said, problems facing Africa at present could be
taken seriously by the international community.
</P>
<P>
Kenya will closely work with the U.S., the IMF, the World Bank
and the European Union to forge ahead with development needs of
its people, Moi said.
</P>
<P>
Moi also expressed his hope that the second visit by the IFM
team in his country next month will bear fruits.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the IMF sent a team for a two-week fact-finding
mission in Kenya in preparation for the resumption of aid talks
with the Kenyan government. The IMF suspended a 205-million-U.S.
dollar loan to Kenya in July 1997 for the reasons of poor
governance and corruption.

LUSAKA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) has called on African Countries to join hands and
eliminate illicit drug trade which has undermined the prospects
for sustainable development and political stability in most of the
African countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch of the International Narcotics Control
Board 1999 report here on Wednesday, UNDP Resident Coordinator and
UN Resident Representative Olubanke King-Akerele said drugs had
contributed greatly to irresponsible behavior among the youths and
to the increase in the poverty levels of the African countries.
</P>
<P>
King-Akerele attributed abuse of drugs among the youths to the
increase in social pressure and limited amenities.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to disseminate information on the dangers of
drug abuse as wide as possible because knowledge is among the most
powerful tools we can avail to people to empower them to make
informed decisions," she said.
</P>
<P>
She added that Zambia should be in the forefront formulating
policies of tackling the illicit drugs which had also contributed
to the deadly disease AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Two Germans indicted for selling missile secrets to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Two German citizens would be
put on trial for  selling German missile designs to Russia, the
German prosecutor-general said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
 One is a 40-year-old industrial executive who visited Moscow
nearly every month and received at least 290,000 marks(145,000 U.S.
dollars) from Russia. Less than half of the sum was paid to his
source, a 52-year-old customer-service engineer who worked for LKF-
Lenkflugsysteme, a subsidiary of DaimlerChrysler Aerospace (DASA)
that is located in the Bavarian town of Ottobrunn.
</P>
<P>
The investigators believe that these two Germans sold
documents about anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles from 1997 on.
</P>
<P>
The industrial executive was already arrested last July as he
was boarding a plane in the town of Hannover to fly to Russia. He
is still in custody. When the 52-year-old engineer was arrested,
he had a further 100 documents ready to send to the Russian
according to the prosecutor-general.
</P>
<P>
The two are to be tried at a state superior court in Celle,
northern Germany, Prosecutor-General Kay Nehm said at his office
in Karlsruhe.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Angered by NATO Plan of Exercises Without Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Wednesday voiced
anger over NATO's plan to hold joint exercises in Kosovo without
Russia.
</P>
<P>
"This kind of decision can only be seen as an attempt to
diminish Russia's role in the peacekeeping operation" in the
Yugoslav province, Colonel General Leonid Ivashov, head of the
Russian Defense Ministry's Main Department for International
Military Cooperation, said.
</P>
<P>
"This hampers the establishment of broader contacts between
Russia and NATO in settling the situation in Kosovo, and in the
broader context as well," the Interfax news agency quoted him as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Russia-NATO ties, frozen last March when NATO launched a 78-day
airstrikes on Yugoslavia, showed signs of improvement recently
with a visit to Moscow earlier this month by George Robertson, the
secretary general of the 19-member transatlantic alliance.
</P>
<P>
Ivashov said that "by organizing these exercises NATO is trying
to put pressure on the Yugoslav leadership in order to change its
structure and political orientation."
</P>
<P>
Russia has not received any invitation to take part in the
exercises, although they will involve not only NATO member-states,
but also other countries whose representatives are taking part in
the peacekeeping operation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
About 3,600 Russian troops are stationed in Kosovo as part of a
multinational force, or KFOR.

<HEADLINE> Election in Northern German State to Be Test for CDU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The election in northern
Germany's Schleswig- Holstein state scheduled for Sunday is
expected to give voters a chance to judge the Christian Democratic
Union (CDU) since the party was reeled into a big financial
scandal from last November.
</P>
<P>
The state election will also be a tough test for former German
Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, who wants to take over the CDU's
leadership and run for chancellery in 2002.
</P>
<P>
The candidate of the CDU, Ruehe, 57, races against incumbent
State Prime Minister Heide Simonis, of the Social Democratic Party
(SPD), a trusted follower of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
According to polls, the CDU fell behind the SPD.
</P>
<P>
The financial scandal of the CDU means a gift in time for the
SPD. In Berlin, SPD officials refer to the CDU scandal as "a
political gift from heaven."
</P>
<P>
Until November 1999, Ruehe was still leading with as much as 47
percent in the opinion polls in Schleswig-Holstein. The CDU was in
a stunning recovery after it was defeated by the SPD and the
Greens in the election in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, the CDU's financial scandal broke out last November
and brought discredit on the union. The affair destroyed Ruehe's
lead and the three most recent polls now put the SPD at 44 to 45
percent, compared to 33 to 37 percent for Ruehe's CDU.
</P>
<P>
Simonis is quite confident at present and Chancellor Schroeder
also came to Kiel, the capital of the state, to help her campaign.
</P>
<P>
Simonis, who is well-known for her sharp tongue, says: "It is
no fun having an opponent who is exhausted."
</P>
<P>
Ruehe has no choice but almost to beg for votes: "To those who
want to punish the CDU I can only say the CDU already has been
punished."
</P>
<P>
After big defeats last year in seven states, the SPD and the
Greens have got a very favorable chance for consolidating their
positions. Besides the state election in Schleswig-Holstein,
another one will be held on May 14 in the state of North-Rhine-
Westphalia.

<P>
LONDON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian international
Celestine Babayaro has finally returned to his English premier
league club Chelsea after the African National Cup.

Babayaro arrived in England on Tuesday, and he was given one
day off by Chelsea to recover from tiredness, local paper said.

that Babayaro had gone to ground suffering from malaria.
</P>
<P>
"He's back and he's in good health," Williams said on Wednesday.
"We will be having a chat with him soon about what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
"Should we find he has been in the wrong - and I am not saying
he was - then we will take the appropriate action. But it is an
internal matter and that is how we will deal with it."
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Arsenal said that the club were always
expecting striker Kanu to return at the beginning of the week.
</P>
<P>
According to British media reports, Kanu claimed he stayed on
in Nigeria to look after his sick mother.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The east China city of
Shanghai today announced that construction of an Information Port
to develop local information technologies is the municipality's
top priority among its 30 key projects planned for this year.
</P>
<P>
According to a working conference on Shanghai's key projects
held today in the city, this was the first time Shanghai has
listed a high-tech project at the top of its agenda.
</P>
<P>
For more than a decade, Shanghai had given top priority to
housing and highway construction, among other infrastructure
projects.
</P>
<P>
The Information Port will include the creation of broadband
electronic networks and computer centers in the city, aimed at
boosting the local information technology.
</P>
<P>
The 30 key construction projects this year are mainly
government-funded projects, with highways, railways, and
environmental protection projects accounting for 60 percent of
them.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai plans to build 120 kilometers of highways and 80
kilometers of railways this year, according to the meeting.

<P>
Investment in environmental protection projects account for 15
percent of the total, much higher than in previous years, they

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Share prices climbed up on
the Singapore Stock Market Wednesday as blue-chip bargain-hunting
propped up the broader index.

end at 2,137.7.
</P>
<P>
The total turnover stood at 491.82 million units valued at 831.

MOSCOW, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian Acting President
Vladimir Putin met Wednesday with visiting British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook and the two sides agreed to intensify
economic and political ties and cooperation in combating
international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In what was described as an "involved and open" discussion

the two sides emphasized the need to have dialog to address the
weakened bilateral ties in the wake of NATO air strikes against
Yugoslavia, which London actively orchestrated and Moscow
staunchly opposed.
</P>
<P>
Putin briefed Cook on the current stage of the anti-terrorist
operation and the British foreign secretary welcomed the
appointment of a special presidential representative for human
rights in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Britain urged Russia to be as open as possible in cooperating
with the international community in resolving the Chechnya problem,
Cook told reporters following his meetings with Putin and Russian
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the international community can make its
contribution to a Chechnya settlement, and could help ease the
suffering of the Chechen people, adding that both Russia and
Britain are interested in restoring stability and security in the
Caucasus, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Cook said Britain has had its own bitter experience in
combating terrorism and knows very well the threat poses to Russia.
British experience shows that terrorism can only be stopped by
means of joint political decisions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The British official said he was impressed by Putin's resolve
to develop economic relations with Britain and improve the
economic performance in Russia itself.
</P>
<P>
The resolve will alleviate concerns that have delayed
investments in Russia, Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov, the Russian foreign minister, confirmed at a Wednesday
briefing that Russia is prepared to move towards the resumption of
relations with NATO on the basis of the Russia-NATO Founding Act
and in the framework of international law.
</P>
<P>
Moscow froze its ties with NATO when the military alliance
started a 78-day bombing campaign against Yugoslavia last March.
Relations thawed with the visit to Moscow earlier this month by
NATO Secretary General George Robertson.
</P>
<P>
Cook, who arrived here Tuesday on a two-day working visit,
also extended an invitation from British Prime Minister Tony Blair
for Putin to visit Britain following Russia's March presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
Putin is the runaway favorite in the polls and many have
predicted that he would win the elections scheduled for March 26.

MOSCOW, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Former Russian President Boris
Yeltsin on Wednesday praised Acting President Vladimir Putin and
urged Russians to vote for him in the upcoming presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
"Putin is on the right road and follows it firmly," Yeltsin
told reporters during a visit to the residence of Patriarch Alexy

</P>
<P>
Yeltsin stepped down abruptly on December 31, six months
before the expiration of his term of office in the Kremlin, and
named Putin, the prime minister, to serve concurrently as acting
head of state.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin praised the acting president as "a man of inner
strength, with firmness and resolution and at the same time
sensitive to everything human."
</P>
<P>
Putin is seen as the top favorite among the 11 candidates
vying for the Kremlin in the March 26 balloting.

<HEADLINE> Canada Faces Best International Economic Environment: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Canada is facing the best
international economic environment it has not seen for many years,
the Conference Board of Canada forecast Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In its Winter 2000 World Outlook, the influential economic
monitor said that "it may be the best of all world," with the
Asian crisis becoming an event of history.
</P>
<P>
Virtually every country in that part of the world is
experiencing "significant real growth," concluded the report.
</P>
<P>
In Europe, economic growth is accelerating as countries are
shrugging off the slowdown coupled with last year's introduction
of the regional currency euro, added the report.
</P>
<P>
The board looks at Canada's "massive expansion in the United
States" as the most important economic development for the country,
expecting the growth cycle to hit the longest in record.
</P>
<P>
World economic developments will help generate further
employment growth in Canada to improve domestic purchasing power,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The board, however, holds a less optimistic view on the
inflation trend, saying "these stellar results have not markedly
worsened the outlook for inflation either in the United States or
Canada."

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Sub-Committee Expresses Support for White Paper on Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Over 40 members of the
Subcommittee for Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan Compatriots and
Overseas Chinese of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) National Committee today expressed their strong
support of the government's white paper on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
At a gathering here today, the members agreed that the white
paper has reaffirmed to the world that the One-China policy is the
foundation and prerequisite for national reunification.
</P>
<P>
The white paper "The One-China Principle and the Taiwan Issue"
was issued by the Taiwan Affairs Office and the Information Office
of the State Council on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the gathering, Wan Guoquan, vice-chairman of the
CPPCC National Committee, said peaceful reunification can only be
realized by adhering to the One-China Principle, and any attempt
to separate the motherland is doomed to fail.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Dianming, vice president of the Taiwan Studies Society
and one of the subcommittee member, said the One-China Principle
cannot be challenged because it safeguards China's sovereignty and
territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
"The One-China Principle is the basis for maintaining peace on
both sides of the Taiwan Straits," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Shi Sihao, another member, said the One-China Principle is in
line with the wishes of Taiwan compatriots who seek peace,
development, and stability, and is to the benefit of all the
people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Peikang said the success of "One Country, Two Systems" in
Hong Kong and Macao has set a good example for Taiwan and the
white paper on Taiwan "not only shows the government's resolve to
safeguard national reunification but also its sincerity in solving
the Taiwan issue in a peaceful way, " he added.

<HEADLINE> One Million Beijingers Seek Mates Through Matrimonial Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- As many as one million
Beijingers seeking spouses have registered at matrimonial agencies,
according to today's Beijing Evening News.
</P>
<P>
The capital city of China now has more than 500 such agencies,
the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
Although the Internet, cell phones, and modern transportation
have made quick and convenient communication possible, many people
complain that their social life is actually very limited because
of the pressures of work and their busy daily schedule.
</P>
<P>
"Matrimonial agencies can give people more opportunities and
save time," one young man was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper report, matrimonial agencies have
become one of the major ways people of all ages attempt to find
marriage partners in Beijing, a city of 14 million people.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese used to rely on matchmakers and their parents'
choices to arrange marriages, but after the founding of the People
's Republic in 1949, they began to have more freedom to make
marriage decisions for themselves.

<HEADLINE> Cultural Relics Well Preserved in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- China's top heritage watchdog
organization today said that the country made new achievements in
preserving cultural relics in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wenbin, chief of the State Administration of Cultural
Heritage (SACH), said that many localities paid great attention to
relic protection and did wonderful jobs.
</P>
<P>
Construction workers now have completed the strengthening and
redecoration of the Museum of the Chinese Revolution and the
Museum of the Chinese History, as well as the dredging of the
moat surrounding the Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
A great number of relics unearthed in Ali Prefecture in the
Tibet Autonomous Region have been preserved in good condition by
local administrators.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists continued their work at Yanshi, capital of the
Shang Dynasty (16th-11th Century B.C.), and at Chang'an, capital
of the Western Han Dynasty (B.C.206-A.D. 24).
</P>
<P>
At the national relics protection conference, which began today,
Zhang also remarked on the successful cultural exchanges between
the mainland and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the
Macao Special Administrative Region, and Taiwan, where SACH
presented several relics exhibitions. Also in 1999, the Hong Kong-
based China Heritage Fund (CHF) invested four million U.S. dollars
in the reconstruction of the Jianfu Palace Garden in the Forbidden
City.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China signed the international covenant on relics
preservation during wartime, and now China is party to all four
international heritage protection covenants.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Chinese government sponsored exhibitions
of unique Chinese relics in the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
While achieving most of the goals set by SACH at the beginning
of the year, China still has work to do in heritage protection,
Zhang said. He urged localities to effectively preserve and
protect their cultural relics and heritage.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that China has about 400,000 cultural
relics sites, with 750 of them considered the most treasured in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen sites, including the Great Wall and the Forbidden City,
are now on the World Heritage list, and some 1,900 museums across
the country now contain nearly 12 million cultural treasures.

<HEADLINE> Israel Warns of Rising Terror Attacks as Peace Stalls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Public Security
Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami warned Wednesday that there has been a
surging round of terrorist activities against Israelis as a result
of the recent deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
To curb the renewed wave of terror attacks, Israel has to move
ahead the peace talks with the Palestinians while stepping up
alerts, the moderate minister told Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The minister issued the warning one day after Israel's General
Security Service announced Tuesday that Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority arrested dozens of activists of the militant
Hamas organization over the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The arrests were made after Israel discovered late January an
underground Hamas cell responsible for a series of bombing attacks
in Israel the last several months, including one in the northern
coastal city of Netanya in November and one in the nearby city of
Hadera in January. Nearly 50 people were wounded in these two
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israel said the cell had also planned to blow up a large
residential building in Jerusalem and passenger buses.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a Palestinian youth was arrested
Wednesday after he stabbed a religious Jew, slightly injuring his
shoulder, in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israeli intelligence agencies have warned recently that if no
progress was made in the peace talks with the Palestinians, Israel
might face another Intifada, the popular uprising the Palestinians
staged between 1987-1993 during which the two sides clashed
violently on the streets.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations ground to a halt
early this month following a dispute over an overdue Israeli troop
withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross is in the region in a
fresh bid to narrow the gaps between the two sides and help resume
the stalled talks. But there was no sign of a breakthrough.

DHAKA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The visiting Cuban Special Envoy
Alberto Velazco San Jose called on Bangladeshi Foreign Minister
Abdus Samad Azad here Wednesday and discussed with him the first
South summit to be held in Havana, the Cuban capital.

During the half-hour meeting, both sides were of the opinion
that the Havana summit would come up with a solution for the
developing countries to deal with problems arising from
globalization and trade liberalization.

recommended holding the first South summit in Havana.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Increase Fish Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's fish output in
value terms is projected to be worth 9.37 billion ringgit (2.465
billion U.S. dollars) by the next decade, almost double that of
the total output in 1998, Deputy Agriculture Minister Mohamed
Shariff Omar said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The projection is based on fish catch reaching 1.93 million
tons by 2010 from 1.308 million tons two years ago, the deputy
minister told the parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia is also projected to produce 600,000 tons of
other aquacultural products worth 4.03 billion ringgit (1.06
billion dollars) during the period.
</P>
<P>
He said the authorities would ensure that fish caught in
Malaysian waters are landed at local fishing ports by adopting
measures such as suspending and not renewing the operating
licenses of errant trawlers and the permits for their equipment
and requiring the installation of the vessel tracking management
system.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka: UNCTAD Declarations Reflect LDCs Demands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh said Wednesday that
the declarations of the just-ended meeting of the U.N. Conference
on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in Bangkok reflected the nine-
point demand raised by Bangladesh in regard to international trade
as the spokesman of least-developed countries (LDCs).
</P>
<P>
"Bangladesh as the spokesman of LDCs has strongly presented
their demands and said if the UNCTAD acts just like a debating
society, such conferences will yield no result," Bangladesh
Commerce Minister Abdul Jalil told at a press conference on his
return here from the Bangkok meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said that besides the LDCs, several developed nations
including Britain, the Netherlands and Sweden, responded
positively to Bangladesh's proposals, which recommended that the
World Trade Organization take measures for poverty alleviation,
easy access of LDC products to the world market, increased foreign
direct investment in developing nations and debt relief.
</P>
<P>
Jalil stressed that only "assurances" from the developed world
would not bring any fruit to the developing countries. The LDCs
now feel that it is necessary for them to get united to protect
their interests in face of globalization, he added.

<P>
NEW DELHI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Indian rupee recovered
its overnight losses at the close of the interbank foreign
exchange markets in Bombay Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Opening at around 43.6000/6050 rupees per U.S. dollar, the
rupee later traded at a range of 43.5975 and 43.6100 to the dollar
before closing at 43.6000/6050, moderately up from the overnight
close of 43.6150/6200 rupees.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the recovery was due to the absence of adequate
demand for dollars from corporations and importers amidst
persistent dollar inflows from foreign institutional investors
exceeding demand.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of India maintained the reference
rate at 43.61 rupees per dollar.

HARARE, February 23 (Xinhua) -- An EgyptAir Boeing 767 aircraft
carrying 94 passengers crash-landed on Tuesday evening at the
Harare International Airport when one of the engines on the left
wing fell out, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe said no one was
injured and all the people on board flight MS880 were evacuated
safely.
</P>
<P>
The damaged portion of the runway has been closed for
investigation and repairs.
</P>
<P>
Eye witnesses said the incident occurred around 10:00 p.m. on
Tuesday soon after a British Airways plane had taken off.
</P>
<P>
They said they saw a blaze of fire when the engine fell on the
runway, but airport rescue services kept the flames from
spreading and evacuated the passengers and crew.
</P>
<P>
The engine and other components were strewn on part of the 023
runway tamarc which sources close to the investigation teams said
had no International Landing System (ILS). The system is used to
guide the landing.

The source said the Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe always
advised pilots to use the 05 runway tamarc which had the latest
ILS systems.

<HEADLINE> Italian Inflation in January Hit 3-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Inflation in Italy rose from 2.1
percent in December to 2.2 percent in January, the highest in
almost three years, the Italian national statistics institute
Istat said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Istat said the general price index showed a monthly rise of 0.2
percent and the average inflation rate over the last 12 months was
1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous months, the latest rise was not mostly due to
petrol and oil price rises, Istat added.
</P>
<P>
The biggest riser was hotels and catering, which showed a 0.6
percent monthly gain, largely because of increases in hotel prices,
Istat said.
</P>
<P>
Transport, which includes motor fuel prices, fell by 0.1
percent in January.
</P>
<P>
Other higher-than-average risers were accommodation, water,
electricity and fuel, which showed a 0.4 percent gain because of
rent and heating increases, and food and drink, which went up 0.3
percent because of dearer fish and vegetables, especially potatoes.
</P>
<P>
The communications continued to fall, by 0.1 percent, thanks to
another fall in the prices of on-line services.

<HEADLINE> China Achieves Remarkable Progress in Housing Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Housing provided by work units
has been terminated in China, and most provinces and autonomous
regions have established programs by which individuals and
families are responsible for renting or buying their own
residences, said Minister of Construction Yu Zhengsheng here today.
</P>
<P>
Yu told a press conference on housing reform that reform of the
housing provision system has played an important role in promoting
residential home buying, and ordinary residents have increasingly
become the major players in the housing market.
</P>
<P>
Yu noted that over 70 percent of the commercial houses sold in
cities and towns across the country were bought by individuals.
</P>
<P>
In most provinces and cities, around 60 percent of all public
houses have been sold to individuals, and the proportion surpassed
80 percent in Chongqing Municipality, and the provinces of
Zhejiang and Henan.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China has further improved the housing fund system
and accelerated the development of housing loans to individuals.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the number of employees participating
in the housing fund system had reached 69 million, and some 140.9
billion yuan had been collected for the fund, representing an
increase of 39.8 billion yuan over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
According to Yu, various commercial banks have also expanded
loans to individuals. From January to December 1999, the
Industrial and Commercial Bank, the Agricultural Bank, the Bank of
China, and the Construction Bank, granted 74.6 billion yuan in
housing loans to individuals, with the loan balance topping 126
billion yuan, an increase of 76.9 billion yuan compared with 1998.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the housing reform also has boosted the
development of housing construction. Statistics show that the
completed floor space of commercial houses in 1999 totaled 162
million square meters, an increase of 29.8 percent over the
previous year, and total floor space of 91.63 million square
meters of economy housing was also completed last year, an
increase of 66 percent over 1998.

BAGHDAD, February 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 11,200 Iraqi children
and elderly people died of different diseases in January as a
result of the continuation of the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq,
Iraqi health ministry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the ministry showed that 8,182 children
under the age of five died of diarrhea, pneumonia and respiratory
infections and malnutrition in January, compared with 389 deaths in
January 1989.
</P>
<P>
The figures indicated that 3,054 elderly people died of
diabetes, hypertension, heart diseases and cancer in January, while
only 377 cases were registered in January 1989.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under harsh U.N. economic sanctions since 1990
following its invasion of Kuwait, which touched off the 1991 Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
The statistics showed that some 1.27 million children and
elderly people have died of different diseases since the imposition
of the embargo, which led to a long-time severe shortage of
medicines in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians Crackdown on Hamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) have arrested dozens of Palestinians in a
crackdown on terrorism over the past weeks, the Ha'aretz daily
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a
statement that the arrested were members of the Islamic militant
group Hamas, which is opposed to the peace process between Israel
and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Some of the arrested confessed in the interrogation that they
were planning to launch a bomb attack on a high-rise residential
building in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
It, if successful, would kill and wound many civilians, leading
to a tragic scene like the twin-bombing of U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania in 1998 and the detonation of apartment buildings in
Russia last year.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the extremists also claimed responsibility
for a series of recent terrorist attacks in Israel's northern
coastal city of Netanya and Hadera, which injured at least 46
civilians.
</P>
<P>
Israel's General Security Service (GSS) lifted a gag order on
the arrests late Tuesday night, which were conducted jointly by the
GSS, the IDF, Israel Police and PLA Preventive Security agents.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough in the investigation was made on January 30,
when an Arab student was arrested in a Netanya market when he was
buying a Kippa (Jewish skullcap).
</P>
<P>
In the past, Hamas members had used skullcaps to disguise
themselves as Israeli Jews and thus lowering Israeli police's
vigilance.
</P>
<P>
The student, from a university in Nablus, at first claimed that
he was a theology student and needed a Kippa to make a "comparative
research."
</P>
<P>
After the story proved false, he confessed that he was in fact
affiliated with the Hamas military wing and led the police to
arrest his colleagues, many of whom were Palestinian students in
Nablus, Hebron and Kalkilya.
</P>
<P>
In the following days, Israel police arrested nearly 60 suspects
in Area B, which is under its security control, and Palestinian
police carried out their tasks in Area A, which is under full
Palestinian rule.
</P>
<P>
The ensuing probe found out that they were responsible for the
following incidents: the bomb attack on August 15, 1999, at the
entrance to an Netanya office building, which did not render
casualties; the planting of an explosive device on August 16, 1999
outside the Israeli-Palestinian Coordination Office in Ramallah,

<HEADLINE> Manila Said to Be Ready for Mayon Volcano Eruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Wednesday that it is closely monitoring the situation of Mayon
Volcano and is ready to assist the local government for possible
victims of the impending eruption.
</P>
<P>
Vice President and Social Welfare Secretary Gloria Macapagal-
Arroyo said the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD)
is closely monitoring the readiness and status of the local
government units' level of stocks.
</P>
<P>
Arroyo noted in a statement that the DSWD has pre-positioned
food items and is ready to augment the local government units'
relief supplies.
</P>
<P>
As of Wednesday, more than 6,000 persons living around Mayon
have been evacuated to various evacuation centers set up by the
government.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said
Wednesday morning that several significant changes in the activity
of the volcano had been noted in the last 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
The institute said sectoral collapse at the southern side of
the growing lava dome continued and materials are continuously
being detached from the lava dome, comprising either lava
fragments or rocks that produce rock-falls.
</P>
<P>
The lava fragments rolled down to a distance of about one
kilometer from the summit and produced some observable ash and gas,
said the institute.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the institute also observed increasing seismic
activity and sulfur dioxide emission, which indicate the
continuing supply of magma to very shallow levels beneath the
summit and into the dome.
</P>
<P>
In view of the relatively high unrest at Mayon Volcano, the
institute reiterated Alert Level 3, meaning that a hazardous
eruption is possible within weeks.
</P>
<P>
Mayon Volcano, 300 kilometers southeast of the Philippine
capital of Manila, is considered as the most active volcano in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Government Urged to Change Equivocal Attitude on Sharia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's legislators have urged
the federal government to change its blurry stand upon the actual
or proposed implementation of the Islamic Sharia law in some
states.
</P>
<P>
Some House representatives of the country's National Assembly
insisted that the government should, without further delay, make a
categorical statement on the adoption of Sharia as state laws, the
News Agency of Nigeria reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
If nothing was done, the crisis in Kaduna might spill over to
other states of the country, said House representative Florence
Aya in the Nigerian capital Abuja on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
She expressed her doubt upon the rationales of why Sharia
should be imposed as a state law, when the religious code had
actually been executed all the time in Moslem communities.
</P>
<P>
She said that Kaduna is too sensitive a place to implement
Sharia, for the population of the state is almost evenly divided
between Moslem and Christian residents.
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is that the federal government ought to do
 something about Sharia. Other states have been watching Kaduna
State," she added.
</P>
<P>
An all day restriction on movement had replaced on Tuesday the
previous dusk-to-down curfew in the northern state capital Kaduna,
as the federal and state authorities tried hard to curb the raging
violence in the city.
</P>
<P>
At least 50 people have been killed since Moslems and
Christians clashed on Monday over the proposed implementation of
Sharia law in Kaduna State, the Guardian newspaper said Wednesday.

TOKYO, February 23 (Xinhua) -- American national champions
Naomi Lang and Peter Tchernyshev established their leading role
after the compulsory at the Four Continents Figure Skating
Championships in Osaka on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Americans collected the best in two compulsory performances
of the Viennese Waltz and Quickstep, ahead of the Canadian duo of
Marie-France Dubreuil and Patrice Lauzon and their compatriot
world junior champions Jamie Silverstein and Justin Pekarek.
</P>
<P>
"Coming in from last year being third, we are very excited.
Maybe we can get higher this year. We skated very well in both
dances," said 21-year-old Lang.
</P>
<P>
Dubreuil and Lauzon are the Canadian national champions, but
the pair had an early setback as Lauzon suffered a stomach flu and
could not practice in the morning.
</P>
<P>
The championships were inaugurated a year ago in Canada under
the auspices of the International Skating Union, and aim to
challenge the star-studded European championships.

<HEADLINE> ITTF to Introduce Larger Ball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The International Table
Tennis Federation (ITTF) decided at its generel meeting here
Wednesday to increase the diameter of the table tennis ball from
38 milimetre to 40mm beginning October 1.
</P>
<P>
The use of the larger ball will come into force after Sydney
2000 Olympic Games in September, the meeting sources said.
</P>
<P>
The benefits of using larger ball are that the table tennis
ball will be more visible for spectators and television viewers.
</P>
<P>
The larger ball will reduce the spin of the ball and speed of
the game. It will also make it easier to learn to play table
tennis.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also decided that the ITTF headquarters will be
moved from Hastings in England to Lausanne in Switzerland, where
the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
A discussion was held about splitting the world championships
into a team and an individual event.
</P>
<P>
The majority was in favour of such a move but the final
decision will only be made Thursday when the ITTF Council meets.

KUALA LUMPUR, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Eight more container
haulage companies will be set up in Malaysia to help ease port
congestion, Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet has given the approval following a proposal by the

container transport more effective, he told reporters after the
ministry's post-Cabinet meeting here.
</P>

Seven other companies, previously only allowed one-way cargo
haulage to ports, have also been approved to do so both ways now,
bringing to 20 the number of container haulage companies operating
nation-wide, Ling said.
</P>
<P>
With more haulage companies in operation, container congestion
at ports, especially during festive seasons, would "become a thing
of the past," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hoping that with the issuance of the new licenses, there will
be increased capacity for container haulage, the minister said the
increased capacity for container haulage should also benefit small-

<P>
DHAKA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A two-day workshop began here
Wednesday with a plan to further disseminate an effective
production technology on jute and allied fiber to growers.
</P>
<P>
Jointly organized by the Bangladesh Jute Research Institute (
BJRI) and Dhaka-based International Jute Organization (IJO), the
workshop-cum-training is participated by 80 agricultural
scientists and extension personnel from the BJRI and other
research organizations.
</P>
<P>
Executive Director of IJO Henri Jason said despite the high
socio-economic importance of jute and allied fiber crops in the
growing countries, the production is confronted with multiple
problems, including the low and unstable price.
</P>
<P>
Besides, unavailability of improved seeds, poor adoption of
modern production technologies and poor funding resources at the
farmers' level are major hindrances to improved cultivation of the
jute and allied fiber, he said.
</P>
<P>
The IJO chief mentioned a number of projects implemented by his
organization to improve the current situation and a host of
production technologies developed by the IJO.
</P>
<P>
He also focused on the importance of collaboration among jute
and allied fiber growing countries to develop an organized
infrastructure for production, processing, storage and marketing
of the fiber and the handicrafts made out of it.

<HEADLINE> Plastic Composites Found in Oil Palm Bunches in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Two lecturers from
Science University of Malaysia have achieved a breakthrough in
producing plastic composites from oil palm bunches suitable for
the automotive and furniture industries.
</P>
<P>
The discovery was made by Associate Professors Zainal Arifin
Mohamed Ishak and Rozman Din from the university's School of
Industrial Technology after about four years' research.
</P>
<P>
The two lectures Wednesday announced their discovery at a news
conference in Pulau Pinang, northern Malaysia, according to
Bernama news agency.
</P>
<P>
A multi-component additive has been specially formulated to
enhance the capability and broaden the scope of the composites'
applications, Rozman said.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the incorporation of thermoplastic such as
polypropylene and polyethylene as the main matrices, the
composites have thermo-formable properties.
</P>
<P>
The composites thus could be extruded and molded into different
shapes and sizes using extrusion and injection molding techniques,
he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Zainal, the product, which could be produced at a
lower cost as it was less abrasive and had low density, had
commercial potential in automotive, furniture, packaging, paneling,
building and recreational components.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia produces more than 8 million tons of oil palm bunches
and more than 13 million tons of fronds a year, which are either
burned off or left for mulching on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Zainal said an oil palm fiber processing factory in Teluk Intan
in the northern state of Perak had adopted the technology to
produce the composites.

LUANDA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program (WFP) has provided at least 250,000 displaced Angolans in
the central Malanje Province with some 18,175 tons of diverse
foodstuffs since last September.
</P>
<P>
According to Hans Vikoler, WFP representative to the province,
the U.N. agency would reconstruct some schools, dig wells and
resume both children nutritional centers and the "food for work"
program.
</P>

The program were suspended last year due to the renewed civil
war between the government troops and the National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) rebels.
</P>
<P>
Other programs launched by the WFP include the project of
resettling war displaced people back to their homes where they are
expected to develop farming activities.
</P>
<P>
Malanje has been one of the provinces that suffered most from
the over- 25-year civil war.
</P>

well as representatives from the Organization of African Unity
(OAU), is a follow- up to the U.N. meeting last month on the same
topic.
</P>
<P>
The summit is aimed at studying the causes for the sluggish
implementation of the 1999 Lusaka peace agreement and mapping out
ways to push for its implementation.
</P>
<P>
Since the cease-fire agreement was penned by all belligerents
in July and August last year, there have been reports of continued
fighting on both sides in the vast central African country,
casting doubt on the hopes it raised for resolving the conflict.
</P>
<P>
There has been a loud outcry for the deployment of
international peace- keepers to help restore peace and order in
the DRC, but the U.N. fell short of reaching consensus on that
issue.

<HEADLINE> Teams to Next Table Tennis Worlds to Pay in Advance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The International Table
Tennis Federation (ITTF) Wednesday decided at its council meeting
here that teams for next year's world team table tennis
championships must pay the accommodation and food costs in advance
before their entries can be accepted.
</P>
<P>
This was to prevent eleventh hour withdrawals and was only fair
to the hosts who might have to incur extra expenses in the event
of last-minute pullouts, ITTF President Adham Sharara said after
the ITTF council meeting which was held in conjunction with the on-
going 45th world championships here.
</P>
<P>
"So the council has decided on a few preconditions before we
accept entries," she said.
</P>
<P>
Sharara said teams for future world championships would be
required to give the host country letters showing they have the
financial means to participate and have obtained their governments
' consent.
</P>
<P>
The council also decided that countries who withdrew from the
ongoing meet would have to reimburse the organizers for the costs
incurred, she said.
</P>
<P>
"These countries will have to pay up before their entries for
the next championships in Osaka can be accepted," Sharara said.
</P>
<P>
A record 21 countries and regions withdrew at the last minute
from the ongoing World Team Table Tennis Championships, resulting
in a spate of walkovers.

<HEADLINE> Exhibition Reveals Japanese Troops' Atrocities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TENGCHONG(YUNNAN), February 23 (Xinhua) -- A photo exhibition
in Tengchong, in southwest China's Yunnan Province, reveals the
atrocities committed by Japanese soldiers in May 1942.
</P>
<P>
During the 28-month occupation of Tengchong, Japanese troops
killed 28,000 local residents.
</P>
<P>
A great number of pictures show corpses of women and men killed
by Japanese soldiers and numerous weapons used in massacres.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers bayoneted 101 farmers to death at Chaziyuan and
Wanyao villages and shot at 100 custom officers during evacuations
from Liba Ferry at Nujiang. There were other unspeakable acts of
cruelty as well.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is held in a cemetery for revolutionary martyrs.
The cemetery houses the ashes of 3,346 martyrs who died defending
Tengchong against the Japanese aggressors.
</P>
<P>
A cemetery keeper said, "The invasion of Japan into China is a
historical fact. The attempt by right wing groups in Japan to deny
these atrocities has aroused great indignation among the Chinese
people."

<HEADLINE> Siberian Tiger In Critical Condition From Rotten Meat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A Siberian tiger named Duoduo
died after eating rotten frozen meat several days ago, and another,
Meimei, is still in coma after more than ten days of treatment.
</P>
<P>
The two tigers, both female, were taken to the zoo in Shenyang
in northeast China's Liaoning Province from Harbin in the nearby
province of Heilongjiang, where two veterinarians determined that
the tigers fell ill from eating the rotten meat.
</P>
<P>
The two tigers, both in their twenties, old age for Siberian
tigers, were vulnerable to diseases, and the cold conditions in
their cages worsened their conditions.
</P>
<P>
Zookeepers said that they had bought 800 kilograms of meat for
the animals before the Chinese Lunar New Year on February 5, and
the long storage period caused the meat to rot and the tigers
developed diarrhea and vomiting on February 10.
</P>
<P>
Many local people called and visited the tigers during this
period, trying to help them get through the critical period.
</P>
<P>
Siberian tigers are among the top-ten most endangered species
in the world, with only around 300 remaining in the wild. The
Shenyang zoo has bred and raised 13 Siberian tigers, and the first
tiger cesarean birth at the zoo gained great attention nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Jewelry Industry Expected to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Improving economic
fundamentals in the region and continued economic expansion in the
United States and European Union will fuel the growth of jewelry
business this year, Leung Sik-wah, chairman of the Jewelry
Advisory Committee of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council,
said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the press conference of the Hong Kong International
Jewelry Show 2000, Leung said: "The sluggish performance of the
industry in 1997 and 1998 was mainly due to the sharp decline in
exports to Japan and other Asian countries."
</P>
<P>
However, in 1999, Hong Kong's total jewelry exports rebounded
by 25 percent over 1998, to 13.3 billion HK dollars (about 1.7
billion U.S. dollars). Exports to the United States, the biggest
market, increased by 34 percent, and that to both European Union
and Japan, by 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
To capitalize on the millennium's jewelry sales opportunity, a
total of 872 international jewelry manufactures and traders will
converge in Hong Kong early next month, featuring an extensive
array of precious jewelry, pearls and metals.
</P>
<P>
The jewelry show, to be held on March 6-9 in Hong Kong, has
recorded a 10 percent increase in the number of exhibitors over
last year and will be the ever largest of its kind in the region,
according to the organizers.

<HEADLINE> Fast Food Industry Registers Rapid Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) --The State Administration of
Internal Trade said today that China's fast food industry reported
a huge growth of more than 20 percent last year, with annual sales
of 75 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The sector has kept a double-digit growth for two consecutive
years since 1998. Sale revenue accounts for over one-third of
China's fast-growing food and beverage industry.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, some newly-emerged marketing patterns such as
take aways, franchise and food courts have significantly enriched
the fast food sector and provided considerable working
opportunities for lay-offs and job hunters. However, experts in
the industry pointed out that the development of Chinese fast food
lags behind western fast food in terms of variety, scale and
modern equipment.
</P>
<P>
China will host an international fast food equipment
exhibition in Beijing on April 18 this year to attract foreign
investment and update equipment. A symposium on fast food in the
21st-century will also be held during the Expo.

the demands of the market. He also urged farmers to lower
production costs and give priority to product quality to increase
their income.

JAKARTA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
Wednesday pledged that it will adopt a policy to reduce its
dependence on foreign debt gradually and to be more transparent in
its disbursement.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Bambang Sudibyo told a hearing with the House

</P>
<P>
The Japanese government, he said, has pledged to reschedule 1.6

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Leaves for Lusaka Summit on Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni left for the Zambian capital Lusaka on Wednesday morning
to attend a one-day summit on the issue of the Democratic Republic
of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka summit, to be attended by heads of state from the
DRC, Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Rwanda, Uganda and Mozambique as
well as representatives from the Organization of African Unity
(OAU), is a follow- up to the U.N. meeting last month on the same
topic.
</P>
<P>
The summit is aimed at studying the causes for the sluggish
implementation of the 1999 Lusaka peace agreement and mapping out
ways to push for its implementation.
</P>
<P>
Since the cease-fire agreement was penned by all belligerents
in July and August last year, there have been reports of continued
fighting on both sides in the vast central African country,
casting doubt on the hopes it raised for resolving the conflict.
</P>
<P>
There has been a loud outcry for the deployment of
international peace- keepers to help restore peace and order in
the DRC, but the U.N. fell short of reaching consensus on that
issue.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, S. Africa to Join Hands in Fight Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The police authorities of
Nigeria and South Africa have resolved to combine their forces to
fight against crimes in both countries in an effort to protect and
strengthen the bilateral relationship between the two nations, a
Nigerian newspaper said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Minister of Police Affairs, David Jemibewon, was on a
visit to South Africa to devise ways of combating the wave of
crimes and identify areas of cooperation between the two
countries, the Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian police have a lot to learn from their South
African counterparts, the minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Jemibewon said South Africa has more advanced technology in the
areas of production and manufacturing of logistic equipment for
crime control, which Nigeria needs for more effective policing
across the country.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria would support South Africa directly in the spirit of
looking inward within the continent for the procurement of police
equipment, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Nigeria is in the process of revamping and
modernizing its police force after the establishment of democratic
government last May, just like South Africa's abolition of
apartheid in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South African National Police Commissioner, Steve
Tshwete, said both countries have agreed to rely on each other's
experience and expertise in crime combat, as an initiative towards
ridding the continent of cross-border crimes.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll in Nigerian Riot Rises to 50: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The violence starting Monday in
Nigeria's northern city of Kaduna over the proposed implementation
of the Islamic Sharia law, had claimed lives of about 50 people,
the Guardian newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
An all day restriction on movement Tuesday replaced the
previous dusk-to- down curfew as the federal and state authorities
tried hard to curb the raging violence in the city, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Shekari, Deputy Governor of the Kaduna State, said
late Tuesday that it was apparent "the senseless destruction of
lives and property would not ordinarily abate. Hence, more
drastic measures to restore order were being adopted."
</P>
<P>
Shekari has directed the closure of all offices and businesses
forthwith from Tuesday noon.
</P>
<P>
At Malali village in the suburb of the Kaduna city, at least
six victim' s bodies were taken for burial by residents Tuesday,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The villagers were killed during the day when fighting to repel
an attack by youths from another village.
</P>
<P>
Some city residents had rushed into the campus of Nigerian
Defense Academy, the 44th Army Barracks or the nearby police
stations to seek refuge.
</P>
<P>
"The government would do whatever is considered necessary to
restore law and order to Kaduna," said President Olusegun Obasanjo
in the capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
He expressed "distress and anguish" at the "avoidable
violence", and sent in the federal troops to help quell the
spreading violence following Monday's protests against the Sharia
law.
</P>
<P>
The Kaduna state government said in a broadcast message Monday
that it had yet to decide on the introduction of Sharia in the
state whose population is almost equally split between Christians
and Moslems.
</P>
<P>
In desperate efforts to get the situation under control, police
were reportedly forced to fire at some Moslem and Christian gangs,
leaving corpses on the streets Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Several buildings in the town, including churches, mosques, and
a big market were set on fire by the confronting gangs.
</P>
<P>
The Sharia issue has become increasingly explosive in the most
populous African country since the northern state of Zamfara
dominated by Moslems applied the Islamic law last month.
</P>
<P>
Several other states have also announced their intention to
introduce Sharia, provoking protests in the west African country
where Christians are dominant.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Japan's merchandise trade
surplus plummeted 30.7 percent in January from a year earlier to
522.6 billion yen (5.0 billion dollars) for the 10th consecutive
month of decline, the Finance Ministry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Rising crude oil prices and a strong yen were behind the rapid
fall in the trade surplus, economists said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's imports grew 10.7 percent in January from a year
earlier to 2,986.1 billion yen (28.8 billion dollars) while
exports grew only 1.7 percent to 3,508.7 billion yen (33.8 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus was the smallest since January 1998, when it
totaled 406.5 billion yen (3.9 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Japan's politically sensitive trade surplus with the United
States dropped 1.9 percent to 477.8 billion yen (4.6 billion
dollars) for the second straight month of decline.
</P>
<P>
As for other Asian countries, Japan's merchandise trade surplus
posted the first drop in two months, decreasing 20.8 percent,
while that with the 15-member European Union (EU) fell 20.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
Japan's merchandise trade balance is measured on the basis of
goods clearing customs and is reported before adjustments for
seasonal factors.
</P>
<P>
In January, the yen averaged 103.75 to the dollar, up 10
percent from a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Emergency Landing in East China Caused by Engine Oil Leakage: Experts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
HANGZHOU, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Experts said today that the
emergency landing of a passenger plane in east China yesterday was
due to a leaking engine.
</P>
<P>
The leakage in the interior of the left engine turned the
engine off automatically. Following the leakage, the pungent smell
of oil entered the cabin from air conditioners.
</P>
<P>
The pilot, Kan Jianglu, recalled that the incident occurred
some ten minutes after take-off from Jianqiao Airport in Hangzhou,
capital of east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
At that time of the incident, the airplane was flying over
another city in the province, Shengzhou, at a altitude of 3,300
meters.
</P>
<P>
When the smell of oil became stronger and stronger in the
cabin area and the fuselage shook, flight attendants asked
passengers to stay calm. Kan said he informed commanders on the
ground about the incident requesting for permission to return.
</P>
<P>
Passengers were quite calm although the plane stayed in the
sky for more than 30 minutes after the accident. None of 43
passengers on board was injured.
</P>
<P>
The plane, bound for the city of Wenzhou in the province,
belongs to the Zhejiang Airlines.
</P>
<P>
The small plane is a Dash 8 manufactured by Pratt Whitney of
Canada. Last year, the airlines purchased three such planes and
they have kept an excellent safety record since going into
operation.
</P>
<P>
The Company has sent experts to the scene of the accident.
They are expected to arrive in Hangzhou in two or three days.
</P>
<P>
Passengers were re-routed to their destinations on a similar
plane about half an hour after the emergency landing.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Confidence Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The acceleration of China's
economy has greatly enhanced the hopes and confidence of Chinese
consumers, despite a slow recovery of consumer demands.
</P>
<P>
According to figures that the National Bureau of Statistics (
NBS) released today, 65 percent of Chinese consumers expect the
economy to exceed seven percent this year. Sixty percent believe
that the economy will grow faster than last year.
</P>
<P>
While becoming increasingly optimistic about the future of the
economy, there are concerns about the future of their own economic
livelihood.
</P>
<P>
In January, statistics show that only 39 percent of consumers
predicted an improvement in their economic situation in the next
12 months, three percentage points less than last December.
</P>
<P>
Thirty two percent thought that they were better off than one
year ago, four percentage points less than in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
According to NBS, employment comes first among the concerns of
consumers. Other major factors affecting consumer confidence
include possible increase on education, medical care, insurance
and housing.
</P>
<P>
NBS said that these uncertainties have discouraged consumers to
spend at present and therefore increase difficulties in improving
the consumer market. According to NBS, the government should
develop a sense of stability and security among consumers.
</P>
<P>
In January, the Consumer Expectation Index dropped by a
marginal 0.1 points from last December to 95.2 points.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Fund-Raiser Gets Ten Years in Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A court in Shunde City,
Guangdong Province, recently handed down a verdict sentencing
Zhang Changli to 10 years in prison for illegally raising public
funds.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, chairman and general manager of the Huali Industries Co.,
Ltd., was also ordered by the court to pay a fine of 200,000 yuan
(about 24,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to the court, between 1995 and 1997, Zhang carried
out his illegal activities with He Yingzhi, director of the
Beijiao Office of the Shunde Branch of the China Construction Bank
(CCB).
</P>
<P>
Many people were lured by Zhang and He to deposit a total 1.35
billion yuan in the CCB Beijiao Office to get higher interest
rates ranging from 18 to 36 percent. The money was then borrowed
by the Huali company from the bank office.
</P>
<P>
Zhang told investors he would build a so-called "Spark Science
and Technology Network" with the money. In fact, the illegal
activities caused enormous financial losses including some 410
million yuan Zhang invested in business operations across the
country.
</P>
<P>
So far, 690 million yuan of deposits are still unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
In September 1997, Zhang fled. In March 1998, Chinese public
security departments issued a warrant for the arrest of Zhang to
police authorities in New Zealand, Cuba, Tonga, Thailand and
Malaysia via Interpol.
</P>
<P>
In May 1999, Zhang was caught by Chinese police in a Southeast
Asian country and subsequently taken back to China.

<P>
JERUSALEM, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli defense establishment is holding up some 130 million
shekels (about 32 million U.S. dollars) in funding for bypass roads
and other security needs in the Jewish settlements, according to
Knesset (Parliament) Defense Budget Committee Chairman Avi
Yehezkel.
</P>
<P>
The funding has been held up because of diplomatic pressure
relating to the peace talks with the Palestinians, Yehezkel said.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry has reportedly confirmed that the IDF's
promised investment in security for settlements has been cut by
more than 100 million shekels (24.6 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli authorities are expected to make a request in the
next few days to those Islamic Movement activists occupying the
controversial Shihab al-Din burial site in Nazareth, asking for
their withdraw form the site.
</P>
<P>
Last October, a special ministerial committee decided to allow
the construction of a mosque on part of the disputed site, which
led Christian leaders shut churches, including the major shrines of
Christianity, throughout the country in protest against the
decision.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. special envoy Dennis Ross met with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat in Ramallah Tuesday night, following a day of violent
demonstrations by Palestinian youths on the outskirts of Ramallah
and Nablus to protest against the Israeli bombing of Lebanon and
the stalemate in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ross delivered to Arafat some new Israeli suggestions for
breaking the deadlock. Arafat said he wants the U.S. and European
Union to get more directly involved in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian final-status negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo also said
that the Palestinian National Authority expects the U.S. to play a
greater role, not just to be a messenger between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- An Israel Defense Forces sergeant, who made up a story of a
soldier being kidnapped by a Palestinian, broke down and confessed
that he had fabricated the whole thing after he was handed over to
the General Security Service.
</P>
<P>
The story once put the nation on edge and sent hundreds of
security personnel on a fruitless manhunt from Monday morning to
early Tuesday morning. The cost of the operation is estimated in
the hundreds of thousands of shekels.
</P>
<P>
The sergeant will be brought to military court Wednesday for an
extension of his arrest. He is expected to receive severe
punishment for his action, including prison time.

</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit warned the EU countries of
respecting Turkey's territorial integrity.

<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish police raided the Sincan province branch of the main

of having committed kidnappings, murders and blackmail.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):

<HEADLINE> Manila Aims to Boost Software Exports to 1 Bln U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is determined
of increasing its software exports from 300 million U.S. dollars
in 1999 to hefty 1 billion dollars in the next five years, a
ranking official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Science and Technology Secretary Filemon Uriarte said this will
be realized through the implementation of the 200-million-peso (5
million dollars) Virtual Center for Technology Innovation (VCTI)
in Information Technology (IT).
</P>
<P>
In launching the VCTI project, Uriarte said the information
technology, particularly software development, "has high added
value that caters to a large potential market requiring minimal
capital investment."
</P>
<P>
He said the project was also designed as electronic commerce
development in the Philippines is stunted because of the absence
of a payment backbone and a legal framework to tackle such legal
issues as intellectual property rights and consumer protection.
</P>
<P>
Also, most businesses and government agencies in the country
still need to be fully computerized, he added.
</P>
<P>
Uriarte said with the implementation of the VCTI, the
Philippines hopes to capture a substantial portion in the global
markets of IT products and services.
</P>
<P>
The program aims to produce at least 5,000 certified IT
professionals in the next five years to spearhead software into
one billion-dollar level and assist local businesses to remain
viable and competitive, Uriarte stressed.

<HEADLINE> Constitution Review Necessary: Indian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Indian President K. R.
Narayanan defended here on Wednesday the government decision to
have the country's Constitution reviewed, saying it had become
necessary to do so.
</P>
<P>
"While keeping the basic structure and salient features of the
Constitution inviolate, it has, however, become necessary to
examine the experience of the past 50 years to better achieve the
ideals enshrined in the Constitution," said the president in his
address to parliament on the opening day of the Budget Session.
</P>
<P>
This remark, however, was in sharp contrast to the president's
address on January 27, when he had expressed reservation over the
government's move and said that it should be examined whether the
Constitution had failed the people or the people had failed it.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Press Trust of India reported on Wednesday that
the Indian government had issued a notification on Tuesday night
to announce the formal establishment of a 11-member national
Constitution Review Commission.
</P>
<P>
Headed by former Chief Justice of India M. N. Venkatachalaiah,
the commission will review the working of the Constitution during
the past 50 years within the framework of the parliamentary system.
</P>
<P>
The commission will be based in New Delhi and have a one-year
term, said the PTI.

<HEADLINE> Indian President on Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- President K.R. Narayanan
said Wednesday India's foreign policy of non-alignment and
peaceful co-existence was relevant to the multi-polar world of
today.
</P>
<P>
He told Parliament that this was based on the principle of
protecting the country's vital interests and promoting national
ideals.
</P>
<P>
Narayanan said he looked forward to his state visit to China in
May this year and  India values its relations with China.
</P>
<P>
India will commemorate the 50th anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic relations between India and China, he
said. India established diplomatic relations with China on April 1,
1950.
</P>
<P>
Narayanan said that U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to
India next month will pave the way for a "broad-based and multi-
dimentional expansion of our bilateral relations."
</P>
<P>
He said that the government has continued to engage the U.S. in
a serious dialogue on security, non-proliferation and disarmament
issues predicated on India maintaining a credible minimum nuclear
deterrent.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that India looked forward to the consolidation of
its time-tested, comprehensive relations with Russia into a "
Strategic Partnership."
</P>
<P>
India awaits a visit to India by Russian president and the
signing of the Declaration on Strategic partnership between the
two countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Narayanan also observed that India valued its close and
friendly relations with the European Union, as well as other
countries of East Europe with whom India's ties of traditional
friendship had seen a "new dynamism" in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He said that relations with the United kingdom, Japan, Germany,
and France had shown a gratifying consolidation in recent times.
The strategic dialogue launched with Paris had produced "
encouraging results," he said, adding he looked forward to his
State visit to France in April.
</P>
<P>
Narayanan said that the government continues to pursue the
policy of continuously expanding and deepening its friendly, close,
wide-ranging, and constructive relations with neighboring
countries -- Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Maldives and
Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
New Delhi, he said, hoped that the Middle East peace process
would reach a satisfactory conclusion and "our relations with
Israel will continue to grow."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, "Pakistan has shown no inclination to end
its policy of aiding and abetting cross-border terrorism and its
hostile anti-India propaganda."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Islamabad would reverse its policy
of hostility towards India for restoration of normal ties between
the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Market Share of Foreign Cigarettes Up to 8.9 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The market share of imported
cigarettes rose to 8.9 percent in South Korea last month from 7.2
percent at the end of 1999, said the Finance and Economy Ministry
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The foreign cigarette share peaked at 12.5 percent in 1995, but
fell to 4.9 percent in 1998 after South Korea was gripped by a
financial crisis in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, it expanded to 6.1 percent last July and 7.2 percent
last December along with the economic recovery in the country.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said another factor contributed to more market
shares of foreign cigarettes was that foreign cigarette makers
such as British American Tobacco and Phillip Morris had introduced
lower-priced brands into the country ranging from 1,300 won (1.14
U.S. dollars) to 1,500 won per pack.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji on Nationwide Education Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FENGNAN (Hebei Province), February 23 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu
Rongji said recently that the current nationwide drive to put the
three emphases on education in theoretical study, political
awareness and good conduct ("three emphases") is to make
ideological, political and organizational preparations for China
to enter the new century and to fulfill the new historical tasks
ahead.
</P>
<P>
"Earnest efforts must be made to do the work well in accordance
with the plan of the Party Central Committee and the guidelines of
the important speeches of General Secretary Jiang Zemin," said Zhu,
who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the ruling Chinese Communist
Party.
</P>
<P>
While making an investigation of the education drive in Fengnan
county of north China's Hebei Province, some 150 kilometers east

three emphases" education drive at a local meeting attended by
over 700 local leading officials.

<P>
He said that "the outstanding problems" in the leading
officials must be overcome with regard to the Party's style of
work and the Party spirit. "A high standard and a strict
requirement should be set for the education," the Chinese leader
added.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the education drive, Zhu said, there should be a
marked improvement ideologically, politically, in their work style,
discipline and in their relations with the common people.

<P>
Zhu called on the local leadership to improve its guidance in
this regard so that a complete success will be achieved in the
drive.

<HEADLINE> India to Pursue Strategy to Counter Terrorism: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- President K. R. Narayanan
said here on Wednesday that India was ready to meet any challenge
to its territorial integrity and democracy and the government
would pursue its four-pronged strategy to counter what he called
Pakistan-backed terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan has shown no inclination to end its policy of aiding
and abetting cross-border terrorism and its hostile anti-India
propaganda," said Narayanan in his address to the Indian
parliament on the opening day of the budget session.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, terrorist violence has been most
pronounced in Jammu and Kashmir. There has also been an increase
in Pakistani firing across the border.
</P>
<P>
Elaborating on the four-pronged strategy to tackle terrorist
and separatist violence in Jammu and Kashmir, he said it would be
done by deepening the democratic process, accelerating economic
development, isolating foreign mercenaries and terrorists, and
playing a pro-active role to neutralize them.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed the hope that Islamabad would reverse
its policy of hostility toward India for restoration of normal
ties between the two countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Indian President K.R.
Narayanan said Wednesday that U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit
to India next month will pave the way for a "broad-based and multi-
dimentional expansion of our bilateral relations."
</P>
<P>
He told Parliament that the government has continued to engage
the U.S. in a serious dialogue on security, non-proliferation and
disarmament issues predicated on India maintaining a credible
minimum nuclear deterrent.
</P>
<P>
He said that a significant outcome was the decision to set up a
joint working group to deal with cross-border terrorism "which is
a menace to the whole world."
</P>
<P>
India, he stressed, reaffirms its commitment to global nuclear
disarmament in a time-bound manner on a comprehensive and non-
discriminatory basis.
</P>
<P>
"While addressing multilateral disarmament initiatives and
treaties, the government will continue to abide by the imperative
of preserving India's strategic autonomy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The President's address made no direct reference to the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) issue. The Indian government
has repeatedly said that a decision on signing the CTBT would be
taken only after achieving the widest-possible consensus and a
debate in Parliament.

<HEADLINE> Thai Food Becomes Increasing Popular in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Thai food is becoming
increasingly popular in the United States, the Thai News Agency (
TNA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Director-General of the Department of Export Promotion Banpot
Hong Thong was quoted as saying that Thai food was now ranked the
sixth most popular food in the U.S. market after that of Italy,
Mexico, Israel, China and France.
</P>
<P>
This had led to increasing exports of Thai food to the U.S.
market and also expanding Thai restaurants in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Thai restaurants are attracting more and more customers; thus
I believe that both exports of Thai food and Thai restaurants in
the U.S. will have a bright future," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Exporters of Thai food should, however, seek their partnership
networks in the U.S. market to coordinate with them and help them
promote and expand Thai food in supermarkets, he suggested, saying
this would also help boost image of Thai food as high quality and
hygienic products.

<HEADLINE> Mounting Fiscal Deficit Most Challenging Problem for India: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Growing fiscal deficit has
become one of the most challenging macro-economic management
problems faced by India, President K. R. Narayanan said here on
Wednesday in his opening address to the Parliament's budget
session.
</P>
<P>
Mounting fiscal deficit has led to deteriorating fiscal
position of both the central government and the states, which is a
situation that "needed to be urgently reversed," said the
president.
</P>
<P>
The deficit also reduces public investment, crowds out private
investment, raises interest rates and generates inflationary
pressure, said Narayanan.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, gross fiscal deficit of Indian
states has touched a record 750 billion rupees (17.44 billion U.S.
dollars), or 4.3 percent of India's gross domestic product (GDP),
while the burden of interest payments continued to be large at
above 4 percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
If India wants to sustain accelerated growth with high
employment coupled with modest inflation, he said, the growing
fiscal deficit needs to be contained.
</P>
<P>
"We have to adopt measures to curb the rising trend of non-plan
expenditure," elaborated the president. "These require difficult
decisions on expenditure control, downsizing of government and
austerity in spending," he said.
</P>
<P>
India can truly hope to achieve growth rates of well over seven
percent in the coming years once it achieves fiscal consolidation,
Narayanan predicted.
</P>
<P>
"If sacrifices have to be made for achieving this challenging
goal, they are well-worth making because the long-term rewards of
restructuring will benefit all Indians and will far outweigh the
temporary costs," he asserted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Indian government would announce its new
agricultural policy and vigorously pursue a coherent plan of
economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The program of disinvestment and restructuring of public sector
undertakings also needs to be accelerated, he added.
</P>
<P>
The government would also make conscious and concerted efforts
to bring the fruits of economic reforms to those regions and
communities that have so far not benefited from them, Narayanan
said.
</P>
<P>
"We must lose no more time to eradicate mass poverty, remove
illiteracy and assure basic minimum services to all our fellow
citizens," he said, adding "While accomplishing this historic task,
we must simultaneously strengthen social justice, promote gender
justice, remove regional imbalances and bridge the rural-urban
divide."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the country cannot achieve the strength and
prosperity that it desires and is capable of if vast areas and
large sections of the population remain deprived and poor.
</P>
<P>
"Faster economic growth is a precondition for removing social
and regional imbalances in development," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Manila Remains Optimistic on Investment Inflow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Wednesday that the outlook for foreign investment in the country
remains bright despite the stock market controversy and the petty
political squabbles.
</P>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission said in a report that
foreign direct equity investments in new and existing domestic
stock corporations and partnerships posted consistently positive
growth rates from 1997 to 1999, averaging 8 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
Bolstered by improved stock price index and significant entry
of new corporate listings, market capitalization of the local
stock market improved in 1999 to 1,938.6 billion pesos (48.5
billion U.S.dollars), a 54.9 percent surge from its 1997 level.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that foreign investors seemed to have weighed
the greater advantage of labor stability and international
practices in the country although there were complaints of high
power costs and increasing labor expense.
</P>
<P>
The government believed the confidence of foreign investors has
not slackened as shown by their continuous interest to put up
physical plants that could generate more jobs to the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
In the last few days, a Philippine Stock Exchange report of
alleged insider trading involving gaming firm BW Resources Corp.
has caused continued plunge in local stock market and scared off
some foreign investors.

<HEADLINE> Malaria Control Project Going on in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
embarked on a massive campaign to prevent and control malaria
nationwide, Minister Sam Ongeri for Public Health has said.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks Tuesday during the 5th national
malaria co- ordinating committee held in the capital Nairobi,
saying that his ministry will focus areas in Nandi, Kericho,
Trans Mara and Kisii in southwestern Kenya where have been hit by
highland malaria in the past year.
</P>
<P>
Ongeri noted his ministry has in its current financial year
allocated 320 million shillings (around 4.4 million U.S. dollars)
for the procurement of anti-malaria drugs.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Beth Rapuoda, a malaria export, told the committee meeting
that in the malaria-prone areas, the disease places a heavy
burden on the health system with 107 for every 1,000 children
aged below five dying of malaria annually.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Kenyan government Tuesday banned the sale of
malaria drug chloroquin over the counter and it will only be sold
to the public with a doctor's prescription.
</P>
<P>
Ongeri explained that the drug had been used to treat malaria
but had lost potency and was no longer effective in the treatment
and control of the infection.
</P>
<P>
"Studies show that it cures only 30 percent of patients while
the rest develop resistance to the killer tropical scourge." the
minister added.
</P>
<P>
Instead of chlorooquin, Ongeri said, sulphadoxine drugs have
been recommended by his ministry as the first line treatment of
malaria.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Expects More Income from Tourism Boom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar expects to
realize 54 billion Tanzanian shillings (about 67.5 million U.S.
dollars) in revenue from tourism during this year's tourist season
to begin shortly, Tanzanian media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The projected revenue will be obtained from 100,000 tourists
expected to visit the Indian Ocean islands, which lies off the
east coast of the mainland Tanzania, according to Issa Mlingoti,
director of planning in the isles' tourism commission.
</P>
<P>
The recent survey by the commission indicates that the number
of visitors would increase to 100,000 from 89,918 recorded during
the1998/99 season, Mlingoti was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The director attributed the increase to the improved transport
and telecommunication infrastructures and a well-coordinated
promotional campaign.
</P>
<P>
Over 50 percent of the estimated tourists will come from
Germany, Britain, Italy, Sweden, Denmark, Canada and South Africa,
Mlingoti added.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar, comprising the twin islands of Unguja and Pemba, as
well as a number of smaller islands, is famous for its pristine
beaches and colonial past.
</P>
<P>
The Zanzibari government has attached great importance to the
development of tourism after the exports of cloves, its major
foreign exchange earner, declined sharply due to fall of the
prices of the cash crop in the international market.
</P>
<P>
Tourism now earns about 21 percent of the isles' total gross
domestic product (GDP).

<HEADLINE> South Korean Banks' Profits Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Profits of South Korean banks
have been down since the second half of last year, due to
competitive measures such as raising deposit volume through a
boost in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Korean Wednesday said that competition to expand
the disbursement of loans through lower interest rates has also
pushed down the profits.
</P>
<P>
Among total deposits at the end of last year, the portion of
deposits bearing over eight percent in annual interest rates
accounted for 21.2 percent, up from 9.6 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
The central bank attributed the development to interest rate
rises precipitated by the Daewoo Group crisis last July and moves
by banks to secure more funds for their long-term loans.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates for loans have been sliding down since last
March when they ranged between 10 to 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
Loans bearing interest rates of 6-8 percent made up 15.5
percent of total loans outstanding in March and 36.3 percent in
December.

<P>
SEOUL, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States Forces Korea (
USFK) closed a school in its George camp in Taegu, South Korea
Wednesday morning after receiving a bomb threat.
</P>
<P>
An unidentified man called the headmaster of a school in Camp
George around 7:03 a.m. to say that he had installed bombs in the
school compound.
</P>
<P>
The school was closed immediately and the U.S. troops and South
Korean police there thoroughly combed the school grounds to search
for the bombs but found nothing.
</P>
<P>
Police suspected the man was playing a prank and imitating
other fake bomb threats to U.S. military camps in South Korea last
month.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time that the USFK has been threatened with
bomb warnings within two months.
</P>
<P>
On January 3, the USFK was tipped off with the information that
said bombs inside Camp Edward in Paju, South Korea, were to set
off next day, which caused a massive evacuation of U.S. military
personnel from the camp and some 3,000 South Korean residents
around it. On January 18, the USFK also closed an American school
inside the Eighth Army Base in central Seoul over a bomb threat.
</P>
<P>
The two bomb threats turned out to be a hoax.

<HEADLINE> Jakarta Safe Despite Red Alert, Says President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid Wednesday said that Jakarta has remained normal
despite the police announcement that they are on red alert.
</P>
<P>
"Just like today, Jakarta is on red alert due to the planned
demonstration but you do not feel it. It means that the common
people and visitors are still doing what they have to do," the
president told reporters after receiving Japanese and Indonesian
businessmen at the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
The president added: "Jakarta is in a serious alert situation.
Police intelligence have found a plan to stage a large anti-
government demonstration. But you and most of the people are not
aware about this serious situation. Security officials have made
all attempts to control the situation."
</P>
<P>
The president also affirmed that the government does not intend
to dramatize the situation.
</P>
<P>
"The government has been bringing the situation under control
so that people's activities can proceed normally," he added.
</P>
<P>
The president didn't mention any names of people or groups that
were behind the alleged demonstration.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian capital had been rife with rumors last month and
earlier this month over the possibility of the military staging a
coup against the government.
</P>
<P>
Before a cabinet meeting here on Wednesday, head of the State
Intelligence Coordinating Body (Bakin) Lt. Gen. Arie J. Kumaat
said that the police move to go on red alert on Wednesday is
merely a preventive measure.
</P>
<P>
"It would be better if (the demonstration) is not held," Kumaat
said.
</P>
<P>
Acting Coordinating Minister for Political and Security Affairs
Surjadi Soedirdja said there is no problem with the demonstration
itself.
</P>
<P>
"However, it might lead to looting," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, spokesman of the Jakarta military command Lt. Col. D.
J. Nachrowi said that until noon Wednesday, Jakarta has been safe
and that there has been no word from their commander that they are
on red alert.
</P>
<P>
"Based on procedure, the commander as head of the Jakarta
garrison should state (if the command is on red alert). But there
has been no such statement from the commander so far," Nachrowi
was quoted by the Antara News Agency as saying.

<HEADLINE> Manila, MILF to Resume Talks in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and
the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) agreed Wednesday to
resume their peace talks on March 1 in Cotabato province in the
southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
In a joint Communique signed by the government and MILF peace
panel, the two sides also agreed to impose a ceasefire starting on
February 28 as a precondition to the resumption of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled resumption of formal peace talks on Monday was
postponed after skirmishes between government troops and MILF
rebels escalated in the Southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada said earlier that any talks
about secessionism should be ruled out in the agenda of the peace
talks between the government and the MILF, which has been fighting
for an independent state in Mindanao during the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
The mainstream Moro National Liberation Front signed a peace
deal with the government in 1996 but the 12,000-strong MILF, a
breakaway faction, has continued to fight for independence.
</P>
<P>
During the last few days, government troops and MILF rebels
have been engaged in a fierce fighting in the Southern Philippines
and dozens of people have been killed or wounded.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Reduce Dominating Role of IMF, WB: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia wants to reduce the
dominating role played by the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
the World Bank (WB) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in its
economy, although the country still needs their assistance.
</P>
<P>
"We need their support and assistance but this does not mean
that their role has to be dominating," President Abdurrahman Wahid
told Japanese and Indonesian businessmen taking part in the
seminar "Filling the Cooperation on the 21st Century between
Indonesia and Japan" here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's problem is how to reduce the dominating role of
these international financial institutions, the president said,
adding that thus the task of the government apparatus is how to
respond to the people's wish.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia and IMF have signed several agreements on Indonesia's
economic situation and the fund's aid package to the country since
the start of the Asian monetary crisis in mid-1997. IMF had
offered a 43-billion-U.S- dollar loan to Indonesia to help
overcome economic crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank is a major lender to Indonesia. It provided 1.25
billion dollars to the country in the year ending June 30, 1999
and committed a further 1.5 billion dollars for the upcoming
fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> ICAO's Special Directors-Geneneral Conference Opens in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 23 (Xinhua)-- Some 140 civil aviation
directors-general and delegates from the Asia and Pacific regions
gathered here Wednesday to explore ways to deal with new
challenges facing the industry in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), in
collaboration with Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS),
is hosting the 36th Special Directors-General of Civil Aviation
Conference (Asia and Pacific Regions) in conjunction with the
Asian Aerospace 2000, Asia's premier aerospace and defense
technology exhibition and airshow.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference, designed to mark the start of the new
millennium and underscore the importance of international civil
aviation in the Asia and Pacific regions and beyond, is focusing
on development in the use of satellite-based technologies for
aircraft navigation and surveillance and ways to foster continued
and rapid implementation of these technologies in the Asia and
Pacific regions in order to enhance airspace capacity and aviation
safety.
</P>
<P>
The delegates will address the initiatives taken by ICAO and
other regional and national authorities to improve aviation safety,
particularly in the areas of aircraft operations and maintenance.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Minister for Communications &AMP; Information Technology
Yeo Cheow Tong in his opening speech noted that the aviation
industry has seen dramatic growth in the last three decades with
global passenger movements rising to a half billion in 1999 from
380 million in 1970 and global airfreight volume growing from only
6 million tons in 1970 to 58 million tons in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"There are an estimated 70,000 flights per day all over the
world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yeo also identified three major challenges facing the civil
aviation industry and regulators, listing them as the
infrastructure constraints, the cost hike and environment issues
resulting from rapid growth of the aviation industry, and the
changing dynamics of the airline industry such as increasingly
frequent airline mergers brought about by the globalization.
</P>
<P>
The delegates have toured the Asian Aerospace 2000, viewed air
display and visited Singapore aviation facilities in the past two
days.

<HEADLINE> Suspected Killer of Kaunda's Son Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Police has arrested a
man suspected to have masterminded the murder of former Zambian
President Kenneth Kaunda's son Wezi Kaunda last year, Times of
Zambia newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Lemmy Kajoba confirmed that the suspect who
was on the run for the past four months had finally been
apprehended by police Monday.
</P>
<P>
But Kajoba could not divulge the identity of the suspect who
was picked.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Home Affairs Minister Peter Machungwa told parliament
last year that the man on the run was Jack Chanda Kabongo.
</P>
<P>
The arrest of the alleged ring leader brings the number of
suspects arrested in connection with the murder of Wezi to four.
</P>
<P>
The newly-arrested suspect had been charged with murder and was
expected to appear in court soon, Kajoba said, adding that the
other three suspects are appearing in court.
</P>
<P>
Major Wezi was shot outside his Kabulonga home in the capital
Lusaka last November and the car he was driving snatched.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Tea Yield Up in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Kenya produced 27,009 tons of
tea in January, a 24.1 percent increase over the same period of
last year, according to the Tea Board of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The big January production figure was mainly a result of the
good crop due to adequate rains in the short raining season during
October and November last year, the Daily Nation newspapers
Wednesday quoted board chief executive Stephen Nkanata as saying.
</P>
<P>
However Nkanata warned that the tea production could not be
sustained due to drought and frost which hit key growing areas of
western Kenya late last month.
</P>
<P>
It is report that a devastating frost swept through western
Kenya in early hours of January 29 and destroyed between 26,000
and 49,000 acres of tea plantations.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's tea production fell to 248,000 tons in 1999 from
294,000 tons in 1998 mainly due to severe drought that persisted
for most of early last year.
</P>
<P>
Tea sector alone accounts for about a quarter of Kenya's
foreign exchange earnings and employs over two million people.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Wins Quota for Sugar Export to EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has won a quota for
exporting sugar to the European Union (EU) countries, bringing to
an end a trade battle that it has fought for many years, a senior
Zambian trade official said.
</P>
<P>
Norman Chibamba, Deputy Minister of Commerce, Trade and
Industry, disclosed this at a meeting of the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) in Lusaka Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has finally won the fight for the sugar quota which had
attracted opposition from some countries that felt threatened,
Chibamba was quoted by Wednesday's Times of Zambia newspaper as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Some countries within the African Caribbean and Pacific
grouping were bent on blocking Zambia from gaining any quota as it
threatened their market, Chibamba said.
</P>
<P>
He said Zambia accessed the quota at a recent meeting in
Brussels with Africa Caribbean and Pacific countries and EU.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister said the meeting also agreed to give Zambia
an increased Special Preferential Sugar quota (SPS) for the EU
market.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has been exporting about 12,5000 tons of sugar annually
to the EU market under the SPS arrangement.

<HEADLINE> Mines Bill Passes Second Reading in Zambian Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A mines and minerals bill to
make the sale of Zambia's remaining mines realizable passed the
second reading in the country's parliament Tuesday, state media
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bill tabled by Mines Minister Syamukayumbu Syamujaye seeks
protection of the assets of the sold mines from seizure under
litigation, the Times of Zambia newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The bill is also designed to place the responsibility of paying
 creditors of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) on the
government, Syamujaye was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that miners who contracted diseases from
their working environment as employees of ZCCM will seek
compensation from the government and not the new owners of the
mines.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government needs to give mining investors
incentives.
</P>
<P>
The bill will empower the mines minister to enter a development
 agreement with an investor on a large-scale mining corporation,
according to another newspaper, Zambia Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
The government has been trying in recent years to privatize the
country' s mine assets to attract foreign investment and advanced
technology and management to revive the ailing mining industry of
the copper producing country.
</P>
<P>
Now, the privatization process is at its last stage with
several biggest mines already being sold to foreign investors.

<HEADLINE> Burundian President Ready to Step Down: Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Burundian President
Pierre Buyoya announced Tuesday that he was ready to step down,
but would leave the decision in the hands of Burundians
themselves, a Tanzanian newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I would retire when Burundians pick another leader to rule the
country, and I'm also ready to lead the transition government if
they want me to," the president said in Tanzania's northern town
of Arusha before he left for home after attending a two-day
regional summit on Burundi peace.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya dismissed allegations that he was an obstacle to peace
in his country by saying that he had no intention of ruling
forever, the Guardian newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The Burundian president also said he was optimistic that the
ongoing negotiations would achieve a cease-fire in his country by
September this year.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya challenged facilitators of the negotiations to come up
with a methodology on how to implement peace.
</P>
<P>
The chief facilitator, former South African President Nelson
Mandela, Monday urged Burundian delegates to speed up the peace
talks to avert sufferings to innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of regrouping camps, largely criticized all over
the world, Buyoya said the camps would only be disbanded if there
is a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Earlier when addressing the summit Monday, Buyoya said only if
internal and external security of Burundi is assured, would there
be a smooth implementation of a peace agreement to be reached
later among the warring parties.
</P>
<P>
The summit ended on Tuesday night. It is to be followed by two
weeks of talks between 18 Burundian political parties and
delegations.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between the Tutsi-dominated Burundian government
forces and the Hutu rebels has killed more than 200,000 people and
uprooted more than 1.2 million since 1993 when paratroopers of the
minority Tutsis killed Burundi' s first democratically-elected
president Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu.
</P>
<P>
The rebels are seeking the ouster of President Buyoya, a
retired Tutsi military officer who seized power in a bloodless
coup in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Says 100 Boeing 747s Need Repair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Boeing spokesman Doug Webb said all 747 operators will get a
note laying out Lufthansa's findings and asking for detail on
problems at other carriers.
</P>
<P>
"It's predominantly GE (engines). It involves a few scattered
classics (747-200s and -300s), but overall it's going to be about
100 airplanes total that are affected," Webb said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it
would expect to reinforce Boeing's advice within a few days with
an airworthiness directive making the work mandatory on U.S.-
registered aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The fire extinguisher system was just one of a number of lines
of defense in dealing with an engine fire, said Eliot Brenner,
spokesman for FAA.
</P>
<P>
Lufthansa, Germany's flagship carrier, grounded all 26 of its
747-400s for inspections on Tuesday, canceling one flight.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Co., Union Agree To Resume Talks With Mediator  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Representatives from both sides agreed Tuesday to meet with a
federal mediator for new talks in an attempt to end the 14-day-old
strike.
</P>
<P>
Both sides confirmed the meetings scheduled for Thursday -- but
there were no signs either -- had changed its position.
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a sign of hope, but it doesn't mean we're
optimistic," said Bill Dugovich, spokesman for the Society of
Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA) which has
been leading the strike.
</P>
<P>
Boeing spokesman Peter Conte said the company remains
interested in seeking a resolution.
</P>
<P>
"We have not changed our previously held bargaining position
but as we have stated we are interested in seeking a resolution to
this situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The nation's top federal mediator, C. Richard Barnes, was in
Seattle talking with both sides Tuesday and was expected to be
present at Thursday's session.
</P>
<P>
Since February 9 between 17,000 and 19,000 of 20,224 employees
represented by SPEEA's Seattle area bargaining unit have struck
Boeing, with many demanding more money, a signing bonus and better
benefits.
</P>
<P>
The strike had halted all deliveries for eight days until
Boeing delivered a Boeing 747-400 wide-body to cargo carrier Atlas
Air Inc.
</P>
<P>
"We will be striving in the coming days to make more deliveries,
" Conte said. He declined to say what types of jets had been
delivered, except to say that wide-bodies and narrow-bodies were
included.
</P>
<P>
Conte also declined to identify the customers who received the
planes, saying Boeing leaves that to the buyers.
</P>
<P>
Dugovich said SPEEA doubted Boeing's delivery announcement,
adding that even if true, Boeing was still behind by at least nine
commercial jets, which cost between 40 million dollars and 187
million dollars each.
</P>
<P>
Boeing has delivered only four airplanes so far this month. In
February 1999, Boeing delivered 47 aircraft to customers.

<HEADLINE> Hewlett-Packard Unveils Low-Cost Computers For Corporate Users  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dubbed the eVectra, HP's new system weighs just eight pounds
and is 3.5 inches wide, 9.4 inches high and 10.7 inches deep,
making it roughly the size of a hard-cover dictionary, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to its small size, the eVectra, set to begin
shipping during the second quarter this year, sports a lower price
tag than typical business computers, starting at 549 dollars for a
system equipped with an Intel Celeron processor, HP said.
</P>
<P>
Another distinction between the eVectra and its business-
computer predecessors is the way its components are packaged.
Customers select specific configurations and the units are shipped
to order without any expansion slots or floppy disk drive, which
make it more reliable and easier to support, according to Eric
Candor, general manager of HP's business desktop division.
</P>
<P>
"Corporate customers have been asking for innovative, appliance-
like desktop solutions that fit easily into their specific
computing infrastructures," Cador said.
</P>
<P>
HP's eVectra line is the latest in a recent spate of low-cost,
small form-factor business computers emerging in the market.
</P>
<P>
In January, Compaq unveiled its iPaq line, which began shipping
this month. The iPaq is designed for use in corporate network
environments for employees who use their PC primarily for
mainstream office productivity applications and corporate Internet
and Intranet access.
</P>
<P>
IBM also is developing a low-cost, space-saving desktop code
named "Stardust," which is expected to begin shipping later this
year.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts said they expect the new, small form-factor PCs
to account for much of the volume in business PCs moving ahead.
</P>
<P>
"We think within three years, 60 percent of all desktop
computers shipped will be these small form-factor devices," said
Martin Reynolds, an analyst at technology research firm DataQuest.
"And that could happen even sooner."

<HEADLINE> Motorcycle Exports Increase Sharply in Chongqing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing, China's largest
and youngest municipality, last year witnessed a sharp increase in
its motorcycle exports despite a negative growth in its overall
exports.
</P>
<P>
According to Chongqing Customs, this biggest city in southwest
China exported 32.08 million dollars worth of motorcycles last
year, 7.93 times more than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Its total exports of automobiles, motorcycles and their parts
stood at 40.91 million U.S. dollars, almost two times more than in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing exported its motorcycles mainly to developing
countries including Uruguay, Nigeria, Guinea, Bangladesh and Iran.
</P>
<P>
But in recent years, its motorcycles also entered the markets
of the United States and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Automobile and motorcycle production is Chongqing's pivotal
industry. Statistics show it has about 200 auto manufacturers
which can produce both heavy and light vehicles, cars, minibuses
as well as motorcycles.

<HEADLINE> Most Women Become Literate In Ningxia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Some 150,000 rural women have
become literate in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in northwest
China since 1990 when the region launched a campaign to eradicate
illiteracy.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents 63 percent of the region's rural young
women, up 31 percentage points compared to the year 1990.
</P>
<P>
Over the past ten years the region collected 500 million yuan (
60.2 million U.S. dollars) to establish special schools for Moslem
women in an effort to reduce the illiteracy rate and improve the
educational level of the general community as a whole. The region
is a densely populated area of Moslems.
</P>
<P>
Women are also encouraged to attend pre-school education and
various professional training courses to provide them with job
opportunities. So far, more than 30 special courses have been
established in the region.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, some 25,000 children, most of whom are
girls, have been helped to return to schools. As a result, 95
percent of school-aged girls have received education, up 38
percentage points compared to the year 1990.

<HEADLINE> Successful Businesses Going to West China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, February 23 (Xinhua) -- TCL Co., one of China's big TV
set producers based in the south China's Guangdong province, has
decided to invest 120 million yuan (about 14.5 million U.S.
dollars) in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
With the investment which was originally put in its subsidiary
in Guangdong, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will be able to
produce 800,000 TCL brand TV sets this year.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very much impressed by the strong sense of service of the
autonomous government," said Jiang Hua, vice general manager of
TCL., adding that his company's decision to "go west" is correct.
</P>
<P>
TCL is one of a number of famous businesses in the coastal
cities to move west. Thanks to the involvement of the Shanghai
Fuhua Group, the Baotou Storage Cell Factory, whose bankruptcy was
announced in 1997, has been revitalized after Fuhua re-organized
the factory and introduced advanced technology and management.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan businessman Chou Tai-long has decided to invest more to
increase his company's annual welding rods production capacity to
40,000 tons, four times the current figure. The cheap energy and
labor forces as well as the preferential policies offered by the
local government can be directly converted into advantage of
business development, he said. And the Chinese government's
decision to develop the west is an excellent opportunity for all
businesses, he added. He also said that the infrastructure and
facilities in the western areas have undergone rapid development
over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
To develop the west relies not only on the governmental
investment but also on the active participation of the businesses
in the developed areas, said Yun Bulong, chairman of the
autonomous region. He believed that far-sighted entrepreneurs in
the country's developed areas as well as foreign firms will take
the advantage to make wise decision to move west.

<HEADLINE> China-Japan Trade Sees Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua)-- Trade between China and Japan
has undergone noticeable changes in recent years, the Economic
Information Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to customs statistics, total trade volume between the
two East Asian countries rose 16 percent in 1999 to reach 66.2
billion U.S. dollars. A major factor leading to the increase is
that China's exports to Japan are no longer restricted to raw
materials and primary products.
</P>
<P>
Imports from Japan including color TVs, VCRs, video cameras,
stereos and cars have been dwindling for years, as the quality of
relatively low-priced, domestically-produced products steadily
improves, and in some cases, even surpasses their Japanese
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Big Japanese brand names such as Sony, Hitachi, Toshiba have
been largely replaced by domestic names such as Haier, Changhong,
HiSense as Chinese consumers spend more money on home-made
appliances.
</P>
<P>
Imports of heavy machinery have also decreased. Poor demand in
the domestic market has forced most manufacturers to reduce
production.
</P>
<P>
However, the influx of electronic cells, automobile components
and related industrial materials and semi-manufactured products
have increased rapidly as China's electronics and car industries
have flourished in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Exports such as audio and video appliances, machinery and
electronic products have sharply increased. Industry analysts
predict that electronics and machinery products will further
increase in the future.
</P>
<P>
Textiles remain the No.1 export item to Japan.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Adult Literacy Needs Raising: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand urgently needs
an adult literacy strategy in view of a survey showing that one-
quarter of adult New Zealanders and three-quarters of the
unemployed have substandard reading and writing skills.
</P>
<P>
Papers prepared by the department concerned in accordance with
its survey said the 1997 international adult literacy study
indicated that one in four adult New Zealanders had a literacy
level below the level deemed necessary to be productive and
effective contributors to the workforce and three out of four
unemployed were below the minimum level.
</P>
<P>
The papers, which were published here Wednesday, also
highlighted problems with youth in terms of future employment.
Based on 1996 census data, one-quarter of all 16- and 17-year-olds
and one-third of Maoris in the same age group were not in
education or employment,putting them at risk of failing to make a
successful transition from school to adult life.
</P>
<P>
There was also a lack of an overarching skill development
strategy for New Zealand, they noted.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Social Services and Employment Minister Steve
Maharey was quoted as saying that putting in place a skills
development strategy is a priority for the New Zealand government.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that an announcement on a proposed
apprenticeships program is due next month.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Plans Expansion of Telecom Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government is
planning a large scale expansion of its telecommunication sector
to reach the target of two million telephone connections by the
year 2005, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
About 600 million U.S. dollars have been invested by telecom
operators like Sri Lanka Telecom, Lanka Bell and Suntel to improve
telephone services since 1994 when there were only 150,000
telephone users, said P.B. Jayasundera, secretary to the Finance
Secretary.
</P>
<P>
"Of every seven telephones, almost six have been provided since
1994," he said, adding that there are about 700,000 telephones in
use in the country today.
</P>
<P>
An estimated investment of 600 to 700 million dollars is needed
to hit the target of two million telephone users in the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka Telecom alone is expected to provide an additional
100,000 telephone connections this year.

<HEADLINE> Bush Defeats McCain in Michigan, Arizona Primaries -- Update With More Details </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senator John McCain
defeated Texas Governor George W. Bush in the primaries in
Michigan and Arizona on Tuesday night, regaining momentum in the
race for Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
In Michigan, with 67 percent of 5,637 precincts reporting,
McCain had 462,823 votes, or 50 percent while Bush had 409,490, or
44 percent. Former Ambassador Allan Keyes had just 5 percent of
the vote.
</P>
<P>
In Arizona, with 45 percent of 385 precincts reporting, McCain
won 60 percent of the vote and was declared winner. Bush got 36
percent of the vote. Keyes had 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Before the latest victories in a see-sawing Republican
nomination race, the Arizona Senator won New Hampshire's leadoff
primary in a landslide, lost the follow-up showdown in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
In the two latest primaries, Bush won an overwhelming majority
of bedrock Republicans and McCain reaching outside the party for a
similar-sized force of Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
"This is a marathon and I'm going to be in it all the way to
the end, and some primaries you win and sometimes you don't," said
Bush, who was humbled by the defeat.
</P>
<P>
McCain, a former Navy pilot who spent five years and a half in
a Vietnam war prison camp, is essentially running for president
against the Republican establishment.
</P>
<P>
"Today, Michigan sent a powerful message across America that
our party needs a real reform from the real reformer," McCain said
at his victory speech in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
"We took on the 'iron triangle 'of big money, lobbyists and
legislation, and we won another battle," he added.
</P>
<P>
McCain said his mission as a presidential hopeful is to bring
about an end to "Washington pork barrel spending," while
rebuilding the military, cutting taxes and "protecting the unborn".
</P>
<P>
Heading into a high-stakes spring of Republican races, Bush and
McCain agreed that Michigan's election was pivotal.
</P>
<P>
In the Michigan battleground, McCain supporters said they liked
him because he stood up for his beliefs.
</P>
<P>
Bush voters were more affluent, anti-abortion and strongly
conservative. They cited his conservative values as their top
reason for voting for him. Religious right voters also preferred
Bush.
</P>
<P>
Bush, a front-runner backed by the Republican establishment,
tried to use his advantages of money, organization and
endorsements to weaken McCain's candidacy Tuesday, two weeks away
from their showdown on March 7, a "Super Tuesday" when more than a
dozen states hold primaries.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead to the March 7 contests, Bush stopped in Missouri
Tuesday, then flew to California after the voting in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
McCain's main focus will be California. He plans to spend seven
of the next 12 days to campaign in the state.

<HEADLINE> UPS Launches China Route Case Web Site  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Parcel Service
(UPS) Tuesday launched a new Web site as part of its ongoing
campaign to win the right to fly directly into China.
</P>
<P>
The world's largest express carrier and package delivery
company devotes the site to providing information about its
application for the new designation, which is currently pending
before the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT).
</P>
<P>
Under the bilateral agreement between China and the United
States, the DOT will pick one additional carrier to begin serving
China in April 2001.
</P>
<P>
Competing with UPS are American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and
Polar Air Cargo. In addition, the three carriers that currently
fly into China -- Federal Express, Northwest Airlines and United
Airlines -- all want the right to offer more flights.
</P>
<P>
UPS has served customers in China since 1988 through its agent
partnership and its services have reached 108 Chinese cities
through its joint venture in Beijing and representative offices in
Guangzhou and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
"But since UPS cannot land its own aircraft in China, it is
reaching the limits of its ability to serve U.S. consumers and U.S.
companies," the company said. "For UPS to compete its Asia-Pacific
air networks, it needs the rights to land in China."
</P>
<P>
The company said that awarding the new designation to UPS will
not only expand much-needed competition in the Chinese marketplace,
but it will provide a vital increase in the air express and air
freight market -- giving U.S. businesses access to the Chinese
market with lower costs and better service.
</P>
<P>
The competing airlines have been stressing that they will be
able to carry both passengers and cargo.

<HEADLINE> NE China's Dalian Sets up Venture Capital Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Dalian, a summer seaside resort
in northeast China's Liaoning Province, has founded its first
venture capital company in a bid to help get more scientific
research results out of the labs and onto the market.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, Dalian Science and Technology
Venture Capital Company is installed under the Productive Forces
Promotion Center of Dalian City Committee of Science and
Technology.
</P>
<P>
A company executive said that his company would make investment
in some high and new technological enterprises in Dalian, offer
services involving personnel, management and operations, and
introduce investments from other venture capital companies and
venture funds outside Dalian to support development of carefully
selected scientific projects in the seaside city.
</P>
<P>
According to him, his company has started to aid two scientific
and technological projects, and has found 60 million yuan of
venture investment from outside Dalian, and plans to provide two
dozens of enterprises with follow-up services in a bid to improve
the qualities of the managing personnel from the enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In China, venture capital companies are very few at the moment.
As a result, many scientific professionals have had to place their
research results on the shelves for having difficulty in finding
venture capital to finance their projects. A great number of small
and medium-sized high-tech companies also have been shut down in
the middle of the development process because of fund shortage.
</P>
<P>
With the support of the central government, more venture
capital companies will be set up in the future and more scientific
research results will be turned into productive forces and
producing benefits of scale.

<HEADLINE> 25 Pct of Indonesia's Overseas Funds Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- At least a quarter of the
Indonesian funds deposited overseas by local business people has
returned and been reinvested to boost the economic recovery
program of the country, a local report said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"At least 20 percent to 25 percent of the money which flowed
out of the country has returned, and I believe in the next one or
two years all the money will come back," the Jakarta Post daily
quoted Chairman of the Indonesian Business Development Council
Sofyan Wanandi as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wanandi estimated that total domestic funds deposited overseas
reached around 15 billion U.S. dollars, far below some estimates
which put the figure at 80 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"And 3 billion U.S. dollars had been returned to Indonesia,"
Wanandi said, adding that those bringing their money back to
Indonesia were medium-sized business people who used the funds to
finance the expansion of their businesses, especially in the
retail sector, while large business owners would continue to keep
their money outside of Indonesia as "most of them owe massive
debts to the Indonesian Banking Restructuring Agency."
</P>
<P>
He also said that large business people do not yet want to
return their money as they are still warried about the security in
the country.
</P>
<P>
"They still have a wait and see attitude," he said, but
expressing confidence that both local people and foreigners would
begin investing in the country when the economy showed significant
signs of recovery and security and law enforcement improved.

<P>
DHAKA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- a two-day training workshop on"
software export marketing" organized by the Dhaka Chamber of
Commerce and Industry in cooperation with German Technical
Cooperation is held here Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
While inaugurating the workshop, information technology (IT)
specialist Jamilaur Reza Choudhury said Bangladesh is facing some
specific hindrances in the way to acquire the reasonable market
share of the global trade in IT, which he put at about one
trillion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Choudhury said the specific hindrances facing the country
include lack of publicity of existing and potential capability of
Bangladesh in the field of computer software, lack of
infrastructural facilities and absence of political stability
needed for the business.
</P>
<P>
In order to enter the market of software, Bangladesh should
initially go for subcontracting as the direct breakthrough would
be rather difficult at this stage, he observed.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Urged to Set Up Democratic System to Combat Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia, the third most
populous country in the world, now needs an openly democratic
system to minimize and combat corruption practices, an observer
here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"There are two conditions under which corruption practices can
be eliminated, the first is an openly democratic system, and the
second is the establishment of anticorruption commission,"
economist Didik J Rachbini told Xinhua Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that a transparent democratic system is an indirect
strategy to abate corruption and bribe practices. "And the law
enforcement is a direct strategy. So there should also be
consistent law enforcement," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Abdurrahman Wahid on Tuesday warned all corrupt state
officials and legislators to be prepared to face tough measures as
he would put strict and clean officials in charge of weeding out
corruption.
</P>
<P>
The president was confident that with their help, the
government could accelerate antigraft measures.
</P>
<P>
"But the (establishment of) an anticorruption commission will
be useless, unless there is also a conducive democratic system,"
Rachbini said, adding that the most serious corruption practices
in the country always take place in power environment in the form
of abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
"That is a grand corruption," Rachbini said.

<HEADLINE> McCain Defeats Bush in Michigan, Arizona </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senator John McCain
defeated Texas Governor George W. Bush in the primaries in
Michigan and Arizona on Tuesday night, regaining momentum in the
race for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
In Michigan, with 37 percent of 5,637 precincts reporting,
McCain had 50 percent of the vote while Bush had 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
In Arizona, with 2 percent of 385 precincts reporting, McCain
won 53 percent of the vote and was declared winner. Bush got 44
percent.
</P>
<P>
McCain won New Hampshire's leadoff primary in a landslide, lost
the follow-up one in South Carolina before his two most recent
victories.
</P>
<P>
In the two primaries, McCain gained support from mainly
Democrats and independents, while Bush won a majority of bedrock
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
"This is a marathon and I'm going to be in it all the way to
the end," said Bush; "some primaries you win and some you don't,"
he added, humbled by the defeat.
</P>
<P>
McCain, a former Navy pilot who spent five and a half years in
a Vietnam war prison camp, is essentially running for president
against the Republican Party establishment.
</P>
<P>
"Today, Michigan sent a powerful message across America that
our party needs a real reform from the real reformer," McCain said
after knowing the result of Michigan primary, which was pivotal
acknowledged by both candidates.
</P>
<P>
In the Michigan primary, McCain supporters said they liked him
because he stood up for his beliefs.
</P>
<P>
Voters for Bush were more affluent and conservative. They cited
his conservative values as their top reason for voting for him.
Religious right voters also preferred Bush.
</P>
<P>
Bush, a front-runner backed by the Republican establishment,
failed in using his advantages of money, organization and
endorsements to weaken McCain's candidacy Tuesday, two weeks from
the showdown on March 7, a "Super Tuesday" when more than a dozen
states hold primaries.

BRUSSELS -- The European Union (EU) needs an overall Internet
strategy to help it catch up with the United States in the fields
such as e-commerce, EU Commissioner Frits Bolkestein said Tuesday.

"Internet retailing today accounts for only 0.2 percent of the
total European Union retail market compared with 1.2 percent in
the United States," Bolkestein told the European Parliament's
economic and monetary committee. "This means that EU citizens
account for 29 U.S. dollars out of 100 U.S. dollars spent on U.S.
websites." (EU-US-Internet)

WASHINGTON -- U.S. business economists revised up Tuesday their
estimates of economic growth for 2000, saying that the Federal
Reserve needs to tighten further its monetary policy to get the
economy to slow measurably.
</P>
<P>
The National Association for Business Economics (NABE)
predicted in its latest economic outlook that the gross domestic
product (GDP), the nation's total economic output, would slow
slightly to 3.8 percent this year, after three straight years of
growth at 4 percent or higher. But the group's forecast of 3.8
percent GDP growth this year reflected an upward revision from a
November survey which had projected a 3.2 percent increase. (US-

<HEADLINE> U.S. Firm Unveils Fastest, Lowest-Power Chips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Texas Instruments (TI)
company, the world's leader in digital signal processing solutions,
introduced the fastest and lowest-power digital signal processors
(DSP) on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
These new programmable DSPs will be the first to provide the
real-time speed and the power efficiency required for personal
wireless multimedia Internet appliances, according to a news
release from the company.
</P>
<P>
The first new DSP, called C64x, will deliver 10 times the
performance of today's fastest DSP, the company said, adding it
will drive infrastructure applications such as broadband to the
home and third-generation wireless base stations.
</P>
<P>
Operating at speeds up to 1.1 gigahertz (or 1,100 megahertz),
C64x can compute nearly 9 billion instructions per second.
</P>
<P>
With these performing capabilities, it will be possible and
practical to deliver huge amounts of personalized data, video and
voice over a single broadband line into the home and enable third-
generation base stations to send multimedia signals to wireless
handsets.
</P>
<P>
The second new DSP, the energy saving C55x, requires only 15
percent of the power of the most power-efficient DSP available
today, but delivers five times the performance, the company
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The company said that C55x, targeted at Internet appliances
that will combine voice, video and data, will enable a new breed
of sleek, personal, portable third-generation phones, digital
music players and digital cameras -- or even equipment that
combines all three into one -- with a constant on-line link to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
Low power means that batteries will last weeks instead of days.
Large cellular phone makers have already chosen the C55x for their
third-generation handsets.
</P>
<P>
"With these chips, one can not only make a wireless call, but
also access the Internet to check his stocks, run a personal
electro-cardiogram and E-mail it to his doctor, send a digital
photo of a suspect to the police station, all while listening to
music downloaded from the web," said Mike Hames, vice president
and manager of worldwide digital signal processing for TI.
</P>
<P>
"With the C64x and C55x announced today, TI is providing
Ericsson with the processing power to create breakthrough products
for the new telecommunications world," said Gosta Lemne, Ericsson
high-level executive.
</P>
<P>
Texas Instruments provides innovative DSP and mixed signal/
analog technologies to more than 30,000 customers in 25 countries,
with 48 percent market share worldwide.

of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
26-year-old Seles needed 55 minutes to defeat the 140th-ranked
Lubiani.

WASHINGTON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Golden State Warriors
leading scorer Antawn Jamison will miss the remainder of the
season after her underwent exploratory arthroscopic surgery on his
left knee today in Los Angeles.

acquried in a three-team trade last week.
</P>
<P>
Jamison is averaging a team-best 19.6 points and 8.4 rebounds
in 43 games with the Warriors this season. He was selected fourth

<HEADLINE> ICBC to Acquire HK Union Bank (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- China's largest commercial
bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), told
Xinhua today that it will acquire the Union Bank of Hong Kong Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Li Lihui, vice-president of ICBC, said his bank is negotiating
with the Hong Kong Merchants (Holdings) Co. on related terms of
the acquisition.
</P>
<P>
Although no specific agreement has been so far reached, he said,
the negotiation is going smoothly.
</P>
<P>
If the acquisition is finalized with success, it will be the
first case for China's banking sector to acquire an overseas
listed bank.
</P>
<P>
Li further noted that ICBC's acquisition plan has been given
green light by the relevant departments under the State Council,
the central government.
</P>
<P>
The ICBC has been expanding its business rapidly in Hong Kong
over the past few years, with an ICBC branch, a controlling
investment bank and a share-holding restricted license bank in the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR). However, it is in
urgent need of a retailing network in its business portfolios in
the SAR.

<HEADLINE> Fuel, Milk Prices to Go Up in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government
decided on Tuesday to hike the prices of cooking gas, diesel and
kerosene nationwide, as well as the price of milk supplied under
the Delhi Milk Scheme (DMS), local media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The new liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), diesel and kerosene
prices are expected to be announced in the Lok Sabha, the Indian
lower house, on Thursday, the Hindustan Times reported.
</P>
<P>
However, the newspaper said, the price hike for DMS milk will
take immediate effect, with the prices for toned milk and double
toned milk surging to 14 rupees and 11 rupees per liter,
respectively, from the original 7 and 6 rupees per liter.
</P>
<P>
With the latest revision in DMS milk prices, the central
government can make an annual subsidy saving of about 577 million
rupees (13.42 million U.S. dollars), local media said.
</P>
<P>
The government cited the spiraling subsidy bill on LPG and
kerosene, and the firming up of crude oil prices in the
international markets as reasons for the fuel price hikes.
</P>
<P>
Though the final price hike on LPG, diesel and kerosene has not
been announced yet, official sources said that a subsidy of 7.55
rupees per liter on kerosene and 144 rupees per LPG cylinder would
be reduced.
</P>
<P>
According to the Petroleum Ministry, crude oil prices in India
have gone up to 7,540 rupees (175.35 U.S. dollars) per ton this
month from 3,210 rupees (74.65 dollars) per ton in February, 1999.

especially at Kosovska Mitrovica, when he met with his Albanian
counterpart Paskal Milo in Rome Tuesday night, a statement from

</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Dini urged the Albanian authorities to play

He also stressed the importance of improving Albania's
international credibility and its role in the Balkans.

<HEADLINE> Hui Muslims to Make Pilgrimage to Mecca </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Some 222 Muslims of the Hui
ethnic group from northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region
will fly from Beijing to Mecca, Islam's holiest site in Saudi
Arabia, on Friday to participate in the hajj ritual.
</P>
<P>
Many Huis have prospered thanks to the country's reform and
opening policy over the past two decades, which makes it possible
for them to afford the pricey trip at a cost of 27,000 yuan (3,253
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
But for years it was unthinkable for poverty-stricken Hui
Muslims to make the pilgrimage to Mecca, said Wang Deyi, an
official in charge of Ningxia's religious affairs.
</P>
<P>
The average per capita income of farmers in Huasi Village was
only dozens of yuan before the founding of the autonomous region
in 1958. The current net income of local farmers on average has
climbed to 3,000 yuan (362 dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
Muslims are expected to make the hajj pilgrimage at least once
in their lifetime.
</P>
<P>
Before 1978, only seven Hui Muslims from Ningxia had ever
traveled to Mecca for the hajj, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, when the Chinese government began to organize
delegations to Mecca, over 2,000 Hui Muslims from the region have
participated in the ritual.
</P>
<P>
The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is home to 1.78 million Hui
Muslims, accounting for one-third of its total population.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong's foreign trade

dollars in January this year, according to sources with the
provincial customs.
</P>
<P>
Exports topped 7.3 billion U.S. dollars in the first month, up
63 percent over the same period last year, while imports jumped
28 percent to 5.4 billion U.S. dollars.

electric heaters, blenders and ceiling fans. The export items
collectively earned 2.3 billion U.S. dollars last year, up 13
percent compared with 1998.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong's home appliance exports mainly involved the
processing trade, which accounted for 85 percent of the exports
last year. The exports were sent to North American, and Asian and
European countries and regions.
</P>

Beginning this year, the Customs moved to bring small home
appliances exports under strict quality control to weed out shoddy

<HEADLINE> Honduras Protests Against Nicaragua Over Territorial Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Honduran government
lodged a "strong protest against the armed attack launched"
Saturday by a Nicaraguan patrol boat "in Honduran jurisdiction
waters in the Fonseca Gulf," official sources said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The protest noted that it is very suspicious that such an
incident happened after aggressive statements made by general
Joaquin Cuadra, Commander of the Nicaraguan Army, who tried to
enlarge the differences between the two countries instead of
peaceful talks encouraged by the Organization of American States (
OAS).
</P>
<P>
Tegucigalpa charged that a Nicaraguan patrol boat got close to
Honduran waters in an attempt to capture its fishermen and fired
shots when a Honduran patrol approached.
</P>
<P>
The clash occurred just 11 days after the two Central American
countries signed an agreement in El Salvador, agreeing to restrict
military and police actions in the disputed waters.
</P>
<P>
Honduras and Nicaragua have a historical dispute on both
Caribbean and Pacific maritime boundaries. Tensions were
aggravated last year when Honduras ratified a 13-year-old treaty
with Colombia, recognizing Colombian sovereignty on the San Andres
archipelago in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua, which also claims the archipelago, cut trade
relations with Honduras in protest.
</P>
<P>
According to the Managua Government, two Honduran patrol boats
entered Nicaraguan waters in the Fonseca Gulf last Saturday and
shot at a Nicaraguan boat on two occasions.

<HEADLINE> Space Shuttle Endeavour Returns to Earth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Space Shuttle Endeavour
returned to the earth on Tuesday night after finishing an earth-
mapping mission that acquired extensive terrain data for
scientists.
</P>
<P>
Before touching down at the Kennedy Space Center at 6:22 pm (
2322 GMT), the shuttle swung around the earth for an extra circle
to avoid high winds.
</P>
<P>
During the 11-day flight, six astronauts from the United States,
Germany and Japan worked on two shifts conducting the earth-
mapping tasks with two radar antennas, one on the shuttle and the
other floating in space.
</P>
<P>
The mapping covered 75 percent of the earth's surface, and the
data could reportedly fill more than 300 digital tapes.
</P>
<P>
While working, the radar was supported by a retractable mast
which was 60 meters long when fully extended. A section of radar
equipment was so far the longest object ever deployed in space.
</P>
<P>
NASA will copy the 300-plus digital tapes and then send them to
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at NASA and its partner National Imagery and Mapping
Agency estimate that it will take them one to two years to analyze
all the data. Based on the data, scientists can draw the most
precise earth terrain maps.
</P>
<P>
The high resolution maps will help improve the aim of missiles,
and provide more precise navigation for fighter pilots and ground
troops.

<HEADLINE> South China Financial Sector To Open Wider </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, the provincial
capital of Guangdong, has been targeted as an experimental city
for foreign banks to do business in Chinese currency.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Guanghua, deputy head of Guangzhou Branch of the People's
Bank of China (PBOC), the central bank, said the move will help
speed up the opening of the financial sector in south China.
</P>
<P>
As a policy-making bank, PBOC operates nine branches to oversee
financial business and step-up macro management of foreign banks
that deal in renminbi. PBOC Guangzhou Branch oversees financial
business in Guangdong Province and neighboring Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region and Hainan Province.
</P>
<P>
Currently in south China, only selected foreign banks in
Shenzhen, a special economic zone in Guangdong, have permits to do
renminbi business.
</P>
<P>
At a symposium in Shenzhen, Zhang pledged that his branch would
do more to attract foreign banks to south China, including giving
them preferential treatment.
</P>
<P>
Zhang urged greater efforts be made to boost agent business
among banks from Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao and to speed up
development of cheque settlement in Hong Kong dollars in Guangdong
and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Management over border trade settlements with Vietnam also will
be improved, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
South China has 58 overseas financial organizations, accounting
for one third of the country's total. The amount of hard currency
deposits and loan grants with these overseas financial and banking
organizations makes up 4.5 percent and 21.1 percent of the
corresponding total in south China hard currency market.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chinese banks in south China have established agent
business ties with well over 5,000 banking organizations from 140
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, south China is ranked first in the country
in terms of the amount of deposits and loans granted in both
Chinese and foreign hard currencies, and for the number of
financial organizations.
</P>
<P>
By late 1999, the sum of deposits in Chinese currency in banks
in Guangdong, Guangxi and Hainan climbed to 1,786.1 billion yuan,
accounting for 16.4 percent of the country's total, and the amount
of outstanding loans stood at 1,337.5 billion yuan, making up 14.3
percent of the overall figure.

NANJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Some 1.34 million foreigners
visited Jiangsu Province in east China last year, up 16.5 percent
over the previous year, the provincial statistics bureau reported.

<HEADLINE> China's Oil Import Exceeds 40 Million Tons in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- China needs to spend more
efforts on oil extraction as it is becoming more dependent on
imported crude oil and oil products, an official of the
petrochemical industry said recently.
</P>
<P>
Chen Geng, deputy director of the State Administration of
Petroleum and Chemical Industries, told China Chemical Industry
News that China imported a record total of more than 40 million
tons of crude oil and oil products last year, which accounted for
20 percent of the country's consumption.
</P>
<P>
China had for several decades been more than self-sufficient in
crude oil but started importing crude oil in 1993, following
increasing domestic demand for oil.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that China has vast potential resources of crude oil
and natural gas, but China's per capita share of crude oil
resources is only one-fifth of the world's average and prospecting
and exploration has become more and more difficult.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that China's demand for crude oil will grow at an
annual speed of four percent in the 21st century and that China's
net crude oil import is expected to reach 42 million tons this
year.

BRUSSELS -- European Union (EU) needs an overall Internet
strategy to help it catch up the United States in the fields such
as e-commerce, EU Commissioner Frits Bolkestein said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Internet retailing today accounts for only 0.2 percent of the
total European Union retail market compared with 1.2 percent in
the United States," Bolkestein told the European Parliament's
economic and monetary committee. "This means that EU citizens
account for 29 U.S. dollars out of 100 U.S. dollars spent on U.S.
websites." (EU-US-Internet)

reformist members of parliament would lead to rapprochement
between the two nations after more than 20 years of hostility.

<HEADLINE> Republic of Serbia Lifts Control on Domestic Oil Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The government of Yugoslav
Republic of Serbia decided Tuesday to lift its control on the
supply of petroleum products in the domestic market in a bid to
end oil deals in the black market, the official Tanjug news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The government on the same day endorsed a proposal submitted by
the Serbian Oil Industrial Business and Belgrade Oil Company aimed
at improving the oil products market in the republic and set the
retail prices for gasoline and diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, retail prices for oil and diesel fuel in
the Republic of Serbia will be lowered by 20 percent on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Refueling the vehicles with foreign licenses requires payment
in foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
The government of Serbia said that improving the supply of oil
products will help lower overall market prices, maintain the
stability of prices and the economy, ensure and increase public
revenues used for national reconstruction and the realization of
social plans.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia has witnessed an unprecedented shortage in oil
supplies since NATO's bombardment. Each person is rationed with 20
liters of gasoline per month. The often empty gas pumps drive
people to the black market.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Uber Cup Team Warned of Tough Task Ahead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian National Sports
Council(KONI) has warned the national badminton team against being
overly complacent as the road to the Uber Cup championship is
potentially arduous.
</P>
<P>
"Use the two months for hard training and implant the
determination to revive the memory that Indonesia were once the
Uber Cup champions," KONI Deputy Chairman Arie Sudewo was quoted
by the Indonesian Observer Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
After the winding up of the qualifying round in India, the Uber
Cup championship -- a biennial world women's badminton event --
will resume with the final round in Malaysia in May. Indonesia has
qualified along with South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, team manager Christian Hadinata said that after
escaping the humiliation of failing to qualify, the task which
lies ahead is potentially tougher.
</P>
<P>
"We have to learn a lot from the performance of the other teams,
especially when it comes to preparation. We have to prepare
consistently without having to wait for an order as our past
badminton players used to do," Hadinata said.
</P>
<P>
He recalled some of the players from the South Korea and China'
s Hong Kong teams, who, he said, had superior skills and were in
better physical shape than the Indonesians.
</P>
<P>
In New Delhi last week, three-time champions Indonesia opened
the matches with a 4-1 win over India. But they were visibly
blushing in the following tie when they were beaten by the unrated
Hong Kong before bouncing back to seal the Malaysian berth.

<HEADLINE> Listeria Bacilli Panic Kept Out of China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Listeria bacilli, which
reportedly tainted food and killed seven people in France, have
been kept out of China, said an official with the State
Administration for Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine (SAIQ).
</P>
<P>
Alarmed by the increasing number of tainted food cases
worldwide, China has tightened its inspection and quarantine work
on meat products from France. "Any products containing the bacilli
will be destroyed or returned to the exporters," the official said.
</P>
<P>
China has imported only a small portion of French pork products
through ports in Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Shanghai, and "all the
quarantine bureaus in these areas have adopted measures to keep
the bacilli-tainted meat products from entering China," according
to the official.
</P>
<P>
Many experts said that people need not worry. Listeria bacilli
live half an hour at 55 degrees centigrade and will die within 40
seconds at a temperature of 85 degrees centigrade.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, the SAIQ issued an urgent notice banning
imports of birds and their products from Italy, France and
Luxembourg to prevent the avian influenza and Newcastle disease.
</P>
<P>
The animal husbandry and veterinary bureau under the Ministry
of Agriculture also issued a circular cautioning quarantine
workers to prevent any animal epidemic outbreak in this spring.

<HEADLINE> China's First Volcano Park Opens to Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TENGCHONG, YUNNAN PROVINCE, February 23 (Xinhua) -- China's
first volcano park has opened to the public following the recent
completion of its initial phase in Yunnan Province's Tengchong
County which borders Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The Tengchong Volcano Park has eight groups of volcanoes and
volcanic geographic features such as a crater lake and beautiful
ravines.
</P>
<P>
Creation of the park began in January last year and now covers
an area of 81.04 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
There are 97 volcanoes in Tengchong County with ravine area
covering a total of 1,038 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Tengchong volcanoes, the youngest volcanoes in the world, are
considered " a museum for volcanic geology," where scientists from
home and abroad are able to do research work on volcanoes,
subterranean heat sources, earth structure, and earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the countries where volcanoes remain most
active, with four "volcano kingdom," among which the Tengchong
volcanoes are believed to be the best well-preserved and most
complete ones. The other three "kingdoms" are in northeast China's
Heilongjiang province, north China' Shanxi province and northwest
China's Xinjiang Urgur Autonomous Region, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say the volcano park not only adds a scenic spot
to the tourist attractions of the province, but also will serve as
China's largest center for the study of volcanoes and for popular
science education.

<HEADLINE> Kiefer Advances in London Indoor Tennis  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Second seed Nicolas Kiefer of
Germany advanced into the second round with a 6-2, 6-3 victory
over Roger Federer of Switzerland at the London indoor tennis
tournament on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A double break in the opening set saw Federer run away with it
on the London Arena center court as Kiefer sprayed a series of
groundstroke errors beyond the baseline and into the net.
</P>
<P>
The German world number four rallied early in the second set as
he began to move around the court better and Federer was forced to
save three break points in the fourth game.
</P>
<P>
Federer immediately broke the German's service as errors again
riddled Kiefer's play.
</P>
<P>
A series of huge winners from the back of the court put paid to
Kiefer's challenge as Federer closed out the victory.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Swedish fourth seed Thomas Enqvist whipped Adrian
Voinea 6-1, 6-4 to reach the second round.
</P>
<P>
The world number 12 wasted little time on center court,
overpowering his Romanian opponent with thunderous groundstrokes
and accurate serving.
</P>
<P>
Voinea never got into his stride in the opening set as Enqvist
moved him around the court before applying the killer blow.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian held his own a little better in the second set but
could not stay with the Swede who plays Karol Kucera in the second
round.
</P>
<P>
Kucera reached the second round by easing past Jiri Novak in
straight sets. The Slovak needed two breaks of serve in the
opening set before winning it 7-5. A single break in the second
set was enough to clinch it 6-3.
</P>
<P>
France's Jerome Golmard beat Juan Carlos Ferrero of Spain 6-2,
6-2 to set up a clash with British fifth seed Greg Rusedski on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov faces Ukrainian Andrei
Medvedev also on Wednesday while Tim Henman, seeded third, takes
on Argentine Mariano Zabaleta for a place in the second round.

<HEADLINE> Keegan Names Team for Game Against Argentina  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Chelsea captain Dennis Wise was
the surprise inclusion in the England side named by Kevin Keegan
to face Argentina at Wembley.
</P>
<P>
The midfielder, who is currently charged with misconduct
following his alleged involvement in the Blues' tunnel bust-up
with Wimbledon, replaces Paul Ince in central midfield.
</P>
<P>
Leeds winger Jason Wilcox is given a chance to see if he is the
answer to the side's long-standing left-sided problem, while up
front Leicester striker Emile Heskey makes his first start for his
country.
</P>
<P>
Heskey is named in the starting eleven following four
substitute appearances as he partners Alan Shearer, although Kevin
Phillips may still be involved in Wednesday night's game at some
stage.
</P>
<P>
Wise, 33, did appear as a substitute against Belgium in the
friendly at Sunderland last October but his last start for his
country was way back in December 1995 against Portugal.
</P>
<P>
However, along with David Beckham and Paul Scholes, he makes up
a midfield trio at the heart of a 5-3-2 formation picked by Keegan
for Wednesday night's game.
</P>
<P>
Wilcox has been included in an England line-up for the first
time since he came on as a substitute against France under Howard
Wilkinson just over 12 months ago.
</P>
<P>
His form since his recent move to Elland Road and his left-
footed ability have earned him a recall at wing-back.
</P>
<P>
In defence, Gareth Southgate partners Sol Campbell and Martin
Keown, while there is surprisingly no place for Rio Ferdinand, who
-along with Gareth Barry - will be hoping to come off the bench at
some stage.
</P>
<P>
However, Keegan's decision not to give Ferdinand a starting
place now leaves the West Ham defender with an uphill battle to
put himself in the frame for the Euro 2000 line-up given the lack
of opportunities which remain before the tournament begins.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Change of Rules Affects Goalkeepers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A new rule governing how long
goalkeepers can hold the ball comes into effect from July 1, the
president of FIFA Sepp Blatter said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Blatter said at a seminar for referees that goalkeepers will in
the near future be allowed to hold the ball for only six seconds
before releasing it for play.
</P>
<P>
The new rule was approved at the weekend by FIFA's
International Board and replaces the current one whereby a
goalkeeper is allowed to make four steps with the ball before
releasing it.
</P>
<P>
In Blatter's opinion the new regulation would not apply to the
European Championship from June 10 to July 2 in the Belgium and
the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
A goalline camera would also betried out in April in London
according to Blatter. The referee will get an acoustic signal
which indicates whether the ball crossed the goalline or not.
</P>
<P>
There were no plans to introduce video playbacks to assist
referees in disputed judgements, Blatter added.

<HEADLINE> German Anti-doping Agency to Begin Work at End of 2000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The German National Anti-Doping
Agency (NADA) will begin its work at the end of 2000, the
president of the umbrella sports organisation (DSB) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the DSB Manfred von Richthofen said on German
Radio that there are still organisational questions between DSB
representative and the sport federations.
</P>
<P>
So the NADA will be a cooperative effort between the DSB, the
National Olympic Committee and the German interior ministry, von
Richthofen added.
</P>
<P>
The head of the sports committee for the German parliament (
Bundestag), Julius Beucher, said the NADA will have no affiliation
with the National Institute for Sports Sciences in Cologne.
</P>
<P>
"A connection with a state-run organisation is in our opinion
entirely out of the question," said von Richthofen. "We want a
trully independent anti-doping agency." In his opinion the agency
will be located in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
But the question how the NADA will be financed is still open.
Von Richthofen is scheduled to meet in the coming months with
interior officials. The state has until now only paid for work
done at the doping control labs in Kreischa and Cologne.

MADRID, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Spain's Javier Llorente won the

Tuesday as Italian rider Marco Pantani made an modest comeback to
competition in Valencia, Spain.
</P>
<P>

The Italian was expelled from last year's Giro d'Italia for
failing a blood test but later was cleared of the doping charge by
the Italian Olympic Committee.

<HEADLINE> GCC Willing to Maintain Stable World Oil Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Oil ministers of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) member states voiced willingness to
maintain a stable oil market in cooperation with other producing
countries.
</P>
<P>
At the end of their 23rd conference here on Wednesday, the oil
ministers said in their communique that they have consulted with
other oil producing countries on the best ways to serve the
interests of the producing and consuming states without harming the
world economy.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the conference was to exchange views among the GCC
oil ministers on the current and future developments in the world
oil markets and form a common position to stabilize the markets,
the communique said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers expressed satisfaction with the tangible
improvement of oil prices in the world markets, which have hit a
nine-year record high of 29 U.S. dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
The GCC meeting was held at a time when the oil prices hold
high, which has aroused concerns among consuming countries,
especially the United States. The countries want the producers to
raise their production to bring down the oil prices.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC), which provides 13 percent of the world oil supply, has not
announced its future production policy when its year-long output
curb agreement expires in March.
</P>
<P>
OPEC oil ministers will meet on March 27 to decide the policy of
next period.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richarson is coming to Saudi Arabia
and Kuwait, the two major OPEC members, to discuss the current
situation and future development in the world oil markets.

<HEADLINE> Israel Launches Fresh Attacks on South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli occupation forces in
south Lebanon shelled Wednesday afternoon areas in the western
sector of south Lebanon, but no casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
Reports from inside the occupied zone said that the Israeli
troops also arrested Lebanese citizen Nimer Farghal, 48, and his
daughter Sawsan, 27, who were led to the al-khayam detention camp.
But the reports did not give reasons for the arrest.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lebanese guerrillas hit back and attacked Israeli
positions in the security zone Israel set up in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Exchange of attacks between Israeli troops and Hezbollah
guerrillas, which have been spearheading a war since 1985 to oust
the Israeli occupation forces from the country, have increased
recently following the deadlock of Israeli-Syrian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah Deputy Secretary General Naem Qasem said that Israel
will have to return to the 1996 April Understanding, adding that
that katyushas will remain "a symbol" to protect the civilians.
</P>
<P>
The Understanding that was signed following Israel's Grapes of
Wrath attacks on Lebanon in 1996 bans raids on or from civilian
areas. But Israel bombed three Lebanese power stations and wounded
20 civilians earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Israel's blitz on Lebanese civilian facilities have unleashed a
storm of criticism among Arab states.

The diplomatic tiff exploded even ahead of his arrival, when
French Foreign Ministry announced his visiting itinerary, which
failed to mention Jerusalem, where some meetings between Jospin and
Israeli officials will take place, as a venue of Jospin's stay in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, Jospin's meeting with Faisal Husseini, Palestinian
National Authority's minister for Jerusalem affairs, was announced
with a Jerusalem venue.
</P>
<P>
Israel has claimed Jerusalem as its "eternal and indivisible
capital," including the Arab eastern part it annexed after the 1967
Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
Some diplomatic sources in Jerusalem said that it is well-known
that France, like other European Union countries, never recognizes
Israel's position on the Jerusalem issue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinians, who consider Jerusalem, or at least
its eastern part, as capital of their future independent state, may
be encouraged by Paris' hint in the visiting itinerary schedule.
</P>
<P>
They were frustrated just one day earlier by another European
politician on the Jerusalem issue. Visiting European Parliament
President Nicole Fontaine on Tuesday rejected to meet with Husseini
at the Orient House, the unofficial headquarters of the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO) in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The final status of the Holy City, widely acknowledged as one of
the thorniest issues in the entire peace process, is to be decided
in permanent status talks between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Despite diplomatic rows, which also included Israel's mistakenly
putting Luxembourg flag instead of French flag along Jospin's route
into Jerusalem, both countries hope the visit will improve
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Jospin is due to meet Israeli President Ezer Weizman, Prime
Minister Ehud Barak, Foreign Minister David Levy and other senior
officials and is also to inaugurate the new French cultural center
in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Since France has close historic ties with Syria and Lebanon, two
negotiating adversaries of Israel in the Middle East peace process,
Jospin's visit is also considered significant in advancing the
process.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks, which resumed last December
after a 45-month deadlock, hit a snag again only after two rounds
of talks due to differences over Israel's withdrawal from the Golan
Heights, which it occupied from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the flare-up of fightings between Israeli soldiers
and Lebanese guerrillas in South Lebanon and Israel's bombing of
Lebanese infrastructure targets in the past few weeks have dashed
hopes that Israel and Lebanon can reach a peace agreement before
Israel's scheduled withdrawal from South Lebanon in July.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-styled security zone in southern
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Seriously Pursue Policy of Detente: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said on Wednesday his country will work seriously in line
with the policy of detente, dialogue and confidence-building in
foreign relations.
</P>
<P>
On the impact of Iran's 6th parliamentary election on the
country's foreign policy, Kharrazi said Iran has given priority to
cooperation with neighboring states and regional countries and will
proceed with strengthening a sense of brotherhood and solidarity in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The final results of last Friday's election have not come out
yet, but it is already known that reformists will get an absolute
majority in the expanded 290-seat parliament, which will be a great
push for President Mohammed Khatami's reform policies.
</P>
<P>
"We will see a major change in Iran's relations with regional
nations and the entire world," Kharrazi was quoted by the Islamic
Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the election sent a message to other countries
especially the Western states that only making positive statements
are not enough and words should come in conjunction with actions.
</P>
<P>
"Now the question is why certain Western states are working to
pass resolutions on human rights against Iran or why they support
the terrorist groups working against Iran," he said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to statements made by some Western states including that
of the U.S. about Iran, he said, "We expect practical steps to be
taken by them. No doubt any positive action taken by other
countries would receive positive response from Iran."
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said the U.S. has obstructed the construction of oil
and gas pipelines through Iranian territories despite the economic
justifications provided by the European and even U.S. oil firms
that setting up the pipelines through Iran is very economical.
</P>
<P>
Although it (the U.S.) wants to export grains to Iran, it has
imposed sanctions on Iranian goods, particularly Iranian carpet,
pistachios and caviar, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the U.S. severed diplomatic relations in 1980 following
the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran by radical students in
the heyday of the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
In the past months, some U.S. officials have expressed their
willingness to have direct talks with Iran, but Tehran insists that
the U.S. must change its hostile policies and take practical steps
in improving relations.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts say the Iranian reformers' control of the new
parliament may help the two countries in thawing ties.
</P>
<P>
The time has now come for Iran and the other peace-loving
nations to work to promote the common goal of humanity which is
social justice, peace and mutual respect, Kharrazi said.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. antidrug policy

Colombia his country is the largest drug consuming country in the

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Warns Lawmakers Against Incautious Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan emphatically cautioned lawmakers Wednesday
against spending projected federal budget surpluses that he said
may not materialize.
</P>
<P>
"I would submit that irrevocable or almost irrevocable programs
that are put in place now strike me as risking the possibility
that we may be wrong on this surplus," said Greenspan. "And all I
say, all I'm asking in effect, is just to delay for a while until
we have a better grip on what the true balance in the federal
government accounts is."
</P>
<P>
Greenspan made the remarks in an appearance before the Senate
Banking Committee to deliver the Fed's semiannual economic report
to Congress. He gave similar testimony in the House last week.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan also repeated sentiments Wednesday that put financial
markets on notice last week to expect further interest rate
increases if the economy continues to grow at a rapid clip.
</P>
<P>
Although the economy remains strong, and inflation is still
largely at bay, Greenspan said tight labor markets and a continued
consumer spending boom present potential price pressures too great
to ignore.
</P>
<P>
Many private economists are looking for at least two more
quarter-point rate increases from the central bank's next meetings
in March and May.
</P>
<P>
Since June, the Fed has pushed up its target for the federal
funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other, to 5.75
percent in four quarter-point moves, the last one occurring on
February 2.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said the reasons behind recent "tax surprises" that
have overstuffed government coffers during the economic boom in
recent years are not entirely understood by economists yet.
Therefore, it is difficult to predict whether they will persist.
</P>
<P>
For that reason, he said he believes using surpluses to pay
down the national debt is the best thing lawmakers can do for now.
</P>
<P>
Until surplus projections are more certain, Greenspan said, "I'
ve argued that we should allow the surpluses run and... reduce the
debt outstanding."
</P>
<P>
However, if political pressures on lawmakers to use surpluses
are too great, the Fed chairman said, he would prefer a tax cut
over new spending programs.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton's final budget projects that the 3.7-
trillion-U.S.-dollar publicly held portion of the 5.7-trillion-
dollar national debt could be eliminated by 2013, making the
government free of debt to the public for the first time since
1835.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has also proposed extensive new government programs,
however, including an expansion of Medicare to include
prescription drug coverage. Republicans, meanwhile, are pushing
for large tax cuts.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Hails New Guinea-Bissau President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Wednesday extended a welcome to the February 17 swearing
in of a new president in Guinea-Bissau, calling on all parties in
the West African country to "work closely together" to consolidate
peace.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press here, the president of the
Security Council for the month of February, Arnoldo Listre, said,
"Members of the Council welcomed the swearing in of President
Kumba Yala on February 17 and the return of constitutional and
democratic order to Guinea-Bissau following the holding of free
and fair legislative and presidential elections."
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Council expressed support for the newly
elected Government in Guinea-Bissau and encouraged the new
institutions to develop and implement programs designed to
consolidate peace, national reconciliation and economic
development," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Council encouraged all parties in Guinea-
Bissau to work closely together in a spirit of tolerance to
strengthen democratic values, to protect the rule of law and to
guarantee the protection of human rights," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Yala, 46, was sworn in as the West African country's new
president after he clinched 72 percent of the vote in a runoff
race last month. The new president, a career politician, faces the
daunting task of restoring stability and rebuilding the former
Portuguese colony, which was devastated by an 11-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
The presidential elections were a key step toward reunifying
the country of 1.1 million people after the war, which culminated
in President Joao Bernardo Vieira's ouster last May.
</P>
<P>
Fighting broke out in June 1998 after a breakaway military
faction, which later gained broad support among the population,
rebelled against Vieira's allegedly corruption.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Owe 4.3 Million Dollars in Legal Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Mrs. Clinton still have 4.3 million dollars in legal debts,
fund trustees said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The legal defense fund for Clintons is trying to collect enough
donations to clear the debts when Clinton leaves office next
January, Anthony Essays, the trust's executive director, told a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 6 million dollars have been collected over the last six
years to cover the Clintons' legal fees, which are far in excess
of 10.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to ask Americans to contribute to the trust
in the hopes that the president and first lady can leave the White
House... largely free of the remaining... debt," Essays said.
</P>
<P>
The Clintons incurred the legal fees in connection with various
criminal investigations of their activities, as well as in the
sexual harassment suit against President Clinton by former
Arkansas state employee Paula Jones.

OTTAWA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Commercial traffic into the
United States was slowed Wednesday as 60 Canadian truckers staged
another protest near a busiest border crossing to Houlton, Maine.
</P>
<P>
The truckers were keeping traffic to one lane, preventing other
tractor-trailers from getting by down the highway in Woodstock,
New Brunswick, according to a local press report.

The protest came hours after a two-day blockade ended Tuesday
night at the Nova Scotia-New Brunswikc border. Truckers were
complaining about rising fuel costs and toll highways.
</P>
<P>
Canada Tuesday reported an average gasoline price of 69.7 cents

<HEADLINE> Schroeder: Germany Needs Indian, East European Computer Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder declared Wednesday that he planned to relax Germany's
strict immigration laws and recruit computer experts from abroad
to help Germany maintain growth in the important information
technology industry.
</P>
<P>
"Let's not pretend: training and retraining programs will not
eliminate the lack of experts in the medium term," said Schroeder
in a speech opening the CeBIT computer trade fair in Hanover.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder stressed that it is very necessary to invite short-
term information technology (IT) experts to Germany. The
chancellor means here experts from India and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said in the advance text of his speech made
available to reporters.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said that Germany must ensure its boom in the
crucial IT sector, but how can people accomplish it? For the small
and medium-sized German companies it is now very difficult to find
qualified information technology specialists in the German labor
market.
</P>
<P>
After the Second World War, Germany took in large numbers of
the unskilled Gastarbeiter (guest workers) in the 1950s and 1960s.
Therefore, it had to carry out the strict policy of blocking
immigration.
</P>
<P>
At present, there is an 11 percent unemployment in Germany and
the main opposition Christian Democrats have been against the new
immigration policy for a long time: "Germany is not a country for
immigration."
</P>
<P>
But the IT-specialists are too important for Germany.
Therefore, the question must be solved as soon as possible.
Germany wants to create a limited "Green Card" system which would
allow computer experts to remain in Germany for nearly six years.
On the basis of the newly revised German nationality law,
foreigners can apply for German citizenship after living in the
country for eight years.
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Schroeder said with humor, "I am ready to give a
card like the Green Card in the United States. Here it will be
called the 'Red-Green' card." As each German political party has a
traditional color, the Social Democrats (SPD) of Schroeder is red
and the party formed a coalition with the Green Party after
winning the election on September 27, 1998 and therefore is called
"Red-Green Coalition."

<HEADLINE> Narcotics Control Board Issues Annual Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Cannabis is North
America's most widely-used illicit drug, but cocaine and stimulant
use is increasing, the report of the International Narcotics
Control Board (INCB) for 1999 said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Canada now face major problems with the
indoor growing of cannabis, says the United Nations' principle
drug-control body.
</P>
<P>
Indoor grown cannabis with a high tetrahydrocannabinol(THC)
content has become increasingly popular in western Canada and
parts of the United States, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The Board expressed concern that both cannabis seeds and
paraphernalia for growing potent varieties of the drug indoors are
being sold on Internet Web sites -- located primarily on servers
in Canada. "There is an urgent need to counter the spread of such
cultivation,' it says.
</P>
<P>
Mexico is still a key supplier of cannabis as well as a major
transit point for cocaine en route to the United States, the
report says. But Mexico has boosted its drug control efforts and
drug trafficking groups may be shifting their operations to other
Latin American countries, as well as the Caribbean, the Board
suggests.
</P>
<P>
The United States continues to be the world's biggest user of
methylphenidate (the stimulant contained in Ritalin, which is used
to treat Attention Deficit Disorder). How much methylpenidate is
abused in the United States is unknown, but the Board notes that
tablets of the drug are being crushed and snorted or, to a lesser
extent, injected.
</P>
<P>
In Canada, a combination of pentazocine and methylphenidate,
commonly known as "poor-man's heroin", is being injected,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report calls for certain controlled drugs, including
opioids like morphine, to be made more available for legitimate
medical purposes, including the easing of excessive pain and
suffering.
</P>
<P>
It recommends that opioid manufacturers increase their
availability in the developing world, subject to monitoring by the
Board, the World Health Organization and the U.N.international
Drug Control Program.
</P>
<P>
The report also highlights developments in drug control and
production throughout the world.

<HEADLINE> Britain Calls for U.S. Help in N. Ireland Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
However, both Mandelson and former U.S. Senator George Mitchell,
who mediated the landmark Good Friday Accords in 1998, ruled out
Mitchell's return to direct mediation.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson said that the Clinton administration has helped a lot
in pushing the Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I hope very much that they continue to do so and certainly in
my discussions ... I will make clear our desire that the president
and his administration should continue to help us in any way they
can," Mandelson told reporters at the British embassy in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
"For the time being my own judgment -- and this is a
provisional judgment on my part -- is that the two governments
need together to provide the facilities, the opportunity, for
local people, local parties and politicians, to come together to
mend their disagreement," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ireland's RTE radio quoted Mitchell as saying, "I simply have
to devote some time to my family and my business. I have to work
to earn a living."
</P>
<P>
Mandelson was expected to meet U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and President Clinton's National Security
Advisor Samuel Berger.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson also urged all the parties to stop sulking and name-
calling and return to the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"I want to hear those words from each of the political parties
who are linked to the paramilitary organizations, but better still,
and I think indispensably, I want to hear it from the IRA," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"They have got to say that the war is over and better still to
show in their actions that the war is behind us," he added.
</P>
<P>
The British government suspended the self-rule coalition
government in Northern Ireland after the IRA refused to disarm
itself. The negotiations on disarmament ran into an impasse after
the IRA withdrew from the talks earlier this month.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Nears Agreement on Sending Peace-Keepers to DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Wednesday afternoon began another round of meeting behind
closed doors to discuss the current situation in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) while African nations are lobbying to get
thousands of U.N. peace-keepers into the central African country
to save the peace process in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, following the one which lasted into Tuesday night,
came as the 15-nation body is likely to vote this week on the
draft resolution which intends to send 500 military observers and
more than 5,000 peace-keepers into the African country.
</P>
<P>
Security Council members neared agreement on sending military
observers to Congo but were still negotiating an arms embargo on
rebel groups and measures to protect civilians.
</P>
<P>
"I think we are close to an agreement, very close to an
agreement," the president of the Security Council for the month of
February, Arnoldo Listre, told reporters after the Council meeting
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Listre, the Argentine permanent representative to the United
Nations, said that the Council would likely vote Wednesday
although diplomats cautioned that a vote could be delayed until
later in the week.
</P>
<P>
Despite a cease-fire agreement signed last summer in Lusaka,
capital of Zambia, by warring parties, repeated violations have
been reported from the country, formerly known as Zaire.
</P>
<P>
As an initial step, the Security Council last August
authorized the deployment of 90 military liaison officers to
countries involved in the conflict: Congo and its backers --
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, and its opponents, Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
However, it took months to get 79 officers in the field, and
many have been barred from key sites, especially in government-
held areas.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council is expected to vote on the long-awaited
draft resolution, which, sponsored by the United States, calls for
military observers to monitor implementation and lay the
groundwork for possible deployment of a much larger U.N. peace-
keeping force, which is called for in the Lusaka Agreement.
</P>
<P>
But there is still uncertainty about when the military
observers will arrive in the DRC. And the Security Council was
very vague about the deployment of peace-keepers, saying in late
January that it intends to consider preparations "at appropriate
time."
</P>
<P>
In a message to a major forum on U.S.-African relations that
opened Thursday in Washington, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
touched upon the DRC issue, saying that the United Nations was
anxiously awaiting the adoption of a Security Council resolution
which would authorize the deployment of the peace-keeping force in
the DRC.
</P>
<P>
But the international community had to understand, Annan
stressed in the message, that this relatively small United Nations
force, with its "very restricted" mandate, would not be able to
guarantee protection of the civilian population.
</P>
<P>
"I stress this point because I do not want people serving
under the United Nations flag, and doing their best to carry out
the mandate given them by the Security Council, to be held
responsible for circumstances beyond their control," he said. "The
Member States of the United Nations must not blame us later for
failing in tasks they neither equipped nor mandated us to perform.

<HEADLINE> Warring Parties Reaffirm Commitment to Ceasefire in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- All parties involved in the
conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) reaffirmed
in a summit here on Wednesday their commitment to the Lusaka
ceasefire agreement signed last July and August.
</P>
<P>
The one-day summit endorsed March 1, 2000 as the new D-day for
 commencement of some of the activities of the ceasefire agreement
and urged the United Nations Security Council to speedily deploy
an appropriate and effective U.N. peacekeeping force in the
war-torn central African country.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique issued at the end of the summit, all the
warring countries and the rebels acknowledged that some violations
of the agreement have occurred.
</P>
<P>
Such violations will be addressed promptly through the
mechanisms established by the agreement, they said, reiterating
their determination for the full and expeditious implementation of
the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The summit expressed concern over the continued difficulties
being experienced by the Joint Military Committee (JMC) set up to
oversee the implementation of the Lusaka agreement and called on
the international community to provide sufficient financial and
logistical support for JMC.
</P>
<P>
The summit, chaired by Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, was
attended by presidents of the DRC, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Uganda,
Rwanda and Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Angolan defense minister representing Angolan president, rebel
leaders Ernest Wamba Dia Wamba and Jean-Pierre Bemba also attended
the summit.
</P>
<P>
Also at the summit were a representative of Secretary General
of the Organization for African Unity Salim Ahmed Salim and a
special representative of U.N. Secretary General Koffi Annan.
</P>
<P>
All the participants signed the communique as the parties
involved in the war or as witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia dispatched their troops to the DRC
to back DRC President Laureng Kabila after the war broke out in
August of 1998 while Uganda and Rwanda sent forces to support the
rebels fighting to topple Kabila.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder warns Bavarian leader will follow Haider </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder has warned his Social Democrats to maintain high
vigilance to sharper rightist populism from Bavaria's arch-
conservative CSU which appears set to follow Austrian right-winger
Joerg Haider, a media report said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said that the Christian Social Union(CSU) would fuel
anti-European Union (EU.) sentiment. It opposed the swift
enlarging of the EU. into East Europe and giving Turkey a chance
for EU. membership, said Schroeder as quoted by the Berliner
Zeitung newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The CSU is a sister party of the CDU and the Bavarian wing of
the CDU which is at present involved in the serious financial
scandal.
</P>
<P>
CSU leader and Bavarian Prime Minister Edmund Stoiber has been
showing his forces with the CDU's decline. Stoiber is now being
considered a possible CDU/CSU candidate to challenge Schroeder in
Germany's 2002 general election.
</P>
<P>
Stoiber will pander to right-wing populist resentments like
Haider - but in a more respectable manner, said Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder criticized also that the CDU/CSU would try to profit
from anti-foreigner sentiment. Because Stoiber has sharply
attacked the EU's boycott of the new Austrian government which
includes ministers from Haider's Freedom Party. And Stoiber has
received the visit of the Austrian Federal President Thomas
Kleistil on February 11, the CSU has condemned the EU. decision at
its Helsinki summit last December to admit Turkey as a candidate
for membership in the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
But the Stoiber's CSU refused Schroeder's charges.

<HEADLINE> France Stages Investigation of Fugitive in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- France has staged a judicial
investigation into the whereabouts of a fugitive former leader of
the Elf-Aquitain oil group in the Philippines, Agence France-
Presse quoted judicial sources as saying on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The judges in charge of the corruption case of Elf, Eva Joly
and Laurence Vichnievsky, have set up a international
investigation committee charged with finding Alfred Sirven, the
former number two of Elf who has fled France for three years.
</P>
<P>
Sirvan, 72, was accused of abuse of public property in the
corruption case involving former foreign minister Roland Dumas in
the early 1990s, which is centered around the kick-backs paid to
Dumas and his mistress in the deal of selling three French
frigates to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The French weekly Paris-Match reported in November that Sirvan
was living in Manilla with his Philippino girlfriend, Vilma
Aguilando Medina.
</P>
<P>
The French authorities discovered later a banking mail between
Paris and Manilla sent by Medina.
</P>
<P>
Sirvan, who was believed to be using a false name in a
Paraguayan passport, had also traveled several times with Medina
over the past three years between Manila and Hong Kong, said
French officials.
</P>
<P>
Described by local media as a man in the darkness, Sirvan
boasted that he knew so much about Elf's scandals that he could "
shake the French republic 20 times.''
</P>
<P>
He and the former executive officer of Elf, Loik Le Floch-
Prigent, have been both indicted by the French authorities.

<HEADLINE> Italy Pledges to Cancel Poor Countries' Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema
said Wednesday that the Italian government is considering
extending the list of 18 countries benefiting from the write-off
of debt of three trillion lire (about 1.5 billion U.S. dollars)
owned to Italy.
</P>
<P>
He underscored his commitment to heightening the awareness of
the problem in other donor countries, to asking the Japanese
presidency of the G-7 to focus on the serious situation of African
countries and raising the debt issue at the Euro-African
Conference scheduled for April in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
On conditions in Mozambique, the premier said Italy has already
canceled a significant part of that country's debt and the
remaining share outstanding is written into the bill now before
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Speaking for an interview later in the day, D'Alema recalled
that Italy was one of the first nations to take action on this
front in wiping out debt totaling 1.5  trillion lire (about 750
million U.S dollars) in the past.

<HEADLINE> More Wireless Portal Users Expected in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. wireless portal users
will grow to nearly 25 million in the next five years, a new
report released Wednesday estimates.
</P>
<P>
The report from the U.S. market research and consulting firm
Strategis Group defines a wireless portal as customized point of
entry through which a wireless subscriber can access Internet
sites and information.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are 2.3 million wireless portal users in the
United States. The number is expected to reach 24.8 million in
2005.
</P>
<P>
The Strategis Group expects that most major wireless carriers
as well as traditional portals will have a wireless portal by the
end of 2000. The initial target audience will be wireless users
with higher than average monthly bills and "business intensive
users," the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Wireless portals will deliver time-sensitive, localized and
customized content to a variety of devices," the report said. "
Given the mobile environment and limited device screen size, a
wireless portal Internet experience will differ markedly from that
of the conventional Internet."
</P>
<P>
The Strategis Group surveyed wireless users regarding their
interest in accessing the Internet via their wireless phone and
found a high level of interest. Approximately 34 percent of
wireless users expressed an interest in a wireless portal service.
In addition, most of the interested users indicated an interest in
receiving advertising via their portals in exchange for discounted
monthly fees, the report said.
</P>
<P>
While carriers are currently charging a premium for the service,
the Strategis Group expects that low-speed wireless Internet
service will eventually be free to subscribers as part of a
bundled, enhanced service plan.

NEW YORK, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Investors favored technology
stocks Wednesday, pushing the Nasdaq index higher. But blue chip
stocks fell.

<P>
At close of the session, the technology heavy Nasdaq composite

companies. Sun Microsystems and 3Com led the rally and Internet
firms such as eBay, Yahoo! and Amazon.com also pushed the index
higher.
</P>
<P>
American Online and Time Warner rose after Merrill Lynch issued
a positive report on the companies. The two stocks had fallen
after announcing their planned merger last month.
</P>
<P>
While purchasing tech shares, investors sold industrial stocks,
dragging the Dow index lower. Aerospace and defense, chemicals,

<HEADLINE> Ecuador's Government Highlights Dollarization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, February 23 (Xinhua) -- One of the main goals of Ecuador
's government is to rapidly and efficiently apply dollarization to
the economic system, General Secretary of the Government
Administration Marcelo Santos said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The official is convinced the National Congress will approve
the draft Fundamental Law for Economic Transformation, also known
as the Trolley Bus Law, presented on February 14 by the
authorities to apply the dollarization to Ecuador's economy.
</P>
<P>
However, he left open the possibility that with the
dollarization program, strong effects would fall upon citizens
during the first 90 days of its application.
</P>
<P>
The government doesn't intend to apply new economic measures
that could imply economic loads for Ecuadorians enduring a monthly
inflation of 14.7 percent, and over 70 percent yearly, said this
official.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador has been facing its worst economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Inflation in the Andean nation of 12 million people topped 60
percent last year, the highest in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The dollarization or the currency changeover was introduced on
Jan. 9 by former President Jamil Mahuad. He was forced down from
power 12 days later after a military-backed uprising by hundreds
of Indians angry at his inability to half Ecuador's economic slide
and curb corruption.
</P>
<P>
President Gustavo Noboa promised to continue the dollarization
plan.

Mexico City, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's government

These South Americans were sent Wednesday morning back to their

The four Argentines came to Mexico as tourists and were

forbidden to return to Mexico for three years, said the official.
</P>
<P>
In Mexico foreigners engaged in anti-government political
activities are immediately ejected.
</P>

These Argentines were detained last February 6 with 750 other

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Arrives in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) Secretary General George Robertson arrived
here later Wednesday for talks with the Greek leadership.
</P>
<P>
During his first-ever visit to Greece as the new NATO chief,
Robertson will meet with Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos,
Prime Minister Costas Simitis, Foreign Minister George Papandreou
and Defense Minister Akis Tsohaztopoulos.
</P>
<P>
Robertson is expected to discuss with the Greek leadership the
situation in the Balkans, and Kosovo in particular, the European
Union's relationship with NATO in the framework of building the
European security and defense identity, and Greek-Turkish
relations.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief is reportedly bringing NATO initiatives for the
creation of confidence-building measures between Greece and Turkey
in the eastern Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Greece will reportedly reiterate its recent position on the
resumption of talks in the framework of NATO and under the
secretary general's sponsorship and the need to implement the 1988
memorandum signed by the then foreign ministers of Greece's
Karolos Papoulias and Turkey's Mesut Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
Greece has rejected the recent Turkish proposal for the
creation of a joint military-diplomatic committee and the adoption
of confidence-building measures in the Aegean on a bilateral level.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Greece's Kathimerini daily
newspaper Wednesday, Robertson did not consider it expedient to
set out a timetable for agreement on the Aegean between the two
countries, in the context of the confidence-building measures.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Greek-Turkish rapprochement being attempted by
Papandreou and his Turkish counterpart, Ismail Cem, as a "long-
term and visionary" one, Robertson stated that he was prepared to
support their effort if required.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Nears Agreement on Sending Peace-keepers to DRC  (Updated with information from Lusaka) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Wednesday afternoon began another round of meeting
behind closed doors to discuss the current situation in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) while African nations are
lobbying to get thousands of U.N. peace-keepers into the central
African country to save the peace process in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, following the one which lasted into Tuesday night,
came as the 15-nation body is likely to vote this week on the
draft resolution which intends to send 500 military observers and
more than 5,000 peace-keepers into the African country.
</P>
<P>
Security Council members neared agreement on sending military
observers to Congo but were still negotiating an arms embargo on
rebel groups and measures to protect civilians.
</P>
<P>
"I think we are close to an agreement, very close to an
agreement," the president of the Security Council for the month of
February, Arnoldo Listre, told reporters after the Council meeting
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Listre, the Argentine permanent representative to the United
Nations, said that the Council would likely vote today although
diplomats cautioned that a vote could be delayed until later in
the week.
</P>
<P>
The Council meeting came after seven African regional leaders
ended one-day special summit in Lusaka, capital of Zambia,
Wednesday and called for the speedy implementation of the cease-
fire agreement in DRC.
</P>
<P>
The leaders from DRC, Namibia, Rwanda, Uganda, Zimbabwe,
Mozambique and Zambia in a joint communique reaffirmed their
strong commitment to the Lusaka cease-fire agreement and
reiterated their determination for its full implementation.
</P>
<P>
Despite a cease-fire agreement signed on July 10 in Lusaka by
warring parties, repeated violations have been reported from the
country, formerly known as Zaire.
</P>
<P>
As an initial step, the Security Council last August
authorized the deployment of 90 military liaison officers to
countries involved in the conflict: Congo and its backers --
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, and its opponents, Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
However, it took months to get 79 officers in the field, and
many have been barred from key sites, especially in government-
held areas.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council is expected to vote on the long-awaited
draft resolution, which, sponsored by the United States, calls for
military observers to monitor implementation and lay the
groundwork for possible deployment of a much larger U.N. peace-
keeping force, which is called for in the Lusaka Agreement.
</P>
<P>
But there is still uncertainty about when the military
observers will arrive in DRC. And the Security Council was very
vague about the deployment of peace-keepers, saying in late
January that it intends to consider preparations "at appropriate
time."
</P>
<P>
In a message to a major forum on U.S.-African relations that
opened Thursday in Washington, U.N. Secretary-General touched upon
the DRC issue, saying that the United Nations was anxiously
awaiting the adoption of a Security Council resolution which would
authorize the deployment of the peace-keeping force in DRC.
</P>
<P>
But the international community had to understand, Annan
stressed in the message, that this relatively small United Nations
force, with its "very restricted" mandate, would not be able to
guarantee protection of the civilian population.
</P>
<P>
"I stress this point because I do not want people serving
under the United Nations flag, and doing their best to carry out
the mandate given them by the Security Council, to be held
responsible for circumstances beyond their control," he said. "The
Member States of the United Nations must not blame us later for
failing in tasks they neither equipped nor mandated us to perform.

<HEADLINE> NATO Plans to Send Additional Forces to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Visiting French Defense Minister Alain Richard and U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen made the announcement at a press
conference following their meeting focusing on the development in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed on the importance of maintaining order in our
sectors while the international community works to expand a police
force. Over the last few days, NATO forces -- NATO-led forces
have shown their determination to quell the violence in Mitrovica,
" Cohen told a joint press conference.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the press conference, Richard indicated that the
French are prepared to put additional forces into Mitrovica, where
the violence occurred.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that NATO commanders "will make an assessment in
terms of exactly how many forces, additional forces are needed
beyond the additional French contribution, what the composition
will be -- light infantry, mechanized -- exactly what is required.
"
</P>
<P>
Asked if the U.S. will send additional force to Kosovo, Cohen
said the decision will be made after the assessment is completed.
</P>
<P>
"We're going to see what the commander requests. Again, we
have quite a contribution made to date. We will see what is
required and await that decision," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
Richard said that "a strategic reserve, had been prepared, and
this shows that the planning for KFOR had been coherent and had
been long-sighted, since now we may have to use part of this
reserve."
</P>
<P>
"So it's simply no more military business to decide whether a
part of this reserve is going to be mobilized for probably a
limited time, but to decide to make the real provisions so that we
take control of the situation there," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We have a component in the strategic reserve, and we are open
to devoting it to this task," Richard said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen told reporters that the reinforcement at this point is in
the French sector only, but not in the American sector in Kosovo,
which was divided into several sectors controlled by forces from
different countries.
</P>
<P>
"We don't anticipate reinforcing Americans in the American
sector, as such, at this point, so this really is a reinforcement
in that region for a short period of time," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen also urged the both Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo not to
resort to violence against the NATO-led peace-keeping force or the
KFOR.
</P>
<P>
"It should be clear to both the Serbs and the Kosovar Albanians
that they will not achieve their goals by opposing KFOR or by
fighting with each other," Cohen told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The secretary also noted that progress has been made in the
past year, but "passions still run high and are likely to run high
for some time."

<HEADLINE> Reunification With Motherland, Only Way Out For Taiwan: Chinese Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Reunification with the
motherland is the only way out for Taiwan, and any other forms
such as the "Two States" doctrine, changing Taiwan's status by
referendum or "Two German states formula" are intolerable, a
senior Chinese diplomat said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
China's White Paper on Taiwan was issued at a time when
separatists in Taiwan stepped up their attempt to separate the
island from mainland China and certain elements in the U.S. made
effort to interfere in the Taiwan issue, Yu Shuning, spokesman of
the Chinese embassy in the United States, told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper, issued by the Taiwan Affairs Office and the
Information Office of the State Council on February 21, showed to
the world the Chinese government's sincerity to seek the
settlement of the Taiwan issue through peaceful means and the
resolution of the Chinese people to reunite the country, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
"The document reaffirmed the Chinese government's basic
principle in settling the Taiwan issue, that is peaceful
reunification and 'One Country, Two Systems," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government has shown great flexibility in the
across-Straits talks within the framework of One China, anything
can be discussed in the coming negotiations," he said. "The talks
will be conducted on an equal footing." But he did not tell when
the talks will be resumed.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman urged the United States to honor its solemn
commitment to the Chinese people on the Taiwan question and stop
interfering in China's internal affairs by refraining from selling
advanced weapons to Taiwan and preventing the Taiwan Security
Enhancement Act from becoming law.
</P>
<P>
Yu Shuning reiterated that the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act,
if adopted and signed into law, will bring about "very serious
consequences" to China-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan issue is left by civil war, China has the right to
settle the issue without foreign interference, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is entirely China's internal affairs, we will not tolerate
foreign interference, including the United States," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Yu Shuning said China is determined to safeguard its
sovereignty and territorial integrity. "China would never
compromise on sovereignty issues," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Appeals for 13.6 Mln Dlrs to Aid 300,000 Flood Victims in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Wednesday issued an inter-agency appeal to address the devastation
caused by recent floods in Mozambique, which is considered to be
the worst in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is appealing for 13.6 million U.S. dollars
in order to provide emergency assistance over the next six months
to some 300,000 people affected by the floods, U.N. officials said
here.
</P>
<P>
Priority areas for assistance include food aid, health,
shelter, water and sanitation and repairs to basic infrastructure,
such as schools, said the officials.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who remains deeply
concerned by the desolation caused by the floods, has called on
the international community for a generous response to this appeal.
</P>
<P>
The Government of Mozambique estimates that up to 50 million U.
S. dollars will be required over time to address the worsening
flood situation. In addition to the response of the United Nations,
the International Federation of Red Cross and other non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) are also providing assistance,
particularly in the shelter sector.
</P>
<P>
Carolyn MaAskie, emergency relief coordinator, said, "It is
imperative to speed up the delivery of assistance to Mozambique at
this critical stage to prevent the loss of more lives, additional
damage to essential infrastructure and the spread of disease."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she highlighted the fact that "this tragedy has hit
Mozambique at a time when it is still on the long road to recovery
from years of conflict."
