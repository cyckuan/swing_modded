   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WITH 102 victories and the home-field advantage in the first round
of the playoffs, the Astros finished the best regular season in
franchise history Sunday, winning yet another game in their
last-hurrah at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   That's 27 of same for these Never-Say-Die-'Stros, if you've lost
count. Still, the year cannot be judged a complete, unadulterated
success. Nope.
</P>
<P>
   Because they couldn't finish the Cubs, too. In short, as lovely
a season as it has been to date, the Astros failed to achieve their
final objective. Revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Almost nobody, including the many new faces in the Houston
clubhouse, remembers what the Cubbies did to them in 1995. But
manager Larry Dierker, then a broadcaster, does. Oh, yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They practically spilled blood to knock us out (of the
playoffs),'' Dierker said. ``I felt like we owed them one today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubbies may be America's lovable losers, its favorite
failures, but the Astros don't readily share these maudlin
sentiments. Nor do they buy into the myth of the Cursed Cubs, even
though the baby bears haven't won a world championship since not
long after the Spanish-American War, or a National League title
since right after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   When a Neifi Perez home run saves your season, or at least
prolongs it for an extra day, how do you claim with a straight face
that the gods of ball hate you? Sorry. It doesn't wash anymore, now
that Harry Caray is ``Holy Cow!''-ing in heaven's press box.
</P>
<P>
   Almost simultaneously with Carl Everett dashing home, scoring
the 11th-inning run for Houston that should have left Chicago for
dead, we were informed of the diminutive Dominican's homer _ No. 9
on the year for Perez _ in the bottom of the ninth for the Rockies
that beat the Giants and saved the Cubbies from immediately
starting another of their traditional winter hibernations.
</P>
<P>
   So two teams that couldn't find a way to hold seven-run leads in
the waning hours of the season come to play tonight in the Friendly
Confines for the opportunity to become fodder for the Braves. The
matchup of two unworthies does, however, give good guy Sammy Sosa,
the large Dominican, a bonus chance to hit four home runs and catch
Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Three autumns ago, when baseball was still trying to overcome
the damage of the Great Strike, the Astros charged into Chi-town
for a season-ending four-game series and landed upside down with a
split, their playoff bid a smoldering ruin. And making the near
miss extra painful was the recollection of how the previous year's
club, the one made to stop playing abruptly in mid-August, was
arguably the deepest in franchise history up to that juncture.
</P>
<P>
   Those 66-49 Astros trailed Cincinnati by half a game. There they
stayed, and the near-ruinous financial fallout forced Drayton
McLane Jr. to unsentimentally dump the salaries of mainstays Ken
Caminiti and Steve Finley over the lengthy offseason. It also
almost forced him to sell the Astros down the river, like all the
way to Northern Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after much more of his good money followed bad into the
bottomless pit that baseball can be in small-market land, McLane
may finally be a teeny bit glad he stayed on. His current team,
despite some herky-jerky efforts of late, is a fully mature bear.
</P>
<P>
   But guess who's in the way beginning Tuesday? John Moores'
Padres. Featuring, among others, Cammy and Finley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I'm happy for them,'' Jeff Bagwell said, ``but I'm more
happy for us.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Braves put the free-falling Mets out of their misery
Sunday, the Astros knew they could focus their undivided attention
on San Diego. Nonetheless, they needed this punctuation mark of a
victory, 4-3, to remind them of their own merits. The Astros, only
recently the hottest team in either league, had come to drop seven
of 12 games. If you believe in the karma of momentum _ and most of
us do _ theirs had to be reversed in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take a lot of pride in winning like we did today,''
Dierker said. ``We didn't want to just hand the Cubs the wild card,
not after what they did to us (in '95). It was a really good way to
get in a playoff frame of mind. We took two of three from a team
that needed to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs led the finale 3-1 until the bottom of the eighth. Two
registered after Craig Biggio, the headiest of Astros, made an
error while attempting to turn a double play _ with two out.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the Astros rallied for a pair in the eighth, with
Bagwell scoring the tying run from first on a single. Then, in
overtime, Richard Hidalgo produced the winning RBI with a sacrifice
fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what planet I was on,'' Biggio said, grimacing at
a mention of his miscue. ``I was out of it. Nobody felt better than
I did when we came back.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, regarding the Chicagos, there would be no payback. It is
safe to assume, however, they will do themselves in sooner or
later. Whammy or no whammy, they are the Cubs.

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Doak Walker, whose grace and magnetism made him an enduring sports
hero 50 years after he won the Heisman Trophy, died Sunday of
complications from the paralysis he suffered in a skiing accident
in January. Walker was 71.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walker, still considered by many the greatest all-around
football player ever for his career at SMU and with the Detroit
Lions, was a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, a three-time
All-American and the namesake for the Doak Walker Award given
annually to college football's top running back.
</P>
<P>
   Walker died in Routt Memorial Hospital in Steamboat Springs,
Colo., the ski resort where he had lived for almost 30 years.
Walker was injured Jan. 30 on a ski slope that had been one of his
favorites and on the sort of long, sweeping turn that had been his
preference. He was thrown for roughly 25 feet, bruising his brain
stem and leaving him paralyzed from the neck down.
</P>
<P>
   He had been moved to an intensive care unit Sept. 20 and died
Sunday shortly after 1 p.m., having spent the morning with his
wife, the former Skeeter Werner. He is also survived by four
children and four grandchildren. Funeral and memorial arrangements
are pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had been fighting like he always had, but he had the
spirit, those bright eyes,'' Yale Lary, a friend and former Lions
teammate of Walker, said Sunday. ``Everybody is so devastated, but
bless his heart, I guess he's probably better off.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing around the corner of his childhood home, Walker shot to
legendary status at SMU, where he became the nation's first
post-World War II sports hero. His small stature, wholesome image
and striking good looks made him a natural for magazine covers and
mandatory school book reports.
</P>
<P>
   A breathtaking athlete who excelled at every aspect of football
as well as almost every other sport he touched at SMU from 1945 to
his three All-American seasons in 1946-49, Walker was idealized for
his manner as much as his ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did so many things right for people trying to emulate
him,'' former Rice All-American Dicky Maegle said. ``All of us.
We'd play in the sandlot and say, `Who are you? I'm Doak Walker.'
Everybody wanted to be Doak Walker.''
</P>
<P>
   He was so popular a player, SMU had to move its games from Ownby
Stadium to the Cotton Bowl, then expand the Cotton Bowl _ ``The
house that Doak built'' _ from 48,000 to 72,000 for the remaining
two years of his career.
</P>
<P>
   At SMU and throughout his NFL career, Walker played running
back, wide receiver, quarterback and defensive back. He also punted
and returned punts and kickoffs. He also played basketball and
baseball at SMU.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy was gifted,'' said Dick Davis, Walker's lifelong
friend and SMU teammate. ``He could do anything. He had grace,
balance, strength, speed. He could do anything, and he excelled in
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he played at just 5-10, 175 pounds, there were doubts
about Walker's professional potential, especially given the extent
of his legend. But with the Lions, he was an All-Pro in four of his
six seasons. And with his longtime friend, Highland Park High
School teammate and collegiate rival Bobby Layne, he helped lead
the Lions to two NFL titles.
</P>
<P>
   In the NFL, Walker ran for 1,520 yards, averaging 4.9 yards per
carry; caught 152 passes for 2,359 yards and 21 touchdowns; and
averaged 39.1 yards on punts, 15.8 yards on punt returns and 25.5
yards on kickoff returns. But more than anything, he scored,
especially with games on the line. Walker retired with 534 points
on 34 touchdowns, 183 extra points and 49 field goals, ending his
short pro career with the third-most points in NFL history to that
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always Doak that came through,'' Lary said. ``It was
that way at SMU, and he did the same thing at Detroit when we won
the championships. He came through in the clutch. He just did it.
He wasn't the fastest guy. He just won. That's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Layne once called Walker ``the greatest clutch player I ever
saw.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker retired in 1955 to enter business in Denver, coached
briefly with the Broncos, then moved to Steamboat Springs, where he
never regretted cutting his career short.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved football,'' Walker once said. ``I loved it when I was
a little kid; I loved it when I was a young man playing it. And I
didn't retire in 1955 because I had lost the desire. But I had
achieved just about everything that I felt that I could. I had been
All-Pro; I had played on NFL championship teams. I had been treated
well, paid well by the standards of the day and accumulated a
lifetime of memories. Football was good to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I always knew it was something you couldn't do forever. I
didn't want to be one of those guys who stayed a year too long. So
I got out with both my knees, all my teeth and most of my
faculties.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, he moved to Steamboat Springs, where he could ski,
golf, hunt, fish and ride horses all year, and where he again
became the sort of legend he was decades earlier for his humility
and easy charm. He received thousands of cards, letters and faxes
since the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doak touched people like no one else did,'' said Rod Hanna, a
longtime friend of Walker. ``Doak had a magical quality about him.
Wherever he went, he touched people. Throughout his life that was
the case. You saw the outpouring from around the world from people
that one way or another he touched. He had magnetism about him. He
was so unassuming, approachable. He had a great sense of humor, a
great wit. And that endured.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Lary, ``As a personal friend and as an individual, there
was never a nicer, more sincere guy than him. I have never known a
person any better than he.''
</P>
<P>
   And though Walker never seemed impressed by his own
accomplishments _ for many years his Heisman Trophy sat on a coat
rack in his wife's ski shop _ he did consider himself greatly
fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't explain it. I don't know how it all happened,'' Walker
once said. ``I was raised by wonderful people that gave me a set of
values that have served me all my life. Other than that, I can only
say that I was in exactly the right place at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have led a blessed life. I don't know how anyone could be
more blessed.''

 By DANNY ROBBINS  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
ST. LOUIS _ When it was over, many in the crowd of 46,110 at Busch
Stadium stayed in their seats to see Mark McGwire receive yet
another honor, the St. Louis Award.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Established in 1932, the award is given annually to the
individual who has made the most outstanding contribution or has
brought the greatest distinction to the community during the past
year. It is geared toward authors, philanthropists and doctors, not
the modern athlete.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday, a hot, muggy day on the riverfront, Mark Gwire of
the St. Louis Cardinals _ a St. Louisan barely a year and one who
lives in the community for work purposes only _ showed once again
how he has woven his place into the fabric of a city. Yes, there
have been charitable good works. But he also hits the ball an awful
long way.
</P>
<P>
   On the final day of the regular season, McGwire ended his
magical summer by hitting his 69th and 70th home runs, likely
making him the owner of baseball's most compelling record.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa's Chicago Cubs have a one-game playoff tonight with
the San Francisco Giants in Chicago for the final National League
spot in postseason competition, a game that will be included in the
regular-season statistics. But only a miracle will give the
home-run crown to Sosa, who has been holding for two days at 66.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's home runs Sunday were his fourth and fifth since Sosa
briefly assumed the lead with his 66th on Friday night in the
Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Making the day even more telling was the way McGwire got No. 70
_ on the first pitch of what would be his last at-bat of the
season. With two out and two on in the seventh inning, he hit a
fastball off the Montreal Expos' Carl Pavano into a low-level
private box just beyond the wall in the left-field corner.
</P>
<P>
   The three-run homer landed just above the spot where McGwire
deposited No. 62, the home run that broke Roger Maris' 37-year-old
single-season record Sept. 8. No. 70 also, if anyone was paying
attention, wound up giving the Cardinals a 6-3 victory over the
Expos.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis catcher Tom Lampkin was asked if the day could have
been scripted any better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if there'd been extra innings,'' he said. ``That would
be the only thing that could top it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even McGwire was in awe of what he had accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it'll be talked about or understood for a
while,'' he said. ``I mean, it's just I mean, it's unheard of for
somebody to hit 70 home runs. I'm like in awe of myself right now.
You put your mind to something, it'll happen. But I think I'll have
to sit down and think about what I've done all year and what I've
really accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   In what will be remembered as a footnote to history, McGwire's
final home run turned up in the hands of Philip Ozersky, a resident
of suburban Olivette. Ozersky, 26, works on a genetics-related
project at St. Louis' Washington University. As of late Sunday
afternoon, he wasn't sure what he was going to do with the ball,
which could be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a pretty big baseball fan,'' he said, ``so I'd like it to
end up in the Hall of Fame. You hear people on the radio saying,
`If I caught No. 62, I'd sell it,' so I'm going to give it some
thought. But I'd definitely like to shake Mark McGwire's hand and
have the ball end up in the Hall of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who hit his 67th and 68th homers Saturday, started
Sunday with a single, a soft liner to center, off Expos starter
Mike Thurman, a righthander who was making only his 15th
major-league start and never had faced the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Facing Thurman again in the third, McGwire hit a 1-1 breaking
ball into the low-level seats in left field for home run No. 69. He
acknowledged the fans' long standing ovation with a second curtain
call.
</P>
<P>
   After walking on four pitches from Thurman in the fifth _ the
result drawing the expected boos _ McGwire faced Pavano in the
seventh with two out and two on in a 3-3 game. One pitch later it
was 6-3, more pandemonium.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire said he didn't go to the plate thinking it would be his
last at-bat of the season. As for why he went for the first pitch,
his strategy was simple _ because, he said, he had seen rookie J.D.
Drew, the Cardinals' No. 2 hitter, do it, the result being a single
to right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never faced him (Pavano) before,'' McGwire said. ``I had
no idea how his ball moves. J.D. swung at the first pitch, so I
figured, hey . It was a fastball, and I got a lot of top hand on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   His emotions, he said, were similar to those he felt when he hit
the home run that broke Maris' record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaking hands with the players on the Expos (as he rounded the
bases), it just felt great,'' he said. ``What can I say? I'm
speechless, really.''
</P>
<P>
   As Busch Stadium erupted for the second time, the Fan of the
Hour, Ozersky, won a relatively painless battle for the ball in his
private box, which seats about 100.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the ball) hit the back wall and bounced to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Expos manager Felipe Alou said he instructed his pitchers not to
pitch around McGwire unless absolutely necessary ``because I just
didn't want to tamper with history.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou was among those shaking their heads over the five home runs
McGwire hit in the weekend series with the Expos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said this morning, `Thank God this one (series) is over,
because he'll probably hit 80 home runs,''' Alou said. ``Now he'll
go play golf and really hit those (drives).''
</P>
<P>
   For McGwire, the new spirit of St. Louis, finding the right
words often was difficult, no matter how many times the same
questions were asked in slightly different ways.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood of besting Sosa, he said, does not mean much, if
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Sammy and I were tied at 70, I'd still be proud,'' he said.
``It has been one hell of a ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what hitting 70 home runs stands for, he said: ``It stands
for a lot. I know how grueling it is to do what I've done this
year. Will it (his record) be broken someday? Could be. Will I be
alive? Possibly. If I'm still playing, I'll be there. If I'm not
playing, I'll definitely be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the player who passes McGwire's milestone might be
named Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   As Lampkin put it: ``I'm not good at predicting, but maybe the
record will last about 4{ months, until he gets to spring
training.''

 By DANNY ROBBINS  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
ST. LOUIS _ The Cardinals' Mark McGwire has found that hitting 70
home runs in a season means just about every piece of you has
historic significance.
<TEXT>
<P>
   McGwire gave away the shoes and batting gloves he wore when he
hit his 69th and 70th home runs of the season Sunday. He said his
bat will go to the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I don't own a piece of anything I wore in the
game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also has found that hitting 70 home runs in a season can be
draining. That's why the man himself soon will go to his home in
Southern California, where he can decompress.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of his 70th homer, McGwire talked of a season
fraught with pressure, the last two months in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am absolutely exhausted,'' he said. ``I don't think you can
use your mind any more (than he has) playing the game of baseball.
I amazed myself that I stayed in such a tunnel. The expectations.
Just about everybody in the nation watching. I just proved I can
overcome anything I want to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was expected to chase Roger Maris' record of 61 home
runs in a season. That he broke the record _ and then some _ is
indeed a story of a man who stayed focused amid intense scrutiny,
occasional controversy (remember andro?) and the burden of
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I set my sights in spring training on accomplishing
something,'' he said, ``and I accomplished it. I know what I've
gone through mentally, the mental grind. Off the top of my head
right now, the only goal I have is to get back to the playoffs and
World Series again.''
</P>
<P>
   Such was the theme of much of what McGwire said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his battle with Chicago's Sammy Sosa for the
home-run title, McGwire said: ``It has been nerve-wracking, but I'm
proud to be doing what I've been doing with Sammy Sosa.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, 35, also described his achievement in terms of the ups
and downs in his career, which included lean times in Oakland early
this decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the perfect example of a player who has dealt with so much
adversity,'' he said. ``Injuries. Times when I've played terrible.
But I climbed that mountain and reached the peak.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire said his plans include returning to his home in
California's Orange County and laying low. Maybe some endorsements.
If he can help it, no personal appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get caught up in that stuff,'' he said, ``the first thing
you know, it's spring training.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his major objectives is driving, for the first time, the
vintage Corvette he received from the Cardinals when he hit his
62nd home run Sept. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still in my garage at home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also plans to spend some time at the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a tan,'' he said with a laugh. ``All white. It'll
be like, `Who's this guy from the East Coast?''''

   LOS ANGELES _ USC losing handily to Florida State isn't exactly
stunning news, but if there was a revealing moment Saturday, it
might have come afterward when coach Paul Hackett discussed
freshman quarterback Carson Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's going to play half a game, he needs to get more
practice time for a young player,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, Hackett says only that Palmer will receive less snaps
in practice than starter Mike Van Raaphorst, so maybe this is the
first subtle signal that the freshman is inching closer to becoming
a starter. That could be one way to shake the Trojans out of their
offensive malaise. Otherwise, USC could be reduced to focusing on
some other problems that might lack solutions. Like the offensive
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see how we would perform in a game like this,''
offensive line coach Steve Greatwood said.
</P>
<P>
   If this were the first midterm, the line flunked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wilted under the pressure,'' Greatwood said. ``It wasn't
any one guy. We've just got to believe in our techniques. Some of
the guys kind of forgot and reverted back to old techniques.''
</P>
<P>
   USC (3-1) will probably not face another defense as quick and
athletic as Florida State's, but that's hardly an inspiring motto
for the line, which has struggled all season.
</P>
<P>
   Another downfall has been penalties and game management. The
Trojans have had 44 penalties in four games, which projects to 132
over the course of the season. Last year's 6-5 squad, which was
known for its mental miscues, had 102.
</P>
<P>
   ``The penalties continue to plague us,'' said Hackett, in an
understatement.
</P>
<P>
   As for game management, the Trojans called timeout in the third
quarter for having 12 men on the field, then came back from the
break and committed a false-start penalty.
</P>
<P>
   A delay of game penalty early in the fourth quarter was even
worse. With a third-and-1 at the Trojans 39, USC wanted to surprise
the Seminoles with a long pass to R. Jay Soward. As the coaches
explained this to Palmer on the sideline, the 25-second clock
blissfully ticked away. Palmer was not released to the huddle until
15 seconds were left. No one told Palmer to call timeout and the
Trojans were unable to get the play off in time.
</P>
<P>
   These are the type of errors that are far more troublesome than
being run over by a superior Florida State team.
</P>
<P>
   It might sound dramatic, but suddenly, after building up good
will with three straight victories, USC is already at a crossroads
at Week 5. If USC doesn't regroup and defeat Arizona State this
week, things could quickly deteriorate much as in the previous two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important is how we bounce back,'' offensive lineman
Travis Claridge said. ``If we don't bounce back, we're in a whole
lot of hurt. We've got to take that out on Arizona State.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the older players were wondering how the Trojans
would respond to their first dose of adversity in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were on a great roll. A lot of new guys haven't experienced
a loss,'' tailback Chad Morton said. ``This is one that hurts. It
seems like we haven't lost in a very long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Morton, who re-strained his back against Florida State,
is listed as possible for this week's game against Arizona
State.... Hackett said the Trojans might practice the shotgun
formation this week, to help alleviate pressure on the
quarterbacks.... USC's 23 yards passing turned out to be its fewest
since the 1979 Rose Bowl against Michigan, when the Trojans had 23
yards. Trojans quarterbacks completed three passes, the fewest
since 1981 against Cal.

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Fifty years after Doak Walker won the Heisman Trophy, Ricky
Williams of Texas has Walker's picture on his locker.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The person he was is the person that I want to be,'' said
Williams, the nation's leading rusher and scorer last season.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years earlier, Dicky Maegle felt the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, 71, died Sunday in Steamboat Springs, Colo., of
complications from a skiing accident that had left him paralyzed
Jan. 30.
</P>
<P>
   But Maegle can remember the feeling of finding a hero, as so
many of his generation had, as if it was as new a discovery for him
as it is for Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Maegle would become one of the greatest Rice running backs ever,
an All-American in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1947, the first of Walker's three All-America seasons,
Maegle had been swept up in the stories of SMU's legendary back and
made a pilgrimage to find his hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be everything Doak Walker was,'' Maegle said. ``I
admired him because of all the things he could do _ pass, run,
punt, kick. He was an absolute winner on the field and off the
field. He led an exemplary life for young people like me.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to see him play the first time, I hitchhiked to
Austin from Taylor. I wanted to see him play so bad. I didn't have
any money to go into the stadium, but they told me Boy Scouts could
get into the stadium free. I wasn't a Boy Scout, but I borrowed a
Boy Scout uniform to see him play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He parted his hair off-center, neatly combed. He looked like a
movie star. He was a handsome guy, small in stature and the first
one to wear low-cut shoes. He was also first with that new Riddell
headgear. He looked like a movie star in motion. And he looked so
great in his uniform, like it was made just for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There I am in total awe; second play of the game, he ran 67
yards for a touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Right then, Maegle knew what he wanted to be.
</P>
<P>
   And though Maegle was one of the few with the talent to live
that dream, Walker was a magazine-cover ideal and representative
for postwar America. His biography, Doak Walker: Three-time
All-American became mandatory reading. Long before his induction to
the Pro Football or College Football halls of fame, Walker was a
football hero in the most idealized sense of the term, a Heisman
Trophy winner, with the homecoming queen on his arm on the cover of
Collier's magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody needs somebody to idolize,'' Maegle said. ``For all
of us then, it was Doak Walker.''
</P>
<P>
   Decades later, Williams reacted the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really has touched my life,'' Williams said. ``He was Mr.
All-American, what every kid wants to grow up and be. But that
seemed not to affect him at all. He just enjoyed life.''
</P>
<P>
   Those he enjoyed it with speak often about Walker's ability to
touch people, about a magnetism in his combination of great
accomplishment and unassuming nature that lived up to the image
described and celebrated long before.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the joys of my life,'' said sportscaster Verne
Lundquist, one of Walker's closest friends for 24 years. ``I was an
8-year-old, in blue jeans, tattered T-shirt, sneakers, playing
tackle football in a vacant lot. I remember growing up pretending
to be Doak Walker. My best friend and I would argue who would get
to be Doak. That was the image I had of Doak. If you magnify it
through the imagination of an 8-year-old in the '40s, that's what
Doak meant to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up idolizing the guy. When I met him (in 1974), I was
just overwhelmed to see he was exactly the kind of man I hoped he'd
be. He was unassuming, smiled all the time. It was amazing. He
wasn't up on a pedestal. Doak was a very real man. He was just what
you'd hoped he would be. What a man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm around athletes all the time. If I ever doubted what made
him a champion I've never seen it exemplified the way it was with
Doak. He just kept those bright eyes, smiling, joking. He was going
through hell, but he'd never let anyone else know it. He was one of
a kind.''

THIS LEAF HAS FALLEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Say this about Ryan Leaf; he meant well.
</P>
<P>
   Before setting sail on his maiden NFL voyage, the Chargers
quarterback pledged to give $100 to the Make-A-Wish Foundation for
every touchdown pass he threw. Considering the cocky quarterback
had completed 33 passes for scores his third and final season at
Washington State, the charity had every reason to believe it'd be
on the receiving end of a nice chunk of change.
</P>
<P>
   With one quarter of the season gone it has become painfully
obvious that Leaf got his signals crossed. The major beneficiaries
of his charity thus far have been drooling secondaries, ot dying
children.
</P>
<P>
   If it's not some addled altruistic streak, how else to explain
the fact Leaf has thrown eight interceptions and only one touchdown
in four games?
</P>
<P>
   The New York Giants came into Leaf's crib on Sunday and tagged
him for four interceptions, three of which led to touchdowns. It
was lost on no one, least of all Leaf, that those 21 points loomed
large in the Chargers' 34-16 loss in front of a Qualcomm Stadium
crowd of 55,672.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two weeks Leaf has completed 33 percent of his
passes (16 of 49) for an average of 12 yards. Sunday, in
two-and-a-half quarters against the second-worst pass defense in
the league, he completed 15 of 34 passes for 193 yards (the Giants
carried his stolen balls another 90 yards).
</P>
<P>
   By the time Chargers coach Kevin Gilbride mercifully applied the
hook, the usually hospitable Chargers fans were booing Leaf
lustily. It was an abominable afternoon all around for Leaf, coming
as it did on the heels of his calamity in Kansas City, where he
completed two passes to Chiefs and one to a Charger in a 23-7
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, autumn is not a good time to be a Leaf. He hasn't
thrown a touchdown pass since the third quarter of San Diego's
season opener against Buffalo, a streak of futility that has
consumed 12 quarters and 185 minutes, 38 seconds (and ticking).
</P>
<P>
   To add insult to ineptitude, Leaf's replacement Craig Whelihan
needed only four downs to launch a missile into the end zone,
connecting with Charlie Jones on a 41-yard play that cut the
Chargers' deficit to 28-16 with 5:28 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Another birthday gift like this one and Chargers Chairman of the
Board Alex Spanos, who turned 75 Sunday, may head straight for the
Returns department. It's safe to say the Chargers didn't trade
three draft picks and two players to Arizona for the right to draft
at No.2 overall a young man who in two weeks has led his team to as
many losses as he did the Cougars of Washington State all of last
season.
</P>
<P>
   No one has to tell the 22-year-old that if his stock plummets
any farther, he'll be known as Ruble Leaf.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Leaf had been combative after his fall from grace in
Kansas City, cursing out a cameraman and later cussing out a local
reporter who dared to ask him about it, he was a study in
contrition Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He addressed reporters from a lectern but he might as well have
been on a psychoanalyst's couch. It wasn't an interview session so
much as a self-conscious stab at stream of consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' he began, cutting off any awkward opening questions at
the pass, ``it kinda feels like someone ripped my heart out of me.
I want to succeed so much. But then I go out and really lose the
game for us... It's sad to see everybody else on the field work so
hard and then have a rookie quarterback come in and blow it like
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Gilbride did the right thing by taking me out of the
game,'' he added. ``I certainly wasn't helping us win the football
game. Based on my performance this year, there's no reason for me
to be the starting quarterback. You have to look at yourself after
two games like this and kinda wonder if you're able to play at this
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaf had breezily blown reporters off three days earlier,
explaining that he had to get home to a new cook he had just hired.
How was anybody to know her specialty was crow?
</P>
<P>
   Leaf is about the last athlete you'd expect to be self-abasing.
Humble, he is not.
</P>
<P>
   So to listen to him trash himself and his performance was
startling, to say the least. It was like showing up at the White
House briefing room and hearing President Clinton wax earnestly
about his monogamy.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Ryan has turned over a new Leaf. That might not be an
altogether good thing. His brashness, if not exactly part of his
charm, is an unmitigating factor in his success.
</P>
<P>
   You can't achieve if you don't believe. Until this month, Leaf's
mind brimmed with certainty. He blithely thought limitations were
for other people. Having courted only courted success, he had no
idea what failure looked like.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf is big on visualization. The moment he starts to picture
himself without the cape and the ``S'' on his chest, it's only a
matter of time before the Chargers collectively feel naked. Thus,
their mission this week: Saving General Ryan. &QL;

PARK PLEASED WITH FAST FINISH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Chan Ho Park said after Sunday's 2-1 victory over
the Milwaukee Brewers that he doesn't care about who the Dodgers'
No.1 pitcher is next season.
</P>
<P>
   Amid clubhouse speculation that the Dodgers must make offseason
bids for free agents Kevin Brown or Randy Johnson to stabilize
their young staff, Park said the best part of his career-high 15
victories this season is the four that came in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I don't care about that other stuff,'' said Park,
who allowed eight hits and one run in six innings. ``For myself and
the team, I am happiest with the way I pitched at the end of the
season. That shows that my stamina has improved and that I can give
this team 200 innings.''
</P>
<P>
   Park gave them 2202/3 innings, the most by far in his four-year
career. He went 192 last season when he tied Hideo Nomo for the
club lead with 14 victories.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Park went 8-1 during July and August, but went 1-2 with
a 5.11 ERA in September when the Dodgers were in the middle of a
tight division race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happens, they now know they can depend on me to give
them innings,'' Park said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the season ended Sunday, Park isn't done pitching. He
was scheduled to participate in an eight-game All-Star series next
month in Japan and represent Korea at the Asian Games in December.
The Dodgers are saying that is too much and Park is considering
dropping out of the All-Star tournament despite a $83,000 pay day.
</P>
<P>
   If Korea wins the Asian Games, Park will be excused from
military service.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might be the final chance I get to represent my
country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Red-eye Shaw: Closer Jeff Shaw left for home outside Cincinnati
at 11 p.m. Sunday and it's not certain if he'll be back.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is I'll be taking my son to school tomorrow,''
said Shaw, who recorded his 48th save in Sunday's victory. ``I
haven't made up my mind what I'm going to do other than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, 32, has 15 days after the end of the World Series to
demand a trade from the Dodgers, who acquired him at the All-Star
break. Because he was traded in the middle of a multi-year
contract, he has that leverage. He signed a four-year contract with
Cincinnati before the season that pays $2.8 million in each of the
next three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw played in Montreal for new GM Kevin Malone, who says he
will visit Cincinnati during the offseason. Shaw also can name six
teams where he cannot be traded.
</P>
<P>
   Bitter? There definitely was one player in Dodger Stadium not
rooting for the New York Mets to make the playoffs _ Brewers
starter Bill Pulsipher. Once considered the future ace of the Mets
staff, Pulsipher fell out of favor with manager Bobby Valentine
after missing considerable playing time with elbow problems. He was
traded at the July 31 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little bit of satisfaction because of the way the
Mets season ended,'' Pulsipher said after the Mets were swept this
weekend in Atlanta. ``I think they might have mishandled me a
little bit. I think that before Bobby Valentine came over, I was
expected to do big things for the organization. But once he came
over there, that kind of went out the window. I don't know why, but
that's the way things happened. I mean, I don't want to root bad
for the guys. I love the guys on the team and I think they're a
great team. But I didn't want to see them make the playoffs. That's
for sure.''

GALAXY'S DEFENSE DOUSES FIRE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ If Cobi Jones and Welton and Mauricio
Cienfuegos, the key figures in an attack that ate up opposing
defenses all season, have become synonymous with the Galaxy's
phenomenal success the past six months, then here's a message from
L.A.'s defenders: Don't forget what wins championships.
</P>
<P>
   That would be defense, and the Galaxy achieved its primary goal
Sunday night with a 1-0 triumph over the Chicago Fire before 20,105
at the Rose Bowl, finishing the regular season with the fewest
goals allowed, just 44 in 32 matches.
</P>
<P>
   Add it to all the marks L.A. notched in '98, from most wins (24,
shared with D.C. United) to most points (68) to most goals (85),
all league records.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize the offensive core of this team gets the majority
of the credit here,'' said defender Robin Fraser. ``It's nice to do
something where we can get recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing L.A. couldn't get Sunday was a scoring
title for Jones, who netted the goal _ an 87th-minute strike that
ended a 269-minute drought, the span of nearly three games _ but
couldn't catch Columbus' Stern John, who had two in a loss to D.C.
United and finished with 57 points, six more than Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Jones should also have had an assist _ he fed Carlos Hermosillo
for a goal three minutes earlier, but a poor offsides call took
care of that _ but no matter: The race was over before the game
kicked off.
</P>
<P>
   That left only one bit of suspense: Whether the Galaxy (24-8, 68
points) or the Fire (20-12, 56) would finish with the league's top
defense. Both entered the match having surrendered 44 goals.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared neither would give up another in a tight clash
played primarily between the boxes. Chicago's defense, led by Lubos
Kubik, allowed the Galaxy only one decent scoring opportunity,
which Jones put away.
</P>
<P>
   It came from Ezra Hendrickson, who took a pass from Carlos
Hermosillo, dodged two defenders near the end line, then knocked it
back to Jones, who settled it with his chest and fired past
goalkeeper Zach Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, a likely L.A. foe in the Western Conference final, was
without starters Chris Armas, Josh Wolff and Roman Kosecki, and
neither Peter Nowak nor Ante Razov played the entire 90 minutes.
Jorge Campos did play a half at forward and nearly tied the score
in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary goal,'' Razov said before the match, ``is that
nobody gets injured.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A win's always good,'' said Fraser, ``but you have to look at
what they did.... They didn't take this game seriously. I don't
think this was the big playoff preview it was hyped to be.''

STEELER DEFENSE, TURNOVERS DOOM SEAHAWKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ They held up despite being on the field for 38
minutes and 72 plays in muggy 85-degree heat.
</P>
<P>
   They withstood a 138-yard rushing effort by Jerome Bettis.
</P>
<P>
   They weathered chasing Kordell Stewart from one end of Three
Rivers Stadium to the other.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end Sunday, the Seahawks' defense could not overcome
its own offense in a hard-fought and hard-luck 13-10 loss to the
Pittsburgh Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   In a game that had a playoff atmosphere, and could end up having
playoff implications, the Seahawks lost for the first time this
season as their offense turned the ball over four times and set up
a pair of field goals by former Seattle kicker Norm Johnson that
proved to be the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the amazing part, we turned the ball over this much and
we were still in it at the end,'' said quarterback Warren Moon, who
threw his first interception of the season in the fourth quarter
and saw two of his completions fumbled away by fullback Mack Strong
and wide receiver Mike Pritchard.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks, now 3-1, could have won the game, played before a
revved up crowd of 58,413, if Moon's fourth-quarter pass into the
end zone had been caught by James McKnight. Instead, McKnight
turned the wrong way on the play and had the ball go off his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went right off my finger tips,'' McKnight said, staring at
his hands. ``I was not able to jump and bring it down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks could have tied the game if Todd Peterson's 52-yard
field goal attempt two plays later had not sailed just wide of the
right upright with 4 minutes, 38 seconds left to play. The snap
from center Chris Gray to holder Jeff Feagles was high. The wind
swirled around Three Rivers all afternoon. But Peterson used
neither excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind didn't affect it. I don't think it was the snap,''
Peterson said. ``I missed it. It was a big kick on the road. We get
the kick, we go into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't take advantage of this opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   And after creaming three puffs in their first three games, the
Seahawks let the chance to beat a quality opponent in a hostile
environment slip through their fingers. In a game where they could
have made a definite statement, the Seahawks couldn't complete the
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just cannot turn the ball over four times,'' coach Dennis
Erickson said. ``You can't do that and expect to win a game. That
was the difference in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   And the difference between being 4-0 for the first time in
franchise history. Now the Seahawks head into a Sunday night game
at Kansas City, where they have won just once in the past 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing we can take from this today is that we've got
to go into the same environment next Sunday and we've got to make
the plays,'' defensive end Michael Sinclair said. ``We've got to
make the plays, because we know Kansas City is going to make its
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The formula for the Steelers' victory was torn from Page One of
coach Bill Cowher's playbook.
</P>
<P>
   -- They ran the ball, chewed up the clock and wore down the
Seahawk defense by giving the ball 28 times to Bettis, their
255-pound back.
</P>
<P>
   -- They did not turn the ball over against a Seahawks defense
that had forced 10 turnovers in its first three games.
</P>
<P>
   -- And the Steelers forced turnovers _ a pair of fumbles by the
usually reliable Strong, the fumble by Pritchard and the Moon
interception, which came when the Seahawks quarterback was hit just
as he was releasing the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was good Steelers' smash-mouth football. Jack Lambert
would have loved to have played today,'' Pittsburgh linebacker Earl
Holmes said. ``We got The Bus (Bettis) rolling. We created
turnovers. That's what this defense has to do, set the tone and
control the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Seahawks were ``in this game from the first
kickoff,'' as Sinclair put it. And they were still in the game at
end.
</P>
<P>
   The ``drives'' to Johnson's field goals covered 5 and 8 yards.
The drive to the Steelers' only TD was a 13-play, 82-yard trudge
that consumed more than eight minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the TD came as Kordell Stewart pitched the ball to
Chris Fuamatu Ma'afala from the shotgun formation. With the
Seahawks blitzing from the right side, the rookie halfback ran
untouched into the end zone faster than you could say Fuamatu
Ma'afala.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Kordell called the play in the huddle, he said, `This is
for you, Fu. Get your big butt in the end zone. It's going to be
there,''' Fuamatu Ma'afala said of his first NFL score. ``I didn't
even hear the crowd cheering, but I loved it when all the players
ran to me and congratulated me.''
</P>
<P>
   The TD put the Steelers up 10-7 with 4:26 left in the first
half. The Seahawks never led after that, because of Strong's second
fumble, and Moon's interception, and McKnight's near miss in the
end zone, and Peterson's near miss a few plays later.
</P>
<P>
   So close. But still so far to go, what with the Chiefs' game
kicking off a string of six straight against AFC West opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing we can take is that we never gave up,''
McKnight said. ``Even though we had four turnovers, we never gave
up. We played hard and never stopped trying to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   A moral victory? Not on this day. Not even when the defense
played as hard and as long as it did. Not when the offense fumbled
away any chance the 3{-point underdogs had of stealing an upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``A loss is a loss,'' cornerback Shawn Springs said. ``There's
nothing positive about a loss.''

NEVADA PANEL PLAYS MIND GAME WITH TYSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Now, members of the Nevada State Athletic
Commission are being unfair to Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   The spirit of their decision at a hearing on Sept. 19 in Las
Vegas was this: If Tyson receives a positive evaluation from an
independent psychiatrist, he will be re-licensed to fight in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   This is why Tyson and his advisers reacted with elation when the
commission directed the fighter to see the therapist and agreed to
reconvene on Oct. 3. It seemed to be the last hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   However, last week, two of the commissioners said they will vote
to reject Tyson's application unless he can explain his alleged
assault of two men following a traffic accident in a Washington,
D.C., suburb last month, a still-pending issue that seemed to have
faded into the background.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioners are within their legal rights to reject Tyson
for no other reason than his original indiscretion, biting the ears
of Evander Holyfield. They made that clear on Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   However, the implication of their decision was that if Tyson did
his part, the commissioners, who agreed that Tyson is innocent
until proven guilty, would do theirs. Commission chairman Elias
Ghanem hinted as much immediately after the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they say he's normal and can fight again, then we have the
responsibility to maybe, probably, license him to fight again,''
Ghanem said.
</P>
<P>
   And the commission would have an out if Tyson is convicted of
the charges, according to their own legal counsel: It could simply
revoke the fighter's license once again.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last week, Ghanem did an about-face: ``I would vote no if
I have to vote today.''
</P>
<P>
   And vice chairman James Nave agreed, saying he rejects the
perfectly appropriate argument that Tyson cannot discuss the D.C.
incident because it is still pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to work for me. How can we license him without
knowing about (the alleged assault)?'' Nave said.
</P>
<P>
   So, the commission has put Tyson in a humiliating situation.
</P>
<P>
   He traveled to Boston to undergo psychiatric evaluation last
week, even though he already went through extensive tests by
apparently reputable therapists he hired, therapists who testified
at the hearing that their client is stable and should be allowed to
fight.
</P>
<P>
   And for what? So he could come back to Nevada to find that he
had jumped through a hoop only find another one?
</P>
<P>
   In response to the commissioners' turnabout, Shelly Finkel,
Tyson's adviser, said: ``It seems to me as if someone is playing a
game.''
</P>
<P>
   It makes one wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Here we go again: With Oscar De La Hoya's eye still black from
his Sept. 18 fight with Julio Cesar Chavez, Top Rank kicked off the
promotion for the WBC welterweight champ's Nov. 21 defense against
Ike Quartey.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya hopes the matchup _ largely seen as his first major
challenge _ will alleviate some of the criticism about his weak
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew all along I'd be fighting the best fighters,'' he said.
``It's just that I've had to be patient. Those who understand know
I needed experience to fight these fighters.''
</P>
<P>
   More De La Hoya: De La Hoya, still reveling in the fact he made
Chavez quit while sitting on his stool, promised he'd never do the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never, ever do that,'' he said. ``Even with a broken
nose, with both eyes completely shut, I'd never quit.''
</P>
<P>
   One more De La Hoya: De La Hoya said he won't trade punches with
Quartey as he did with Chavez, against whom he desperately wanted a
knockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can bang, I can take a punch,'' De La Hoya said. ``... This
isn't the right situation, though. He's more of a boxer-puncher. I
have to be careful, use my jab, my speed, keep my distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be smarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, one more: If he beats Quartey, De La Hoya is expected to
face either Frankie Randall or Oba Carr in February in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The three sites being considered are Mexico City, Guadalajara
and Monterrey.
</P>
<P>
   What went wrong?: Quartey seemed to be exposed as vulnerable in
his draw with Jose Luis Lopez in October of last year, his last
fight.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey, then the WBA welterweight champion, faded in the late
rounds and allowed Lopez to catch him in the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey's explanation? He had a bout with malaria in the weeks
before the fight and was unable to train properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sick,'' he said. ``You could see it the last couple of
rounds. I had malaria for two weeks. I missed four, five days of
training.''
</P>
<P>
   If it's true, if he was ill, De La Hoya could be in for a
surprise against this very talented boxer-puncher. If not, if he's
as easy to hit as he was against Lopez, De La Hoya could have his
finest moment in his fine career.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit punches: It's no surprise that Evander Holyfield and
Lennox Lewis turned in mediocre performances against Vaughn Bean
and Zeljko Mavrovic, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult for many of the most talented fighters to get
motivated against inferior opposition, especially fighters who have
been at it for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Should Holyfield and Lewis ever meet in the ring, motivation
wouldn't be a problem....
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Mayweather will be the first member of the 1996 Olympic
boxing team to fight for a world title when he faces WBC super
featherweight champion Genaro Hernandez of Los Angeles on Saturday
in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the more intriguing matchups of late, a talented,
rising fighter against an experienced, but still-sharp and
well-respected champion....
</P>
<P>
   WBO featherweight champion Naseem Hamed's defense against Wayne
McCullough on Oct. 31 in Atlantic City, N.J., is a terrible
matchup. Hamed will pick McCullough apart. &QL;

OFFENSE STRUGGLING, BUT SEAHAWKS SHOW LOOK OF CONTENDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ The numbers say there is a problem with the
Seahawks' offense.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers say there is cause for concern about what happens
now, when the Hawks meet the Chiefs and Broncos in the Armageddon
of their season.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, in their biggest test in any season since they were a
playoff contender, the Hawks' offense was exposed.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clicking, and you can't count the 38-0 shellacking of
the hapless Eagles in the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   The offense is not consistent. It is not keeping up with Darrin
Smith, Michael Sinclair and the rest of the awesome Seahawk defense
that wants to hand the offense easy wins.
</P>
<P>
   That much seemed clear, when the Hawks found themselves at Three
Rivers Stadium playing a playoff-like game against a buzzsaw
Steelers team out for blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard. It was ferocious out there. Both sides were
playing tough,'' said Seahawks running back Ricky Watters, who was
held to 47 yards on 17 carries in the 13-10 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a little rough. It was the whole bunch. But I could
tell right away they were fired up. `You're not getting nothing
today.'''
</P>
<P>
   And nothing, or next to it, is exactly what the Hawks got. They
got 61 yards on the ground off 21 running plays in an offense built
as much around Watters as it is quarterback Warren Moon or receiver
Joey Galloway.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the Hawks had four turnovers. Two by fullback Mack
Strong. One after a reception by receiver Mike Pritchard. One more
on a fourth-quarter interception by Moon, who has yet to find a
rhythm with his receivers in the Hawks' toned-down passing game.
</P>
<P>
   But before condemning the offense to the gallows, it is only
fair to consider the circumstances of this narrow defeat.
</P>
<P>
   This, folks, happened in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a playoff game,'' said Moon, who was 14-of-27 for 183
yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were executing pretty well. Probably didn't run it as well
as we liked but even the turnovers we had were positive plays. Mike
(Pritchard) had the first down (after his catch) and Mack had
busted off a good run and gets hit in the side. They were
well-blocked and well-executed but you can't put it on the
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what happens when you play in the Steel City, though.
It's not a punishable sin when it comes against a playoff-tested
team run by a hard-nosed, playoff-tested coach. Steelers coach Bill
Cowher refused to accept anything but a victory from his swarming
black and yellow keepers of the Steeler tradition.
</P>
<P>
   And the Steelers, after their 21-0 embarrassment last week in
Miami, must be credited for executing their game plan.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the third quarter, when Moon still had a chance to
Hail, Mary! the Hawks to victory, the Steelers produced a
crowd-frenzying, ear-ringing defensive stand.
</P>
<P>
   From first-and-10 on the Pittsburgh 24, the Steelers went for
the jugular, running blitzes at Moon and sacking him twice to
produce a third-and-18 that forced the Hawks to settle for a field
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of going ahead 14-13, the Hawks were left short at
13-10.
</P>
<P>
   That is where it stood. Until the bitter end.
</P>
<P>
   There is a Steelers mandate that says when you're at home _
where Pittsburgh is now 47-11 under Cowher in his seven seasons _
you can do no wrong. You can dominate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something to be said about that fact that the
Steelers believe, the fans believe, guys in the press box, the
equipment manager _ they all believe that the Steelers are going to
find a way to win,'' Seahawks linebacker Chad Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   And who would know better than Brown? The former Steeler can
only hope his new team can learn to do what his old team knows how
to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as a Steeler, they probably give you a little
injection when you come in. Yeah, it's a cultural thing. Players
come in and say `I'm a Steelers guy,' '' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Steelers did what's expected of them. They ran the
football. They didn't turn it over. And they caused turnovers and
they found a way to win. I'm sure if you go into coach Cowher's
locker room, I'm sure that's what he emphasized before the game, at
halftime and now he's praising them for doing it and winning the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the culture that surrounds a team that believes it will
find a way to win the close games.
</P>
<P>
   Four turnovers sunk the Seahawks. Four turnovers might be a sign
the Seahawks can't put the ball in the right player's hands at the
right time.
</P>
<P>
   Or, just as likely, four turnovers might be the wake-up call
that alerts the Hawks to make sure they find a way to win the close
ones.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers were glad to administer that important lesson to a
team that is still learning how to be a contender.

MARINERS FIND CLOSURE IN SEASON-ENDING LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Edgar Martinez wanted to end the season with his 30th
home run.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't happen, but something more surprising did. He stole
a base.
</P>
<P>
   By accident.
</P>
<P>
   With the Mariners well on their way to a 12-6 loss to the Texas
Rangers Sunday, Martinez received a standing ovation from the
37,986 fans at the Kingdome in the seventh inning after he swiped
third base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got confused on the signs,'' Martinez said. ``I looked at
Smitty (third base coach Steve Smith) and thought I saw the steal
sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez broke with the pitch and slid into the base ahead of
catcher Bill Haselman's throw, which arrived on the foul side of
the bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm lucky I made it,'' said Martinez, who now has stolen at
least one base in the past four seasons and has 33 thefts in his
career.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't the way the 35-year-old designated hitter drew up
his last-day-of-the-season plans. He reported to work with a home
run on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to swing for the fence, but had only one good
pitch to hit,'' Martinez said. ``The last guy (Rangers closer John
Wetteland) wanted to throw me a strike, and he's a guy who will
challenge you. I went up there trying to hit a homer.''
</P>
<P>
   All day long.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez walked on four pitches in the first inning, bounced
into a fielder's choice in the third, walked on four pitches in the
fifth, singled in the seventh and walked on four pitches in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   So, for the third time in his career, he finished the season
with 29 home runs. He also finished with 106 walks, 101 runs batted
in, a .322 batting average, one stolen base and a strong hunch that
he will return next season.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Mariners haven't made it official, the organization
is expected to pick up the option year of Martinez's contract,
paying him $3.5 million next season to divide his time between DH
and first base.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, who finished 76-85, 11{ games behind the Rangers
in the AL West, have until Nov. 15 to make a decision on Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Martinez will undergo arthroscopic surgery on
his left knee this week. He should be completely healed in time for
spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, a two-time American League batting champion, sizzled
down the stretch, going on a 27-for-52 binge during a
season-ending, 14-game hitting streak.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more impressive, Martinez was 136-for-385 (.353) in his
final 105 games.
</P>
<P>
   But the season left a bittersweet taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very tough year,'' he said. ``We had great
expectations, but it turned out to be a bad year. It's over now and
we can start planning for next year. You learn from a season like
this, and I think you get stronger going through something like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners learned that pitching and defense win games. Sunday
provided another reminder.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Spoljaric, starting in place of 15-game winner Jamie Moyer,
who has a blister on the middle finger of his left hand, was
blistered for nine hits and seven runs in 32/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Spoljaric finished the season with a 4-6 record and 6.48 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this game had meant something to the pennant race or
positioning in the postseason, Jamie would have pitched,'' Mariners
manager Lou Piniella said. ``Since it didn't, we switched (to
Spoljaric).''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella started most of his regulars, putting shortstop Alex
Rodriguez in the leadoff spot and Ken Griffey Jr. in the second
spot. Each had two at-bats before calling it a season.
</P>
<P>
   On Kids' Appreciation Day, Mariner youth had one last
opportunity to show off as Piniella began clearing his bench in the
fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The results were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Mac Suzuki, who has pitched well enough in September to warrant
a long look in spring training, ended his season yielding a
466-foot home run to Lee Stevens, the longest homer hit at the
Kingdome this season.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, Raul Ibanez singled home two runs while
Giomar Guevara doubled and scored and Charles Gipson singled,
walked and scored a run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a disappointing season, but got a chance to play some
young kids to see how they will fit in next season,'' Piniella
said. ``Our needs are pretty well defined. We have to shore up some
areas and report to spring training ready to contend again.''
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: Rodriguez finished with a 10-game hitting streak and
stole his 46th base Sunday. ... David Bell extended his hitting
streak to 12 games with a seventh-inning single. ... The Mariners
finished with a 1-72 record when trailing after eight innings. ...
Texas set a club record with 940 runs. The Mariners finished with
859, compared with 925 last season. ... Home attendance totaled
2,644,166, down 17.2 percent from 1997.

   My aunt, Dorothy Harvey, who is 96, is the last surviving member
of my mother's rather large family. She lives in Michigan and
although age has taken its toll on her body, her mind is sharp and
she is well versed in matters of the day. She is a hidebound
Republican and lets you know it.
</P>
<P>
   I call her regularly and, on occasion, have bantered with her
about the goings-on in the White House. I did so recently, after
the President's famous speech following his grand jury testimony,
and she launched into an expression of her feelings on the matter.
Eventually winding down, she paused briefly, then said slowly,
``But you know, I was never quite sure about Warren Harding.''

   One in a thousand? A million? Eileen Leeds, who lives in
Stamford, Conn., was recently on a Madison Avenue bus en route to
the Museum of the City of New York. As the bus approached the 90s,
most of the passengers had left and Ms. Leeds chatted with the
driver. Several hours later, Ms. Leeds left the museum. It had
started raining, there wasn't a cab in sight and, wet and
miserable, she headed for Lexington Avenue. Where could she find
shelter until the rain eased, she wondered, looking at the nearby
stores. Suddenly and to her great surprise because it wasn't a bus
stop, a Lexington Avenue bus pulled up, stopped and the horn
honked. The doors flew open and a voice cut through the downpour
and said, ``Hop in.'' It was the bus driver she had had on her
original journey. Talk about customer relations!

   It was one of the last performances of ``Colin Quinn: An Irish
Wake'' at the Helen Hayes Theater. A disgruntled theatergoer,
sitting near Laura Pedersen, returned from the concession area and
complained to seated friends, ``They call this an Irish wake, but
they won't even let you bring a drink to your seat.''
</P>
<P>
   They didn't need the coming revival of ``On the Town'' to
inspire them _ Sidney Sandler gave his prescription information to
the order taker for the AARP Pharmacy Service in Pennsylvania. He
followed this with his address and ended with ``New York, New
York.'' The following exchange ensued, short but a delight to both
participants.
</P>
<P>
   Order taker: ``It's a hell of a town.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandler: ``The Bronx is up.''
</P>

   Order taker: ``And the Battery is down.''

   My 6-year-old grandniece, Katharine MacComber, following her
parents' example, has become interested in the fat content of food.
One day recently, she and her mother visited my daughter at the
hospital, who was nursing her new son. Katharine had never seen a
mother nursing and was quite taken with the procedure. The
following morning she asked her mother ``Is a mommy's milk 1
percent or skim?''

   Elfin Frederick Vogel is still curious about what social
disaster he might have prevented. He was riding his bike home,
wearing a tie after a tieless casual summer, and stopped for a red
light at Third Avenue and 16th Street. A man, probably in his late
50s, approached him, wearing well-tailored slacks, blue blazer and
crisp shirt, but no tie. ``Would you sell me your tie?'' the man
asked. ``I'll give you $20 for it.'' The exchange was made. Vogel
pedaled off, but not before he saw the man put on the tie and smile
at the well-dressed woman next to him. Vogel pegged the woman's
look as equal parts of awe and disbelief.

   Lawrence H. Zisman understands that there are many mysteries in
life, from how the great pyramids in ancient Egypt were built to
when the universe will end. He even understands that there are more
than occasional mysteries involving the U.S. Postal Service. Still,
he wonders how a postcard sent from the La Jolla Presbyterian
Church in La Jolla, Calif., to a church member who lives on Azul
Street, also in La Jolla, was delivered to him in East Windsor,
N.J., along with his bills, magazines and sweepstakes entry forms.
</P>
<P>
   The card announced the date of a future ministry committee
meeting. Zisman called the California church so it could get in
touch with its parishioner. But he's now philosophizing about the
possible reason behind the rerouting _ could it have been a divine
message to convert to Presbyterianism and move to California? Who
knows?

   Is it possible that the couple Paul Drinkwater saw walking down
the street, each talking on a cell phone, were talking to each
other? Say it isn't so.

specialized in open-heart surgery. A member of operating teams at
two hospitals in the Chicago area, St. Francis and Christ, he would
operate in the morning and field calls in the evening about his
patients from the resident staffs. One evening during a visit, the
doctor was on the telephone talking to a resident at Christ
Hospital when the other phone rang. My sister-in-law answered, then
whispered to the doctor, ``It's St. Francis calling.''
</P>
<P>
   He whispered back: ``Tell St. Francis I'll have to call back.
I'm talking to Christ.''

   As he approached the box to mail his letter, a jogger happened
along wearing a sweatshirt emblazoned Arizona State University. He
stopped her, showed her the envelope and asked, ``Is Tempe,

PRESIDENT OF ARMENIA VISITS LOS ANGELES TO STRENGTHEN TIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE CONDON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Manoush Simonian and her husband, Hrand Simonian,
immigrated to the United States in 1952. She grew up in Israel and
he grew up in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Their ancestors were Armenian, but neither has ever lived in
Armenia and neither has any close relatives living there now.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday the couple were among 6,000 people who visited the
Universal Amphitheatre for a speech by Robert Kocharian, president
of the Republic of Armenia.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as we love the United States, we don't want to deny
our roots. That's why we're here today,'' said Manoush Simonian, a
63-year-old retired schoolteacher. ``We want to show how the United
States is a strong supporter of Armenia.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple said they have lived the American dream, having
retired after successful careers and raising three sons _ two
doctors and a lawyer. But it's important, they say, for
Armenian-Americans in Los Angeles to help support the people of
Armenia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We write checks. We invest money. We go there and open
businesses in Armenia,'' said Hrand Simonian, editor emeritus of
Armenian Life, a local Armenian-language newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, people such as the Simonians said they wanted to hear
from the president because of their concerns about the economy in
the Republic of Armenia, especially given the recent financial
crisis in nearby Russia. Kocharian used his speech to appeal to the
Los Angeles area's 400,000 Armenian-Americans to support their
homeland, which has struggled since becoming an independent nation
in 1991 and has been plagued by economic problems since a
devastating earthquake in 1988. ``That's why we're here _ to help
Armenia on its feet again,'' said Vic Meukomian, 42.
</P>
<P>
   Meukomian said many local Armenians, who are allowed to vote in
the country's elections, supported Kocharian.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Armenians are united behind him and what he's done,''
Meukomian said.
</P>
<P>
   Artin Sagherian, a journalist who works for an Armenian-language
paper called Massis, said Kocharian has made various proposals
designed to encourage investment by Armenian-Americans. Some of the
incentives include the possibility of generous tax breaks and dual
citizenship. Part of the purpose of the president's visit is to get
more money flowing into Armenia and to gain the confidence of
Armenian-Americans in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some wariness in the diaspora on investment,''
Sagherian said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have many who have done it who have been disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the economic issues, locals were impressed that
Kocharian was joined by both Armenian popes _ Aram I, Catholicos of
the See of Cilicia, and Karekin I, Catholicos of all Armenians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember in my lifetime ever seeing the president and
two Catholicos all together,'' Sagherian said. ``It symbolizes the
unity of the Armenian people.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Aram I and Karekin I led a service together
at St. Peter Armenian Apostolic Church in suburban Van Nuys, yet
another sign that serious progress is being made in reuniting the
Armenian Apostolic Church, Sagherian said. The church was divided
nearly 50 years ago after some Armenian Apostolic churches broke
away because of suspicions that the Soviet Union was taking too
much control of the church.
</P>
<P>
   Sagherian said many local Armenian-Americans hope the two
churches can be merged, but there are both financial and
administrative roadblocks to be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they are going to merge, but it doesn't look like it
will happen soon,'' Sagherian said.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Ayvazian, 50, said he hopes the president was impressed
with the turnout at the various events he attended.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. friendship is very important for Armenia. As
Armenian-Americans, we need to do our best to encourage the U.S.
government to be positive toward Armenia and to help Armenia,''
Ayvazian said.

LICKING WOUNDS, HUSKIES REGROUP FOR WILDCATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The room where Jim Lambright first tried to explain it
all was cramped, steamy and aging. It was only a little wider than
some of the holes DeAngelo Evans had just darted through.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska ran Lambright's Washington football team under a
thresher Saturday in Lincoln, 55-7, dropping the Huskies to 20th in
The Associated Press poll. And now, the challenge that awaits him
is one of the most fundamental to a coach's existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about how the kids feel,'' said Lambright's offensive
coordinator, Scott Linehan.
</P>
<P>
   The best coaches find a way to minimize damage and shepherd
their teams to goals still attainable. With 14th-ranked Arizona
(4-0) due here Saturday, Lambright must find a way to remind the
Huskies (2-1) that, embarrassing as it was in Lincoln, there's a
way out of this.
</P>
<P>
   ``By each player knowing that it's his responsibility to pump up
others,'' Lambright explained after his team took the practice
field Sunday night. ``It's so easy to stand back and be critical,
as opposed to helping.''
</P>
<P>
   Lo and behold, there's a parallel.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, in the previous-worst wipeout of his six-year
regime, the Huskies went to Notre Dame and were poleaxed, 54-20.
The next week at home, they roared to an early 28-0 lead against
UCLA, won big and launched a six-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of that 1996 season, the Huskies were still a game
behind Pac-10 champion Arizona State, and they lost to a
higher-ranked team, Colorado, in the Holiday Bowl. But they
finished 9-3 and a positive aura enveloped the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's already been brought up,'' Lambright said.
</P>
<P>
   There's at least one big difference now; this team doesn't have
Corey Dillon, that one did.
</P>
<P>
   And before the Huskies can achieve a rebound like '96, there are
some serious concerns to address:
</P>
<P>
   -- The run. Or lack of same.
</P>
<P>
   Inability to run against Nebraska is not breaking news, but the
Huskies had only 35 yards after three quarters. The high-tech
passing that yielded the Arizona State victory _ when it almost
seemed that Washington might be able to prosper without the run _
now seems more suspect because of ASU's reliance on basic defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamentally speaking, we've got a lot of work to do,'' said
Linehan, who indicated Washington is still committed to the pass.
``We've got to develop a reliable running game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to come up with three or four (plays), where it
doesn't matter what defenses are going to do, we're going to run
and have success with.''
</P>
<P>
   -- The wide receivers. The Husky wideouts haven't made plays
since the ASU game, aside from a gimpy Dane Looker.
</P>
<P>
   Ja'Warren Hooker _ albeit with a sore shoulder _ has only three
catches in 1998 for 20 yards. Now there is the possibility of
Washington being without Gerald Harris this week because of a
bruised sternum.
</P>
<P>
   -- Lester Towns. The junior linebacker is dying to be the
All-America-caliber player he could be, but his ailing foot won't
let him. He had at least three missed tackles in the decisive first
quarter Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At full health, he is a ferocious run-and-hit player. But it
appears he may battle the foot problem all season.
</P>
<P>
   At least he won't face any more serious doses of option. In his
current state he may be better against north-and-south offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lester is determined to help this football team,'' said Dick
Baird, his position coach. ``He hasn't had enough time to fully
heal up.''
</P>
<P>
   Towns has had not only foot but ankle problems. He hobbled out
to practice Sunday night with the help of a crutch.
</P>
<P>
   The Husky defense has yielded 818 rushing yards in two games
against Nebraska. Through the first three quarters Saturday,
Washington surrendered 19 plays of nine yards or more.
</P>
<P>
   Lambright scoffed Sunday at suggestions that the attack-style
defense he helped pioneer is unsuited to defending the option.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cal runs exactly the same defense,'' he said. ``What'd they
hold 'em to, 24? This defense is flexible enough to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be able to adjust to their people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nebraska loss continued a horrific trend of Husky defeats
against teams coming off a bye. And Arizona is catching two extra
days' preparation because it played Thursday night at San Diego
State.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Notre Dame defeat came after the Irish had a
bye. So did the Oregon and UCLA losses a year ago, and now
Nebraska. The four losses were by an average of 27 points.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's was the kind of defeat that eventually tore apart the
1997 team emotionally. The leaders on this UW team have said this
is a much tighter group, a contention that will now be tested.

GOP CONFIDENT OF GAINING ASSEMBLY SEATS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT KISCO, N.Y. _ ``Mostly, I lean toward Democrats, but there
are times you just need a Republican,'' Myrtle Several said.
</P>
<P>
   At the outlet mall here, near the saucepans and polo shirts, she
had just found retail politics _ in the person of Ursula LaMotte,
the Republican challenger who was campaigning for votes in her bid
against Assemblywoman Naomi Matusow, a Democrat. Ms. Several, 79,
came away impressed. ``She's working with Pataki, and I like him,
so I'm going to vote for her,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments have Democrats biting their nails and
Republicans smelling blood in Assembly races in the downstate
suburbs, across upstate and in a few parts of New York City.
Strategists on both sides predict that in November, Republicans
could gain five to 10 seats, which would be the Democrats' worst
setback in decades.
</P>
<P>
   Even a loss of 10 seats would not end the Democrats' 24-year
control of the chamber; they now have a 97-53 advantage. But it
would badly damage their ability to control legislation in the
house and to challenge the agenda of Gov. George Pataki, a
Republican, and the Republican-controlled Senate. It would also
weaken Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, possibly even leading to
calls to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in both parties predict that Pataki will trounce the
Democratic candidate, Peter Vallone, the New York City Council
speaker. Democrats fear the Republican governor's popularity could
spill over into Assembly races, especially if Democratic voters,
disheartened by Vallone's prospects and disturbed by President
Clinton's troubles, stay home on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the amount of money the Republicans have, and
obviously, Pataki's poll numbers are very high, there's certainly
reason for concern,'' said Assemblyman Thomas DiNapoli of Nassau
County, co-chairman of the Democratic Assembly Campaign Committee.
``I think if we hold our own, we'll be doing really, really well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans could gain one or two seats in a dozen open
contests. And there are, by most accounts, six to 10 vulnerable
Democratic incumbents. A top Democratic strategist said: ``We're
going to lose seats. The only question is, is it three, is it eight
or is it 10?''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, sensing opportunity, have recruited an unusually
strong corps of challengers, many of them elected officeholders
like Ms. LaMotte, 57, a county legislator. For the first time in
recent years, Republicans have nearly matched the Democrats in
fund-raising for Assembly races, and they are spending considerably
more than Democrats on advertising and ``get out the vote''
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say we've got the best crop of Republican candidates
for the Assembly in 30 years,'' said John Faso, the Assembly's
Republican minority leader, who helped recruit many of those
candidates. ``We have a popular governor and we've had some fairly
successful fund-raising. I won't talk about numbers of seats, but
we are very, very confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Matusow has always had to campaign hard to win, and this
year, she is once again one of the Republicans' top targets. She
won her northern Westchester County seat in 1992, barely defeating
an 18-year Republican incumbent, and her two re-elections were
close races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not supposed to have won this district,'' she said while
going door-to-door on a tree-shaded street in Katonah. ``I know
it's going to be rough again this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the Democratic incumbents who, like Ms. Matusow, are
judged most vulnerable, are running in the suburbs, including
Steven Englebright, Debra Mazzarelli and Paul Harenberg of Suffolk
County. Two others are in New York City: Eric Vitaliano of Staten
Island and Ann Margaret Carrozza of Queens, and there are several
more upstate.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the Assembly Democrats, Ms. Matusow, a former math
teacher, is often labeled the most at risk, and her race
exemplifies the Democrats' troubles. She is a moderate in an
affluent district where Republicans outnumber Democrats, usually a
sure formula for Republican dominance because Republican voters are
less likely to cross party lines. And Pataki is extremely popular
here, even among Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans like Ms. LaMotte believe they have found the
Democrats' liability in Silver, a Democrat from Manhattan. Hoping
that his name is poison outside New York City, they are linking
their opponents to him at every turn. The Republican Party has been
broadcasting ads upstate warning of ``Sheldon Silver and the New
York City liberals'' eager to plunder the state.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. LaMotte says her goal is ``keeping the state going in the
direction Gov. Pataki has started.'' Of her opponent, she tells
voters: ``Ninety-seven percent of the time she's voted with Sheldon
Silver. She's in lockstep with him.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Ms. Matusow has been as independent as Albany's rigid
party discipline will allow. Early this year, when Silver blocked a
popular measure to limit parole for violent criminals, she voted
for it, and publicly called on him to reverse his position. (He
did, and the bill passed.) She has also voted against budgets
drafted by her party's leadership, calling them wasteful.
</P>
<P>
   Her campaign pitch, like those of many of her Democratic
colleagues, is devoted largely to issues that ally her with Pataki,
like tax cuts and the parole bill, though she does not mention the
governor. And she is quick to note her differences with the
speaker.

A BLESSING FOR EVERYONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The 1998 baseball season can be remembered as
``That 70s Show.''
</P>
<P>
   God bless Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   And God bless Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and God bless Mike Piazza's pursuit of a $100 million
contract this offseason. If anyone deserves it....
</P>
<P>
   _The Mets' five-game screeching losing streak to end the season
means we won't be tormented by the vision of Piazza's sideburns
this week....
</P>
<P>
   _One way to look at it: McAndro ended up with more long flies
than !ital!six teams had total victories this season. And he tied a
seventh....
</P>
<P>
   _The most amazin' stat in this area code is still the 27-win
season Steve Carlton had in '72 even though his own Phillies
managed to avoid losing just 59 times....
</P>
<P>
   _The next unbreakable single-season record in major sports worth
shooting for: Wayne Gretzky's 92-goal season in '81-82. And that
was in 80 games....
</P>
<P>
   _Would Kerry Wood have been a better bet to hurl the Cubs into
the postseason? Better question: Would he have smacked a two-run
double in the fourth to put his team up 3-1?...
</P>
<P>
   _Anything happen in the NFL Sunday?...
</P>
<P>
   _Gotta catch the headline on the cover of Mother Jones (Sept.
issue) on Rupert Murdoch. Spoofing the infotainment style of Rupe's
media holdings, the banner screams: ``Heartless Man in Spineless
World!''...
</P>
<P>
   _The Dodgers' gatekeeper is also appropriately fingered as a
``World-Class Tax Dodger!'' in one of the MoJo stories included in
a special spoof-tabloid pullout. A U.S. citizen since 1985 (and a
Beverly Hills resident), Rupe paid $103 mil in taxes last year on a
$1.32 bil operating income _ a paltry 7.8 percent effective tax
rate. How? It's simple, Sydney. He bases his empire down under in
Australia even though a majority of his cash flow comes from U.S.
operations. A combination of international tax laws and ``fancy
paperwork'' had him show !ital!losses on the U.S. ventures and
!ital!profits in the low-tax locations like the Cayman Islands and
Bermuda....
</P>
<P>
   _It's like saying the Dodgers' season has been a loss despite
their finish above .500....
</P>
<P>
   Oh, it !ital!was, wasn't it?...
</P>
<P>
   _If Felipe Alou doesn't want to be the skipper on Graziano's
Island _ Montreal is itself such a tax haven _ there's no use
looking farther than over here at Kevin Kennedy.

`PHOENIX': A PASSION FOR DOING THE RIGHT THING (AND GAMBLING)
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Character and conversation outweigh momentum and suspense in
``Phoenix,'' but a gifted cast, led by Ray Liotta, who was a
co-producer of this story of corrupt police detectives in Arizona,
splashes alluring color across its familiar noir.
</P>
<P>
   Liotta plays Harry Collins, who is literally and figuratively an
appealing loser. Even Chicago, the sinister shaven-headed mobster
who holds Harry's gambling markers and talks like either Sylvester
the Cat or Daffy Duck, likes him. But Chicago is not ready to
forgive Harry's debts.
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of ways that Harry can get the $32,000 he needs
to pay Chicago. One of his crooked detective partners suggests
killing Chicago. But Harry spurns the offer. Harry has his code of
honor. To begin with, he says, you never welsh on a bet.
Furthermore, ``You never betray a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Chicago (Tom Noonan) offers a way out. Harry could repay
his debt by killing a prisoner named Joey who, Chicago fears, might
exchange damaging testimony for leniency. But softhearted Harry
simply offers Joey advice. ``You never rat out anyone,'' he
counsels. ``It doesn't pay in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the characters in ``Pulp Fiction,'' those in ``Phoenix,''
written by Eddie Richey and directed by Danny Cannon, like to talk.
Led by Liotta, they talk about the vocabulary of television
cartoons and the construction of the doors and walls of the native
village in ``King Kong.'' They talk about the great bluesman Robert
Johnson and Dostoyevsky and parasitic relationships as depicted on
television by National Geographic.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Harry's gambling compulsion rages unabated, his
detective partners are busily moonlighting for a loan shark,
practicing brutality and conducting illicit sexual affairs, and the
clock is ticking both for Harry and the audience.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Phoenix'' finally settles down to business, Harry's
partners _ well played by Anthony LaPaglia, Daniel Baldwin and
Jeremy Piven _ decide for various reasons to help Harry rob Louie
the loan shark (Giancarlo Esposito), who loads the safe in his
strip club with a lot of money at around 2:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, Harry will be having breakfast with Leila
(Anjelica Huston), the barmaid who has a heart warm enough to care
for Harry and eyes sad and clear enough to know that he is fatally
flawed.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone in ``Phoenix'' shares Harry's code of honor,
and before the day is over, there will be plenty of betrayal. For
patient viewers who enjoy amusing conversation and substantive
portrayals, the good of ``Phoenix'' is in the details.
</P>

<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Hurricane Georges, rampaging again after earlier
devastating islands in the Caribbean and the Florida Keys, slammed
into the seaside cities and resorts of the Gulf Coast on Sunday
night with rain-packed winds of up to 105 miles per hour and a sea
surge of 10 feet or more.
</P>
<P>
   Recharged after a three-day wander at 10 mph across the Gulf of
Mexico's tropical waters, the storm first began to move ashore
early Sunday evening with 50 mph winds at the leading edge. As the
night wore on, the winds grew stronger, blowing twice as hard near
the eye of the storm.
</P>
<P>
   There was concern that the storm, one of the most dangerous to
hit the vulnerable, low-lying gulf region in many years, might not
move immediately inland if it collided with a high-pressure area to
the north.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, disaster experts said, there was the possibility
of catastrophic damage from a lingering pounding by wind, rain and
surf along the coastal strip that stretches for more than 300
miles, from just east of Panama City in the Florida Panhandle to
just west of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Early damage reports made no mention of deaths or injuries, but
cities, towns, and resort strips in the path of the storm were
already suffering, with extensive power failures, large numbers of
downed trees and widespread damage to windows and roofs.
</P>
<P>
   Waves from the Gulf of Mexico leaped across beachfront roads
along Route 90 in Mississippi, and thousands crowded into almost
250 shelters along the state's coast. Winds were gusting up to 55
mph as the storm advanced.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, sheets of rain were driven by 65 mph wind gusts in
Mobile and Baldwin Counties, and the hurricane's 25-foot waves
clipped off fishing piers along the coast.
</P>
<P>
   By midnight ET, the hurricane's center was about 70 miles
south-southeast of Biloxi, Miss., from which thousands of people
had fled, and 105 miles east-southeast of New Orleans. Wind blew at
about 105 mph, and forecasters said that might increase to 120 mph.
The hurricane was moving north-northwest at 6 mph, and its center
was expected to reach the Gulf Coast Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the southeastern part of Louisiana, the tidal surge topped a
levee in Venice, sending eight to nine feet of water into the small
fishing community. Power had been knocked out for at least 38,000
customers in the that part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the coastal region here is only a few feet above sea
level. New Orleans, which is surrounded by levees, lies an average
of six feet below sea level. On the northeast side of the city, the
storm surge in Lake Ponchartrain was pushing water up against some
levees, and now and again a rogue wave crested over the top.
</P>
<P>
   The city has many pumps to handle water accumulated in its
streets and open spaces, including rain water. But the pumping
system was not designed to handle a huge amount, including a
massive overflow of levees by Lake Ponchartrain and sustained
downpours that could exceed 20 inches.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of any reports of deaths or injuries from the storm was
a testament, in part, to the fact that coastal residents were given
early warnings of the storm and told that those who could should
batten down or evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   Since it formed in the Atlantic off the west coast of Africa a
couple of weeks ago, and started to blow west, Hurricane Georges
has caused more than 300 deaths, most in the Dominican Republic,
and has left more than 150,000 people homeless in Haiti. Damage
estimates range in the billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a devastating storm,'' said James Lee Witt, head of the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, as his teams prepared to move
into the Gulf Coast area once the hurricane moves on.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of coastal residents fled northward in the
hours before the storm blew ashore, so many that on many highways,
cars, vans and trucks were bumper to bumper for miles on end.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of others took refuge in schools, public buildings and
other shelters.
</P>
<P>
   In the gulf, about 26 miles southeast of Chandeleur Island, a
disabled freighter wallowed in 20- to 30-foot seas, dragging its
anchor as the hurricane pushed it around in an area full of
offshore oil platforms, the Coast Guard said. The 490-foot
freighter, the Golden Star, had 17 crew members aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Glynn Smith of the Coast Guard said the freighter and its
tugboat were drifting southwest, but were trying to set up a tow
from the stern of the freighter, to pull it clear of oil platforms.
</P>
<P>
   The ship had no known cargo but carried about 58,000 gallons of
oil in its fuel tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The freighter had been under tow, from Beaumont, Texas, to
Tampa, when a line to the oceangoing tug Sovereign snapped.
</P>
<P>
   Here in New Orleans, some 10,000 were housed in the hallways and
corridors of the Superdome, many spreading their blankets on the
concrete and doing what they could, with their books and puzzles
and bags of chips, to make the best of a bad situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here before for football games, but this ain't no
game,'' said Demetrius Moody, an oil rig operator, as he slumped in
an end-zone seat in the arena.
</P>
<P>
   In places along the coast where there were no levees to protect
people and property, the emergency authorities ordered residents to
evacuate. Most moved to higher ground with few, if any, complaints.
</P>
<P>
   And even in areas where evacuation was not mandatory, thousands
left anyway, heeding the words of Mayor Marc Morial of New Orleans,
whose pre-storm mantra was: ``Our recommendation to people is to
go. We're in a state of emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   The French Quarter of downtown New Orleans _ where the
unofficial motto is ``Let the good times roll!'' and where the
streets are normally packed with noisy partygoers _ was nearly
abandoned in the hours just before the storm hit.
</P>
<P>
   Plywood sheets covered windows and doors on Bourbon Street.
There was no whiff of Creole cooking, no pungent smell of coffee.
Most telling of all, even the bars that sell that most lethal of
alcoholic concoctions, the hurricane, were battened down.

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright pushed
Monday for agreement on key details of a long-stalled peace
agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, meeting jointly for
the first time in nearly a year with Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu of Israel and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting came only hours before Netanyahu was scheduled to
fly to Washington to meet with President Clinton, and Albright did
not rule out the possibility that Arafat would also travel to
Washinton Monday to join in the White House talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an important meeting,'' Albright said in a brief news
conference after her joint negotiations with the Israeli and
Palestinian leaders, which ended here shortly after midnight with
handshakes among the three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to talk about any of the substance of it,''
Albright added. ``We still have as lot of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said that an overall peace agreement was still not
imminent. But American officials said the White House was eager to
announce some concrete progress in the Israeli-Palestinian talks at
Monday's meeting between President Clinton and Netanyahu if only to
show that American foreign policy had not been hobbled by the
scandal resulting from the president's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is great interest in showing that we're not being
sidetracked by the circus in Washington,'' said a U.S. official,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``We want to lock in key
elements of this agreement while all of the parties are still in
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Sunday, Netanyahu suggested that he and
Arafat were still far from agreement on several issues, most
importantly the security arrangements for areas of the West Bank
that Israel would cede to the Palestinians under a new peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we don't have yet is the whole Palestinian side of this
equation,'' he said. ``How do they assure us the areas that we hand
over to them and have handed over to them do not become bases of
terrorism?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he believed that Clinton's ability to focus on foreign
policy _ and specifically on the Middle East peace effort _ had
suffered because of the scandal in Washington, Netanyahu replied,
``Not at all.''
</P>
<P>
   After nearly 18 months without visible progress in the peace
process, Israel and the Palestinians are reported to be close to a
deal under which Israel would turn over 13 percent of the West Bank
to the Palestinians, with a quarter of that designated as nature
reserves to prevent Palestinian settlements. But several details
remain unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   Time for further negotiations on American soil has nearly run
out. Netanyahu is expected back in Israel on Tuesday for the Yom
Kippur holy day.
</P>
<P>
   There is something of a deadline for the talks: May 4, when the
Oslo peace agreements that provide the framework expire. Arafat has
said that if there is no settlement by then, he will declare a
Palestinian state, a move that would outrage Israel. Netanyahu has
warned that a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state could
scuttle peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   According to a draft of a speech he delivered Sunday in New
York, Arafat was prepared to repeat the pledge. Without an
agreement by next May, ``We will have no choice but to unilaterally
declare the establishment of the Palestinian state,'' it said. ``We
do realize the implications and consequences of this on
Palestinian-Israeli relations as a whole and also on Arab-Israeli
and international relations.''
</P>
<P>
   But in what may have been a concession to Israeli sensitivities
and a response to pressure from the United States, those lines were
dropped when Arafat delivered the speech, and he referred only
cryptically to the May deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international community, all peace-loving people, must
exert every possible effort to insure the implementation of the
agreements by May 4, 1999,'' Arafat said in his speech, at the
Center for Middle East Peace and Economic Cooperation, a private
group. ``It just cannot come and go like any other day.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Israeli officials are waiting anxiously to hear what
Arafat will say when he addresses the General Assembly on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Arafat have not attempted to dampen speculation that he
will use the speech to criticize Netanyahu's government harshly and
to solicit support for his plans to declare
</P>
<P>
   In his speech on Sunday, Arafat accused Netanyahu's government
of ``procrastination and evasion'' in the peace talks.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
IRVING _ This time, it happened late in the third quarter. Another
line-drive punt straight into the hands of Deion Sanders and
another beeline straight up the middle of the coverage team. He
broke left past the Cowboys' bench and was heading for the end zone
until Calvin Branch ran him down from behind after covering 60
yards.
</P>
<P>
   No return touchdown from Rev. Prime Time. No salvation for the
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   So blame it on Deion. All he has to do is score two spectacular
touchdowns a week by sprinting through traffic with punts and
interceptions, and Dallas cruises straight to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome back to reality.
</P>
<P>
   This is the way it's going to be for the Cowboys all season long
_ a tough, hard struggle.
</P>
<P>
   This is the way it's going to be for backup quarterback Jason
Garrett each week until the injured Troy Aikman returns _ a battle
to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why head coach Chan Gailey wasn't the least bit
surprised with an ugly 13-12 loss to the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made too many bad plays to win this game,'' he said. ``We
made a big bad play on defense. We made several big bad plays on
offense. We shot ourselves in the foot all in the red zone.''
</P>
<P>
   So, other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did you like the play?
</P>
<P>
   The defense, with the exception of a ball that bounced off Kevin
Smith's shoulder pads and into the arms of James Jett for a 75-yard
touchdown, did all it was supposed to do.
</P>
<P>
   It was the offense, breaking down more times than presidential
reasoning, that repeatedly left the Cowboys standing in the lurch.
</P>
<P>
   The offense moved the ball into Oakland's end of the field seven
times in 10 possessions yet came away with only one touchdown on
the day.
</P>
<P>
   The largest part of those failures can be placed at the feet of
Garrett. In last week's win over the Giants, he completed 12 of 28
passes for 222 yards and did not throw an interception. Against the
Raiders, he connected on 18 of 33 passes for an identical 222
yards, but he threw away two critical opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Facing second-and-goal at the Raiders' seven in the third
quarter, Garrett made a bad read on a pass to Irvin that resulted
in an interception at the goal line by rookie Charles Woodson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael went inside, and I threw the ball to the outside,''
Garrett said. ``It was my fault. Just say I was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But not done.
</P>
<P>
   With just more than 90 seconds left in the game and the Cowboys
still somehow holding a chance, Garrett made another poor decision
and heaved a deep rainbow into double coverage toward Billy Davis.
It was picked off by Eric Turner, finally putting a knife into
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   But there were other errors and bonehead plays all day long.
Garrett was called for a false start after he flinched his leg on a
third down, moving the ball back five yards. Shortly thereafter,
Richie Cunningham would miss a 37-yard field goal wide to the
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason did some good things, and then he did some things that
we would all like to have him do over,'' Gailey said. ``To be a
successful ballclub, you have to win your home games. To do that,
you have to be consistent. And to be consistent means that you have
to take advantage of the opportunities that are presented to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week when we beat the Giants, a lot of people wanted to
say that we had arrived. Well, I don't think that anybody arrives
after just one win. And I don't think you have proven yourself to
be a very good football team until you can do the things you need
to do consistently. Right now, we are a team that is trying to be
good.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Cowboys are now is about what you had a right to expect
at the start of the season. They are capable of taking care of a
bad team (Arizona) at home, of being hammered by a very good team
(Denver), of using several singular plays to beat an overrated team
(New York), and then coming right back and losing at home to an
average team (Oakland).
</P>
<P>
   Every game will be an adventure. Even the next one on the road
against the hapless Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of the Denver debacle, the Cowboys' defense
has played well. Kavika Pittman and Greg Ellis put decent pressure
on the Raiders' Jeff George all afternoon and dropped him for a
pair of sacks. In the second half, the front line did a good enough
job bottling up the running game of Napoleon Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   The special teams got a positive contribution from Sanders with
another 91 yards in returns, but the missed field goal by
Cunningham was costly.
</P>
<P>
   The offense was never anything but consistent. Emmitt Smith
gained 59 yards rushing on 21 carries before he took himself out to
nurse his ailing groin. And while Garrett was given credit against
the Giants for not doing anything to lose the game, this time his
errors were fatal.
</P>
<P>
   And this time, no Prime Time to cover them up.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
The Astros enjoyed a regular season so prosperous that they didn't
seem to want to let it end.
<TEXT>
<P>
   So on Sunday, they treated a crowd of 51,916 to 3 hours, 30
minutes of baseball, ending the game in familiar fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hidalgo drove home Carl Everett with an 11th-inning
sacrifice fly to complete a 4-3 come-from-behind victory over the
Chicago Cubs. It was the Astros' 49th comeback victory of the
season and marked the 27th time they won in their final at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   The ending was bittersweet for the Cubs, who could have clinched
the National League wild card with a victory. But mere moments
after the Astros finished them off, Colorado beat San Francisco on
Neifi Perez's ninth-inning homer, forcing a one-game playoff
tonight between the Cubs and Giants at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``With (National League president) Leonard Coleman in
attendance, I'm satisfied that we did our best to not just give the
wild card to the Cubs,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said. ``We
were a little sloppy at first, but we'll take a win any way we can
get one.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker will put his team through a light workout today before
opening the Division Series against San Diego on Tuesday at the
Astrodome. Sunday's battle was anything but a light workout.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros used five pitchers, including rookie reliever Scott
Elarton, who struck out three batters in two innings and notched
his second big-league victory. The Cubs managed one baserunner
against Elarton, who baffled them with a curveball that seemed to
catch the hitters by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the best breaking ball I've had all season,'' Elarton
(2-1) said. ``I don't know where that came from, but I hope it
stays around for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros did a good job of staying around in a game it
appeared they might well lose after the Cubs took a 3-1 lead in the
fourth inning. All of the runs against starter Mike Hampton were
unearned, thanks to errors by Ricky Gutierrez and Craig Biggio.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton allowed five hits in six innings and was saddled with
his 13th no-decision in 32 starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sort of overthrowing a little bit, but I got better as
the game went on,'' Hampton said. ``Even though we're already in
the playoffs, this was a big game with a lot of emotions because
the Cubs are trying to get in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' offense didn't give Hampton much help in his final
tuneup before the playoffs, but that had a lot to do with Cubs
starter Terry Mulholland, who struck out six batters in the first
three innings and stranded runners in scoring position in four of
his eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs took a 1-0 lead in the first when Jose Hernandez
reached on an error by Gutierrez and scored on Sammy Sosa's single
to center.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez atoned for his fielding miscue by leading off the
third with a base hit and scoring on Hidalgo's single to right. But
as if he wasn't doing enough damage to the Astros from the mound,
Mulholland made matters worse in the fourth inning with a
tie-breaking two-run double that just eluded Hidalgo in
right-center.
</P>
<P>
   Astros relievers Doug Henry, Sean Bergman, Billy Wagner and
Elarton combined to shut out the Cubs on two hits over the final
five innings, giving the Astros one last chance to work their
late-inning magic in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Run-scoring singles by Jeff Bagwell and Sean Berry tied the game
at 3 in the eighth, and a breakthrough appeared inevitable in the
10th when the Astros loaded the bases against Cubs closer Rod Beck.
But pinch hitter Bill Spiers popped out weakly on the infield, and
Gutierrez flied out to center to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Everett, who was out of the lineup because Hidalgo started in
center, ignited the Astros' 11th-inning rally with a one-out triple
to right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little fired up because I was disappointed in myself
from (Saturday's) game when I had a bad at-bat against Beck,''
Everett said. ``This time, he threw me a slider instead of a
forkball, and I was able to hit it off the wall. He got me
yesterday, but I got him today.''
</P>
<P>
   Cubs manager Jim Riggleman ordered Beck to walk Biggio
intentionally to bring Hidalgo to the plate. Hoping Beck could
induce a ground ball, Riggleman went with a five-man infield,
summoning Orlando Merced from left and leaving only Lance Johnson
and Sosa to patrol the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw that, I was thinking, `Wow! What is this?'''
Hidalgo said. ``That gave me more room to hit the ball into the
outfield.''
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo took Beck's first pitch but sent the second offering
deep enough into center field to allow Everett to score the winning
run easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know (Beck) likes to throw the ball down and that he was
going to try to get me to hit the ball on the ground,'' Hidalgo
said. ``But I waited for a good pitch, and I was able to get a
changeup up in the strike zone.''

CHASE HAS LIFTED SOSA'S STATUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Viva Sammy Sosa! One has heard that chant at Wrigley
Field all season. And one has heard it everywhere the Chicago Cubs
outfielder has gone in the last two months. Before this season,
only a handful knew or cared about the native of the Dominican
Republic. Now he has the world at his feet like no other Latin
player in history.
</P>
<P>
   In just a few months, Sosa has become a household name because
of his battle with Mark McGwire of the Cardinals in the Great Home
Run Derby. McGwire had two home runs Sunday to finish with 70, so
there is little chance Sosa can win it. He has 66 home runs with
one game remaining, Monday night at Wrigley Field against the
Giants in a playoff for the National League wild card. But Sosa's
performance and good humor throughout the races, home run and
wild-card, have earned him the recognition of a worldwide baseball
audience. His words and deeds have lifted him far above his Latin
contemporaries, and that is the way it should be.
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons to Roberto Clemente are in order. The star Puerto
Rican outfielder spent 18 seasons with the Pittsburgh Pirates and
was what is considered a five-tool player. He could do anything
that was needed _ hit, hit for power, run, field, and throw _ and
do it well. But as great as he was, he never came close to getting
the recognition that has come Sosa's way.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa is replacing Clemente in not only the Spanish-speaking
countries but around the major leagues, where the majority of fans
are English-speaking and white. It is Sosa's personality that is
doing what all the numbers posted by Clemente couldn't do. Before
this season, the best year for Sosa was 1996, when he hit 40 home
runs and drove in 100 runs. Last year, he finished with 36 home
runs and 119 runs batted in. But he also struck out 174 times,
which makes his performance this season under incredible pressure
even more remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa has had the benefit of competing with McGwire; it has
brought out the best in him. Along the way, he wiped out Hack
Wilson's club and National League record for homers, 56, and like
McGwire passed Roger Maris's 1961 record of 61. After the two tied
at 62, McGwire put on a couple of spurts and broke a 66-66 tie with
two home runs Saturday. Sosa's response was two singles and a hope
that McGwire would reach 70. He is that kind of guy.
</P>
<P>
   One has to wonder how Clemente, in all his greatness, would have
withstood the media blitz and fan interest of the past two months.
For McGwire, it came naturally. He hit 49 home runs as a rookie,
and only injuries have kept him from making a run at the record
before this. He knew he'd make his run sometime. He never figured
he'd have company along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa was no slouch. The Cubs recognized the improvement of his
skills and gave him a four-year contract over the winter, worth an
estimated $45 million. He has earned every penny in '98.
</P>
<P>
   Clemente wasn't about money. He played for relative peanuts in
his years with Pittsburgh (1955-1972). And when Clemente died Dec.
31, 1972, along with four others when a plane carrying them and
supplies to earthquake victims in Nicaragua crashed into the ocean,
that made him more of a hero to his Latin fans than his career
3,000 hits, his two World Series rings, and his 12 Gold Gloves. But
American fans had enough heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the home runs, Sosa's numbers fall short of
Clemente's. Clemente had more than 200 hits four times and batted
.300 or better 13 times. But Sosa is coming on. He's hit .300 or
better only twice, but has more home runs in 9 years 49 days than
Clemente, 273-240. More fans have watched Sosa in 1998 than may
have watched Clemente in his whole career. Media coverage today is
worldwide, both print and electronic. On the day Maris hit his 61st
home run in 1961, there were slightly more than 23,000 in the
stands at Yankee Stadium. Record numbers turned out in St. Louis in
early September when McGwire hit No. 62, against Sosa and the Cubs,
no less.
</P>
<P>
   There were 51,916 at the Astrodome Sunday. Sosa went 2 for 5,
with no homers, but the fans were not disappointed. The fact that
Sosa didn't quit after McGwire reached No. 62 excited people. As
fate would have it, Sosa had strong support in the road cities he
visited, Milwaukee, San Diego, and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The last two are border towns, close enough to draw not only
Spanish-speaking fans but also media, and Sosa obliged them in
their native tongue. He made himself available whenever he could,
win or lose.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs have been in a pennant race since early August, but
Sosa has made all his media and civic appointments, including a day
at Wrigley Field like no Cub before him ever has received. He
competed daily under the virtual demand for a home run by fans, the
media, and sometimes even the opposition. If this was a
distraction, he never let you know it.
</P>
<P>
   Clemente would have been proud.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can argue about quite a few people,'' said Mark Grace, who
gracefully answered questions night after night about his teammate
and never once showed irritation. ``But Sammy's numbers are better
than anybody in the game of baseball. There was no question that he
was the main cog in our engine. But we also knew if the rest of us
didn't perform to our abilities, we're not going to win anything.
When we got down to the last day of the season with a chance to
make the playoffs, we'd all done our jobs. That's all you can
ask.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa and Clemente have similar roots. Clemente grew up in
poverty in Puerto Rico; Sosa used to shine shoes to make a buck in
the Dominican Republic. As personalities, they were very different,
said Phil Regan, the Cubs' pitching coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clemente was more of an introvert,'' said Regan. ``He was not
an outgoing personality. Sammy is street-smart. He knows how to
meet people and talk to people. He does a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   Regan knew and understood both. He faced Clemente as a pitcher
with the Dodgers and Cubs in the 1960s. He spent four years in the
1980s managing the Dodgers' farm club in Santo Domingo. Regan
recalls an 18- or 19-year-old Sosa, a Texas Rangers farmhand in
1987, who needed a break to survive. He was only a part-time player
and his home in San Pedro de Macoris was two hours away by car or
bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sosa was responsible for getting back and forth,'' recalled
Regan. ``One morning, he came to me and said, `I can't play
anymore,' He couldn't always get a ride back and forth and was
going to quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to our owner and we got him a room at a hotel in
Santo Domingo. After we did that, he finally became a regular. We
went on that year and won the Caribbean World Series. He was a big
part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Regan said even then one could see a great player in the making.
But it didn't happen quickly, as was the case with Clemente. It
didn't surprise him that Sosa went up and down with Texas and the
White Sox before winding up with the Cubs in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time,'' said Regan, ``he wasn't disciplined at the
plate. He didn't know the strike zone. He was so young. He didn't
always hit the cutoff man and ran the bases wrong sometimes. But
there is a reason for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes a young Latin is judged too quickly. Remember, they
don't have the Little League structure down there, the high
schools, and the colleges, where they go through a process of
learning how to play. You go on a playground there and there are
kids playing with a rag ball and a bat made out of a tree and
gloves made from milk cartons. Sosa's rise took time, but you could
see that all of the talent was there.''
</P>
<P>
   After his arrival in Wrigley Field, Sosa came into his own,
playing in 162 games in 1997. Cubs general manager Ed Lynch came
under some fire when he re-signed Sosa to that long-term contract
last winter. Nobody is complaining now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scouting isn't an exact science,'' Lynch said recently. ``We
knew that Sammy was a five-tool talent. Additionally, you knew he'd
run out every ball, chase every fly ball, and give you 162 games
plus. We heard the critics. But you're basically talking about a
player in the prime of his career. He was already a superstar and
very popular with Chicago fans. Now everybody loves him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa didn't get off to a record start this year. In fact, after
47 games he trailed McGwire, 24-9, and wasn't considered a threat
to the home run title. That changed in June, when he hit 20 to set
a major league record. He also drove in 40 runs that month, and
suddenly the Cubs were a team that rated attention. It became clear
they had a shot at the NL wild-card slot, and they waged a battle
with the Mets through August and September. San Francisco joined
the hunt in the last few weeks, and the Cubs and Giants meet Monday
night for the wild card.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa got a major share of the credit for his team continuing to
hang on. But he wouldn't accept much of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything happens because I'm in the middle of a playoff
race,'' he said. ``What I like the most is that my team is behind
me 100 percent. I've been there every day. I never think about
(being) Most Valuable Player. I just go out and work and try to
help the Chicago Cubs make the playoffs.''

<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ After the his team's final game last year,
owner Jonathan Kraft noted that Walter Zenga had been his favorite
Revolution player. Soon after, Zenga retired and the Revolution
failed to recover _ until Zenga returned as coach for the final six
games of this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to jinx anything, but we are interested in Walter
coming back next year,'' Kraft said after the Revolution suffered a
shootout loss to the New York/New Jersey MetroStars in the final
game of the regular season Saturday night. ``He has shown he can
coach. He made the transition in a short time and he has been very
busy. But we would like to get that done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kraft family has accomplished many of their goals since the
MLS began in 1996. But they have failed to develop a team that was
nearly successful on the field as off, except when Zenga has been
involved.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution won three games in Zenga's one-month tenure after
having won six in five months under Thomas Rongen. They still
finished with the MLS's worst record (9-21-2) and earned 29 points
in 32 games, their lowest total ever.
</P>
<P>
   But at least under Zenga, the Revolution started to assume an
identity. Rongen had hoped to make them a high-scoring,
risk-taking, tight-wire act. Zenga stressed defense and safety
first. That formula, combined with Zenga's inspirational qualities,
brought security to the players.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution accomplished four of their six shutouts and
outscored opponents, 11-6, in the last six games. This raises
questions about Zenga's role next year. If the Revolution are this
effective defensively, would Zenga become superfluous as a
goalkeeping player-coach? Would he raise their level even higher as
a coach on the field? Or, would Zenga become less effective trying
to accomplish both tasks?
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter Zenga the coach is going to have to make a tough
decision about Walter Zenga the player,'' general manager Brian
O'Donovan said. ``The last six games have shown we have a core
group of players he can build around. It would be difficult to
throw that out and start from scratch. But he has said he needs
more variety and he has declared his philosophy as a coach is to
make sure he has a good defense. It allows the midfielders and
forwards to create, knowing they have a good defense behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next two weeks, Zenga and assistant coach Sid Mazzola
will continue to train Revolution players, along with invited
players such as defender Paulo Montero, who has been playing for
the Lowell Blues in the Luso American Soccer Association.
Midfielder Damian will return to Mexico to play for America.
Trinidadian midfielder David Nakhid, who did not play under Zenga
after starting most of the season, likely will join another team.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no rush, no deadline, for Walter to make a
decision,'' O'Donovan said. ``Walter is under no pressure. I would
think something will be decided by the end of October. If Walter
decides not to do the job, he would probably go back to Italy
sooner than that. The circumstances are right, but this is a
personal decision and it has to be right for him. He decided last
year it wasn't right for him, but it wasn't because he wanted more
money or a better contract.''

HARRINGTON HOPING WILD CARD PAYS OFF FOR SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL McDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ The laugh contained a combination of joy and relief.
``This might cost us a million dollars,'' said Red Sox CEO John
Harrington with a wide smile, thinking of what the prospect of the
wild-card berth will mean to the team's bottom line. ``Really, we
set our budget to spend $10 million more this year than we did a
year ago, but we raised our prices in the ballpark, hoping we could
match it. We did. Right now, though, if we don't get into the
American League Championship Series, it will cost us.''
</P>
<P>
   But Harrington could not care less at this point. This has been
a critical season for the franchise. He is the one who gambled,
with a push from general manager Dan Duquette and manager Jimy
Williams, on going way over budget, trying to get the team to the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When last season was over,'' said Harrington Sunday, relaxing
in his office while the Red Sox were down below closing the regular
season with a win over Baltimore, ``the three of us met in Florida
at the Instructional League and talked about the future. I think
from that conversation the three of us are joined at the hip _
myself, Dan, and Jimy. We all made a commitment to get where we are
right now. Both of them said that if the ballclub put out the
money, they would bring results, and they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington gets great satisfaction from the Red Sox earning a
spot in the playoffs via the wild card. He was one of the wild
card's first boosters, and has been behind the concept since its
inception. ``We got it passed in '93 to go into effect in '95. Can
you imagine how it would be here today if we finished with the
second-best record in the American League and weren't in the
playoffs? No one has mentioned that. It would have been a tragedy.
We're finishing with a better record than either Texas or
Cleveland, and with the old system we would have been out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is important for the Red Sox that they get beyond Cleveland
and into the ALCS. ``A team loses money in the playoffs unless it
gets to a fourth and fifth game in a series,'' Harrington said.
``Virtually all of the money from the first three games in a series
goes to the players and expenses. If we don't get to the ALCS, it
will cost us about a million dollars. But if we win, we can start
to make money, and that would be significant for our future.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington is putting the future on hold until the Sox get
through playing, but he knows what the offseason lineup will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as it is over, we will talk with Mo (Vaughn) and his
people and get an idea of whether he wants to stay here or not,''
Harrington said. ``We would love to have him on our team, and we
hope he is. At the same time, we know that the agents for other
free agents will be at our door, trying to get us interested in
their players. We are not going to sit still. We know that we are
going to go after another front-line pitcher. We don't know who
that is, but whoever is out there, we will be in the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were something like fourth in total payroll this year, and
if you look at the way the playoffs are shaping up, the teams that
spent the most are the teams that will be in the postseason. It's
kind of sad it works that way. Someone (in baseball) told me the
other day that every team in the major leagues that spent $44
million or below on their payroll played less than .500 ball, had a
losing season. Money is the key in this business now. If you don't
have it, you can't compete. That's why we are constantly looking
for new ways to generate revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Vaughn and free agency situations are resolved, the
Sox will try to close a local television deal to get an idea of
what kind of revenue will come from that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two things going on with TV right now,'' said
Harrington. ``There are a couple of outfits (networks) interested
in buying the rights to all of our games on television. There are
other people interested in buying NESN (New England Sports Network,
in which the Sox are the major partner). Some are talking a 10-year
deal for our rights that might get up around the $400 million area.
But I don't think that will happen this year. Time is running out.
I do think it will happen two or three years from now. It would be
a major deal, and very complicated, so we need more time. But the
people talking with us about that are very serious. They want to do
it, and so do we.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington and his top aides have been jugglers the past year,
working with Duquette toward the on-field improvements, and with
bankers, investment counselors, and the like toward a new Fenway
Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pulling a lot of loose ends together right now,'' he
said. ``We have an idea of what the park will be like. Around
45,000 seats. About 100 luxury boxes. About 5,000 preferred seats.
What we don't know is how much we can get for them, and then, if
they will give us enough money to pay for the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good idea of what the land acquisition costs will
be. We've had experts work with us on that. It will probably be
between $80 million and $100 million. Then we have to add on the
cost of a new park, but we don't know what that is yet. Two hundred
million? Three hundred million? We don't know. But we will in
January, and then we will have to make a hard decision on whether
we can do it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington said at the earliest, with everything coming together
right, the Sox would be thinking about playing their first game in
a new park in 2004. ``I hope I'm around to see it,'' he said with a
laugh. ``These things are not easy. It's going to be a grind. But I
like the timing. Baseball has turned it around. We have the nucleus
of a good club for the future. Except for Mo, we have our key
players signed for the future. This year baseball will draw 70
million fans for the first time ever. From what I'm told,
television ratings and fan polls all say our popularity is on the
upswing. Look at this season. The fantastic race for the home run
title with McGwire and Sosa. The Yankees having a record-breaking
season. That is great for baseball. (David) Wells's perfect game.
So many players having great seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important that we capitalize on this. We have to keep
improving our club. This will be a key as we negotiate TV contracts
for the future and build a new stadium. It will be a lot easier
getting people to spend serious money for luxury boxes, preferred
seats, if you are putting a great product on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette and Williams are on solid footing with Harrington. ``I
have tremendous respect for both of them,'' he said. ``Not only on
the baseball side, but the kind of people they are. Dan is
no-nonsense but gets the job done. The middle-level player may not
like him because he has them sitting on the bus waiting to see
where they are going to play. That's why we run 40 or 50 players
through here a year. If they produce, they stay. If they don't, he
moves them out and gets someone else. He's always looking for
someone better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The veterans on our club think a great deal of Jimy. And he
uses them to help him with some of the younger players. Jimy is
tough on younger players. He pushes them hard to get better, and to
work. He does a lot with the players, but in a very quiet way. He
did a great job with our team this year. We played all our guys. He
gave everyone a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   However, not many outside the front offices at Fenway Park gave
the Red Sox a chance to be playing in the postseason.

VAUGHN NOSED AT WIRE IN BATTING CHASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Before Sunday's 6-4 win over the Orioles, Mo Vaughn
seemed at peace with himself and his situation. He was not edgy or
even nervous. He was about to play the last game of the season, a
game meaningless in the standings, but meaningful for a guy who is
supposed to be a slugger and isn't supposed to be vying for batting
titles.
</P>
<P>
   He even asked at one point, ``How far is Bernie (Williams) ahead
of me?'' He was told Williams was at .3360 and he was .3355. So
Vaughn went out and went 2 for 4 _ including his 40th home run _
and finished at .337.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't good enough to finish ahead of Williams, who went
2 for 2 and left for a pinch hitter in the sixth inning to finish
with a .339 average and claim the batting title.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn was not around after the game to speak about his
improbable courtship with the record books. He had a function to
attend and he didn't want to disappoint some kids who were waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, however, Vaughn spoke about the team and how he
handled himself after the last round of barbs with general manager
Dan Duquette had finally subsided. He still had no answers about
the future, except that he wanted to do something about the
0-for-14, seven-strikeout performance in the '95 playoffs that
essentially killed the Red Sox' chances of beating the Cleveland
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   He was heartfelt about this. If this is to be his last hurrah in
a Red Sox uniform, he wants it to be a memorable one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of the way things went after all that stuff came
out,'' said Vaughn. ``I spoke the truth. I said the things I had to
say, and I didn't let it affect the team or the way I played the
game. Since that stuff came out it's been quiet. It's the team
that's important, not me.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn has tried to stay away from talk about this being his
last go-around with the Red Sox. As expected, he said a couple of
weeks ago he was going to file for free agency. But what if the Red
Sox swarm in during the 15-day free agent exclusivity period and
knock his socks off? Vaughn didn't have an answer. All he knew was
he was going to the playoffs, and that had to be his sole focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried not to talk about (this possibly being his last
playoff with the Red Sox), but sure, it crosses my mind that I have
to approach it that way,'' said Vaughn. ``I don't know what's going
to happen. I don't think anybody does. It's important for me to go
into the playoffs and keep our team focused and rise to the
occasion and win this series, and then move on to the next.''
</P>
<P>
   Darren Bragg said the team was well aware of Vaughn's at-bats
and the ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he's a little disappointed because anybody would love
to win a batting title,'' he said. ``I was hoping he would hit 40
home runs and he did. Nobody expected Mo to contend for a batting
title after all he's been through this year. But beyond that, he's
the backbone of this team. He's the one who takes the heat off
everyone else because he's out there answering all the questions
every day. He's the guy everyone looks up to.''
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, after striking out in his final at-bat, Vaughn
received a standing ovation. It didn't seem like Vaughn was trying
to reach on a single; it seemed he was going for another home run.
He had the count 2-and-0 against hard-throwing lefty Arthur Rhodes,
swung and missed for 2-and-1. He took a called second strike, then
Vaughn tried to crank one up to the red Ted Williams seat, and
struck out for the 144th time.
</P>
<P>
   After the ovation, Vaughn seemed to concede the batting title to
Williams, as Mike Stanley replaced him at first base in the top of
the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn had grounded to first in the first inning as the crowd
cheered and stood before his at-bat. In the third, Vaughn fell
behind in the count, 0-2, against Mike Mussina before sending a
fastball over the Sox bullpen _ 425 feet _ with one of those
classic uppercut Vaughn home run swings.
</P>
<P>
   He roped a single over a shell-shocked Rafael Palmeiro in the
fifth inning for his second hit. At that point, he was hitting
.3371 and after Williams had singled in New York, the center
fielder held a slight lead (.3373).
</P>
<P>
   That was as close as Vaughn would get.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know what Williams was doing,'' said Bragg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure somebody did, and I don't know whether Mo knew about
it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn finished with a 16-game hitting streak and 115 RBIs. If
not for Juan Gonzalez's amazing RBI numbers and his carrying Texas
to the Western Division title, and the accomplishments of his Sox
teammate, Nomar Garciaparra, Vaughn would have had heavy
consideration for an MVP award.
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of many teammates, he was most deserving.

 WESTWOOD, Kan.: a share. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Part of the talk of $100 a share has been built around the
widely known fact that Esrey stood to get options for a million
shares of Sprint at the attractive strike price of $47.94 if the
stock reached $95.875. (Sprint's shares ended the week at $77.25 on
the New York Stock Exchange.)
</P>
<P>
   What is not as well known is that Sprint's board recently
changed the terms of those options, so that Esrey could
automatically exercise them in the event of a takeover, regardless
of the stock price at the time. The change would ease a Sprint
takeover by allowing the acquiring company to use an accounting
method known as a pooling of interests, which brings substantial
tax benefits to the buyer.
</P>
<P>
   No matter the accounting method, any acquirer of Sprint is
probably going to have to face some earnings dilution; Sprint's
stock is now trading around 43 times estimated earnings, much
higher than the earnings multiple of the shares of most potential
acquirers.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's high multiple is about to change, at least on the
surface. The main reason that Sprint's stock is trading at such a
premium is that about a third of the company's earnings are being
erased by losses in its wireless venture, an operation that still
requires big up-front investments. But in about six weeks, Sprint
plans to issue a separate tracking stock for its wireless unit,
allowing the market to value that business separately from Sprint's
others.
</P>
<P>
   The tracking stock, however, would not lower another hurdle to
acquiring Sprint. Almost any domestic company that would be
interested in Sprint would probably not be interested in the whole
company.
</P>
<P>
   It is highly unlikely that any of the Bells, for example, would
want the wireless unit, because it would simply duplicate much of
their own existing wireless operations. On the other hand, a big
communications conglomerate that might actually want to expand into
wireless _ say, Worldcom in a few years _ would have little need
for Sprint's long-distance and local businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a separate tracking stock, a company acquiring all of
Sprint could still have to sell the part it did not want _ with
sizable tax consequences.
</P>
<P>
   But the same diversification that could make Sprint a cumbersome
company to buy is also an attribute that enables Sprint to go it
alone for now, and allows Esrey to keep his powder dry for a while
longer.

CROWNING TOUCH: A STAGGERING 70 BY MCGWIRE 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ There were wild-card battles and batting titles on
the line from coast to coast. Chicago Cub Sammy Sosa was in
Houston, involved in both the National League playoff picture and
the Home Run Chase of the Century.
</P>
<P>
   But ground zero was in St. Louis _ home of the Baseball Bible
(The Sporting News), home of those who make the official major
league ball (Rawlings), and home of Mark McGwire, the all-time home
run king.
</P>
<P>
   On the final Sunday of the greatest regular season in major
league history, Busch Stadium was the epicenter, and McGwire capped
baseball's summer of dreams by going over the wall with his final
two swings to finish with 70 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a season I will never, ever forget,'' McGwire told
46,110 red-clad Cardinal fanatics after the 6-3 victory over the
Montreal Expos. ``And I hope it's a season that everyone in
baseball never forgets.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventy. The mind boggles. For 37 years we wondered if someone
could edge past Roger Maris's 61, and then McGwire came along and
topped the record by nine home runs, while Sosa beat it by five ...
and counting. (He has Monday night's important game still to play.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventy,'' McGwire repeated when asked about the magnitude of
the number. ``Oh, it's a huge number. It's unheard of to hit 70
home runs. I'm, like, in awe of myself right now. I think it will
stand for a while. I know how grueling it is to do what I've
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Not since Babe Ruth hit 54 homers in 1920, shattering his 1919
record of 29, has an athlete set an important new standard by such
a huge margin. American Bob Beamon broke the world long jump record
by almost 2 feet in the 1968 Olympics, and Wilt Chamberlain scored
100 points in a single basketball game in 1961, but those were
one-day performances. What McGwire did supersedes anything sport
has seen since the Babe belched his way through the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   The estimable John Updike, in his glowing essay on Ted
Williams's homer in the Kid's final at-bat in 1960, reminded us
that a home run cannot be produced at will. Those who play sports,
and those who write about the games, know this to be true, and yet
McGwire in the last two months made many question the wisdom of the
ages. Big Mac was trying to hit home runs ... and he was hitting
them.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire this year hit an average of one home run every 7.27
at-bats. He trailed Sosa only twice, the last time coming Friday
night when Sammy hit No. 66 and Mac was stalled at 65. (Forty-five
minutes later, McGwire hit No. 66.) Excluding walks, McGwire came
to bat 11 times after Sosa's 66th, and Big Mac homered in five of
those at-bats. His final numbers: .299 average, 70 homers, 147
RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Mercy.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa gets one more chance Monday night. But he's not going to
hit four home runs in a one-game playoff. McGwire is the Home Run
King.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing what I've done this weekend, I'm proud of where I'm
at,'' McGwire said. ``If Sammy and I tied at 70, I'd still be
proud. It was a hell of a ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweaty (91 and humid at game time) St. Louis still was hung over
when McGwire got to the park Sunday. There was not a newspaper to
be found downtown (souvenir-seeking fans bought them five at a time
in the wee hours) and every ATM around Busch was tapped out.
</P>
<P>
   Pregame, McGwire was in an unusually animated mood _ laughing,
joking, and singing in the Cardinal locker room. Clearly, the
pressure was off. He already had a two-homer lead over Sosa and
just one more game to play before flying home to California.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, he hit a broken-bat single off righty Mike
Thurman. Batting in the third, he worked the count to 1-1, then
cranked No. 69 into well-worn section 282 in Busch's lower
left-field grandstand.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's 69th set off a lot of noise at the nearby Trans World
Dome, where the NFL Rams were playing host to the Arizona
Cardinals. The home team was penalized 5 yards for a false start
when St. Louis fans made such a ruckus over the home run.
</P>
<P>
   Take that, pro football. When's the last time a football
development interrupted a major league baseball game?
</P>
<P>
   Thurman was still on the mound when McGwire came up in the
fifth. Fans booed as the count went to 3-0. Knowing that McGwire
had the green light to swing in any situation, and perhaps tired of
playing Washington Generals to McGwire's Globetrotters, Thurman
threw the next pitch at McGwire's helmet. Big Mac got out of the
way and when the inning was over, Thurman was high-fived by some of
his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   This would be an appropriate place to tip one's cap to Expos
manager Felipe Alou. Conspiracy theorists feared that baseball's
sizable Dominican contingent might attempt to help countryman Sosa
and block McGwire's run by walking him. But Alou, a Dominican and
one of the classiest people in baseball, played it straight all the
way. His young pitchers challenged McGwire at every turn, never
taking the cowardly route of pitching around the St. Louis slugger.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, naturally, there was a Red Sox connection. There
always is. It was Sox rookie righty Tracy Stallard who surrendered
homer No. 61 to Roger Maris on the final day of the 1961 season,
and Sunday it was former Sox prospect Carl Pavano serving up No. 70
to McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   With two men aboard and the score tied, 3-3, McGwire faced
rookie Pavano (who was traded for Pedro Martinez, we might add) in
the seventh. McGwire never had faced the ex-Sox farmhand, but he
turned on a low, 96-mile-per-hour fastball and cranked it over the
wall in left, into a private box.

<P>
   For the fifth time in three days, there was bedlam at Busch.
McGwire high-fived three-quarters of the Montreal infield, and the
Expo catcher. Then he did the usual forearm bashes, curtain calls,
pivots, signals, and salutes.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knew that No. 70 would be the last one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am absolutely exhausted,'' he said. ``I don't think you can
use your mind any more to play baseball. I amazed myself that I
stayed in that much of a tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to take longer for the whole season to sink
in. Now I'm going to enjoy my winter and try to understand what
this season was about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe I did it,'' he added. ``Can you?''
</P>
<P>
   No, Mark. We can't believe it, either.

 UNDATED: Scholl said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The grand jury investigation was still in full swing in the
early spring of 1996 when Zeidman, the producer, was assigned to do
the piece, according to Wallace. The Washington Post had, on Feb.
20, published an article that focused on a 1990 cocaine seizure at
the San Diego border and a shortcut inspection program that could
make the task of drug smugglers far easier.
</P>
<P>
   Following up on The Post, Zeidman got in touch with Horner,
according to Wallace. Zeidman, who in a 25-year career has covered
the Olympic Games and has done investigative pieces for various CBS
programs, declined to talk about the events related to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, in a series of recent interviews, said that Horner was
far from the only source for the broadcast, but had been helpful.
``I was skeptical to begin with,'' said Wallace, who flew out to
the border and met with Horner in the spring of 1996. ``Then I
spent some time with him. Reporters can be had, but I didn't feel
that I was being had. Zeidman was spending so much time out there
and developing such a variety of sources that 95 percent of the
story was beyond question.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace added that he felt that Horner ``was genuinely
interested in vindication for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``60 Minutes'' segment used Horner on camera sparingly,
focusing most attention on a former head of a federal investigative
agency; on Feinstein, who has been interested in the issue of
border corruption; and on Jeffrey Weitzman, an officer with the
Customs Service's canine branch.
</P>
<P>
   Weitzman's account, which has never been publicly contradicted,
describes the 1990 attempts of a customs inspector to block
inspections of a gas tanker truck holding nearly four tons of
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a former reporter who is now the Customs Service's chief
spokesman in Washington, said he met Zeidman for lunch in the
spring of 1996 ``and that began roughly a nine-month period where
Lee Zeidman and I were in constant contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jones refused to grant the ``60 Minutes'' team an
interview with the service's commissioner, George Weise. ``This was
going to be one of those `60 Minutes' deer-in-the-headlights
interviews.'' Jones said. ``The show was already going to be
negative. Why make it worse?''
</P>
<P>
   The report was blocked out in rough form by the summer of 1996,
but was shelved after Wallace talked to his former producer, Lowell
Bergman, who had reported on the border on and off for many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I checked out Horner with Bergman,'' Wallace said. ``Bergman
tried to wave me off Horner. Obviously I listened. But we did our
own homework with Horner and some of the other people there in San
Diego.''
</P>
<P>
   Work on the report remained suspended until February 1997, when
The New York Times published an extensive article about border
corruption. Soon afterward, Wallace said, Zeidman went back to
work.
</P>
<P>
   Some time later in 1997, Zeidman stated in legal papers, Horner
provided him with a copy of the disputed memo.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, according to an affidavit that Zeidman filed in the
case, Zeidman called a source on the customs inspection force and
asked him to open a ``Tanker Operations and Procedures Log'' to a
certain page. The source read Zeidman a text identical to the memo
that Horner had provided.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace and Zeidman say they tried repeatedly to reach Weise and
Camacho. Jones, however, said that no interview request mentioned
the memo.
</P>
<P>
   Camacho said he got no such message in 1997. ``There was nothing
on my voice mail, nothing on my staff assistant's voice mail,'' he
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Camacho filed his libel suit in April, a year after the
broadcast, dissatisfied that ``60 Minutes'' had not done enough to
disavow the memo. Informed of customs' findings, the program's top
editor had the correspondent Lesley Stahl read a simple ``update''
reporting the results of the Customs Service's investigation. No
formal correction has broadcast.

JEFFERSON'S ATTITUDE IS CATCHY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Sometimes he just likes to sit in the
middle of a forest and listen to the wind. Sometimes he likes to
sit on his boat in the most remote body of water and fish.
Sometimes he likes to go one step beyond to get the best access to
the prey he is hunting, but ``it's not about killing a duck. It's
about being out there and experiencing nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Jefferson is a little different from the average football
player.
</P>
<P>
   He likes to read. He likes to invest money. He loves to play
football.
</P>
<P>
   But when his career is finally over, he won't be lost in the
forest, or drowning in the river.
</P>
<P>
   At age 29, he seems to have a great outlook on life. He is not
bitter, like some of the men who sit around him in the Patriots
locker room. There is no chip on his shoulder. He's as much of a
regular guy as you'll ever meet. Heck, he doesn't even wear most of
his pads on the football field and yet he's missed only one game in
his eight-year career, when he suffered a concussion vs. Buffalo
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad taught me about hunting,'' said Jefferson, who enjoyed
Sunday's off day, as did the rest of the Patriots. ``I've always
had a fascination with nature. Being somewhere where nobody's been.
I just like going out into the middle of a huge forest where all
you can hear is the wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind has a way of invigorating the soul. You can hear
stories from way back when. That's the kind of stuff you can hear
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he told linebacker Chris Slade just the other day how
much he loves being a football player and how incredibly lucky
people are to be in the NFL. ``I told Chris that we don't live in
the real world.'' he said. ``It's good to sit back and just realize
where we are. Somebody must have prayed for us when we were little
because we've ended up doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson easily could be sulking now, but instead he's
celebrating. After last season, when he bailed out the Patriots by
being the No. 1 receiver in Terry Glenn's absence, he expected to
return in good stead. But through three games he's been almost an
afterthought in the offense. He's been used as the deep man,
basically running a deep corner pattern while quarterback Drew
Bledsoe tries to spot Glenn or Troy Brown underneath.
</P>
<P>
   But he's managed to catch five passes and has an incredible
25.6-yards-per-catch average. Maybe he's been reduced to just a
decoy, but in the process he's left a few corners in the dust by
turning on the speed he still has, though it's probably not the
4.31 40 speed he had in college at Central Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``My role has changed with this offense this year,'' said
Jefferson. ``My role for this offense is pretty much the deep
threat. That's why you're seeing 25 yards a catch. Last year my
role was broad and I was doing many things, and maybe during the
year it will change because once teams catch on to what we're doing
we'll start putting people in different spots. For now, that's my
role.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he's bothered by it, Jefferson winds up saying the
right thing: ``You know ... anything for the team. I've played all
kinds of roles. Whatever makes the team successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson hasn't lost his enthusiasm for doing the right thing.
He's still among the hardest workers in practice, and is considered
a leader on the field. ``I'm just trying to help the young guys
now,'' he said. ``When I came along I was drafted by Houston and
Warren Moon sat me down and talked to me and told me how to go
about being a professional every day. I work hard every day. That
stems from my upbringing, too. I was one of 12 kids and I'm the
next-to-last in the family, and I've had to work hard for
everything. I try to talk to the young guys and tell them what they
need to do to play in this league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on a lot of scout teams (teams that mimic the tedencies of
the next opponent) because I know how important it is to get the
defense ready,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Younger guys, they really don't understand it. They look at it
like I'm here and I'll just go through the motions. It's not that.
You have to go out there and give the defense the right look
because they're going to be facing that on Sunday. And you don't
want to be watching the defense getting scored on and wonder if you
had run that route a little harder whether the defense would have
been better prepared for that. I realize how important the scout
team is.''
</P>
<P>
   These sound like all the traits of a future coach. But Jefferson
is very candid about that. He said, ``I probably couldn't coach
because I probably couldn't deal with the athletes of today. I
couldn't. You have to deal with each athlete different today. Back
when I came up everybody was the same _ you worked hard and did
what you were told to do. Certain players you have to cater to.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Jefferson, who has done internships with local
investment firms, probably will not need to do much of anything
when he retires. He hopes to be the CEO of his own company and
avoid the mistakes he sees others making.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can play for a couple of more years and if the stock
market goes up, maybe I can sit on my boat and catch fish and drink
Mai Tais,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson follows the stock market closely, but hasn't been
devastated by its recent volatility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for the next year or so we're going to see some
volatility in these markets,'' he said. ``We've got some trouble
going on in these foreign markets, especially in Russia. Right now
the bank stocks are taking a hit. But if you're in it for the long
haul, you're bound to dip, but you just hold it. When everybody is
panicking and selling, that's when you want to pick stuff up at
discount prices. I think right now the bank stocks look attractive.
Stocks like Coca-Cola have been taking a hit, because Coke is
global. But it's a good long-term hold, just like the medical
stocks, because people aren't going to stop getting sick.''
</P>
<P>
   And he has some strong feelings about President Clinton's
possible impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should impeach him,'' he said. ``If we did,
we'd see the stock market dip even farther, and I definitely don't
want that to happen. He has a great effect on the market. Since he
became president, he made some people millionaires. Right now, if
you impeach him it would create turmoil. Keep him. Let him serve
his time and then get someone else in there. He's in my prayers. He
made a mistake. I'm not saying we should just sweep it under the
rug, but he's paid for it. I guarantee you he goes to bed every
night wanting to have that moment back.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have any kind of heart, your sympathy has to be with
him. Once he lets the Lord intervene, everything will be all right;
no matter what Congress does, the Lord has the final say about
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson returned home to Jacksonville over the weekend respite
to ``hug my wife and let my two kids beat me up.''
</P>
<P>
   But when he returns, ``I can't wait to get going again. We have
a good team. We're going to go places.'' Jefferson hopes he's not
whistling in the wind.

PRAIRIE VIEW GETS NEW PERSPECTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It began in 1989 with little fanfare. Who cared when a
small, predominantly black school in southeast Texas named Prairie
View lost a Saturday night game to Langston, an NAIA school from
Oklahoma?
</P>
<P>
   Just another school, just another score.
</P>
<P>
   It ended Saturday night with ESPN cutting in for updates. With
players standing on the 50-yard line, crying like babies, telling
of the burden that they and two full recruiting classes before them
had shared.
</P>
<P>
   It is somehow fitting in this year of sports milestones, which
has seen Babe Ruth and Roger Maris eclipsed in a titanic home run
derby by a couple of guys named Sosa and McGwire, Cal Ripken end
his amazing consecutive-game streak, and John Elway finally win a
Super Bowl with the Broncos, that college football come up with its
own compelling drama.
</P>
<P>
   So it was Saturday night in Oklahoma City, where Prairie View
won a football game for the first time in nine years, spanning an
NCAA-record 80 games.
</P>
<P>
   Since Oct. 28, 1989, when Prairie View beat Missisippi Valley
State, every Panthers game had ended the same way _ with a loss,
and in most cases a one-sided one.
</P>
<P>
   The freshman class that came to Prairie View in 1990 went an
entire four years without experiencing a victory; so did the
freshman classes that entered in 1991-94.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, the average margin of defeat was an astounding
42-8. They were shut out 19 times and once lost a game, 92-0.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why there was almost a sense of disbelief as the final
seconds of Prairie View's 14-12 victory over Langston _ a win that
did not come until officials took nearly a minute to untangle the
pile to see if Langston's 2-point conversion attempt was successful
in the final 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The game was full of ironic twists. First, the foe was Langston,
the team that started the losing streak in November 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Second, coach Greg Johnson left Langston two years ago to come
to Prairie View.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over,'' said offensive lineman Kelvin Jefferson. ``It's
been blood, sweat, and tears. People don't know what we've been
through. This takes the losing taste out of our mouths.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for everyone. Consider Langston defensive back Devren
Byerly, who was ruled ineligible to play at Prairie View this
season and transferred to Langston, which as an NAIA school allowed
him to suit up immediately. ``I feel terrible,'' muttered Byerly,
who nevertheless could appreciate the joy of his former teammates.
</P>
<P>
   It was so bad at Prairie View that the players voted not to
speak to the media during the season, no longer wanting to talk
about a streak that became more of a burden each week.
</P>
<P>
   Now that burden is gone, and Prairie View proudly can talk about
its one-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the quietest winning streaks of the season has been
produced by Texas Tech, which is 4-0 after Saturday's 31-24 win
over Iowa State. It is the Red Raiders' best start since 1976, when
someone named  &UR; Bill Parcells  &LR; was their defensive coordinator ...
Then there was Bethune-Cookman 63, Virginia State 57, a game that
took eight overtimes to decide. It was the longest game in NCAA
history ... Forgive Washington quarterback  &UR; Brock Huard  &LR; if he
doesn't want to talk about Nebraska anytime soon. Last year, the
Huskers came to Seattle and knocked Huard out of the game while
knocking the Huskies from the ranks of the undefeated. Saturday,
the Huskers did the same thing in Lincoln en route to a 55-7 romp.
Said Huard, who managed to avoid an injury this time: ``This
stings. This hurts. You want to crawl into a hole.'' ... Nebraska
has a remarkable record against Top 10 teams. The Huskers are 11-0
since losing to Florida State in the 1994 Orange Bowl ... So much
for Southern California's passing offense. The Trojans had a mere
23 air yards in a 31-10 loss to Florida State ... Oregon and
Stanford staged some show, combining for 1,056 yards in total
offense in the Ducks' 63-28 victory ... Despite its 31-30 victory
over Purdue, Notre Dame hardly looks like a Top 25 team. The Irish
weaknesses on defense are obvious, as is their lack of team speed.
``Right now we're not a very good team,'' said coach  &UR; Bob
Davie &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who will see another bad team next week when the Irish
host Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston coach  &UR; Kim Helton &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who didn't like the way UCLA talked
after the Bruins' victory over the Cougars last week, continued to
get his digs in after the Cougars' 42-7 loss to Tennessee.
``They're a lot better than UCLA,'' Helton said of the Vols ...
Georgia Tech's victory over North Carolina in Chapel Hill Saturday
night was Tech's first win there since 1945 ... What kind of job
has  &UR; Mark Whipple  &LR; done at UMass? Not only are the Minutemen
playing exciting football designed to bring fans out, but they're
winning as well. Conversely, what has happened at Harvard? Two
games, two blowout losses? ... Just in case anyone was watching,
Saturday's weather in Miami was warm and sunny. Miami and UCLA
canceled their game Wednesday in fear of Hurricane Georges, which
was lurking in the area. The hurricane went west, and UCLA and
Miami went south. Actually, there's no problem in postponing a
game, but canceling it? Look for wiser heads to prevail and
re-schedule for Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some interesting showdowns are coming up now that we're into
conference races, beginning next week with unbeaten Penn State
traveling to unbeaten Ohio State and unbeaten Georgia facing
unbeaten Louisiana State in Baton Rouge ... Tough year in South
Carolina, where the Gamecocks and Clemson both are having horrible
seasons. South Carolina lost to Marshall a few weeks ago and
Clemson lost to Wake Forest ... Backup quarterback  &UR; Adam Bledsoe
 &LR; completed a 44-yard pass to  &UR; Darrin Chiaverini  &LR; to set up  &UR; Jeremy
Aldrich's  &LR; 31-yard field goal with two minutes remaining as No. 15
Colorado held off upset-minded Baylor, 18-16, in Boulder Saturday
night. Bledsoe, whose brother,  &UR; Drew &LR; , &UR;  &LR; you might be familiar with,
replaced starter  &UR; Mike Moschetti  &LR; late in the third quarter after
Moschetti sprained his right ankle.

DOAK WALKER, 71, A LEGEND TO THE END
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a grim December day in 1949, the SMU Mustangs sat in their
dressing room at the Cotton Bowl and listened to a brief, halting
speech by a young man wearing an overcoat and leaning on a crutch.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker was Doak Walker, the spangled hero who for three
seasons had led them to a succession of thrilling victories, to
championships and national acclaim, and into the very heart and
mind of a nation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on the eve of the biggest game they would ever play _
against a legendary juggernaut that had not lost in four years _ he
had been reduced by injury to the status of spectator. And so, he
spoke, in a voice cracking with emotion:
</P>
<P>
   ``All my life, I have dreamed of playing against Notre Dame ...
now, I can't, but you can. Today, I can't be with you on the field,
but you know that I will be with you ...''
</P>
<P>
   Choked up, Walker never finished the speech. But a teammate, the
late Johnny Champion, once recalled that had someone not
thoughtfully opened the locker room door, the team would have run
through it on its way to the field.
</P>
<P>
   The game was a classic in Southwest Conference history. The
Fighting Irish preserved a winning streak, a national championship
and a 27-20 victory by stopping the Mustangs at the goal line at
the end of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The great heart that carried Walker through 71 years of what he
regarded as a charmed life was finally stilled Sunday. He died in a
Colorado hospital of complications from a skiing accident Jan. 30
that left him paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   But the indomitable spirit that made him a figure of legend was
never more in evidence than during the past eight months, when he
lay flat on his back, hooked to a respirator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really awesome,'' his son, Scott, said yesterday.
``About a month ago, he told a close friend that he had made
himself a promise _ that he would ski again.
</P>
<P>
   ``His attitude, his spirit, were incredible. What had happened
to him was such a shock to us all ... but he just accepted it and
concentrated on trying to overcome it.''
</P>
<P>
   But although Walker's spirits had received a boost when he was
moved from Denver to a hospital in Steamboat Springs, where he
lived, he had gradually lost ground physically.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had developed a bleeding ulcer, which they had treated,''
Scott Walker said. ``He had surgery last week, and there was an
infection, but he's had those before. We weren't expecting this.''
</P>
<P>
   When Walker died Sunday, his wife, former Olympic skiier Skeeter
Werner, and her brother Loris were visiting him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were there, and the nurse told them they needed to check
on the surgery and the infection.'' Scott Walker said, ``so they
went out into a waiting area for a few moments. Then the nurse came
back and told them Doak was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been through so much in the last eight months. I'm just
glad it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker's oldest son, Russ, said, ``I'm still kind of in shock,''
but added that the overall situation had gradually become obvious
to the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been preparing ourselves,'' he said. ``Doak had had
several problems, including pneumonia, and the doctors said there
was a urinary tract infection. And his kidneys had begun to fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I talked to the people at the hospital Friday night, and
they said he was doing fine. So this was definitely a shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had a tough time, but he's in a better place now.''
</P>
<P>
   The place where Walker resided during a storied SMU career and
six years with the Detroit Lions was in the spotlight. Then he
retired and went into business in Colorado. He spent the rest of
his life pursuing, whenever possible, his greatest love _ skiing.
</P>
<P>
   The '49 Notre Dame game, which has remained a classic for half a
century, was to have been the final act of a glittering collegiate
career. But it perhaps said more about Walker than all those
swivel-hipped runs that left would-be tacklers face down in the
grass.
</P>
<P>
   EVERYBODY'S ALL-AMERICAN
</P>
<P>
   It had long been acknowledged that Walker _ three-time
All-American, Heisman Trophy winner, Life magazine coverboy _ could
beat you in any number of ways: running, passing, receiving,
kicking, returning kicks, blocking, even playing defense. On the
last day of his collegiate career, he proved that he could deal a
near-fatal blow to a powerful foe without even suiting up.
</P>
<P>
   But then, it had also long been acknowledged that the personable
Mustangs star was no mere football player: a book that came out a
year after he left SMU was titled simply, Doak Walker, Three-Time
All-American.
</P>
<P>
   In a euphoric postwar era that passionately believed in heroes,
Walker fit the national self-image like a glove. With a nudge from
SMU publicist Lester Jordan, America readily adopted the
unpredictable Mustangs, who befuddled opponents with their
wide-open, pass-oriented attack, then graciously complimented their
victims in a then-customary display of sportsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, fans adopted their leader _ the hero whose
dazzling skills and indomitable spirit usually carried the day.
From the time he teamed with lifelong pal Bobby Layne at Highland
Park High School during World War II to his final year with the
Detroit Lions in 1955 (again teamed with Layne), Walker was a star
who seldom knew failure.
</P>
<P>
   He brought national prominence to a conference that subsequently
entered what has sometimes been called a ``Golden Era.'' To
accommodate the crowds that came to see Walker, the Mustangs were
forced to move from Ownby Stadium on the campus to the Cotton Bowl
in downtown Dallas. That stadium was quickly enlarged twice _ from
46,000 seats to 75,000 _ and came to be known as ``The House That
Doak Built.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the course of those years, Walker built an image that
has endured for nearly a half-century. Perhaps in part because ...
of the millions of words used to describe his greatness, none was
ever uttered by Walker himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing that comes to my mind about Doak,'' says his
famed SMU teammate, Kyle Rote, ``is that he is one of the most
decent people I have ever known. I never heard him say anything bad
about anyone, friend or foe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a great team player and an inspiration to everyone
around him. And I guess `I' was the least-used word in his
vocabulary.''
</P>
<P>
   UNFORGETTABLE SEASONS
</P>
<P>
   During his career at SMU _ which included the three All-America
years of 1947-49 plus five games as a freshman in '45 _ he
accumulated 3,862 yards in total offense and scored 303 points, in
addition to another 1,500 yards in kick returns and nearly 500
receiving yards.
</P>
<P>
   He also punted for a 39-yard average and intercepted 12 passes,
and his coach, Matty Bell, once said that he could have made
All-America as a blocker. He could be shifted back and forth
between all four positions in the Mustangs backfield.
</P>
<P>
   During two injury-free seasons (1947-48), he led SMU to
consecutive outright SWC titles and Cotton Bowl appearances and an
overall 18-1-3 record.
</P>
<P>
   Although he appeared in only five games as a freshman, he played
well enough to be named to the all-SWC team. After spending a year
in the service, he came back for three unforgettable seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In the voting for the Heisman in those years, he won the trophy
once and finished third twice _ including his senior year, when
injuries reduced him to a total of 251 minutes playing time.
</P>
<P>
   But Walker's story is not one of statistics or awards. What set
him apart and created a legend that has endured half a century was
the seeming ability to achieve _ by sheer force of will _ whatever
he wanted to do on a football field.
</P>
<P>
   At 5-foot-11 and 165 pounds, he was considered by many to be too
small to play professional football. He not only played, he is now
in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   He never possessed blinding speed _ although he had a
change-of-pace that could jerk the head off a cobra _ yet he won
many games by outrunning faster players to the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   His fame lay not in the accumulation of overwhelming statistics
but in the eerie ability to somehow rescue a game in the final
moments just when all seemed lost.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of the greatest ``clutch'' players who ever lived,
and possessed the true champion's ability to rise to the occasion.
Throughout his career, he was unfailingly a ``big-game'' player.
</P>
<P>
   Pinpointing this ability, Bobby Layne once said, ``If you were
ahead 28-0, you might as well put him on the bench, because he
wouldn't be worth anything. But if it was 7-7, he's always do
something to win the game for you.''
</P>
<P>
   This ``something'' could be literally anything _ running,
passing, receiving, kicking, or returning a kick. He saved one game
with an open-field tackle, another with a fumble recovery at the
goal line. He won many by simply outsmarting his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having Doak on our team was like having loaded dice or marked
cards,'' a former teammate, Francis Pulattie, once said. ``We just
felt like we had to do our part and Doak would do the rest. The
most amazing thing is that he did it all so effortlessly. He made
it look so simple.''
</P>
<P>
   A prime example occurred on a soggy, mudcaked field at Baylor in
1947. With the Mustangs locked in a scoreless tie and a drive
stalled late in the game, Walker decided that the logical choice
was a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goalpost was about 30 yards away, and we were off at an
angle,'' recalls Bob Folsom, later to become the mayor of Dallas.
Doak just got Gil Johnson to line up as the holder, like there was
nothing to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed that he actually kicked it, because by that time
the ball was so waterlogged and covered with mud, it looked like it
would break your foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole way, it never rose more than three feet above the
crossbar, but he made it. As it turned out, we scored a touchdown a
couple of minutes later after an interception, right at the end of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that field goal is what won it, and I don't think the idea
that he could miss it ever occurred to him.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the only field goal Walker kicked in his college career.
</P>
<P>
   WITNESSES TO GREATNESS
</P>
<P>
   ``Walker,'' an unnamed press box denizen once remarked, ``has
only one specialty _ miracles.''
</P>
<P>
   Grantland Rice called him, ``The most authentic all-around
player in football history.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sports Illustrated put him on its All-Century team in 1969,
the description read, ``Walker did more things well in football,
including win ... than just about anyone who ever played.''
</P>
<P>
   Matty Bell said, simply, ``Some called it luck, others called it
destiny. But Doak had a natural knack for pulling off great deeds.
He was the ideal player and the ideal boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody ever played football like Doak Walker.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the greatest influences on Walker's life was Rusty
Russell _ who coached him (and Layne) in high school and was Bell's
offensive coordinator at SMU, and who essentially recruited him for
the Mustangs.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview shortly before his death a few years ago,
Russell said, ``I always had great admiration for Doak Walker. He
started out as a little kid playing the game because he loved it,
but he always wanted to improve himself and worked at it every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was never big, about 160 to 165 pounds in college, but when
the chips were down you could always depend on him. He was a great
leader ... his teammates always felt that if it could be humanly
done, he could do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the field, he could think 15 yards ahead of himself, and he
was the greatest there ever was at setting up blocks. If you were
out in front of Doak Walker, he would make you look like an
All-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those wild things we did at SMU, people always thought we
had it planned _ but it was just Doak. He ad-libbed, and after
awhile, our kids just drifted into the pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an incredible player _ and a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Born on New Year's Day, 1927, to schoolteachers Ewell and Emma
Walker, he grew up a few blocks from SMU, where as a youth he
watched legendary stars Bobby Wilson and Harry Shuford lead the
Mustangs to the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the same dream that every other kid in the neighborhood
had,'' he said recently. ``To play in Ownby Stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Walker would one day play so well in Ownby that the
Mustangs were forced to move out of it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, the Mustangs moved downtown to the Cotton Bowl, to
accomodate the crowds that followed SMU after he caught a
game-breaking pass over Texas defender Tom Landry in a pivotal
victory of Top 10 teams.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, when he rocked Texas with a 67-yard scoring
run on the game's third play, the Cotton Bowl added 30,000 seats _
to a 75,000 capacity _ to accommodate the increased flow of new SMU
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Gazing down at a Saturday throng in the immense edifice, his
mother once remarked, ``To think, that all this happened because a
little blue-eyed boy could run with a football.''
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN ICON
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1940's, he also became an American icon. When he and
the rest of the Mustangs were featured in a Life Magazine spread in
1948, they became something akin to America's team. They were
young, strong, photogenic, and they won their games in true
Hollywood style _ in the last reel.
</P>
<P>
   Readers who had previously held no particular affinity for
Texans, Methodists, or even football were soon captivated by the
young gents of SMU's fling circus. And particularly, their leader.
</P>
<P>
   As one account put it, some years ago, ``Doak was smart,
handsome, modest and polite. He went to church and Sunday school.
He dated the queen of the campus. His picture was on the cover of
Life and all the sports magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was such a creature as the all-American boy, Doak was
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Expanding slightly on the thought, a later account read, ``Doak
Walker was everything a football hero should be: handsome, shy,
reticent, and unassuming off the field, a cool, swashbuckling
brigand on the field. He was every father's shining son, every
mother's darling boy, every athlete's sturdy leader, every sorority
girl's golden dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no one in the world who could match him. No mortal
could live up to that much adulation, but Doak Walker did. Lord,
how he could play football. He was born to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when it came time to choose a bride, he married the SMU
Homecoming Queen (and Cotton Bowl Queen), Norma Peterson.''
</P>
<P>
   The image was cemented with the publication, in 1950, of the
Doak Walker, Three-Time All-American book by Dorothy Kendall
Bracken, one of his professors at SMU.
</P>
<P>
   And it was an image that stuck ... forever.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, those who were his teammates in Dallas and
Detroit have unfailingly referred to him as one of the most
outstanding individuals they have ever known.
</P>
<P>
   Those who saw him play at SMU have never forgotten it. It was
more than mere skill ... it was as if, somehow, there was magic
involved.
</P>
<P>
   It is notably significant that the last collegiate award he ever
won, in 1949, was the Swede Nelson Award _ for sportsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   It was in that year that Walker, who had led SMU to consecutive
SWC titles and Cotton Bowl appearances and won the Maxwell and
Heisman awards, went through an injury-riddled season culminating
in his being forced to watch the Notre Dame game from the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Walker learned that he was once again being
considered for the prestigious Collier's magazine All-American
team, one of the most coveted awards of its time.
</P>
<P>
   And so, he sat down and wrote a letter to the magazine's
editorial board, which read, in part: ``I deeply appreciate that I
am being considered for the All-American team, even though illness
and injuries have kept me out of the lineup so much of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, I believe there are other All-America candidates who
have seen more action and therefore are more deserving of
consideration. Being selected on the team last year gave me one of
the biggest thrills I ever had in football. I know that the players
selected to this year's team will be just as appreciative of the
honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker signed the letter, dropped it in a mailbox, and went to
class. He never mentioned it to anyone _ his fiance, his coach, his
teammates or his family.
</P>
<P>
   The first anyone at SMU knew of it was when the Collier's
editors, stunned, wrote to Jordan saying they had created a special
addition to the 1949 team: ``Player of the Year for
Sportsmanship.''
</P>
<P>
   In another characteristic gesture of sportsmanship after the
famous Notre Dame game, Walker crossed the field to congratulate
the victors. When he walked into the Fighting Irish locker room, he
received a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   When Walker graduated from SMU and signed with the Detroit
Lions, his coach in a college all-star game stated publicly that
the great Mustangs star was too small for professional football,
and advised him to quit before he got hurt.
</P>
<P>
   As rookie in 1950, Walker led the NFL in scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, with Layne at quarterback and Walker at
halfback, the once-lowly Lions began a run of three consecutive
Western Conference championships and two NFL titles. In the '52
title game, a Detroit victory was cemented by a 67-yard touchdown
run from Walker.
</P>
<P>
   He played six seasons in the NFL and retired after the 1955
season, he said in a recent interview, ``because I found a job that
paid better.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he was one of the highest-paid stars in the league at
the time, Walker said recently that his highest salary was ``about
$35,000.''
</P>
<P>
   LIVING MONUMENT
</P>
<P>
   Walker moved to Denver in 1956 and had been involved in several
business ventures, including ownership of a sporting goods store
and a chemical company. He and his college sweetheart, Norma
Petersen, had four children _ Laurie, Kris, Russell Doak and Scott
_ and were divorced in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 28 years, he had been married Werner and has lived
most of that time in Steamboat Springs.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant peak in the region _ once called Storm Mountain _
was renamed in honor of Skeeter's brother Buddy, also an Olympic
skiier, who was killed in an avalanche in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Walker was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in
1959, and into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 years after his last game at SMU, his image was
resurrected in an era of scandal and a win-at-all-cost mentality,
with the creation of a national award bearing his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doak Walker epitomized leadership, sportsmanship, and academic
and athletic achievement during his storied career at SMU in the
late 1940s'' runs the opening line of the publicity sheet for the
Dr. Pepper Doak Walker Award, first presented in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   It was established to honor an outstanding running back who also
``is in good academic standing, holds a record of good citizenship
and leadership, and exhibits the characteristics of sportsmanship
and fair play associated with Doak Walker.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, not all of the recipients have managed to subsequently
live up to those standards _ but the award remains largely unique
in striving to reward achievements beyond the realm of statistical
superiority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' said the namesake, with a flash of the legendary
disarming modesty, ``I guess one of the best things about it is
that they usually wait until after you're dead to do this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very proud, and very fortunate.''

LEWIS WINS BUT DOESN'T WOW THEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNCASVILLE, Conn. _ How popular is Lennox Lewis? He couldn't
fill up a tent at an Indian reservation.
</P>
<P>
   That was precisely the situation that befell the World Boxing
Council heavyweight champion when he came to the Connecticut woods
Saturday night to defend his title against unknown Croatian
challenger Zeljko Mavrovic.
</P>
<P>
   The Mohegan Sun Casino erected a tent that housed 5,000 seats
for the first heavyweight title fight in New England since Muhammad
Ali stopped Sonny Liston with a phantom punch in one round in
Lewiston, Maine, 33 years ago. Many of the tent's seats were empty
Sunday night when Mavrovic entered the ring.
</P>
<P>
   As things turned out, a late-arriving crowd would have had
plenty of time to get to their seats. But they were smart enough to
stay away. At times, it appeared Lewis and Mavrovic were inclined
to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis went about defending his title well enough to win a
lopsided and occasionally interesting 12-round unanimous decision.
Judge Tom Kaczmarek had it 119-109, judge Bob Logist scored it
117-112, and judge Franco Ciminole had it 117-111, all for Lewis.
The Globe card also had Lewis winning, 117-112.
</P>
<P>
   Had Mavrovic thrown a few more punches things might have gotten
interesting, especially late in the seventh round when he had a
tiring Lewis pinned on the ropes. He drilled Lewis with a right
uppercut and a right-left combination that seemed to trouble the
fading champion.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the extent of Mavrovic's assault. He threw only 298
punches all night, an average of 24 per round, while the champion
was far busier, despite being tired from the third round on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennox was definitely puffing from the third round,'' said
Lewis's trainer Emanuel Steward. ``I can't explain it. He trained
properly for the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumors were he had not and the evidence of his heaving chest and
open mouth from early in the fight belied that. Yet Lewis still
controlled most of the action, landing far more powerful shots far
more frequently and leaving Mavrovic reluctant to move his hands
late in the fight when Lewis seemed vulnerable to attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``He punched and beat me unlike anyone in the world,'' Mavrovic
(27-1) said. ``I thought I'd get him in rounds 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12,
but he was way too strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis (34-1) was particularly effective when he landed to the
body, once hitting Mavrovic so hard with a right to the belly that
the challenger grunted in English and Croatian.
</P>
<P>
   But while Mavrovic was less aggressive than Lewis, Lewis was
less than aggressive, just as World Boxing
Association-International Boxing Federation champion Evander
Holyfield had been a week ago against a similarly inept challenger
(Vaughn Bean). Lewis attributed part of his problems to a strategic
error, claiming he had trained for a different style than Mavrovic
exhibited. The 243-pound Lewis argued that his performance had
resulted from expecting to face an opponent who ran, rather than
stood solidly in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trained wrong,'' Lewis said. ``I expected Mavrovic to run
and he didn't. Some fighters give you a hard time. I was just glad
I adjusted well in the ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis's manager, Frank Maloney, was not glad that a fight he
hoped would end in spectacular fashion droned on to a quiet
conclusion. He credited the chin of the Croatian for some of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mavrovic must have 240 pounds of steel in his chin,'' said
Maloney.
</P>
<P>
   If Mavrovic had a few pounds of steel in his fist, he might have
won the fight, especially in the seventh round.
</P>
<P>
   What Lewis's and Holyfield's performances did was cry out for
them to meet before one loses to a nondescript challenger who holds
no interest to either champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to make Holyfield-Lewis,'' HBO sports senior vice
president Lou DiBella said. ``It's time for Evander to sign the
contract before one of these guys loses to somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis had come into this fight mocking Holyfield's lackluster
performance against Bean and promising to make a statement Sunday
night with his own performance against Mavrovic. If he did, it was
a quiet one.

COWBOYS' `RUDY' NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME AGAINST RAIDERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ That was no postgame traffic jam.
</P>
<P>
   That was 63,544 patrons, rushing to the post office to send
get-well cards to Troy Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, Jason Garrett's Cowboys teammates called him
Rudy, after the overachieving Hollywood walk-on of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   But hold that sequel. Garrett's second start of the season
Sunday in place of the injured Aikman proved to be a real-life,
Sunday matinee bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Six days after he had played mostly mistake-free football
against the Giants in New York, quarterback Garrett combined
crippling sins with general ineffectiveness and squandered one to
the Oakland Raiders, 13-12.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played good in spurts; he played real well in spurts,''
Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said, opting to be kind. ``And he has
some things, I'm sure, that he wishes _ and I wish _ he had done
over.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem was inconsistency. Garrett completed 18 of 33 passes
for 222 yards. But he mostly failed to find the end zone and,
worse, wiped would-be vital points off the board with two bad
throws for interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Abiding Gailey's instructions, he was sacked only twice. But the
Oakland defense rained a variety of blitzes on Garrett, and his
patience betrayed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be a consistent football team,'' Gailey said,
``before anybody can talk about us `arriving.' And we have not done
that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Psst, Rudy. He's talking about you.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, unlike last Monday night in the Meadowlands, Garrett's
supporting cast did not exactly stand up in his behalf. Balls were
dropped. The offensive line had trouble carving a consistent path
for Emmitt Smith, who ran hard.
</P>
<P>
   But Garrett couldn't keep the team moving. The Cowboys had the
ball in Oakland territory on six of their first seven possessions.
They came away with only a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it was a pretty rough day for us, offensively,''
Garrett said. ``We made some errors. Certainly, the two turnovers
hurt a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But let's not mince pronouns. Garrett himself made a horrible
throw to Michael Irvin in the third quarter that turned a cinch,
7-yard touchdown into an end-zone interception.
</P>
<P>
   The defender, rookie Charles Woodson, had been fooled. He was
standing there, alone, when Garrett hurried and threw the pass
right to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fault,'' the Cowboys quarterback said. ``If I had thrown
the ball inside more, Michael would have had a chance to make the
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrett's other calamitous decision came in the final two
minutes. Though the Cowboys only needed a field goal to send the
game into overtime, Garrett, again impatient, misread the Raiders
safety and overthrew a bomb in the direction of . . . Billy Davis?
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the safety had settled in, and I tried to throw a
deep post,'' Garrett said. ``He did a good job of settling and
getting back to make the play.''
</P>
<P>
   But Garrett saw wrong. In the Raiders' locker room, Turner said
he had deep coverage all the way, and when he saw Garrett's
shoulder dip, he knew Jason was throwing long.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, of course, has thrown an interception or two before.
Aikman has also been 1-1 before, which is Garrett's record since
Aikman broke his collarbone two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Troy has the rings. Garrett has, for the most part, only
Thanksgiving Day, 1994, the day he beat the Green Bay Packers and
became forever the Cowboys' ``Rudy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders' lack of respect for Garrett was apparent in the way
that they chose to attack the Cowboys' defense. Quarterback Jeff
George threw only 20 passes and, eschewing the Al Davis tradition,
seldom even looked long.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Raiders' idea was to play it close to the
vest, trusting that Garrett couldn't beat them.
</P>
<P>
   Psst, Rudy. They were right.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett played not only like an NFL backup quarterback, but a
mediocre, seldom-used one. It would not be out of line, therefore,
to criticize the decision, back in April, that made Garrett the
Cowboys' No. 2 quarterback and not Wade Wilson. The veteran Wilson
has won NFL playoff games and been to the Pro Bowl, but Gailey made
the call and anointed Garrett as the backup.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who ended up signing with Oakland and was in uniform
Sunday, would have earned $500,000 this season as Aikman's
stand-in. Garrett was a less-expensive choice with a base salary of
$300,000.
</P>
<P>
   You get what you pay for. Better hold that sequel.

BC WAS OUT OF ITS LEAGUE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON _ If there was any consolation to Saturday's hideous
52-28 setback at Louisville, Boston College's first of the year, it
was that it came against a nonconference opponent. But that was the
only silver lining to the Eagles' worst loss since a 52-20 drubbing
last year at Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles (3-1 overall, 2-0 Big East) have a week off to heal
their wounded _ junior nose guard Chris Hovan (sprained right
ankle) and junior free safety Pedro Cirino (bruised right thigh) _
and analyze all that went wrong against Louisville. BC resumes
conference action Oct. 8 by hosting Virginia Tech in an
ESPN-televised Thursday night game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough nonconference loss to take,'' said quarterback
Scott Mutryn, who completed 19 of 31 passes for 230 yards and a
pair of touchdowns, but threw an interception into the end zone in
the third quarter and was yanked by coach Tom O'Brien midway
through the fourth after fumbling a snap at midfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, in the end, if you're going to take a loss, you're
going to want to take a nonconference loss,'' Mutyrn said. ``The
amount of points they put up and the margin (of victory) is going
to make us remember, and it's going to be a pain in our side until
we play (next) Thursday night.''
</P>
<P>
   It'll take some time for the Eagles to forget the beating they
took in Louisville. Offensively, BC sputtered after committing four
turnovers _ including two fumbles by senior wideout Jermaine Walker
_ that led to three Louisville scores. Defensively, after Hovan
departed the game in the first quarter never to return, the Eagles
were unable to pressure quarterback Chris Redman, who flame-broiled
the secondary in passing for a gaudy 362 yards and a school-record
five TDs.
</P>
<P>
   Redman, the nation's No. 5 passer, seemed to specifically target
BC's young corners, sophomore D.J. Sutton and redshirt freshman
Jonathan Ordway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's a learning experience for them,'' said Cirino, who
injured his thigh in the second quarter, left the game, but
returned in the second half. ``It happens to everyone. It's just
that they were thrown into the fire, but they'll get better.
They're young; they'll get better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't out there most of the game, and that made it tough
for me,'' Cirino said, ``but whatever we threw at Redman, he just
picked us apart. We really couldn't cover anybody, and that's the
bottom line. We've got to work on that, or else it's going to leave
us open for other teams the rest of the season to do the same thing
to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Redman, who had been sacked only once in Louisville's three
previous games, went largely unscathed until redshirt freshman
linebacker Nick Blevins sacked him for a 6-yard loss with 7:52 left
in the game. On the next play, however, Redman threw his fifth TD
on a 27-yard strike to tight end Ibn Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew going in that they were good pass protectors,'' said
junior defensive tackle Mike Willetts, who registered three
quarterback hurries in Hovan's absence. ``I might have squeezed in
there a few times, but it was still too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Another surprise was how quickly BC fell behind, trailing,
31-14, at halftime, and how any attempts at a comeback were so
futile. Redman only added to BC's frustration by converting 12 of
20 third-down attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating,'' said running back Mike Cloud, who
carried 21 times for 124 yards and scored on a 27-yard run that
pulled BC within 31-21. ``On third downs, we'd be getting ready to
go in there and we'd be psyched because there was still time on the
clock for us to put some points up on that board, but then you'd
see them convert _ and keep converting on third down _ and that's
what took it out of us mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   So where does BC go from here? The Eagles, who had Sunday off,
will take another respite Monday, with 25 members of the team
joining O'Brien in a 2 p.m. visit to Children's Hospital. Then
it'll be back to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get as whupped up as we did,'' said Mutryn, ``you
want to prove to yourselves that you're not as bad as a team as you
may have portrayed on that Saturday. We have something to prove to
ourselves this week in practice to get better as a team.''

`AKAGI': YOUNG AT HEART AND CONSIDERING AILMENTS OF THE LIVER
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Dr. Akagi'' is an eclectic footnote to the career of Shohei
Imamura, the septuagenarian Japanese filmmaker whose quirky daring
is currently best represented by ``The Eel.'' That film's novel
conception of a man who reserves his greatest confidences for a pet
eel seems relatively mainstream compared with this. Based on a
novel called ``Dr. Liver'' by Ango Sakaguchi (who was frank about
his drinking and drug use), and set during World War II, ``Dr.
Akagi'' is a bawdy gallows comedy centering on the treatment of
hepatitis. The filmmaker has described this as an homage to his
father, who was a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1945, Dr. Akagi (Akira Emoto) is seen shuttling
comically through a seaside village near Hiroshima, where the
health of his friends and neighbors is generally no laughing
matter. Accompanied by jarringly breezy musical flourishes, the
doctor inhabits an irreverently drawn world that is best
appreciated within the context of other Imamura films like ``The
Ballad of Narayama,'' ``The Insect Woman'' and ``Black Rain.'' This
filmmaker's idiosyncratic blend of frank earthiness, harsh
flippancy, bizarre kinks and flashes of unlikely formal beauty may
not do much to make liver disease riveting. But it does make him,
in his mid-70s, arguably the youngest-hearted filmmaker in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Akagi'' will be shown Monday and Tuesday nights as part of
the New York Film Festival.
</P>
<P>

DESTINY WAS LINING UP OPPOSITE COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ They had played bad enough to lose. They had
also played good enough, yet still lost. No surprise then that
those dazed faces in the Dallas Cowboys' postgame locker room all
seemed to carry a confused look of ``What the heck happened?''
</P>
<P>
   Easy and convenient answer _ Jason Garrett. It's a fast game and
the fall from NFL grace can be even faster. How could a guy from
Princeton fail Decision-Making 101? Besides, Garrett was so smart
just six days ago.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the obvious, meaning a couple of gift-wrapped
interceptions from the arm of Mr. Garrett, Sunday's final outcome,
favoring Oakland by a score of 13-12, almost seemed preordained.
Just ask Deion Sanders, who claims to be involved these days in
divine work.
</P>
<P>
   When Sanders, the fastest football player this side of heaven,
is overhauled from behind on his end zone-bound punt return,
there's a message there somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   And when cornerback Kevin Smith has perfect coverage, and still
ends up burned on a 75-yard TD bomb, the football gods are trying
to tell you something. In fact, the gods are coming in loud and
clear when that pass bounced off Kevin Smith's shoulder pads and
into the arms of receiver James Jett, who had clear sailing ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland scored one touchdown all day, ``and it was that fluke
thing with Kevin,'' said Cowboys defensive coordinator Dave Campo,
shaking his head. Giving up 13 points, Campo's defense provided
Garrett with what he should have needed to survive a career-first,
consecutive starts in the NFL. But no ...
</P>
<P>
   Then again, what about Richie Cunningham and his chili-dipped,
37-yard field-goal miss early in the fourth quarter. Cunningham
being off-target from inside the 40 is unheard of, and a six-point
swing resulted when the Raiders came right back with a field goal,
taking a 13-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   As Troy Aikman heals for at least one more game, the Cowboys had
to provide the overmatched Garrett with tons of extra support. Like
last week in New Jersey. Garrett, of course, has to also provide
self-support, like last week in New Jersey. Neither happened here
Sunday, making this a game the Cowboys were destined to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came in here and stole one from us,'' Campo claimed.
Maybe, but the police report will show it was also an inside job.
</P>
<P>
   In the postgame mingle of players and coaches on the Texas
Stadium carpet, an obscure special-teams player for the Raiders
found himself approached by Dallas' prime minister of prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders wanted to know one thing from third string safety Calvin
Branch. ``He says, ``What are you doing catching me from behind?'
'' smiled Branch, a Colorado State product who hails from the
Houston area.
</P>
<P>
   Deion was 60 yards into an apparent TD run with a punt when
Branch, who had a slight angle, did a Corvette number on Sanders.
``I forgot it was Deion who was running, I just knew I had to catch
him,'' said Branch, who ended up making one of the day's biggest
plays, preventing what would have been a 10-10 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders might have come up end-zone short, thanks to Branch, but
he still left Garrett and Co. at the Oakland 14. Three futile plays
later, Cunningham skunked the 37-yarder, this coming on the
possession after Dallas had first-and-goal at the Raiders' 8-yard
line and Garrett threw an end-zone interception by misreading a
Michael Irvin curl route. Two killer possessions that resulted in
no points.
</P>
<P>
   Chan Gailey usually displays minimal, if any, public emotion.
But Sunday, the frustration was obvious, and if there hadn't been
enough already, Garrett's final throw of the day was the headache
finale for the head coach.
</P>
<P>
   A field goal brings overtime, but needing maybe two short
completions to give Cunningham his redemption attempt, Garrett
threw deep into double coverage for Billy Davis. It was picked off
at the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of time on the clock (1:40), good field position (the
Oakland 43), and Garrett had Michael Irvin open on a curl over the
middle. The attempted throw to Davis made no sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all part of it,'' said Gailey. ``We live with
quarterbacking decision in this business.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, and the Cowboys' offensive line, unable to consistently
spring Emmitt Smith, made Garrett's decisions even more important.
Everyone runs on the Raiders. The Cowboys couldn't and paid for it
when Garrett had to throw to win, a definite no-no.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Sunday's game actually had the two factors Dallas had
hoped for, namely ugly and low-scoring. The Raiders have an offense
capable of fireworks, but the fuse was never lit. The Raiders also
have a quarterback well-known for self-destruction, but Jeff George
was turnover free.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett, however, gave up the football, and then other bad and
unusual things eventually left the Cowboys both confused and
defeated.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Sept. 27, moved Saturday in the `a' category and are
repeated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   MORAL-REVIEW _ President Clinton's admitted immoral behavior has
thrust to the forefront a fundamental question about the meaning of
the American presidency: Should the president be a moral leader?
And if so, what is a moral leader? Contrasting themselves with
Clinton, candidates around the country are declaring that they are
virtue personified. They are emphasizing their families and the
values by which they live. They are making the point, in essence,
that moral leaders are role models. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-TAXES-REVIEW _ Only recently have policy-makers in
Washington, in state capitals and around the world begun to
confront the economic implications of a new retail marketplace that
recognizes no political or geographical boundaries. The issues are
sweeping. Where does a transaction take place when buyer and seller
can be defined to be in multiple locations? Will the borderless
nature of the Internet force governments further down a road that
has already led them to drop trade barriers, harmonize tax policies
and form currency unions? By Richard W. Stevenson. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BIBLE-ADULTERY-REVIEW _ President Clinton has tried to
distinguish between ``sexual relations'' and oral sex. That isn't a
distinction most Americans might make, and it certainly isn't one
the Bible focuses on in defining sexual sin. The Bible does single
out adultery for special attention in the 10 Commandments _ but
defines it in a way that might surprise many people. By Gustav
Niebuhr. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-ENABLERS-REVIEW _ A nation of Clinton Enablers?'' a
headline in The New York Post queried. ``We have all been enablers
for Bill Clinton,'' declared Time magazine. Last week, an editorial
in this newspaper spoke of Clinton's ``documentably dysfunctional
personality'' and warned that ``we must not become a nation of
enablers.'' In a recent speech, the television evangelist (and
sometime Clinton counselor) Robert Schuller asserted that ``we all
share part of the shame'' for stubbornly high public approval
ratings that have enabled Clinton so far to avoid confronting the
problem of his sexual behavior. By Joe Sharkey. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-PUNISH-REVIEW _ By now, virtually no one in the capital
contends that President Clinton shouldn't be punished for his
deceptions in the Lewinsky affair. But what to call the punishment?
By Todd S. Purdum. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SCHOOL-SAFETY-REVIEW _ The American classroom today echoes with
dire warnings about dangers and evils that seemingly lurk
everywhere, from marijuana peddlers to child molesters. The old
notion of sticking to basic education, in the view of some safety
advocates, belongs in a dreamily outdated age of innocent, white
picket-fence childhoods. What good are the three Rs, after all, to
a child trapped in the trunk of an abductor's car, a scenario
actually discussed in some child safety programs around the nation.
By Dirk Johnson. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KURDS-REVIEW _ The Kurdistan Workers' Party, which is fighting
to create a Kurdish homeland in southeastern Turkey, has offered a
cease-fire. The party leader, Abdullah Ocalan, said his forces
would not attack Turkish troops as long as troops did not attack
them. Ocalan's offer, like at least three others he has made in
recent years, fell on deaf ears. The Turkish military, which does
not take orders from civilians, refused to budge from its long-held
view that negotiating with ``separatist terrorists'' is
unthinkable. By Stephen Kinzer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EXERCISE-REVIEW _ Exercise requires metabolism, and metabolism
generates free radicals, those harmful reactive chemicals that
vitamin pills and other supplements are said to combat. The notion
that vigorous sports may actually be bad for you is hardly new or
illogical. Every tale of a former football player with brain damage
or bad knees can reinforce a popular notion that a life committed
to strenuous athletics carries bodily stress to unhealthy levels.
But there is no evidence that exercise in itself reduces life span.
By Nicholas Wade. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FUND-BAILOUT-REVIEW _ Since when does the Federal Reserve Bank
broker a bailout of an investment firm that was a victim of nothing
more than its own bad judgment? An excellent question and one that
policy-makers in troubled nations around the world may well be
scratching their heads over for some time. By Gretchen Morgenson.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-STARR-REVIEW _ The banality of legal: boring in on a
scandal. Excerpts from raw documentary evidence submitted by Ken
Starr.

 BIBLICAL DEFINITIONS OF ADULTERY MAY BE SURPRISING TO SOME

(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, September(The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he went before religious leaders at the White House two
weeks ago, President Clinton admitted to having sinned in his
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   As most people surely know by now, Ms. Lewinsky said in her
grand jury testimony that she performed oral sex on Clinton. At
least once, by her account, their talk apparently touched on what a
Higher Authority might expect from Clinton. That was on May 24,
1997, when Clinton moved to break off the relationship. The
president, she said, seemed to be ``just really wanting to do the
right thing in God's eyes'' and for his family.
</P>
<P>
   But what exactly was the sin he had committed? In his legal
defenses, the president has tried to distinguish between ``sexual
relations'' and oral sex. That isn't a distinction most Americans
might make, and it certainly isn't one the Bible focuses on in
defining sexual sin.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Bible does single out adultery for
special attention in the 10 Commandments _ but defines it in a way
that might surprise many people.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans would probably say that regardless of what
happened between Ms. Lewinsky and the president, he committed
adultery, which they understand to mean breaking the marital vows.
Clinton probably added to that view by making reference at the
prayer breakfast to a passage from the 51st Psalm, a cry of
repentance attributed to King David after the king was rebuked by
the prophet Nathan for having had sexual intercourse with a married
woman, Bathsheba.
</P>
<P>
   But from a biblical standpoint, could the Clinton-Lewinsky
relationship be described as adultery, an act that the Old
Testament defines narrowly?
</P>
<P>
   Or would it be better described under the general term of sexual
immorality, keeping in mind that Scripture is short on specific
references to any number of sexual acts, oral sex among them?
</P>
<P>
   Consider how some modern dictionaries treat the subject.
Webster's New World College Dictionary, for example, defines
adultery as ``voluntary sexual intercourse'' between a married
person and someone not his or her spouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Old Testament is more precise. Leviticus 20:10, which
prescribes the death penalty for adulterers, speaks of a man ``that
committeth adultery with another man's wife.'' So adultery meant
sexual intercourse between a man and a married woman not his wife.
</P>
<P>
   As the magisterial Anchor Bible Dictionary (Doubleday, 1992)
puts it, the man's marital status was ``inconsequential since only
the married or betrothed woman'' was ``bound to fidelity.'' The
prohibition was not so much about a husband's feelings as about
knowing who had fathered a baby. Thus, it worked to safeguard
issues of family succession and property rights.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Rabbi Robert Harris, an assistant professor of
Bible at Jewish Theological Seminary, said that what is considered
morally wrong regarding marital sexual relations has obviously
grown since the Five Books of Moses were written down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live according to an inherited body of tradition, which has
expanded the biblical norms,'' Harris said, adding that
``conventional modern understanding'' of adultery is based on a
broader rejection of marital infidelity. ``We have a more
egalitarian society than the Bible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clergy members say too that the overall sexual ethic expounded
by the Bible demands fidelity within marriage, with no loophole
clauses.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Robert Friday, a professor of religion and vice
president for student life at Catholic University of America, said
that were he to have a talk with Clinton about his relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky, ``I'd say it didn't have to be sexual
intercourse'' to constitute adultery, much less sex.
</P>
<P>
   Oral sex, for example, would be ``a violation of your covenant
promise to Hillary,'' Friday said he would say. ``So, in that way,
it's very much adultery.''
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with Southern Baptist life say it is most
unlikely that Clinton encountered a legalistic approach to adultery
in the Sunday School classes of his youth. ``The Southern Baptist
tradition has meticulously avoided particular biblical references
to human sexuality, and spoken very broadly against pre-marital and
extra-marital sexuality,'' said Robert Parham, executive director
of the Baptist Center for Ethics in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   In the New Testament gospels, some of Jesus' statements are
understood to extend the definition of adultery to include
infidelity by a married man. And the term fornication is broadly
used to describe sexual activity outside marriage, with a warning
of spiritual punishment to come to the unrepentant. In 1
Corinthians 6:9-10, Paul lists fornicators as among those groups
who will ``not inherit the Kingdom of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Parham noted, however, that ``the Bible is not a sex manual.''
The Bible, he said, ``gives us broad values and stories that are to
inform our moral behavior.''

   An immigrant child's harrowing medical crisis ignites a series
of mutual misunderstandings between decent, well-meaning physicians
in Merced, Calif., and a loving family barely removed from their
tribal roots in Laos. ``This fine book recounts a poignant
tragedy,'' Melvin Konner said here last year.

   By Peter Matthiessen. Vintage International, $14.
</P>
<P>
   The author's second novel in a proposed trilogy about the
Everglades is narrated by Lucius Watson, a self-doubting loner who
embarks late in life on a quest to uncover the complicated truth
about his murdered father -- and himself. His research turns up all
sorts of dim facts and slippery memories that gradually reveal a
vast web of kinship involving families whose fortunes and
misfortunes are mirrored in the history of the state. In 1997 our
reviewer, Janet Burroway, called this ``a project of enormous
ambition'' and praised the author's ``perfect ear for the cadences
of Southern speech.''

<P>
   &UR; Bright College Years: Inside the American Campus Today &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Anne Matthews. University of Chicago, $14.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the author witnessed the full-scale canon wars being
fought at the convention of the Modern Language Association; five
years later, she returned to find the wars over and the academics
for the most part happily defanged. ``Matthews is a good
storyteller and reading this book is marvelously soothing,''
Larissa MacFarquhar wrote in these pages last year. A far gloomier
critique of contemporary university life is found in  &UR; Tenured
Radicals: How Politics Has Corrupted Our Higher Education &LR; , by
Roger Kimball (Elephant/Ivan R. Dee, $12.95), a 1990 call to arms
that has been revised and includes a new introduction. In building
his case that the student protesters of the 1960s have become
today's professors of women's studies, homosexual studies and other
newfangled studies, Kimball ``has dished it out beautifully,''
Roger Rosenblatt said here eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pandaemonium &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Leslie Epstein. St. Martin's Griffin, $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   This Hollywood novel set during World War II is populated by
dreamy European exiles caught between the Old World and the New,
between heaven and hell. Its narrator is a fictionalized Peter
Lorre, once a Viennese esthete but now a B-movie actor living on
drugs and possibilities. In 1997 in these pages, David Freeman
admired the ``exuberant mixture of high art and low comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Troublesome Offspring of Cardinal Guzman &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Louis de Bernires. Vintage International, $14.
</P>
<P>
   In an imaginary South American city, a demon-plagued cardinal
tries to save souls by persuading people to get religion and then
killing them before they have a chance to change their minds. In
1994 in the Book Review, James Polk called this a ``wondrous
novel.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Gay Metropolis: 1940-1996 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Charles Kaiser. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $14.
</P>
<P>
   In chronicling the progress of homosexuals in overcoming
prejudice and gaining acceptance, a journalist focuses on New York
City, the main postwar destination for gay people seeking a life
without shame. Last year our reviewer, Phillip Lopate, called this
``a generously stocked'' social history with ``fascinating, curious
side trips.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Chin Kiss King &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Ana Veciana-Suarez. Plume, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   This first novel revolves around a young Cuban-American woman
who turns to her mother and grandmother for support after giving
birth to a handicapped infant. ``Veciana-Suarez's quirky approach
is a great success,'' Jim Gladstone said here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Taking Charge: The Johnson White House Tapes, 1963-1964 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Edited and with commentary by Michael R. Beschloss.
Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $16.
</P>
<P>
   The Lyndon B. Johnson who emerges from this selection of
conversations taped during his first nine months in the Oval Office
is a master of flattery, manipulation and insincerity -- a volcanic
presence capable of both large vision and great pettiness. The book
is ``superbly edited and annotated,'' Alan Brinkley wrote in the
Book Review last year.  &UR; Mutual Contempt: Lyndon Johnson, Robert
Kennedy, and the Feud That Defined a Decade &LR; , by Jeff Shesol
(Norton, $17.95), focuses on the longstanding bad blood between two
feisty figures who sought to control the Democratic Party during a
crucial period. In 1997 our reviewer, David M. Oshinsky, called
this ``a penetrating and richly detailed account.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Girls in the Grass: Stories &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Melanie Rae Thon. Owl/Holt, $12.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 tales in this collection revolve around themes of
despair, guilt, pain and desire, typically expressed in the
yearnings of adolescents. ``The reader is swept along not only by
Thon's remarkable characterizations but also by the taut, magic
current of her prose,'' Constance Decker Thompson wrote here in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Secret Book of Grazia dei Rossi &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Jacqueline Park. Scribner, $13.
</P>
<P>
   This first novel unfolds in the diary of a daughter of a wealthy
Jewish family in Renaissance Italy who discusses everything from
medicine to mysticism in an age of political corruption and
religious intolerance. ``Park has fashioned a dense, sweeping
narrative,'' Lauren Belfer said here last year.

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the non-fiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To, and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)
</P>
<P>
   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending Sept. 19,
1998, at almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000
other retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all
such outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of non-fiction can change from week to week,
reflecting changes in book buying.

   An (x) following a book's ranking indicates that a book's sales
are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A (b)

 DANGER: A TANGLED WEB OF TAXES 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Origianlly filed on Saturday, September(The Week in Review) 
(previously budgeted as INTERNET-REGULATE-REVIEW) 
(bl) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Michael Leavitt was visiting California from Utah a
few months back, and while staying at a beach house used his laptop
computer to shop over the Internet. He accessed a website, made his
selections and charged the bill _ $44.50 plus $2.49 for shipping _
to his credit card.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not pay sales tax. That bothered him because, as
governor of Utah, Leavitt is acutely aware of how reliant states
are on sales taxes. And he has given considerable thought to the
looming problems _ for states, the economy and consumers _ of
relying on traditional tax systems in a world in which Internet
commerce is starting to change the way people shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which states could logically and reasonably have argued that
they should receive the benefits of that tax?'' Leavitt asked about
his purchase. ``California? I was sitting in California when I made
the transaction. New York? New York was where the home page was
resident and where the company was located. But the goods were
packaged and shipped from a warehouse in New Jersey, and they were
shipped to Utah, where I used them.''
</P>
<P>
   Governments have long grappled with how, if at all, they should
regulate the global flow of images and information over the
Internet, seeking to balance concerns about free speech, for
example, with those about pornography. But only recently have
policy-makers in Washington, in state capitals and around the world
begun to confront the economic implications of a new retail
marketplace that recognizes no political or geographical
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Almost by the day, the new medium is showing its potential for
rapid growth. At Amazon.com, the online bookseller, the latest
chapter in President Clinton's woes led to a surge of orders for
the book version of Kenneth Starr's report to Congress and then for
the video of Clinton's grand jury appearance (both briefly topped
Stephen King's latest on the company's best seller list). Catalog
companies are increasingly giving customers the option to place
orders over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a major economic force here,'' said Ira Magaziner,
who heads the Clinton administration's Internet policy team. ``It's
just beginning to reach the consumer, and it's going to be huge.
The question is, how do we create an environment that will allow it
to flourish and also will take care of all the side effects that
will arise?''
</P>
<P>
   The issues are sweeping. Where does a transaction take place
when buyer and seller can be defined to be in multiple locations?
Will the borderless nature of the Internet force governments
further down a road that has already led them to drop trade
barriers, harmonize tax policies and form currency unions?
</P>
<P>
   On a more immediate level, many governors and state legislatures
are convinced that such commerce will present in greatly magnified
form the same problem they have faced for years with the L.L. Beans
of the world that sell by phone and mail from catalogs: Although
consumers are technically liable for sales taxes, companies have to
collect taxes only in states where they keep a physical presence.
Although some merchants collect the tax even where they are not
required to do so, most do not.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble's barnesandnoble.com, another online bookseller,
automatically adds sales tax to orders being shipped to New York,
where it has its corporate headquarters; New Jersey, where it has
its distribution center, and Virginia, where its computer operation
is based. Orders elsewhere go untaxed.
</P>
<P>
   The lost revenue for states is relatively trivial now, but could
mount substantially in coming years as the volume of business on
the Internet grows. Though estimates vary widely, some analysts see
the electronic market growing to hundreds of billions of dollars
annually within the next decade, from next to nothing a few years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   By early in the next decade, states could be losing up to $12
billion a year, according to the National Governors' Association.
That would be a big chunk of state sales tax revenue, which last
year totaled $150 billion, and would be three times what states say
they lose each year because of out-of-state mail-order purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The states are also under pressure from traditional retailers,
who see their Internet competitors as operating in a tax-free zone
that will draw customers away from Main Street and the mall.
</P>
<P>
   From the perspective of technology companies and online service
providers, the issue is whether they will become a tempting target
for new taxes, or the object of discriminatory policies intended to
benefit traditional retailers. A tax free-for-all, they and their
supporters warn, will stifle the new marketplace and deny its
economic benefits to the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is incumbent upon us to get it right so that we do not
allow a feeding frenzy by state and local tax collectors across the
world to turn the information superhighway into an empty
21st-century toll road,'' said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts suggested the problem can be solved by an agreement
among the states to levy taxes based on residence and then creating
software that would automatically add the appropriate amount to any
Internet purchase as part of the credit card billing process.
</P>
<P>
   Such a system could also automatically route the tax to the
proper state.
</P>
<P>
   But getting the balance right between nurturing the new medium
and not hurting states and traditional retailers is no easy
proposition.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, the Senate is debating a bill cosponsored by Wyden
that would establish a two-year moratorium on any new taxes that
would treat Internet commerce differently from traditional
retailing, while establishing a commission to sort out the sales
tax issue. A similar bill passed the House in June.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's increasing interest has made the states nervous.
Some governors fear that the growth of Internet commerce will
encourage the federal government to create and administer a
consistent sales tax system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IRS will say, we'll collect it, and Congress will say,
we'll appropriate it,'' said Leavitt, a Republican. ``We'll have
taxes now collected and spent by local governments collected and
spent by the federal government. That's a massive shift in power.''
</P>
<P>
   Another concern in the technology industry and in Washington is
that other countries could slap duties, tariffs or other trade
barriers on international Internet transactions, either to raise
revenue or protect their domestic industries, and create new taxes
for transactions within their borders. The Clinton administration
has already raised the issue at the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governments around the world are beginning to understand the
power of this medium, and it's something a lot of people are
wrestling with,'' said Ben Boyd, a spokesman for
barnesandnoble.com. ``It's a new medium and you need to look at
everything through new lenses.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The European view of Clinton-Starr
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You need be in Europe only a few days to catch the broad unease
with which not just its leadership but its peoples are watching the
long torment of President Clinton. The virtually certain prospect
that the process will drag on for months, probably even into the
new year, only deepens the distress.
</P>
<P>
   The worry is not so much for Clinton himself, although there is
a good bit of that, but for Europe. Though most Americans do not,
Europeans well understand how crucial a properly functioning
superpower ally is to their own interests.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Europeans have for the most part seen their way
peacefully though the post-World War II years, that they toughed
out the Cold War without going ballistic and that, in the large
European Union, they are on the verge of adopting a common
currency.
</P>
<P>
   Europe fears, and European history recommends the fear, that
without a firm and able hand leading Washington as Europe's caring
international partner, the continent's old habits of fatal
nationalism and its ancient and still unreconciled ethnic
antagonisms would drag Europe into misadventure again.
</P>
<P>
   The recent inability of Europe alone to end the horrors in
Bosnia, until U.S. leadership finally was asserted, renewed the
concern for a new generation.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, much of the press calls for Clinton to step down,
but in the main, European media see l'affaire Lewinsky as, in
effect, an attempt by Congress's Republicans to usurp legitimate
presidential power. As the International Herald Tribune put it,
most Europeans reacted to the release of Clinton's videotaped
testimony ``with revulsion against the public humiliation being
inflicted on the leader of a major democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   European political leadership tends to denounce the media for
supposedly excessive attention to what should be considered a
private matter, but that's political code. Europeans are following
the story almost as closely as are Americans, and with comparable
prurience. Their political leaders sensibly don't want to get
crossways with Congress, but if you substitute ``Congress'' for
``media'' in their comments, you will have the real target to their
disgust.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton came to the presidency unknown to most Europeans.
Was this some provincial who would fumble away U.S. international
leadership and perhaps, if only out of ignorant negligence, abandon
Europe to Lord knows what fate? That he campaigned emphasizing a
domestic agenda added to the anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   But Europe generally has come to see Clinton as a prudent and
purposeful steward of America's unique international
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The economic sump in Asia and Japan's long political dithering
over becoming part of the solution; the destabilizing factional
turmoil in Malaysia; the Serbian brutishness in Kosovo (Bosnia II?)
_ all these and other issues grow potentially more menacing in the
absence of a focused U.S. involvement in their containment, at
least, if not in their solution.
</P>
<P>
   The inability _ in fact, refusal _ of our political system to
come quickly to a clear resolution only exasperates most Americans.
But it is scaring the hell out of much of the world.

26.) IN PRESIDENTS, VIRTUES CAN BE FLAWS (AND VICE VERSA) 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, September(The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's admitted immoral behavior has
thrust to the forefront a fundamental question about the meaning of
the American presidency: Should the president be a moral leader?
And if so, what is a moral leader?
</P>
<P>
   Contrasting themselves with Clinton, candidates around the
country are declaring that they are virtue personified. They are
emphasizing their families and the values by which they live. They
are making the point, in essence, that moral leaders are role
models.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for some politicians, the definition of a moral leader has
little to do with personal rectitude, with fearing God, being
faithful to a spouse or abjuring untruths and devious business
practices. They say the moral leader is the one who seizes upon the
power of high office to enact policies that clarify national ideals
and to inspire the people, summoning society to greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln was famous for both. He steered the nation through the
Civil War, boldly fought to free the slaves and was not bashful
about pressing against perceived public opinion. Personally, he was
Honest Abe, and also a man so modest and unassuming that he wrote
shortly before he was first elected, ``I do not think myself fit
for presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ability to combine personal purity with the political
skills to lead the nation toward larger civic accomplishments has
eluded most presidents. Given the choice, Americans these days
appear willing to put up with a leader who has personal flaws, even
serious ones.
</P>
<P>
   In a nationwide New York Times/CBS News Poll conducted last
week, only 21 percent of the public said it was most important that
presidents serve as moral role models; 65 percent said it was more
important that presidents do their job well.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an ideal world, the president would be the paragon of
virtue,'' said former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, a Democrat. ``The
reality is that no human has been able to reach the ideal of
leadership in which they reflect the best of virtue all the time.
We don't trust politicians to be our moral arbiter. We'd like them
to be. But we don't expect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Mike Mansfield, D-Mont., a longtime Senate majority
leader, argued that there cannot help but be diminished
expectations in an age when presidents face great scrutiny. After
all, today they are expected to reveal the type of underwear they
prefer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when people expected presidents to be
Superman,'' said Mansfield, who is 95. ``But that time is long
gone. The presidency and the people are now being drawn closer and
closer together due to the media. No president is on the pedestal
any more.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean that people no longer yearn for leaders whom
they view as beyond reproach. Still, most people probably look for
the qualities that they most desire at the moment. With the economy
humming along and the nation secure, there is probably no special
demand for inspiring leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Graff, a professor emeritus of history at Columbia
University, said ``the wheel of history has to turn fortuitously''
for a president to have the opportunity to exhibit moral
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know whether a person is a moral leader unless they
have something to lead for,'' he said. ``Wars and depressions are
good places to show off leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Hoover, for example, was so scrupulously honest that he
did not collect his salary as president. (He was also a
millionaire.) But his efforts to be a moral leader were spoiled by
the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few presidents who is widely regarded as a true moral
leader during a time of peace was Theodore Roosevelt, who from his
``bully pulpit'' preached again and again about honesty in
government.
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk of integrity, some people may not be more
comfortable with a president who commands the same personal respect
as, say, a member of the clergy. To reach the highest elective
office, a person, no matter how upright in public, has to be a
master at the inherently devious game of politics.
</P>
<P>
   A common perception is that politicians who are too clean may
find it too distasteful to do some of the unsavory things that a
president must do, like outmaneuver political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't necessarily want them to be Mother Teresa _ We don't
necessarily want them to be pure as can be,'' said Thomas Cronin,
an authority on American presidents who is also the president of
Whitman College in Walla Walla, Wash. ``The world of international
affairs requires a toughness of demeanor.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a rich history of presidents who, personally, were
viewed as beyond reproach but never accomplished much for the
country. Just the same, presidents considered rogues are viewed as
successful moral leaders.
</P>
<P>
   While known for his Christian principles, Woodrow Wilson's
naivete in dealing with the European powers helped set the stage
for World War II, and his off-putting aloofness disposed the nation
to elect the more genial, and flawed, Warren Harding as his
successor. After Harding's death in 1923, his vice president,
Calvin Coolidge, succeeded him and restored respectability to a
White House blackened by Teapot Dome and other scandals. ``Cautious
Cal'' was a New England Calvinist known for his morality, honesty
and frugality. But he was also conspicuously shy, a wooden speaker
and failed to win passage of much of his legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, John F. Kennedy has been remembered for having
endless trysts. While his unfaithfulness wasn't generally known at
the time, his virility enhanced his stature then and, more
important, still does to some extent today. Lyndon B. Johnson,
himself no exemplar of marital fidelity, had an admired reputation
for effective leadership that owed much to the fact that he was a
dirty political infighter.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever questioned the uprightness of President Gerald R.
Ford or his successor, Jimmy Carter, who in the 1976 campaign
presented himself as an antidote to the dishonesty of government in
the Watergate era. ``I don't intend to break a single promise,'' he
vowed in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all his trustworthiness, Carter was never able to parlay
his personal character into effective championing of larger
societal values during his tenure. And neither Ford nor Carter has
been viewed as particularly effective presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Just about any president would be considered downright charming,
and virtuous, if compared with Andrew Jackson, a dictatorial,
nasty, temperamental man who always seemed to find himself facing
down an opponent in a duel with a pistol. But that did not prevent
Jackson from earning a place in history as a respectable president
symbolizing abiding national values.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And Franklin D. Roosevelt, the president viewed by many as
America's most effective moral leader this century _ revered even
as he forced Americans to make huge personal sacrifices in the
Depression and in World War II _ was hardly a role model in private
life. He engaged in a years-long clandestine affair with Lucy
Mercer, a former social secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Decades later, Richard M. Nixon, in his first inaugural address,
tried to muster the American spirit by invoking God repeatedly and
declaring, ``We can build a great cathedral of the spirit.'' Nixon,
of course, became the first president to be forced from office
because of ethical misdeeds, although many people still insist that
he was an effective leader, particularly in foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Moral leadership is often in the eye of the beholder. Mansfield,
for one, said he considers Harry Truman the last true moral leader
in the White House because he combined high ethics in his private
and public life. Yet despite the moniker ``Honest Harry,'' Truman
never could completely shake off the taint of his ties to the
suspect Missouri political machine of Tom Pendergast. And Truman
was not particularly popular when he was president; only recently
have historians portrayed him as a heroic figure.
</P>
<P>
   William Kristol, a Republican whose magazine, The Weekly
Standard, promotes the view that moral leadership is more than
personal conduct, said Ronald Reagan was the last truly moral
leader. ``Reagan really had a certain personal dignity,'' he said.
``It was a great moral achievement of Reagan that he won the Cold
War. And that depended on his having his own personal moral
grounding in his belief that he really was right.''
</P>
<P>
   But others cited Reagan's poor relations with his children and
contrasted his expressions of devoutness with his failure to attend
church regularly. ``He could make the lofty statement on the beach
on the anniversary of D-Day,'' Graff said. ``But there was a
feeling that there was something not quite real about him. He
didn't stand 20-feet tall.''
</P>
<P>
   The most blatant distinction between a president's personal
morals and public values was drawn by Democratic National Committee
national chairman Steve Grossman speaking, as Clinton looked on, at
a recent fund-raising event in New York. ``Mr. President,'' he
said, ``it seems to me that you have demonstrated, at least in my
adult lifetime, a higher commitment to the kind of moral leadership
that I value in public service and public policy than any person I
have ever met.''
</P>
<P>
   That tribute was hotly disputed by Republicans; even some
Democrats in the room at the time rolled their eyes. With
characteristic understatement, former Sen. Bob Dole, who was
defeated by Clinton in the 1996 campaign, said, ``The DNC chairman,
I think, went overboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, and even many Democrats, these days prefer the
definition of a moral leader as a role model. Republican Party
officials contend that the personal values of candidates have
eclipsed everything else as the most crucial issue in the November
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle, who is considering a run for
the White House in 2000, volunteered on national TV recently that
he had not had an extramarital affair. At a convention of the
Christian Coalition the other day, another Republican contender,
Steve Forbes, allied himself with Teddy Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been drawn to him because he understood the enormous
power of the American presidency to shape our culture, not simply
through the force of laws but through the power of persuasion,''
Forbes said of Roosevelt, adding, ``Like Ronald Reagan, he had a
compass and a core.''
</P>
<P>
   But the danger of campaigning on moral authority is that
Republicans risk being viewed as considering themselves
holier-than-thou. ``There has to be a very delicate calibration in
calling for moral leadership without appearing to be haughty or
self-righteous,'' said Ralph Reed, a Republican strategist and the
Christian Coalition's former executive director. ``The challenge is
more on the Republican side to affirm rather than condemn, to
elevate right behavior rather than attack wrong behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   When Carter ran for president, he did not repudiate Nixon and
Ford as much as he tried to promote the general healing of the
nation. Some Republican strategists said they feared that Sen. John
Ashcroft, R-Mo., who may run for president in 2000, was skating at
the line of appropriateness when he said, ``We have a president who
views a vulnerable woman from the perspective of a predator.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself was asked the other day if he had the moral
authority to lead the nation. ``That is something you have to
demonstrate every day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That will not be easy. ``He was probably at his peak when he
could stand up and talk about family values,'' said Leon Panetta,
Clinton's former chief of staff. ``Now it would not be wise for him
to talk about values except in the sense of contrition and the
personal pain he's been through.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even if he avoids the subject, kindling a national debate
over morality in government may be Clinton's lasting legacy.

 IN FINANCE, THE BITTER MEDICINE IS FOR OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, September(The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Do as I say, not as I do.
</P>
<P>
   That was the message in the extraordinary rescue last Wednesday
of a prominent but speculative investment firm called Long-Term
Capital Management. The rescuers, rallied by none other than the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were a consortium of Wall Street
brokerage firms and major banks.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital, a four-year-old firm founded by John
Meriwether, a former vice-chairman of Salomon Brothers, found
itself on the brink of bankruptcy last week after most of its
multibillion dollar bets in world stock and bond markets had gone
bad. The firm had lost more than $4 billion; the deal to save it
required a cash infusion of $3.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Since when does the Federal Reserve Bank broker a bailout of an
investment firm that was a victim of nothing more than its own bad
judgment? An excellent question and one that policy-makers in
troubled nations around the world may well be scratching their
heads over for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because a Fed-sponsored bailout of a speculative investment
fund doesn't track with the medicine U.S. policy-makers have been
dispensing to financial institutions in distress around the world.
Japan, for example, whose banking system is near collapse, has been
told repeatedly that tough love is the answer to its predicament.
If a bank is insolvent, let it fail and move on. Just say no to the
Japanese convoy system, in which healthy banks prop up their
unhealthy brethren.
</P>
<P>
   The same has been said to apply to Russia, where the
International Monetary Fund's refusal to bail out the economy last
summer is another good example of the widespread belief that nobody
should be considered too big to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Come closer to home, however, and the story changes. Long-Term
Capital was a fund aimed at wealthy individuals and institutions _
minimum investment: $10 million. It had borrowed enough money from
the banks and brokerages it did business with to have a portfolio
of trades worth $120 billion on capital of roughly $4 billion: Too
big to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that exactly one week prior to the near collapse of
the firm, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, the chief bank
regulator in the nation, testified to Congress that the problems in
the Asian economies were the result of laxity on the part of
lenders there. Greenspan said that banks and financial institutions
that are in trouble should be helped carefully so as not to
encourage further reckless lending. ``Any temporary financial
assistance must be carefully tailored to be conditional and not
encourage undue moral hazard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing at a high school in Washington on Friday, Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin spoke about the investment firm debacle. He
said: ``This is not a bailout; there's no public money. It was a
decision by the private sector that their economic interests lay in

 THE STARR EVIDENCE: THE BANALITY OF LEGAL _ BORING IN ON A
SCANDAL

<P>
   The raw evidence made public last week in the presidential sex
scandal was a turnoff to many people in more ways than one: Not
only was it wince-inducing, thanks to its subject matter, but it
was also yawn-inducing, thanks to its sheer length and volume. This
curious fact undoubtedly occurred to those who fidgeted through all
four-plus hours of deposition verite starring Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But the videotape wasn't the half of it. The accompanying,
3,100-page document-drop by the House Judiciary Committee (to be
followed by a far bigger one this week) included numerous
excursions into the tedious, the mundane and the irrelevant. Yep, a
lot of this is real forehead-bouncing-on-the-table material, folks,
and some of it is unintentionally funny.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing this out is not to judge whether the evidence, over
all, is compelling or not. Rather, the tedium is a reflection of
the legal and procedural rigamarole that is so much a feature of
modern American life.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's on display for all to behold, and writ large, in the
struggle between Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and the White
House. Evidence follows.
</P>
<P>
   _ By TOM KUNTZ &QR;
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Exhibit A: Profiles in penmanship. On May
28, Monica Lewinsky, her lawyer William Ginsburg and her father,
Dr. Bernard Lewinsky, were escorted by government agents up to the
17th floor of FBI headquarters in Los Angeles so she could give
handwriting samples to investigators. As noted in a memo from
Starr's office, it was a complex process. And it didn't go
smoothly: (END ITALICS HERE)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pens used for this examination were as follows: one Bic,
round stic, medium, black ink pen; one Paper Mate pen with black
ink; and one Paper Mate gel writer, with black ink. At various
times during the examination, LEWINSKY was asked to use one of the
three different pens. LEWINSKY's attorneys interrupted the
examination on numerous occasions so LEWINSKY could consult
privately with her attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   MONICA LEWINSKY was first asked to write the alphabet in its
entirety, with three different pens, on an 8{'' x 11'' sheet of
paper (unless specified otherwise, each sheet of paper used was
8{'' x 11'') attached to a pad. On the same sheet of paper,
LEWINSKY was asked to write the number 1 thru 10, three times,
using a different pen each time.
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY was then asked to perform the same task, this time
using a sheet of paper resting only on the desk where she was
sitting.
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY was then asked to print her name three times on a sheet
of paper attached to a pad, each time using a different pen.
LEWINSKY was then asked to sign her name on a sheet of paper
attached to a pad, each time using a different pen. LEWINSKY was
then asked to perform the same task, with the sheet of paper used
resting directly on the desk.
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY was then asked to sign her name to a photocopy of a
blank check. At that time, GINSBURG objected and advised his client
not to sign the form. GINSBURG advised that the OIC (Office of the
Independent Counsel) would need to get a court order before his
client would sign anything that resembled a check. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The handwriting examination continued until approximately 10:06
a.m., when LEWINSKY took a break to visit the restroom. . . .
</P>
<P>
   At approximately 11:00 a.m., the examination ended, at which
time GINSBURG was served grand jury subpoena number D-1319 for
LEWINSKY's appearance on June 4, 1998, in Washington D.C., to
provide handwriting exemplars. GINSBURG advised (that) he thought a
handwriting examination was just completed. GINSBURG was advised
that all requested exemplars were not provided; therefore, LEWINSKY
would have to come to Washington D.C., to do so.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Exhibit B: The ``dribble glass.'' In her
grand jury testimony on Aug. 20, Ms. Lewinsky was about to vent her
anger at President Clinton for giving away one of her gift ties to
his steward, Bayani Nelvis. But then her drinking cup started
leaking, eliciting this exchange involving Michael Emmick, an
associate independent counsel, and an unidentified grand juror:(END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   JUROR: Can you tell me what your thoughts were when you saw the
pictures of Nelvis wearing the first tie that you gave the
President?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Yes. Actually, you know what? I think my cup's
leaking. I'm sorry.
</P>
<P>
   JUROR: Do we have another cup up there?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Am I allowed to know people's names in here?
</P>
<P>
   MR. EMMICK: The answer to that is no.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Oh _
</P>
<P>
   MR. EMMICK: I know it seems _
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: It's so awkward.
</P>
<P>
   MR. EMMICK: It does seem awkward, but I think it's better if _
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: OK
</P>
<P>
   MR. EMMICK: _ the record not have any identifications.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: OK
</P>
<P>
   MR. EMMICK: We didn't intentionally get you a dribble glass.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Oh, sure. At least it's water and not grape juice.
</P>
<P>
   I had two very different thoughts. My first thought was, ``You
jerk''. . . .
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Exhibit C: Answering machine blather. Many
of the phone messages left for Ms. Lewinsky at her Watergate
apartment, and transcribed by Starr's office, seem relevant to the
case. Others ramble on in pretty ordinary fashion:(END ITALICS
HERE)
</P>
<P>
   CHRIS (no last name given): Hi, Monica. It's Chris here. I guess
about 8:00 a.m. your time on Saturday morning. I was just ringing
up to say thanks so much for the brilliant Pentagon, um, sweatshirt
that I'm going to have a lot of fun wearing here in the winter
months.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, I won't get beaten up by any, um, anti-American
leftists _ leftists, so that we'll have to wait and see. But
anyhow, it was a really nice present. Thanks so much for that.
</P>
<P>
   And um, well, I hope you can get on the e-mail soon because I
miss, uh, our little e-mail chats, not to mention the jokes. I
haven't heard a good joke, except for some John Denver jokes, in
quite some time. So, anyhow _ and Sonny Bono jokes too, which is
rather crass. I got a Sonny Bono joke next day, which is terrible.
</P>
<P>
   Anyhow, uh, I'll, um, hope to be hearing from you soon. OK
Ta-ta. Bye-bye.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Exhibit D: Name that date. Linda Tripp's
recordings of her phone conversations with Ms. Lewinsky
(transcripts are expected this week) were originally not dated. So
Starr's office had to deduce when the tapes were made, and provided
painstaking written explanations:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Conversation (NU)3:
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Oct. 4, 1997 . . .
</P>
<P>
   The conversation that immediately precedes this conversation on
the tape occurred on Friday, Oct. 3, 1997. At the end of the
previous portion, Ms. Lewinsky notes that it is 10:20, that she is
going to sleep, and she indicates that she is not working the next
day. . . . This conversation begins with Ms. Lewinsky describing
her trip to the Potomac Mills Mall for the day. . . . The placement
of the conversation on the tape and the day-long trip to the mall
are consistent with a weekend day.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ms. Lewinsky says Betty Currie was in the office
during the morning because of the Radio Address. . . . The
President delivered a Radio Address on Saturday, Oct. 4, 1997,
10:06 a.m. Also, Betty Currie rarely works on Sunday because it is
her ``church day.'' . . . Ms. Lewinsky further says she wants to
buy the President a gift because he now had a hearing aid. . . .
The President was fitted for hearing aids on Oct. 3, 1997. See
``Age Catching Up With Clinton; He's Getting Hearing Aids,'' Sandra
Sobieraj, The Associated Press, Oct. 3, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky also says there are three months before the
beginning of the year, and she refers to sunglasses she bought the
President for his Latin America trip. . . .
</P>
<P>
   These factors are consistent with a conversation on Oct. 4,
1997.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Exhibit last: The lunch bunch. The
presidency may be at stake, but people have to eat. At Ms.
Lewinsky's Aug. 6 grand jury deposition, Deputy Independent Counsel
Solomon Wisenberg checks to see if the food has arrived:(END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   MR. EMMICK: I have no more questions about this date, and I look
at the time and it looks like it's 12:30.
</P>
<P>
   THE FOREPERSON (unidentified): Sol, I think, went to check on
something.
</P>
<P>
   MR. EMMICK: Oh, all right.
</P>
<P>
   THE FOREPERSON: Did you check on something for lunch?
</P>
<P>
   MR. WISENBERG: I have checked. It is here. It's been here.
</P>
<P>
   MR. EMMICK: OK All right. Well, if this would be a good time to
break for lunch _
</P>
<P>
   THE FOREPERSON: Hourlong.
</P>
<P>
   MR. EMMICK: OK
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: OK
</P>
<P>
   THE FOREPERSON: OK
</P>
<P>
   MR. EMMICK: Thank you.
</P>
<P>
   (Whereupon, at 12:34 p.m., a luncheon recess was taken.)
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)When those assembled reconvened after lunch,
Ms. Lewinsky had a suggestion:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Time for a nap? . . .

<P>
   THE FOREPERSON: . . . Monica, I'd like to remind you that you
are still under oath.

T HIS IS PUNISHING: NAME THAT PENALTY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By now, virtually no one in the capital contends
that President Clinton shouldn't be punished for his deceptions in
the Lewinsky affair. But what to call the punishment?
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment is the constitutional process of review by the House
of Representatives and trial by the Senate, and Congressional
Republicans have made it clear they intend to forge ahead, though
David Letterman cracked that the president wonders whether he could
just maybe be ``peached.'' There is also censure, a ritual shaming
not specified in the Constitution, but applied to President Andrew
Jackson and later revoked.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is ``censure-plus,'' an invention first floated by
the former Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos and others, in which
the president would pay some financial penalty as well. But
Washington Post columnist E.J. Dionne complained that censure-plus
sounds like a detergent _ and constitutional scholars say it may
not be legal in any case.
</P>
<P>
   There is sanction, which is also financially punitive, but
sounds like an economic embargo on a rogue state, and besides,
Clinton has already run up some $6 million in legal bills.
</P>
<P>
   There is resignation, but that is what Republicans feel about
Clinton's determination never to leave office voluntarily, not the
president's own plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if you call it `Impeachment with Oak Leaf
cluster,' or `Son of Censure' it won't make a whit of difference,''
said former Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., who now heads the Institute
of Politics at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.
``We're right back to the same four things, and those are called
pride, honesty, truth and respect, and the stain is not on the
dress but on our national fabric.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For an outstanding athlete to die at age 38, her world records
still unbroken, as Florence Griffith Joyner did last week, is a
blunt reminder that fine physical condition is no guarantee of
longevity.
</P>
<P>
   As when the runner and author Jim Fixx died at 52 of a heart
attack while jogging 14 years ago, an athlete's early death raises
the question of whether too much exercise strains the heart or
other parts of the body, like running a machine beyond its
endurance levels. After all, exercise requires metabolism, and
metabolism generates free radicals, those harmful reactive
chemicals that vitamin pills and other supplements are said to
combat.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that vigorous sports may actually be bad for you is
hardly new or illogical. Every tale of a former football player
with brain damage or bad knees can reinforce a popular notion that
a life committed to strenuous athletics carries bodily stress to
unhealthy levels.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no evidence that exercise in itself reduces life
span. The truth seems to be that athletes who die young, in
general, have perished from one of the usual causes of premature
death. (Drug use is one.)
</P>
<P>
   Hard exercise, unfortunately, seems to be rather good for the
body, however much pain and perspiration is involved. Doctors in
ancient times believed that vigorous exercise was harmful. And even
though the Italian physician Bernadino Ramazzini of Modena observed
in 1700 that fleet-footed messengers were healthier than sedentary
tailors and cobblers, the orthodox medical suspicion of heavy
exercise was not dispelled until the 1930s. That was when
physicians concerned about the health and longevity of university
oarsmen in England and America found to their surprise that the
oarsmen were living longer than the general population.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent studies have yielded mixed results. Professional
baseball players were found to live no longer than the average Joe.
But Finnish endurance athletes lived six years longer than average
conscripts and power sportsmen an extra year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Faster. Farther. Better.
</P>
<P>
   The present advice from health authorities that we should all
exercise more rests largely on a continuing survey of 52,000 men
who entered Harvard or the University of Pennsylvania between 1916
and 1950. The survey, by Dr. Ralph Paffenbarger of the Stanford
University School of Medicine, shows that men who exercise hard and
regularly tend to live longer.
</P>
<P>
   Expending 2,000 calories a week in vigorous activity _ the
equivalent of jogging or walking briskly for 20 miles _ bought a 25
percent reduction in the chance of dying during the study period,
Paffenbarger has found. The effect was progressive at least up to
3,500 calories (35 miles) a week.
</P>
<P>
   Can the body actually wear out from excessive exercise? ``We do
not find any hazardous level of exercise,'' Paffenbarger said,
though he noted that even the most vigorous athletes in his study
tend to exercise less as they grow older.
</P>
<P>
   Star college athletes who have become sedentary live no longer
than anyone else, Paffenbarger has found. But men who take up
exercise later in life appear to gain the same benefits as lifelong
exercisers. Paffenbarger's rule of thumb is that for each hour of
vigorous physical activity, you get an extra two or three hours of
life.
</P>
<P>
   That may not seem so great a deal, but exercise affects more
than just the quantity of life. It also improves its quality by
making people feel healthier. It lowers the heart rate and blood
pressure, increases the high density lipoprotein in the blood and
decreases the low density lipoprotein. All of that is known to be
good for the cardiovascular system.
</P>
<P>
   Many people lack the time or inclination to jog 20 miles a week,
and health experts _ rather than delivering sermons they know will
be ignored _ have taken to preaching that even moderate exercise is
good. Though Paffenbarger's figures provide no evidence that
moderate exercise prolongs life, moderate exercise produces the
same kind of cardiovascular changes, though to a lesser degree, as
occur in vigorous exercise. Thus it seems a reasonable bet that
moderate exercise is better than none.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Fixx took up running because his father died of a heart
attack at 43; he himself lived until age 52. It's sad that any
athlete should die in the prime of life. But without all that
physical activity, death might strike even more prematurely.

 JUST SAY MAYBE: SECOND THOUGHTS ON COPS IN THE CLASS  
(The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Welcome back to school, children. Lesson No. 1: The world is a
dangerous place, filled with creeps, poisons and predators. Beware!
</P>
<P>
   The American classroom today echoes with dire warnings about
dangers and evils that seemingly lurk everywhere, from marijuana
peddlers to child molesters.
</P>
<P>
   The old notion of sticking to basic education, in the view of
some safety advocates, belongs in a dreamily outdated age of
innocent, white picket-fence childhoods. What good are the three
R's, after all, to a child trapped in the trunk of an abductor's
car, a scenario actually discussed in some child safety programs
around the nation. (The recommended response: Unhook the taillight
wires to alert the police.)
</P>
<P>
   Among the many worries of parents, illegal drugs rank near the
top. In declaring a virtual war on drug abuse, Americans have
responded for more than a decade with drug-education programs that
cost hundreds of millions of dollars and consume precious classroom
time.
</P>
<P>
   By far the biggest of these efforts, Drug Abuse Resistance
Education, or DARE, is used in about 70 percent of the nation's
public schools and has generally won overwhelming approval from
students, parents, teachers and the police officers who conduct the
classes. DARE, which relies on workbook teaching and promotes
kinship with the police, is one of about 50 antidrug and safety
campaigns in schools.
</P>
<P>
   There's just one problem: these programs generally don't work.
</P>
<P>
   Several studies have found that children who attend
drug-education classes are just as likely to use illegal drugs as
students who do not participate.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, officials of nonprofit drug prevention programs have
dismissed the studies with claims that the findings were colored by
the political agendas of academics and researchers. But the latest
study, released early this year, was conducted by Dennis Rosenbaum,
a professor who had been a DARE supporter, and was financed by the
Illinois State Police, a champion of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Among other discouraging findings, this study found that DARE
has even unwittingly encouraged some young people to try drugs,
especially students in the suburbs, according to Rosenbaum, a
criminal justice professor at the University of Illinois in
Chicago. DARE has defended its results and points to endorsements
from many school districts.
</P>
<P>
   School-based anti-drug programs remain popular despite such
findings, though an increasing number of skeptical voices have been
raised. A number of cities have even quit DARE, including Oakland,
Omaha, Spokane, Wash., and Fayetteville, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Wysong, an Indiana University professor at the Kokomo
campus, whose research has found DARE programs to be ineffective in
curbing drug use, said people were starting to become ``a little
less enthusiastic'' about the program.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of drug-education efforts say students learn
quickly that they are being given a message _ and that a message is
different from education. Moreover, if students come to see any
part of an anti-drug campaign as propaganda, they tend to distrust
the entire message.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these concerns, Wysong said, critics find it difficult
to speak out. ``You leave yourself open to charges that you're not
on the team in fighting this plague,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-drug programs often go far beyond warnings about illegal
drugs, alcohol and cigarettes, teaching children to be wary of
unfamiliar adults and giving them specific game plans for escape.
</P>
<P>
   During the weeks before Halloween, for example, many parents
will be warned about the risks of trick-or-treating, and virtually
all of them will be told not to let their children eat anything
that isn't factory-wrapped. For many parents, giving a shiny red
apple to a child on Halloween nowadays is about as thoughtless as
offering a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents and child psychologists have raised concerns that
children are being scared needlessly, noting that kidnappers hiding
in the bushes are actually exceedingly rare. But such cases are the
stuff of made-for-television movies and lurid accounts on local
newscasts. The fact is that children are far more likely to be
abused by a family member.
</P>
<P>
   Drug-education programs have also raised some concerns among
civil libertarians, who feel uneasy about classrooms being turned
over to uniformed police officers. In the case of DARE, a question
box sits in the classroom during the program, so children can talk
anonymously about anything _ including the drug-taking habits of
friends or family members.
</P>
<P>
   The DARE officer will not listen to specific allegations, but
instead encourages the children to report such activity to a school
official. And when a child goes to a teacher or counselor with
knowledge of such drug-taking _ for example, a parent who smokes
marijuana _ the school is bound to go to the legal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Loren Siegel, director of public education for the American
Civil Liberties Union, said the organization had no official
position on programs like DARE.
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, ``Anything that encourages surveillance _
reporting on your family members or friends _ cannot be good for a
democracy.''

   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Few spectacles in recent decades have been as
breathtaking as the historic handshakes between government leaders
and chieftains of insurgent groups. From Central America to Israel
and from South Africa to Northern Ireland, these scenes, which for
years or decades were unthinkable, have shattered old assumptions
and opened up new futures for long-suffering groups of people.
</P>
<P>
   In each of these places, politicians and generals spent years
denouncing rebel leaders as terrorists and swearing never to
compromise with them. It was not easy for them to change their
minds, considering the images of bombings, murders and tearful
funerals that even now burn in their memories.
</P>
<P>
   Now two more of the world's rebel armies, watching the
breakthrough in Northern Ireland from opposite corners of the
European land mass, have called unilateral cease-fires and declared
their willingness to talk peace. But the two approaches have met
with diametrically opposed reactions, and the difference is
revealing.
</P>
<P>
   In Spain, a cease-fire announced by the Basque separatist group
ETA set off a political earthquake. Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
cut short a tour of South America to rush home. Interior Minister
Jaime Mayor Oreja appeared live on national television to say that
while he was uncertain of the ETA's sincerity, he welcomed the
cease-fire with ``happiness and relief.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Time will be the judge of the sincerity, authenticity and
depth of this decision,'' Mayor Oreja said. But he added, ``While
there is a truce, there will be no tragedy, no deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   At almost the same time, the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which is
fighting to create a Kurdish homeland in southeastern Turkey, also
offered a cease-fire. The party leader, Abdullah Ocalan, said his
forces would not attack Turkish troops as long as troops did not
attack them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been fighting for years, and now we have chosen
peace,'' Ocalan told journalists by telephone from an undisclosed
location. ``We should be given a fair chance in politics. If we are
given this chance in a democratic way, we will give up our arms. We
are ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan's offer, like at least three others he has made in recent
years, fell on deaf ears. The Turkish military, which does not take
orders from civilians, refused to budge from its long-held view
that negotiating with ``separatist terrorists'' is unthinkable. A
government spokesman said the cease-fire offer was ``not to be
taken seriously.'' Soon afterward the army launched a major
offensive in which it said 53 insurgents died.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not abide by the truce we declared,'' Ocalan said as
he announced a resumption of his violent campaign. ``We will
intensify our attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   The ETA campaign in Spain has cost nearly 800 lives over 30
years. Savage as it has been, it is dwarfed in scope by the Kurdish
war, which has taken more than 28,000 lives in 14 years. Some might
imagine that the toll Turkey has paid would make its people
war-weary, but in some quarters it has had the opposite effect.
Nationalist groups are powerful here, and they would explode in
anger at any hint of a negotiated settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish generals believe that negotiating would be a form of
surrender, and would constitute intolerable disrespect to soldiers
who have been killed over the years. They also fear that since
Kurdish rebels are supported by Syria, one of Turkey's principal
enemies, any concession to them would be seen as a sign that Turkey
is vulnerable to pressure from hostile powers.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurdish conflict has hurt Turkey economically, because it
costs the army an estimated $8 billion each year and thus feeds one
of the world's highest inflation rates; socially, because it has
sent hundreds of thousands of refugees streaming from the war zone
into big cities that are ill-prepared to receive them; politically,
because it forces the government to restrict democracy by banning
parties that advocate Kurdish nationalism; internationally, because
it gives Turkey the image of a warlike nation unwilling to follow
the path of reconciliation. And all the while, it hardens hearts on
both sides and leads people to accept bloodshed and terror as
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important reason Spain and Turkey responded so
differently to cease-fire calls is the difference in their form of
government. Spain is a full democracy in which voters can choose
any party and political platform. Turkey is a semi-democracy in
which the military makes final decisions on key questions of
national security.
</P>
<P>
   Although a new group of commanders took over control of the
Turkish military last month, there is no hint that their resolve to
carry on the Kurdish war is weakening. Even urging them to change
their minds is considered close to treason. Politicians or
journalists who describe the insurgents as authentic
representatives of the Kurdish people, or who call for a negotiated
end to the conflict, risk prosecution and imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, one Turkish politician who is a pillar of the
establishment, Husamettin Cindoruk, broke ranks and urged the
military to consider a solution along the lines of Northern
Ireland's. Skeptics suggested that Cindoruk, a conservative who
heads one of the three parties in the coalition government, was
just trawling for Kurdish votes. Still, his words amazed many
Turks.
</P>
<P>
   If other mainstream political leaders begin speaking like him,
pressure may build on the military to re-examine its approach to
the conflict. So far, however, that seems inconceivable. For the
moment, the only hope for peace talks here comes from the example
of other countries. After all, it was for years inconceivable that
Irish nationalists would join their longtime enemies in a new
assembly, or that Yasser Arafat would shake hands with an Israeli
prime minister, or that the leader of South Africa's apartheid
regime would embrace Nelson Mandela as a partner.
</P>
<P>
   There is, too, the example of Nicaragua, where, in the
mid-1980s, the Sandinista interior minister, Tomas Borge, vowed,
``Before we talk to the contra leaders, rivers will flow uphill
from the seashore to the mountains, and the sun will rise in the
west and set in the east.'' Two years later, Contra and Sandinista
leaders stood together on a makeshift stage, joined in singing
their national anthem, and signed a treaty ending their war.

 `ENABLING' IS NOW A POLITICAL DISEASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, September(The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By JOE SHARKEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A nation of Clinton Enablers?'' a headline in The New York
Post queried. ``We have all been enablers for Bill Clinton,''
declared Time magazine. Last week, an editorial in this newspaper
spoke of Clinton's ``documentably dysfunctional personality'' and
warned that ``we must not become a nation of enablers.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent speech, the television evangelist (and sometime
Clinton counselor) Robert Schuller asserted that ``we all share
part of the shame'' for stubbornly high public approval ratings
that have enabled President Clinton so far to avoid confronting the
problem of his sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The American electorate has been called many things from the
pulpit and in editorial pages. ``Enabling, to describe the behavior
of a nation, though _ that's a new one,'' said Dr. Stanton Peele,
an author and clinical psychologist who has studied what he regards
as the two-decade-long march of the therapeutic ideal and its
clinical concepts from personal behavior into ever-wider areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've developed a tendency in America to describe every
personal transaction in clinical terms,'' he said. ``So I guess, in
the spirit of our times, if you're applying a clinical label to all
unwanted behavior, you could apply the label `enabler' to people
who continue to support Bill Clinton.'' The term has recently been
applied to those close to the president like Hillary Rodham
Clinton, Betty Currie, his secretary, and his friend Vernon Jordan.
(Grand jury testimony from the latter two is expected to be made
public this week, so watch for it to crop up again.) But when
commentators and clerics start using enabling to describe behavior
by the general electorate, ``we're entering a pretty rarefied
realm,'' said Peele.
</P>
<P>
   Some find it hard to suppress a chuckle. ``A whole nation full
of enablers? Is anyone treating it? What an opportunity,'' joked
Tana Dineen, a psychologist in Ontario and the author of
``Manufacturing Victims: What the Psychology Industry Is Doing to
People'' (Robert Davies Multimedia Publishing, 1996).
</P>
<P>
   Enabler is a noun used in clinical and support-group settings to
label someone who is close to (and often diagnosed as clinically
``co-dependent'' with) an alcoholic or other presumed addict, and
whose love and emotional support allow the sufferer to deny the
addiction and avoid seeking treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The clinical concepts of co-dependency and enabling began
flourishing in the early 1980s, when employee health insurance
coverage was widely expanded to cover treatment for addiction and
other mental health problems. Best-selling self-help books, intense
media coverage and lobbying by therapists soon widened the range of
what were considered to be clinical addictions _ compulsive
gambling, shopping and sexual behavior among them.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, enabling has gradually moved from the clinical
to the cultural vocabulary, said Peele, who in 1989 decried what he
called America's ``treatment binge'' in ``The Diseasing of America:
Addiction Treatment Out of Control'' (Lexington Books). Now, he
said, the term seems to be metastasizing again _ into the civic
vocabulary of politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're enablers because we haven't risen up to demand that
Clinton seek clinical treatment,'' he said. ``That's a pretty
whimsical concept.'' In Vogue
</P>
<P>
   As a purported disease, sex addiction is in vogue. Though not
yet classified as a specific disorder in the American Psychiatric
Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, it is being widely
treated as a compulsive disorder in proliferating sex-addiction
support groups and clinical settings. In print and on television,
leading sex-addiction therapists routinely assert that as many as
70 percent of American men suffer from some form of diagnosable
sexual compulsion. And as with in any clinical addiction, it is
concurrently assumed that a significant number of a non-confessed
sex-addict's loved ones, acquaintances and even co-workers are
``enabling'' the denial to seek treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Asserting that the American public is ``enabling'' Clinton's
behavior is ``sort of the equivalent of describing the entire
American society as being addicted or clinically co-dependent,''
said Peele. ``Does that mean that all of America now has to enter
therapy?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, in a manner of speaking, replied Dr. Jerome D. Levin, a
psychotherapist and the author of ``The Clinton Syndrome: The
President and the Self-Destructive Nature of Sexual Addiction''
(Prima Publishing, 1998). The book argues that Clinton is a
clinically addicted sex addict in denial who has been ill-served by
the enabling behavior of family and associates.
</P>
<P>
   The president, suggested Levin, who trains alcohol- and
substance-abuse counselors at the New School for Social Research in
New York, should ``put aside the spin doctors and lawyers,'' invoke
the 25th Amendment, and enter a ``rehab program'' for addiction
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president were to drop his denial and get appropriate
help, then I think the public would finally come to realize that in
supporting him, whatever other valid reasons we might have had for
that support, we were in fact enabling his behavior, in a way
similar to a wife who stays in a destructive relationship with an
alcoholic.''
</P>
<P>
   Laughing, Levin added: ``Then, if you really want a reductio ad
absurdum, the president could return to work and invoke the
Americans with Disabilities Act, meaning he couldn't be fired for
his disability. It would drive the right-wing lunatic fringe
nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   But the increasingly pseudo-clinical tone of the discourse on
Clinton's problems is dismaying to Wendy Kaminer, the author of
``I'm Dysfunctional, You're Dysfunctional: The Recovery Movement
and Other Self-Help Fashions'' (Addison Wesley, 1992), a book that
skeptically described the intervention of therapy into ever-wider
areas of social behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Posing the question, `Are we enabling him to continue his sex
addiction?' presumes that there is in fact such a thing as sex
addiction,'' said Ms. Kaminer. ``More importantly, it presumes we
are all collectively engaged in a personal relationship with the
president. We are not. It's a political relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``To even ask that question is a measure of how much the
therapeutic culture has distorted the political culture,'' she
added. ``It's a terrible distraction from the questions we ought to
be asking about what's really happening to the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, she said, ``People are much more knowledgeable
about popular therapy and pop psychology than they are about
politics,'' and are thus are more fluent in the jargon of pop
psychology than in the vocabulary of civics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all love to gossip and we love to personalize
relationships. We love soap operas. It's hardly a coincidence that
of all the Clinton scandals, which are arguably more serious
business, the one that has really resonated has been the one about
sex.''

   PAKISTAN AND INDIA MAKE NUCLEAR TEST PLEDGE
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan and India promised to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban
treaty, which bars nuclear testing. Both countries have some
reservations, however, and both have prime ministers with wobbly
political bases. And India's military ambitions under a Hindu
nationalist government remain unclear.

   U.N. WARNING TO SERBS
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations Security Council ordered Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to stop Serbian attacks on civilians in the
ethnically Albanian Kosovo region, and demanded that both sides
start talking. In sending its warning, the Council _ minus China _
papered over big differences about whether outside military
intervention will be necessary to stop the Serb-dominated Yugoslav
army from attacking civilians while battling Albanian separatists.
</P>
<P>
   The Council is using the same tactic against Saddam Hussein of
Iraq, putting on a common front to prevent troublemakers from
exploiting divisions among the most powerful nations. The hard part
is deciding what to do if the bluff fails.

   PENTAGON'S POLICY ON GAYS IS UPHELD
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has declined so far to take up the
constitutionality of the military's ``don't ask, don't tell''
policy. But the court may get another opportunity after a ruling by
a federal appeals court, which said the policy does not violate
homosexuals' rights.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, which said free speech and equal protection have
traditionally been more curtailed in the armed forces than in
civilian life, upheld the military's recent policy allowing
homosexuals to serve if they keep their sexual orientation a
private matter.

   POVERTY RATES FALL
</P>
<P>
   In a welcome bit of good news for the Clinton administration,
the Census Bureau reported that the proportion of Americans living
in poverty declined last year, a drop largely attributed to
progress made by black and Hispanic families.
</P>
<P>
   The overall rate was 13.3 percent in 1997, down from 13.7
percent the year before. Clinton said the statistics vindicated his
economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   READING TEA LEAVES
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan and Keizo Obuchi have almost nothing in common.
Except that the Federal Reserve chairman and the new Japanese prime
minister both enjoy reputations for making public comments that
leave investors puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   What investors heard from Greenspan last week was a slippery
statement that, ``We have to bring the existing instabilities to a
level of stability reasonably shortly'' before the global economic
turmoil really rocks America. The world immediately assumed that
the Fed will cut interest rates on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Obuchi. Before meeting President Clinton in New
York to discuss Japan's banking crisis, he said, ``Instead of `too
little too late' we want to deal with this in ways that people say
`too big, too fast.'''
</P>
<P>
   Even Clinton's economic team had a hard time faking much
optimism at those words. ``You have to remember, we've been in
office six years and we've already met six Japanese prime
ministers,'' one noted.

   NEW EMBASSY FUNDS SOUGHT
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration asked Congress for $1.8 billion for
emergency safeguards to protect the country's 260 embassies and
consulates. The spending, if approved, would nearly double the
total amount lawmakers have appropriated for security since 1985,
and reflects the administration's conclusion no overseas mission is
safe from terrorism since the embassy bombings in Kenya and
Tanzania last month.

   RUSSIA AND IMF SQUARE OFF
</P>
<P>
   Russia and the International Monetary Fund have never liked each
other, but now neither side is hiding it. The new Russian
government declared that unless it got more aid from the IMF it
might default on its international obligations. The IMF said that
it wouldn't tolerate ``blackmail,'' and that if Russia wants loans,
it might think about collecting some taxes and turning off the
printing presses that are spitting out rubles and creating
hyperinflation.

   McDonald's, it's safe to say, has changed the world, imprinting
cookie-cutter standardization on the global psyche. Now Joan Kroc,
the widow of Ray Kroc, who made McDonald's into a golden-arched
juggernaut, is using a few of her millions to try to change one
corner of the world, donating $80 million to the Salvation Army for
a community center in inner-city San Diego.

   NASA SEEKS A RUSSIAN BAILOUT
</P>
<P>
   The biggest science project of all time, a sprawling outpost for
astronauts, is to start being hauled piecemeal into orbit in two
months. But the plan is shaky because a key Russian player has been
crippled by the nation's economic chaos.
</P>
<P>
   So NASA plans to buy up to $660 million in goods and services
over five years to help its partner complete a key station element.
Congress hates the plan. But the alternatives _ including dropping
the station, on which the Americans have already spent billions _
are unappealing.

   Kenneth Ginter was stuffing handfuls of quarters into a coin
redemption machine in a Waldbaum's supermarket in Queens, New York
City. In fact, the authorities said, he had put 1,086 quarters into
the machine and had 295 more quarters in his pockets when the
police emerged from the aisles to arrest him. The quarters, they
said, came from the city's parking meters.

   SMUT? NOT IN THIS MAN'S ARMY!
</P>
<P>
   Military stores at bases around the world began pulling from
their shelves more than 150 magazines that the Pentagon decided are
sexually explicit.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy survived the cut. But lesser-known periodicals like
Kinky Fetishes, Barely Legal and D-Cup, were sent packing _ brown
paper wrappers and all _ banished to what the Defense Department
called its ``adult sophisticate'' list.
</P>
<P>
   The Military Honor and Decency Act, imposed by Congress two
years ago, bars the military from selling in its stores any film,
video or publication that ``depicts or describes nudity, including
sexual or excretory activities or organs, in a lascivious way.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentagon was blocked from carrying out the law after a
lawsuit was filed by Bob Guccione, the publisher of Penthouse
(which is on the banned list), who argued that the legislation
violated freedom of speech. Guccione's effort failed earlier this
year when the U.S. Supreme Court refused to review the case.
</P>
<P>
   That cleared the way for the Pentagon to start yanking offending
titles from store shelves. And while it's not yet on the banned
list, some lawmakers say the Whitewater independent counsel's
445-page report, with all its sexually explicit material, would
almost certainly qualify.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Starr report would not pass this test,'' said Rep. Roscoe
Bartlett, R-Md., who wrote the bill. ``I can't believe military
mothers would want their 10-year-old's reading it.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is saying that GIs can't buy reading material like
Naughty Neighbors or Nude Readers' Wives anymore. They just can't
buy them at base commissaries or exchanges.

   MAYBE IT'S JUST A COINCIDENCE ...
</P>
<P>
   For conspiracy theorists, the grassy knoll is already passe, as
is the identity of Deep Throat. But what about those new $20 bills
the Treasury Department started shipping last week _ 2 billion of
them _ with the oversized mug of Andrew Jackson?
</P>
<P>
   President Jackson, of course, was the only occupant of the White
House to be censured by Congress. Surely, there must be a
subliminal message here, one aimed at the millions of Monica-weary
Americans who will start pulling the new bills out of ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, introducing the
bills, DID say, ``Look at your cash and pay more attention to its
feel and appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   While you're looking, don't forget the vast West Wing
conspiracy. The reverse side of the bill shows the north side of
the White House, which faces Pennsylvania Avenue, instead of the
south side, which graced the old bill. The engravers carefully
cropped out the president's offices in the West Wing, to say
nothing of the Northwest Gate, where, according to Kenneth Starr's
report, Monica Lewinsky once threw a fit.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the Treasury says it began designing the new
bill in June 1986, during the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a job for Oliver Stone.

   1. BAMBOO: THE MAGIC AND MYSTERY OF THE GIANT GRASS Though
Western civilization has been slow to discover its incredible
qualities, bamboo helps provide a living for nearly half the
world's people. Actually a giant grass, bamboo is the most richly
varied, the most widespread, the fastest-growing, the most used,
the most environmentally friendly, the best-represented -- but also
the most puzzling of plants. Over the past 3,000 years, the Chinese
have discovered more than 1,000 uses for bamboo, which is amazingly
strong and resistant despite its light weight. Now Western
scientists, architects and furniture-makers are slowly beginning to
catch on to the ``miracle grass.'' By Rolf Bokemeier. From GEO
magazine. 2,000 words. (English translation available.) 2. ON THE
KIBBUTZ, DIRTY HANDS AT LAST By abandoning socialism and embracing
capitalism, Israel's signature institution is bringing itself back
from the dead. The kibbutz may survive, but will it still be a
kibbutz? By Ze'ev Chafets. From The New York Times Magazine. Full

prominent American proponent of Freudian analysis, answers
questions such as what makes Freud so incendiary a century after he
started writing; does Freudian analysis involve giving up free
will; and why should someone choose psychoanalysis over drugs,
alternative medicines or yoga? By Ken Adelman. Washingtonian

INFECTION Early in life, almost everyone picks up a dose of the
Epstein-Barr virus. Most of us will never even notice. During
adolescence, a few will suffer the effects of infectious

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: When hurricane warnings aren't enough
 &HT;    (For release Sept. 30, 1998)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A friend called to say that with hurricanes at least we
have warnings; she, out in California, has no such luxury with an
earthquake. An interesting point, but an argumentative one.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, we in the Hurricane Belt do have warning. Despite that,
can you hold a hurricane at bay? It does what it wants to with
whatever is in its way. All society can do is moderate the damage.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way to really prepare for wind gusts of 170 mph, or
tide surges of 20-or-so feet such as the Gulf Coast received with
Hurricane Georges, or the area south of Miami received with
Hurricane Andrew in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   While those of us in the United States _ through stricter
building codes, zoning laws and a growingly responsive Federal
Emergency Management Agency _ have gained ground on reducing the
human toll of hurricanes, others have not.
</P>
<P>
   Understand that the Hurricane Belt is huge, extending from the
Lesser Antilles all the way to southeastern Texas. The headlines in
recent days have been of material damage to the Florida Keys and
the Gulf Coast, but the news before that had to do with the loss of
hundreds of lives in Caribbean countries.
</P>
<P>
   A house, in Biloxi, Key West or Port-au-Prince, can be rebuilt.
A lost human life cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Georges was a unique storm since it ripped through the
spine of the Caribbean, from Puerto Rico to Hispaniola to Cuba
before going on to the U.S., oblivious to mountain ranges and
hoped-for changes in direction that never came.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a monster storm when it traversed those land masses.
Yet the loss of human life was horrific. In the Dominican Republic,
deaths attributed to Georges topped 200; in Haiti, it's at 87 and
counting.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to claim that these countries are backward and, thus,
incapable of creating an infrastructure that would be more
protective of human life. But topography plays a major role.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere in hurricane-vulnerable sections of the United States
are there mountains. In the Caribbean islands struck by Georges,
the mountain ranges were the killers. They sent torrents of water
down into small villages, into creeks and rivers to rage
downstream, and to destroy lives.
</P>
<P>
   No manner of warning, no satellite picking up signs of a
tropical wave off the Cape Verde Islands, can prevent that from
happening once it becomes a hurricane and stampedes over a
Caribbean island.
</P>
<P>
   For the people of those islands, there is no escape route _ no
interstate upon which to flee in another direction. The hurricane
practically covers the island and, besides, the highways aren't
there.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, some improvements can cut down on the death toll. In
Haiti, it was claimed that government gridlock was a reason why
many of the canals, stuffed with silt, were not cleared to prevent
inland tidal waves.
</P>
<P>
   In the 70 years since more than 2,000 people were killed by a
hurricane in the vicinity of Florida's Lake Okeechobee, the death
toll from hurricanes in the U.S. has dropped sharply. This is not
the case in the Caribbean, nor, I suppose, will it ever be.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the need for financial and materialistic
post-hurricane assistance to the people of those islands _
including Cuba _ arises with each storm that batters them. It is
inevitable, unavoidable. It is a part of living there, every bit as
dangerous, and unmanageable, as living on California's San Andreas
Fault.

   The entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well in both large and
small businesses, reports Times writer Louis Uchitelle in this
cover feature. It's certainly a prime competitive weapon in big
business. Witness Merck &AMP; Company, the giant pharmaceutical
corporation, whose scientists are encouraged to scout outside the
company for promising new research that might lead to a future
drug. Then there are the millions of Americans who believe that the
entrepreneurial spirit resides mainly in small companies with fewer
than 100 employees. Here, self-employment is a big phenomenon,
particularly among workers who have been laid off by corporations.
Uchitelle is a staff writer for The Times.

   John Shoch, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, scans the room

software hackers who are seated. Shoch is doing what he does best:
``surfing,'' or looking for the next big thing in the nation's
technology heartland. What will it be? Is it wireless data? Is the
time finally right for interactive digital television? John
Markoff, a staff writer for The New York Times, reports on the
blinding pace of Silicon Valley and what seems to be everyone's
pastime _ catching the next big wave. Markoff is co-author of the
book ``Takedown: The Pursuit and Capture of America's Most Wanted

   It may not be easy to spell, but entrepreneurialism is all the
rage among potential MBAs. Driven by student and alumni demand, no
field is hotter today in business studies. Whereas a generation ago
the goal of top MBA graduates was to join a Fortune 500 company and
climb the corporate ladder, students' most fervent desire nowadays
seems to be to come up with a marketable idea, start a company and
work for themselves. Ethan Bronner, national educational
correspondent for The New York Times and author of ``Battle for
Justice: How the Bork Nomination Shook America'' (Norton, 1989),
explains why in this feature.

   Ken Hakuta's story is inspiring. He's the inventor of the Wacky
Wall Walker, those slime-covered plastic creatures that ooze down
vertical surfaces. The beauty of it is that Hakuta didn't even come
up with the idea: All he did was license the toy from Japan for a
tiny fraction of the amount he made. Now he's a millionaire! There
are a ton of ideas out floating around, reports Neil Strauss. But
who has the time _ and money _ to make them happen? Strauss
doesn't, which is why he is giving away his top 10 get-rich-quick
schemes in this humorous feature for those who want to pursue them:
portable baby sitters ... address books, cell phones and wallets
that beep when they're lost ... public egg banks. Strauss is a

   When Bettina Richards was an artist-and-repertory executive for
big recording companies, she didn't like the way they treated
musicians. Her favorite bands were ignored if they weren't best
sellers; one lead singer, who went on to make a gold album, was
told he shouldn't be singing at all. In 1992, she started her own
company: Thrill Jockey Records. It would release music she cared
about and let the musicians decide what to release, how to package
it and run their careers. A profile by Jon Pareles.

   At age 10, Harold S. Blue, now the chairman of Proxymed Inc., a
health-care information-services company, hired playmates to shovel
driveways instead of doing the work himself. He paid them $3 of the
$5 he collected. As a boy growing up in India, Vinod Gupta, the
founder of infoUSA Inc., a seller of business information in Omaha
with projected sales this year of $250 million, caught frogs and
sold them to a research laboratory for lunch money. Like other
successful entrepreneurs, these men seemed to have a natural bent
for seizing opportunities. What defines them? Brent Bowers,
co-author with Harold Geneen of the book ``The Synergy Myth'' (St.
Martin's Press, 1996), attempts to answer this question in this
feature.

   Countless small-business owners have forged ahead
optimistically, ignoring the fact that they should have gotten
legal and accounting guidance before entertaining customers.
Lawyers are usually not a happy part of the plan for a new
business. Neither are accountants, investment advisers or other
professionals whose job it is to protect a business from the things
entrepreneurs would rather not think about. Laura Mansnerus, a
staff writer for The New York Times, explains why the suits should
be consulted before the grand opening.

small businesses, reports Times writer Louis Uchitelle in this
cover feature. It's certainly a prime competitive weapon in big
business. Witness Merck &AMP; Company, the giant pharmaceutical
corporation, whose scientists are encouraged to scout outside the
company for promising new research that might lead to a future
drug. Then there are the millions of Americans who believe that the
entrepreneurial spirit resides mainly in small companies with fewer
than 100 employees. Here, self-employment is a big phenomenon,
particularly among workers who have been laid off by corporations.
Uchitelle is a staff writer for The Times.

   John Shoch, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, scans the room
at Bucks, a folksy cafe in Woodside, Calif., and notes that he
recognizes about half the financiers, hardware engineers and
software hackers who are seated. Shoch is doing what he does best:
``surfing,'' or looking for the next big thing in the nation's
technology heartland. What will it be? Is it wireless data? Is the
time finally right for interactive digital television? John
Markoff, a staff writer for The New York Times, reports on the
blinding pace of Silicon Valley and what seems to be everyone's
pastime _ catching the next big wave. Markoff is co-author of the
book ``Takedown: The Pursuit and Capture of America's Most Wanted
Computer Criminal'' (Hyperion, 1996).

   It may not be easy to spell, but entrepreneurialism is all the
rage among potential MBAs. Driven by student and alumni demand, no
field is hotter today in business studies. Whereas a generation ago
the goal of top MBA graduates was to join a Fortune 500 company and
climb the corporate ladder, students' most fervent desire nowadays
seems to be to come up with a marketable idea, start a company and
work for themselves. Ethan Bronner, national educational
correspondent for The New York Times and author of ``Battle for
Justice: How the Bork Nomination Shook America'' (Norton, 1989),
explains why in this feature.

   Donald Katz, the 46-year-old author of three highly acclaimed
nonfiction books, is a rather unlikely entrepreneur. His
three-year-old Internet start-up, Audible Inc., offers custom audio
information delivered on demand over the Web to portable devices
you can listen to any time and anywhere, say, while jogging or

The New York Times, interviews Katz, whose experiences provide

nonbusiness types go into business in a big way. Redburn has

up with the idea: All he did was license the toy from Japan for a
tiny fraction of the amount he made. Now he's a millionaire! There

who has the time _ and money _ to make them happen? Strauss
doesn't, which is why he is giving away his top 10 get-rich-quick

portable baby sitters ... address books, cell phones and wallets

   When Bettina Richards was an artist-and-repertory executive for
big recording companies, she didn't like the way they treated
musicians. Her favorite bands were ignored if they weren't best
sellers; one lead singer, who went on to make a gold album, was
told he shouldn't be singing at all. In 1992, she started her own
company: Thrill Jockey Records. It would release music she cared
about and let the musicians decide what to release, how to package
it and run their careers. A profile by Jon Pareles.

   At age 10, Harold S. Blue, now the chairman of Proxymed Inc., a
health-care information-services company, hired playmates to shovel
driveways instead of doing the work himself. He paid them $3 of the
$5 he collected. As a boy growing up in India, Vinod Gupta, the
founder of infoUSA Inc., a seller of business information in Omaha
with projected sales this year of $250 million, caught frogs and
sold them to a research laboratory for lunch money. Like other
successful entrepreneurs, these men seemed to have a natural bent

   Countless small-business owners have forged ahead
optimistically, ignoring the fact that they should have gotten
legal and accounting guidance before entertaining customers.
Lawyers are usually not a happy part of the plan for a new

professionals whose job it is to protect a business from the things
entrepreneurs would rather not think about. Laura Mansnerus, a
staff writer for The New York Times, explains why the suits should

correspondent for The New York Times and author of ``Battle for

   The entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well in both large and
small businesses, reports Times writer Louis Uchitelle in this
cover feature. It's certainly a prime competitive weapon in big
business. Witness Merck &AMP; Company, the giant pharmaceutical
corporation, whose scientists are encouraged to scout outside the
company for promising new research that might lead to a future
drug. Then there are the millions of Americans who believe that the
entrepreneurial spirit resides mainly in small companies with fewer
than 100 employees. Here, self-employment is a big phenomenon,
particularly among workers who have been laid off by corporations.
Uchitelle is a staff writer for The Times.

 By LOUIS UCHITELLE 
 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   My father was a young and energetic broker employed by a big
textile company, an immigrant's son prospering for the first time,
when his boss summoned him one day and said that because of
corporate setbacks, my father would have to accept a wage cut.
</P>
<P>
   He refused.
</P>
<P>
   Impetuously, he and another young broker resigned, rented an
office on Worth Street, and within a year they were earning more
than they ever had. They not only brokered trades in cotton cloth,
but purchased cloth themselves, gambling on resale at quick
profits.
</P>
<P>
   My father was an entrepreneur or, more precisely, he exhibited
some of the characteristics of an entrepreneur. The concept _ to
break with routine, to innovate, to seize an opportunity, to
develop something new _ is as old as capitalism. But the word
itself and the characteristics it suggests have become popular
among Americans only in the last 15 years as everyone, not just
immigrants and their children, struggles for a place in a rapidly
changing, increasingly competitive economy.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate America is spending billions of dollars on the
restless, entrepreneurial endeavor to develop popular new products
or to rejigger old ones to boost sales.
</P>
<P>
   Only a volatile stock market threatens to curtail this energy by
depriving entrepreneurs, particularly small entrepreneurs, of some
of the financing they need to carry out their ideas. Big companies
have more cash savings to draw on and easier access to credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrepreneurial activity became a concern to the general
public in the 1980s, when we all thought that the United States was
falling behind, and that the rest of the world, particularly Japan,
would sink us,'' said William J. Baumol, an economist and historian
at New York University. ``As soon as people started worrying about
this, they said that Japan was entrepreneurial and America had lost
the spirit of entrepreneurship. And we began self-consciously to
reacquire that spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   My father, getting started in the 1920s, never thought of
himself as an entrepreneur. For him, the entrepreneurial spirit, a
term coming into vogue in his final years, resided exclusively in
energetic small-business owners.
</P>
<P>
   Small business has a role, of course. Starting a business, being
your own boss, risking your savings, operating with high energy _
all these characteristics appear in the evolving definition of the
entrepreneurial spirit, first described in the early 1800s by
Jean-Baptiste Say, a French economist.
</P>
<P>
   But innovation and invention are its essence. And while a Sam
Walton (Wal-Mart) or a Steven Jobs (Apple) or a James Clark and
Marc Andreessen (Netscape) still emerge from the ranks of the
lone-wolf entrepreneurs, innovation and invention occur as often
today in big companies as in small ones. More often, probably.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened is that entrepreneurial innovation has
become the prime competitive weapon, and industry can no longer
wait for the occasional geniuses to come along with something
new,'' Baumol said. ``Companies have had to routinize invention and
innovation. And the big companies have the money to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Merck &AMP; Company, the giant pharmaceutical corporation, certainly
does. Its scientists, who develop drugs at Merck's laboratories,
are encouraged to take on the additional task of scouting outside
the company for promising new research or new technologies that
might lead to the development of a future drug.
</P>
<P>
   When they find this promising outside research they make their
case to a Merck board for money to finance or to buy the outside
research or to form a partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``An entrepreneur to me,'' said Bennett M. Shapiro, the
executive vice president of Merck's worldwide basic research, ``is
someone who picks up something not going on at Merck, but is
important to the future development of a drug, and then makes the
case for why we should fund a relationship, as if he were an
independent entrepreneur appealing to venture capitalists for
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Merck's 5,000 scientists are so entrepreneurial, but
those who are, and succeed in bringing valuable research to Merck,
get handsome payoffs in stock options.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the entrepreneurial flexibility now evident in big
companies, millions of Americans appear to believe that the
entrepreneurial spirit resides mainly in small companies; that is,
owner-operated companies with fewer than 100 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The great attention focused on Silicon Valley start-ups feeds
this view. So do venture capitalists, who buy into the start-ups,
hoping that their innovative products will run up big sales,
quickly raising the value of the venture capitalist's investment.
</P>
<P>
   The Small Business Administration and the National Federation of
Independent Business, a powerful Washington lobbying group
representing small companies, also foster the perspective that
small companies are the chief source of entrepreneurial activity.
For this reason, among several others, small companies should get
government support in the form of special tax breaks and special
exemptions from some regulations. Or so the argument goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the rawest sense of entrepreneurial,'' said William Dennis,
the federation's director of research, ``if I establish a new firm,
I have taken an entrepreneurial act. I have acted in the belief
that I know something others don't, and I am exploiting an
advantage others do not have.''
</P>
<P>
   That is an appealing thought at a time when self-employment is a
big phenomenon, particularly among immigrants and among workers who
have been laid off by corporations. By this definition, a Korean
immigrant, for example, is entrepreneurial if he sets up a flower
kiosk on a street corner, acting on an insight that, in his view, a
competitor on the opposite corner has failed to grasp. He is acting
on the belief that he will draw more customers because his new
kiosk is closer than his competitor's to a bus stop.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists agree that starting a business is
entrepreneurial. But if the Korean immigrant's kiosk survives and
he then presides over a routine daily operation, as most small
business owners do, is he still entrepreneurial?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is no, unless he regains that status by giving his
operation another entrepreneurial kick. David Allen, who founded
Allen Associates in the Boston suburb of Ayer, fits this pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after earning an engineering degree 35 years ago, Allen
began a company to manufacture and sell a wire-and-sponge device
that he had invented and patented to keep corsages moist. The
device sold, and for 20 years, he earned a steady five-figure
income. His entrepreneurial start-up faded into a
nonentrepreneurial, day-to-day operation.
</P>
<P>
   When their two sons became teen-agers in the early '80s, Marie
Allen joined her husband, bringing to the enterprise a background
in, and a yen for, marketing. She soon hit on a way to increase
sales revenues from the 600 wholesale florists who were her
husband's customers.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling to regional trade shows, Allen said: ``We look for
promising new products that people are trying to introduce into the
floral industry, but cannot manage to sell. Marie takes them to
market with our products; we currently are selling 25 different
items to our customers.''

<P>
   Annual revenue for the Allens has nearly quadrupled to $1.1
million from $300,000, when Mrs. Allen came aboard 15 years ago,
and it has reawakened the family business.

<P>
   From Adam Smith's day, the entrepreneurial spirit, in one guise
or another, has been a huge source of change and expansion for the
capitalist market system. The great early-20th century economist,
Joseph A. Schumpeter, gave the concept its modern, expansive twist,
defining an entrepreneur as someone who breaks with routine.
</P>
<P>
   The entrepreneurial function, he wrote, ``does not essentially
consist in either inventing anything or otherwise creating the
conditions which the enterprise exploits. It consists in getting
things done'' right down to ``making a success of a particular kind
of sausage or toothbrush.''

<P>
   WOODSIDE, Calif. _ John Shoch, a Silicon Valley venture
capitalist, scans the room at Bucks, a folksy cafe in this affluent
bedroom community, and notes that he recognizes about half the
financiers, hardware engineers and software hackers who are seated.
</P>
<P>
   Shoch is doing what he does best. He calls it ``surfing'':
looking for the next big thing in the nation's technology
heartland. He is a key player in a remarkably efficient system that
brings together vast pools of capital and good ideas.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs everywhere in Silicon Valley that the region is
no longer an unconnected bunch of competitors located near the
Stanford University campus, which gave birth to the valley's first
company, Hewlett-Packard Company.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, changing jobs in Silicon Valley Inc. is now as simple
as turning into a new driveway on the way to work, or as simple an
idea as the newly created garage.com, which matches entrepreneurs
with venture-capital firms.
</P>
<P>
   A walk down University Avenue in Palo Alto, increasingly the
valley's brain center, will take you past the brand-new offices of
Accel Partners, one of the valley's premier venture-capital firms.
The partners are upstairs; downstairs,
``entrepreneurs-in-residence'' are busy incubating start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   This financing mechanism has created the semiconductor chip, the
digital watch, video games, the personal computer and most recently
the commercial Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Time in the valley seems compressed. This is evident from the
exploding megahertz ratings of microprocessor chips to the
ballooning megabyte storage capacities of memory chips and disk
drives, making everything move faster at an ever-increasing rate.
Around the valley it is best described as living on Internet time.
</P>
<P>
   For Shoch, whose firm, Asset Management, has just completed a
$100 million-plus fund, these are both heady and nervous times.
</P>
<P>
   Surfing, in Shoch's parlance, means catching the next big wave
of technology innovation. And despite the fact that there are more
and more billions of venture-capital dollars flowing into the
valley each year, it is complicated. (The recent stock-market
jitters have left venture capitalists here nervous but still
enthusiastic; in short, holding their breath.)
</P>
<P>
   While the pace of change has become predictable, charting the
direction of change is still an art form.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you'll paddle furiously to catch a wave that fails
to materialize,'' Shoch said. ``While at other times the wave will
appear suddenly and you'll find yourself paddling just as furiously
to try to catch it before it leaves you behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Silicon Valley venture capitalists have made their
reputation by finding and riding a certain wave. For example, in
1989 John Hummer and Ann Winblad established the first
venture-capital firm to focus exclusively on software companies,
just when the software industry was blossoming.
</P>
<P>
   And there are legendary figures, like John Doerr, a partner at
Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield &AMP; Byers. Doerr has had the knack of
making the best investments spanning three eras: personal
computers, workstations and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, everyone was convinced that the next big
thing would be interactive digital television. The vision: Happy
families would sit in their living rooms in front of their TVs and
bank, shop, communicate with other people and be entertained. The
living room has so far not proven to be the right place for
interacting with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Missteps like these have led to absurdities like a Florida
market trial in which a Silicon Valley company tried to hook up TV
sets to computer workstations that had been fine-tuned to pump
movies and digital information into homes. The concept failed
because it cost more than many families want to spend: $25,000
each.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson, of course, is that in Silicon Valley the term
``visionary'' usually describes a job title and not an ability. If
you pressure venture capitalists over a meal at Il Fornaio in Palo
Alto, they will confess that they expect a shakeout and acknowledge
that they are concerned about the huge capital flows coming into
the valley.
</P>
<P>
   One consequence can be seen in the remarkable appreciation of
the value of new deals _ there is just too much money chasing too
few great ideas.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment the risks seem to be outweighed by the
incredible opportunities inspired by the emergence of cyberspace.
While everyone was looking the other way, the Internet sneaked up
on Silicon Valley and sent the venture-capital community racing to
finance start-ups like Netscape Communications, Yahoo, Excite,
Infoseek and Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of the Internet has cranked up the valley's economy to
a feverish pitch. Companies like Apple Computer and Sun
Microsystems have been reinvigorated by the boom in Internet
commerce. There are so many new companies being formed that initial
public offerings are no longer the typical outcome for a start-up.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than five times as many companies created each
year as there are available IPO dollars. Consequently, acquisition
has become an endgame for most start-ups, according to Technologic
Partners, a firm that monitors venture capital in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   That in turn has made the valley even more of a technology
hothouse, attracting a new kind of venture backer _ large
technology companies like AT&AMP;T, Lucent, Intel and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, although Intel executives once referred to the valley's
venture community as ``vulture capitalists'' because they would
entice employees away to start to new chip ventures, the company is
now running the valley's largest venture fund, valued at more than
$300 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the boom-time atmosphere, there are signs that the
Internet wave is cresting and that Silicon Valley is entering one
of those periods between new technologies and new industries.
</P>
<P>
   Today there is no certainty about the next big thing after the
Internet, but everyone is looking. Is it wireless data or is the
time finally right for interactive digital television?
</P>
<P>
   Some believe that the valley is on the brink of an epochal
shift, perhaps from the world of electronic to optical computing.
Such a shift has been predicted for many years by some of the
valley's best thinkers. The world of optical computing is much more
in tune with the communications-rich future that now seems all
around.
</P>
<P>
   The common wisdom here, however, is that any new invention is
subject to the ``15-year'' rule: It usually takes at least 15 years
for a new technology to make it from the laboratory to the market.
</P>
<P>
   In a world where timing is everything _ the right investment at
the wrong moment can be just as disastrous as making the wrong bet
_ a venture capitalist can be left with a lot of sleepless nights,
even in the best of times.

<P>
   EVANSTON, Ill. _ As the sun begins its pink descent behind the
neo-Gothic spire of Deering Library, two barefoot students lazily
toss a Frisbee across a great expanse of lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Four flights up, in Northwestern University's Leverone Hall, 18
students and a professor are gathered around a classroom table.
</P>
<P>
   The talk this July evening is not of Dante or of the
pre-Socratics. It is of angel investors, price-earnings ratios and
what it means to work for a company so young that its founders
still have no desks or no telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   The students, led by Steven Rogers, a clinical professor of
management, are spending their summer working for start-up
companies in the area in what may turn into full-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
   All the students are in the master's of management program of
Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management, one of scores of
business schools that over the last five years have built programs
and majors in entrepreneurship studies, an arresting mix of the
plainly pragmatic and the utterly ephemeral.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by student and alumni demand, no field is hotter today in
business studies than that of entrepreneurship. Whereas a
generation ago the goal of top MBA graduates was to join a Fortune
500 company and climb the corporate ladder, students' most fervent
desire nowadays seems to be to come up with a marketable idea,
start a company and work for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   According to Murray Low, who directs entrepreneurship studies at
Columbia University, scholarship in the field is exploding.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s there were only a few scholarly journals
devoted to new businesses. Today there are 26, most of them started
in the last five years. In 1980, there were 18 entrepreneurship
chairs at business schools. Today there are more than 200.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Katz of St. Louis University, who has been tracking this
growth, says that in a 1991 study of the approximately 300
accredited business schools in the country, a couple dozen were
found to offer some course work in entrepreneurship. Today, about
120 of them offer it as a major.
</P>
<P>
   While defining entrepreneurship studies remains problematic,
scholars in the field agree that its sudden popularity has several
roots. First, the corporate downsizing of the '80s changed the view
that a good corporate job meant long-term security.
</P>
<P>
   Second, technology and globalization have changed the way the
world does business. A product's shelf life has been greatly
reduced, and challenges from remote places mean that companies need
flexibility, which is a challenge for large, formal hierarchies of
traditional corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, scholars say, young people have grown up in an
environment that emphasizes independence and self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrepreneurship is really about the three P's: pride, passion
and perseverance,'' said A. Barry Merkin, a clinical professor of
entrepreneurship at Kellogg. ``It's about risk-taking, boldness and
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The best analogy, Merkin noted, is to sports. ``Intuitive
qualities are essential, but few can reach real heights without
coaching,'' he said. ``There are basic things to learn, like
accounting and finance, but also narrower areas like writing a
business plan, raising capital. I also try to give my students a
feeling of what it is like to go through something like this, the
tensions and frustrations, because folks who go into this without
realizing what they are doing will face nervous breakdowns, heart
attacks and divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   These are not matters, either the business plans or the heart
attacks, most academics with Ph.D.'s want to teach or to study.
There is a lack of reliable data on start-up companies, and without
data it is hard to produce rigorous scholarship, the grist of
academic careers.
</P>
<P>
   This has created a split, because alumni are donating truckloads
of dollars to set up centers and chairs in entrepreneurship, yet
there are no scholars to fill them.
</P>
<P>
   New York University is a good example. Its Stern School of
Business has four endowed chairs of entrepreneurship, two unfilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see entrepreneurship as a word in search of a meaning in the
academic sense,'' said George Daly, Stern's dean. ``Academics sort
themselves into these little silos, and entrepreneurship is not
easily matched for them. But the role being played by small,
innovative enterprises in our society is phenomenal and should be
studied. The challenge is to persuade academics to look beyond
their own boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Business schools are increasingly turning to practitioners
rather than scholars to teach entrepreneurship, either alone or
paired with a more traditional professor. That is why Merkin of
Kellogg is called a ``clinical professor,'' on the model of medical
school professors who are M.D.s rather than Ph.D.'s. This, too, has
caused tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally speaking, tenured professors consider businessmen
without Ph.D's to be lower-life forms,'' said Kenneth P. Morse, the
founder of high-tech ventures and managing director of the
Entrepreneurship Center at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology Sloan School of Management. ``But there were 1 million
start-ups in the world last year, and anyone who wants to be
involved in such a start-up has a lot to learn _ how to pick the
funding, how to give a raise, how not to run out of money. This is
different from what used to be taught.''
</P>
<P>
   Young scholars are beginning to take the plunge. One is Paul A.
Gompers, an associate professor of business administration at
Harvard Business School. Gompers acknowledges the difficulty in
gathering data but says the field is too exciting to allow that to
be a barrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get data from private consulting firms or through large
pension funds or endowments that provide access to their files,''
Gompers said. ``A lot of it is hand-collected. I'm putting together
data on 1,300 firms, collecting a complete financial history, their
boards of directors, scales of compensation to study how they
operate and grow. I have hired 10 to 15 research assistants during
the course of this project over the last two and a half years.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, much of what goes on at entrepreneurship centers
today consists of students going through the motions of setting up
new ventures, and sometimes actually doing the ventures. Business
school has turned into a kind of laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Business-plan competitions, both local and national, have grown
rapidly in scale with students presenting their plans to venture
capitalists and competing for donated prize money to help them set
up companies.
</P>
<P>
   One such winner was Evan Schumacher, a 29-year-old native of
Boston who finished at Northwestern this spring. His plan called
for setting up a software company that tracks global shipping,
freight and customs management for international firms.
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher won the Kellogg competition and took his plan to
Austin, Tex., in May for national finals. He was a finalist, and as
he walked off the stage after his presentation, his wireless
microphone still clipped to his lapel, a man in the audience
approached him and asked how much he needed.
</P>
<P>
   The man became the company's first angel investor, in for
$250,000. The company, Celarix, was born at the end of June in
Chicago. So far, it has raised $500,000 from investors and is
planning to raise another $1 million to $2 million from venture
capitalist firms. A third employee will join the company this
month.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   WAYNE, N.J. _ Drive west from Manhattan, through the Lincoln
Tunnel and into the thick of one of the many commercial
bloodstreams that feeds the suburban beast engulfing New York City.
Go about 20 miles from the Hudson River to a nondescript office
building that overlooks a 14-theater multiplex and a warehouse-size
Costco. That is where you'll find, on the third floor, a modest
little company called Audible Inc., which just happens to have
outsize ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   It's an unlikely location, certainly, for a three-year-old
Internet start-up, one that hopes to create a big audience for
something completely different: custom audio information delivered
on demand over the Web to portable devices you can listen to any
time and anywhere, say, while jogging or driving to work.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the guy who founded the company, Donald Katz, who is
46 and the author of three highly acclaimed nonfiction books, is a
rather unlikely entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Katz never marched to anyone's beat but his own. In starting
Audible, he drew on his own experiences as a writer combined with
the thirst to create something new from the seemingly limitless
potential of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Audible seeks to wed the oldest of human technologies, the
spoken word, with the newest of technologies,'' he said with
characteristic ardor. ``We want to be a leader in teaching the
Internet to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Translating that vision into a successful business will not be
easy. Audible is losing plenty of money.
</P>
<P>
   The company has about 35 employees, its own portable player and
a Web site (www.audible.com) where users can immediately download
from a selection of 16,000 hours of copyrighted audio files
containing everything from traditional read-aloud books like Frank
McCourt's ``Angela's Ashes'' ($9) to bundles of advice ($3 to $13)
from the Harvard Business Review and such. For all its success in
building a new infrastructure, however, the company is just
beginning to attract paying customers.
</P>
<P>
   Katz is accustomed to taking risks. For two decades, from the
time he left graduate school at the London School of Economics in
1975, Katz was a free-lance journalist.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '80s, Katz turned his attention to money and
business. Originally from Chicago, he decided to write a book about
Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Company, his hometown giant.
</P>
<P>
   Sears, the once-great store of the American middle class and one
of the most secretive corporations in the country, was in the midst
of an immense crisis. Katz persuaded Edward Telling, its chief
executive, to give him carte blanche access to the company. The
book, ``The Big Store,'' took six years to research and write.
</P>
<P>
   Katz followed with two other books that also required him to
open closed doors, one a look at the post-World War middle-class
experience told through a single extended family that revealed its
most intimate secrets, and the other an inside look at Nike and its
reclusive chairman, Phil Knight.
</P>
<P>
   In business, surprisingly, Katz did find a subject worthy of
epic treatment. And he discovered he had a taste for it.
</P>
<P>
   With Ed Lau, his college roommate who moved into the computer
industry, Katz began to develop an idea for a business that would
deliver radio programs and audio books through the Internet. His
next book project, on the convergence of digital technologies, was
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something I couldn't write into reality,'' Katz said.
``I had to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He found a fresh outlet for the powers of persuasion that had
opened so many doors in his writing career. The first big convert
was Tim Mott, now a wealthy private investor in Ketchum, Idaho, who
is renowned in Silicon Valley as a co-founder of Electronic Arts,
the computer-game maker, and Macromedia, a software company
specializing in multimedia graphic-design applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get calls all the time about start-up ideas, and I probably
look at least one business plan a week,'' Mott said. ``Over the
course of five years, I've seen, maybe, four that I wanted to
commit money and time. This was one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   With Mott as chairman, they made the round of venture-capital
firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim's business experience and Don's visionary ideas were a
powerful combination,'' said Kevin Compton, a partner at Kleiner
Perkins who became their chief backer there. ``Three minutes into
conversation you could just feel his passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Audible is built around the premise that lots of people are
willing to pay regularly to fill their time _ on the go _ with
constantly changing packages of verbal packages of entertainment,
news and practical advice.
</P>
<P>
   Even more promising is the potential for pumping millions of
mobile workers full of management information, corporate training
and ``time-shifted'' business news while traveling.
</P>
<P>
   To make all that possible, Audible had to design its own
portable player. It is roughly the size and shape of an electric
razor, holds two hours of audio and plugs into a personal computer
through a cradle similar to one used in hand-held computers. People
can carry the battery-powered gadget anywhere, listen to it through
headphones or play clips in a car stereo system.
</P>
<P>
   Programs are stored on a computer, ready to refill the player as
soon as it is returned to its cradle, which remains attached to the
computer.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, though, the player is also an Achilles heel. It
is relatively expensive, costing $200 as a stand-alone purchase.
Two hours is not enough storage time, particularly since lots of
audio books run three to four hours. And it is not easy for the
technologically challenged to try.
</P>
<P>
   To overcome these drawbacks, Audible is developing a
second-generation player with greater abilities and is exploring
new pricing plans similar to those used to sell mobile-phone
services, in which buyers would receive the player at a steep
reduction if they sign up for a subscription.
</P>
<P>
   Relying mostly on word of mouth, Audible says it has attracted
more than 5,000 customers and shipped about 3,000 players. Those
using the player spend an average of about $20 a month on fresh
content.
</P>
<P>
   But Audible's real ace in the hole is not the player but the
rights it has painstakingly sewn up with dozens of content
providers. It is introducing new programs _ from an audio digest of
The Wall Street Journal to National Public Radio's ``Fresh Air''
program _ that will be sent automatically to a subscriber's
computer.
</P>
<P>
   And it will adapt all Audible's products so they can be played
on a variety of portable devices, beginning with the hand-held
organizers powered by Microsoft's Windows CE software.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the recent stock-market turmoil, Audible's outside
investors, who own about 56 percent of the company (the founders
and employees own the rest) remained cautious about going public,
insisting they do not intend to sell stock until the company is
generating a growing and predictable revenue stream.

   Whenever I look at my bank statement, I think of Ken Hakuta, aka
Dr. Fad. Best known as the inventor of the Wacky Wall Walker, he
made some $20 million from slime-covered plastic creatures that
ooze down vertical surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of it is that Hakuta didn't even come up with the
idea: All he did was license the toy from Japan for a tiny fraction
of the amount he made. Now he's a millionaire and is a prominent
figure on the lecture and convention circuits.
</P>
<P>
   With one simple idea he achieved the American dream _ money and
fame.
</P>
<P>
   There are countless Hakutas _ inventors of the pet rock, sliced
bread, the rolling lint remover, the better mousetrap. And I want
to be one. But I'm too busy writing articles like this one to
follow up on any get-rich-quick schemes, and I can't seem to put
the energy into starting a corporation dedicated to carrying out my
ideas. So I have decided to give them away.
</P>
<P>
   1. Some clever wag has beaten me to the idea of portable gyms:
trainers who park outside your home in vans full of exercise
equipment. But no one has come up with portable baby sitters. Tired
of having to constantly call home during a dinner date to check on
your child or to leave a movie early to deal with a small
emergency? With a portable baby sitter, your child can follow you
around on your date or outing in an RV with toys, a bed and a
licensed sitter. Now you can look in on your little one during
theater intermissions and deal with a crisis without abandoning
your plans.
</P>
<P>
   2. Copyright millennium slogans or register Web site domain
names that corporations will eventually want to buy from you. Some
examples of slogans include ``A new car for a new millennium'' or
``Relief for the morning after the millennium.'' For Web sites, you
could try to cut yourself in on a piece of Mr. Hakuta's millions
and register a wackywallwalker.com.
</P>
<P>
   3. The inventions of tow ropes and chairlifts revolutionized
skiing, enabling entrepreneurs to open ridiculously overpriced ski
resorts. So where are the surf resorts? Tow ropes, jet skis and
above-water conveyer belts could drop surfers off at their favorite
wave and save them from exhausting, time-consuming paddling. Of
course, some surfers will complain that paddling to the wave is
integral to the sport, but soon surfing anywhere besides a resort
will seem as antiquated as hiking uphill to ski.
</P>
<P>
   4. The best entrepreneurs come up with products nobody has heard
of and then persuade the public that it can't live without them.
Here is my candidate: by developing a system to measure the sense
of smell (akin to the eye-chart test), an entrepreneur can make a
fortune by inventing smelling aids for people with deficient
olfactory nerves.
</P>
<P>
   5. Create a line of address books, cell phones, wallets and
purses that, like cordless telephones, beep when they're lost. Even
better, for obsessive message-checkers not satisfied with pagers,
devise a key chain or a small toy that lights up whenever their
answering machine takes a call. In addition, a huge market has
opened up in Japan for cellular phone accessories that could be
exploited in America: different styles of straps and antennae,
trinkets to make phones ring differently and lights that flash when
the phone rings.
</P>
<P>
   6. Become an apartment broker in a competitive city like New
York or San Francisco. But instead of representing realtors or
buildings, start a trustworthy company that represents renters.
They can tell you exactly what they want, then you find it and pay
a deposit to reserve the apartment until they can see it. To corner
the market, you could pay apartment owners a fee to give you a copy
of their listing on the same day they send it to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   7. There are sperm banks, but no public egg banks. These would
be for working women who don't want to have children until they
retire. This way, women can finally stop the ticking of that
biological clock by depositing an egg when they're in their 20s or
30s. The egg will then be preserved until a woman is ready to rear
a child.
</P>
<P>
   8. The best ice cream in the world is Bertillon, a French
delicacy with flavors so precise that anyone marketing it in
America could revolutionize the ice-cream business the way Jelly
Bellys cornered the jelly bean market. This is not a joke, but a
way to a better society.
</P>
<P>
   9. One reason people drive when they're drunk is because they
don't want to have to take a cab home and then wake up in the
morning without their car. By creating an 800-IM-DRUNK line in
car-oriented cities like Los Angeles and Dallas, this problem could
be solved. The service would actually drive a chauffeur to a
restaurant, club or house to take the inebriated client home (or
even to another bar or party) in his or her own car.
</P>
<P>
   10. I was recently notified that someone had taken my idea of
making custom fortune cookies for parties. But kids' dolls could be
personalized in a similar way by having a talking toy like Tickle
Me Elmo or Teletubby and replacing its voice chip with a homemade
one. It could either have personalized messages (``Get to work,
George'') or just undoll-like comments. (``Gee whiz, cover up your
bellybutton, it looks obscene.'')
</P>
<P>
   Space prohibits me from elaborating on more ideas. But with
hundreds of thousands of people reading this, it seems very likely
that within the next 24 hours these baker's-dozen recommendations
will soon be patented and put into development.

 &HT;    
 By JON PARELES 
 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   When Bettina Richards was an artist-and-repertory executive for
big recording companies, she didn't like the way they treated
musicians. Her favorite bands were ignored if they weren't best
sellers; one lead singer, who went on to make a gold album, was
told he shouldn't be singing at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't happy,'' Richards said. ``I was making money, but I
couldn't talk to anyone about the great show I saw last night or
the great record I found. It was a job.''
</P>
<P>
   So in 1992, she started her own company: Thrill Jockey Records,
named after a gang of delinquents in a B movie. It would release
music she cared about and let the musicians decide what to release,
how to package it and run their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted a company where the artists' expectations and the
labels' abilities were in line,'' she said. ``I don't think major
labels are inherently evil or out to destroy the world. I just
don't happen to use music that fits their system.''
</P>
<P>
   That music, Richards said, is simply ``what I like.'' Thrill
Jockey is a leading outlet for what some critics have named
``post-rock'': instrumentals that elude categorization as jazz, pop
tunes or dance music. The label's best-selling band is Tortoise,
whose most recent album has sold nearly 100,000 worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   But Thrill Jockey has also released albums by the
neo-Appalachian duo Freakwater, two women who sing about hard
times; the electronic group Oval, which has built compositions on
the sounds of skipping CDs; and the Nerve, a peppy alternative-rock
band.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of freaky, left-of-center stuff that she puts out,
but at the same time there's a big enough audience so that she can
make a living,'' said Nic Harcourt, the creative music director of
KCRW-FM in Santa Monica, Calif., and the host of the station's
``Morning Becomes Eclectic,'' a program that the music business on
the West Coast follows closely.
</P>
<P>
   In six years, Thrill Jockey has released 60 albums (both as CDs
and old-fashioned vinyl LPs), singles and EPs. All but three
releases have broken even or turned a profit. By contrast, 80
percent to 90 percent of albums from major labels post losses.
</P>
<P>
   But Thrill Jockey works on a grass-roots scale, seeking sales in
thousands rather than millions; its typical release breaks even
with sales of 1,500 CDs and 500 LPs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Thrill Jockey's profit was $183,000, and while that
is probably less than what Columbia Records spends on catering, it
is a success story in independent rock.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, Richards, who is 33 years old, did everything
herself, from signing talent to lining up band interviews. Now
Thrill Jockey has three other full-time employees and one part
timer and is about to buy its own small building.
</P>
<P>
   Richards started Thrill Jockey while working four days a week at
Pier Platters, an alternative-rock record store in Hoboken, N.J.
She ran the label from her third-floor walk-up apartment on Avenue
C in Manhattan, carrying mail-order CDs to UPS because she didn't
ship enough to qualify for a pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Her capital was $20,000 from her grandmother, $10,000 from her
father and the $5,000 from her savings account; she has never
needed another infusion. Her business advisers were people who had
started their own labels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was constantly asking advice from people: cheaper places to
press things, ways to cut corners,'' she said. ``One thing about
independently distributed record labels is that you don't get this
competitive feeling. As long as you are willing to reciprocate with
information, people are happy to give it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Richards moved from New York to Chicago, where her main
manufacturer and distributor, Touch and Go, is based. Rent and
taxes are considerably lower than they are in New York, she noted.
</P>
<P>
   Many independent companies are stepping stones for bands that
hope to be discovered by major labels. By contract, the smaller
labels then share in the profits from the major-label releases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to spend my time as a farm label,'' Richards
said. ``From a business standpoint, it would be better to have
bands bound to contracts so I'd get a piece of their future. But I
don't want to make money from a system I don't support.''
</P>
<P>
   Thrill Jockey makes unusually generous deals with musicians.
Once an album breaks even, the label and the musicians each get 50
percent of the gross receipts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the net comes down, they actually get more than me,''
Richards said. Contracts are often literally a handshake.
</P>
<P>
   Richards chooses bands that, she thinks, can benefit from the
scale of her company and will stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``If becoming famous is their primary focus, then we're not the
right label for them,'' she said. ``But if they want to continue to
make music and live off that, then that's a goal we can achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Thrill Jockey records most albums for under $3,000, one
three-hundredth of what a band like U2 spends, and advertises
sparingly. Video clips tend to be made by friends of the bands or
as projects by art students, though they have been shown
occasionally on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Thrill Jockey depends largely on the unpaid promotion of college
radio stations and reviews in the press, but it also uses club disk
jockeys and skateboarding magazines to reach consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each record is totally different,'' Richards said. ``It's not
as if I sold a really great new garbage can or a nice clock. Your
most popular band this year could be completely unpopular next
year. My company has to be flexible and adapt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my company to stay in business and do well,'' Richards
said. ``But the creative stuff was always the motivation that
sparked it. It wasn't, I see a way to make money better. It was, I
can make this artist's experience better.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lot of work,'' Richards added. ``But it never feels
like a job.''

   Even as children, many of them spotted a business angle nobody
else did, and milked it for all it was worth.
</P>
<P>
   At age 10, Harold S. Blue, now the chairman of Proxymed Inc., a
health-care information-services company in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
figured he could make more money if he hired playmates to shovel
driveways instead of doing the work himself. He paid them $3 of the
$5 he collected and even had the presence of mind to ply his trade
outside his neighborhood so that the mothers wouldn't catch on to
his scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was out of high school, Blue owned and operated two
drug stores.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy growing up in a village in India 100 miles north of New
Delhi, Vinod Gupta, the founder of infoUSA Inc., a seller of
business information in Omaha with projected sales this year of
$250 million, caught frogs at a swamp and sold them to a research
laboratory for lunch money.
</P>
<P>
   In college, he rented entire passenger-train cars to make a
36-hour trip to New Delhi, and then sold seat tickets individually
for a quick 25 percent profit.
</P>
<P>
   Not every successful business owner can boast of such an early
flair for salesmanship. But even those who drifted or were pushed
into entrepreneurial careers seem to have a natural bent for
seizing opportunities that make competitors wonder why on earth
they didn't think of that themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Is that what defines them? They are an eclectic lot who operate
ventures that vary from grocery stores to Internet start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Donald J. Jonovic, a consultant in Cleveland who has advised
hundreds of family businesses, says he never fails to be astonished
by the ``raw diversity'' of American entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at some of them and you ask, `My God, how'd that
happen?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a country that prides itself on individualism and counts
literally millions of entrepreneurs, it is a question worth asking.
Small businesses, roughly defined as ventures controlled by their
founders and taking in less than $250 million in revenue a year,
are an enormous force in the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   But what drives their owners to strike out on their own rather
than take refuge in the predictability and perks of salaried jobs?
</P>
<P>
   The experts, of course, have their views. Jonovic says true
entrepreneurs are marked by a combination of ``tunnel-vision
dedication'' and supreme self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   David G. Winter, a professor of psychology at the University of
Michigan, said they are propelled by a zeal to excel at whatever
they do, a trait he calls ``achievement motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have this optimism, this exuberance, this boldness,''
Winter said, which can take the form of restlessness, especially if
their business grows into a larger, bureaucratic organization they
can't control. If that happens, he said, ``they may be so unable to
deal with it that they get dismissed by their board. Or they may
quit and start all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said entrepreneurs often display a streak of
authoritarianism because they believe their method is the only way
to do things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing their best is what matters most to them, as opposed to a
concern with friendship or power,'' Winter said.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs, he added, tend to come from middle-class
backgrounds, not blue-collar homes or wealthy families, ``which
still view small business as a step downward into vulgar trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonovic said that many entrepreneurs are tightfisted, not out of
greed but because each dollar they earn represents a small fraction
of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew a successful entrepreneur who ended up in a nursing
home and wouldn't pay for a private room because he wanted to keep
his estate above $1 million,'' Jonovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs themselves cite a long list of self-defining
characteristics and attributes: decisiveness, resilience, focus, a
love of battle, a penchant for risk-taking, workaholism, good
social skills.
</P>
<P>
   But as they recount their histories, two core themes leap out,
flip sides of the same coin: They want to be their own boss, and
they show an uncanny knack for detecting opportunities that others
missed.
</P>
<P>
   For most entrepreneurs, it all begins with the realization that
working for somebody else just isn't a choice.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to go it alone can be liberating, but it can also
be scary because it means cutting off the corporate safety net.
</P>
<P>
   Eric B. Segal, the president of the Kenzer Corp., an
executive-recruiting firm in New York, recalls the near-panic he
and his partner, Robert D. Kenzer, felt in the early days of
running their company in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Segal had been a corporate executive in the retail industry, but
quit a high-paying job after he got what he viewed as an
insufficient raise. As he and Kenzer scrambled to find clients, he
said, he kept thinking: Where's the check? Where's Mommy?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are rules you learn from working in big business, but
nobody's prepared for flying without the net until you do it,''
said Segal, who is 55. ``It's frightening. I see a lot of corporate
guys who can't make the conversion.''
</P>
<P>
   But many entrepreneurs insist that the absence of security is a
small price to pay for the freedom to operate at their own pace and
on their own scale.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Yellin, a small-business consultant who works out of her
Manhattan apartment, says she is determined to remain a one-person
show earning just enough money to live comfortably and ``feed my
cat Fancy Feasts.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Yellin is quick to see business possibilities in
humdrum circumstances. A telemarketing specialist who has made an
instructional tape titled ``Warming Up to Cold Calling,'' Yellin,
46, has even figured out how to turn phone pitches she receives at
home to her financial advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of the callers are terrible at selling,'' she said.
``That gives me an opportunity to call their bosses and say, `You
should book me for some training.'''

<P>
   Deborah L. Jacobs, lawyer-turned-writer, gave a heartfelt
compliment to the young man who arrived with his helper to clean
her house in Brooklyn recently: the name of his service was awfully
clever. But she wasn't going to leave it at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you trademarked it?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   He had not, he told Jacobs, who happened to be the author of
``Legal Smarts for Small Business.'' And that answer worried her,
enough that she will not disclose the name of the young
entrepreneur's business until he has finished scurrying around to
obtain trademark protection.
</P>
<P>
   After all, a name that isn't trademarked can be used by someone
else unless the first person brings out expensive legal artillery
to stop the competition.
</P>
<P>
   It was just one example, Jacobs said, of how small-business
owners forge ahead optimistically, figuring that nothing can go
wrong, when they should part with a few hundred dollars, or a few
thousand depending on the legal task, for a lawyer who, by training
and temperament, can anticipate everything going wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``How far can an entrepreneur get without a lawyer?'' she said.
``Pretty far. But it can cost you a lot, a whole lot, later.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers are usually not a happy part of the plan for a new
business. Neither are accountants, investment advisers or other
professionals whose job it is to protect a business from the things
entrepreneurs would rather not think about.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the typical entrepreneurial attitude,'' said Fred S.
Steingold, a lawyer in Ann Arbor, Mich., and the author of ``The
Legal Guide for Starting and Running a Small Business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to get along with their business, and they're not
detail-oriented,'' he said. ``They're impatient. That's what makes
them good entrepreneurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Some tiny service businesses, of course, start and run fine
without professional advice; a dog walker or a window washer can
obtain a business license (and probably should in many cities, for
tax reasons), file a Schedule C and never pay for a consultation.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a retail or a professional business, Jacobs said, ``as a
sole proprietor you can absolutely hang out your shingle without
consulting a lawyer, although if you're operating out of your house
you might want to check the zoning rules.''
</P>
<P>
   But any other form of ownership _ partnership and any type of
corporation _ requires legal and probably accounting guidance.
</P>
<P>
   On the complexity scale, the simplest is a partnership, which
most experts say should begin with a written agreement spelling
out, for example, what happens if one owner dies or quits the
business. This is well-charted territory, especially since the
Uniform Partnership Act governs in almost all states, and by
following legal guides for the general public and form books that
contain standard agreements, most people can do the paperwork and
whatever modifications they want.
</P>
<P>
   But even Steingold, whose publisher, Nolo Press, produces
self-help books and software, suggests that a lawyer review an
agreement. He gives the same advice for forming a simple
corporation _ with the preliminary note that owners might want to
first ask a lawyer whether they need to incorporate.
</P>
<P>
   (The main advantage, ordinarily, is protection of the individual
owners from legal liabilities. There are tax advantages and
disadvantages, too, best sorted out by an accountant.)
</P>
<P>
   The paperwork _ state filing papers, articles of incorporation
and shareholder provisions _ is manageable for most people; Nolo
Press, among others, publishes general guides and versions specific
to several states, including New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   Having a lawyer review the documents is fairly painless: in
Steingold's case, about an hour of his time, or $175. For handling
the whole process, his flat fee in most cases is $600. (In big
cities, where costs are generally higher, charges can run as high
as $2,000.)
</P>
<P>
   As for buying a business, whatever you plan to do, Steingold
said, self-education and self-representation won't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need advice on whether to buy the assets or just the
corporate shell,'' he said. ``The typical purchase agreement is
pretty complicated. There are all kinds of decisions about how it's
going to be financed. Then there are 10 to 20 documents that show
up at a closing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people, he said, will come into a lawyer's office with a
proposed sales contract that originated with the seller or came
from a form book, ``but it would be difficult for somebody who
doesn't have any legal experience to go through a closing.''
</P>
<P>
   Do-it-yourself accounting is not recommended either, but
entrepreneurs can keep bills down by doing the prep work. Software
programs offer simplified bookkeeping tasks and enable people to
monitor cash-flow statements and projections.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone starting a business should be thoroughly immersed in
those numbers anyway, said Ginny Beauchamp, the vice president of
the National Association for the Self-Employed in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Beauchamp added, however small the business, ``having an
accountant do audits a couple times a year is a very good idea, and
if your business is growing by leaps and bounds, obviously you need
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the simplest sole proprietorships can do without
accountants for tax planning and preparation. Businesses can get in
trouble for failing to keep up with changes in tax law, as many did
several years ago when they failed to amend their Keough plans.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a quarter of small-business owners were delinquent in
filing new plans with the Internal Revenue Service, many because
they were unaware of the new requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs said small-business owners, whether through
cost-consciousness or hopeful ignorance, make two mistakes in
circumventing lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   First, she said, they wave off legal advice until they are in
trouble. She mentioned the entrepreneur who spent hundreds of
thousands of dollars making a CD-ROM called ``The First Electronic
Jewish Bookshelf.'' His product brought a warning letter from
Microsoft, which was using the term ``bookshelf.'' At that point,
the entrepreneur had to get a lawyer and enter extremely expensive
settlement negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Second, she said, ``many attempt to play amateur lawyer.''
Jacobs recommends self-help books to pare legal costs and identify
business concerns. Nolo's, she advised, ``are very well researched
and well written and provide great background.'' Even after
practicing law for six years, she does not hesitate to hire others.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I need a specialized kind of legal help, I hire the best
expert I can,'' she said. ``I would no sooner be an amateur in the
legal field than I would be an amateur electrician and rewire my
house.''

 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   My father was a young and energetic broker employed by a big
textile company, an immigrant's son prospering for the first time,
when his boss summoned him one day and said that because of
corporate setbacks, my father would have to accept a wage cut.
</P>
<P>
   He refused.
</P>
<P>
   Impetuously, he and another young broker resigned, rented an
office on Worth Street, and within a year they were earning more
than they ever had. They not only brokered trades in cotton cloth,
but purchased cloth themselves, gambling on resale at quick
profits.
</P>
<P>
   My father was an entrepreneur or, more precisely, he exhibited
some of the characteristics of an entrepreneur. The concept _ to
break with routine, to innovate, to seize an opportunity, to
develop something new _ is as old as capitalism. But the word
itself and the characteristics it suggests have become popular
among Americans only in the last 15 years as everyone, not just
immigrants and their children, struggles for a place in a rapidly
changing, increasingly competitive economy.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate America is spending billions of dollars on the
restless, entrepreneurial endeavor to develop popular new products
or to rejigger old ones to boost sales.
</P>
<P>
   Only a volatile stock market threatens to curtail this energy by
depriving entrepreneurs, particularly small entrepreneurs, of some
of the financing they need to carry out their ideas. Big companies
have more cash savings to draw on and easier access to credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrepreneurial activity became a concern to the general
public in the 1980s, when we all thought that the United States was
falling behind, and that the rest of the world, particularly Japan,
would sink us,'' said William J. Baumol, an economist and historian
at New York University. ``As soon as people started worrying about
this, they said that Japan was entrepreneurial and America had lost
the spirit of entrepreneurship. And we began self-consciously to
reacquire that spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   My father, getting started in the 1920s, never thought of
himself as an entrepreneur. For him, the entrepreneurial spirit, a
term coming into vogue in his final years, resided exclusively in
energetic small-business owners.
</P>
<P>
   Small business has a role, of course. Starting a business, being
your own boss, risking your savings, operating with high energy _
all these characteristics appear in the evolving definition of the
entrepreneurial spirit, first described in the early 1800s by
Jean-Baptiste Say, a French economist.
</P>
<P>
   But innovation and invention are its essence. And while a Sam
Walton (Wal-Mart) or a Steven Jobs (Apple) or a James Clark and
Marc Andreessen (Netscape) still emerge from the ranks of the
lone-wolf entrepreneurs, innovation and invention occur as often
today in big companies as in small ones. More often, probably.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened is that entrepreneurial innovation has
become the prime competitive weapon, and industry can no longer
wait for the occasional geniuses to come along with something
new,'' Baumol said. ``Companies have had to routinize invention and
innovation. And the big companies have the money to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Merck &AMP; Company, the giant pharmaceutical corporation, certainly
does. Its scientists, who develop drugs at Merck's laboratories,
are encouraged to take on the additional task of scouting outside
the company for promising new research or new technologies that
might lead to the development of a future drug.
</P>
<P>
   When they find this promising outside research they make their
case to a Merck board for money to finance or to buy the outside
research or to form a partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``An entrepreneur to me,'' said Bennett M. Shapiro, the
executive vice president of Merck's worldwide basic research, ``is
someone who picks up something not going on at Merck, but is
important to the future development of a drug, and then makes the
case for why we should fund a relationship, as if he were an
independent entrepreneur appealing to venture capitalists for
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Merck's 5,000 scientists are so entrepreneurial, but
those who are, and succeed in bringing valuable research to Merck,
get handsome payoffs in stock options.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the entrepreneurial flexibility now evident in big
companies, millions of Americans appear to believe that the
entrepreneurial spirit resides mainly in small companies; that is,
owner-operated companies with fewer than 100 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The great attention focused on Silicon Valley start-ups feeds
this view. So do venture capitalists, who buy into the start-ups,
hoping that their innovative products will run up big sales,
quickly raising the value of the venture capitalist's investment.
</P>
<P>
   The Small Business Administration and the National Federation of
Independent Business, a powerful Washington lobbying group
representing small companies, also foster the perspective that
small companies are the chief source of entrepreneurial activity.
For this reason, among several others, small companies should get
government support in the form of special tax breaks and special
exemptions from some regulations. Or so the argument goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the rawest sense of entrepreneurial,'' said William Dennis,
the federation's director of research, ``if I establish a new firm,
I have taken an entrepreneurial act. I have acted in the belief
that I know something others don't, and I am exploiting an
advantage others do not have.''
</P>
<P>
   That is an appealing thought at a time when self-employment is a
big phenomenon, particularly among immigrants and among workers who
have been laid off by corporations. By this definition, a Korean
immigrant, for example, is entrepreneurial if he sets up a flower
kiosk on a street corner, acting on an insight that, in his view, a
competitor on the opposite corner has failed to grasp. He is acting
on the belief that he will draw more customers because his new
kiosk is closer than his competitor's to a bus stop.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists agree that starting a business is
entrepreneurial. But if the Korean immigrant's kiosk survives and
he then presides over a routine daily operation, as most small
business owners do, is he still entrepreneurial?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is no, unless he regains that status by giving his
operation another entrepreneurial kick. David Allen, who founded
Allen Associates in the Boston suburb of Ayer, fits this pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after earning an engineering degree 35 years ago, Allen
began a company to manufacture and sell a wire-and-sponge device
that he had invented and patented to keep corsages moist. The
device sold, and for 20 years, he earned a steady five-figure
income. His entrepreneurial start-up faded into a
nonentrepreneurial, day-to-day operation.
</P>
<P>
   When their two sons became teen-agers in the early '80s, Marie
Allen joined her husband, bringing to the enterprise a background
in, and a yen for, marketing. She soon hit on a way to increase
sales revenues from the 600 wholesale florists who were her
husband's customers.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling to regional trade shows, Allen said: ``We look for
promising new products that people are trying to introduce into the
floral industry, but cannot manage to sell. Marie takes them to
market with our products; we currently are selling 25 different
items to our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Annual revenue for the Allens has nearly quadrupled to $1.1
million from $300,000, when Mrs. Allen came aboard 15 years ago,
and it has reawakened the family business.
</P>
<P>
   From Adam Smith's day, the entrepreneurial spirit, in one guise
or another, has been a huge source of change and expansion for the
capitalist market system. The great early-20th century economist,
Joseph A. Schumpeter, gave the concept its modern, expansive twist,
defining an entrepreneur as someone who breaks with routine.
</P>
<P>
   The entrepreneurial function, he wrote, ``does not essentially
consist in either inventing anything or otherwise creating the
conditions which the enterprise exploits. It consists in getting
things done'' right down to ``making a success of a particular kind
of sausage or toothbrush.''

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   WOODSIDE, Calif. _ John Shoch, a Silicon Valley venture
capitalist, scans the room at Bucks, a folksy cafe in this affluent
bedroom community, and notes that he recognizes about half the
financiers, hardware engineers and software hackers who are seated.
</P>
<P>
   Shoch is doing what he does best. He calls it ``surfing'':
looking for the next big thing in the nation's technology
heartland. He is a key player in a remarkably efficient system that
brings together vast pools of capital and good ideas.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs everywhere in Silicon Valley that the region is
no longer an unconnected bunch of competitors located near the
Stanford University campus, which gave birth to the valley's first
company, Hewlett-Packard Company.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, changing jobs in Silicon Valley Inc. is now as simple
as turning into a new driveway on the way to work, or as simple an
idea as the newly created garage.com, which matches entrepreneurs
with venture-capital firms.
</P>
<P>
   A walk down University Avenue in Palo Alto, increasingly the
valley's brain center, will take you past the brand-new offices of
Accel Partners, one of the valley's premier venture-capital firms.
The partners are upstairs; downstairs,
``entrepreneurs-in-residence'' are busy incubating start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   This financing mechanism has created the semiconductor chip, the
digital watch, video games, the personal computer and most recently
the commercial Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Time in the valley seems compressed. This is evident from the
exploding megahertz ratings of microprocessor chips to the
ballooning megabyte storage capacities of memory chips and disk
drives, making everything move faster at an ever-increasing rate.
Around the valley it is best described as living on Internet time.
</P>
<P>
   For Shoch, whose firm, Asset Management, has just completed a
$100 million-plus fund, these are both heady and nervous times.
</P>
<P>
   Surfing, in Shoch's parlance, means catching the next big wave
of technology innovation. And despite the fact that there are more
and more billions of venture-capital dollars flowing into the
valley each year, it is complicated. (The recent stock-market
jitters have left venture capitalists here nervous but still
enthusiastic; in short, holding their breath.)
</P>
<P>
   While the pace of change has become predictable, charting the
direction of change is still an art form.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you'll paddle furiously to catch a wave that fails
to materialize,'' Shoch said. ``While at other times the wave will
appear suddenly and you'll find yourself paddling just as furiously
to try to catch it before it leaves you behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Silicon Valley venture capitalists have made their
reputation by finding and riding a certain wave. For example, in
1989 John Hummer and Ann Winblad established the first
venture-capital firm to focus exclusively on software companies,
just when the software industry was blossoming.
</P>
<P>
   And there are legendary figures, like John Doerr, a partner at
Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield &AMP; Byers. Doerr has had the knack of
making the best investments spanning three eras: personal
computers, workstations and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, everyone was convinced that the next big
thing would be interactive digital television. The vision: Happy
families would sit in their living rooms in front of their TVs and
bank, shop, communicate with other people and be entertained. The
living room has so far not proven to be the right place for
interacting with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Missteps like these have led to absurdities like a Florida
market trial in which a Silicon Valley company tried to hook up TV
sets to computer workstations that had been fine-tuned to pump
movies and digital information into homes. The concept failed
because it cost more than many families want to spend: $25,000
each.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson, of course, is that in Silicon Valley the term
``visionary'' usually describes a job title and not an ability. If
you pressure venture capitalists over a meal at Il Fornaio in Palo
Alto, they will confess that they expect a shakeout and acknowledge
that they are concerned about the huge capital flows coming into
the valley.
</P>
<P>
   One consequence can be seen in the remarkable appreciation of
the value of new deals _ there is just too much money chasing too
few great ideas.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment the risks seem to be outweighed by the
incredible opportunities inspired by the emergence of cyberspace.
While everyone was looking the other way, the Internet sneaked up
on Silicon Valley and sent the venture-capital community racing to
finance start-ups like Netscape Communications, Yahoo, Excite,
Infoseek and Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of the Internet has cranked up the valley's economy to
a feverish pitch. Companies like Apple Computer and Sun
Microsystems have been reinvigorated by the boom in Internet
commerce. There are so many new companies being formed that initial
public offerings are no longer the typical outcome for a start-up.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than five times as many companies created each
year as there are available IPO dollars. Consequently, acquisition
has become an endgame for most start-ups, according to Technologic
Partners, a firm that monitors venture capital in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   That in turn has made the valley even more of a technology
hothouse, attracting a new kind of venture backer _ large
technology companies like AT&AMP;T, Lucent, Intel and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, although Intel executives once referred to the valley's
venture community as ``vulture capitalists'' because they would
entice employees away to start to new chip ventures, the company is
now running the valley's largest venture fund, valued at more than
$300 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the boom-time atmosphere, there are signs that the
Internet wave is cresting and that Silicon Valley is entering one
of those periods between new technologies and new industries.
</P>
<P>
   Today there is no certainty about the next big thing after the
Internet, but everyone is looking. Is it wireless data or is the
time finally right for interactive digital television?
</P>
<P>
   Some believe that the valley is on the brink of an epochal
shift, perhaps from the world of electronic to optical computing.
Such a shift has been predicted for many years by some of the
valley's best thinkers. The world of optical computing is much more
in tune with the communications-rich future that now seems all
around.
</P>
<P>
   The common wisdom here, however, is that any new invention is
subject to the ``15-year'' rule: It usually takes at least 15 years
for a new technology to make it from the laboratory to the market.
</P>
<P>
   In a world where timing is everything _ the right investment at
the wrong moment can be just as disastrous as making the wrong bet
_ a venture capitalist can be left with a lot of sleepless nights,
even in the best of times.

<P>
   EVANSTON, Ill. _ As the sun begins its pink descent behind the
neo-Gothic spire of Deering Library, two barefoot students lazily
toss a Frisbee across a great expanse of lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Four flights up, in Northwestern University's Leverone Hall, 18
students and a professor are gathered around a classroom table.
</P>
<P>
   The talk this July evening is not of Dante or of the
pre-Socratics. It is of angel investors, price-earnings ratios and
what it means to work for a company so young that its founders
still have no desks or no telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   The students, led by Steven Rogers, a clinical professor of
management, are spending their summer working for start-up
companies in the area in what may turn into full-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
   All the students are in the master's of management program of
Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management, one of scores of
business schools that over the last five years have built programs
and majors in entrepreneurship studies, an arresting mix of the
plainly pragmatic and the utterly ephemeral.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by student and alumni demand, no field is hotter today in
business studies than that of entrepreneurship. Whereas a
generation ago the goal of top MBA graduates was to join a Fortune
500 company and climb the corporate ladder, students' most fervent
desire nowadays seems to be to come up with a marketable idea,
start a company and work for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   According to Murray Low, who directs entrepreneurship studies at
Columbia University, scholarship in the field is exploding.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s there were only a few scholarly journals
devoted to new businesses. Today there are 26, most of them started
in the last five years. In 1980, there were 18 entrepreneurship
chairs at business schools. Today there are more than 200.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Katz of St. Louis University, who has been tracking this
growth, says that in a 1991 study of the approximately 300
accredited business schools in the country, a couple dozen were
found to offer some course work in entrepreneurship. Today, about
120 of them offer it as a major.
</P>
<P>
   While defining entrepreneurship studies remains problematic,
scholars in the field agree that its sudden popularity has several
roots. First, the corporate downsizing of the '80s changed the view
that a good corporate job meant long-term security.
</P>
<P>
   Second, technology and globalization have changed the way the
world does business. A product's shelf life has been greatly
reduced, and challenges from remote places mean that companies need
flexibility, which is a challenge for large, formal hierarchies of
traditional corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, scholars say, young people have grown up in an
environment that emphasizes independence and self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrepreneurship is really about the three P's: pride, passion
and perseverance,'' said A. Barry Merkin, a clinical professor of
entrepreneurship at Kellogg. ``It's about risk-taking, boldness and
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The best analogy, Merkin noted, is to sports. ``Intuitive
qualities are essential, but few can reach real heights without
coaching,'' he said. ``There are basic things to learn, like
accounting and finance, but also narrower areas like writing a
business plan, raising capital. I also try to give my students a
feeling of what it is like to go through something like this, the
tensions and frustrations, because folks who go into this without
realizing what they are doing will face nervous breakdowns, heart
attacks and divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   These are not matters, either the business plans or the heart
attacks, most academics with Ph.D.'s want to teach or to study.
There is a lack of reliable data on start-up companies, and without
data it is hard to produce rigorous scholarship, the grist of
academic careers.
</P>
<P>
   This has created a split, because alumni are donating truckloads
of dollars to set up centers and chairs in entrepreneurship, yet
there are no scholars to fill them.
</P>
<P>
   New York University is a good example. Its Stern School of
Business has four endowed chairs of entrepreneurship, two unfilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see entrepreneurship as a word in search of a meaning in the
academic sense,'' said George Daly, Stern's dean. ``Academics sort
themselves into these little silos, and entrepreneurship is not
easily matched for them. But the role being played by small,
innovative enterprises in our society is phenomenal and should be
studied. The challenge is to persuade academics to look beyond
their own boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Business schools are increasingly turning to practitioners
rather than scholars to teach entrepreneurship, either alone or
paired with a more traditional professor. That is why Merkin of
Kellogg is called a ``clinical professor,'' on the model of medical
school professors who are M.D.s rather than Ph.D.'s. This, too, has
caused tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally speaking, tenured professors consider businessmen
without Ph.D's to be lower-life forms,'' said Kenneth P. Morse, the
founder of high-tech ventures and managing director of the
Entrepreneurship Center at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology Sloan School of Management. ``But there were 1 million
start-ups in the world last year, and anyone who wants to be
involved in such a start-up has a lot to learn _ how to pick the
funding, how to give a raise, how not to run out of money. This is
different from what used to be taught.''
</P>
<P>
   Young scholars are beginning to take the plunge. One is Paul A.
Gompers, an associate professor of business administration at
Harvard Business School. Gompers acknowledges the difficulty in
gathering data but says the field is too exciting to allow that to
be a barrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get data from private consulting firms or through large
pension funds or endowments that provide access to their files,''
Gompers said. ``A lot of it is hand-collected. I'm putting together
data on 1,300 firms, collecting a complete financial history, their
boards of directors, scales of compensation to study how they
operate and grow. I have hired 10 to 15 research assistants during
the course of this project over the last two and a half years.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, much of what goes on at entrepreneurship centers
today consists of students going through the motions of setting up
new ventures, and sometimes actually doing the ventures. Business
school has turned into a kind of laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Business-plan competitions, both local and national, have grown
rapidly in scale with students presenting their plans to venture
capitalists and competing for donated prize money to help them set
up companies.
</P>
<P>
   One such winner was Evan Schumacher, a 29-year-old native of
Boston who finished at Northwestern this spring. His plan called
for setting up a software company that tracks global shipping,
freight and customs management for international firms.
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher won the Kellogg competition and took his plan to
Austin, Tex., in May for national finals. He was a finalist, and as
he walked off the stage after his presentation, his wireless
microphone still clipped to his lapel, a man in the audience
approached him and asked how much he needed.
</P>
<P>
   The man became the company's first angel investor, in for
$250,000. The company, Celarix, was born at the end of June in
Chicago. So far, it has raised $500,000 from investors and is
planning to raise another $1 million to $2 million from venture
capitalist firms. A third employee will join the company this
month.

 By TOM REDBURN 
 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   WAYNE, N.J. _ Drive west from Manhattan, through the Lincoln
Tunnel and into the thick of one of the many commercial
bloodstreams that feeds the suburban beast engulfing New York City.
Go about 20 miles from the Hudson River to a nondescript office
building that overlooks a 14-theater multiplex and a warehouse-size
Costco. That is where you'll find, on the third floor, a modest
little company called Audible Inc., which just happens to have
outsize ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   It's an unlikely location, certainly, for a three-year-old
Internet start-up, one that hopes to create a big audience for
something completely different: custom audio information delivered
on demand over the Web to portable devices you can listen to any
time and anywhere, say, while jogging or driving to work.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the guy who founded the company, Donald Katz, who is
46 and the author of three highly acclaimed nonfiction books, is a
rather unlikely entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Katz never marched to anyone's beat but his own. In starting
Audible, he drew on his own experiences as a writer combined with
the thirst to create something new from the seemingly limitless
potential of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Audible seeks to wed the oldest of human technologies, the
spoken word, with the newest of technologies,'' he said with
characteristic ardor. ``We want to be a leader in teaching the
Internet to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Translating that vision into a successful business will not be
easy. Audible is losing plenty of money.
</P>
<P>
   The company has about 35 employees, its own portable player and
a Web site (www.audible.com) where users can immediately download
from a selection of 16,000 hours of copyrighted audio files
containing everything from traditional read-aloud books like Frank
McCourt's ``Angela's Ashes'' ($9) to bundles of advice ($3 to $13)
from the Harvard Business Review and such. For all its success in
building a new infrastructure, however, the company is just
beginning to attract paying customers.
</P>
<P>
   Katz is accustomed to taking risks. For two decades, from the
time he left graduate school at the London School of Economics in
1975, Katz was a free-lance journalist.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '80s, Katz turned his attention to money and
business. Originally from Chicago, he decided to write a book about
Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Company, his hometown giant.
</P>
<P>
   Sears, the once-great store of the American middle class and one
of the most secretive corporations in the country, was in the midst
of an immense crisis. Katz persuaded Edward Telling, its chief
executive, to give him carte blanche access to the company. The
book, ``The Big Store,'' took six years to research and write.
</P>
<P>
   Katz followed with two other books that also required him to
open closed doors, one a look at the post-World War middle-class
experience told through a single extended family that revealed its
most intimate secrets, and the other an inside look at Nike and its
reclusive chairman, Phil Knight.
</P>
<P>
   In business, surprisingly, Katz did find a subject worthy of
epic treatment. And he discovered he had a taste for it.
</P>
<P>
   With Ed Lau, his college roommate who moved into the computer
industry, Katz began to develop an idea for a business that would
deliver radio programs and audio books through the Internet. His
next book project, on the convergence of digital technologies, was
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something I couldn't write into reality,'' Katz said.
``I had to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He found a fresh outlet for the powers of persuasion that had
opened so many doors in his writing career. The first big convert
was Tim Mott, now a wealthy private investor in Ketchum, Idaho, who
is renowned in Silicon Valley as a co-founder of Electronic Arts,
the computer-game maker, and Macromedia, a software company
specializing in multimedia graphic-design applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get calls all the time about start-up ideas, and I probably
look at least one business plan a week,'' Mott said. ``Over the
course of five years, I've seen, maybe, four that I wanted to
commit money and time. This was one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   With Mott as chairman, they made the round of venture-capital
firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim's business experience and Don's visionary ideas were a
powerful combination,'' said Kevin Compton, a partner at Kleiner
Perkins who became their chief backer there. ``Three minutes into
conversation you could just feel his passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Audible is built around the premise that lots of people are
willing to pay regularly to fill their time _ on the go _ with
constantly changing packages of verbal packages of entertainment,
news and practical advice.
</P>
<P>
   Even more promising is the potential for pumping millions of
mobile workers full of management information, corporate training
and ``time-shifted'' business news while traveling.
</P>
<P>
   To make all that possible, Audible had to design its own
portable player. It is roughly the size and shape of an electric
razor, holds two hours of audio and plugs into a personal computer
through a cradle similar to one used in hand-held computers. People
can carry the battery-powered gadget anywhere, listen to it through
headphones or play clips in a car stereo system.
</P>
<P>
   Programs are stored on a computer, ready to refill the player as
soon as it is returned to its cradle, which remains attached to the
computer.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, though, the player is also an Achilles heel. It
is relatively expensive, costing $200 as a stand-alone purchase.
Two hours is not enough storage time, particularly since lots of
audio books run three to four hours. And it is not easy for the
technologically challenged to try.
</P>
<P>
   To overcome these drawbacks, Audible is developing a
second-generation player with greater abilities and is exploring
new pricing plans similar to those used to sell mobile-phone
services, in which buyers would receive the player at a steep
reduction if they sign up for a subscription.
</P>
<P>
   Relying mostly on word of mouth, Audible says it has attracted
more than 5,000 customers and shipped about 3,000 players. Those
using the player spend an average of about $20 a month on fresh
content.
</P>
<P>
   But Audible's real ace in the hole is not the player but the
rights it has painstakingly sewn up with dozens of content
providers. It is introducing new programs _ from an audio digest of
The Wall Street Journal to National Public Radio's ``Fresh Air''
program _ that will be sent automatically to a subscriber's
computer.
</P>
<P>
   And it will adapt all Audible's products so they can be played
on a variety of portable devices, beginning with the hand-held
organizers powered by Microsoft's Windows CE software.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the recent stock-market turmoil, Audible's outside
investors, who own about 56 percent of the company (the founders
and employees own the rest) remained cautious about going public,
insisting they do not intend to sell stock until the company is
generating a growing and predictable revenue stream.
</P>
<P>
   Which is a good thing, given the uncertainty about even the most
promising Internet ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no in-between,'' said Paul Hawken, the author of
``Growing a Business'' and an entrepreneur who co-founded Smith &AMP;
Hawken, the mail-order garden-supply company. ``Either Audible will
be a billion-dollar-plus company or it will be wallpaper. I suspect
it will be the former.''

   Whenever I look at my bank statement, I think of Ken Hakuta, aka
Dr. Fad. Best known as the inventor of the Wacky Wall Walker, he
made some $20 million from slime-covered plastic creatures that
ooze down vertical surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of it is that Hakuta didn't even come up with the
idea: All he did was license the toy from Japan for a tiny fraction
of the amount he made. Now he's a millionaire and is a prominent
figure on the lecture and convention circuits.
</P>
<P>
   With one simple idea he achieved the American dream _ money and
fame.
</P>
<P>
   There are countless Hakutas _ inventors of the pet rock, sliced
bread, the rolling lint remover, the better mousetrap. And I want
to be one. But I'm too busy writing articles like this one to
follow up on any get-rich-quick schemes, and I can't seem to put
the energy into starting a corporation dedicated to carrying out my
ideas. So I have decided to give them away.
</P>
<P>
   1. Some clever wag has beaten me to the idea of portable gyms:
trainers who park outside your home in vans full of exercise
equipment. But no one has come up with portable baby sitters. Tired
of having to constantly call home during a dinner date to check on
your child or to leave a movie early to deal with a small
emergency? With a portable baby sitter, your child can follow you
around on your date or outing in an RV with toys, a bed and a
licensed sitter. Now you can look in on your little one during
theater intermissions and deal with a crisis without abandoning
your plans.
</P>
<P>
   2. Copyright millennium slogans or register Web site domain
names that corporations will eventually want to buy from you. Some
examples of slogans include ``A new car for a new millennium'' or
``Relief for the morning after the millennium.'' For Web sites, you
could try to cut yourself in on a piece of Mr. Hakuta's millions
and register a wackywallwalker.com.
</P>
<P>
   3. The inventions of tow ropes and chairlifts revolutionized
skiing, enabling entrepreneurs to open ridiculously overpriced ski
resorts. So where are the surf resorts? Tow ropes, jet skis and
above-water conveyer belts could drop surfers off at their favorite
wave and save them from exhausting, time-consuming paddling. Of
course, some surfers will complain that paddling to the wave is
integral to the sport, but soon surfing anywhere besides a resort
will seem as antiquated as hiking uphill to ski.
</P>
<P>
   4. The best entrepreneurs come up with products nobody has heard
of and then persuade the public that it can't live without them.
Here is my candidate: by developing a system to measure the sense
of smell (akin to the eye-chart test), an entrepreneur can make a
fortune by inventing smelling aids for people with deficient
olfactory nerves.
</P>
<P>
   5. Create a line of address books, cell phones, wallets and
purses that, like cordless telephones, beep when they're lost. Even
better, for obsessive message-checkers not satisfied with pagers,
devise a key chain or a small toy that lights up whenever their
answering machine takes a call. In addition, a huge market has
opened up in Japan for cellular phone accessories that could be
exploited in America: different styles of straps and antennae,
trinkets to make phones ring differently and lights that flash when
the phone rings.
</P>
<P>
   6. Become an apartment broker in a competitive city like New
York or San Francisco. But instead of representing realtors or
buildings, start a trustworthy company that represents renters.
They can tell you exactly what they want, then you find it and pay
a deposit to reserve the apartment until they can see it. To corner
the market, you could pay apartment owners a fee to give you a copy
of their listing on the same day they send it to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   7. There are sperm banks, but no public egg banks. These would
be for working women who don't want to have children until they
retire. This way, women can finally stop the ticking of that
biological clock by depositing an egg when they're in their 20s or
30s. The egg will then be preserved until a woman is ready to rear
a child.
</P>
<P>
   8. The best ice cream in the world is Bertillon, a French
delicacy with flavors so precise that anyone marketing it in
America could revolutionize the ice-cream business the way Jelly
Bellys cornered the jelly bean market. This is not a joke, but a
way to a better society.
</P>
<P>
   9. One reason people drive when they're drunk is because they
don't want to have to take a cab home and then wake up in the
morning without their car. By creating an 800-IM-DRUNK line in
car-oriented cities like Los Angeles and Dallas, this problem could
be solved. The service would actually drive a chauffeur to a
restaurant, club or house to take the inebriated client home (or
even to another bar or party) in his or her own car.
</P>
<P>
   10. I was recently notified that someone had taken my idea of
making custom fortune cookies for parties. But kids' dolls could be
personalized in a similar way by having a talking toy like Tickle
Me Elmo or Teletubby and replacing its voice chip with a homemade
one. It could either have personalized messages (``Get to work,
George'') or just undoll-like comments. (``Gee whiz, cover up your
bellybutton, it looks obscene.'')
</P>
<P>
   Space prohibits me from elaborating on more ideas. But with
hundreds of thousands of people reading this, it seems very likely
that within the next 24 hours these baker's-dozen recommendations
will soon be patented and put into development.

 &HT;    
 By JON PARELES 
 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   When Bettina Richards was an artist-and-repertory executive for
big recording companies, she didn't like the way they treated
musicians. Her favorite bands were ignored if they weren't best
sellers; one lead singer, who went on to make a gold album, was
told he shouldn't be singing at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't happy,'' Richards said. ``I was making money, but I
couldn't talk to anyone about the great show I saw last night or
the great record I found. It was a job.''
</P>
<P>
   So in 1992, she started her own company: Thrill Jockey Records,
named after a gang of delinquents in a B movie. It would release
music she cared about and let the musicians decide what to release,
how to package it and run their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted a company where the artists' expectations and the
labels' abilities were in line,'' she said. ``I don't think major
labels are inherently evil or out to destroy the world. I just
don't happen to use music that fits their system.''
</P>
<P>
   That music, Richards said, is simply ``what I like.'' Thrill
Jockey is a leading outlet for what some critics have named
``post-rock'': instrumentals that elude categorization as jazz, pop
tunes or dance music. The label's best-selling band is Tortoise,
whose most recent album has sold nearly 100,000 worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   But Thrill Jockey has also released albums by the
neo-Appalachian duo Freakwater, two women who sing about hard
times; the electronic group Oval, which has built compositions on
the sounds of skipping CDs; and the Nerve, a peppy alternative-rock
band.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of freaky, left-of-center stuff that she puts out,
but at the same time there's a big enough audience so that she can
make a living,'' said Nic Harcourt, the creative music director of
KCRW-FM in Santa Monica, Calif., and the host of the station's
``Morning Becomes Eclectic,'' a program that the music business on
the West Coast follows closely.
</P>
<P>
   In six years, Thrill Jockey has released 60 albums (both as CDs
and old-fashioned vinyl LPs), singles and EPs. All but three
releases have broken even or turned a profit. By contrast, 80
percent to 90 percent of albums from major labels post losses.
</P>
<P>
   But Thrill Jockey works on a grass-roots scale, seeking sales in
thousands rather than millions; its typical release breaks even
with sales of 1,500 CDs and 500 LPs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Thrill Jockey's profit was $183,000, and while that
is probably less than what Columbia Records spends on catering, it
is a success story in independent rock.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, Richards, who is 33 years old, did everything
herself, from signing talent to lining up band interviews. Now
Thrill Jockey has three other full-time employees and one part
timer and is about to buy its own small building.
</P>
<P>
   Richards started Thrill Jockey while working four days a week at
Pier Platters, an alternative-rock record store in Hoboken, N.J.
She ran the label from her third-floor walk-up apartment on Avenue
C in Manhattan, carrying mail-order CDs to UPS because she didn't
ship enough to qualify for a pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Her capital was $20,000 from her grandmother, $10,000 from her
father and the $5,000 from her savings account; she has never
needed another infusion. Her business advisers were people who had
started their own labels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was constantly asking advice from people: cheaper places to
press things, ways to cut corners,'' she said. ``One thing about
independently distributed record labels is that you don't get this
competitive feeling. As long as you are willing to reciprocate with
information, people are happy to give it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Richards moved from New York to Chicago, where her main
manufacturer and distributor, Touch and Go, is based. Rent and
taxes are considerably lower than they are in New York, she noted.
</P>
<P>
   Many independent companies are stepping stones for bands that
hope to be discovered by major labels. By contract, the smaller
labels then share in the profits from the major-label releases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to spend my time as a farm label,'' Richards
said. ``From a business standpoint, it would be better to have
bands bound to contracts so I'd get a piece of their future. But I
don't want to make money from a system I don't support.''
</P>
<P>
   Thrill Jockey makes unusually generous deals with musicians.
Once an album breaks even, the label and the musicians each get 50
percent of the gross receipts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the net comes down, they actually get more than me,''
Richards said. Contracts are often literally a handshake.
</P>
<P>
   Richards chooses bands that, she thinks, can benefit from the
scale of her company and will stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``If becoming famous is their primary focus, then we're not the
right label for them,'' she said. ``But if they want to continue to
make music and live off that, then that's a goal we can achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Thrill Jockey records most albums for under $3,000, one
three-hundredth of what a band like U2 spends, and advertises
sparingly. Video clips tend to be made by friends of the bands or
as projects by art students, though they have been shown
occasionally on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Thrill Jockey depends largely on the unpaid promotion of college
radio stations and reviews in the press, but it also uses club disk
jockeys and skateboarding magazines to reach consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each record is totally different,'' Richards said. ``It's not
as if I sold a really great new garbage can or a nice clock. Your
most popular band this year could be completely unpopular next
year. My company has to be flexible and adapt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my company to stay in business and do well,'' Richards
said. ``But the creative stuff was always the motivation that
sparked it. It wasn't, I see a way to make money better. It was, I
can make this artist's experience better.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lot of work,'' Richards added. ``But it never feels
like a job.''

<P>
   Even as children, many of them spotted a business angle nobody
else did, and milked it for all it was worth.
</P>
<P>
   At age 10, Harold S. Blue, now the chairman of Proxymed Inc., a
health-care information-services company in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
figured he could make more money if he hired playmates to shovel
driveways instead of doing the work himself. He paid them $3 of the
$5 he collected and even had the presence of mind to ply his trade
outside his neighborhood so that the mothers wouldn't catch on to
his scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was out of high school, Blue owned and operated two
drug stores.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy growing up in a village in India 100 miles north of New
Delhi, Vinod Gupta, the founder of infoUSA Inc., a seller of
business information in Omaha with projected sales this year of
$250 million, caught frogs at a swamp and sold them to a research
laboratory for lunch money.
</P>
<P>
   In college, he rented entire passenger-train cars to make a
36-hour trip to New Delhi, and then sold seat tickets individually
for a quick 25 percent profit.
</P>
<P>
   Not every successful business owner can boast of such an early
flair for salesmanship. But even those who drifted or were pushed
into entrepreneurial careers seem to have a natural bent for
seizing opportunities that make competitors wonder why on earth
they didn't think of that themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Is that what defines them? They are an eclectic lot who operate
ventures that vary from grocery stores to Internet start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Donald J. Jonovic, a consultant in Cleveland who has advised
hundreds of family businesses, says he never fails to be astonished
by the ``raw diversity'' of American entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at some of them and you ask, `My God, how'd that
happen?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a country that prides itself on individualism and counts
literally millions of entrepreneurs, it is a question worth asking.
Small businesses, roughly defined as ventures controlled by their
founders and taking in less than $250 million in revenue a year,
are an enormous force in the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   But what drives their owners to strike out on their own rather
than take refuge in the predictability and perks of salaried jobs?
</P>
<P>
   The experts, of course, have their views. Jonovic says true
entrepreneurs are marked by a combination of ``tunnel-vision
dedication'' and supreme self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   David G. Winter, a professor of psychology at the University of
Michigan, said they are propelled by a zeal to excel at whatever
they do, a trait he calls ``achievement motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have this optimism, this exuberance, this boldness,''
Winter said, which can take the form of restlessness, especially if
their business grows into a larger, bureaucratic organization they
can't control. If that happens, he said, ``they may be so unable to
deal with it that they get dismissed by their board. Or they may
quit and start all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said entrepreneurs often display a streak of
authoritarianism because they believe their method is the only way
to do things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing their best is what matters most to them, as opposed to a
concern with friendship or power,'' Winter said.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs, he added, tend to come from middle-class
backgrounds, not blue-collar homes or wealthy families, ``which
still view small business as a step downward into vulgar trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonovic said that many entrepreneurs are tightfisted, not out of
greed but because each dollar they earn represents a small fraction
of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew a successful entrepreneur who ended up in a nursing
home and wouldn't pay for a private room because he wanted to keep
his estate above $1 million,'' Jonovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs themselves cite a long list of self-defining
characteristics and attributes: decisiveness, resilience, focus, a
love of battle, a penchant for risk-taking, workaholism, good
social skills.
</P>
<P>
   But as they recount their histories, two core themes leap out,
flip sides of the same coin: They want to be their own boss, and
they show an uncanny knack for detecting opportunities that others
missed.
</P>
<P>
   For most entrepreneurs, it all begins with the realization that
working for somebody else just isn't a choice.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to go it alone can be liberating, but it can also
be scary because it means cutting off the corporate safety net.
</P>
<P>
   Eric B. Segal, the president of the Kenzer Corp., an
executive-recruiting firm in New York, recalls the near-panic he
and his partner, Robert D. Kenzer, felt in the early days of
running their company in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Segal had been a corporate executive in the retail industry, but
quit a high-paying job after he got what he viewed as an
insufficient raise. As he and Kenzer scrambled to find clients, he
said, he kept thinking: Where's the check? Where's Mommy?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are rules you learn from working in big business, but
nobody's prepared for flying without the net until you do it,''
said Segal, who is 55. ``It's frightening. I see a lot of corporate
guys who can't make the conversion.''
</P>
<P>
   But many entrepreneurs insist that the absence of security is a
small price to pay for the freedom to operate at their own pace and
on their own scale.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Yellin, a small-business consultant who works out of her
Manhattan apartment, says she is determined to remain a one-person
show earning just enough money to live comfortably and ``feed my
cat Fancy Feasts.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Yellin is quick to see business possibilities in
humdrum circumstances. A telemarketing specialist who has made an
instructional tape titled ``Warming Up to Cold Calling,'' Yellin,
46, has even figured out how to turn phone pitches she receives at
home to her financial advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of the callers are terrible at selling,'' she said.
``That gives me an opportunity to call their bosses and say, `You
should book me for some training.'''

 By LAURA MANSNERUS 
 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Deborah L. Jacobs, lawyer-turned-writer, gave a heartfelt
compliment to the young man who arrived with his helper to clean
her house in Brooklyn recently: the name of his service was awfully
clever. But she wasn't going to leave it at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you trademarked it?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   He had not, he told Jacobs, who happened to be the author of
``Legal Smarts for Small Business.'' And that answer worried her,
enough that she will not disclose the name of the young
entrepreneur's business until he has finished scurrying around to
obtain trademark protection.
</P>
<P>
   After all, a name that isn't trademarked can be used by someone
else unless the first person brings out expensive legal artillery
to stop the competition.
</P>
<P>
   It was just one example, Jacobs said, of how small-business
owners forge ahead optimistically, figuring that nothing can go
wrong, when they should part with a few hundred dollars, or a few
thousand depending on the legal task, for a lawyer who, by training
and temperament, can anticipate everything going wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``How far can an entrepreneur get without a lawyer?'' she said.
``Pretty far. But it can cost you a lot, a whole lot, later.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers are usually not a happy part of the plan for a new
business. Neither are accountants, investment advisers or other
professionals whose job it is to protect a business from the things
entrepreneurs would rather not think about.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the typical entrepreneurial attitude,'' said Fred S.
Steingold, a lawyer in Ann Arbor, Mich., and the author of ``The
Legal Guide for Starting and Running a Small Business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to get along with their business, and they're not
detail-oriented,'' he said. ``They're impatient. That's what makes
them good entrepreneurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Some tiny service businesses, of course, start and run fine
without professional advice; a dog walker or a window washer can
obtain a business license (and probably should in many cities, for
tax reasons), file a Schedule C and never pay for a consultation.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a retail or a professional business, Jacobs said, ``as a
sole proprietor you can absolutely hang out your shingle without
consulting a lawyer, although if you're operating out of your house
you might want to check the zoning rules.''
</P>
<P>
   But any other form of ownership _ partnership and any type of
corporation _ requires legal and probably accounting guidance.
</P>
<P>
   On the complexity scale, the simplest is a partnership, which
most experts say should begin with a written agreement spelling
out, for example, what happens if one owner dies or quits the
business. This is well-charted territory, especially since the
Uniform Partnership Act governs in almost all states, and by
following legal guides for the general public and form books that
contain standard agreements, most people can do the paperwork and
whatever modifications they want.
</P>
<P>
   But even Steingold, whose publisher, Nolo Press, produces
self-help books and software, suggests that a lawyer review an
agreement. He gives the same advice for forming a simple
corporation _ with the preliminary note that owners might want to
first ask a lawyer whether they need to incorporate.
</P>
<P>
   (The main advantage, ordinarily, is protection of the individual
owners from legal liabilities. There are tax advantages and
disadvantages, too, best sorted out by an accountant.)
</P>
<P>
   The paperwork _ state filing papers, articles of incorporation
and shareholder provisions _ is manageable for most people; Nolo
Press, among others, publishes general guides and versions specific
to several states, including New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   Having a lawyer review the documents is fairly painless: in
Steingold's case, about an hour of his time, or $175. For handling
the whole process, his flat fee in most cases is $600. (In big
cities, where costs are generally higher, charges can run as high
as $2,000.)
</P>
<P>
   As for buying a business, whatever you plan to do, Steingold
said, self-education and self-representation won't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need advice on whether to buy the assets or just the
corporate shell,'' he said. ``The typical purchase agreement is
pretty complicated. There are all kinds of decisions about how it's
going to be financed. Then there are 10 to 20 documents that show
up at a closing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people, he said, will come into a lawyer's office with a
proposed sales contract that originated with the seller or came
from a form book, ``but it would be difficult for somebody who
doesn't have any legal experience to go through a closing.''
</P>
<P>
   Do-it-yourself accounting is not recommended either, but
entrepreneurs can keep bills down by doing the prep work. Software
programs offer simplified bookkeeping tasks and enable people to
monitor cash-flow statements and projections.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone starting a business should be thoroughly immersed in
those numbers anyway, said Ginny Beauchamp, the vice president of
the National Association for the Self-Employed in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Beauchamp added, however small the business, ``having an
accountant do audits a couple times a year is a very good idea, and
if your business is growing by leaps and bounds, obviously you need
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the simplest sole proprietorships can do without
accountants for tax planning and preparation. Businesses can get in
trouble for failing to keep up with changes in tax law, as many did
several years ago when they failed to amend their Keough plans.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a quarter of small-business owners were delinquent in
filing new plans with the Internal Revenue Service, many because
they were unaware of the new requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs said small-business owners, whether through
cost-consciousness or hopeful ignorance, make two mistakes in
circumventing lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   First, she said, they wave off legal advice until they are in
trouble. She mentioned the entrepreneur who spent hundreds of
thousands of dollars making a CD-ROM called ``The First Electronic
Jewish Bookshelf.'' His product brought a warning letter from
Microsoft, which was using the term ``bookshelf.'' At that point,
the entrepreneur had to get a lawyer and enter extremely expensive
settlement negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Second, she said, ``many attempt to play amateur lawyer.''
Jacobs recommends self-help books to pare legal costs and identify
business concerns. Nolo's, she advised, ``are very well researched
and well written and provide great background.'' Even after
practicing law for six years, she does not hesitate to hire others.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I need a specialized kind of legal help, I hire the best
expert I can,'' she said. ``I would no sooner be an amateur in the
legal field than I would be an amateur electrician and rewire my
house.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's National Banned Books Week _ a good time to pick up a book
that has been banned and read it. It will undoubtedly be better
reading than Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr's report on President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Try Ray Bradbury's ``Fahrenheit 451,'' or Ernest Hemingway's ``A
Farewell to Arms,''''or John Steinbeck's ``Of Mice and Men,'' or
Maya Angelou's ``I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,'' or J.D.
Salinger's ``Catcher in the Rye,'' or Kurt Vonnegut's
``Slaughterhouse Five,'' or Alice Walker's ``The Color Purple.''
They have all been banned somewhere in America at one time or
other.
</P>
<P>
   Lest we forget how precious a liberty we have in our ``freedom
to read,'' bookstores, libraries, civil liberties organizations,
colleges and universities around the nation will be hosting
numerous literary events this week to celebrate the importance of
the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The dangers of censorship are ever with us _ as novelist Judy
Blume put it, ``The censors never sleep.'' There are always those
who would slap a book out of our hands because they consider it
sinful, trash or dangerous. Yes, even a masterpiece like Goethe's
``The Sorrows of Young Werther'' which was based on real events
surrounding the suicide of young Karl Wilhelm Jerusalem, was banned
because various government agencies in Germany, Denmark and Spain
thought the novel recommended suicide. It doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   The multitude of rationales behind the censorship of great
literature is almost as fascinating as the works themselves. And
fortunately, the publishing house, Facts On File, Inc., has
provided a sweeping yet in-depth look at the history of book
censorship around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the company published ``Banned Books,'' a
four volume set edited by author Ken Wachsberger: ``Literature
Suppressed on Political Grounds'' by Nicholas J. Karolides,
``Literature Suppressed on Religious Grounds'' by Margaret Bald,
``Literature Suppressed on Sexual Grounds'' by Dawn B. Sova, and
``Literature Suppressed on Social Grounds'' also by Dawn B. Sova.
The entire set costs $112; each volume can be purchased separately
for $28.
</P>
<P>
   If you were to list 10 of your favorite books, chances are that
at least one was banned. The Bible? The Bible is one of the most
banned books in history. It was banned by the Catholic Church,
banned and burned in England, banned and burned by the Spanish
Inquisition, offending portions excised in expurgated editions, and
challenged in West Shore schools, Pa., in 1993, for containing
``language and stories that are inappropriate for children of any
age, including tales of incest and murder.''
</P>
<P>
   As Wachsberger points out in his introductions to the four
volume set: ``It is illuminating to discover in these histories
that such cultural landmarks as the Bible, the Koran, the Talmud
and the greatest classics of world literature have often been
suppressed or censored, from the same motives, and by similar
forces, as those we see today being used to censor such books as
`The Catcher in the Rye' or `Slaughterhouse Five.'''
</P>
<P>
   Example from ``Literature Suppressed on Political Grounds'':
</P>
<P>
   George Orwell's novel ``1984'' explores a totalitarian world of
the future. It was published in London and the United States in
1949 at the beginning of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   According to national surveys, ``1984'' has been one of the most
frequently challenged books in the America. Ironically, the novel
was often challenged on the grounds that it is pro-Communist
propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   Example from ``Literature Suppressed on Religious Grounds'':
</P>
<P>
   Charles Dickens' second novel ``Oliver Twist'' about an orphan
who falls into the hands of a gang of thieves was published in
monthly installments in a London magazine in 1837. The leader of
the gang is a sinister man named Fagin whom Dickens calls ``a very
old shriveled Jew.'' The anti-Semitic image of a gangster Jew
caused protests and attempts to censor the novel ever since its
publication.
</P>
<P>
   Dickens claimed that Fagin was based upon Ikey Solomons, a Jew
who dealt in stolen goods and was tried in 1830. However, upset
about the charge that he was anti-Semitic, Dickens began revising
``Oliver Twist'' in 1867 in order to eliminate most of the
references to Fagin as ``the Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, a group of Jewish parents in Brooklyn, N.Y., sued the
New York City Board of Education to have the book banned from the
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The parents lost.
</P>
<P>
   Example from ``Literature Suppressed on Sexual Grounds'':
</P>
<P>
   Leo Tolstoy's short novel of celibacy, ``The Kreutzer Sonata''
was banned in Russia by Czar Nicholas II for ``immoral content'' in
1889. The protagonist Posdnicheff confesses to killing his wife,
whom he suspected of committing adultery. Posdnicheff rants against
lust and sexuality and claims that marriage only hides the sins of
the flesh.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. postmaster general banned the novella from distribution
in the mail after an assistant attorney general declared the book
to be ``of an obscene character.'' The New York Society for the
Suppression of Vice called it pornographic because it spoke of lust
and prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   Example from ``Literature Suppressed on Social Grounds'':
</P>
<P>
   Bradbury's ``Fahrenheit 451'' portrays a future society in which
books are forbidden and the job of firemen is to burn all books
they find.
</P>
<P>
   Ballentine Books originally published the novel in 1953, but in
1967 brought out a special edition to be sold to high schools.
Without informing Bradbury or putting a note in the edition, the
publisher modified 75 passages in the novel in order to eliminate
words like ``hell,'' ``damn'' and ``abortion.'' The expurgated
edition was sold for 13 years before a friend of Bradbury's alerted
him to the problem. Bradbury demanded that Ballentine withdraw the
version and replace it with the original. Ballentine agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The publicity generated by the expurgated version of
``Fahrenheit 451'' caused the American Library Association's
Intellectual Freedom Committee to investigate other school books
and to use its considerable economic clout to warn publishers about
expurgations and demand that any excised versions be clearly
identified.
</P>
<P>
   This four volume set on the history of book banning would be a
useful and informative addition to the collections of many public
libraries, colleges and universities. Anyone who wants to research
the nature of censorship would do well to begin here.

ICELANDIC VIOLINIST INGOLFSSON WINS INDIANAPOLIS COMPETITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The International Violin Competition of Indianapolis on Sunday
named Judith Ingolfsson the winner of its fifth contest. Ms.
Ingolfsson, 25, from Iceland, has studied at the Curtis Institute
in Philadelphia and the Cleveland Institute of Music, and has won
awards at other competitions, including the Concert Artists Guild
Competition this year.
</P>
<P>
   The prize carries a cash award of $30,000, a recording contract,
a Carnegie Hall recital and more than 30 engagements in North
America and Europe. Ms. Ingolfsson also won a $1,000 award for the
best performance of Bach.
</P>
<P>
   Liviu Prunaru, 29, from Romania, finished second, and Ju-Young
Baek, 22, from South Korea, finished third. No North American
finished among the six finalists; Jennifer Frautschi, a 25-year-old
American, and Yi-Jia Hou, a 20-year-old Canadian, were among the 10
winners of semifinalists' awards. Forty-six violinists competed.
</P>
<P>
   In the violin world, the Indianapolis competition, which is held
every four years and opened this year on Sept. 11, maintains a
status comparable to that of the Van Cliburn Competition in the
piano world. In no small part, that standing stems from a roster of
winners who have gone on to other significant successes: Mihaela
Martin (1982), Kyoko Takezawa (1986), Pavel Berman (1990) and
Juliette Kang (1994).
</P>
<P>
   The competition was founded in 1982, largely through the efforts
of Josef Gingold, a legendary violin pedagogue, who taught at
Indiana University in Bloomington until his death in 1995. The
competition this year was dedicated to the Gingold's memory, and
the gold medal bore his likeness.
</P>
<P>
   Jaime Laredo was the president of the jury. Other members
included Ms. Takezawa as well as Igor Oistrakh of Russia, Franco
Gulli of Italy, Pierre Amoyal of France and Young Uck Kim of Korea.

 &HT;    The age of 'imageology'
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Czech writer Milan Kundera predicted the victory of
images over ideas in his 1990 book, ``Immortality.'' That victory
is evident in the politics of the Clinton sex scandal. (Americans
know Kundera best for ``The Unbearable Lightness of Being,'' which
was made into a movie.) In a chapter titled ``Imagology,'' Kundera
wrote: ``Ideology was a set of enormous wheels at the back of the
stage, turning and setting in motion wars, revolutions, reforms.
The wheels of imagology turn without having any effect on history.
... The permanent instrument of imagology is the public opinion
poll. ... Public opinion polls have become a kind of higher
reality; they have become the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Kundera's description matches the American political climate,
one in which elected leaders sway from left to righvt and vice
versa, never changing anything, just tracking the popular mood. The
White House, the House Judiciary Committee and Kenneth Starr's
office use tactics comparable to the latest marketing campaign for
hair spray. The president test-markets certain sound bites: ``I
need to get back to work for the American people.'' The House
Judiciary Committee releases confidential grand jury testimony to
take the public pulse before doing its job of sifting through the
evidence to see whether it meets the constitutional criteria for
initiating impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel ignores the role of the grand jury _ to
protect the liberty of citizens under investigation _ and delivers
his own opinion with no input from jurors. He hires a novelist to
colorfully spin the president's sex life.
</P>
<P>
   What a long way we have come from the days of the
Lincoln-Douglas debates, when the clash of great ideas forced
Americans to engage in serious discussion about the direction of a
nation. Now we are captive audiences to the political spinmeisters
that 24-hour news elevates to equal status with serious thinkers:
historians, professors, clergy, respected statesmen and
stateswomen.
</P>
<P>
   With disregard for historical precedent comes the mutation of
democratic institutions such as the constitutional impeachment
process, which is being conducted in an unprecedented partisan
atmosphere that would makes its primary author, Alexander Hamilton,
turn over in his grave.
</P>
<P>
   The media are not blameless for the distortions _ filling the
air 24 hours a day with the easiest-to-understand story, the
imperfections and perversions of peoples' personal lives. Incessant
talk shows skew the relative weight of important national and
international events by making the highly personal their equivalent
through sheer babble and repetition.
</P>
<P>
   Fairness of process is lost.
</P>
<P>
   Should the president of the United States, no matter how wrongly
he acted, be the first citizen to have his confidential grand jury
testimony televised to the world? Is it proper for a prosecutor to
allow grand jurors to become counselors and comforters? (The
questions grand jurors were allowed to ask Monica Lewinsky about
her feelings and the comforting comments they offered her are
totally inappropriate in a legal proceeding.)
</P>
<P>
   The only hope that Kundera's prediction for our democratic
institutions will not become reality is the amazing savvy of the
American people. They continue to indicate they don't want the
president impeached, even though they deplore his personal
behavior. The singular encouraging sign in the whole mess is that
average Americans understand far better than leaders inside the
Washington Beltway that fairness of process is more important to
the health of our democracy than a president who lied to them about
sex.

 &HT;    Director thrives on cutting edge
 &HT;    By Gary Schwan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Veteran film director John Frankenheimer was in awe. Not because
he had won an Emmy Award the night before. Because he was
contemplating a case of ``art meeting life meeting art.''
</P>
<P>
   He earned the Emmy for George Wallace, a TV movie about the
former Alabama governor. Then he learned the morning after the
Sept. 13 ceremony that Wallace had died during the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have ever written that for the movies?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Frankenheimer, whose new film is the big screen action-thriller
Ronin, has a reputation as a staunch Hollywood liberal. Bobby
Kennedy stayed at his home before heading to the Los Angeles hotel
and an assassin's bullet. But Frankenheimer had praise for Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal evaluation of him was pretty much what I put in
the film,'' he said. ``I honestly believe that redemption was
there, a real change of heart'' about racial issues.
</P>
<P>
   Frankenheimer visited the ailing ex-governor before shooting the
movie. ``He was very leery about the film. I didn't try to assuage
his anxiety. I said we were going to try to be as fair as we could
possibly be. He said he hoped that he'd live to see it. We later
got a message that he loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Frankenheimer, in truth. For with made-for-TV movies, he
has found a congenial environment after some rocky years with big
Hollywood studios. The director of The Manchurian Candidate and
Days of Wine and Roses had a string of commercial flops in the
'70s. In the '80s, he had a tough time getting any work at all from
the studios.
</P>
<P>
   So he returned to TV, where he began in the early '50s with CBS.
He has directed four cable movies, including Andersonville and The
Burning Season. George Wallace was created for HBO, and Gary Sinese
and Mare Winningham won Best Actor and Supporting Actress Emmy
awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love doing cable movies. You get such cutting edge material,
and you're not a victim of the star system as you are with big
budget films,'' he said. ``I loved the work I was able to do, and
the conditions I was able to work under _ complete artistic
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankenheimer wasn't griping about the superstars themselves.
He's worked with plenty, including Burt Lancaster in a string of
movies such as Birdman of Alcatraz. In Ronin, he directed Robert De
Niro, and he has nothing but praise. ``Bobby is terrifically
professional _ a very thinking person and a very considerate
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronin is an old-fashioned action-thriller with a postmodern
twist. It's the story of mercenaries from different countries who
are brought together to recover a mysterious briefcase. The men
were once covert operatives. With the end of the Cold War, they're
just unemployed, and they're not fussy about dealing with
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The film combines two of Frankenheimer's interests and strengths
_ psychological studies of people who aren't what they seem, and
racy action. There are several spectacular car chases. The film is
mostly set in Paris, and there's one high-speed chase through
tunnels that may have the audience thinking of Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't, said Frankenheimer. ``Paris is a city of tunnels.
We wanted to portray what makes the city seem unique'' besides the
Eiffel Tower. The tunnel where Diana's accident occurred wasn't
used.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really choreographed those car chases. I used a sketch
artist,'' said Frankenheimer, with real enthusiasm. He also
directed the stylish European racing film Grand Prix. He said
nothing has changed when it comes to filming car chases that are
unaided by high tech wizardry. ``I used the same techniques I did
with Grand Prix _ the same camera set-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankenheimer, 68, was born in New York, the son of a
stockbroker. During the Korean War, he directed Air Force training
films, and got a job as an assistant director with CBS in the early
'50s. Between 1954 and 1960, he directed more than 150 live TV
dramas, many for Playhouse 90.
</P>
<P>
   He's proud of his early TV work.``Everything I learned about
situations, tension and suspense came out of those days in TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his film The Manchurian Candidate is considered a
classic, he says his favorite movie is the The Gypsy Moths with
Lancaster, Deborah Kerr and Gene Hackman. It's the tale of
skydivers in Kansas. ``The subtext really played,'' he said.
``There were three or four different meanings.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankenheimer enjoyed Lancaster. ``He was the most professional
actor I ever worked with. He knew more about everybody's job than
they did. And he had physical presence. He had been a stunt man and
a circus performer. In real life, he talked and carried himself
just as he did on screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankenheimer recalled a visit to Palm Beach ``years ago'' for a
fishing tournament. ``After it was over, they wanted me to stay for
another tournament. That evening, I went to a party with
(socialite) Jim Kimberly. There were 40 or 50 people there, and I
was trying to figure out whether I should stay or not. Then I
looked around the room, and realized that I was the only person who
had to work for a living.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't complaining then _ and he's sure not complaining now.

 &HT;    Latest rumor too embarrassing to be true
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ The rumor mill is at it again and I can't
help wondering; where does all of this stuff begin? Do rumors come
from the same place jokes do?
</P>
<P>
   It's just another rumor of course, but I've been told that most
jokes originate in prisons among inmates with too little to do and
too much time in which to be doing it. This hearsay, I'm thinking,
just might be true. Think sick joke...then think Charles Manson.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the penultimate Clinton rumor suggests that the
president's showbiz friends have a cushy job lined up for him in
Hollywood whenever (and however) his Washington show closes.
There's even rumored to be a big house, not to be confused with
``The Big House,'' waiting for him. ``In the purchase stage'' is
how the press put it, whatever that means.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the rumors are true or not, the insinuation that the
ex-president of the most powerful nation in the world would need a
real job seems almost ludicrous, but think about it. He has bills
to pay and after the Republicans and the media finish with him,
who's going to hire him?
</P>
<P>
   A law firm? Doubtful. Not after his over-exposure on national
television. Who'd take him seriously?
</P>
<P>
   A university? I'm pretty sure that's out of the question too.
Even his alma mater has issued a denial that it was ever Yale's
intention to crank out lawyers as deft in the art of dodging the
truth and parsing words as Mr. Clinton has demonstrated he is
capable of doing. They say it is not representative of the way they
do things.
</P>
<P>
   But an ex-president, particularly one who is so young, has to
have something to do with himself once the White House days (and
nights) are over. So, what's it going to be?
</P>
<P>
   Golf is always a possibility. That's what George and Gerald do.
It's non-controversial and eats up a lot of time. Most important,
it'd keep Bill from hanging around the house and bugging Hillary
about what's for lunch. The problem there is, there's no money in
it and our president is going to need some big bucks if he intends
to be able to pay off his lawyers in this lifetime. The kinds of
legal minds he has working for him don't come cheap. Those guys
earn more from one phone conversation than school teachers earn in
a week _ kind of like those girls on the 1-900 phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   And there's another obvious problem. A lot of folks seem pretty
thrilled at the thought of our country's commander-in-chief
groveling and begging forgiveness. I'm not looking forward to it,
and I have the uneasy feeling that before this whole mess is over,
Bill Clinton will have eaten enough crow to keep him spitting
feathers well into his dotage. Too bad Jimmy Carter thought of the
Habitat for Humanity thing first. Photo ops of Bill Clinton with a
</P>
<P>
   hammer in his hand and a mouthful of three-penny nails would
have done wonders to ameliorate his presently sorry lot.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Hollywood is the only place where an ex-president with
Bill Clinton's track record would be viewed as an asset rather than
just another empty suit in just another executive suite. But
somehow the notion seems a mockery of all the presidency should be.
The words, ``Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United
States...'' shouldn't be followed by... ``is alive and well and
working in Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   It's undignified. It's embarrassing. Somehow I had always hoped
for more.

 &HT;    It's the greatest home-run record you never heard about
 &HT;    By Norma Martin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ It's the greatest home-run record you never heard
about.
</P>
<P>
   While America watches rapturously as Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa
battle for the home-run crown, most fans are oblivious to the
record on the books that neither slugger has a prayer of breaking.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936, Josh Gibson, ``the B
</P>
<P>
   abe Ruth of the Negro League,'' hit 84 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   The muscular right-handed catcher hit more balls out of the park
in that season than Roger Maris, or Babe Ruth, or any others likely
ever will. But his is not a household name, because an asterisk
rests beside his record. Some of his homers were hit while playing
nonleague teams.
</P>
<P>
   In a sport where statistics are everything, the footnote on
Gibson's achievement has less to do with what he accomplished 62
years ago than it does with America's racist past. ``Gibson was a
tremendous home-run hitter and he would have challenged Ruth's
record, if he had been given the chance,'' said James A. Riley, a
historian and author of ``The Biographical Encyclopedia of the
Negro Baseball Leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact Gibson played against minor-league teams doesn't
diminish the account of his achievement,'' Riley said. ``He was a
superior baseball player.''
</P>
<P>
   That record wasn't Gibson's only achievement. He had other
impressive home-run feats: 75 in 1931 and 69 in 1934. In his
17-season career, Gibson is given credit for 962 home runs. Hank
Aaron holds the major-league record with 755 home runs in a
23-season career. Even if you eliminate the games in which Gibson
faced nonleague opponents, it's likely he hit more than 60 home
runs in the summers of 1936 and 1931, Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a very impressive achievement, on par with Ruth,
Maris, Big Mac and Sosa.''
</P>
<P>
   At the turn of the 20th century, black baseball players were
forced out of white leagues by America's Jim Crow laws. Some black
teams had been around since the 1880s and more formed in the
century's early years. It was a rag-tag, barnstorming game format
until 1920. That's when Andrew ``Rube'' Foster, a former player,
organized the first successful league, with eight teams. For the
next 35 years, six different Negro Leagues were created for nearly
80 teams. The leagues operated like their white counterparts, with
a tiered system. There were both major- and minor-league teams. In
the Negro Leagues, Gibson played for the Pittsburgh Crawfords and
the Homestead Grays, both major-league teams.
</P>
<P>
   With black and white leagues firmly segregated, the nation's
large daily newspapers _ run by whites _ ignored the Negro Leagues.
The black-run press, mostly weeklies, covered the black
major-league teams, but the papers were hampered by publishing
delays and inconsistencies in reporting the essential information:
box scores. As a result, statistics for black teams and their
players are not irrefutable.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the Negro League teams had to fill out their season's
schedules of 200 or so games. Major-league games needed to be
played on major-league fields, but that wasn't always possible. The
Negro League teams had to rent fields from their white
counterparts, so while black teams were waiting for a field, they
often ended up playing minor-league teams to make a payday, Riley
said. ``The black owners didn't have a lot of money and operated on
a shoestring.''
</P>
<P>
   In some lean years, Negro League players, including Gibson, took
their talents south of the border. Gibson spent a season playing
for the Vera Cruz team in the Mexican League, gaining fans in the
Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Cuba and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   It was those types of games that left Gibson's home-run record
with a mark indicating that his achievement isn't equal to that of
his white counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to look back with nostalgia on our sports heroes. The
fact is, the Negro Leagues had as many superstars as the white
league, yet when we talk about great feats, such as the home-run
chase, stars such as Gibson aren't discussed because of the lack of
documentation,'' said Kevin Grace, director of the Baseball
Research Collection at the University of Cincinnati and teacher of
a course on the social history of baseball. ``You don't need to be
a baseball fan to know that Josh Gibson is one of the greatest
baseball players of all time,'' Grace said. ``The fact that people
don't (know) has everything to do with American society.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's to say the white major leagues were better than the
Negro Leagues?'' said Dwayne E. Williams, an assistant professor of
history at Pennsylvania's Susquehanna University who specializes in
sports history. ``If you're talking the quality of competition,
Babe Ruth's 60 home runs were not as impressive in that he wasn't
competing against the best of Negro League players, such as
Gibson.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibsonbegan to gain attention as a neighborhood athlete in
Pittsburgh, where his father worked in a steel mill.
</P>
<P>
   In his youth, Gibson built a reputation for hitting powerful
homers on the sandlots, according to several published accounts.
Although he dropped out of high school to work in the steel mill,
Gibson turned to baseball at the age of 18, signing with the
Homestead Grays in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Biographical Encyclopedia'' describes the 6-foot-1-inch,
215-pound player's batting stance as ``a semi-crouched, flat-footed
stance and without striding generated a compact swing that produced
tape-measure home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a natural hitter,'' Riley said. ``He was a big,
powerful man. Of course, they didn't have body builders back then.
McGwire reminds me of him. Gibson hit the majestic runs, like Ruth
and McGwire.''
</P>
<P>
   One legend about Gibson is that he batted a ball out of old
Yankee Stadium, 461 feet from center field, although biographers
and sports historians say that's a myth.
</P>
<P>
   It is fact, however, that ``Gibson smashed a ball over Forbes
Field's center field fence, 457 feet away. Only three other men _
Oscar Charleston, Mickey Mantle and Dick Stuart _ ever duplicated
that feat,'' wrote John B. Holway in an April 1997 American History
magazine article.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gibson's triumphs came with tragedies. His 18-year-old wife
died shortly after delivering twins, Josh Jr. and Helen.
</P>
<P>
   His son worked as a bat boy and then a player in the Negro
Leagues, said Raymond Doswell, curator at the Negro Leagues
Baseball Museum in Kansas City, where Gibson's image is one of 12
life-size bronze sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   When Gibson was posthumously inducted into the Baseball Hall of
Fame in 1972, Josh Gibson Jr., who lives in Pittsburgh, accepted
the honor on his father's behalf. Like many baseball players of his
day, Gibson led a rough life. He didn't shy from fights and brawls
and, like Ruth, hewas plagued by alcoholism that would haunt him
all his life.
</P>
<P>
   In the later years of his career, Gibson's body was broken under
the physical demands of having played thousands of games. He played
his last season in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had been catching year around, playing some 200 games in
the winter and summer,'' Riley said. ``His knees were bad and he
had other health problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson died Jan. 20, 1947, at his home. He was 35. The cause of
his death has been listed as either a stroke or brain tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Three months after Gibson's funeral, Jackie Robinson walked on
the Brooklyn Dodgers' Ebbets Field. The race barrier had been
breached. Eight years later, the Negro Leagues were disbanded.

 &HT;    Planning to move? Visit the Web first
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Being an American is a moving experience. Most of us move
several times during our adult life, and a few of us seem to move
more often than most carnivals.
</P>
<P>
   The World Wide Web can help make your next move more
comfortable. While the Web is an effective way to find movers and
even shop for real estate, we'll leave that for another day and
take a look at how the Internet can help you settle comfortably in
your new home.
</P>
<P>
   If you live in a large metropolitan area, your first chore,
after buying the home, will be showing friends and relatives how to
get there. The Web offers help here in the form of a service
offered by Yahoo! Just set your browser for
http://maps.yahoo.com/py
</P>
<P>
   /maps.py and punch in the street address of your home. In
seconds, you'll have a full-color map. You can zoom in and out to
find major streets.
</P>
<P>
   Two added features, available once you've created the map,
including the site's ability to provide turn-by-turn driving
directions from an address locally or in another city. But if
you've ever tried to learn a new neighborhood _ finding a new
grocery, cleaners, restaurants, libraries and the like _ you'll
really appreciate the second feature.
</P>
<P>
   Just select the category of business and click on the button
labeled Find Nearby Businesses. You'll get a complete list in that
category (groceries, restaurants, nightclubs, service stations, you
name it), along with the distance of that business from your new
home.
</P>
<P>
   But there's still more. You can, if you wish, click on the name
of the business and you'll get a map showing where it is located
along with the option of getting turn-by-turn driving directions
from your new home.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking improvement
</P>
<P>
   Now that you know how to use that feature, you'll undoubtedly
want to get directions to the nearest home improvement store. No
matter how well cared for your new house or apartment is, there are
undoubtedly some small things that you'll want to take care of
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   First-time homeowners may need a little extra advice. And even
veterans enjoy comparing tips with others. Both newcomers and home
handymen will find something worthwhile at the HouseNet at
http://www
</P>
<P>
   .housenet.com/. There are sections for home fix-it jobs as well
as information about decorating and home security, and how-to
features on such topics as selecting a good remodeling contractor.
</P>
<P>
   The page also has a section for online shopping, where you'll
find everything from fall bulbs to portable fireplaces.
</P>
<P>
   There are times when you need more than a bulb. Some jobs are
too big for the average homeowner. But the Web can still help by
finding a competent contractor for remodeling and reconstruction
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, you'll find that sort of help at http://www.nari.org
</P>
<P>
   /atlanta/, which is the site for the Georgia Chapter of the
National Association for the Remodeling Industry.
</P>
<P>
   You can search for contractors within your city or neighborhood
here, or follow a link for a free brochure that gives advice on
selecting a contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Those in other areas can use the first part of that address
(simply go to http://www.nari.org) for a site maintained by the
national organization. You'll find remodeling tips here as well as
help finding a contractor for those who live outside Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   While you're there, check out a link called Red Flat that offers
help in watching for signs that the contractor you're interviewing
is two bricks short of a full load.

 &HT;    Garrett wishes he had one pass back
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Dallas quarterback Jason Garrett had three
options on his team's last offensive play of the recent thriller
against Oakland. By all accounts, he made the wrong choice.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett gave his critics plenty to talk about by throwing a
desperation bomb to Billy Davis with 91 seconds remaining in the
fourth quarter. Trailing 13-10, the Cowboys had a legitimate chance
to tie the game or take the lead when they reached Oakland's 43 in
the waning moments.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of completing a game-winning touchdown drive, Garrett
ended any hope of a Dallas victory by throwing an interception into
the hands of Oakland safety Eric Turner at the goal line. The
intended receiver, Davis, had no chance of catching a pass that
sailed over his head.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland was able to run out most of the clock and escape Texas
Stadium with a 13-12 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys were frustrated because Davis was not the only
receiver available. Michael Irvin had run a curl route in the
middle of the field and Deion Sanders was running a short sideline
pattern, but instead of playing it safe with Irvin or Sanders,
Garrett elected to try to win the game with one throw.
</P>
<P>
   One bad throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously if I had to do it all over again, I'd have gone
somewhere else with the football,'' Garrett said.
</P>
<P>
   The pass to Davis should not have been thrown. Turner, sensing
that Garrett was going to throw deep, stayed in front of Davis and
made an easy interception.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett, starting in place of the injured Troy Aikman, said
Turner surprised him by staying deep on the play. He thought the
eight-year safety from UCLA was going to run after Irvin, but
Turner never drifted far from Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were on a different page on that play,'' Dallas Coach Chan
Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like Dallas was confused on offense for most of the
afternoon. Garrett threw two interceptions, the receivers dropped
several passes and the line repeatedly was flagged for false
starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some teams are good enough to win when they make mistakes like
this, but we're not one of them,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most disappointed Cowboys was kicker Richie
Cunningham, who missed a 37-yard field goal early in the third
quarter. He was warming up for a potential game-tying kick when
Garrett threw his late interception.
</P>
<P>
   All Cunningham could remember was the kick he botched: ``It's my
job to put points on the board. I let them down. I just didn't do
my job today.''
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: Cowboys rookie defensive end Greg Ellis had the first
sack of his NFL career. ... Michael Irvin became the 10th player in
NFL history to reach 11,000 career receiving yards. ... Heisman
Trophy winner Charles Woodson recorded the first interception of
his career, stopping a Dallas drive in the end zone in the third
period. ... The Cowboys will travel to Washington for an NFC East
game on Sunday.

 &HT;    Smith a victim again in loss to Raiders
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ For much of his career, Dallas cornerback Kevin
Smith has been a victim. If he isn't being whistled for pass
interference, he often is getting dusted by an opposing receiver.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent Oakland game, Smith simply was a victim of dumb
luck.
</P>
<P>
   The Oakland Raiders used a 75-yard touchdown reception by James
Jett to beat Dallas 13-12 before 63,544 fans at Texas Stadium.
Every highlight reel captured Jett catching a ball that deflected
off Smith's left shoulder on a deep route in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland's only touchdown of the steamy afternoon was all the
Raiders needed to beat the mistake-prone Cowboys on enemy turf.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Smith always seems to be the Cowboys defender who is
tagged with such misfortune. And he's sick and tired of being
singled out as the player who busted a play.
</P>
<P>
   When someone mentioned that Smith seemed to have good defensive
position on Jett's score, Smith countered, ``Is that what you're
going to write in your story?''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Smith seemingly had good coverage when Oakland
quarterback Jeff George threw a spiral down the right sideline. But
Smith did not see the ball until it hit his shoulder pad. Jett,
running in stride, caught the carom and ran easily to the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jett runs the 40 in 4.1 (seconds),'' Smith said. ``There's
nothing to be ashamed of.''
</P>
<P>
   Jett's touchdown catch was symbolic of Oakland's victory. In a
game filled with big plays, the ball always seemed to bounce in the
Raiders' direction.
</P>
<P>
   The George-to-Jett play was the most significant part of
Oakland's victory. By most accounts, Smith played well, but one
critic noted that the veteran from Texas A&AMP;M did not see the ball
quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
   Jett's touchdown with 1 minute, 14 seconds left in the second
quarter gave Oakland a 10-3 halftime edge. It was a lead the
Raiders never relinquished.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coverage was good,'' Dallas Coach Chan Gailey said. ``I
wish he had looked up a half-second earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Jett, meanwhile, could not believe his good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball was a little short and (Smith) overran it,'' Jett
said. ``Once it hit him, I just grabbed the ball and started
running.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas (2-2) made a valiant comeback late in the game, but it
wasn't enough. With the Cowboys trailing 13-10 with less than 2
minutes remaining, Jason Garrett's desperation throw to Billy Davis
at the goal line was intercepted by Oakland safety Eric Turner.
</P>
<P>
   That was the final straw in an ugly game for the home team.
Garrett passed for 222 yards for the second straight game, but he
made enough mistakes to keep the Cowboys from winning.
</P>
<P>
   In a solemn locker room, no players had more to ponder than
Smith and Garrett, Sunday's scapegoats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to put ourselves in a position to win, and we didn't
do that enough today,'' Garrett said.
</P>
<P>
   One week after leading Dallas to an easy win over the New York
Giants, Garrett resembled a second-string quarterback who needs
more polish. He threw an untimely interception to Oakland's Charles
Woodson, made countless other bad decisions, and ended the game
with his poorly thrown pass that Turner picked off.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get into position to win the game, we have to close
the deal,'' Davis said. ``We played on our heels in the red zone
and we can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the mistakes, penalties and mental miscues, Dallas
still had a chance to win when it received the ball on its own 20
with 3:15 to go. Trailing 13-10, Garrett hit Michael Irvin with a
critical 17-yard pass and later found Davis on the right sideline
for 14 more.
</P>
<P>
   But on a first-and-10 play from the Oakland 43, Garrett decided
to throw to Davis deep. It was easy to second-guess his decision
after Turner outran Davis and made the easy interception.
</P>
<P>
   For Oakland (2-2), it was the most important defensive stop of
the young season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big win for our football team,'' first-year Raiders
coach Jon Gruden said. ``We will celebrate on the ride home. We set
some goals before the season and one of them was to improve, and
we've been able to do that so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakland was able to stay alive with a solid running game, led by
running back Napoleon Kaufman. He kept the Cowboys busy, dodging a
tackler for 116 yards on 24 carries. The entire Dallas rushing
attack produced only 68 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good to come in and beat the Cowboys,'' said Oakland
defensive tackle Russell Maryland, a former Cowboy. ``For us to
leave here at 2-2 is a pretty good accomplishment for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis set up Dallas' only touchdown with a 55-yard catch in the
closing minutes. Emmitt Smith scored on a 1-yard run to slice
Oakland's lead to 13-10.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas concluded the scoring when Oakland punter Leo Araguz
purposely ran out of the end zone with two seconds left in the
game, giving the Cowboys a meaningless safety. With the victory
Oakland has a 4-3 series lead against the Cowboys.

 &HT;    Koreans to clone Apple's popular gum drop iMac
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You know the iMac is a success when the Koreans want to clone
it. And that's exactly what is happening.
</P>
<P>
   Two South Korean companies have announced they've formed a joint
venture to produce an iMac clone. It will mimic the look and ease
of use of Apple Computer's latest computer, which is an all-in-one
unit that looks like an iridescent gum drop.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few things, though, the Koreans don't plan to clone
about the iMac. Their computer, to be called the eMachine, will run
Microsoft's Windows 98 operating system and sell for $499.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac, of course, runs Apple Computer's OS 8 and sells for
$1,299. It has no internal floppy drive, unlike the Korean clone.
</P>
<P>
   The eMachine's makers, TriGem and Data Systems, also plan to
modify their computer's look. It will be taller and not as squat as
the iMac, taking up less desk space. Nor will the eMachine be
transparent and bondi blue. A final decision has not been made on
the eMachine's color, but company executives have said it will
probably be green and ivory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got the space-age look and design just like the iMac,''
Ashok Kumar, analyst at Piper Jaffray, recently told the San Jose
Mercury News. ``But it will have a larger software base and be way
cheaper. What more can you ask for?''
</P>
<P>
   The eMachine is not expected to reach retail shelves until
April, so Apple Computer has plenty of time to adapt and sell more
iMacs.
</P>
<P>
   And boy are they selling. Industry consultant PC Data has
reported that the iMac was the No. 1 selling computer in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (iMac sales) has been absolutely beyond our wildest
dreams,'' Paul Ramirez, a vice president of marketing at California
retailer ComputerWare, told MacWeek.
</P>
<P>
   While slowing somewhat, sales continue to be strong for the
iMac.
</P>
<P>
   Another industry consultant, International Data Corp., is
predicting Apple Computer will sell between 600,000 and 900,000
iMacs this year. If that proves true, Apple Computer will become
the fifth-largest computer maker in terms of worldwide market
share, says International Data. It is currently No. 8.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that could temper the iMac's surge is the Korean
knockoff. Or will Apple Computer find a way to knock off the
eMachine first? The iMac story grows more interesting by the day.

 &HT;    Literature sites shed light on the South
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rich legacy of Southern literature is thriving on the Web.
Choices range from thoughtful, intelligent sites dedicated to some
of the South's most famous authors to journals and publications
dedicated to publishing new authors and fresh looks at the South
moving toward the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   WaySouth (http://www.waysouth.com) describes itself as ``an
Internet journal of original essays and stories from a unique
Southern perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   True to its word, WaySouth stays away from ``magnolia-ridden
cliches.'' Current stories document the hip-hop scene in Atlanta,
the nuances of the Southern accent and a thought-provoking essay
from publisher Grayson Hurst Daughters about George Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   WaySouth is clearly in ancient stages of development, but the
e-zine looks as if it could eventually become a must read for
lovers of literature and the South.
</P>
<P>
   The Brightleaf Review (http://www.brightleaf-review.com/) is the
online version of the print publication. The quarterly publication
features fiction, essays and photographs from well-known and
not-so-well-known Southern writers.
</P>
<P>
   Brightleaf is beautifully designed for the Web with copy and art
in just the right measure. There is also a section of current news
and features planned for upcoming issues.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you'd like to subscribe to the offline publication or
order back issues, you can print out a form to fax or mail back.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Mississippi _ known as Ole Miss in the South _
has an astonishingly complete Web site devoted to the grand old man
of Southern literature, William Faulkner
(http://www.mcsr.olemiss.edu/(tilde)egjbp
</P>

   An excellent resource for both scholars and fans, this
comprehensive site includes everything from a RealAudio greeting
from Faulkner to bibliographies, frequently asked questions,
details of Faulkner's Hollywood years and even a weather report for
the author's fictitious Yoknapatawpha County (it's actually a link
to the Weather Channel's forecast for Oxford, Miss., but why
quibble.). Students will love the extensive commentary and plot
descriptions of all Faulkner's works, trivia questions, parodies
and a wide variety of other information.

   The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill also has an
extensive Southern literature project online called Documenting the
American South (http://sunsite.unc.edu/docsouth/).
</P>
<P>
   The DAS database contains resources on Southern history
literature and culture from the colonial period through the early
part of the 20th century. Available for online perusal are slave
narratives, first-person narratives and a large block of Southern
literature.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to navigate the site is to search the collections
by author, even if you are searching for first-person narratives.
The collection is still in the process of being digitized for the
Web, and this seems like the best way to find out what is available
online.
</P>
<P>
   A quick author search turned up narratives with titles such as
``A Virginia Girl in the Civil War,'' and ``Life of George M.
Horton. The Colored Bard of North Carolina: 1797-1883.'' While the
DAS database isn't cleverly designed or easy to navigate at times,
the glimpses of Southern life it provides make it a site worth
investigating.

 &HT;    Having fun just horsing around
 &HT;    By Yusuf Davis
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sarah Hutchinson of Marietta likes to ride ponies and sometimes
paints with a brush. So getting to review a creativity software,
called ``Paint 'n Play Pony,'' was like hitting the daily double.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM software lets Sarah design, decorate and dress her
own horses or ponies. She can use colors and accessories _ like
blankets, bows, hats and saddles _ to dress up her virtual friend
or she can create and print ribbons, certificates and horse-themed
decorations.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah said she likes the ``P'nP Pony'' software and uses it
often. ``The pictures are good, and the sound is good,'' the
5-year-old said. ``There's nothing bad about it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to paint the pony or horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use the mouse to dip a brush into a pail, then paint,'' said
Sarah, who even adorned a unicorn.
</P>
<P>
   Despite pink packaging that has a distinctly ``girlie'' look,
Sarah's brother Billy tried the activity software. He didn't like
it. The box doesn't say it, but ``Paint 'n Play Pony'' is designed
for girls. Even though it involves horses, which also interest
boys, Billy didn't like the idea of putting flowers, bows and
braids in a horse's mane.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too girlish,'' the 9-year-old said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides painting and decorating it, Sarah likes to feed her pony
apples and carrots she gets from a basket.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah also likes other segments of the program. She can read
stories about horses and ponies, write her own stories (with story
ideas that help her get started) or read stories about famous
horses through history, such as Paul Revere's horse and Pegasus
from Greek mythology.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a section of Fun Facts about the care and breeding
of horses, ponies and their foals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of stuff you can learn,'' Sarah said.
</P>
<P>
   Recommended for ages 5-10.
</P>
<P>
   Available on a hybrid CD-ROM for Windows or Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Minimum system requirements:
</P>
<P>
   PC: Windows 95/98: Pentium 75 MHz or better, 16 megabytes of RAM
or higher, SVGA monitor
</P>
<P>
   (640-by-480, 256 colors), 12 MB hard disk space,
Windows-compatible sound card, Microsoft-compatible mouse, 2X
CD-ROM drive or better, printer
</P>

   Mac: Power Macintosh System 7.1.2, 16 MB RAM or higher, monitor
(640-by-480, 256 colors), 12 MB hard disk space, 4X CD-ROM drive or
better, printer

 &HT;    Knowing a PC's vital statistics, settings can help the
relationship
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've spent a lot of time together but really don't know each
other.
</P>
<P>
   We'll take care of that now. Before the day is over, you'll know
things about your computer that will change the way you think of
her. (By the way, all computers are female. You can take my word on
this one.)
</P>
<P>
   Veteran computer users probably can rattle off all the vital
statistics with the same sort of cocky certainty a Marine uses when
answering a drill instructor's question about his rifle. But the
majority of new computer and even longtime casual computer users
seldom can answer even the most basic question about a computer's
configuration.
</P>
<P>
   So if you're a beginner but tired of digging around for manuals
and the bill of sale when asked questions about your computer,
stick with me for a while. I'll have you and your computer on
speaking terms in no time. Besides the fact you'll feel better
knowing this stuff, knowing the technical details can come in handy
if you ever need to call for technical help.
</P>
<P>
   The first source of information about your computer comes when
you first turn it on. With most machines, a message will flash on
the screen _ before Windows starts _ that tells you the type of
processor you have. However, if that doesn't happen when you turn
your PC on, you'll find information about the processor in your
PC's setup screen.
</P>
<P>
   What? You don't know what the setup screen is? It's the place
where you can find out some of the most basic information about
your machine.
</P>
<P>
   In every case, you'll press a combination of keys (it varies
from computer to computer) while your machine starts to get there.
In the case of my two PCs, you press the Alt and Control and Escape
keys for one, and hold down the Delete key on the other. Directions
for how to get to the setup screen for your computer almost
certainly flash on your machine as it starts up, and you'll also
find them in your manual (if you can find it).
</P>
<P>
   Once you get to the setup screen, copy down the information you
find there or _ if it is an option with your machine _ print it
out. When you've finished, you'll need to restart the computer.
Since any changes you make in the setup can be disastrous, make
sure you take the option of restarting the machine without saving
any changes. That way, even if you hit a key by mistake, no harm
will be done.
</P>
<P>
   After the machine starts up and Windows is loaded, we'll resume
our quality time together.
</P>
<P>
   Double-click on the icon called My Computer and then
double-click to open the Control Panel icon. With most PCs, the My
Computer icon is already in plain sight on your monitor. However,
if you have trouble finding it, click on the Start button and
select Settings and then Control Panel. Now double-click on an icon
called System.
</P>
<P>
   Once that's done, you should see a small window with four tab
settings on top. Select Performance. You'll see how much RAM is
installed on your machine. While that window is still open, press
on the Virtual Memory button and you can see how much free hard
disk space you have.
</P>
<P>
   Now go to the Device Manager tab at the top of the window. Make
sure that the View Devices by Type Setting is selected. You'll see
a small icon for every accessory and device connected to your
computer. If you see any exclamation marks or ``X's'' you'll know
that some of the devices are either not working properly, have
conflicts with another device or have been disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, close the Settings icon and open the icon labeled
Display. Click on Settings. You'll find out the type of video card
that you have installed and _ in some cases _ get information about
your monitor.
</P>
<P>
   OK. That's enough for today. After all, a little mystery is good
for a relationship.

 &HT;    Atlantis rising: Glittery resort still growing on Paradise
Island
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARADISE ISLAND, Bahamas _ The huge Atlantis resort on Paradise
Island will soon be even more enormous.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,200-room, 17-story Royal Towers hotel, which dominates the
island's skyline, will open Dec. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Construction crews are working around the clock to get the hotel
ready in time for the holidays. It will mark the finish of a $450
million expansion that will increase the number of guest rooms to
2,300.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantis, which opened in 1994 after a $250 million
refurbishment of existing hotels and the building of the world's
largest outdoor aquarium, will be a surprise to those who haven't
visited lately.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Royal Towers, there are attractions and
thrills to rival Disney. A ``life-size'' replica of a Mayan Temple
is almost finished. It will have five water slides, two of which
will catapult riders through a clear acrylic tunnel submerged in a
shark-filled lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Leap of Faith slide will give a 60-foot almost vertical drop
from the top of the temple - a sure jolt to the nervous system. The
Serpent Slide, 48 feet up, will spin riders into the black interior
of the temple and emerge through the predator lagoon at a leisurely
``shark-viewing'' pace.
</P>
<P>
   The resort will have a total of more than 30 restaurants, bars
and lounges; two casinos; convention facilities; new swimming
pools; more aquariums; and a yacht marina.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Towers is as spectacular as the temple. The Great Hall
of Waters lobby has a 70-foot ceiling and water cascading down
walls. All guest rooms will have balconies, and suites will feature
whirlpool tubs and his and hers bidets.
</P>
<P>
   Have a special occasion and need lots of room? You might
consider the 2,500-square-foot Imperial Suite, which will have an
800-square-foot balcony, private elevator and two bedrooms. Prices
haven't been set.
</P>
<P>
   New bars include the Atlas Bar &AMP; Grill, a sports bar, and the
elegant Five Twins, which will have a cigar lounge and dance floor.
A seafood bar will have views of The Dig, an underwater series of
passageways inhabited by sharks, rays, and piranhas.
</P>
<P>
   CAPTION: STEPHANIE WELSH/Staff Photographer
</P>
<P>
   The 1,200-room Royal Towers, opening Dec. 22, is the centerpiece
of the huge Atlantis resort on Paradise Island. The Imperial Suite
takes up the entire bridge in the middle of the structure.

 &HT;    Trainer promotes one week to a leaner you for a fat 10,000
 &HT;    By Carolyn Susman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oprah doesn't want him, and he's tried like heck to get her.
</P>
<P>
   He waves at her while she's running; he tries to get her
attention in the elevator of her apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   But Jim Karas still isn't deterred.
</P>
<P>
   ``We send her press kits; we send her letters,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Oprah Winfrey would be a nice jewel in Karas' crown, but the
Chicago-based fitness trainer is doing fine without her.
</P>
<P>
   Karas offers a one-week intense fitness makeover to anyone who
can produce $10,000 for the effort. That's 10 times $1,000. No
small change.
</P>
<P>
   And, guess what?
</P>
<P>
   He says seven people have signed on _ one for two weeks_ since
he started the service in April.
</P>
<P>
   The key, Karas says, is worming his way into his clients' lives.
And being so effective that they're motivated to change their
lifestyles and eating habits.
</P>
<P>
   Ten thousand dollars is good motivation for starters.
</P>
<P>
   But Karas, who has been a fitness trainer for 12 years, pushes
flabby CEOs and overweight entrepreneurs until even they wish he
would stop.
</P>
<P>
   And he includes all those who circulate around them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spend time with anyone who comes in contact with them on a
regular basis,'' he says. ``You can't have your administrative
assistant ordering bagels and danish when you're supposed to be
eating fruit and yogurt.''
</P>
<P>
   But what does he do, exactly, for $10,000?
</P>
<P>
   ``I had dozens of people say if only you'd live with me, if only
you'd make me do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, he does.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's total immersion. I check the garbage. I follow them
around as much as they'll let me. I get into the cupboards. Then
for one year, I call them on a weekly basis and hold them
accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   In what way?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't put up with a lot. I say things like, `I know you were
out of town last week, what is the scale saying? Why aren't you
(scheduled) for another two workouts?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, Karas doesn't know how effective his training
will be longterm. And he won't give out names of his clients. But
he's confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know everyone is progressing well. They're now working with
personal trainers I interviewed for them. I fax their chefs
recipes. I really do keep on them.''
</P>
<P>
   He keeps on himself, too. The 6-foot, 137-pound former money
manager lifts weights four times a week, and keeps ``a running
tally in my head of what I'm eating.''
</P>
<P>
   He never fails to weigh himself daily and leaves room for the
glass a day of wine he loves.
</P>
<P>
   And he happily takes cash for his services. Five of his
exclusive clients paid by check, Karas says.
</P>
<P>
   But sorry. No American Express.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do deal well with a very intelligent person who wants
to make a change,'' Karas stresses. ``We don't call this the
Berlitz course for the body for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   TEN TIPS FROM THE $10,000 TRAINER
</P>
<P>
   _ Only use a balanced beam scale, similar to the one in your
doctor's office. Others aren't as accurate.
</P>
<P>
   _ If it shines, don't eat it. Shine means oil, which means fat.
Olive oil is 100 percent fat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stop eating pasta in restaurants. The noodle itself is high in
calories and most restaurants coat the pasta in butter, margarine,
or oil to keep it from sticking.
</P>
<P>
   _ When at a buffet, select the smallest plate and try not to
talk near the buffet table. Move away, so you're not tempted to
reach for additional portions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eat 100 fewer calories a day for 35 days, and you'll lose one
pound.
</P>
<P>
   _ Buy a heart rate monitor. It's the single most important
indicator of how your heart is responding to exercise.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never think, `I exercise, so I can eat whatever I want.' Most
people overestimate the amount of calories they burn during
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   _ Include strength and resistance exercises in your workout
routine. After the age of 20, the average person loses one-half
pound of muscle per year. And muscle is the most metabolically
active tissue.
</P>
<P>
   _ Small people beware. You can't eat as much as bigger and
taller people.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stop thinking you have a bad metabolism. ``I have yet to come
across a client with a bad metabolism, just bad . . . habits.''

 &HT;    Aggies spinning their wheels in an offensive rut
 &HT;    By Randy Riggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ ``We're not doing as bad as y'all think
we are,'' Dante Hall told the pen-toting inquisitors surrounding
him. ``We're not horrible. It looks like it, but we're not.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas A&AMP;M running back was correct on one count, at least:
It does, indeed, look like it.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies' offense has spent its first three games going
nowhere fast. In the NCAA Division I-A weekly statistics, A&AMP;M ranks
108th out of 112 teams in total offense with an average of 217.67
yards per game, s, like the weather we've played in the past two
games. You can't write everything off just on the condition of the
fields, but that is one of the factors.''Indeed, the Aggies cite a
myriad of reasons for their problems, but the little things have
added up to this bottom line: A&AMP;M is averaging only 111 rushing
yards per game (lowest since been playing to put up a lot of points
or yards. My primary concern is walking off the field with A&AMP;M
having more points than the other team.''

 &HT;    Getting to know Noni
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLINGTON, Fla. _ You know all about Beanie Babies and Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Are you ready for Grandma Noni?
</P>
<P>
   She's huggable. She's lovable. She's warm and snuggly, the way a
granny should be.
</P>
<P>
   And Olga Kraft is hoping Grandma Noni will be the next craze on
TV and at the toy store.
</P>
<P>
   Think Power Rangers and Ninja Turtles, only without the
crime-fighting gig.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft, a Realtor who lives in Wellington, created the first
Grandma Noni doll about three years ago, modeling the plush doll _
hair in a bun, fringed kerchief draped around her neck _ after her
Hungarian grandmother, Nana. She and veteran television producers
Jack Olesker and Robert Billian are now in the beginning stages of
creating an animated series based on the doll.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes as planned, the multicultural granny could be in
stores and on the tube around the world by this time next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Grandma Noni TV show will feature children and families from
around the world sharing their storytelling adventures. The goal is
to help children learn more about their personal history and absorb
some ``family values'' as well, Kraft said.
</P>
<P>
   It's an idea that came from the heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 2 1/2 when my mother died, so I was raised by my
grandmother,'' said Kraft, who would not reveal her age. ``She
taught me about my mother and my family's history by telling me
stories, so I created a doll that could be used for storytelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft's daughter, Jeannie, helped her design the doll about
three years ago. They followed up with a trip to Taipei, Taiwan,
two years ago to work out production details and began marketing
the doll at toy shows during last year's holiday season. The doll
is not yet available in stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a little like giving birth,'' Kraft said with a
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft was introduced to Olesker and Billian by mutual friends
and told them of her idea for a doll that could be marketed around
the world. Everyone has a grandmother, she reasoned, so the doll
could be adapted in any country by using stories from every
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Olesker and Billian, who created BOCA Entertainment in 1995 in
west Boca after decades of individual work in Los Angeles, were
impressed by the character's versatility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my earliest memories are of my mom taking me to the
public library in Chicago and getting me a library card,'' Olesker
said. ``Unfortunately, it's difficult for parents to do that sort
of thing these days. I think that Grandma Noni fills a void in
storytelling that kids my age grew up with.''
</P>
<P>
   Olesker and Billian know a little about storytelling. Between
the two, their resume looks like a greatest hits list of children's
entertainment for the past 15 years, including The New Adventures
of He-Man, Care Bears, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Mighty Morphin
Power Rangers and the well-regarded Kids Have Rights, Too!, which
won an award for Best Children's Video from the American Film
Institute in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   One reason they think Grandma Noni will be a success is because
the market for children's programming is changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a big backlash against violence and laser bang-bang
shows today,'' Olesker said. ``The pendulum is swinging the other
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Olesker and Billian's company is assembling a presentation
package for programmers that includes a 40- to 50-page series
``bible'' that explains the show's proposed format, each
character's descriptions, details of a pilot episode along with
enough material to do 13 or 26 episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for initial production to be done at Nite Lite
Studios in Pompano Beach, with actual animation completed at larger
studios in Taipei and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Once it's ready to be pitched to TV executives, the concept will
compete with dozens of other programs aimed at children, but the
team is confident that Grandma Noni's charm and the Olesker and
Billian's track record will bring success. After the TV show begins
airing, the doll will start appearing on toy shelves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in business to develop a program and see where it's
going to go,'' Olesker said. ``Our business is to see a project
make it on the air.''

   It's the computer equivalent of a vaccine. Companies are hiring
hackers to break into their computer systems to expose weaknesses.
Does it work? The October issue of Internet Business examines this
practice and the problem of corporate computer security. This issue
is examined through the career of Brad Powell, better known as
``Shooter'' among his fellow hackers. Shooter is one of the good
guys. He works for Sun Microsystems' security division and has
hacked into more than 700,000 systems in the past 10 years. He's
entered some of these systems in less than six seconds. His message
to the companies he has hacked into: Never let your guard down or
get comfortable thinking your system is impenetrable.

<P>
   IBM has released the latest edition of its electronic
encyclopedia, 1999 World Book Deluxe Edition. It has added a number
of new features. They include Cyber Safari, a collection of video
clips from the San Diego Zoo. Another new feature is Quiz Wizard,
an organizational tool that helps students prepare for tests. The
Wizard creates flashcards, and helps students draft questions and
research correct answers. And there's a feature called Web Page
Wizard that lets users make newsletter-style Web pages. It uses
templates and lets people embed links in the pages from the World
Book encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular program that has been recently upgraded is Rand
McNally's TripMaker Deluxe. New features include preplanned trips
that include driving instructions and recommendations for lodging
and restaurants. TripMaker now also lets you search for specific
restaurants, hotels and hospitals, among other things, at various
highway exits. And the program now supports the PalmPilot, the
hand-held computer from 3Com.

 &HT;    Seismic device warns of tornadoes
 &HT;    By John Ghirardini
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The South is all too familiar with the devastation tornadoes can
wreak. Parts of metro Atlanta and Hall County were battered earlier
this year by twisters _ the most powerful and violent atmospheric
storms the planet produces _ that caused 14 deaths and $163 million
in damage.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing can prevent nature's fury, but an early-warning device
in the running for a $100,000 Innovation in Communication prize can
help those in a tornado's path get to relative safety before the
proverbial freight train thunders overhead.
</P>
<P>
   The Seismic Tornado Detector System ``feels'' a twister after it
hits the ground. The device can detect seismic signals from the
storm from between 8 and 17 miles away. A network version has been
designed already, and an in-home version similar to a smoke alarm
will provide a warning time of two to four minutes _ enough for
residents to reach the safest part of the house.
</P>
<P>
   The STD is vying with 10 other ``world-changing ideas'' in the
inaugural award competition, sponsored by global communications
giant Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi. A yearlong search garnered entries from 27
countries and resulted in 11 finalists being picked. Some of the
entries were prototypes, some were practical applications and some
were available devices.
</P>
<P>
   The judges include Apollo 11 moon-walking astronaut Buzz Aldrin
and novelist William Gibson, whose influential 1984 novel
``Neuromancer'' coined the term ``cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other finalists are a hand-held translating pen, a
vision aid for the blind that lets them ``see'' with sound waves,
much like a bat does, and a ``critical mass communicator'' designed
to bring communications to those who have no phones and are not
literate.
</P>
<P>
   The prize will be awarded Oct. 30 at the State of the World
Forum in San Francisco. Those with access to the Internet can find
detailed explanations and animated demonstrations of all the
finalists at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .saatchi-saatchi.com.

<P>
   New phone flips out
</P>
<P>
   Nextel has a little something to say about wireless
communications.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia-based company is offering a new pocket-sized
digital phone that packs a raft of features into a package only 4.5
inches long, 2.2 inches wide and 1.2 inches deep.
</P>
<P>
   The new i1000, manufactured for Nextel by Motorola, also sports
a see-through flip cover that lets the user access several
functions and initiate or receive calls without opening the cover.
</P>
<P>
   The device offers a speakerphone for hands-free operation,
Caller ID, vibration alert, three-way calling for conference calls,
an additional line and nine selectable ring styles.
</P>
<P>
   Other standard features are Nextel's Direct Connect two-way
radio function, digital cellular, voice mail, and text and numeric
paging.
</P>
<P>
   The i1000 comes with a standard lithium ion battery, giving the
phone a weight of just 5.78 ounces. If that's still too heavy, a
slimmed-down battery is available that lowers the weight to 5.4
ounces. With either battery the phone will work for 180 minutes of
talk time or 50 hours of standby time.
</P>
<P>
   The i1000 has a regular retail price of $399, but will sell
initially for a special promotional price of $299.
</P>
<P>
   On the home front
</P>
<P>
   Do-it-yourselfers with computer connections have had their own
home and garden consultant since 1991, when HouseNet had its
beginnings as an electronic bulletin board.
</P>
<P>
   HouseNet since has graduated to the World Wide Web and AOL, and
offers tips or calculators on everything from how many gallons of
paint it will take to cover a wall to managing a household budget.
The free site now receives more than 400,000 visits each month.
</P>
<P>
   The site has just added a Smart Savings content area that
created a virtual neighborhood in which visitors can swap
cost-cutting tips and offer advice over HouseNet's bulletin boards
and chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   HouseNet also has content areas on home improvement, home
decorating, lawn and garden, and online shopping. The areas are
continually updated with the latest information.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd rather pay someone else to do the work, HouseNet offers
information from ImproveNet, a Web-based service that keeps and
updates the legal, license, credit and job performance histories of
virtually every one of the nearly 600,000 contractors in the
nation.

 &HT;    Communicate Pro capable, but complex
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is very little to be done with a telephone that
Communicate Pro, a software package from 01 Communique Laboratory,
isn't prepared to do. All the user has to do is figure out how to
make it work.
</P>
<P>
   Communicate Pro takes me back to the days of the 300 baud modem
and the first communication software programs, so arcane that even
the people selling the stuff often couldn't figure it out.
</P>
<P>
   Communicate Pro is intended to handle e-mail and Web browsing,
standard modem-to-modem telecommunication, fax, contact management
and very complex voice-mail routing. It will, for instance, dial up
your Internet service provider, download mail, and then either dial
your pager to tell you you've got mail, or forward it to some other
address. Optical character recognition is built in for converting
incoming faxes to text documents.
</P>
<P>
   The program comes with a 200-page manual, and you're going to
need it. I tried, for instance, to set it up to check my e-mail.
After a certain amount of floundering around with the manual and
the program, and overcoming a few obstacles by sheer coincidence, I
managed to get it to accept the information _ such as I had _ for
my account.
</P>
<P>
   But I could find nowhere to tell it what number to dial or what
password to use. Finally, for no particular reason, I decided to
enter the number of my ISP as a speed dial number. When I did that,
lo and behold, up comes a dialog box asking for a user name and
password.
</P>
<P>
   So I got connected. I couldn't get my e-mail, but that's because
I didn't have complete information to give the program.
</P>
<P>
   Communicate Pro runs off a control panel that is totally
non-intuitive. Upon booting, it detects the modem automatically,
then seizes the phone line to which it is connected. No ``Would you
like ...'' or ``Do you mind''; it just grabs it. That annoys me,
but without doing that, many of the program's features, especially
answering machine functions and voice-mail routing, aren't going to
work.
</P>
<P>
   If you need all these things on your modem, well ... there it
is. I have not tried another program so powerful.
</P>
<P>
   However, before forking over $190 for the program, you can go to
http://www.01com.com and download a free 15-day trial copy of the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Other programs of interest
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to add or replace a hard drive and are
fearful of the operation, there's a program called Drive UP. It
won't make the physical installation, but handles the
configuration.
</P>
<P>
   I've never found this to be particularly difficult, but then
I've never had to replace my main hard drive. I've added several.
Whatever the case, Drive UP will make the entire operation
painless, including whatever kind of partitioning you want to use.
It's made by FWB, and I suspect a lot of you would find its $25
price tag well worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, for those who make heavy use of removable disks such as
Zip or Jaz or even just plain floppies, there is DiskCataloger from
Sheridan Software. Once you tell DiskCataloger to register a
removable disk of any kind, even CD-ROM, it will track that disk
every time you put it into the computer. When you need to find a
file stored on one of your many disks, you simply search the
program for it the same way you'd search for a file on the hard
drive. Its $35 price tag is reasonable, and you can download one of
those 15-day free trials from http://www.diskcataloger.com/

 &HT;    Nassau moves to a soundtrack
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASSAU, Bahamas -- Rap boomed on the radio of a public jitney,
and the driver sang along as he drove, his shoulders and head
bouncing to the beat.
</P>
<P>
   A T-shirt saleswoman on Bay Street hummed as she rang up a sale.
And a young basket-weaver at the Straw Market softly sang Mariah
Carey's ``Butterfly'' as her fingers knotted palmetto fronds.
</P>
<P>
   This colonial port city moves to a soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   I always listen to the rhythms of the island, and in one weekend
I heard Junkanoo, reggae, rap, rock and sexy soca.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday morning, hymns sung by the choirs and congregations of
a dozen hillside churches drifted over the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   And in the afternoon, a funeral procession passed through town,
mourners waving their arms and singing,
</P>
<P>
   ``When we all get to heaven,
</P>
<P>
   What a day of rejoicing that will be,
</P>
<P>
   When we all get to heaven,
</P>
<P>
   We will sing and shout the victory.''
</P>
<P>
   The singing, with a backup of drums and brass, was so powerful
it reminded us to find joy in the moment; and in an urgent beat
that went straight to the heart, it made us believe that there
could be victory after death.
</P>
<P>
   Friday after the sun set, and after the thousands of cruise ship
passengers had gone back to their ships, I set out with Julio
Brathwaite, a video-maker and concert promoter who was born and
raised in Nassau, to find music. There were too many choices -- the
soft soca of Ezra and the Polka Dots at the Polka Dot Lounge on
Paradise Island, the lavish Las Vegas-style Sunsational at Atlantis
resort, or a quiet club in the country.
</P>
<P>
   First stop was none of the above. We drove 8 miles west of
Nassau to Cable Beach and the huge Radisson Cable Beach Resort. We
were in search of real Bahamian Junkanoo, the music of slaves from
Ghana's Gold Coast who came to the Bahamas to work the plantations
in the 17th and 18th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``Junkanoo'' came from the West African name of Jananin
Canno, a combination of the Quojas tribe's Canno, a supreme being
who controlled their lives, and Janani, the spirits who were seen
as defenders of the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   A West African dance, two steps forward and one step back, is
still a part of the Junkanoo experience.
</P>
<P>
   We heard Barrabbas and the Tribe before we saw them - cow bells,
goat-skin drums, whistles, trumpets and trombones. In 6-foot-high
feathered headdresses and costumes in brilliant colors, they filed
past the limos and the tour vans in front of the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribe had another gig down the road, and we watched them
dancing down the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you go to Nassau in the wee hours of Dec. 26 or New
Year's Day to see the Junkanoo parade, the Tribe's weekend
performances at Nassau's hotels are your best opportunity to see
the costumes, dancers and musicians.
</P>
<P>
   At the Junkanoo Jamboree dinner show at the Radisson, we got a
taste of traditional Bahamian food including stewed conch, johnny
cakes and guava duffs (an exquisite pastry of guava and brandy),
and saw limbo dancing done by Jooky, a white-haired Bahamian man in
his 60s who could squeeze under a bar just inches off the ground,
and a Bahamian band.
</P>
<P>
   We were lucky and got to see the Bahamen, the Bahamas' most
famous band, at their club, Club 601. Check with the tourist board
at Rawson Square near the cruise ship docks to see if they are
playing while you're in town.
</P>
<P>
   At most Nassau clubs, the dress is strictly uptown. At Club 601
men in white double-breasted suits and ladies in elegant,
skin-tight, dresses danced like Fred and Ginger, if Fred and Ginger
had ever gotten down and dirty to Junkanoo and reggae.
</P>
<P>
   You don't dance in Nassau if you're shy -- only the tourists are
jumping around with five feet of space between their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody else is pressed close, pelvises synchronized to the
sensual beat of the goat-skin drums and the wail of the Bahamen's
guitars. Legs are entangled, and mouths are close enough to kiss. A
lot of the dancers sing along -- the Bahamen have four CDs and
Bahamians know all the songs.
</P>
<P>
   We met up with the band after their first set. Their music is
inspired by Africa and Junkanoo, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We face the challenge of keeping it alive,'' said singer
Nehemiah Heild, who looked like Dennis Rodman with his bleached
blond hair. ``Bahamian music is not rap or reggae. But it has an
excitement and energy.''
</P>
<P>
   And, adds guitarist Herschel Small, ``The lyrics are positive
and clean.''
</P>
<P>
   At most Nassau clubs the dress code is ``Come dressed and
pressed.'' At The Zoo disco club, which is packed on weekend
nights, the rule is ``Dress to impress.'' The club, on West Bay
Street between Nassau and Cable Beach, is packed most nights with
tourists and Bahamians.
</P>
<P>
   We drove back to Nassau, stopping at the Culture Club, owned by
Nassau's most famous disc jockey, Terrible T. It was breathing-room
only, bodies moving in mass as DJs played rap.
</P>
<P>
   The music was too loud to talk, which was the point. Who has
anything important to say on a Friday night? At this place, you're
immersed in music, and forced by the drum beat to move your hips to
the rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where the average working Bahamian goes to work off
stress,'' said Brathwaite. There were few tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night started with dinner at the island's most famous
music landmark, Compass Point, a flamboyant celebrity hotel and
restaurant owned by Island Records CEO Chris Blackwell. It's about
a dozen miles west of Nassau.
</P>
<P>
   Compass Point studio, where Bob Marley, the Rolling Stones, Bon
Jovi, Al Green, Phil Collins and Jimmy Buffett among many others
have recorded, is across the street.
</P>
<P>
   The music on the sound system -- Manu Dibango and Dexter Gordon
-- and the food in the outdoor restaurant were reason enough for
the long drive. And you never know who you might see -- Lenny
Kravitz or Cindy Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   On the way back to Nassau, we stopped by the Fish Fry on Arawak
Cay, a collection of about 45 booths offering cracked conch, fried
snapper, grilled lobster, dolphin, grouper and plenty of Kaliks,
the national beer (pronounced Kah-LICK, the sound made by the cow
bells of Junkanoo). Goldie's had a live band in the back. At
Eddie's, a guy chopped conch for conch salad while a live broadcast
from the Culture Club blared from huge speakers.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 p.m. it was time to go to the Queen Elizabeth Sports
Center to see the reggae concert. More than 4,000 people stood
within the perimeters formed by 14 truck trailers. It started to
rain, but no one seemed to care as the Kaliks flowed and the DJs
played music on stage. And finally, Jamusa, a DJ from WAVS in
Miami, introduced The Blaze Band from Jamaica, who had finally
arrived on a jitney.
</P>
<P>
   And Sunday afternoon we were reminded of the power of music in
rejoicing in life, and in death. The funeral for Askari Gibson, a
teenager killed by a car when he crossed a downtown street, wound
through the streets of Nassau in the late afternoon. The drums,
brass and cymbals of the C.R. Walker High School Band could be
heard across the city.
</P>
<P>
   The procession of relatives and friends who proceeded the hearse
sang hymns and danced to the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funerals are supposed to be joyous occasions, not solemn,''
said Brathwaite.
</P>
<P>
   The exhuberant music, played by teenagers wearing their school
plaids, made that very clear.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   To find out if the Bahamen are playing in Nassau, stop by the
Bahamas Tourist Office at Rawson Square near the cruise ship docks.

through 45 years.
</P>
<P>
   Michael speaks of his daily struggle against temptation and
relapse. He implores all to surrender to a higher power. The men
pray.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is hope,'' he says. ``There is a way out, and I have
found it.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael and his group aren't trying to rid themselves of alcohol
or drug abuse. They seek to eliminate a behavior they believe is
just as destructive: homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The word behavior is essential to this meeting of the Worth
Creations ministry. Its followers think homosexuality is a behavior
rather than an orientation decided at birth. Their message is stop
having gay sex, and you stop being gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest misconception about us is that we are in denial,''
said Richard Culbertson, the group's director. ``If this is denial,
then that's fine with me because it works, and I'm happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Culbertson, 59, said he rejected the gay lifestyle he was living
20 years ago and has been celibate since. In 1985, he formed Worthy
Creations and affiliated it with Exodus International, which for 25
years has served as the umbrella organization for scores of
ministries whose stated purpose is to turn gays straight.
</P>
<P>
   Gay activists argue that there is neither need nor justification
for turning people away from what they are and that the Exodus
movement is intolerant and homophobic.
</P>
<P>
   ``What these folks operate on is that there's something wrong
with being the person you are,'' said Rebecca Isaacs of the
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in Washington, D.C. ``For them,
it's not about freedom of choice but repression and brainwashing.
We would never condemn an individual who wants to be who they are.
Why do they?''
</P>
<P>
   Culbertson insists that he does not recruit clients from the gay
community. He says Worthy Creations exists only as an option for
those who want to change and offers them a bridge to return to the
traditional church.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gay community has a lot of legitimate gripes against the
church,'' he said. ``For years, churches have said they've hated
the sin but loved the sinner. Yet they've also said we don't want
them in our churches. Because of Exodus, these people have been
able to find a way back to Christianity.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the sexual conversion movement was invigorated by a
national advertising campaign sponsored by the Center for
Reclaiming America, a conservative Christian ministry founded in
Fort Lauderdale by D. James Kennedy. Culbertson has his office in
the Federal Highway building operated by Kennedy's Coral Ridge
Presbyterian Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most exciting time for us I can remember,''
Culbertson said. ``Up until now, we've been the best-kept secret in
South Florida. But with Reclaiming America's help, we're getting
our message out and letting people know that there is hope for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of a ``truth in love'' campaign, the Center for
Reclaiming America spent more than $200,000 for full-page ads in
USA Today, the New York Times and the Washington Post. It is the
beginning of a media blitz that is aimed at the fall elections and
has the financial and spiritual blessings of groups such as the
Christian Coalition, Concerned Women for America, the Family
Research Council and the American Family Association.
</P>
<P>
   The ad campaign grew from criticism leveled at pro football
player Reggie White and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott over
recent statements on homosexuality. Lott likened it to an
addiction; the Green Bay Packers' White referred to it as ``one of
the biggest sins in the Bible'' in a speech to the Wisconsin
legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Reclaiming America said it has launched its
counteroffensive in the interest of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let anyone tell you it isn't a homophobic campaign,''
Isaacs said. ``The right saw this as a really good issue to take
into the November elections. They always have to have one major
enemy, one scapegoat. Communism is dead. How about gay people?''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa McWhorter, executive director of Compass Inc., Palm Beach
County's gay services organization, takes issue with the Exodus
call for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal opinion is that there's nothing to convert people
to or from,'' McWhorter said. ``But if it's a religious belief,
everyone in this country has a right to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists and medical professionals also have voiced opposition
to the Exodus approach. The nation's largest society of
psychologists last year passed a resolution aimed at discrediting
therapeutic practices that attempt to change sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The American Psychological Association, by a vote of 106-4,
renounced conversion therapy and endorsed the American Psychiatric
Association position that homosexuality is not a mental illness
that needs fixing. Both groups say conversion attempts are
ineffective and can be harmful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The science may be inconclusive,'' Culbertson said. ``But if
you're able to change your lifestyle, then that change is
conclusive for you. For me, this is conclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   Culbertson says he has no statistical evidence on how successful
Worthy Creations has been through its 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the scientific resources to keep tabs on
people,'' he said. ``But I know of dozens of people who have
changed their lifestyle. Some have gotten married, had children and
raised families.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-five percent of the people who come to Worthy Creations
meetings are male. Groups meet in Miami Beach, Fort Lauderdale and
in West Palm Beach at the Lighthouse Christian Center. Those who
attend quote scripture and offer personal testimonies much like a
12-step program. Exodus claims to have counseled 200,000 nationally
since 1976; Culbertson says about 500 people participate in his
ministry each year and that he has reached ``several thousand'' in
its 14-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that women have a much harder time getting out because
of the emotional bonds they form,'' Culbertson said. ``The reason
most people fail is because of a lack of resolve. It is like an
alcoholic in some respects. You get to a point where you want to
change, but you go out and fall again.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond treating homosexuality as a psychological disorder,
conversion ministries also regard it as a moral transgression, a
sin: ``We base our presentation on the Bible, which states clearly
that homosexual behavior is not in God's plan for men and women,''
Exodus states in published literature. ``We're not condemning
anyone. At the same time, it isn't unloving to talk about sin.''
</P>
<P>
   Professing a different theological view is the Universal
Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches, a California-based
Christian ministry that embraces gay, bisexual and trans-gender
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scripture Exodus always quotes is from the Old
Testament,'' said Frank Zerilli of Metropolitan's world center in
West Hollywood, Calif. ``Well, you can find people in the Old
Testament condemned for eating shrimp or condemned for eating
oysters or condemned for wearing different color clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key thing is that Jesus said absolutely nothing on the
subject of sexual orientation. If it is so important to salvation,
why didn't he say something about it? He didn't because it doesn't
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   About 300 congregations in 19 countries have Metropolitan
Community affiliation, including churches in West Palm Beach,
Delray Beach and Boca Raton. The church was founded in 1968 and has
grown steadily, drawing followers who felt ostracized by more
conservative ministries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the church owes the gay community an apology,''
Culbertson said. ``The church has not reached out to them the way
it should have. They are the un-harvested harvest.''
</P>
<P>
   Earl, who asks that his surname be withheld, is a 40-year-old
construction contractor from Lake Worth. He is married with three
children and says he has engaged in homosexual sex before and
during his marriage. For the last six weeks, he has been attending
Worthy Creations meetings in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in the church understood or was willing to help me
until I found this group,'' Earl said. ``When I went to my pastor
and told him about my homosexual tendencies, he told me to go out
and have sex with a female prostitute. This way is much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael says he went through a decade of emotional turmoil after
he and his wife divorced in the late '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had always had homosexual tendencies and urges, but I fell
into the gay lifestyle totally after my divorce,'' he said. ``I did
all the bath houses. I abused alcohol. I nearly overdosed on drugs.
I lost my job. I just wasn't happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sober for 14 years, Michael, a hyperactive man who puts Jesus in
most paragraphs, says he has found a serenity he never had until he
joined Worthy Creations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only true fulfillment is in a relationship with Jesus
Christ,'' he said. ``My friends in the gay community think I'm a
turncoat. But this is what I want and what I need. I have never met
a homosexual who was really happy _ really happy in his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael says he still has occasional twinges of attraction
toward men but that those have diminished through the years. He
said he has made two attempts to have relationships with women, but
those quickly failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exodus is not for everybody,'' he said. ``You have to want to
change. Once you do, you learn that you can have something that's
much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael said he is celibate and hopes to remain so.

 &HT;    Homework _ it's the kid's job, not yours
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   My second-grader is talking to the head on his pencil.
</P>
<P>
   He's supposed to be doing his spelling words. Write each one
five times, the teacher said. But there he is, I can see him plain
as day from my secret perch behind the dining room wall.
</P>
<P>
   He is having a full-fledged conversation with the orange nub at
the end of his No. 2 _ the one he uses to do his 3s over when he
writes them backward on his math papers.
</P>
<P>
   I go back to my bedroom, open my book, dial my husband and tell
him in my best neurotic mother voice, which is actually just my
regular everyday voice, that I think we have a real problem on our
hands. Mainly, our son is a failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's ever going to be student of the year,'' I
say. ``It takes him so long to do his homework.''
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought that homework could ruin dinner, create a
fight between husband and wife and bring a child to tears? Who
would have thought that homework could be such a hassle?
</P>
<P>
   Kids whine. ``This is too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Kids procrastinate. ``I'll do it after I play on the computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Kids lie. ``I did it at after-care.''
</P>
<P>
   Kids cry. ``I hate school. I hate you. I hate math.''
</P>
<P>
   And parents wring their hands.
</P>
<P>
   They bribe and cajole and remind and assist and smile and pat
backs and bribe some more. They deliver snacks and help find
pencils and bring new pieces of paper when the old ones get
crumpled up in a fit of frustration.
</P>
<P>
   But not me. Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   We are turning over a new leaf in our house. A new homework
leaf. So if you see a handsome but bemused second-grader wandering
around out there, he just might be mine.
</P>
<P>
   And whatever you do, don't remind him to do his spelling words.
</P>
<P>
   His homework is his responsibility, John Rosemond says.
</P>
<P>
   I talked to Rosemond the other day about homework, and let me
tell you, he scared me.
</P>
<P>
   Rosemond is a syndicated parenting columnist and a family
psychologist who has written a book on homework. It's called Ending
the Homework Hassle ($8.95, Andrews and McMeel). You could say that
Rosemond and I are like oil and water when it comes to parenting
techniques. I mean, I could tell right off the bat that this guy
has things like rules in his house. In fact, just talking to him on
the telephone made me sit up straight in my chair. And I'm 42!
</P>
<P>
   But I'm giving his homework advice a try.
</P>
<P>
   Give him one hour to do his homework, Rosemond tells me.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that sounds totally unfair to me. What if he doesn't
finish? What if he has a lot? What if? What if? What if?
</P>
<P>
   Then he has to face the consequences, Rosemond says.
</P>
<P>
   Consequences, I say. That sounds serious, at which point
Rosemond realizes what he's got on his hands.
</P>
<P>
   I am a homework enabler.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the word I use,'' he says. ``Enabler.''
</P>
<P>
   I ask my 7-year-old if he's got homework. Then I tell him to sit
down and do it. Then I tell him he's made his 3 backward. Then I
tell him, ``Good job.'' Then I tell him, in my sweetest voice,
``Hurry up, honey, so you can go play.'' Then I tell him to hurry
up again. Then I remind him to put it in his backpack. Then, in the
morning, I set his backpack on the chair right next to his
lunchbox. Then when he forgets it, I run it over to school.
</P>
<P>
   Rosemond, you see, thinks parents (like me) are too easy-going,
too helpful, when it comes to homework. He takes me back to my
childhood. Now, I'm not sure how he knows this stuff, but I'm not
arguing with Mr. Rosemond.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just came home and did your homework,'' Rosemond tells me.
``You didn't expect a lot of help from your mother. And you knew
that there were consequences at school if you didn't get your
homework done. And if there were consequences at school, there were
usually consequences at home. But today, there are no
consequences,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Here are Rosemond's ABCs of homework:
</P>
<P>
   _ All by himself:
</P>
<P>
   ``The child does his homework in a private, personal place,
preferably at a desk in his room, rather than in a public, family
place such as the kitchen table. This arrangement not only helps
define homework as the child's responsibility, but also helps
parents resist the urge to hover.
</P>
<P>
   _ Back off:
</P>
<P>
   ``This means you do not ask any questions like, `Do you need any
help with your homework?' or, `How can you do your homework with
that music playing?' or even, `Do you have any homework tonight?'
Furthermore, you don't do unnecessary things like checking to make
sure the child is really doing his homework. And you don't rush to
the child's rescue if you hear him pounding his desk in
frustration. This is not to say that you should never help . . .
but only if the child asks.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Call it quits at a reasonable hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Set an upper time limit on homework. In most instances, the
child should be responsible for deciding when to begin, but parents
should decide when to call `time.' The deadline should be
consistent, say 8 o'clock every night. Setting an upper limit (If
it's not done in an hour, it doesn't get done.) teaches time
management.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosemond concedes that his rules are rough, but he also claims
they work. Children, he says, need to be responsible for their own
homework, and we have to teach them how to be responsible. Rosemond
says that young children should be eased into this routine. And
once the rules are established, stick to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The child who knows that Mom feels like homework is her
responsibility is a child who is that much less likely to do his
work in class,'' Rosemond said. ``What gives us the impression that
children are incapable of doing their own work?''
</P>
<P>
   And I don't know about you, but I'm sitting up a lot straighter
than I was a couple of weeks ago.

 &HT;    Storm aftermath leaves stories behind
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Keys have long been a place where good storytelling is
considered an art form.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of Hurricane Georges' visit, there is plenty
for islanders to tell.
</P>
<P>
   Some claimed that coconuts flew like cannonballs in 115-mph
winds. Angry motorists on U.S. 1 complained of nightmare traffic
jams and heartless police. Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay inspected Key West
and said the streets ``looked like the canals in Venice.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Keys, people wondered aloud when life might
return to normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on how you define normal,'' said Cynthia Edwards,
spokeswoman for Key West's emergency managers. ``In Key West,
that's a little hard to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Perplexing, too, was the lack of casualties rescue workers
continued to confirm.
</P>
<P>
   After killing hundreds in the Caribbean, Georges took no lives
in Florida and caused only minor injuries. Now the worries are
passed to the Louisiana bayou, where the deadly and determined
storm is moving on a path toward New Orleans with winds of more
than 100 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Police lifted their roadblock on U.S. 1 in Florida City at 10
a.m. on Sept. 27 and allowed residents of the Upper Keys to return
home for the first time since the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Only those carrying badges or credentials identifying them as
part of the emergency relief effort were allowed to pass. Many
waited for hours for the only entrance to the Keys to reopen. Many
fumed over the delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been so close to having riots here, it's
unbelievable,'' said one stranded motorist, Sharon Barrett, who
lives with her husband, Bruce, on a boat in Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   The Overseas Highway was open southbound only to mile marker 62
at Duck Key east of Marathon. Traffic backed up for 4 miles.
Officials did let through hundreds of cars before closing down the
whole stretch again at 6 p.m., said Greg Artman, spokesman for the
Monroe County Sheriff's Office. Reclosing the highway further
angered motorists who didn't make it through.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cops lie and intimidate you,'' complained Bill Fetters,
48, of Key Largo, who spent the night at the Florida City
roadblock. ``The next time there's a hurricane, I'm not leaving my
house. I'm not going to put up with this garbage again.''
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers doubled as cleanup crews while waiting for
emergency calls. Paramedics Cab Bentley, Nick Vassilakis and Needa
Paige, whose district covers Stock Island to Big Pine Key, pulled
tree limbs from roads as they drove their truck around Big Coppitt
Key.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had (calls for) lots of scratches and bumped heads,''
Bentley said.
</P>
<P>
   Tree after tree was uprooted on Big Coppitt. On the bay side,
James Woodley watched from his second-story porch as a giant banyan
toppled onto his neighbor's trailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it hit, it sounded like a train going through,'' he said.
``I don't think I'll sit through another.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the key, Tamarac Park, a development of
about 250 trailers that officials worried would suffer heavy
damages, was cluttered with awnings torn loose and toppled trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're lucky. The inside is just like I left it,'' said Paul
Hammond, who moved to the park when it opened 27 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Roofs were ripped from their beams on the Saddlebunch Keys,
where John Tomko felt his house vibrating and fled to a downstairs
room just minutes before his roof was peeled away. On the ocean
side of Cudjoe Key, Floyd Martin found a piece of roof near the
Overseas Highway when he drove up to his home. His house and
trailer sat in a pile, several yards from where they once stood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coconuts were like cannonballs blowing in the wind,'' said
Davin Kusik, who lives at the Venture Out mobile home park on
Cudjoe Key. Deputies said 60 percent of the 659 trailers there were
damaged or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Linda and Robert Barker and their two dogs have moved into their
shed, after most of their house washed into the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the (kitchen) cabinet floated over, they started
swimming, so I said we got to get the dogs,'' Robert Barker said.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife huddled on their kitchen counter as water rose
waist high. Their dogs curled up in cabinets above. The Barkers,
who moved to their house just a week ago from Corpus Christi,
Texas, lost most of their belongings, still packed in boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's corny and I'm not very religious, but I had a
Bible I put on the top shelf and it had family pictures,'' Linda
Barker said.
</P>
<P>
   Up and down the hardest-hit parts of the Keys, residents who
tried to ride out the storm at home emerged to find debris and
shredded houses. Those who fled returned to roads blocked by
uprooted trees and snapped utility poles.
</P>
<P>
   Shark Key, a small key of large, luxury homes built on stilts,
escaped with only a few blown roof tiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put a lot of poured concrete in houses in here,' said
Creighton Webb, who stayed in his house with his family, some
friends and two dogs. ``We were much more nervous before the storm
because once it starts, you get caught up in it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Lower Sugarloaf, the roof of one house was lifted up and
dropped in the street. Residents here said they never experienced
the eye, just constant storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to some neighbors and told them, `Your house survived
but your porch is gone,' ''' said Pam Baki, who stayed home for the
storm, wrapping rosary beads around her wrist.
</P>
<P>
   On Big Pine, Lauri Telcensky's house survived, but late Saturday
afternoon caught fire after she moved a generator from her deli on
Duck Key to power her refrigerator. The fire sent a cloud of black
smoke into the sky that alerted neighbors who called her. When
firefighters arrived, they found flames inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought my pig was burning. I didn't even care about the
house,'' she said, holding a rope tied around her pot-bellied pig,
Piggy.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the vegetation on the lower Keys was thrashed, and the
winds tore roofs and stripped siding from the walls of dozens of
homes. But the instances of major damage to homes and businesses
appeared few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people that understood to prepare for a hurricane came
through it real well,'' said Billy Wagner, emergency coordinator
for Monroe County.
</P>
<P>
   The damage appeared to be the same on Ramrod Key, Little Torch,
Summerland and Sugarloaf: windblown homes, felled trees, dangling
power lines, and the occasional ripped roof. Residents in these
areas were convinced that the winds topped 120 mph, though the
highest official clocking was 115 mph on Stock Island, just north
of Key West.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place got blistered,'' said Tim Galloway, who moved to
Ramrod Key from Hypoluxo. ``I don't care what they say. We got the
worst of it, for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   A shelter in Key West is housing more than 100 people, and
shelters also have been opened in Marathon and Big Pine Key. The
two main issues facing emergency officials today are the lack of
power and emergency services.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Power &AMP; Light spokesman Dale Thomas said FPL was sending
five two-man crews to help restore power. The Florida Keys Electric
Cooperative Association, which services the middle to upper keys,
reported that 10,000 of its 29,000 customers were still without
power Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Key West has partial electrical power, enough for the Winn-Dixie
supermarket, which will open today to allow people to buy supplies.
The supermarket also will give away water and ice.
</P>
<P>
   The power could be restored entirely in two or three days,
depending on whether electrical crews _ culled from several
different power companies _ can get to all the downed lines, Wagner
said.
</P>
<P>
   Crews from the state's Department of Transportation spent
Saturday clearing fallen tree branches and sand from the roadways.
No roads were washed away and the erosion was mostly minor, said
Steve Decker, the emergency operations manager for the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are power lines down everywhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On every island, there was evidence of resiliency. On Cudjoe
Key, a handful of locals rode out the storm in their trailers, four
of which were damaged beyond repair. Patrick Dean, a commercial
fisherman, had to shoo snakes from his trailer, and waded in
chest-high water to keep errant boats from slamming into his car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I own is gone,'' he said. ``My Harley Davidson
started to float away. I put my leathers on and sat right on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Clark watched the roof peel away from the bedroom of
her home on Ramrod Key. For two hours, she leaned her back into the
door of her bathroom _ the only room of her two-story house not
opened up by the storm. With her in the bathroom were her two
parrots and two dogs. Her iguana survived in the swirling bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's neighbors eventually waded into the storm surge to bring
her to safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took everything we had to get over here,'' said Eddie
Wenzel. ``If I had thought about it, we would have brought life
jackets. It was bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. MacKay, who toured the Keys by helicopter, said most of
the damage seemed to be in Big Pine Key and Marathon. The flooding
he saw in Key West was widespread.
</P>
<P>
   ``You drive down some of the streets and it looks like a canal
in Venice,'' MacKay said, and he lamented the damage at Houseboat
Row. ``It's just obliterated. That fact is kind of sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Additional National Guardsmen are expected to arrive this
morning to patrol the Overseas Highway, which officials plan to
open all the way to Key West this afternoon. Officials don't expect
an accurate estimate of the damage until homeowners return,
although insurance adjusters began arriving Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the storm continued its path Saturday through the
Gulf of Mexico, gathering strength as it once more headed toward
land. Hurricane warnings for Georges were posted along 330 miles of
coast from Panama City on the Panhandle to Morgan City, La. About 1
million people had been ordered or urged to leave the city and
low-lying coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
   Bumper-to-bumper traffic clogged Interstate 10 leaving New
Orleans. Motorists' tempers ran as hot as on Florida's U.S. 1.

 &HT;    'Practice' makes strongest case for riveting drama
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   . . . and the winner is . . . The Practice!
</P>
<P>
   With those words, ABC's gripping law series nabbed a
well-deserved best drama Emmy. The little show that could finally
took center stage after battling low ratings, dead-end time slots
and bone-headed network suits.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, everyone at the Emmys seemed shocked _ even the
top-notch cast. After all, David E. Kelley's arresting drama has
been on the air less than two years and was up against stiff
competition. ER. The X-Files. NYPD Blue. Law &AMP; Order. Great
company. Great shows. But none of them are better than The
Practice, which premieres today (10 p.m., WPBF-Channel 25,
WPLG-Channel 10).
</P>
<P>
   Since the show debuted in March 1997, The Practice has been the
most consistent drama on TV. Without question. In fact, it's not
even close. Each week, the episodes are compelling,
thought-provoking, poignant and gripping. After watching them, you
feel angry. Sad. Exhilarated. This is why TV was invented, folks.
It makes wading through all those stinker comedies and loser dramas
worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need a Ph.D. to figure out why The Practice is so
great. The answers start and end with creator/writer Kelley. This
TV author extraordinaire is no stranger to writing exceptional
drama. He did it on Picket Fences, repeated the trick on Chicago
Hope and he's still doing it on Ally McBeal.
</P>
<P>
   As a former lawyer and L.A. Law executive producer, Kelley is
able to look at two sides of a hot-button issue and provide
convincing arguments for each. And on The Practice, those topics
are always juicy ones. The show has tackled court orders to force
C-sections; possible cancer-causing power lines and murderers
facing lethal injections. It's like going to law class each week
without having to read dictionary-sized textbooks and taking
migrane-inducing exams.
</P>
<P>
   But, as is Kelley's style, he balances those heavyweight cases
with comical, light-hearted ones. ``Bighead'' Jimmy Berluti
(Michael Badalucco) defends a man who lost his job because he looks
like a monkey. Feisty Ellenor Frutt (Camryn Manheim) represents her
obnoxious cousin, who sues her travel agent for ruining her
honeymoon, and fiery Eugene Young (Steve Harris) argues the case of
a man who paid the IRS by using a pig as a check.
</P>
<P>
   The Practice is also blessed with a fine ensemble. While Dylan
McDermott, who plays handsome firm owner Bobby Donnell, gets
top-billing, he's often seen waiting in the wings while his
talented co-stars strut their stuff. And while Manheim deserved her
recent best supporting actress Emmy (listening to the heavyweight
Ellenor tell her boyfriend it's hard for her to take off her
clothes was one of the show's most touching moments), Harris
deserved one even more. I'm still trying to figure out who he
ticked off at the Academy not to even get nominated.
</P>
<P>
   Harris is one of those rare TV actors you can't take your eyes
off of when he's on screen. Whether he's delivering blistering
closing arguments or throwing low-life filth against the wall, he's
a commanding, Darth Vadar-like presence.
</P>
<P>
   So are many of the show's guest stars. John Larroquette also won
an Emmy for his brilliant role as a manipulative murderer embroiled
in a homosexual love triangle. And if you didn't catch the episode
in which Chris Sarandon was framed by his wickedly conniving wife
for his lover's murder, you missed last season's finest hour on TV.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not too late. The Practice should be on the air for
quite some time. The brilliance starts again tonight. Watch it.
Make up your own mind. But I'm sure you'll agree with me. I've made
my argument. This brainy series is the best show you're not
watching.
</P>
<P>
   Case closed.

 &HT;    Ethnic studies program comes to UT at long last
 &HT;    By Angela Shah
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ University of Texas administrators are searching
for a full-time professor to head up a new Asian American studies
department scheduled to start offering classes for the fall 1999
semester.
</P>
<P>
   The new program comes in response to a three-year campaign by
Asian American and other UT students, said Richard Lariviere, UT
associate vice president for international programs. Administrators
hope by March to hire a full-time professor, who would develop a
curriculum. Administrators also plan to hire two junior faculty
members in the fall 2000 semester and one junior faculty member in
the fall 2001 semester.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great concept and idea and is something that is
needed,'' said Jolna John, student director of UT's Asian American
affairs committee. ``We're a large part of the university
population, and people sort of forget that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Asian American studies program will join other more
established programs at UT such as African American studies and
Mexican American studies at a time when some are questioning the
role of ethnic studies in the university curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say ethnic studies programs, which were created largely
because traditional programs ignored minority contributions to
American history and culture, promote segregation on America's
campuses. They argue that ethnic programs should be integrated into
American studies programs.
</P>
<P>
   Ward Connerly, a University of California regent and an
outspoken critic of race-based programs, recently called for a
review of that system's ethnic studies programs.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Siemer, president of Students for Equal Opportunity, a UT
student group opposed to affirmative-action admissions in colleges
and universities, said he opposes UT's decision to create an Asian
American studies program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would question the usefulness of an Asian American studies
program,'' Siemer said. ``(Ethnic programs) tend to balkanize
society.''
</P>
<P>
   But UT's Lariviere said critics fail to distinguish between ``a
political agenda and an interest in ethnic studies as a simple way
of ordering information.''
</P>
<P>
   George Lucas, executive director of the Washington-based
American Academy for Liberal Education, an accreditor of liberal
arts colleges, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asian Americans have a story to tell of their contributions to
our common life,'' he said. ``Asian American studies programs are a
way to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ching-Wu ``Paul'' Chu, a Chinese American, made the
groundbreaking discovery of materials that were superconducting at
room temperature, meaning that they are capable of carrying
electricity without resistance, unlike copper wiring. Or, many
people do not know that U.S. forces during World War II included a
battalion of Japanese Americans. UT students began their campaign
for the Asian American program four years ago and won the support
of then President Robert Berdahl. But Berdahl's departure to head
the University of California at Berkeley in 1997 stalled those
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Berdahl's successor, Larry Faulkner, put the Asian American
studies program on the fast track. He plans to spend $60,000 to
$80,000 on salary for the professor who heads the program. Which
department will sponsor the program depends on the professor's
discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``One in six students at UT has an Asian American identity. It's
about time,'' Faulkner said. ``Their history, culture and
experiences in this country . . . are part of the past, present and
future of American culture and Texas culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner, who helped to establish an Asian American studies
program at the University of Illinois three years ago, said he
understands critics' arguments that ethnic studies can be divisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also true that, I think, people need to understand where
they came from and where they are now,'' he said. ``There's no harm
in maintaining an Asian American identity.''
</P>
<P>
   At UT, Asian Americans _ a broad ethnic category that includes
Americans with roots tracing back to India, Vietnam, China and
Japan _ are the second-largest minority group on campus. Enrollment
for the fall semester includes 5,613 Asian American students, up
about 300 from last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Administrators have tended to overlook Asian American
concerns,'' said Hemant Shah, director of the University of
Wisconsin's Asian American studies program. ``But Asian American
groups have been more active on campus in the last 10 years than
ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin has had a program since 1991 even though Asian
Americans make up less than 1 percent of the students. Asian
Americans make up about 16 percent of UT's students.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian American studies program will be separate from UT's
Asian studies program, which focuses exclusively on languages and
cultures of Asian countries. That curriculum does not include the
experience of Asian immigrants and their descendants in America.

 29-COX &HT;    The race is on to solve Y2K problems
 &HT;    By George Bennett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH _ In a windowless room with mismatched office
furniture and carpet the color of a spent cigarette filter, three
programmers tap away at computer keyboards in a $4.9 million race
against time.
</P>
<P>
   The programmers, hired at $48 to $65 an hour from a Jacksonville
service, are part of an army of about 45 public employees and
outside contractors going through the Palm Beach County
government's 4.7 million lines of computer code _ program by
program, line by line, byte by byte _ so it won't crash and burn
when Jan. 1, 2000, arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide discussion of computerdom's year 2000 problem is
dominated by prophecies of doom. But county government computer
managers believe they are winning their race against the dreaded
millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
   And most other local governments and public agencies in Palm
Beach County also claim their computer systems will be ready by
2000 to churn out utility bills, tell jailers when to release
inmates, maintain student transcripts, open and close floodgates on
canals and perform other important tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving this readiness will cost Palm Beach County taxpayers
up to $21.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem _ also called the millennium bug or Y2K _
is the elementary programming glitch that has made many computer
systems unable to handle the change from 1999 to 2000. The problem
is rooted in the practice, held over from the old punch-card days
when computer memory was scarce, of expressing years in two digits
instead of four _ ``98'' instead of ``1998.''
</P>
<P>
   When the year ``99'' becomes ``00'' in a little more than 15
months, most people reading the double-zeros will readily
understand them to mean 2000. But the rigid logic of many computers
will assume ``00'' is 1900. Without reprogramming, experts say
systems will shut down or begin spewing out bad information.
</P>
<P>
   The problem would seem to have been apparent decades ago, but
businesses and governments around the world generally haven't paid
attention until the last few years. A variety of explanations for
the procrastination are offered in the computer world; most boil
down to human short-sightedness.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have pegged the worldwide cost of fixing the
problem at anywhere from $600 billion to $1.5 trillion. Making the
federal government's computers millennium-worthy will cost $5.4
billion, according to the Office of Management and Budget. Florida
estimates it will cost up to $90 million to update state government
systems.
</P>
<P>
   In Palm Beach County, the county government's system is the
largest and most expensive to fix among public agencies. The South
Florida Water Management District is spending more than $1 million
to enable its computers to handle the date change. The school
district estimates its Y2K efforts will cost $750,000.
</P>
<P>
   An exact tally of year 2000 costs is difficult to estimate
because computer systems are regularly upgraded anyway and
millennium de-bugging is often part of larger overhauls. In some
cases, the looming millennium appears to be hastening improvements
that might otherwise have waited.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at it as an opportunity because we're in the
middle of transitioning our hardware and software,'' said Riviera
Beach City Manager William Hunter. The city has not come up with a
cost estimate for fixing the problem or set a target date for
completion.
</P>
<P>
   West Palm Beach is spending about $2.5 million on a variety of
upgrades that include Y2K fixes. Most of these changes eventually
would have been made anyway, computer manager Bill Swisher said,
but the expenses were accelerated by the non-negotiable deadline of
Jan. 1, 2000. Swisher estimates about $100,000 of the city's
expenses are because of the year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   Boca Raton, Boynton Beach, Florida Atlantic University and the
county Property Appraiser's Office also are making seven-figure
computer expenditures before the millennium. But as in West Palm
Beach, computer managers say those expenses aren't only to address
the year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   The appraiser's office decided on a $2.2 million computer
overhaul that includes Y2K fixes after estimating that rewriting
code on old systems solely to address the 2000 problem would cost
nearly $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Many smaller governments have been spared these big costs. They
generally use off-the-shelf software packages from outside vendors
and are relying on assurances from those vendors that programs will
be ready for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Delray Beach is one of several cities that hasn't set aside any
extra money for fixing the year 2000 problem. Computer manager
Richard Zuccaro says he has complete confidence in software company
HTE of Lake Mary, which has an $88,640 annual contract with the
city to provide upgrades, including year 2000 fixes.
</P>
<P>
   Larger entities, such as the county government, have bigger
expenses because they have more sophisticated programs with large
amounts of code written specifically for them.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these users have hired outside programmers on a
temporary basis to help rewrite code. In addition to 35 of its own
staffers, the county has a total of 10 programmers working on Y2K
projects from two companies: Compunnel Southeast and Nine Rivers
Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville-based Compunnel was the county's second choice of
seven firms that proposed solutions and management strategies for
the year 2000 project. The county's top choice, Emerald Business
Systems, had to back out because of another commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Although it hired Compunnel to help manage the project, county
staff have been heavily involved in all decision-making. If the
year 2000 work fails, county project manager Irene Manning says,
government officials will be to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, though, local government officials are optimistic
there won't be any blame to shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel real confident that we've looked at all the systems,''
says Swisher of West Palm Beach. ``Either they were already
compliant or we're making them that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one will know for sure until Jan. 1, 2000, arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Says Dale Blomberg, manager of the school district's Y2K
efforts: ``I'm sure something's going to jump up.''

 &HT;    Patient Brown nets big game role
 &HT;    By Greg Wille
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ They say that good things come to those who
wait. ReShawn Brown has done his share of waiting, and now there
are indications that he will do plenty of good things for Southwest
Texas this season.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a senior running back, played sparingly in his first
three seasons as a Bobcat despite showing promise in a limited
role. For the last three years, the rushing chores were handled
almost exclusively by Division I-AA All-American Claude Mathis, who
finished his career as SWT's all-time leading rusher (4,691 yards)
and scorer (294 points).
</P>
<P>
   Throughout that period of time, Brown simply wanted the
opportunity to show he could be successful as well. That desire is
now a reality, and Brown is reaping the rewards of his patience.
Although the SWT offense has struggled in its first three games,
Brown's early-season performance has created optimism for a unit
that currently ranks last in the Southland Football League in total
offense (266.3 yards per game) and scoring offense (12 points per
game).
</P>
<P>
   Through three games, Brown has rushed for 269 yards on 46
carries, an average of 5.8 yards per run. He had a 177-yard
outburst at Northern Arizona, including an 80-yard touchdown run
that gave the Bobcats a brief lead in the second quarter of their
38-16 setback two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Texas (1-2) needs a similar performance from Brown in
its SFL opener against Northwestern State, the eighth-ranked team
in Division I-AA. Considering that the Demons (3-0) are allowing a
mere 12 points per game and have a road win over Division I-A
Southwestern Louisiana to their credit, that won't be an easy task
for Brown. Kickoff is 7 p.m. tonight at Bobcat Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Although the game against Northern Arizona was a breakthrough
performance for Brown, he says that his personal sucess didn't
provide any consolation as the Bobcats led 13-10 at halftime but
suffered a major breakdown after halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to have the game I had, but it was all for naught
since we lost in the end,'' Brown said. ``On every offensive play
(in the second half), somebody did something their own way instead
of doing it the way we've been taught. In the end, that's what
makes you lose ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown says the SWT offense was plagued by similar problems last
week in a 17-3 home loss to seventh-ranked Hofstra, but he doesn't
think the Bobcats need to drastically alter their strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to stick to the basics and still use the same game
plan,'' Brown said. ``It's important for us to keep believing in
the system. We just need to work on refining our plays and
executing our offense. I guess you could say that we've had our
opportunities but just haven't capitalized.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of opportunities, Brown's first significant one came
early last season in SWT's 28-24 loss at Hofstra. With Mathis
hampered by a leg injury, Brown picked up the slack by rushing for
82 yards on 15 carries. Although Brown's playing time the rest of
the year continued to be limited, he impressed SWT Coach Bob
DeBesse enough to earn a starting role this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That game (vs. Hofstra) was a starting point for me,'' said
Brown, who already has his degree in exercise and sports science
and is currently taking graduate courses. ``It was my first chance
to show I could play.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's commitment to the program apparently impressed his
teammates so much that they elected him as a team captain for the
1998 season, which came as a total surprise to Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really shocked because I'm not a very vocal guy,'' Brown
explained. ``I just go out and try to work hard in practice. I
don't feel like I've done anything special, but in their eyes I
guess I have.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leadership role has been a challenge for me. I have more
people depending on me, and I need to push my teammates more. I
would like to lead by example, but as a captain I realize that I
need to be vocal.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5 feet 8 inches and 179 pounds, Brown doesn't exactly
resemble the typical workhorse running back. However, with the SWT
offense struggling and two of its top receiving threats, slotback
D'Angelo Torres and tight end Justin Young, questionable for
tonight's conference opener with injuries, does Brown want to carry
a larger part of the offensive load for the Bobcats?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have to carry the ball 30 times a game, that's just the
way it is,'' Brown said. ``Whatever my role is, it's all for the
team. I'll do what is required.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like someone who has learned that, yes, patience is a
virtue.

ancestral land _ a 2.5-acre abandoned parking lot _ on which the
Oklahoma tribe could build a casino, bringing in much needed money
to his town and making the Indians rich. Now the Delawares want the

in a Mexican jail, he paid more than $100,000 to get out. But State

</P>
<P>
   WILLIE-BROWN (San Francisco) _ A year before he faces San
Francisco's voters again, Mayor Willie Brown is getting decidedly

   NEGRO-LEAGUER (San Francisco) The home run race between Mark
McGwire and Sammy Sosa has been a remarkable feat but both players

Heritage Month. Oppressed European Americans, who are about to

alone, and caused other millions of Europeans to board ships so
they could become Americans. By ROB MORSE.

Rockefeller is the face of the 1960s in this town, as Hugh Carey is

George Pataki is likely to be the face of the 1990s. He's going

   ROSENFELD-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ Impeachment or resignation of

   BOEING-COSTS (Auburn, Wash.) When Boeing President Harry
Stonecipher pointed to the cause of his company's recent losses, he
never mentioned it by name. But then with a moniker like DCAC/MRM,
that's probably not a bad thing. A close look at Boeing's attempts
to reduce its manufacturing costs, and whether they're working.

   AUBURN, Wash. _ Two numbers, labeled ``actual'' and ``target,''
glow electric red:

</P>
<P>
   This tiny space at the Boeing welded duct center in Auburn has
not produced enough. No problem: The floor manager can see that
production has fallen short and shifts workers to this line of
workbenches from elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The production problem at the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group
is that things are not keeping pace. In addition, the way the
company designs and produces aircraft makes it incapable of setting
the pace right to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   When Chairman Phil Condit announced in July that the company
would fall hundreds of millions of dollars short in profits, it was
not a problem of the company business environment. Boeing
Commercial, its largest division, has a huge backlog of business.
It has only one competitor. It is at the top of an economic cycle.
It should be immensely profitable.
</P>
<P>
   That it is not is something the company did to itself, said
Chief Operating Officer Harry Stonecipher. It ensnarled itself on
the shop floor.
</P>
<P>
   To meet the ambitious financial goals Condit set, the company
also aims at an operating goal: to double the speed at which parts
move through Boeing's factories.
</P>
<P>
   Managers hope to raise inventory turns _ the number of times
each year Boeing empties out the warehouse of goods _ to four from
two. This revolution has not happened yet. The number is stuck at
two, as far as managers know.
</P>
<P>
   Changing that number is the focus of a gargantuan effort at
Boeing. One manager calls it ``on the scale of redoing the economy
of Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's factories are governed by a system set up to manage the
building of the B-17 bomber during World War II. It is called
``tab-detab,'' or for some forgotten reason, ``effectivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of identifying an airplane and listing what parts go on
it, effectivity does it backward: It identifies the parts, and
lists what airplanes they go on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, it worked great,'' says Robert Hammer, Boeing's
vice president and chief economic reformer. ``We had a single
customer _ the government _ and a non-variable airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the company has a world of customers and sells each airplane
as a custom product. Yet, it is still mired in tab-detab, with
paper drawings _ thousands of them _ for each airplane.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's manual,'' Hammer says. ``It's error-prone. It's a
nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's computer can't fix it, because Boeing doesn't have one
computer. It has some 650 systems that grew up over 30 years and
often can't communicate. For tracking parts, the company has 14
systems that generate 14 bills of material.
</P>
<P>
   Says Hammer, ``We have people who do nothing but check between
these things.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill-of-material checkers are valuable employees: It takes
two years to get good at it. But detecting mistakes takes time,
during which production workers, given the wrong orders, continue
to make the wrong parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Wichita six months ago,'' Hammer says. ``They
scrapped out 4,000 parts just because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The system is beyond redemption, Hammer says. ``We can't fix it
anymore. We've got to kill it and start over.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan to kill it was approved five years ago by Boeing
Commercial's then-boss, Ron Woodard. It was called by what Hammer
concedes is the ``god-awful acronym'' of DCAC/MRM, which stands for
Define and Control Airplane Configuration, Manufacturing Resource
Management.
</P>
<P>
   DCAC (pronounced dee-kak) is to do several things:
</P>
<P>
   First, it will jettison the 650 computer systems and replace
them with machines running commercial, off-the-shelf software.
</P>
<P>
   Second, it will use one bucket of data and generate one list of
parts from data entered once.
</P>
<P>
   Third, it will change many aircraft options into standard
equipment and many custom parts into options, so Boeing can operate
more like an automaker than a construction company.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, it will manage standard parts separately from optional
and custom parts so the whole aircraft is no longer treated as a
custom job.
</P>
<P>
   An example of changing options into standard parts is the
bulkhead between the 747 landing gear and rear cargo hold. It has
2,550 parts and comes in four options: a hole on the left, a hole
on the right, both holes or no holes. The holes are for heat or
air-conditioning ducts. Currently, the bulkhead is custom-made and
ordered 2{ years in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Under DCAC, the bulkhead will be a standard item with two holes.
If a hole isn't needed, workers will cover it with a plate.
``That's a lot cheaper,'' Hammer says.
</P>
<P>
   An example of custom options is the toilet seat. One airline
specified a color for the toilet seats on its 777s and noticed an
extra $20,000 on the bill. The airline thought the color, which was
a standard option on the 757, was the same on the 777, but it
wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   The $20,000 toilet seat raised an alarm. ``We backed down,''
Hammer says. ``We didn't charge them anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But once it gets options and standard features straightened out,
Boeing will charge something like $20,000 for a toilet seat if it
is truly a custom job.
</P>
<P>
   These reforms sound simple enough. But the implementation has
been anything but simple. The effectivity system ``has got
tentacles throughout the whole company,'' Hammer says. It is
ingrained, part of the ``tribal knowledge'' of engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also is pursuing simplicity with a big, top-down program.
It even has an entire lexicon, explained in a 33-page booklet
called ``DCACronyms.'' In this brave new world, SMEs
(subject-matter experts) are trained to pass on their knowledge to
SKUs (site key users) at the CPL (Center for Process Learning). MPs
(material planners) are expected to learn the use of DOPE (detailed
order planning and execution), during which they CRUD (create,
read, update, delete) their computer files in order to KUTD (keep
them up to date).
</P>
<P>
   The DCAC/MRM organization has been in business for 4{ years,
peaking early last year at 3,000 to 4,000 employees out of 108,000
in the division, and declining recently to about 2,500.
</P>
<P>
   The payoff from all this effort is not yet obvious, and some
question it. One exasperated manager, looking at DCAC from the
outside, described it this way: ``It's a black hole. It swallows
people up. People are still carried on the budget, but they're not
there anymore. They just kind of disappear, and there's no increase
in output.''
</P>
<P>
   To the idea that DCAC will pay for itself, says this manager,
who asks not to be identified, ``Their attitude is, `We're going to
save money no matter how much it costs.' ''
</P>
<P>
   How much is it going to cost? Fortune magazine put it at $1
billion. Hammer declines to name a number, but says: ``A whole pot
full. It's big.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds: ``This is an investment. Yeah, it is a very costly
investment. But we should never have to do this again.''
</P>
<P>
   DCAC is being implemented in three stages. Parts plants were
brought in by last December, so 25,000 employees use the system
now. Engineering _ recalcitrant Dilberts, in some eyes _ are to be
fully initiated in the new system by June 12, raising the user
total to 55,000. All active users _ about 60,000 _ are to be on the
system at the beginning of the new century.
</P>
<P>
   A second effort, lean manufacturing, is supposed to make
common-sense changes on the factory floor. It also has its jargon _
takt time, andon, kanban. By no means cheap, it has the merits of
being less costly than DCAC and being easier to understand.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of lean manufacturing is to get rid of waste.
</P>
<P>
   Big savings are made possible by adjusting work flow so that
products _ or the parts to build them _ don't pile up. ``You want
that product moving, because you're paying for it while it's
sitting,'' says John Black, director of lean manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   In lean manufacturing, one key to managing is to keep each
system small.
</P>
<P>
   At Auburn's process assembly plant, an area of 500,000 square
feet, the floor had been divided into the kind of work done. A
worker who had to drill holes sent the item to where they drilled
holes. Boeing thereby economized on drills. The movement of each
product might be complicated, but managers could track it by
computer, using a wand and bar code. It was high-tech.
</P>
<P>
   The new system divides the work into product line. Each product
is in its own area. To do this, plant manager Neil Currie had to
spend $4 million to $5 million, much of it to duplicate machines he
already had.
</P>
<P>
   The new system does not economize on machines. It economizes on
workers. In the old days, somebody had to move a 747 auxiliary
power unit duct 7,400 feet around the building _ nearly 1{ miles _
to have various things done to it. Now that duct moves only 900
feet. The time needed to work on it has shrunk to about eight days
from 25.
</P>
<P>
   And the computer they used to track it with is no longer needed.
Workers used to scan a bar code on each part every time it moved.
``But now we can see it,'' Currie says. ``We don't need the
computer to tell us where it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Killing the computer is one ironic insight of 21st-century
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the ordering of parts: The old, high-tech way was to
centralize it and have the computer track who needs what. The new,
low-tech way is to let each unit order its own parts. You put the
parts into bins. You look in the bin, and if it's near empty, you
order more.
</P>
<P>
   This visual signal, a Japanese concept, is called a kanban.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Shotwell, a manufacturing supervisor at the process
assembly plant, shows the bins where his team is doing this. Many
of the parts used to be ordered by employees in Lynnwood, he says.
They had to keep inventories much higher, because they couldn't see
into bins in Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the little flags. Workers who needed an inspector
used to walk, often several hundred yards, to sign a log book. Now
they reach back and put up a red flag _ an andon.
</P>
<P>
   The result of all this, says plant manager Currie, is that in
two years, he has increased production by more than 50 percent, and
he has done it by adding fewer people than he would have under the
old system. He also has freed up one-quarter of his floor space.
</P>
<P>
   Over at the welded duct plant, Scott Cunningham, line manager
for 737 close-out panels, has just finished a workshop in which he
had to paste photos of each work step in his cell on a large
cardboard sheet, with black lines for product flow. The diagram
helped him work out a way that cut down on the rework of error and
used four fewer people.
</P>
<P>
   One of his workers, lead mechanic and 30-year Boeing veteran
James Dagenstein, came up with an idea for a table tipped like an
artist's easel. Dagenstein drills holes _ some 3,000 per day _ in
flat metal parts, and figured it would be easier at a 75-degree
angle. Dagenstein's table made the work more efficient, and also
saved floor space.
</P>
<P>
   Welded duct general supervisor Thomas Ritzert has freed up
enough floor space for another Japanese idea, the ``moonshine
area.'' Here, a worker tries out a new way to make hydraulic
reservoirs by testing his ideas in foam and wood. ``Instead of
brainstorming, we try stuff,'' Ritzert says.
</P>
<P>
   Such is manufacturing at Boeing at the dawn of the 21st century.
Work will be paced as much as possible to minimize inventories. But
there is no mass replacement of people by robots, or by computers.
There is no soulless march to ever-bigger processes. Some workers
will be replaced by computers, but some computers will be replaced
by plastic bins and colored flags.
</P>
<P>
   John Triplett, general manager for strategic initiatives, has
reached the part of the welded duct plant untouched by the reforms.
He casts a jaundiced eye on the wooden parts warehouse. It is
centralized, categorized, computerized _ an example of 20th-century
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, by the end of next year, we'll get rid of this
thing,'' he says.

`FELICITY' IS BEST NEWCOMER OF THE FALL TV SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is ``Felicity'' as good as its advance buzz? Possibly not, since
the expectations have risen higher than Ally McBeal's hemlines.
</P>
<P>
   But is it better than any of the other newcomers on the fall
schedule? Absotively. You betcha. Take it to the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that can come close to it _ ``Sports Night'' _ is
from the same studio, Ron Howard's Imagine Television, which says
something about the influence of moviemakers on the quality of
television programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicity'' has the look and feel of a motion picture, thanks
to its creators, J.J. Abrams (``Regarding Henry'') and Matt Reeves
(``The Pallbearer''). It's all about independence, making decisions
and taking charge of one's life, and it centers on Felicity Porter,
a freshman at a university in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Keri Russell is astonishing as Felicity, a young woman
determined to follow her own path, not the one selected by her
parents. That path would have taken her to Stanford, where
everything was prearranged by her influential father to fit into a
well-ordered plan. Instead, on a whim inspired by Ben Covington
(Scott Speedman), a boy she barely knew (but secretly liked) in
high school, she crosses the country to New York _ a scary place to
matriculate.
</P>
<P>
   Felicity learns rather quickly that following a boy isn't the
best way to pick a college. But she's intent on making her own way,
or, more precisely, on not letting somone determine it for her.
</P>
<P>
   A talented supporting cast and a knockout script may help fans
of ``My So-called Life'' finally get over their separation funk.
Scott Foley is friendly, unthreatening and just a little geeky as
Noel, the resident advisor on Felicity's dormitory floor, and Amy
Jo Johnson is startlingly on point as Felicity's first _ and best _
friend in a frightening new environment. Toss in Speedman's
balanced portrayal of the complicated Ben, and ``Felicity'' is the
real deal, a poignant exploration of those heady days of young
adulthood, when every decision is a big one, and the wrong ones
seem so devastating.
</P>
<P>
   As for Russell, it's easy to gush. The camera loves her, but
that usually happens whenever an accomplished actor is able to
interpret the script with subtlety and grace. Maybe it's just
clever lighting, but Russell has about her a glow that is
irresistibly charming. She deserves the stardom that is sure to be
hers.
</P>
<P>
   If it were on one of the big networks, ``Felicity'' would kick
some serious gluteus in the ratings. As part of The WB's lineup,
its ratings won't be as gaudy because the network's distribution
system is still growing. But wherever it settles, ``Felicity,'' it
turns out, is our good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   We should also consider ourselves lucky if we never cross paths
with Mr. Chapel. He's a wacko.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Michael Madsen (``Reservoir Dogs''), a veteran of more
than 40 films, brings an eerie intrigue to the main character of
``Vengeance Unlimited,'' which ABC has placed in the slot where ABC
shows go to die: 8 p.m. Thursdays.
</P>
<P>
   Its premiere Tuesday night is an attempt to lure the regular
``NYPD Blue'' audience. Even its executive producer, John McNamara,
seems to view the Thursday slot as the network's handshake of
death. In a letter that accompanied a tape of the second episode,
which will air this Thursday, McNamara said: ``Given the history of
that glorious slot, the 50 or so critics who watch this (tape) may
represent our largest non-acquaintance audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Airing against ``Friends,'' one of NBC's Thursday night
powerhouses, ``Vengeance'' will face the same uphill battle that
``Nothing Sacred'' and ``High Incident'' encountered before being
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming ABC offers ``Vengeance'' its usual lack of support in
the face of stiff competition, Mr. Chapel's days may be numbered.
Too bad, because ``Vengeance Unlimited'' isn't an awful show. It is
dark and violent, though, and putting it on at 8 o'clock is stupid
and thoughtless, since it focuses on a man bent on righting wrongs
with his own brand of twisted justice _ an ``Equalizer'' for the
'90s, if you will.
</P>
<P>
   McNamara, who also is co-creator of the show, considers it part
thriller, part satire. Accordingly, Madsen plays Mr. Chapel in the
less-is-more style: quiet, uninflected voice; severe lack of
expression. He adds the occasional smirk to keep us wondering if
he's a bonafide nut job or if he's just putting us on.
</P>
<P>
   KC Griffin (Kathleen York) seems none too sure, either. But
having been a beneficiary of Chapel's kindness, she reluctantly
helps him out on other cases.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever a murderer or other heinous criminal walks free because
justice needs glasses, the mysterious Mr. Chapel goes into action.
Each week's story inovlves the unusual means by which he exacts his
revenge, ultimately getting the baddie to fall into the trap and
admit his transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the golden rule, but it's effective. Besides, CBS has
the golden rule covered with ``Promised Land'' in the same time
slot. Surely there can be a show for people with baser instincts,
no?

CLINTON WAGES ELECTION-STYLE BATTLE AGAINST IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To hear President Clinton tell it, he has not read
the report by independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr and is leaving
the legal maneuvering to his lawyers. The president said he is too
busy focusing ``on what I'm doing for the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to some of his closest advisers and the
president's own grand jury testimony, Clinton is reenacting the
1996 election, when he was his own campaign manager. He is
approving tactics, studying polls, and courting Democrats and
moderate Republicans with intense appeals to stave off impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, indeed, has been making phone calls to numerous members
of Congress without informing his aides, leading one presidential
ally to tell White House communications director Ann Lewis that
Clinton was ``off the reservation'' with the phone calls. But Lewis
responded that Clinton was ``not off the reservation. He is the
reservation. Bill Clinton does not sit passively by.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans think the parallel maneuvers of a presidential
election have gone too far and accuse the White House of a negative
campaign of leaking information about adultery by Republican
members of Congress. Clinton aides vehemently deny such tactics,
though strategic leaks have clearly been part of the White House
repertoire. In Clinton's grand jury testimony, made public Monday,
he said he authorized the release of letters written to him by
Kathleen Willey _ a former White House volunteer who alleged
Clinton made an inappropriate advance toward her _ to undercut her
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's effort to stave off possible impeachment is being
coordinated by Gregory Craig, the lawyer who helped successfully
argue an insanity defense for John Hinckley after the attempted
assassination of President Reagan. It is an irony not lost on
Craig's friends, who say he is relishing the chance to defend
Clinton against Starr's allegations that the president committed 11
impeachable offenses stemming from his affair with Monica S.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``He defended a person who tried to assassinate the president in
one case, and now he is defending a president against a political
assassin,'' said Nick Littlefield, a Boston lawyer and former aide
to Senator Edward M. Kennedy who has known Craig for many years.
</P>
<P>
   But John Feehery, spokesman for House majority whip Thomas
DeLay, questioned whether it was appropriate for a lawyer who ``got
John Hinckley off'' to help Clinton try to avoid impeachment. Craig
did not respond to requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Craig's deep ties to Democrats are
expected to help Clinton within the party. Craig was the lawyer for
Kennedy during the Florida rape trial of Kennedy's nephew, William
Kennedy Smith, and later was the lawyer for Smith in a separate
assault-and-battery case. Craig also has a rapport with Republicans
because he dealt with many bipartisan foreign policy issues when he
served on Kennedy's staff.
</P>
<P>
   But Craig's best asset may be his relationship with Bill and
Hillary &UR;  &LR; Rodham Clinton since all three were classmates at Yale Law
School. ``There is a lot of trust and ability to speak frankly back
and forth,'' Littlefield said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig may be spending much of his time nailing down what should
be Clinton's ``base'' _ Democrats on Capitol Hill. Mrs. Clinton has
participated in this effort, calling members such as Representative
James Moran of Virginia, who has been critical of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing is to make sure where the Democrats are,''
said Alan Baron, an impeachment specialist familiar with the White
House strategy. ``The next issue is whether there is any
possibility of getting moderate Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Clinton recently talked with his former rival for the
presidency, Bob Dole, about helping court Republicans. But Dole was
noncommittal. ``We're in the very early stages of a proceeding
that's going to last for a while,'' Dole said last week on the
``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also wooing moderate Republicans who might bolt from
the party leadership and balk at impeaching the president _ House
members such as Representatives Connie Morella of Maryland and
Nancy Johnson and Christopher Shays of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Shays's view for now is comforting to the White House. Unless
new information turns up, he said, he does not see anything in the
Starr report to persuade him that Clinton should be forced out of
office. But Shays left open the option that he could vote for
impeachment, thereby letting the Senate decide whether to oust
Clinton. ``I lean toward the position that if I vote for
impeachment, I believe he should be removed.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear that Clinton can persuade enough Republicans
to support him. The GOP controls the House 228-206 and needs only a
majority vote to approve articles of impeachment. Some Democrats
worry that if House Speaker Newt Gingrich pushes the party to
impeach Clinton, the White House may be powerless to stop the
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat who
sits on the House Judiciary Committee, said while Clinton, in a
sense, is running another presidential campaign, there is a major
difference. ``Many of the votes the president needs to get are
Republicans who have made up their mind, and there is nothing he
can do to win them over,'' Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   If the House impeaches Clinton, there would be a trial in the
Senate, which is controlled 55-45 by Republicans. Clinton's chances
are better in the Senate because it would take a two-thirds
majority to convict and oust him, meaning that Republicans would
have to pick up 12 votes from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, White House officials believe Senate Republicans will
eventually concede they do not have the votes to convict Clinton
and will settle for some type of plea bargain from the president.
Thus, Clinton last week sanctioned a proposal _ suggested by allies
ranging from his former counsel, Lloyd Cutler, to Senator John F.
Kerry _ that the president be censured by Congress and pay an
undetermined fine.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's best defense so far has his high job-approval poll
ratings. Earlier this year, when allegations first surfaced about
Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky, Clinton called up his former
adviser, Dick Morris, and asked him to conduct polls to gauge the
reaction. Recently, Clinton has relied on surveys by the White
House pollster, Mark Penn.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Aug. 17 grand jury testimony, which was televised on
Monday, made clear the president was involved in the release of
information damaging to Willey.
</P>
<P>
   Willey alleged in a ``60 Minutes'' interview that Clinton made
an inappropriate sexual advance, groping her near the Oval Office.
Clinton told the grand jury that after the broadcast, he decided
the White House would release letters that Willey wrote to him
after the alleged incident. The letters showed Willey being
complimentary to the president and calling herself Clinton's ``No.
1 fan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When `60 Minutes' came with the story and everybody blew it
up, I thought we would release it,'' Clinton testified about
releasing the letters. ``You know what evidence was released after
the `60 Minutes' broadcast that I think pretty well shattered
Kathleen Willey's credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, there were questions whether Clinton's allies played
a direct role in leaking to reporters that the president became
enraged during his grand jury testimony and stalked out of the
room. When the videotape was aired, it included no such sequence.
The result was predictable: Clinton exceeded expectations. To some
observers, this mirrored what happens in a presidential campaign,
when aides downplay expectations for a primary vote or a debate,
and then say the candidate did better than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides deny having anything to do with the leak about
the videotape. But they do say the way for Clinton to avoid
impeachment is to relearn the lessons of his two successful
presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has figured the way out,'' White House counselor Paul
Begala said about Clinton. ``The smartest thing for him to do is to
do his job.''
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, Clinton's words underscored his strategy. He no
longer issued a daily statement of contrition about his affair with
Lewinsky. Instead, he blasted Republicans for failing to focus on
issues that concern the typical American, urging that Congress
``put people first.'' The theme _ indeed, the exact words _ came
straight out of Clinton's 1992 campaign playbook.

   (Resigning) ... would expose Clinton to the obvious moral wrath
of Starr in a criminal, rather than political, process. I would not
agree to punitive sanctions or future criminal action after he
leaves office, as some have recommended, as a solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``My legal strategy ... would be to demonstrate there is no
persuasive evidence of a criminal intent regarding the obstruction
allegations. And I believe that Clinton was persuasive in providing
an alternative explanation of his state of mind at the time of the
Jones deposition.

   ``Perjury is a demanding statute, it is not an easily available
vehicle for prosecutors, particularly outside a grand jury context.

Clinton had criminal intent to violate that law beyond a reasonable

   ``My advice to my former student (is) stand by your grand jury
testimony, which was impressive and produced sympathy for you.
Disregard advice that you confess to perjury and obstruction of
justice. Those who want you to do that are the same folks who said
if you would only confess to an intimate relationship with Monica
Lewinsky all would be forgiven. They are the same people who want
you to testify before the House Judiciary Committee. They are not
your friends.

<P>
   ``Instead, acquiesce in the will of the people, who want the
whole mess behind them, and discuss it no more. Do your job. You
will survive.''

   ``(Clinton) had to testify before the grand jury. But he cannot
help himself, legally or politically, if he keeps blabbing. The
demands that are being made on him are crazy and he should stand
aloof from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has got some problems. ... Obviously, his explanation is
not overpowering on the crucial issue of did he have sexual
relations with Lewinsky. His problem on that is primarily factual
in the discrepancy between him and Monica and what role he played.
Did he reciprocate or didn't he? His story is very hard to believe.

that contradiction. She is an admitted liar and a perjurer.''

   ALAN DERSHOWITZ, the Harvard Law School professor who
successfully defended Claus von Bulow in the second attempted
murder trial of his wife Martha ``Sunny'' von Bulow:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it is very difficult to keep him out of jail. It
is not a triable, convictable case. There is too much vagueness,
too much uncertainty. The fact is, the president managed to wiggle
his way through perjury or obstruction charges, but at great cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``By wiggling out of the criminal charge, he has made it harder
to stay in office. His answers, though non-perjurious, seemed
evasive and false. ... What I think he ought to do is elevate the
nature of the debate. The question is, `Is it legal or political' _
and it is neither. It is constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should claim this is an attempted coup d'etat by elitists
in Congress, the media, and the religious right designed to undo an
election. The president benefits from portraying Congress as
partisan and political. ... He should speak from a very high
plateau _ that he has to preserve the office of the president from
attacks from Congress, that it is his duty to stay in office, and
if they want to remove him they must take the political risk. He is
not going to do their political work for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I would add someone to the legal team like George Mitchell
or Warren Rudman ... who can talk to the president as an equal, and
not worry about being fired. ... He needs a man or woman who can
tell him what he does not want to hear, while keeping David
Kendall, who is an excellent criminal lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is the president has spoken too much. ... He
should not ever appear in the well of the Senate, or say another
word in a legal context. He is put in a postion where he has to
split hairs, and you are better off letting your lawyer do the
hair-splitting.''

his legal situation so that he is not indicted after he leaves the
presidency, but also preserves something which is almost, if not
equally, as important _ that is remaining as president. The
reality, even if he were to be indicted afterwards, is he knows he
has significant defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is what he should do: Number one ... the Republicans'
prospect of the election has them chomping at the bit, and it
imposes a dynamic that is not productive for him. So he should
continue to do his job, keep his approval ratings up very high.
Number two, he should send everybody around him out _ his lawyers,
his political colleagues _ to talk about what a great job he has
done as president, that the American people elected him, and
Congress has no right to disenfranchise the voters. Number three,
(argue that) that whatever he has done here does not amount to an
impeachable offense. Four ... continue to criticize Ken Starr's
aggressiveness and tactics.

jury, but he would be smart not be to the spokesperson for those

PARTIES FIND COMMON GROUND ON THE CLINTON AFFAIR: DON'T IGNORE IT

 By CHRISTOPHER MATTHEWS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gail Kaufman, a Democratic consultant in
Sacramento, Calif., advises candidates running this November to
play it tough on their man in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody is not taking a hard position against Clinton,
they can be hurt,'' she said last week. ``You have to say, `What he
did sucked.'''
</P>
<P>
   Political insiders from both parties are predicting the Nov. 3
election will be at least in part a referendum on President
Clinton's future _ whether voters are ready to abandon their
elected leader because of the never-ending sex scandal that has
settled over his administration or to send his foes a message that
they are tired of the whole thing. Both Democratic and Republican
consultants are tailoring their advice accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman, who represents a number of California legislators from
liberal areas, said it was important that candidates speak out on
their deepest convictions: ``This is one of those issues _ like
abortion or handgun control _ that they can't dodge the question.
They've got to have a real good reason for their vote. It has to
come from their gut.''
</P>
<P>
   If Democratic advisers urge candidates not to hide from the
issue, Republican consultant Dan Schnur stresses that Republican
office-seekers not look too anxious. ``Rather than making character
an issue in your race,'' he advises his clients, ``use it as a
backdrop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no need for (Republicans) to bring it up
pro-actively,'' said Schnur, who served as a senior strategist for
Gov. Pete Wilson. ``The press will bring it up anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Carrick, who has mapped campaign media strategy for Sen.
Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and this year is helping New York
Democratic Rep. Charles E. Schumer in his Senate race against
Republican incumbent Alfonse D'Amato, recommends his clients get
the Clinton issue over with quickly and then try to change the
subject of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think an important thing to do is just to try to get into
subjects _ health care, schools, crime, the environment _ voters
really care about,'' the Los Angeles-based consultant advises
Democratic candidates. ``The fastest way to do that is not to duck,
but basically answer the question as straightforwardly as they
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, in other words, need to focus on the issues that win
for them by ``first addressing the issue that's being talked about
the most,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carrick, like Kaufman, argues that the smart approach is to give
brisk, direct answers to voters' and journalists' questions about
Clinton. ``The important thing is just to answer, then move beyond
that and think about things that voters really care about,'' he
said. ``They (candidates) make a mistake if they get into a frame
of saying, `I don't want to talk about it.' This is a continuing
series that never ends. It's better off if it's dealt with right up
front and move on with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the ultimate verdict on Clinton, interest in a
candidate's views can be expected to magnify early next month as
the House Judiciary Committee votes on whether to commence formal
impeachment hearings. If the panel votes in favor of such action,
this would lead to a vote by the entire House before Congress
recesses for the election. That means every incumbent member of the
House would be required to vote ``aye'' or ``nay'' before facing
the voters in the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   For Republicans, the Clinton scandal presents an obvious
opportunity. What's important, GOP advisers say, is that they not
appear to be exploiting the issue for sheer partisan gain.
</P>
<P>
   Kellyanne Fitzpatrick, who polls for Republican candidates, said
GOP candidates should not ``tell their voters what they already
know.'' Instead, they should use the president's predicament to
talk about the country's ``moral decline'' and the ``breakdown of
the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican consultant, Suzy DeFrancis, urges candidates
to focus not on Clinton's dalliance with Monica Lewinsky, but the
``serious crimes like perjury, obstruction of justice and abuse of
power'' he may have committed in trying to keep the affair quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has disgraced the office,'' DeFrancis asserted.
``We must follow the rule of law and let the Constitution provide
us with help. Let's move forward and get the truth out. This is
about future generations. What value do we put on the truth?''
</P>
<P>
   Such strong talk reflects the partisan intensity of the national
debate. Polls show a division among those who want to see Clinton
punished in some fashion _ censure, removal from office,
resignation _ and those who want the whole matter of his
relationship with the young intern and attendant cover-up dropped
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole issue is just about party in terms of how voters
look at it,'' Carrick argued. ``Democratic voters look at it as a
frame-up, an out-of-control prosecutor. The Republican voter looks
at it the opposite: The president caused all this; he ought to be
held accountable for it. The independents tend to hold both views.
They don't like (independent counsel Kenneth) Starr. They don't
like the president's behavior. What it does to turnout is
speculative at this point.''

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many experts, including Carrick, have said that the
Clinton-Lewinsky scandal would further dampen voter turnout at the
polls, even below the historic lows predicted for the Nov. 3
election. They expect Democrats to take the hardest hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conventional wisdom is that the issue will bring out
Republicans who are more outraged,'' Carrick said. ``After the tape
(of Clinton's grand jury testimony) was released, it seems to me
there's been more energy on the Democratic side, and a little bit
of deflation on the Republican side.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Democratic campaign consultant, Gary Nordlinger, said
the potential exists for the scandal to backfire on the Republicans
if they don't find evidence of a clearly impeachable offense.
``Since Day One, the risk wasn't about him having an affair, it was
about obstruction of justice,'' he said. ``So far, that hasn't
turned up.''
</P>
<P>
   The one bit of advice common to the consultants on both sides is
for candidates to speak from the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Schnur, Republican: ``Tell them what you think. Give them
your honest opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Gail Kaufman, Democrat: ``Anybody, regardless of their district,
can vote their conscience _ as long as they have one.''

THE MIDEAST'S PATRIARCHS ARE BOWING TO AGE AND ILLNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Middle East's trio of political patriarchs _
Jordan's King Hussein, Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and
Syrian President Hafez Assad _ have presided over most of the last
50 years in this volatile region.
</P>
<P>
   They have survived wars, outlasted countless insurrections, and
dodged assassins. They have at times clung to the hatreds of the
past and at times gambled on the future of peace.
</P>
<P>
   But now forces far beyond their control _ old age and ill health
_ raise questions about how long they will stay in power, and what
will happen when they are not.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein, 62, has admitted to having lymphatic cancer and is
undergoing chemotherapy. Arafat, 69, whose lower lip and hands
tremble incessently, is rumored to be suffering from Parkinson's
disease. Assad, 78, has been frequently hospitalized for what some
belief is a severe kidney problem. dismiss any talk about their
deteriorating health, although it is evident in their public
appearances. Arafat, Assad
</P>
<P>
   All three of these historic figures look gray, gaunt and
unsteady, even as they and their aides dismiss talk about their
deteriorating health.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts are actively assessing what the Middle East
will look like without these three leaders. Who will succeed them?
How will the political landscape shift under the next generation of
leadership, and will these movements cause greater upheval or a new
terrain of stability?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are nearing the end of the era of the strong man,'' says
Radwan Abdallah, a political science professor at the University of
Jordan. ``These three leaders took a gamble on peace that we
thought would change the face of the Middle East, and it
unfortunately did not. But what is sad is that they cannot live
long enough to make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Shimon Shamir, who resigned last year as Israel's first
ambassador to Jordan and also served as ambassador to Egypt, says,
``As this century closes, we are going to see dramatic changes of
the map of leadership in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   The Middle East, perhaps more than any other region, is still
ruled by authoritarian regimes. Shamir and others point out that
beyond Jordan, Syria, and the Palestinian Authority, the region is
full of regimes in which a lone ruler is growing old and infirm.
</P>
<P>
   In Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Abdullah is poised to replace King
Fahd, believed to be about 75 and still suffering from the stroke
he suffered in 1995. In Egypt, President Hosni Mubarak, 70, is
considered in fine health but after 17 years in power will have to
soon consider a successor. In Libya, Muammar al-Qadhdhafi who has
led a dictatorship for nearly 30 of his 60 years, recently had an
extended stay in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``When these leaders started pan-Arabism was the reigning
ideology,'' says Shamir. ``Now legitimacy of the nation states have
been established. It is a new period of globalization. An emerging
middle class that wants to see more change. It is a new mood, and
the rhythm of change will have to match that.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdallah and many other Arab anlaysts believe the expected
legacies for King Hussein, Arafat and Assad are not encouraging.
There are mounting problems in the Arab world: a crumbling economy,
surging unemployment, vast corruption and a rise in religious
extremism. The next generation of leadership will face daunting
challenges. And each country will face a different set of
circumstances surrounding succession.
</P>
<P>
   In Jordan, there is little question who will take the thrown
when Hussein dies; the king's youngest brother, Crown Prince
Hassan, has been the designated heir for 33 years. High ranking
Israeli intelligence officials say they are confident the
transition to power will be smooth, and that Hassan will work to
move the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein is a forceful, charismatic character who embodies
the country he rules. He is an Arab prince descended from the
Prophet Mohammad, a military strategist, a statesman, and an avid
pilot. His portrait adorns offices and homes throughout the
country. More than 80 percent of his subjects have known no other
ruler.
</P>
<P>
   But his brother _ an anglophile fond of polo, and considered
more of an intellectual than a monarch _ is no King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Academics and analysts point out that the majority of Jordan's
population are Palestinian refugees from what is now Israel, and
many reject Jordan's peace treaty with Israel. Hassan is considered
out of touch with this population and is also viewed as weak among
the Bedouin tribes which have upheld the Hashemite kingdom since it
took power in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is apprehension here because he is a new and an unknown
quantity,'' said one former Jordanian official. ``The economy is
bad, the peace plan is failing, and there are questions about
whether he has the leadership qualities necessary to bring Jordan
into the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Palestinian Authority, there are constant whispers of
Arafat's deteriorating health. Aides dismiss his quivering lip and
apparent feebleness as due to the injuries he suffered in a plane
crash over Libya in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the rumors of succession are persistent. And the list is
long. Two of the leading candidates are Arafat's top aid Mahmud
Abbas, known as Abu Mazen, and his head of security Jibril Rajoub.
They are vastly different men.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Mazen is generally considered the candidate of the political
status quo and, as critics point out, would probably continue to
allow Arafat's inner circle to profit from the rampant corruption
that has disillusioned so many Palestinians. Rajoub is considered
more strident, and more militant. Although he has cooperated with
Israel on security matters, some believe he is more likely to
confront Israel if push comes to shove. He has a brother who is
active in the Islamic militant organization Hamas, and Rajoub is
considered to be more in touch with the groundswell of radical
Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever the successor, he will have to grapple with stalled
peace talks, growing disillusionment and a stagnant economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arafat is a symbol for all Palestinians, a unifier. When he
dies, there is no one who can stand as that symbol. That is a
potentially very destabalizing situation,'' says Dan Schueftan, a
consultant to Israel's Foreign Ministry and a professor of Middle
East history at the University of Haifa. ``If you have a society
that does not yet even have the beginnings of a civil society,
freedom of the press, and a middle class, then it is much easier to
mobilize such a society for confrontation with Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   In Syria, posters on the walls in Damascus proclaim, ``Basil,
the example: Bachar, the future.'' They refer to Assad's two
beloved sons.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Basil, an army captain and oldest son, was
being groomed to inherit the presidential mantle. But in 1994 he
was killed when his Mercedes crashed in the fog.
</P>
<P>
   Now Assad's other son, Bachar, is reportedly the reluctant heir
apparent. He is a British-trained optomologist who loves computer
technology _ an unlikely leader for a country in which a strong
military rules.
</P>
<P>
   Although Assad's successor is supposed to be chosen through the
constitution, it is likely that Assad will handpick his successor.
But the Assad family is from the minority Alawi sect of Islam, and
its possible the Sunni majority, which has many powerful generals
among them, will resist the rule of Bachar.
</P>
<P>
   For now Assad _ who made a fruitless peace overture to the
Israelis during the heady days of 1991, after the Palestinian and
Jordanian peace treaties with Israel had been signed _ continues to
be an isolated ruler. He made his first trip out of the country in
22 years when he went to France this summer. As fears mount that
political instability could be triggered by presidential
succession, and the economy continues to falter, Assad's government
clings to a culture of secrecy and oppression.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a dinosaur,'' says Schueftan. ``He has never come to
terms with the fact that the world has changed. And when he dies or
is replaced by someone else, we are likely to see sweeping change
there.''

CELEBRATING THE MELTING POT WITH A PARADE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ October is just around the corner, and you're
probably making your plans for European American Heritage Month.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we'll enjoy parades of European cars, much like the usual
parades of BMWs and Volvos we see in the San Francisco Bay area.
Maybe we'll eat continental cuisine and watch European movies _
with subtitles for those who aren't fluent in European.
</P>
<P>
   Oppressed European Americans, who are about to become a minority
in California, can celebrate their culture, the one that united
Europe in wars killing millions in this century alone, and caused
other millions of Europeans to board ships so they could become
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Don't ask me how we celebrate European American Heritage Month.
Ask the California Legislature, which passed the resolution
creating it, or Assemblyman Lou Papan, the Democrat who introduced
the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Ask a Bay-area group called the European American Issues Forum,
which got Papan to introduce the resolution, or a member of the
group named Stan Hess, who thought up this idea to celebrate white
people.
</P>
<P>
   According to the San Jose Mercury News, in January Hess was
arrested with a Ku Klux Klan grand dragon in Alabama for burning
Mexican and U.N. flags. In February, Hess disrupted a San Jose
meeting of people taking part in President Clinton's national
conversation on race.
</P>
<P>
   Hess was shouting, ``We are not gringos or white bread. We want
our own land.''
</P>
<P>
   What land is that? Europe?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Gov. Pete Wilson has an idea how to celebrate European
American Heritage Month. He signed the month into law. Wilson has
altered the calendar more than the Mayans, Egyptians and Hugh
Hefner combined. Last Friday was our new Native American Day.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but European Americans get a whole month.
</P>
<P>
   You might think it's only fair that European Americans get a
block of time from the Legislature and the governor, since gays and
African Americans get a month each, and almost every other identity
group in California gets some chunk of the calendar.
</P>
<P>
   But as a white American, I get nervous about a month that's
meant to celebrate the accomplishments of white Americans.
</P>
<P>
   White people have done much to make this the great country it is
today. On the down side, though, white people have made other
people feel the need to have pieces of the calendar they can call
their own, because historically they didn't get much else to call
their own.
</P>
<P>
   You won't see me in the European-American parade, and not just
because I don't own a European car. I may be white, but I'm not
European American. That name is what philosophers call a ``category
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   There are Americans who think of themselves as Irish Americans
or Italian Americans, but no Americans think of themselves as
European Americans. Humans come from cultures, not from a vast,
multicolored area of a map.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the term European American doesn't include the English,
the very people whose name gave California that imprecise epithet,
``Anglo.'' England isn't in Europe. Ask an Englishman.
</P>
<P>
   The British smashed a Spanish fleet and a German air force that
tried to make them part of Europe. They don't much like the Chunnel
or the Eurodollar either. They call Europeans ``continentals.''
</P>
<P>
   So how come my genes from Manchester, England, aren't honored
with their own holiday? Surely California has a day left on the
calendar for the culture that gave America a language to which we
could add words like ``empower'' and ``multicultural.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't want a day. My ancestors weren't all English, and all I
really know for sure is that I'm American. That's my culture, and
despite the macaroni-and-cheese, I find it empowering.
</P>
<P>
   We're all part of that American culture, and thank God for that,
and the tortillas, barbecue, dim sum and lasagne, too.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one sign of how united our diverse society is
linguistically. Stan Hess, the inventor of European Heritage Month,
told the Mercury News that when he disrupted the presidential
conversation on race in San Jose, he said he found it
``consciousness-raising and empowering.''
</P>
<P>
   Aren't those words all Americans want to get rid of? Frankly, I
find the idea of a politically correct white people's movement
extremely disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, don't think the Democratic candidate for governor, Gray
Davis, will be any better at dividing up the calendar than Pete
Wilson. During a recent debate with the Republican candidate, Dan
Lungren, this is what Davis said he would do to nurture cultural
diversity:
</P>
<P>
   ``I would try and remind people by proclaiming days, maybe a
Jack Kavanaugh Day (a Los Angeles television reporter and
questioner at the debate), because you're well thought of in Mexico
City ...''
</P>
<P>
   Davis went on and on, dropping the name of another journalist at
the debate, but remaining completely incomprehensible otherwise.
One could only conclude that, under a Davis administration,
everyone in California would get his or her own day.
</P>
<P>
   That's nice of him, but it makes for very skimpy parades.

CONGRESS ASSAILS CLINTON RESCUE PLAN FOR RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For days, top officials of the Clinton
administration have spoken in soothing tones about a rescue plan
for Russia. Loans, investment, and a generous dose of good will can
help the country recover from its crisis, they suggest.
</P>
<P>
   But the vague strategy has met with criticism from analysts and
outright ridicule from Democrats and Republicans alike in Congress.
Even some administration officials who watch Russia concede that
Russia is abandoning a market economy, curbing its fight against
corruption, and rebuffing other prescriptions from Americans.
</P>
<P>
   More troubling, several of the officials admit that Washington
has not promoted over the past few years the right medicine for
Russia's growing economic, political, social, and environmental
ills.
</P>
<P>
   The vast gulf between the administration's upbeat public
pronouncements and the glum forecasts of academics, business
executives, and members of Congress has been clear this month as
one Senate and House committee after another has explored Russia's
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical reprimand earlier this month, Representative
Benjamin Gilman, a New York Republican who chairs the House
International Relations Committee, publicly scolded two of the
administration's Russia experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe our government has not only been lied to by
high-level Russian officials, but has ignored important signals
over the last few years that all is not well, both in Russia and in
our relationship with its government,'' Gilman told Lawrence
Summers, deputy secretary of the Treasury, and Strobe Talbott,
deputy secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can Russia change when the success story of our foreign
policy which was portrayed by our administration just two years ago
has turned into the dismal failure of our foreign policy that it
appears to be today?''
</P>
<P>
   Such remarks are hardly limited to Republicans. A few minutes
later, Lee Hamilton, the top-ranking Democrat on the committee,
chimed in, ``The mood in Congress ... is sour towards Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's transformation from Cold War enemy to stable democratic
partner was to be the Clinton administration's great foreign
triumph.
</P>
<P>
   The administration supported President Boris N. Yeltsin when he
sent tanks to pummel Parliament in 1993 and when he masterminded a
disastrous 20-month war in the breakaway province of Chechnya that
cost almost 100,000 lives. The White House justified its support
because Yeltsin and his ``energetic young reformers'' were working
to achieve the political transformation of the century.
</P>
<P>
   But the new prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, has shown an
interest in Soviet-style central planning, price controls and
currency restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Primakov rose to power two weeks ago, Congress was
already angry because a $4.8 billion loan from the International
Monetary Fund, endorsed by the Clinton administration, did little
more than prop up the ruble temporarily and make money for a small
group of speculators.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF had planned to send Russia the rest of a loan that
totals $22.6 billion, but the next installments have been postponed
because Russia is in default to foreign creditors who hold $40
billion in treasury bills and other instruments. The Clinton
administration says Russia must do more to curb inflation, protect
investors, collect taxes, and establish laws that work before
getting more loans, but the administration has not specified
exactly how far Russia must go to reach these goals or how long it
should be given.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying before the International Relations Committee, Dmitri
Simes, president of the Nixon Center, warned, ``We should be
prepared to refuse to throw good money after bad. We should start
developing an exit strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Simes hinted that the United States might have to consider
disengaging from Russia and letting Moscow founder on its own, a
tactic that would have been unthinkable from a serious scholar just
a few years ago. ``We have to face the facts and be ready for any
eventuality, as unpleasant as it may be,'' Simes said.
</P>
<P>
   Such pessimism contrasts with the administration approach that
is based on active engagement with Moscow. Summers told Congress
earlier this month that the US government will agree to resume IMF
loans ``when we can be confident that that support will be well
used.'' And Talbott, who has visited Russia twice in the past five
weeks, warned against turning away from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``To disengage would be to give up on it,'' he said. ``To brace
ourselves for a crash of Russia would be to increase the chances
that the crash would occur.''
</P>
<P>
   In private, officials admit they fear chaos in Russia, no matter
what Washington does. A widely respected official in Washington,
who can talk comfortably about bridge loans and NATO cooperation,
recently was asked what the United States should do about Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Panic,'' he responded.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been holding high-level meetings for five
weeks on the issue. The meetings are usually held at the Treasury
Department or the White House, and are led by National Security
Adviser Samuel R. Berger or Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin,
Summers, or David A. Lipton, the Treasury undersecretary for
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   One senior US official said that Primakov understands that
Russia cannot turn away from the United States or recklessly print
money. But he added, ``We have to to be realistic about all of the
pressures for Russia to head in the wrong direction.''
</P>
<P>
   With the support of the Communist-dominated Parliament, Primakov
has named two senior economic officials, First Deputy Prime
Minister Yury Maslyukov and Central Bank chairman Viktor
Gerashchenko, who have proposed printing rubles to pay Russia's
debts, a policy that most specialists say will lead quickly to
hyperinflation.
</P>
<P>
   Maslyukov, a moderate Communist who once headed the Soviet state
planning agency, also has proposed government support of Russia's
massive and insolvent defense industries.
</P>
<P>
   As the Soviet Central Bank chief in 1991, Gerashchenko oversaw a
Draconian currency reform that erased the savings of millions. He
also served as Russia's top banker from 1992 to 1994, when
inflation soared. Jeffrey Sachs, the Harvard economics professor
who advised the Russian government in 1992, once called
Gerashchenko ``the world's worst central banker.''
</P>
<P>
   Such judgments do little to bolster faith in Russia's new team
of economists. But many in Congress, from Alabama conservative
Republican Spencer Bachus to Vermont's iconoclastic liberal Bernard
Sanders, are convinced that Washington's solutions have not worked
for Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Bachus, Sanders, and others on the House Banking
oversight subcommittee received some advice from Boris Kagarlitsky,
an adviser to the State Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament.
``If there is one thing we need from the West now,'' Kagarlitsky
said, ``it is for them to leave us in peace.''

ENOUGH OF THE STARR REPORT'S DYSFUNCTIONAL MORALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Impeachment or resignation of President Clinton
to resolve the messy Monica Lewinsky affair would undermine the
institution of the presidency, a price not worth paying to punish a
rampaging libido and the efforts to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   Removing Bill Clinton from office for his offenses would reward
the transparently political machinations that sought to bring him
low for many years.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more weighty criticisms to be made of Bill Clinton in
this whole affair is how his outrageous behavior nourished these
efforts to impair his presidency. He had no worse enemy than
himself.
</P>
<P>
   His behavior deserves condemnation and were he able to run again
for the job, rejection by the electorate. But he can't run again.
And his offenses so far specified do not appear to rise to a level
warranting impeachment. His transgressions were matters of
unacceptable personal behavior, not matters affecting the nation or
the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   If legal consequences arise from his sworn testimonies, they
should be borne by him in a civil trial after he finishes serving
his term.
</P>
<P>
   Neither should he resign, because resignation, like impeachment,
would reward the focused political partisanship that snared him in
his foibles. This argument is made not to spare Bill Clinton. It is
made to avoid encouraging future transparently partisan vendettas
as the Kenneth Starr investigation has been and as party line
behavior by the Republicans in the House of Representatives is
becoming.
</P>
<P>
   If this president can be made to surrender his office for these
kinds of offenses, then future chief executives, including those
with higher personal morals, would be held hostage to similar
efforts. If political zealotry succeeds once to overturn the
election returns, others will surely follow.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's sexual encounters were not the only ones
committed by presidents in the White House. The particulars of his
adventures are especially offensive, doing it just outside the Oval
Office with an intern some 30 years his junior. But others before
Bill Clinton also used the premises in objectionable ways. The
notable difference between them being what they did was kept secret
until long after they left office.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress who are preparing themselves to sit in
judgment on Bill Clinton themselves don't come to this matter with
having lived exemplary lives, and the American people know it and
rightfully resent it.
</P>
<P>
   It was pertinent to have revealed that among the more active
moralists in Congress turned out to be one representative who felt
himself forced to confess to having fathered a child out of
wedlock, and another outspoken congresswoman who, it turns out, had
an affair with a married man.
</P>
<P>
   Even Henry Hyde, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee
considering whether to proceed with the impeachment process, had,
as he said, a youthful indiscretion. That euphemism covered a
relationship with a married woman not his wife, which happened when
he was in his 40s, hardly a decade of youth. Mr. Hyde, like Mr.
Clinton, has difficulty speaking plainly about matters that hit
close to home.
</P>
<P>
   Those who deplore these revelations are seeking to play a
hypocritical game. If personal behavior is to figure so largely in
our public life, then standards need to be applied across the
board.
</P>
<P>
   If all members of Congress were required to take an oath, how
many would tell the unamended truth about any sexual wrongdoing?
Posing the question shows what ridiculous lengths we are beginning
to reach. Policing the private lives of public figures tenaciously
leads only to disaster. Already George W. Bush, the governor of
Texas, has expressed second thoughts about running for president.
He fears putting his family and himself through this kind of
puritanical examination.
</P>
<P>
   It is time for sex to be shoved back into the closet, where it
belongs. This society has reveled in being titillated for too long.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that egregious sexual behavior is beyond criticism, but
we should not tolerate the lurid and pornographic modalities
Kenneth Starr resorted to in the name of upholding virtue and
justice. That is as much a symptom of dysfunctional morality as
what it purported to indict.

CONGRESSWOMAN DRAWS LESSONS FROM WATERGATE ERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Web address is CQ)  
 Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Back in 1974 when Zoe Lofgren was a law student
at Santa Clara University and an aide to Rep. Don Edwards, she
learned a ton about presidential impeachment law. Edwards, a
Democrat, sat on the House Judiciary Committee that explored
impeachment proceedings against Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I would need to use any of this again,'' said
Lofgren, who is now a Democratic representative from the San Jose
area and a member of the House Judiciary Committee. ``Call it a
coincidence, a quirk of fate, the hand of God, whatever, but here I
am, in the same place.''
</P>
<P>
   In the shrill din of our nation's capital these days, Lofgren's
calm, well-modulated voice has emerged as one of the few of
consistent sanity. While colleagues on both sides of the
congressional aisle have clamored for President Clinton's instant
impeachment or resignation, Lofgren has called for caution and set
up a Web site (www.house.gov/lofgren/watergatereport.html) that
details and explains the articles of presidential impeachment.
Documents from the '74 Judiciary Committee's findings are included.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frenetic here,'' Lofgren said late one night last week
from her Virginia home. ``People want to have five-minute answers
to questions that take longer than that to answer. It becomes
bizarre. People are behaving as if we have no time, but we do have
time _ and we have a constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   While the U.S. Constitution does not specify what its creators
meant by ``high crimes and misdemeanors,'' the nature of the
transgressions they had in mind is very clear, Lofgren said:
``Crimes that will lead to the destruction of the government,''
crimes that render the president unable ``to discharge his
constitutional duties.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the independent prosecutor's argument that breaking
any law impairs presidential function? In his 445-page report to
Congress, Kenneth Starr said that it is a president's
constitutional responsibility to ``take care that the laws be
faithfully executed ... The president has a manifest duty to insure
that his conduct at all times complies with the law of the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Such logic, said Lofgren, would mean: ``If you jaywalk, should
you be impeached?''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Lofgren equates Clinton's admitted extramarital sex and
lying about it with mere jaywalking. ``It's more serious,'' she
said. But the congresswoman recalled the felonies committed by
Nixon that were deemed not impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if you cheated on your income taxes? Should you be
impeached?'' Lofgren said. ``Well, in '74 they (Congress) said no.
Not only did he (Nixon) cheat on his taxes, he stole money and
didn't declare the illegal income.''
</P>
<P>
   With highly ``personal behavior'' like Clinton's, Congress must
grapple with even more of a ``floating standard'' for impeachable
behavior, she said. Thus, the prudent course is to understand the
times and intentions of the Constitution's authors.
</P>
<P>
   Everything we know about them indicates they considered
impeachment a last-resort remedy. Not by accident did they
establish a system of government that ``elected one guy who would
be accountable for four years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachment was for extraordinary disasters like taking bribes
and committing treason,'' Lofgren said. ``The `high crimes' they
imagined were crimes capable of destroying the constitutional
system of government. It must be something so dangerous that the
country can't wait for another election because there won't be any
government left.
</P>
<P>
   ``To remove someone for anything less is a coup.''
</P>
<P>
   Lofgren is up for re-election in November. Unlike many
Democrats, however, her Republican opposition _ retired engineer
Horace Thayn _ isn't even a remote threat. That relieves Lofgren of
some pressure, but it doesn't remove most of her burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many forces trying to make me do one thing or
another,'' she said. ``I don't look at that as an evil thing; it's
natural. But I have to make sure I'm doing what I think is right.
This is about the structure of society and our government. It's
about whether my 16-year-old, when she's 50, has a parliamentary or
a constitutional government.''
</P>
<P>
   Admitting that the weight of her responsibility is cutting into
her sleep, Lofgren said: ``Whatever we do, it has to be what is
right, not for our particular party or for the president, but for
the country. Before we're Democrats or Republicans, we're Americans
_ or we should be.''

IN BALKANS, AN AFTERMATH OF BITTERNESS

<TEXT>
<P>
   PALE, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ Radovan doesn't live here anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The white stucco house, with its imposing wall and wrought iron,
looks out of place set amid so many more humble homes, summer
homes, really.
</P>
<P>
   Radovan Karadzic is the world's most wanted war criminal. Yet
his home here looks like something out of ``Goodfellas.'' Rather
than house the man who held the international community hostage
during the war in the former Yugoslavia, his gaudy, incongruous
villa looks like something a bookie would put up in one of the
seedier parts of town.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the city of Pale looks like one of any number of
God-forsaken American towns, only worse. The roads are littered
with potholes that look like shell craters, but that are simply a
symptom of Pale's status as international pariah.
</P>
<P>
   Just how this was the nerve center of the people who carried out
the war in Bosnia, and perpetrated some of the worst war crimes in
recent memory, is unfathomable.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what is so unnerving about Bosnia. It seems normal,
but it's not. There is always, beneath the surface, the Balkans'
insatiable hatreds. Winston Churchill once said the Balkans had a
propensity for ``producing more history than it can consume.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumption, however, does not appear to be a problem in postwar
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sarajevo is bustling these days. Benetton, the first upscale
foreign business to set up shop after the war, has even removed the
sandbags from its storefront. But some see the busy cafes and
restaurants as something of a facade, a western town on a Hollywood
sound stage.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Bennett, director of the Balkans Project for the
International Crisis Group, worries that the international
community is propping up the region without forcing the various
ethnic groups to share power as part of the quid pro quo. The
recent elections in which extreme nationalists gained at the
expense of Western-backed moderates have left many here gloomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything here is artificial, nothing is self-sustaining,''
said Bennett, sitting in the patio of an Indian restaurant that,
like most others in Sarajevo, is doing a roaring business.
</P>
<P>
   Little is made here. Traffic in the Bosnian capital is madness,
because so many of those behind the wheel are not from here. The
natives have seen so much that reckless driving is only a venial
sin. One in eight people in Sarajevo is either a foreigner or part
of the international community presence. If they left, many
ordinary people say, Bosnia would probably drift back to its old,
separatist, murderous ways.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Karadzic is a fugitive, his neighbor, Vasilija Bozic, is a
refugee, one of 3 million created by the 1992-1995 war. More
specifically, she is one of the 120,000 Serbs who fled Sarajevo and
won't, or can't, go back. She blames the Muslim party, the SDA, for
whipping up sentiments against Serbs like her.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the Serbs I knew didn't care about the Serb party,'' she
said. ``My neighbor across the road was a Muslim. Once this
political party started talking, she put out the Muslim flag, they
sang Muslim songs. This is what politics do to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbs are usually portrayed as the bad guys, a portrayal that
can only be reinforced by the Serbian offensive in Kosovo, which
has driven tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians from their
villages and prompted NATO to threaten Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic with air strikes. In sheer numbers, Bosnian Muslims have
suffered more than any group in the former Yugo-slavia.
</P>
<P>
   And yet there are Serbs like Bozic who are also victims of the
great hatred that bubbles throughout the Balkans. She cannot or
will not go back to Sarajevo, where the cafes are filled with
people, most of whom, unlike her, do not consider it home.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Muslim neighbor had a son who got killed. I cried for him.
I knew him. He was a great guy,'' she said. ``But his parents are
sending me a message that I can never return. They are forgetting
all the tears I had for their son.''

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Let's face it:
</P>
<P>
   Just as Nelson Rockefeller is the face of the 1960s in this
town, as Hugh Carey is the face of the '70s and as Mario Cuomo is
the face of the '80s, George Pataki is likely to be the face of the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   He's going into this re-election race with more money than Bruce
Springsteen. His job approval rating is higher than Bill Clinton's,
and Pataki hasn't even winked at an intern, that anybody knows of.
And Peter Vallone is supposed to topple this guy from the
governorship in just five weeks?
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you expect to manage that?'' I asked Vallone the other
day. Hey, he said, I was behind in the primary, too, wasn't I?
</P>
<P>
   Well, yeah, I said, but this is a bit different. This is like
moving up to the heavyweight division after you've been stiffing
160-pounders. If you look at the polls, most voters are perfectly
happy with Pataki, who is a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe that this governor is out of touch and out of
state,'' Vallone, a Democrat, said, referring to Pataki's string of
out-of-state, for-pay speaking gigs. ``He doesn't seem to
understand that we're supposed to be first in things like job
creation _ not lagging behind and fighting with Louisiana for last
place in both job creation and credit rating. He doesn't seem to
understand that there are an awful lot of middle-class people in
this state who understand that their children and their
grandchildren are not getting the benefit of the education we had.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be first in education. We shouldn't be in a
situation where our kids are graduating owing as much money as it
cost for us to own a home. We have three million working New
Yorkers who can't afford health insurance, and you have a governor
who says that everything is great. He says that he's responsible
for all the good things, but he acts as if we don't need any help.
We need a lot of help.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, issues. High road stuff. That's fine when you're ahead. When
you're behind, though, you need some dirt to throw. Got any dirt, I
asked Vallone?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are at least four federal investigations, that we know
of, going on right now - one for releasing and deporting drug
dealers, some of whom re-entered the country and were re-arrested.
And they were released over the objections of prosecutors, which
was absolutely absurd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another is, you know, opening up a huge multimillion-dollar
contract to re-do the Midtown Tunnel in New York City, taking away
from the lowest responsible bidder and giving it to the highest
Republican giver. As recently as the other day, we had a Congress
member and a congressional subcommittee accusing the Pataki
administration of dragging their feet on replacing the tracks when
we had that Metro North railroad accident in Westchester County
because the person who was using that track for freight purposes
and commercial purposes was a high Republican giver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you turn around, it seems there's another, you
know, federal investigation involving this huge amount of money
that this Pataki-D'Amato administration keeps accumulating.''
</P>
<P>
   This ``Pataki-D'Amato administration.'' A nice touch, I thought,
given how much more popular Pataki is than Sen. Alfonse D'Amato,
who's also up for re-election this year and running slightly behind
Rep. Charles E. Schumer, his Democratic opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, though, that for Vallone to somehow pull this off,
he'll need a miracle on the scale of Fatima. Vallone has been an
able public official as speaker of the New York City Council and is
privately acknowledged as a good guy by the Republican hierarchy,
even as they plot to savage him unmercifully through November. And,
sure, New York's Democrats enjoy a 5-3 enrollment advantage in any
statewide race.
</P>
<P>
   But these are fat and happy times. This isn't just an uphill
fight. Barring a slew of federal indictments connected to Pataki's
secretive fund-raising practices, Peter Vallone has five weeks to
scale what looks like a sheer cliff.

SCANDAL TILTS EXECUTIVE-LEGISLATIVE BLANCE OF POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER S. CANELLOS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  As his options become clearer _ a vigorous defense, a plea
for censure, a quiet resignation _ Bill Clinton finds that more
than his own fate hangs in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  While much of the country remains fixated on the president's
admitted relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, a growing number of
scholars are expressing concern about what the scandal might do to
another relationship, the balance of power between the presidency
and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  And, these scholars say, some of the most politically
palatable options _ such as censure or resignation _ could alter
the balance of power more precipitously than impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Clinton should resign because I think it's a bad
idea to sweep this event under the rug,'' said Sidney Milkis, a
presidential historian at Brandeis University. ``There are some
very critical issues that have been put into play, and he should
see them through. ... He's confessed a sin, but he also believes
his presidency has been savaged by the independent counsel. If he
really believes that, he should stand up for the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Fallon, a constitutional law professor at Harvard
University, declared, ``I'm not disposed to favor the rush to
censure.'' He added, ``I guess the worry is that we create a mode
of politics in that the way you fight your political opponents is
you try to dig up dirt and create a scandal around them rather than
debate the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Few disagree that, because of Clinton's actions and the odd
confluence of a private lawsuit and the independent counsel act,
the power of the presidency is at one of its lowest ebbs.
</P>
<P>
   For some historians, the events of the past week _ the White
House groping for a compromise that could keep Clinton in office,
the House Republicans debating yet another release of embarrassing
documents _ raise fears of a permanently weakened presidency, a
system in which the chief executive must bargain and horse-trade
for his own survival, at the expense of issues he cares about.
</P>
<P>
   Such a balance of power, while appealing to many leaders in
Congress, was not envisioned by the framers of the Constitution,
some scholars emphasize. Impeachment, they say, was meant to be a
legal check on the president, not an ongoing process involving
years of investigation and political negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can imagine Clinton saying, `I'll sign this tax-cut bill
if you abbreviate this impeachment inquiry,''' Fallon said.
</P>
<P>
   Resignation, in this scenario, would relieve the immediate
pressure on the presidency, but could lay down a damaging
precedent, suggesting that future chief executives dogged by
independent counsel investigations should make an honorable exit
rather than burden the country with a battle for survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought Nixon would be a once-in-a-lifetime experience,''
said Milkis. ``But here we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Milkis nor Fallon believes Clinton must remain in
office, no matter what his offense, in order to protect the
presidency. Rather, they argue that a formal rendering of Clinton's
fate could preserve more power for the presidency than a chaotic
political compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution does not provide for any intermediate steps to
discipline presidents who misbehave. ``A censure is
unconstitutional,'' Milkis said. ``It doesn't solve anything.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet some other presidential scholars can envision a
resignation further along in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a president who is incapacitated should step down,''
said Michael Corgan, a presidential historian at Boston University.
``I think Woodrow Wilson should have stepped down when he had his
stroke.''
</P>
<P>
   But by Corgan's standard, the president's disabilities must be
more than political. He shouldn't be chased out of office by
Congress. Rather, he must be rendered unfit by a clearly defined
illness or a moral failing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like saying, `The president is sick,''' Corgan said.
``There's nothing wrong with that logic. That is not a step toward
parliamentary government. That's his saying, `I as an individual _
and not my policies, because clearly the public approves of my
policies _ am unfit to continue in office.'''

THE GRAVITY OF PRINT, THE `POP' OF TV 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN and MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The day after Bill Clinton's grand jury testimony was beamed
into our homes, front-page newspaper stories assessed his
performance. The Washington Post said he'd ``vigorously defended
himself'' while The New York Times declared him ``irate and sad.''
In the Globe, he was ``animated.''
</P>
<P>
   But those post-mortems were largely a moot point for the 23
million Americans who had watched the televised testimony. ``Once
you show people 5 to 10 minutes of the real stuff, unedited,'' said
Steven Bill, founder of Court TV and an expert on the court of
public opinion, ``they think they know a lot.'' And they don't need
a headline to tell them which way the wind's blowing.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton testimony marked another pivotal day in a scandal
that has redrawn the relationship between old and new media and
most significantly, between the gravity of the printed page and the
visceral pop of the television screen. In short, despite a
temporary jump in newspaper sales, the primacy of television became
even harder to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Like most major stories, the saga of the president and the
intern had its beginnings in print. Like all major stories in the
late 20th century, it will likely have its ending, or at least its
defining moments, on television.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis de Tocqueville, whom Bill Clinton is fond of quoting,
wrote in 1835 that ``scarcely any political question arises in the
United States that is not resolved, sooner or later, into a
judicial question.'' In 1998, scarcely any political question
arises in the United States that is not resolved, sooner or later,
into a TV spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows this better than Clinton, who played the saxophone
on ``The Arsenio Hall Show'' as a candidate in 1992, the same year
he slam-dunked George Bush during a ``town hall'' debate whose
format favored the TV-friendly Clinton. One endlessly replayed
television picture _ of Clinton hugging Monica Lewinsky at a
meet-the-public event _ has been worth many thousands of words
throughout this scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Many damning words have been written about Clinton in the
nation's leading newspapers. (To date, about 170 papers have called
for him to leave office.) But it may be that the print media never
stood a chance against a president who is the most sophisticated TV
personality of the age, a Johnny Carson-like maestro of the medium.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's better to be lucky than good, and Clinton, the
talk-show president, may be the lucky beneficiary of the
Oprahfication of America.
</P>
<P>
   Infidelity? Office hanky-panky? Phone sex? Cigars, even? Old-hat
yawners to the millions who tune in daily to ``The Jerry Springer
Show'' or ``Sally Jessy Raphael'' or ``Montel Williams.'' On a
typical day, the soap operas that were preempted Monday by the
networks are racier than the Clinton testimony ballyhooed as
``salacious'' by political pundits.
</P>
<P>
   US Rep. Edward J. Markey, the ranking Democrat on the House
Telecommunications subcommittee, says he believes the nation
brought the assumptions of television to the experience of watching
their president testify about sex in a legal setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got `Law and Order,' `L.A. Law,' `The Practice,' `Ally
McBeal,'' said Markey. ``It was the cumulative course-load of
having gone to TV law school, combined with their ability to
evaluate the guests on morning talk shows, which they all applied
to determining whether the president should pay with his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``They walked away with the common-sense decision that they
did not find an impeachable offense,'' concluded Markey.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the cultural context in which Clinton operates is his own
remarkable fluency in the idiom of television. That skill was
evident again during his grand jury testimony, as he made clear
that he suspected ``this unprecedented videotape'' would be
eventually leaked and televised.
</P>
<P>
   His resort to tortured, legalistic evasion has been much mocked
by pundits, who seemed to barely notice the way Clinton maintained
sympathetic eye contact with the camera, and the way he adroitly
crafted sound bites for the larger TV audience as he was being
grilled: ``There's some kind of gotcha game in this deposition.''
``I'm not going to answer your trick questions.'' ``You
(prosecutors) have made this the most important issue in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton has seen enough courtroom melodramas on TV to know
how the beleaguered good guy is supposed to sound on the witness
stand. Television's tried-and-true entertainment values surrounded
this production; during one break in the action, CNN's Greta van
Sustern, sounding for all the world like Dan Dierdorf diagraming a
play on ``Monday Night Football,'' told viewers: ``Here we see
prosecutors trying to set a trap.''
</P>
<P>
   If ``Monica-gate'' has boiled down to made-for-TV sport, that's
one clear way in which it differs from Watergate. That scandal,
driven by two obscure Washington Post reporters, was an
old-fashioned print press story.
</P>
<P>
   Yet from the outset, the ink-stained wretches had a slippery
grip on the first presidential scandal of the modern media era.
Newsweek's Michael Isikoff may have done the hard work needed to
break the Lewinsky scoop back in January. But when Newsweek briefly
held the story, it was hijacked onto the Internet by Matt Drudge
and filtered into the Beltway buzz machine by a Sunday morning TV
talk show.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers believe that chain of events symbolized print's
inability to keep pace with a saga nurtured by a feverish media
culture dominated by 24-hour cable news channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an Internet and cable TV story,'' said Steven
Stark, author of ``Glued to the Set,'' a history of influential
television shows. ``Cable television has kept the story alive for
months and has been hooked on it. ... What you're looking for is a
soap opera.''
</P>
<P>
   In one telling poll taken by the Media Studies Center early this
year, 68 percent of the respondents said they were getting most of
their Lewinsky-related information from television while only 13
percent cited newspapers. A year earlier, when people were asked
were about the source of most of their news, the split was 50
percent television and 24 percent newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in some ways, this distasteful matter has lifted all boats
in the media pool. The Sept. 11 release of Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr's report proved a major boon for a newspaper industry
that was actually better equipped to handle the steamy sexual
material in somber-looking reprints than were the harried
television reporters trying to decide which dirty words were fit
for afternoon TV.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a Pew Research Center survey revealed that of the 48
percent of the public that had read or heard at least part of the
Starr report, 28 percent got that information from newspapers and
only 15 percent were tuned into the television set. The
Philadelphia Inquirer edition that contained the report saw a
stunning increase of 140,000 single-copy sales; the Los Angeles
Times sold an extra 64,000 papers; and Chicago Tribune sales of
that paper were up by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were chary about putting (the Starr report) on the
air,'' noted presidential historian Henry Graff. The Starr report
``enabled the mainline instruments of communication to be
pornographic. ... We've revived the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   That phenomenon notwithstanding, newspapers aren't built to
compete with the instant gratification medium of television. And
many observers think that in a story of this nature, it's a mistake
to try. Print's role is not to replicate television's instantaneous
power, but to bring some depth and context to the dizzying whir of
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an enormous opportunity for print to be the clarifying
medium, if they'll do it,'' said Jon Katz, media critic for Rolling
Stone magazine. ``I think that people who care about the civic life
of the country would flock to a medium they trust. ... They're a
perfect antidote to all this insanity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say the newspapers have delivered the most even-handed
balanced coverage, but in this accelerating culture, print is
always behind the Internet and television,'' added Stark. ``Eighty
percent of the public wants context and balance. But the problem is
that everyone is competing for that other 20 percent.''

COUNSELING CLINTON: FREE LEGAL ADVICE FOR THE PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Congress prepares to vote next week on whether to launch an
impeachment inquiry, President Clinton is under increasing pressure
to abandon his tortured, legalistic denials about what he did with
former intern Monica Lewinsky. But dare he? And what can he do to
keep his job, not to mention stay out of jail? Globe Focus writer
Matthew Brelis asked some of the nation's most effective defense
attorneys and criminal law professors _ a legal dream team of sorts
_ what advice they'd give Clinton. Here's what they said:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ROY BLACK of Miami, who successfully defended William Kennedy
Smith in a rape trial and kept sports broadcaster Marv Albert out
of jail on assault charges:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that half of the commentators who are
criticizing him for being evasive know what goes on in a courtroom.
Clearly, (in the grand jury) he was being set up to take a fall for
perjury. That is why he was being hypertechnical and he evaded all
the minefields. He was technically correct, under the definition,
that they did not have sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem any lawyer would have representing him is all the
political advisers are saying, `Do a mea culpa, just come clean and
we will embrace you because America loves a sinner confessing.'
That is very bad advice. He can't do that, because I guarantee you,
the day he leaves office Ken Starr will indict him for perjury.
That is why a lawyer advising the president has to tell him to do
what he has been doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he says, `I hate the Jones lawyers and Starr's bully
boys, and I am not going to help them and will do everything I can
to confuse the issue,' Congress is not going to like that, and the
American people are not going to like it, but it is the only thing
he can do. Otherwise, he delivers himself into the hands of his
enemies and Starr will indict him and destroy him. Any lawyer
telling him to do anything else is committing malpractice. ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Clinton has any choice but to try and mollify
Congress to save his job. But he can only go so far. None of us
have our own personal prosecutor waiting for us. Someone is parsing
every word he says. They threatened him with obstruction of justice
for wearing a tie. Have you ever heard of anything so ridiculous?''

<P>
   ``If I were representing him I would be very mindful of the fact
that he cannot resign, unless there was some deal struck, because
on perjury there is a five-year statute of limitations so there
would have to be a deal. I would reach out to someone of
prominence, a Republican like Bob Dole, or Colin Powell, to try and
broker a deal. ... Perhaps a censure that would show the requisite
contrition and candor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he remains in office and you try to negotiate it, you've
got to bring Starr into this, because someone there would still
say, `Let's try and indict this guy.'...

refuse to cut a deal?)
</P>
<P>
   ``My initial reaction is to advise him not to testify. ... The
whole grand jury thing was perjury trap. He loses too many points
by doing it. I would not let him go in there as a witness. It will
be a soap orera, a lot of hypocritical posturing.

   MARTIN WEINBERG of Boston, a board director of the National

<P>
   ``My political strategy would be to urge him not to resign and
to focus on the grave national peril of politicians invalidating a
democratic election based on conduct that did undermine or misuse
the powers of government that were uniquely allocated to him. ...
Starr's case is weakest factually on the allegations concerning
abuse of power; in fact they appear to be thrown in to fill a
vacuum. It is strongest on personal conduct ... sex with an intern
and failure to completely answer questions, questions that Clinton
testified persuasively were apparently politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``... Starr's $40 million campaign is more consistent with a
medieval inquisitor than an impartial, neutral, independent
counsel, and I would continue to stress that elections mean
something, and that we, as a society, every time we are
disappointed in the judgments and even morality of elected leaders,
are not going to transfer political power without overwhelming
evidence of abuse of power, and that is nonexistent in this case.

A BLACK STUDENT DESTROYED BY RACISM _ OR WAS HE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When James Byrd was dragged to his death in Jasper, Texas, most
Americans reacted with horror. John Hope Franklin, the Duke
University historian who chaired President Clinton's advisory board
on race relations, reacted with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to sound callous,'' Franklin told the Associated
Press, ``but that's nothing new.'' Racist incidents occur all the
time, he said, citing ``the burning of black churches in previous
years.'' The Jasper incident ``was just more barbaric'' than most.
And then, the AP reported, Franklin told a particularly sad story:
</P>
<P>
   ``A black high school student ... worked for weeks on a paper
for class and submitted it to his white teacher. `It was a
first-class paper. You know what she said? ``Who wrote this paper
for you?'' He was destroyed completely by a casual comment by an
insensitive teacher,' Franklin said. `He was dragged through the
streets and killed, too.'''
</P>
<P>
   This was not the first time Franklin related the tale of the
black schoolboy whose life was ``destroyed'' by the supposed racism
of his white teacher. He had told it 10 months earlier, during a
forum in Little Rock, Ark., that was broadcast to 25 US cities. The
San Francisco Examiner noted that Franklin ``told of a young black
student who worked long and hard on an assignment, only to have his
teacher ask, `Where'd you get the paper?' The boy, Franklin said,
`was destroyed,' quit school, and now lives on the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Query: Is Franklin's story true?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it is dramatic. It powerfully illustrates his
contention that white racism, even when not explicit, still
shatters black lives. But did it actually happen?
</P>
<P>
   After reading the article in The Examiner, a professor of
African history at California State University was moved to contact
Franklin and ask for more information. Charles Geshekter, a
specialist on East Africa and a three-time Fulbright scholar who
studied at Howard University in the 1960s, wanted to know where and
when the event occurred and what was done to discipline the teacher
who had caused such harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was appalled to learn about this incident,'' he wrote. ``As
a university instructor and a member of the ACLU and the Southern
Poverty Law Center, I am always distressed to hear about such
incidents. Thank you very much for providing me with more
particulars.''
</P>
<P>
   But Franklin didn't provide Geshekter with more particulars.
When nearly five months had elapsed with no reply, the California
professor tried again. ``I realize that you are extremely busy ...
but I wonder if you would please take the time to answer my
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Five more months passed. Finally, late in July, came an answer.
``I can provide no more details about the incident,'' Franklin
wrote. ``I do not feel free to reveal the name of the school or the
young student who was tragically mistreated. I do not wish to
expose either him or his family to further unauthorized
disclosure.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to know what Franklin meant by ``further unauthorized
disclosure'' _ after all, he was the person disclosing the episode.
It is even harder to understand his refusal to corroborate a story
that he is in the habit of telling in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a fellow historian deeply concerned about race matters and
historical accuracy,'' Geshekter wrote in a final letter, ``I was
distressed that you would voluntarily `cite' such an inflammatory
`incident' to a member of the press ... yet be unwilling to provide
further specifics.'' Franklin never replied. But he is not silent
about his notion that America still reeks of racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we can't repair in a year,'' he said at Fisk
University in July, ``the damage that's been done persistently,
consistently, and energetically for some 350 years.'' Listening to
him, one would never know that America has made tremendous racial
progress in recent decades. He denounces ``the idea that we should
aspire to a `colorblind' society'' _ Martin Luther King's
aspiration _ as an ``impediment.'' His version of a national
dialogue on race is that ``the white side has been in control of
virtually everything, so they're the ones who need educating on
what justice and equality mean.'' The final report of the
president's advisory board quotes Franklin as saying, ``This
country cut its eye teeth on racism'' and it behooves us to
understand why we are ``so proficient and so expert'' at being
racists.
</P>
<P>
   It seems unlikely that an eminent professor at Duke, the author
of a leading text on black history, would knowingly spread a story
for which he can supply no evidence. But then, it would have seemed
equally unlikely for him to point to ``the burning of black
churches'' as proof of endemic American racism. As Franklin surely
knows, the recent ``epidemic'' of black church burnings was a media
fiction. (More than one-third of the arsonists arrested were black,
nearly half the churches burned were white, several fires were
accidental, and the annual number of church fires is not rising,
but falling.)
</P>
<P>
   So what about the story of the black youth driven into
homelessness by his teacher's insensitivity? &UR;  &LR; Is it true? Hoping to
succeed where Geshekter failed, I called Franklin several times
over the past month. I left messages at Duke and at his home
office. I explained why I was calling and described the information
I was seeking. Twice I was told he would call back ``next Monday.''
So far, I've heard nothing.

INTEGRITY, CHARACTER TOPPING POLITICAL AGENDAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Conn.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Across the country, political candidates this election season
are beginning to talk about character, integrity, and trust with a
pitch more fevered than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal of lies and unfaithfulness that has engulfed
President Clinton has created a new calculus in the run for office,
from Congress to governor. Democrats and Republicans alike are
generally treading lightly, unsure of the exact ramifications of
the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere are Clinton's troubles more relevant than in
Connecticut, where Republican Mark Nielsen is challenging US
Representative James H. Maloney, a Danbury Democrat. Nielsen,
unlike some Democrats, does not shy from talking about Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It elevates the importance of personal integrity and character
of the candidates,'' said Nielsen, a state senator. ``If anything
good comes out of this messy and tragic situation, it is if the
public focuses on the need for people of unimpeachable integrity
and character.''
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen doesn't mind talking about integrity and character
because he thinks these are qualities that Maloney lacks. Maloney's
brother, Robert B., paid a $256,000 fine and served 60 days of home
confinement for funneling $39,000 of his own money through
co-workers at Smith Barney in Boston to help James get elected to
Congress in 1996. Robert subsequently also lost his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are definite questions of trust with respect to
Congressman Maloney,'' Nielsen said. Besides running for office
using illegal donations, Maloney is also ``stiffing creditors,''
Nielsen claimed. He said Federal Election Commission reports show
that Maloney owes money to businesses he patronized in 1994, during
his first run for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps President Clinton's problems will cause people to
focus more directly on these issues,'' said Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few weeks ago, there was no particular character to this
off-year election,'' said Marshall H. Wittmann, director of
congressional relations at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative
think tank. ``No one knew what type of pattern was being
established. It was peace and prosperity. Peace and prosperity has
now been replaced by character and morality.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, Republicans expect to pick up at least 10 to 15
additional seats in the House of Representatives; three to six
seats in the Senate; and one to three governorships, according to
the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt all along this cycle that we are in a good position to
make up for some of the losses we sustained last time,'' said Mary
Crawford, spokeswoman for the National Republican Congressional
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Republicans are as direct as Nielsen in making the
connection with Clinton. Former US Representative Peter Torkildsen,
a Massachusetts Republican, will not raise the issue as he tries to
win his seat back from US Representative John Tierney, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to bring it up,'' said Gene Hartigan,
Torkildsen's campaign manager. ``It's not germane to the campaign.
When asked, he certainly responds. It's just not part of the
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, state Senator Matthew J. Amorello, a
Massachusetts Republican, has freely criticized US Representative
Jim McGovern, a Democrat, for inviting Clinton to visit Worcester,
Mass. last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the president's actions were very disturbing, and I
would find it difficult to be on the stage given the circumstances
surrounding the whole sordid affair,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans such as Amorello are more likely to say the
voters are talking to them about Clinton's troubles, Democrats
insist that they hear very little about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, it rarely ever comes up, except by my political
opponent,'' McGovern said. ``When I'm in Worcester or Fall River or
Attleboro, people are asking me about education, about health care,
about the importance of protecting Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Tierney said he is sticking to a diet of issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``People keep talking to me about the things they sent me there
to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In New England, incumbent senators are less likely to be
affected by the turbulence in Washington. All three of the senators
up for reelection are considered secure: Vermont Democrat Patrick
J. Leahy, Connecticut Democrat Christopher J. Dodd, and New
Hampshire Republican Judd Gregg.
</P>
<P>
   US House incumbents in Rhode Island, Maine, and Vermont are also
considered safe. And among the five governor's seats in play, only
two are thought to be seriously competitive: Massachusetts Acting
Governor Paul Cellucci, a Republican, and Rhode Island Governor
Lincoln Almond, also a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic pollster John W. Gorman said he's not so sure the
scandal won't backfire on Republicans who try to use it for
political gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has perverse effects,'' he said, pointing to independent
voters who may be so turned off by talk of Clinton's problems that
they don't vote on Nov. 3. He also said voters could worry that if
Clinton is on his way out of office, Republicans will have too much
power, and voters might get behind local Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, this is not chess for a political point of view _
if I move there, you have to move there,'' Gorman said. ``Right
now, it's a really strange game of chance.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a game of chance that not all candidates are willing
to play. In Massachusetts, Cellucci is quick to point out that he
has not called for Clinton's impeachment or resignation. When he is
asked to comment on the president's behavior, Cellucci quotes his
opponent, Democrat Scott Harshbarger, or tries to appear as neutral
as possible to avoid offending potential supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are more interested in what my vision is of
keeping us moving forward and what Scott Harshbarger's vision is,''
he said.

HOW DID STARR BECOME THE MAN OF MY DREAMS?
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   I had an erotic dream about Ken Starr. Imagine my surprise.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't wake up screaming. In fact, I didn't remember the dream
until late the next day, when I was sitting at my desk leafing
through a magazine and came upon his picture. ``Oh no,'' I said out
loud, to myself, because there was nobody else around. But, oh yes,
it was true. As I sat there staring at his smooth, shiny, smiling,
self-satisfied face, the dream came back to me in all its revolting
detail.
</P>
<P>
   I have never had a waking thought about Starr that was even
remotely sexual, although I suppose, given what he's been up to,
the subject of sex and Starr are firmly welded in the public
imagination, mine included. But he's not exactly a sex symbol, is
he? More like an anti-sex symbol. So what was my dream about? Does
my unconscious find him attractive? An appalling thought. Of
course, it's possible that Starr would be just as disgusted to
learn that a total stranger in Boston had an erotic dream about him
as I was to have had the dream. Although maybe not, given his
public preoccupation with matters sexual.
</P>
<P>
   You can't choose who you have erotic dreams about,
unfortunately. It's not the first time I've had this sort of dream
about someone I find unattractive, even repulsive, when I'm awake.
A lot of people have similar dreams. You may be recalling one at
this very minute. If so, I'm sorry to have triggered a bad memory.
If it's any comfort, your dream probably means something other than
what it seems, just as my dream about Starr is about something
other than sex. At least I hope it's about something other than
sex. It had better be.
</P>
<P>
   I learned a lot about my dreams during five years in
psychoanalysis. The first year or so was pretty much a dead loss. I
would go to the analyst's office three times a week, lie down on
the couch, stare at the ceiling, and say, ``I can't do this.'' What
I couldn't do was free-associate, pour out my emotions and ideas
without thinking about what I was saying, what it might mean.
</P>
<P>
   At my analyst's suggestion I began keeping track of my dreams. I
would try to remember and record them so that I could talk about
them during our meetings. After I'd been doing this for a while,
things picked up, if things can ever be said to really ``pick up''
in psychoanalysis. In any case, my dreams enabled me to
free-associate and complete what I guess was a successful analysis,
or maybe only semi-successful, since I'm not really sure if it
worked totally. But that's another story.
</P>
<P>
   My dreams were seldom what they seemed. Some were easy to figure
out, like the recurring dream that I was driving a car backward
very fast and and the brakes didn't work. Some were a mystery,
among them a disturbingly erotic dream about Wade Boggs, who at the
time was throwing himself on the public's mercy, saying he was a
sex addict, a new concept back then. I didn't find Boggs attractive
when I was awake. In my dream he was irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for insight into the Starr dream, I picked up a book by
Joan Mazza, ``Dreaming Your Real Self,'' which has a chapter titled
``Sexual and Erotic Dreams.'' Under a subhead, ``Strangers and
Unrecognizable Partners,'' there were some suggestions on how to
interpret dreams about having sex with people we'd never be
attracted to in real life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this is an aspect of our sexuality that we have not
allowed ourselves to recognize,'' Mazza suggests.
</P>
<P>
   That might explain Boggs, but not Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps there is something about this person we admire and
would like to emulate, and so we incorporate him or her, using
sexual imagery as a metaphor,'' she continues.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or maybe it's the opposite and you are saying, `Screw him!'''
</P>
<P>
   That's more like it.

REJECTION OF KERRY DEAL PUTS IMPEACHMENT DRIVE INTO FOCUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like one other senator _ Joe Lieberman of Connecticut _ Senator
John Kerry has given the country a morsel of a precious commodity
sorely lacking around here: leadership.
</P>
<P>
   And like Lieberman, Kerry has helped clarify a situation in a
way that is hardly ideal for either President Clinton or his most
partisan enemies, but has already proved more than helpful for the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry is no broker and doesn't seek to be one. Instead, he seeks
to be a catalyst for both his colleagues and the president. So far,
Clinton has understood his message; Kerry's House and Senate
colleagues have not.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to view in tandem the Lieberman and Kerry
contributions to the dilemma the president created and Independent
Counsel Ken Starr exacerbated.
</P>
<P>
   In the immediate aftermath of last month's angry presidential
speech to the nation following his testimony to Starr's grand jury,
Lieberman put up a large stop sign on the Senate floor. By
insisting that Clinton's fooling around with Monica Lewinsky was
not simply private behavior but a legitimate public issue and
immoral to boot, Lieberman halted the president's initial attempts
to slide past his abbreviated confession with claims of privacy and
pressing public business.
</P>
<P>
   As a longtime associate going way back to his Yale Law School
days, the president got the message. At first haltingly and then
clear as a bell, Clinton responded and offered both literal
confession of sin and apology, which most of the country saw as
genuine precisely because of their awkwardness.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's contribution has been more complicated _ a way to help
both people and politicians (an unfortunately necessary
distinction) puzzle through the question of what should happen.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the extraordinary release of the president's
videotaped grand jury testimony, Kerry was urging still more
communication with Congress and the country _ primarily through a
Clinton appearance before the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He was urging that, however, only in the context of an agreement
between the leadership of the two parties in each house of Congress
on what he called a ``dignified and truncated'' process of
judgment. Kerry didn't necessarily mean censure or censure-plus,
and he didn't necessarily mean impeachment. Most important, what he
did mean was an agreement about how to proceed in a ``fixed,
certain'' manner that includes a quick judgment about what is an
impeachable offense, some stipulations about the facts in the case
and limits on any further investigation of them, and a ``clear and
certain ending.''
</P>
<P>
   As a one-time prosecutor, Kerry can convincingly cut through the
jibberish that helps drag this mess out to the country's frustrated
fury. ``I don't think it's that huge,'' he said last week. ``In
fact, on one issue of perjury it's a question of whether one
additional portion of the body was touched over another. I mean, is
that huge?
</P>
<P>
   ``Her (Monica Lewinsky's) testimony is one thing. His testimony
is another. And Congress already has on record the fundamentals of
both of those testimonies. Now, if you can tell me that months more
of investigation and hearings will shed more light on something
that only two people shared I'd be interested to know how.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leadership declined to respond. In the process,
however, its refusal put the political essence of its current
posture in much sharper focus.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of allowing a bipartisan agreement in detail on how to
proceed _ which with the right wink could have been negotiated in
no time _ the Gingrich-Lott leadership went purely political:
document dumps, no clear schedule or procedures, and a purely
partisan authorization of a formal inquiry. In short, the idea is
to stretch the entire process out past the November elections in
the hope of a Republican landslide fueled by the voting intensity
of hardcore GOP Clinton-haters.
</P>
<P>
   The president responded differently, encouraging Kerry both
before and after he made his suggestions, well aware that Kerry is
asking a great deal of him. After all, Kerry is not just seeking
the congressional appearance of bipartisan agreement on procedures
and timetables. Kerry also thinks Clinton, in addition to being a
hyperactive president during the final month of this do-little
Congress, should hold a televised town meeting on his conduct as
well as a no-holds-barred, no-time-limit press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hadn't agreed to anything. In fact, my understanding is
that he was somewhat hung up on an unrealistic desire to know
precisely what would be the upside to a favorable response to
Kerry. His reciprocal reaching out, however, stood in stark
contrast to the Republican rejection, and in this period, don't
forget, the GOP Congress's reputation in the polls slipped
noticeably and Clinton's recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the realist, Kerry understands his ideas are not
``operational'' right now, but he is right that they remain alive.
His real point has been that there is a mature way through all this
that can help a consensus to form. Kerry spoke for a great many
Americans, and what he said will hang around to rebuke what will
actually happen.

A JOB IS A JOB, RIGHT? WRONG! IT'S THE PAY THAT COUNTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT JORDAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's job growth _ and then there's real job growth.
</P>
<P>
   When Acting Governor Paul Cellucci campaigns on the huge growth
of jobs and the very low unemployment rate in Massachusetts over
the last eight years, he may be leaving out a few important
details.
</P>
<P>
   True, his administration and that of his predecessor, William F.
Weld, have been credited with creating much of the state's economic
good fortune, including what may be the lowest unemployment rate in
Massachusetts history. Cellucci often points this out.
</P>
<P>
   But what is missing from that picture is talk about the types of
jobs created, and the fragile foundation on which the state's
economy stands. Those newer jobs simply do not measure up to the
jobs the state lost during that same period.
</P>
<P>
   According to information from the state's Department of
Employment and Training, jobs created in the last decade tend to be
more temporary, lower-paying, and with fewer benefits than most
jobs that left Massachusetts over that time.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1993 and 1996, for example, 22,590 new employees have
been added to payrolls across the state. However, these jobs paid,
on average, $21,000 a year in 1996, and come largely from temporary
employment services and job placement agencies. (There's a sad
irony in the fact that, in Massachusetts, as well as in the nation,
the fastest growing industry is temporary and placement services.)
</P>
<P>
   During that same period, the Bay State lost 8,325 jobs, with a
1996 average wage of $65,944, among computer and office equipment
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   While computer services, including data processing, added 20,134
new employees with an average wage of $62,000 to payrolls in
Massachusetts, the state lost a total of 28,231 jobs during that
same time _ including well-paying jobs in manufacturing and
defense. The average wage in those lost jobs was $43,416.
</P>
<P>
   Although part of the state's job growth in the 1990s includes
5,818 new employees in doctor's offices and medical clinics, where
the average wage was a comfortable $52,390 a year, and 8,338 new
employees among security brokers, who earn $78,952, those gains
were offset by thousands of new lower-paying jobs created.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that the 16,399 new employees in restaurants and bars
earned $11,611 on average, while the 11,484 new employees in home
health services brought in an average of $19,257 a year.
</P>
<P>
   And so the trend continues: Good jobs in manufacturing, banking,
and high tech disappear, only to be replaced with lower-paying,
temporary jobs that do not necessarily contribute to a stronger
economy.
</P>
<P>
   And as for the Weld-Cellucci claim of downsizing state
government, particularly through the onerous route of privatizing
state agencies, the figures from the state DET suggest otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1990, just before Weld took office, there were
approximately 102,000 state employees. Last April, that number was
the same; there has been no significant trimming of government over
that period.
</P>
<P>
   As some economists point out, one danger to the state's economy
_ one rarely talked about by the Cellucci _ is that our work force
is concentrated in too few industries. More than half the state's
work force is employed in only six areas _ retail nondurable goods,
health care, eating and drinking establishments, local school
districts, financial services, and state government.
</P>
<P>
   Having all our employment eggs in one basket can be dangerous.
When one area collapses _ the financial or mutual funds industry,
say _ it has a dramatic negative impact because there are fewer
other areas of economic strength to absorb the blow.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, beneath the surface of all the rhetoric about the
state's rosy economy is a reality that a candidate for governor,
especially the Republican incumbent, can ignore only at his own
peril. As some economic analysts suggest, if the nation's economy
falters, the Bay State's economy, with its shaky foundation, will
almost certainly crash.
</P>
<P>
   As the November election approaches, it is not too late for
voters to ask tough questions about the true state of the
Massachusetts economy. If Cellucci continues to give soft,
feel-good answers to these tough questions, then the state's
electorate will decide whether he has the strength and the will to
guide the state through even tougher challenges waiting for us in
the next millennium.

UNDERSTANDING THE RULES FOR IRAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I need to understand the rules regarding
distributions from IRAs. My wife will be 71 this month, and I
turned 70 this past July. I have three IRAs totaling $102,000, and
my wife has a $20,000 IRA and will receive a 401(k) distribution of
approximately $18,000 when she retires in January, which will be
rolled over into an IRA. Can you explain the requirements for
beginning to take distributions? I have read that distributions
must commence by April 1 of the year that follows the participant
reaching age 70 1/2. Is this correct? We are not sure whether my
wife should have begun to take distributions already. What are the
minimum amounts that can be withdrawn, and what is the frequency of
distributions required? Who initiates the withdrawals _ the
participant or the depository institutions?
</P>
<P>
   A.I., Chula Vista, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You have stated the regulation correctly. Since 1998 is the
year in which your wife reached age 70 1/2, you only need to take a
distribution by April 1 of next year.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a wrinkle in the regulations that might mean you'll
want to take the first distribution before the end of this year.
The rule is this: While your wife may delay her first withdrawal
until 1999, that would qualify as her distribution for tax year
1998. Then she will be required to take a another dis-tri-bution
during 1999, representing her min-imum required distribution for
that tax year. The effect is that you would end up with two
distributions from her IRA on your 1999 income tax return.
</P>
<P>
   If you take her 1998 distribution before the end of the year,
she will never have to report more than one distribution on a
single tax return. The same will go for you. You will reach age 70
1/2 early in 1999, and thus you could delay the initial withdrawal
until April 1 of the year 2000. But if you waited beyond Dec. 31,
1999, you would face two distributions the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of the minimum required distribution is based on the
life expectancy of the IRA owner, or the joint life expectancy of
the owner and beneficiary if that's the way it has been set up.
This is determined by tables available from the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if your wife were to take the minimum distribution
from a $20,000 IRA this year, and if you are the beneficiary, the
joint life expectancy on the table is 20.2 years. You divide the
value of all IRA accounts by the life expectancy figure, and the
result is the amount of the mandatory minimum withdrawal, or $990.
In subsequent years, as the joint life expectancy decreases, the
percentage of the account that must be withdrawn increases.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, while the depository institution may send you a
reminder that a distribution will be required, it's up to you to
initiate the process. This can be done by simply sending a letter
making the request, although if you call the institution, they
probably will be happy to send a form outlining the information
that must be included.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Apparently there are two kinds of CDs _ one that is insured
by FDIC and one that is not. The one that is not pays a higher
interest rate. What is your opinion of the one that is not insured
by FDIC, and does the higher interest rate justify this risk?
</P>
<P>
   E.F., Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The CDs you are referring to are usually called ``jumbo'' CDs
_ jumbo because the minimum deposit is $100,000. They do indeed pay
higher yields, although the difference is sometimes pretty small.
</P>
<P>
   For example, as of Sept. 20, the nation's highest CD rate for a
five-year traditional CD was 6.20 percent; the highest rate for a
jumbo CD was 6.26 percent. The national average for the two
categories was 5.10 percent for small-saver CDs and 5.24 percent
for jumbos. The spread between small-saver and jumbo CDs was a
little greater on shorter-term instruments, with the nation's
average for 90-day traditional CDs at 4.63 percent, compared with
4.99 percent for jumbos.
</P>
<P>
   It's not precisely true that the jumbos aren't federally insured
_ the catch is that they are insured only up to $100,000. Savers
who wish to garner the higher rate with only a minimal risk
sometimes adopt the strategy of buying jumbos, but buying only the
$100,000 minimum.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is that their principal is insured, but the accrued
interest is not. Given the general good health of the nation's
banks, I think the ``risk'' inherent in buying a $100,000 jumbo CD
is so small that it is easily outweighed by the higher rate.
</P>
<P>
   But if you had, for example, $300,000 to invest in a CD, taking
the trouble of finding three institutions with good jumbo rates is
worth the effort.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I are in our mid-40s, and she has $31,000
invested in the following IRA accounts: $5,400 in American Mutual
fund, $6,200 in Fundamental Investors fund, $9,000 in EuroPacific
Growth fund, and $10,300 in John Hancock Emerging Growth fund,
Class B. I am a commander in the Navy, with a little over two years
left until I retire and seek civilian employment. I have $3,500 in
the Hancock Emerging Growth fund. In addition, we have $17,000 in a
money market, and $24,600 in common stocks. We are looking to roll
over some or all of my wife's account, and are specifically looking
at Janus 20 as a good vehicle for the next 20 years. Any thoughts?
</P>
<P>
   J.S., San Diego
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I see no reason to make wholesale changes in your wife's IRA,
but I do question the heavy concentration in John Hancock Emerging
Growth fund _ made even heavier by the additional position in your
name.
</P>
<P>
   The amount in question here is too large for this sector,
representing only a whisker less than you have in the two large-cap
value funds (American Mutual and Fundamental Investors), which I
would regard as the core holdings of this portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   So without even looking at the particular funds, I would suggest
you build the core holding to at least 50 percent of the total. A
better balance, for example, might be to retain your two core
holdings, building them up to 50 percent of the portfolio. Then
trim to 25 percent each the small-cap and overseas positions.
</P>
<P>
   (An even better allocation, I think, would be to reduce the
latter two positions to 16 2/3 percent, adding a similar position
in a good health care fund. A ``good'' health care fund, in my
opinion, is one focusing on pharmaceutical and medical equipment
issues and spurning the biotechs and health care delivery stocks.
Fidelity Select Health Care and Vanguard Specialized Health Care
are good examples.)
</P>
<P>
   Back to that IRA portfolio. An additional question is whether
John Hancock Emerging Growth is the best fund you could find within
the small-cap category.
</P>
<P>
   The small-cap growth fund sector is one that has had a tough
time for the past decade, and especially during the past three
years. But there are certainly a number of funds that have fared
better than yours.
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar Mutual Funds rates the Hancock offering below
average, and rates it high for risk. Since its last full report on
the category, in late April, Morningstar has reduced the ratings of
all three formerly above-average funds (Baron Asset, Baron Growth
and Income, and Kaufmann), so there are no offerings in the group
rated better than average.
</P>
<P>
   I'd be happier if you looked to the value end of the small-cap
sector, where you'll fund Longleaf Partners Small-Cap and Weitz
Hickory funds winning top Morningstar ratings, and Barr Rosenberg
U.S. Small Cap, FAM Value, Fidelity Low-Priced Stock, Franklin
Balance Sheet Investment, PIMCo Micro Cap Growth, Royce Total
Return, Skyline Special Equities, UAM ICM Small Company, and
Wachovia Special Values funds all rated above-average.
</P>
<P>
   As for Janus 20, I'm going to ignore its spectacular record and
suggest caution. This is partially because with its concentrated
portfolio of 28 stocks (as of Morningstar's Aug. 6 report) it
stands a better-than-average chance of stumbling hard if the market
heads south.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the portfolio is not only concentrated, but it's
expensive _ sporting an average portfolio price-to-earnings ratio
of 49.2 at the time of the Morningstar report. This would probably
be a great fund choice at the beginning of a bull market, but our
current beast seems to me to be pretty tired out, so I suggest you
pass on this fund for now.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Every weekday morning, Victor Galvani swallows his blood
pressure and cholesterol pills with breakfast (coffee and a muffin
or whole-wheat toast, no butter) and heads to his law office, just
as he has for 61 years.
</P>
<P>
   The 84-year-old attorney is both a participant and beneficiary
of the venerable Framingham Heart Study, which celebrates its 50th
birthday this week.
</P>
<P>
   So is his wife, Louise, 74, a study participant whose parents
were also among the study's original 5,209 enrollees (one-third of
whom survive). Their son Paul, 45, signed up with the Framingham
offspring study in 1971. If plans for a third-generation study go
forward, the Galvani grandchildren will continue the tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Each time the Galvanis reported for their biennial Framingham
Study exams, researchers collected 700 separate items of data,
accumulating about 17,500 items on each subject over the life of
the study, says Ralph D'Agostino, a Boston University mathematician
who leads the study's statistical analysis.
</P>
<P>
   This trove of long-term data on a single population is unique in
the world, far outstripping in value the relatively paltry $43
million it has cost American taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Framingham Study that provided some of the first
evidence that high cholesterol is an important marker for heart
disease risk. That touched off a long-running debate about the
benefits of cholesterol-lowering that large studies have only
recently resolved, vindicating the Framingham researchers'
contentions.
</P>
<P>
   Other landmark Framingham findings: high blood pressure
increases the risk of heart attack as well as stroke; smoking
cigarettes sharply raises the risk of heart disease; women's
estrogen levels protect them against heart disease until menopause;
exercise and obesity are opposite sides of the same risk coin. The
list goes on and on.
</P>
<P>
   As the study population has aged, the project has sprouted
offshoots on a range of other diseases of aging _ dementia, vision
and hearing loss, arthritis, and osteoporosis, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   All this may be prologue, some believe, to the most
revolutionary Framingham findings of all: illuminating the genetic
basis of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Framingham pioneer Dr. William Castelli, the study's director
from 1975 to 1995, has long pointed out that known risk factors
cannot entirely explain who gets heart disease and who is spared.
Twenty-seven percent of Framingham heart attacks occur in a person
with low cholesterol, but some individuals with high cholesterol
don't have bad hearts. Dietary salt drives some people's blood
pressure up, but not everyone's.
</P>
<P>
   To unravel these riddles, scientists are identifying 400 markers
on the genes of Framingham Study participants that will be linked
to traits that put individuals at risk or protect them.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is to provide doctors and patients with precise risk
profiles that not only forewarn but indicate what they need to do
to minimize genetic risk factors. The information will undoubtedly
lead to precise new therapies aimed at countering inborn traits.

MOORE GETS ON WITH LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GAIL CALDWELL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
BIRDS OF AMERICA 
By Lorrie Moore. Knopf. 
287 pp. $23. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best comic writers have death in one corner of their vision
and love in the other; they are rarely funny at the expense of
being wise. Lorrie Moore has been admired for more than a decade
for her mordant wit, her stunningly precise irony that could do a
little cliff walk between bravery and despair. A member of the
post-Watergate, post-Raymond Carver writers' cadre that redefined
the contemporary short story, Moore is better than most of her
peers, in part because her characters _ their pitch-perfect
dialogue, their wacky self-doubts _ actually sound like people you
know. She has infused the cultural truths of modern America into
the inner lives of her fiction, and this empathy _ this dazzling,
bittersweet realism _ has the surprising effect of imbuing her work
with a kind of wild and lasting hope. If stories were people,
Moore's would be interesting oddballs sitting in the park wearing
funny hats, playing chess to the strains of Mozart or rock 'n'
roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Birds of America'' is a marvelous collection, deeper than
anything Moore has written and yet still underscored by that
trademark humor in the face of familiar awfulness. The stories are
tough, lean, funny, and metaphysical; death and the fear of death
are all over the place, executing a ghostly dance, weaving on the
periphery, in the fog. Edgy and mildly haunted, Moore's characters
have learned to live with their disappointments, but part of their
identity is their alienation: their continual bumping up against
the American dream. The women tend to be arty misfits, painters or
dancers or literary types; one heavy reader, having been frightened
out of her wits in English Lit by Derrida and Lacan, became a
librarian instead. In ``Willing,'' a second-rate actress bails out
of Hollywood and takes refuge in a Days Inn in Chicago, afraid that
she has done everything wrong. ``She hadn't been given the proper
tools to make a real life with, she decided, that was it. She'd
been given a can of gravy and a hairbrush, and told, `There you
go.' She'd stood there for years, blinking and befuddled, brushing
the can with the brush.''
</P>
<P>
   The alacrity of such images is darng and sometimes explosive; I
wrote ``oh!'' so many times in the margins of these pages that it
became my one-word synopsis of the book. Blending absurdity and
sorrow, the agonies and pratfalls that await even the most casual
of lives, Moore has her characters fighting the good fight partly
out of habit; she knows that courage itself, a fine thing on paper,
is a slapdash affair, ``a construction of wish and string and
distance.'' In ``Which Is More Than I Can Say about Some People,''
a woman travels to Ireland with her formidable mother to kiss the
Blarney stone; what is supposed to be a spiritual (or at least
memorable) experience quickly becomes alarming and mildly tawdry.
Only when the mother's fears are stripped bare does her daughter
see beyond her maternal failures to the connective tissue that has
held them all these years.
</P>
<P>
   An inveterate punster, Moore has a tendency to be clever at her
own expense; the best work in her first collection, ``Self-Help,''
were those stories that averted over-the-top humor for a darker,
more certain viewpoint. She rarely goes for cheap laughs in these
stories; when she does, she has the good sense to blame it on her
characters. ``Birds of America'' calls to mind more than one
predecessor; with its cocksure, drier-than-brushfire women, the
narrative often reminded me of the midcentury stories of Mary
McCarthy and Tess Slesinger. But its more important aesthetic
legacy is to Carver's ``Cathedral,'' though not for the usual
reasons of comparison. It's the sense of epiphany that skirts the
edges of these stories. Like Carver's blind man and his reluctant
student in the title story of ``Cathedral,'' the woman and her
young partner in ``Dance in America'' bend and tuck their way into
a holy moment.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of life is rarely so pretty: divorce (one man has taken
to videotaping his vows and his divorce proceedings), half-hearted
liaisons (meant to stave off loneliness or mortality, but rarely
successful), family reunions that pretend to be Not Awful. Even the
promises of the good life are wickedly conceived. The home
renovation in ``Real Estate,'' staged as a last-gasp effort to save
a dying marriage, unearths raccoons, squirrels, a bat brigade,
vulturous crows, and a gang of teenage hoodlum-squatters. In
``Terrific Mother,'' which is, among other things, a sendup of
academic think tanks in the Italian Alps, a group of scholars and
their neglected (mostly female) spouses gather at dinner to trade
tropes; the protagonist, a spouse and sort-of artist, takes to
killing spiders in her studio, then sketching their corpses.
</P>
<P>
   The last three stories _ ``Real Estate,'' ``People Like That Are
the Only People Here,'' and ``Terrific Mother'' _ are what take
``Birds of America'' from the realm of good, solid collections into
the extraordinary. Here, Moore's signature laughter in the face of
anguish has more than met its match. The renovation nightmare of
``Real Estate'' not only excavates a grave's worth of memories and
disrepair, it also serves as a stage for a dying woman's last stand
against the random cruelties of life. The woman in ``Terrific
Mother,'' accompanying her economist husband to that Italian villa,
is fleeing the memory of a freak accident that killed a child. But
the piece de resistance is ``People Like That,'' which opens with
its third-person protagonist (``the Mother'') finding blood in her
baby's diaper. So begins a wrenching account of a couple's journey
through the hell of pediatric oncology, their infant son having
been diagnosed with cancer. ``You'll get through it,'' the surgeon
tells the mother.
</P>
<P>
   ```How?' asks the Mother. `How does one get through it?'
</P>
<P>
   ```You just put your head down and go.'''
</P>
<P>
   Drawn from similar circumstances in Moore's own life, ``People
Like That'' has already become something of a classic since it was
published in The New Yorker in 1997; in capturing one of the worst
ordeals of human experience, the story is agonizing to read and yet
breathtaking in its force. In part because Moore has always worn
her wit like a lead-lined overcoat, her use of it here feels
particularly heroic; so, too, when it no longer serves her. When
all the irony in the world won't help _ when she is left in the
room with her sleeping son and her fear _ her prose bears the
weight and endurance of stone.
</P>
<P>
   For all its sense of fragmentation, of fallen stars or dreams in
disrepair, ``Birds of America'' has about it a wild beauty that
simply makes one feel more connected to life. So: Oh!

A PROVOCATIVE HISTORY OF HUMAN BLOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
BLOOD 
An Epic History of Medicine and Commerce 
By Douglas Starr. Knopf. 441 pp. Illustrated. $27.50. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Denizens of developed nations who need heart surgery, a liver
transplant, or medical rescue from a traumatic auto accident can
almost always count on one thing: plenty of lifesaving blood of the
right type, untainted these days by disease-causing organisms.
</P>
<P>
   What an achievement this is, and how recent!
</P>
<P>
   Early in this century, transfusion was so new that only a few
hundred among the millions of World War I casualties got one. Blood
wasn't even banked until World War II; before that, doctors had to
scramble for ``donors on the hoof'' when the need arose. (In the
1940s, the Germans had to designate soldiers _ Aryans, of course _
to follow the war action and stand ready to bleed for fallen
comrades. Wartime Japanese blood technology was equally primitive.)
</P>
<P>
   The splitting of blood into its component parts is another
advance within living memory. That led to a steady procession of
advances: the freeze-drying of plasma, which could be shipped long
distances and reconstituted to counteract traumatic shock, an
enormous strategic advantage during the Second World War; then the
isolation of albumin, a sponge-like protein that was even better
for expanding circulatory volume in cases of severe blood loss;
ultimately the availability of a cornucopia of components that have
saved and transformed lives for millions _ clotting factors for
hemophiliacs, gamma globulins to fight infections, packed and
frozen red cells as an efficient alternative to more perishable
whole blood, white cells and platelets for depleted cancer
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Boston University journalism professor Douglas Starr skillfully
marshals these and other landmarks in the history of blood as an
antidote to our complacency about what he calls this ``most human
commodity.'' ``Blood: An Epic History of Medicine and Commerce''
has sweep and illuminating narrative, much of it not widely known
nor remembered _ such as the central role of blood profiteers in
the downfall of the avaricious Somosa regime in Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Blood'' is more than historical narrative. Starr also
provokes a good deal of thought about the mismanagement of this
``precious and dangerous medicine.'' This is a tale of our own era,
tragic and disturbing even if Starr doesn't quite manage to
persuade this reviewer of his central thesis: That voluntary blood
donation is not, in the end, inherently better than paid-for blood.
</P>
<P>
   Blood is a rich and resonant subject. What other substance is so
freighted with ancient significance or cultural baggage? The
Egyptians sometimes bathed in blood to absorb its vital essence. To
Greeks it was one of the four humors that must be kept in balance
to ensure health. In Christian communion it is an expression of
oneness with Christ and a covenant of everlasting life.
</P>
<P>
   Think too of vampires, of blood oaths, of blood as the symbol of
tribal or racial difference _ a line of thought that leads to Nazi
insistence on keeping Aryan blood pure and to the segregation of
American blood supplies by race, a practice that persisted in some
states until the late 1960s, with Red Cross sanction.
</P>
<P>
   Starr does justice to this bloody history, starting with the
repellent and curiously persistent 2,500-year-old practice of
bloodletting. Did you know that ``leech'' comes from the
Anglo-Saxon loece, which meant ``to heal''? Or that the Father of
Our Country himself was done in by the practice, which persisted in
rural US areas into the 1920s?
</P>
<P>
   Transfusing blood, of course, rather than letting it drain away,
was the great innovation, even if it began in a misguided
17th-century attempt to cure insanity by infusing patients with
blood from a placid animal. It took the better part of three
centuries to discover transfusion's proper medical uses and make it
practical.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's historical narrative bears his reader into the main
current of this book, the sorry politics of blood during the past
50 years, when science transformed the substance into an item of
global commerce of rare value and power _ then discovered it could
also be a vehicle of deadly menace.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the commercial value of blood. A 42-gallon barrel of
crude oil sells for about $20, while the equivalent amount of whole
blood is worth around $20,000. Refined into components, that
hypothetical barrel of blood would yield $67,000.
</P>
<P>
   Petroleum is pumped from dead rock strata, but blood must come
from the veins of consenting humans, and that's the rub. How to
obtain blood _ whether donors should be paid for it or be persuaded
to give freely _ has been the central problem in the transfusion
enterprise since it began to find a place in medicine nearly a
century ago.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has never been solved, and perhaps never will be.
Starr's rigorous review of both types of blood systems _ commercial
and charitable _ demonstrates that both have failed monumentally,
in terms of both diligence and ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Paying donors, a practice that seemed indispensable as the
global demand for plasma and its constituents soared, has led blood
entrepreneurs to exploit the poorest, most desperate, and most
likely to be diseased. Starr's thorough profile of the commercial
blood business, from America's Skid Rows to Central American
barrios and South Africa's black townships, is ample indictment of
an enterprise often marked by disregard for the humanity and
welfare of both donors and recipients. Years before the AIDS virus
began to taint blood and plasma, transfusion-associated hepatitis
raised a warning: Paid blood was at least 10 times more likely to
transmit the hepatitis virus.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr leaves us with no illusions about the voluntary-blood
sector, here and abroad. Beneath the veneer of altruism often lay
rancorous self-interest and ruinous competition.
</P>
<P>
   More disturbing, when the AIDS virus began to contaminate the
blood supply, the nonprofits acted no more honorably than their
commercial brethren. Starr quotes a tellingly cynical internal memo
written by an American Red Cross representative after the US
Centers for Disease Control held a meeting in early 1983 to lay out
the evidence and plead with blood collectors to start screening
donors for behavioral risk factors or hepatitis B markers, as a
surrogate for AIDS exposure. (The AIDS virus had not yet been
discovered, and there was no test for it until 1985.) Dismissing
agency scientists' pleas, the Red Cross official wrote his
superiors: ``It has long been noted that CDC increasingly needs a
major epidemic to justify its existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Denial and foot-dragging continued for years among government
officials, commercial blood suppliers, and nonprofit agencies,
while AIDS inexorably infected most of the world's hemophiliacs and
thousands of unfortunate transfusion recipients. Even after
scientists developed the AIDS blood test and a method to kill the
virus in the clotting factor on which hemophiliacs depended, blood
banks distributed contaminated lots to unsuspecting patients rather
than discard inventories.
</P>
<P>
   Starr shows that nonprofit blood agencies have no inherent claim
to moral superiority. And he has a point when he notes that the
French tradition of benevolat _ selfless voluntary blood donation _
fed their refusal to believe their blood supply could be
contaminated until the late 1980s, when two top blood-collection
officials were jailed for knowingly distributing AIDS
virus-contaminated products to hemophiliacs.
</P>
<P>
   ``No system is immune from mistakes,'' Starr writes. ``Safety is
a matter of practice, not ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly true. But the balance of his own evidence
nonetheless weighs in favor of voluntary donation, it seems to me.
Despite the political squabbles, abuses, and outrages he documents
among nonprofit agencies, the incentives under which they operate
are different, and do matter.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to suggestions for holding both types of blood
collection systems more accountable (for we probably will continue
to depend on both), what is missing from Starr's incisive overview
is a discussion of how, or whether, we might inculcate the
charitable ethic among the 95 percent of Americans who never bother
to give blood.

HOW DOES THE SUN APPEAR TO BE BURNING IN SPACE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. If there is no oxygen in space, then how do the sun and other
stars burn with apparent flames?
</P>
<P>
   R.C. Jr., Goodyear, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. As hot as the sun may be making you in Arizona, it's not
really burning at all. It's fusing.
</P>
<P>
   Burning is a chemical reaction that involves the electrons in
the outer shells of atoms in the fuel. Oxygen is part of what's
necessary for the chemical reaction. But the sun and other stars
create their energy by fusing the nuclei at the center of hydrogen
atoms. The single-proton nuclei from each of four hydrogen atoms
fuse into a single nucleus of helium that has two protons and two
neutrons. But the helium nucleus winds up with a smaller mass than
the sum of those four hydrogen nuclei that fused together.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is energy. Lots of energy.
</P>
<P>
   Einstein's famous equation E(EQ)mc &UR; gfsu &LR; 2 translates to: energy
equals mass times the speed of light squared. Well, the mass lost
in fusing that tiny helium nucleus isn't very much at all. But the
speed of light is 186,000 miles per second. Squared, that's
34,596,000,000. Multiply that times even the tiniest value for
mass, and you've got lots of energy.
</P>
<P>
   Fusion creates one million times more energy, per atom, than
chemical burning. Who needs oxygen when you've got that kind of
power available!
</P>
<P>
   We can create the staggering power of the sun here on Earth, in
the form of a hydrogen fusion bomb. But finding a way to use an
on-going, self-sustaining nuclear fusion reaction for a
controllable energy source has engineers stumped. Since
temperatures reach five million degrees at the center of the sun,
standard materials can't be used to build a container to hold such
a reaction. Scientists have built machines called Tokamaks that use
magnetic fields to do the job, but they haven't been able to hold
the fuel long enough to reach ignition, the point at which the
reaction becomes self-sustaining. That's what the sun does with
fusion, and what nuclear power plants do with fission reactions,
which split nuclei apart instead of fusing them together.

THE HITS KEEP COMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You watch a 230-pound NFL quarterback take a vicious sack and
you wince. He struggles to his feet, shaking his head, trying to
clear the cobwebs. Perhaps he needs to be helped to the sidelines,
where a trainer holds up his fingers and asks ``How many?'' The TV
cameras capture it all.
</P>
<P>
   What you probably don't see and seldom think about is the
330-pound guard, smashing himself into a 340-pound tackle who's
hurtling at him. Forty times a game. Sixteen games a season. Fifty
times a week in practice. Fifty times a day in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   That's 2,530 pounding collisions a season, crunching a spine
that, likely as not, will protest sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a 10-year career, figure it out,'' challenges Dr. Warren
King, team physician for the Oakland Raiders. ``Lineman is the one
position on the field that makes contact with another player all
the time, and often contact with multiple players.''
</P>
<P>
   Tack on four years of college, four years of high school and a
couple of Pop Warner seasons and the number of hits is staggering:
well upwards of 100,000. And as linemen get bigger _ there were 279
players on the NFL rosters last week who weighed at least 300
pounds _ the impact is only getting greater.
</P>
<P>
   Even before they get out of college, one study reports, up to 50
percent of football players report lower back pain, and the
majority of them are the guys in the trenches. In another study,
almost 50 percent of down linemen _ who start each play from the
familiar three-point stance _ X-rayed at an NFL tryout camp showed
evidence of accelerated wear and tear to the lower spine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the occupational hazard of playing football,'' said Dr.
Kevin P. Speer, associate professor of orthopedic surgery at Duke
University and physician for its varsity teams. ``You're taking
very large men who are very strong and having them hit each other
as hard as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the straight-on impact of a football block
doesn't produce much more force on the lower spine than a powerful
golf swing or sweep of an oar, and the force is almost identical to
that of a squat lift in weightlifting. Football has not, by any
means, cornered the market on back problems, as golfers, rowers and
lifters will attest. But the lineman's lumbar spine is at special
risk, probably because of the way he must drive upward and rapidly
change direction at the time of collision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the incidence of stress fractures is much higher in
offensive linemen than it is in the general population,'' says Dr.
Charles Gatt, a sports medicine orthopedic surgeon at Robert Wood
Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, N.J. What Gatt found
in his study, using five college football linemen attacking
blocking sleds, is that the repetition of the mechanics of blocking
may be the reason linemen suffer more back problems than players at
other positions. ``Forces are high, but not high enough to cause a
single traumatic injury,'' said Gatt.
</P>
<P>
   So the question becomes, if the damage is compounded by overuse,
how do you cut down on that without sacrificing the quality of
play?
</P>
<P>
   For starters, linemen try to reduce their weight for the
offseason, says King, a member of the Association of Professional
Team Physicians. And increasingly, they stay in better shape
year-round, so they come to training camp each year with a better
baseline of fitness.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most importantly, ``Most teams (at the pro level)
nowadays don't do any significant tackling in practice,'' he said.
``Before, they used to hit a lot more than they do now.''
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing technique rather than impact during practice, along
with proper weight lifting techniques to strengthen muscles in the
lower back, seem to be two keys to reducing wear and tear. But the
college coach with the second-best lifetime record in history goes
even further.
</P>
<P>
   ``We eliminate whatever we think is not necessary to win, and I
think most everything is unnecessary,'' said John Gagliardi, coach
at Saint John's University in Collegeville, Minn. ``The more you're
out there (on the practice field), the more you're apt to get
injured.''
</P>
<P>
   So Gagliardi, whose teams were 342-104-11 coming into this
season, is wary of too much contact in practice. No blocking sleds.
No rough stuff. No calisthenics, even. And very few injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd better win with that style,'' said Gagliardi, in his
50th year of coaching. ``Otherwise, they'll think you're nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gagliardi is well aware that what flies at a smaller,
Division 3 program such as Saint John's won't necessarily work
elsewhere, especially where the stakes are higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of what they do,'' says King of professional
athletes. ``They give up some of their health in order to make
money playing.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just the money. When Speer, the Duke team physican,
warns linemen of the possibility of degenerative spine problems and
pain later in life, they don't exactly shrug, but they don't quit,
either.
</P>
<P>
   He certainly didn't. ``The game of football has so many
stresses, after a time a price has to be paid,'' says Speer,
himself a former lineman who does exercises and stretches every day
to keep his back from misbehaving. ``Would I otherwise, at 39, have
to do the stretches? Maybe, maybe not. If I had to do it all over
again, I'd play football in a heartbeat.''

ARE THE WORLD'S OCEANS UNDER THIN ICE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ORONO, Maine _ When the two-mile-thick layers of ice that had
blanketed much of the northern hemisphere melted away at the end of
the last Ice Age, only one major sheet of potentially unstable ice
remained on the planet. It's called the West Antarctic Ice Sheet,
and it's still there today.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe not for long.
</P>
<P>
   According to some specialists, the entire sheet could melt away
in as little as a few centuries, inundating the world's coastlines
with a 20-foot rise in sea level. It could be the single greatest
potential hazard from global warming, and perhaps the greatest
Earth-based danger humanity faces. To try to figure out just how
likely this devastating scenario really is, a variety of intensive
research projects is now underway.
</P>
<P>
   The world has been bouncing back and forth for at least 2
million years between long ice ages and shorter ``interglacial''
periods. The present interglacial began about 10,000 years ago, but
the process of ``deglaciation,'' or melting of ice sheets, may not
be quite complete. Most scientists think it's clear that during at
least some past interglacials, the West Antarctic ice vanished
completely.
</P>
<P>
   But will it happen this time around? One way to answer that
question is to try to figure out whether the sheet always melted
away during past interglacials, or whether it sometimes survived
the warm period. A drilling project just getting underway, with the
start of the Antarctic ``summer'' season last week, is looking for
evidence that might answer that question.
</P>
<P>
   When the last Ice Age ended, after much of the northern
hemisphere (including all of New England) had been buried under ice
for 100,000 years, worldwide sea level rose about 300 feet over a
period of a millenium or two. The level has continued to rise at a
much slower rate, and global warming caused by human-generated
``greenhouse gases'' is expected to raise sea level another two
feet or so over the next century.
</P>
<P>
   But that predicted rise ignores the effect of the West Antarctic
ice. If that huge mass, about the size of Mexico, were to melt
rapidly, it could double or triple the rate of expected sea &UR;  &LR; level
rise, perhaps adding 20 feet to the rise within a few centuries.
That's enough to drown portions of Boston and Cape Cod and much of
Florida, and to wipe some island nations off the face of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The reason the West Antarctic ice sheet is so unstable, in
contrast to the even larger East Antarctic ice, is because it lies
on bedrock that is, on average, about 1,000 feet below sea level.
Some is ``grounded'' on the bedrock below, but tongues of floating
ice, called ice shelves, extend from this sheet in many places,
often reaching hundreds of miles out to sea. These sheets grow
outward because of the flow of ice from the inland regions where
snow accumulates, and icebergs constantly ``calve'' off from their
outer edges.
</P>
<P>
   ``As sea level rises, the grounding line'' _ the boundary
between the floating ice and that sitting on bedrock _ ``moves
inland, and sections of the ice can break off.'' That would raise
sea level more, causing further retreat of the grounding line, and
so on. ``If it starts to collapse, it could go in a galloping way.
It's kind of scary.''
</P>
<P>
   But some scientists think that rather than a rapid and
potentially catastrophic melting, it's more likely that even if the
ice sheet does melt away, it would happen so slowly that it would
have little impact.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bentley, a geophysicist at the University of Wisconsin
who has studied Antarctica since 1957, doubts that melting could be
rapid enough to be much of a problem. He says present evidence
indicates ``less and less of a sense of concern in terms of
anything that potentially would be a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Bindschadler of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Goddard Space Flight Center says it's clear from
evidence of past sea levels that ``we see very rapid rises do
occur.'' Those all seem to be caused by the collapse of major ice
sheets, such as one that extended over much of North America during
the Ice Age. ``The West Antarctic ice sheet is the last one like
that'' left on the planet, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A few scientists see an even more apocalyptic scenario: If the
West Antarctic sheet melts away, that could uncork a bottleneck and
trigger melting of the more stable East &UR;  &LR; Antactic ice, potentially
adding ten times as much water to the oceans.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, some scientists foresee the reverse effect:
Antarctic ice might actually grow as global temperatures rise,
because warmer air can carry more moisture and thus could increase
the rate of snowfall. The waxing ice sheet might even counteract
some of the sea's rise.
</P>
<P>
   In a review article earlier this year in the journal Nature,
Michael Oppenheimer of the Environmental Defense Fund concluded
that what is most likely is a melting that could increase sea level
rise by two to four feet per century, but probably not for another
100 years. But he said the reverse, with Antarctica reducing
sea &UR;  &LR; level rise, is still possible.
</P>
<P>
   Which prediction is right, or is the truth somewhere in between?
A weeklong conference at the University of Maine in Orono earlier
this month, organized by Borns and Bindschadler, brought together
specialists from around the world. The evidence at this point, most
agreed, remains ambiguous, but several ambitious new studies may
help to provide the answers soon.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as the six-month summer research season began in
Antarctica, a team of scientists funded by the National Science
Foundation began setting up equipment on a rise called Siple Dome
for a project to drill through the ice down to the bedrock below.
If they find fossil evidence showing that marine organisms were
living there during the last interglacial period, the last time the
world's climate was similar to today's, it would show that the ice
had completely melted away at that time.
</P>
<P>
   If so, that may mean its disappearance is normal in an
interglacial, and its melting is virtually inevitable this time
around. And even if the ice sheet didn't disappear last time, it's
possible global warming could cause it to do so this time.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of Earth's population lives within 200 feet of
sea level, so determining what's likely to happen to the Antarctic
ice, and how fast it could happen, is critically important.
Research in the region has been going on intensively for a decade,
but answers are still elusive _ partly because it's difficult to
distinguish between long-term trends and the natural ebb and flow
of ice.
</P>
<P>
   But there are already some very alarming signs: Several times in
the last decade, huge pieces of ice _ some bigger than Rhode Island
_ have broken off the ice shelves; and evidence from the seafloor
shows one large ice shelf disappeared entirely within the last few
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been an iceberg outburst over the last 10 to 12
years,'' said Terence Hughes, a geologist at the University of
Maine. The increased production of icebergs and the collapse of an
ice shelf in that period encompasses four different climatic zones
in Antarctica, he said. ``It makes you wonder if it's all
coincidence,'' he said, ``or an early warning of a long-term
disintegration of the West Antarctic ice sheet.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, he said, a report published in Science, based
on new satellite data, showed that the grounding line under one ice
shelf called Pine Island Glacier is retreating at the amazing rate
of about 3/4 of a mile per year. ``If it continued at that rate for
a century,'' Hughes said, ``that would be the end of the West
Antarctic ice sheet.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Alley, a glaciologist at Pennsylvania State University,
said ice cores in Greenland show that such changes can happen very
rapidly. At the end of the last Ice Age, he said, at least a third
of the total change in temperature took place over a span of just a
few decades.
</P>
<P>
   But, Alley said, the evidence from Antarctica itself is
ambiguous and confusing. ``It's changing very rapidly if you look
at small places,'' he said, ``but if you look at the whole ice
sheet, it isn't doing much.''
</P>
<P>
   Bentley contends that the evidence, if anything, seems to point
away from the likelihood of any rapid melting of ice. ``There
doesn't seem to be much talk about anything like that anymore,'' he
said last week. But, he added, even a much slower melting could
prove devastating in the long run for low-lying coastal regions and
island nations.

FRAMINGHAM HEART STUDY AT 50: PREVENTION NOW THE GOAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   During the half-century since researchers began to prod, bleed,
and query 5,209 Framingham, Mass. residents in a unique study on
the origins of heart disease, something remarkable happened. The
nation's cardiac death rates plummeted, thanks in no small measure
to the lessons of Framingham.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last 30 years, deaths from heart disease have
declined by over half, and from stroke by 60 percent,'' said Dr.
Daniel Levy, director of the Framingham Heart Study, which is
celebrating its 50th birthday this week. ``That's an extraordinary
event in the annals of medical history.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardiovascular deaths still claim the lives of more Americans
(nearly 890,000 a year) than the next five causes combined. But now
specialists are focusing on a different target: the troubling
incidence of nonfatal, first-time heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1987, heart attack incidence has stayed level or even
increased, even as cardiac deaths have declined, according to a
study in the current New England Journal of Medicine. The trend is
driving an effort by the federal government and private groups,
such as the American Heart Association and American College of
Cardiology, to get more US doctors and patients to act on the
messages from Framingham.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're falling short every time someone has a first heart
attack,'' said Dr. Richard Pasternak of Massachusetts General
Hospital, who participated in a Dallas workshop last week on the
issue. ``This is an entirely preventable disease. But in the big
picture, we can say that prevention is obviously failing.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Kannel, the Framingham Study's director between 1966
and 1979, agreed: ``The point has to come when we consider a heart
attack, a stroke, or heart failure as not the first indication of
disease but as a medical failure. I think we're pretty close.''
</P>
<P>
   The Framingham Study invented the very concept of cardiovascular
risk factors _ traits such as high blood cholesterol and behaviors
such as cigarette smoking _ associated with the development of
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Framingham has taught us the great lessons of preventive
medicine,'' said Dr. David Satcher, the US surgeon general. ``We
know that how we live today can directly impact upon how long we
will live tomorrow. We know without a doubt that consuming fatty
foods, living a sedentary life, and smoking all contribute to
cardiovascular disease.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not that heart disease prevention doesn't work.
The problem, specialists say, is that insights generated by the
Framingham Study and its successors about coronary risk factors are
not being systematically applied in doctors' offices every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole epidemic of untreated and suboptimally treated
patients with coronary risk factors,'' said Levy. ``We're now
adequately treating and controlling fewer than a fifth of people
with high cholesterol levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, specialists agree that high blood pressure, a potent
risk factor for both heart attacks and strokes, is under-recognized
and inadequately treated. Studies show that only about 25 percent
of Americans with high blood pressure have the condition adequately
controlled through diet and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, high blood pressure treatment has been slipping
recently. ``For about 20 years we have seen some very favorable
trends in the control of blood pressure,'' said Dr. Claude Lenfant,
director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. ``During
the last three or four years there has been a reversal in these
trends.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, specialists say, is that heart disease risk
factors have often been treated one at a time, both in public
health messages and in doctors' offices. But in reality, they work
in concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1960s we worked on smoking, in the '70s it was blood
pressure, in the '80s we stressed cholesterol, in the late '80s it
was HDL-cholesterol, and here we are in the '90s, trying to put it
all together,'' said Dr. Peter Wilson, a Framingham Study
researcher.
</P>
<P>
   Putting it all together, it turns out, is not easy. Wilson and
his colleagues are not the first to decide that doctors need an
easy-to-use way to predict patients' likelihood of developing heart
disease, one credible enough to use in counseling patients about
needed lifestyle changes and in making decisions about whether to
prescribe drugs. Other attempts to devise a cardiovascular risk
scorecard have met with criticism: too complicated, not
scientifically based, too reliant on expensive tests.
</P>
<P>
   With the advantage of the world's largest heart disease database
_ an estimated 117 million separate pieces of information on the
Framingham Study's original 5,209 participants and on 5,135
offspring enrolled in 1971 _ Wilson and his colleagues have devised
a simple-to-use scorecard they hope will gain wide use by US
physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Their scorecard uses a pared-down minimum of questions: age,
sex, blood pressure, total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol, smoking
status, and diabetes status.
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly, the Framingham scorecard does not include items on
obesity, physical activity, or family history of disease. ``These
factors work to a large extent through the major risk factors, and
their unique contribution to coronary heart disease prediction can
be difficult to quantify,'' the researchers wrote in the May
journal Circulation.
</P>
<P>
   The score that emerges from the Framingham risk assessment sheet
represents an individual's risk of having a heart attack (fatal or
nonfatal) or developing serious heart disease symptoms in the next
10 years. The score sheet gives comparisons for the average
person's risk at the same age level and _ since the average US risk
is too high to be considered a desirable goal _ the 10-year
likelihood of heart attack for a person with optimal contol of
coronary risk factors.
</P>
<P>
   Using the Framingham scorecard, a 55-year-old man who smokes and
has a cholesterol level of 250, an HDL or ``good cholesterol'' of
39, and moderately elevated blood pressure would have a 1-in-3
chance of suffering a possibly fatal heart attack by the age of 65.
</P>
<P>
   That's twice the average risk for a Framingham man this age, and
almost five times what it would be if coronary risk factors were
under control.
</P>
<P>
   A 55-year-old woman with the same risk profile would have a 13
percent likelihood of a heart attack or other coronary disease
within 10 years _ almost twice what it could be with good control
of risk factors.
</P>
<P>
   The Framingham researchers hope their scorecard, or something
similar, will gain widespread use among US doctors and patients.
The timing is propitious. The nation's 78 million baby boomers are
just entering their most coronary-prone years. And a national
quality-control watchdog will soon begin asking health maintenance
organizations to report the proportion of heart patients that is
meeting target levels of blood cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   But before the risk predictor can gain acceptance, it has to be
tested to be sure it is applicable to other populations. ``The
Framingham Heart Study population is all white,'' observed Ralph B.
D'Agostino, a Boston University mathematics professor involved in
the scorecard's development. ``Does this make any sense for
Japanese-Americans? For blacks? Does it apply to elders?''
</P>
<P>
   A workshop to address those questions is scheduled for January
at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately the goal is for all Americans to know their heart
disease risk score.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a very powerful tool for primary care
physicians,'' said Lenfant, the heart institute director. ``We'd
have to convince practitioners to use it. Admittedly that may be a
bit difficult, but eventually I think it will happen.''

   HURRICANE GEORGES
</P>
<P>
   GEORGES _ OCEAN SPRINGS, Miss. _ The Gulf Coast groaned under
the fury of Hurricane Georges, which moved ashore with gusts as
high as 172 mph early today as it spewed wind and rain from the
Florida Panhandle to Louisiana. New Orleans hoped it had avoided
the worst the storm could offer. No deaths or injuries had been
reported, but National Guard troops using trucks and boats had to
rescue about 200 people from flooded homes in the Florida
Panhandle, where most roads were reported flooded and Interstate 10
was washed out near the Alabama line. The hurricane's eye,
surrounded by wind blowing at a sustained 105 mph, moved ashore
this morning at Ocean Springs, between Biloxi and Pascagoula, and
the National Hurricane Service in Biloxi reported a gust to 172
mph. Within two hours, the wind started rising again at Pascagoula.

   TENGRAND _ At the urging of a suburban Atlanta police chief, and
with the intent to take a bite out of drug dealers' proceeds, U.S.
Sen. Max Cleland has introduced a bill that would make it possible
for police to seize the cash of anyone carrying more than $10,000.
The cash is deemed seizable if, among other things, whoever has it
``provided false information to any law enforcement officer,'' if
it is found ``in close proximity to a measurable quantity'' of any
illicit drug or if a drug dog ``alerts'' when sniffing it. Some
police organizations have praised the bill. But some police
officers have quietly raised objections to it, asserting that the
bill legislates an assumption of guilt about anyone carrying large
sums of cash and that innocent people whose cash is seized would
have to go to court and prove their innocence to get the money
back. We're looking for a worthy spokesperson to take the ``con''
side of the issue. (Payne, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   TAKE-BOS  
 ST. PETERSBURG, Russia: ... pretty much it.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She arrived the year Rudolf Nureyev defected. ``Because of that,
you weren't allowed to mention his name,'' she says. ``Since we
were the only Westerners here, the only people allowed to go back
and forth, I became the liaison between Rudi, in London, and his
mother, in St. Petersburg. I'd take him films of her.''
</P>
<P>
   When still a reigning ballerina, the aging Dudinskaya had
selected Nureyev as her partner, quite an honor for the young
dancer. Dudinskaya still resides in the same apartment on Gogol
Street that she's occupied since the end of World War II: She
avoided the Siege of Leningrad by dancing in Perm. She's a
survivor, with a survivor's instinct for never throwing anything
away because you never know. Empire furniture mixes in her
apartment with plastic tablecloths, photos, posters, figurines,
cuckoo clocks, medals, trophies, a pair of toe shoes signed by
Boston Ballet dancers she's coached, and a refrigerator proudly
displayed in the dining room. Holmes brings Dudinskaya a photograph
of her daughter, Lian-Marie _ another object for this live-in
collage.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes remembers, from her years in Russia, what it felt like
not to have enough of something. ``One year, my mother sent me toe
shoes, chocolates, and cough drops for Christmas,'' she says. ``The
people at the post office sent it all back to her _ after putting
their fingers through every chocolate _ because the cough drops
were `medicine,' which you weren't allowed to receive from
outside.'' Advil and ibuprofen are still the hostess gifts of
choice for Westerners to bring to Russian dancers. They invite you
to dinner; you bring pills instead of flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes, who has had an entrepreneurial life apart from dance,
running the first fast food restaurant in London and a shoe factory
in Oak Ridge, Tenn., betrays a certain impatience with Russian lack
of ingenuity. The Grand Hotel has huge windows that really open _
and signs asking guests not to, because insects might fly in. ``I
always said anyone who brought window screens here would make a
fortune. I mean, have you seen a single window screen? And the
mosquitoes are awful.''
</P>
<P>
   After Holmes left Russia in 1965, she danced all over Europe and
America, made dance films, ran a training program in Portugal, and
made the only complete film documentation of the entire Vaganova
system. This is a woman who drops into casual conversation the
sentence ``I directed the National Ballet of Rhodesia for a year so
I could see Africa,'' a woman of formidable energy. In 1985, she
became ballet mistress at Boston Ballet, and while she's gone all
over the world to stage Russian classics in the past decade, Boston
has remained her base.
</P>
<P>
   But St. Petersburg has a hold on her heart. It's a city she
loves for its art, architecture, music _ ``I used to hang my head
out the hotel window and listen to Rostropovich playing in the
Philharmonic across the street'' _ as well as for its ballet
traditions. ``One of the things I like about St. Petersburg is its
light and shade,'' Holmes says. ``It's not just bright. It's got
texture.'' It's also got contrasts, satellite dishes clinging to
the sides of 18th-century palaces.
</P>
<P>
   We walk past the Maryinsky, the holy of holies, where ``The
Nutcracker,'' ``Sleeping Beauty,'' and the first successful ``Swan
Lake'' all premiered. ``See those big round kiosks?'' Holmes asks.
``The night before I performed here for the first time, my name was
all over them. That's how I found out I was performing.'' The first
ballet she danced on that sacred stage was ``Flames of Paris,'' a
melodramatic Soviet tribute to the French Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   We go backstage, a maze of canteens, dressing rooms, rehearsal
spaces, and the entrance to the famous stage _ which is raked, to
give audiences a better view, and made of wood to cushion landings
from jumps, wood so soft it has to be replaced every four years.
Dancers are demigods in this world. ``There are excellent people to
take care of you,'' Holmes says. ``They wash your tights. They sew
you into your costume at the last minute, which makes it fit
better, and just razor out the stitches for quick changes. There's
a separate lady to hold a water glass and towel for you in the
wings. I didn't let them do my makeup, though. They were into
blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Another perk: ``Once you had an artist's pass from the Kirov,
you could go to all drama, music, and dance performances anywhere
in the city, for free,'' she says. ``All the theaters had artists'
boxes. We should have that in the West, so artists can see other
artists.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Maryinsky itself, the most significant building in
Petersburg's ballet world is the Vaganova school, training ground
of the most famous names in ballet, Pavlova to Baryshnikov, and
home to the Theater Museum, a place of pilgrimage for balletomanes.
Presiding over the decade-old museum is its vivacious curator,
Marina Vivien, who has thousands of costumes, posters, props,
photos, and programs in her care, the tangible evidence of an
ephemeral art. Only on the day of the museum's opening did Moscow
give her permission to put up photos of the defector-dancers, she
says. A whole case is now devoted to Nureyev. One of Vivien's
greatest treasures is Nijinsky's costume for Fokine's ``Le Spectre
de la Rose,'' the tights he wore when he electrified the world with
his entrance, leaping through a window, and the leotard with
hundreds of fabric petals stitched on. At each performance, a few
would fall off. They'd be gathered up by a servant who sold them to
besotted fans _ and eventually built himself a house with the
proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes and I drive around town with Anatoly Maltsev, a freelance
photographer who zooms through the city's rutted streets. We aren't
concerned. No way is he letting that $50,000 BMW _ how did he come
by it? _ acquire a single dent. Maltsev parks right in front of the
Hermitage, the great string of pastel palaces along the Neva River,
which house not only one of the world's largest museums but also
one of its smaller theaters. It was the czar's own, and the Romanov
symbol, a gilded double-headed eagle, still perches above the
proscenium. It is here that some rounds of the Vaganova competition
were held. Holmes and the other judges took notes as 20 teenagers
performed the same small number of variations from the classics.
The Russians, who have grown up on these dances, do them with a
difference: The plasticity of their torsos and necks, the fullness
of their arm gestures, set them apart. The kids from other
countries can do the steps well enough, but their dancing is
largely a thing of legs and feet, with the rest of their bodies
merely following along.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort not to become mere museum preserving the past,
Russian ballet has made stabs at updating itself, including an
early 1990s push to produce Balanchine-type dancers, long and lean.
``After a while the girls got so tall that none of the men could
lift them,'' Holmes says. ``It was like trying to lift a giraffe.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian companies have, by Western standards, loads of dancers,
generally enough to double-cast ballets so there's a tall cast and
a short one. Unlike Western companies, which tolerate differences
in dancer physiques, Russians prize uniformity. Dancers are chosen
to match, like pearls on a string. ``Even if they're not together
in unison,'' says Holmes, ``they look like they're together,
because they all have the same feet, the same legs, the same
style.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes says she's instituting Vaganova-style exams Boston
Ballet's students will take to pass from one level to the next,
``so graduating to the next level really means something.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes learned more than pirouettes in Petersburg. She also
learned the art of living in Russia. ``I remember waiting in line
three hours outside the hotel, to buy tomatoes,'' she says. ``I got
them up to my room and they were frozen, solid.'' On the other
hand, ``I was never afraid to walk on the street then. There was no
crime. That's all changed now.''
</P>
<P>
   A trip down Nevsky Prospekt with Holmes is, well, a trip. She
pops into her favorite basement cafe and orders a cappuccino.
``Their coffee used to taste like boiled socks. But it wasn't as
bad as the hotel's. Once, the hotel got in some coffee from Cuba
that was still green. They tried roasting it in the kitchen. You
can't imagine the smell. We had to drink it for about five months.
They just kept boiling it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't have hair dyes in different colors then, either.
They'd get in one color at a time, and you'd walk down the street
and everybody would be this brassy red. I always brought Dudinskaya
a supply of her color, which is Bashful Blonde, by Roux.''
</P>
<P>
   In those drab days what many Russians did for fun was get
divorced. Under Communism, doing so was exceedingly simple. ``I
knew a male dancer who kept a list of all his wives in his pocket
as a joke,'' Holmes recalls. ``He'd show it to people and say,
`Which one do I dance with today?'''
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, divorce is harder and Gucci has come to the Nevsky
Prospekt. But change is uneven. In shops and restaurants,
salespeople and waiters don't want to serve you, they want to be
you. Holmes and I made various stabs at eating outside the
protected oasis of the Grand Hotel, where every fleck of food is
shipped in from Germany because Russian supplies are unreliable. In
one restaurant, the waiter says, yes, they take Visa _ but it turns
out you have to tell the cashier ahead of time. Then there was the
waiter who gave us a multi-page menu to peruse and came back 15
minutes later to take our order, noting, however, that it was too
late to have food but we could have a drink if we wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Eisenstein's stampede scene, it's constantly
reenacted in the St. Petersburg Metro, which we took one day to go
to the Tikhvin cemetery, final resting place of a pantheon of
artists. Tchaikovsky sleeps in the company of a couple of bronze
angels _ and a lot of garish orange marigolds. The cemetery,
neglected during Communist times, is still choked with weeds.
Petipa has a relatively modest tombstone, a column topped with a
classical urn. Unlike the other famous composers here, he doesn't
rate an English marker on his grave. Nearby is a monastery church
where once again the bells are regularly rung and worshipers kneel
for long periods on bare stone floors.
</P>
<P>
   Taxicab meters are all broken, always. ``How much to the
Maryinsky?'' Holmes asks a cabdriver. ``Twenty-five dollars,'' he
replies. ``No,'' she says. ``Do you know how far it is to the
Maryinsky?'' he counters. ``I danced at the Maryinsky,'' she says.
The price plummets.
</P>
<P>
   Another illustration of the respect that ballet commands comes
with our adventure at the Church of the Holy Blood, a Disney-esque
extravaganza of gilded onion domes erected on the spot where Czar
Alexander II was assassinated in 1881. The church's fabulous
mosaics _ Byzantine icons crossed with Diego Rivera, stylistically
_ have just been restored, and Holmes wants to visit them. She is
shooed away from the box office with the $2 tickets and rerouted to
the one selling tickets at the ``foreigner's'' price _ $16.
Foreigner's prices are standard in Russia, where it is assumed that
all foreigners have unlimited funds and no sense whatsoever of
value for money. Hence the church charging more for one large
room's worth of mosaics than the Hermitage charges for entrance to
a thousand treasure-filled rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes refuses. The box office lady won't budge. Neither will
Holmes, who finally produces her judge's badge from the Vaganova
school and gives the lady a talk about the importance of artists
seeing art, for inspirational purposes. This works. In she goes _
for $2. If she's this tenacious in fund-raising for Boston Ballet,
the company's financial woes are fini.

ANNA-MARIE HOLMES IS AT HOME IN THE CITY OF NIJINSKY 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ Sitting in the Caviar Bar in the Grand
Hotel Europa, easily the fanciest five-star $300-and-up-a-night
hostelry in the whole country, Anna-Marie Holmes recalls her
previous visit here, as a guest in Room 428.
</P>
<P>
   She stayed for three years. Cost was no problem, because this
was back in the Soviet era. The government owned the hotel along
with everything else, and paid every ruble of her expenses. She
arrived in 1962, an 18-year-old from Mission City, British
Columbia, who had a dancer husband but no high school diploma, and
who, through talent and fluke, became the first North American to
dance with Russia's fabled Maryinsky Ballet, personally coached by
the equally fabled ballerina Natalia Dudinskaya.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes made one of many return trips this past summer, this time
in a position of authority herself. As artistic director of Boston
Ballet _ which opens its 1998-99 season this week (Oct. 1) with
Holmes's staging of a Russian-flavored ``Giselle'' _ and as one of
the foremost Western authorities on Russian classical style, she'd
been invited to sit on the panel judging the fourth Vaganova Prix.
The competition brought dozens of teenagers _ mostly from various
parts of the former Soviet Union, with a smattering from Japan, the
United States, and Canada _ to the city of Petipa, Balanchine,
Nijinsky, and Nureyev.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes also took time to show me her St. Petersburg. We strolled
past the shimmering mirage architecture willed into being by Peter
the Great and his successors. We visited Tchaikovsky's grave in the
Tikhvin cemetery, the tchotchke-filled apartment of the 86-year-old
Dudinskaya, and the Maryinsky Theater, the blue-and-white froth of
a building that is classical dance's most sacred site. We started
with the Grand Hotel Europe, which boasts a 19th-century facade by
Carlo Rossi, architect of Petersburg's colonnaded streets whose
perfect symmetry resembles that of a Petipa corps de ballet. A
favorite hangout of Pavlova and Tchaikovsky, the Grand has another
ballet connection _ glorious stained glass by Alexander Benois,
designer of the original ``Les Sylphides'' and ``Petrouchka.''
</P>
<P>
   Heaping caviar on a sliver of toast as a smiling waiter pours
her wine, Holmes recalls that standards at the Grand were different
in the Soviet years. ``We'd order room service before we went to
the theater to perform,'' she says, ``and after we got back, it
would come. Eventually.'' Amenities in the '60s included bugging in
all the rooms _ she and her husband turned on the water in the
bathtub at full force to muffle their private talks _ and a burly
``key lady'' on every floor, who kept tabs on guests. ``I remember
the day when the guy who bugged my room fell down the marble
staircase with all his equipment,'' Holmes says with glee worthy of
Eloise, the little girl who lived at the Plaza Hotel and delighted
in terrorizing the management.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason Russian ballet has so intrigued the West is
that it's been swathed in secrecy. When the curtain lifts a bit _
when impresario Serge Diaghilev astonished Parisian audiences with
the revelation of Nijinsky's dancing and Fokine's choreography in
the early years of this century, when the string of dancer
defections started in the 1960s _ the West has gasped. The image,
once carefully guarded, has tarnished with Russia's recent
political and economic upheavals. Once Russian dancers were free to
leave, their exodus started to look like the stampede scene in
Eisenstein's ``Battleship Potemkin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I could hire any dancer graduating from the Vaganova school
now,'' says Holmes. ``They all want to leave.'' She adds that the
company many of them will join _ the once-mighty Maryinsky _ ``is
more demoralized now than in Communist times,'' plagued by lack of
funds and leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for many people, classical ballet still means Russian
ballet. Ballet didn't begin in Russia. Russia imported the art from
the West, in the early 18th century, when the empress Anna Ivanova
selected some servants' children to be trained by the French
dancing master Jean-Baptiste Lande. In the 19th century another
Frenchman, Marius Petipa, arrived in St. Petersburg. Petipa brought
the Imperial Ballet to its zenith, choreographing ``Sleeping
Beauty,'' ``Raymonda,'' ``La Bayadere,'' and, with his Russian
colleague Lev Ivanov, ``Swan Lake.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov was one of the teachers of Agrippina Vaganova, who
herself became Russian ballet's greatest pedagogue. Vaganova taught
Dudinskaya, who taught Holmes, who believes that the Russian system
is still the world's best. There's dissension on this point. Some
important voices in the ballet world now maintain that Paris has
regained the supremacy it ceded to Russia a century ago, that the
Paris Opera Ballet now offers the world's best schooling. Holmes,
who has imported a raft of Russian dancers, teachers, and coaches
to Boston, disagrees. ``The Vaganova system produces beautiful
dancers because it uses the whole body,'' she says. Other systems
of ballet training are more focused on legs, she adds. In the
Vaganova method, movement starts in the center of the body and
radiates outward.
</P>
<P>
   It was not just ballet, but Russian ballet that got Holmes
hooked in the first place. Her own early training was as haphazard
as Russian training is organized. ``My father would miss his dinner
on Friday nights and drive me to Vancouver for ballet class, even
though he opposed my dancing,'' she recalls. ``He wanted me to be a
nurse and stay home.''
</P>
<P>
   When Holmes was 11, a Russian dancer named Lydia Karpova moved
to Vancouver. A foot injury had cut short her career as a ballerina
with the Kirov, as the Maryinsky was called in Communist times:
She'd been relegated to character roles. ``I'd sit and watch her
dance in the studio,'' Holmes recalls. ``She seemed so lonely.''
Karpova became Holmes's teacher, instilling in the young Canadian
the basics of Russian ballet. Her grateful pupil sadly recalls that
decades later, Karpova died of gangrene rather than have her foot
amputated.
</P>
<P>
   At 16, Holmes joined the Royal Winnipeg Ballet. ``By then, I had
a really Soviet style, thanks to Karpova,'' she says. ``This woman
from the Russian Ministry of Culture came to Canada and saw me, and
said I should go to Russia to dance.'' A couple of rejected visa
applications later, she did. ``They asked me, `Moscow or
Leningrad?''' Holmes recalls. ``Leningrad,'' she said, and she and
her then-husband and fellow RWB member, David Holmes, were off.
They marched into the office of Kirov director Konstantin Sergeyev.
``He looked at us,'' says Holmes, ``and asked, `Who are you? We
don't have foreigners here.'''
</P>
<P>
   The ``foreigners'' not only stayed, they also got promoted from
advanced students to guest artists in five months, during which
time Holmes earned a high school diploma via a Canadian
correspondence school. Merely communicating was tough before Holmes
taught herself Russian. ``No one here spoke English then,'' she
recalls. ``Dudinskaya could say `arm' and `leg' but that was pretty
much it.''

`COLD WAR' A RIVETING HUMAN STORY ON A MASSIVE SCALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With his willingness to unleash torrents of talk on virtually
any subject, Ted Turner may well be the television industry's most
voluble player.
</P>
<P>
   But the flamboyant founder of CNN was a man of few words when
Pat Mitchell, president of Time Inc. Television/CNN Productions,
joined him for breakfast in August 1994 in a hotel dining room in
St. Petersburg, Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cold War!'' was Turner's cryptic greeting to Mitchell as she
walked into the room. She responded &UR;  &LR; jokingly: ``I hope it's
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for Mitchell, it wasn't. For the next four years, she and
British filmmaker Sir Jeremy Isaacs would be immersed in the
monumental task of producing a 24-part documentary series on one of
the most nerve-racking epochs in human history.
</P>
<P>
   Bearing the Turner-terse title of ``Cold War'' and narrated by
Kenneth Branagh, the documentary, beginning this week on CNN, will
air in one-hour installments through next April. Mark your
calendars, because it's riveting television. CNN proves itself
equal to the task of chronicling, and illuminating, the
decades-long nuclear standoff between the United States and the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The value of ``Cold War'' as a history lesson is obvious, but it
is its narrative power and human drama that make it so absorbing.
With footage from Soviet and East German archives that has not been
seen in the West before, plus hundreds of interviews of statesmen
and average citizens from both sides of the conflict, it is the
most comprehensive TV look yet at the 46-year stalemate between
democracy and communism.
</P>
<P>
   However familiar the material will be to those who lived through
the Cold War, and however dry the series gets at times, ``Cold
War,'' by placing events in their fullest global context, enables a
deeper understanding of what Mitchell rightly calls ``the story of
our generation.''
</P>
<P>
   In the process, ``Cold War'' may also help restore CNN's
reputation for seriousness of purpose, a reputation battered by the
Tailwind fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something revelatory in every hour,'' said Mitchell.
``It underscores how little we really did understand about each
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we had enough time to do it right, which is not always the
case in television,'' she added. (In fact, Turner originally wanted
the series to be 40 hours long, and he urged the producers not to
``skimp'' on such subjects as China and Africa.)
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's fellow executive producer, Isaacs, is no stranger to
big themes: His 1970s documentary ``The World at War'' shed a
revealing light on World War II. ``Cold War'' is equally
eye-opening, especially in the way it reminds us that the citizens
of many other countries _ from Korea to Vietnam to Hungary to El
Salvador _ suffered greatly because of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Isaacs said he and Mitchell decided early on
that the ``human experience'' of the Cold War had to be an integral
piece of the documentary to keep it from becoming a mere litany of
pronouncements by politicians and statesmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the players in this conflict did matter, so we tried to
convey not just what it's like to take a decision, but to live with
the decision _ what it was like if you were a citizen of Berlin
when the Wall went up, or a citizen of Prague when the tanks rolled
in, or an American schoolteacher threatened with losing her job
because she was a member of the Communist Party,'' said Isaacs.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Isaacs seized the opportunity to turn a spotlight
on the citizens of Eastern Europe, whom he calls ``the true heroes
of the Cold War,'' people who ``had a radically different
experience of the Cold War.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We protested about the Berlin Wall, but actually we were happy
to live with it,'' he said. ``The people of Eastern Europe were
buried alive. They were just told to stick it. They didn't know if
they were going to be fired on, but they risked their lives for
something they believed in. The happiness on their faces when the
Wall comes down and they get rid of their Soviet masters, that I
remember. I honor those people.''
</P>
<P>
   Isaacs hastens to emphasize that in addition to such individual
portraits, the series also explores the milestone events of the
Cold War and the thought processes of policymakers who presided
over what John F. Kennedy called ``a long twilight struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to show people what the defense strategy of `mutual
assured destruction' was, or why East German leaders begged
Khrushchev to put up the Wall, or why it was possible to reach an
arms-limitation accord, or why Nixon went to China,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Isaacs and Mitchell hope to make news with their documentary.
For instance, they say that Fidel Castro, in an interview conducted
for ``Cold War,'' acknowledges that nuclear missiles were armed and
ready to be launched during the Cuban missile crisis. ``That means
we were even closer to the brink than we thought we were,'' said
Isaacs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, according to Mitchell, another installment of
``Cold War'' describes an episode in 1983 when the Strategic Air
Command went on full alert in the mistaken belief _ due to a
communications mix-up _ that nuclear missiles had been launched
against the United States. ``That probably took us closer to
nuclear war than we have ever been,'' said Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the CNN series, interest in the Cold War is heating
up elsewhere on television. On Oct. 3 at 8 p.m., the History
Channel will air ``Inside the Cold War with Sir David Frost.'' The
two-hour special is a leader's-eye view of the conflict, with
excerpts from 44 interviews Frost conducted over the years with the
likes of Richard Nixon, Mikhail Gorbachev, Henry Kissinger, and
Robert F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   To make the CNN documentary, Mitchell, Isaacs, and other
producers watched thousands of hours of film (1 million feet of
film in all) and interviewed 527 eyewitnesses to history. George
Kennan, the US diplomat whose legendary ``Long Telegram'' from
Moscow in 1946 warned Washington of the Soviet threat, gave his
first television interview in years. The testimony of some
interviewees was gathered just in time: JFK aide McGeorge Bundy
died shortly after CNN interviewed him, as did a British diplomat
from the 1940s, Sir Frank Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Isaacs said he came away from the project with a greater
appreciation for President Dwight Eisenhower than he had as ``a
callow young fellow,'' and for President Ronald Reagan, ``who, in
spite of all the rhetoric about the `Evil Empire,' could come to an
agreement with Gorbachev.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Mitchell and Isaacs said they concluded that the Cold War
was probably unavoidable, chiefly because of the brutal tyrant who
looms over the first six episodes of ``Cold War'': Joseph Stalin.
While the series takes pains to offer the perspective of the Soviet
bloc, it does not _ at least in the 10 episodes seen by this writer
_ fall into the trap of moral equivalence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can argue about whether there was a plan for world
domination, but there was certainly a Soviet threat, and that
threat had to be countered,'' said Isaacs.

`PAULIE' WANTS CREDIBILITY `THE TRIAL' IS STUNNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES:  &UR; ``Paulie'' &LR;  _ All talking animal movies were not
created equal. ``Babe,'' the talking pig movie that should have won
the best picture Oscar, is king of the genre. This one, about a
wise-cracking parrot, inherently more credible than a wise pig,
falls flat because the parrot looks like what it is; a phony bird.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``The Trial''  &LR; _ It's difficult to explain why I like Orson
Welles's adaptation of Franz Kafka's novel with Anthony Perkins as
Josef K. While it's easy to criticize Perkins as overplaying the
role, he does suggest that vague, indefinable paranoia crucial to
the part. Welles's black-and-white visual style is stunning.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Two Girls and a Guy''  &LR; _ James Toback, one of Pauline Kael's
favored sons, continues to make some of the dullest movies
imaginable. Forget the idiotic sexual politics of this misanthropic
menage a trois, and you still have one of the dumbest movies of the
year.
</P>
<P>

   The gigantic ``Titanic'' continues a tidal wave, setting
unheard-of sales records on home video. Paramount Video refused to
comment on exact numbers, but Video Business's latest issue reports
that ``Titanic'' sold an average of 501 copies per store, which
puts it ahead of ``Men in Black'' and ``Jurassic Park,'' but still
behind the all-time champ _ ``The Lion King'' at 637 copies per
store. Many stores, including some in the Blockbuster chain, sold
out after the first week.

 ! poor, !! fair, !!! good, !!!! excellent  
 
 !! ``Clay Pigeons''  Yet another Western gothic wannabe, with a
serial killer running loose under Montana's big sky. Joaquin
Phoenix is sympathetic as the patsy, but Vince Vaughn's demento
isn't that scary, and the film, earnestly lurid as it tries to be,
can't avoid taking on a warmed-over quality. (R)
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !!! 1/2 ``Monument Ave.''  &LR; The Irish ``Mean Streets.'' This
code-of-silence film set in Charlestown is dark, edgy,
provisional-looking and immediate, with superb performances _
especially from Denis Leary, as a car thief wondeting how long he
can remain silent after his cousins have been murdered, and Colm
Meaney, as the deadly bully terrorizing them all. (Unrated)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !! 1/2 ``Pecker''  &LR; Once John Waters dealt in outrage. Here he deals
in amiable irony as a kid from a blue-collar neighborhood in
Baltimore finds himelf an instant celebrity when his sometimes
raunchy photographs of his friends and neighbors are hailed as the
new frontier in authenticicy by the Manhattan art world. No
cultural collision here, though. The characters are sweet (most of
them, anyway), and the film plays like a party to which Waters has
invited both camps. (R)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; (FR)!! ``Ronin'' &LR;  Post-Cold War action thriller searching for a
reason to go on, and finding it in a briefcase chased across France
by gangs of good and bad mercenaries. It's skillfully done, but
pretty generic. Its pleasures consist of watching pros (director
John Frankenheimer, actors Robert De Niro, Jean Reno, Stellan
Skarsgard) grapple with the fact that they're growing old in this
movie about professionalism for its own sake. (R)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !!! ``Seventh Heaven''  &LR; A charming, oblique French comedy about a
wife, traumatized in childhood, trying to thaw with the help of
hypnoisis and feng shui, then trying to prop up her sagging
husband, whose self-esteem falls as hers rises. Light touch,
healing energies, and ingratiating performances from Sandrine
Kiberlain, as the ethereal wife, and Vincent Lindon, as the husband
struggling to keep up with her. (Unrated)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !!! 1/2 ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries''  &LR; Merchant-Ivory
returns to winning form by foregoing its usual sheen and control
and taking its stylistic cue from the unruliness of trying to keep
up with these Joneses. Kris Kristofferson has the role of his
career as expatriate novelist and wise, honest father James Jones.
Leelee Sobieski shines as his sensitive daughter, upon whose loving
memoir the film is based. (R)

JONI MITCHELL ROARS BACK ON `TAMING THE TIGER' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joni Mitchell's new album, ``Taming the Tiger,'' has a frank
confession in the title track. ``I'm a runaway from the music
biz,'' she sings, and then goes on to criticize ``formula music''
on the radio, labeling it ``junk food for juveniles.'' Don't expect
to hear the song on any Top 40 stations soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to run away in order to keep the poet alive,'' says
Mitchell in an interview from Los Angeles. The new album, due in
stores Tuesday, is her first since 1994's ``Turbulent Indigo,''
which won two Grammy awards.
</P>
<P>
   The reclusive Mitchell, whose painterly folk-jazz and hippie
background have influenced contemporary acts from Jewel to Fiona
Apple, swung back into view recently with a West Coast tour with
Bob Dylan and Van Morrison; and with a well-received appearance at
the ``Day in the Garden'' concert at the original Woodstock site in
New York. She also has a two-hour pay-per-view concert, ``Taming
the Tiger: An Evening with Joni Mitchell,'' airing Nov. 6. (It was
taped at the Warner Bros. studio in Burbank, Calif., last May.)
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, 54, also just released a book of poetry and is
contracted for two more books: one a compilation of her paintings,
the other an autobiography. ``I probably have five novels in me _
if I was a novelist, _ just based on personal experience,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   She has been buoyed by a recent reunion with her daughter
Kilauren (whom she had given up for adoption years ago), though
this personal joy has been tempered by Mitchell's continued
frustration with the music business, which caused her to consider
retirement in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a painter's eye for innovation in a business that
thrives on second- and third-generation copycats,'' Mitchell says.
``I've got the wrong mentality for the game. I don't play the game
well. I'm not a politician, which more and more has become a
required quality in my business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, I dislike being pigeonholed. I make unorthodox music, so
that creates marketing difficulties for me. And there are
prejudices levied at me because of my interest in jazz.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Taming the Tiger'' probably won't solve those marketing
difficulties, but it's one of her best, most accessible albums
since her '70s peak with the influential discs ``Blue'' and ``Court
and Spark,'' which yielded the hits ``Help Me'' and ``Free Man in
Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   She takes some political shots in the song ``No Apologies''
(``Lawyers and loan sharks are laying America to waste''). She
applies her poetic eye to the meditative ``Harlem in Havana,''
about a carnival midway populated with eccentric characters. She
turns soothing in ``Stay in Touch'' (``Let light hearts remake us
... let the worries hush''), but turns feisty in the uptempo ``Lead
Balloon.'' It's about nervously spilling a drink on a boyfriend
she's trying to impress, noting in detail ``the tequila trickling
down his business suit.'' Other standouts are the wisdom-filled
``Facelift'' (```Happiness is the best facelift,'' she sings) and
the upbeat ``My Best to You,'' a blessing to her audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``My true fans are open to me,'' says Mitchell. ``And I got into
this business to be an artist, not a pawn of business. So I have to
fight for the right to inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   While it would seem natural that Mitchell would do more touring
to back the new record (she hasn't toured the East Coast in 15
years), she's feeling inspired to make an album of '40s and '50s
standards instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'd really like to do is not tour this album, but go
immediately into the studio while I'm fired up and do an album with
a big orchestra. That would be a thrill of a lifetime,'' says the
Canadian native. ``My roots as a singer lie in standards, really. I
know the words to many of them _ and I know all the melodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward this end, she just sang on two George Gershwin songs for
Herb-ie Hancock's new album, ``Gershwin's World.'' She joined
Hancock, Stevie Wonder, and saxophonist Wayne Shorter (who also
plays beautifully on her album) for ``loose, late-night sessions.
We did `Summertime' and `The Man I Love.' I loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's jazz affinities have taken her a long way from her
hippie folk-singing days. She almost laughs at that era now. ``I
came into folk music as an arts student to make some pin money,
because it was so easy,'' she says. ``So I entered the arena as a
folk musician and all these years later, I still get called a folk
musician, but that's not where my roots are. In less than six
months, I was a professional folk singer. That's how easy it is to
cop those chops.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell later dove headfirst into jazz, during the making of
``Hejira'' (1976) and ``Mingus'' (1979), in which she set lyrics to
Charlie Mingus's melodies. But the reception to ``Mingus'' also
helped her turn sour on the music biz.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time I did my `Mingus' project, I lost my airplay. And
for 25 years, I've been dismissed as too jazzy,'' she says. ``It's
kind of like being blacklisted for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The white press has had a problem with my jazz influences _
and it's always been levied against me. Generally, they're hostile
and frightened. I don't know why. Whatever it is, I can't expect to
be understood or reviewed sensibly in the bulk of the pop camp. ...
I'm tired of being flunked by Rolling Stone (magazine). I hear
they're going to flunk me again on this new album. I can take it,
but it's just stupid at this point.''

TOWARD AN UNDERSTANDING OF AMERICAN SLAVERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
MANY THOUSANDS GONE 
The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America 
By Ira Berlin. Harvard University Press. 497 pp. Illustrated.
$29.95. 
 
REMEMBERING SLAVERY 
African Americans Talk about Their Personal Experiences of Slavery
and Emancipation 
Edited by Ira Berlin, Marc Favreau, and Steven F. Miller. New
Press. 352 pp. Illustrated and accompanied by two 60-minute
audiotapes of interviews and readings. $49.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly 136 years after President Lincoln signed the Emancipation
Proclamation, slavery remains the unhealed wound on the American
soul. Every discussion of racial equality in America has its
taproot in slavery. No wonder it is a subject regarded with
trepidation and dread by both whites and African-Americans, even
when the debate is ostensibly about affirmative action, apologies
and reparations, or the stars-and-bars of the defeated Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   And no wonder the ``peculiar institution'' that once threatened
to break the back of this nation remains a topic of much
discussion. In recent years, several high-profile books and films
have sought to illuminate our understanding of American slavery.
Charles Johnson won the 1990 National Book Award for his novel
``Middle Passage,'' about a free black man who accidentally stows
away on a slave ship bound for Africa. Last year, Steven
Spielberg's sorely undervalued ``Amistad'' unearthed the story of
an 1839 slave mutiny and its aftermath. This month, Oprah Winfrey
will star in a film adaptation of Toni Morrison's elegiac
``Beloved,'' her harrowing tale of an escaped slave, and the
murdered child who haunts her. And on Oct. 19, PBS begins a
four-part documentary, ``Africans in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Into this period of renewed interest come two books from Ira
Berlin, one of this nation's foremost scholars on the slave era.
``Many Thousands Gone'' examines the first two centuries of
slavery, while ``Remembering Slavery'' is a compilation of
interviews conducted in the 1930s with former slaves. Both are
profound additions to our national historiography, immediately
invaluable to any understanding of the nearly 250 years of
African-American slavery.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Many Thousands Gone,'' Berlin presents a thorough and
extensive examination of early slavery. Almost every work dealing
with this sorrowful chapter in American history focuses on the
antebellum South _ the years between Eli Whitney's invention of the
cotton gin in 1792 (which made slavery a much more important part
of the nation's economy) and the shots fired on Fort Sumter in
1861, which marked the beginning of the Civil War. Certainly, these
are important years, the times when the abolitionist movement
wrestled with the national conscience, and when Americans on both
sides of the Mason-Dixon line came to understand that this
long-divisive issue could be settled only through bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   But Berlin, a history professor at the University of Maryland,
considers the evolution of slavery, and the changing nature of how
slaves were treated throughout the centuries. Though he never
understates the violence and domination practiced by slaveholders,
Berlin introduces the notion that slavery during its first two
centuries was ``a negotiated relationship,'' even if that
relationship was ``so profoundly asymmetrical'' that most discount
even the ``notion of negotiation'' between the owner and the owned.
He argues that ``while slaveowners held most of the good cards in
this meanest of contests, slaves held cards of their own. And even
when their cards were reduced to near worthlessness, slaves still
held that last card, which their owners well understood they might
play at any time'' _ which is to say, violent insurrection. To
consider anything less, Berlin writes, is to underestimate the
power of the slaves, who fashioned life, culture, and traditions
even under the watchful eyes of their masters.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin divides his study into four geographic regions: the
North; the Chesapeake region; the coastal low country of South
Carolina, Georgia, and Florida; and the lower Mississippi Valley.
Each territory relied on plantation farming, and the demand for
product _ say rice and indigo in South Carolina, or sugar and
cotton in Mississippi _ dictated how entrenched slavery became in
the various sections. The first black communities in America were
composed of ``Atlantic creoles,'' peoples of African and European
descent Berlin refers to as the ``charter generation.'' They were
indeed slaves, but not in the manner most people understand today.
Atlantic creoles were multilingual and multicultural people. In
many instances, they were more like indentured servants than slaves
as commonly recognized. Some became artisans and craftsmen; others
kept their own cattle and substantial tobacco crops. One man, a
Creole slave named Antonio who later changed his name to Anthony
Johnson, used money from his crops to win his freedom. By the time
of his death, he was a wealthy Virginian with slaves of his own.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important distinctions Berlin makes is the
difference between ``societies with slaves'' and ``slave
societies'': Within the former, slavery was considered just one
type of labor, and the harsh treatment of slaves was emblematic of
the treatment afforded all subordinates, whether they were
indentured servants or the poor in general. Still, they were
capable of earning a living and gaining their freedom.
</P>
<P>
   In slave societies, however, ``slavery stood at the center of
economic production, and the master-slave relationship provided the
model for all social relations: husband and wife, parent and child,
employer and employee, teacher and student,'' Berlin writes.
``Whereas slaveholders were just one portion of a propertied elite
in societies with slaves, they were the ruling class in slave
societies.'' What preceded the transformation of one society to
another was the discovery of a commodity for which there was an
international demand. For instance, the invention of the cotton
gin, a machine that separates seeds from cotton fibers, greatly
increased the profitability of cotton farming, and thus the need
for slave labor, at a time when the institution was on the wane.
</P>
<P>
   Slavery's revival, and its final brutal years, are recalled in
``Remembering Slavery,'' as vital and necessary a historical
document as anyone has ever produced in this country. Along with
Marc Favreau and Steven F. Miller, Berlin has gathered interviews
with former slaves conducted by the Federal Writers Project in the
1930s and 1940s. (Some of the original interviews were done by such
luminaries as Zora Neale Hurston.) For decades, these written and
taped interviews sat in the Library of Congress, though they have
been used as source material for writers and researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison and Johnson's novels about slavery are harrowing and
unforgettable. But they pale in comparison to the actual words and
memories of former slaves who for decades survived unspeakable
inhumanity _ rape, torture, the destruction of families. They tell
their stories with a plainspoken eloquence that contrasts vividly
with the horrors they recount. One woman, Harriet Smith, recalls
whippings that could be heard a mile away. Speaking about babies
and children snatched from their crying mothers, she says, ``I
could tell you 'bout it all day, but even den you couldn't guess de
awfulness of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The book covers such areas as family life, slave culture, and
the Civil War. Perhaps the most poignant chapter, ``Slaves No
More,'' has former slaves remembering their first sweet taste of
emancipation. Tom Robinson was born into slavery in North Carolina,
and sold away from his mother before his 11th birthday. He was a
slave in Texas when his master, Dave Robinson, whom he describes as
having been ``good to me,'' walked up to him in the field, and
informed him that he was, at last, free. Unable at first to
comprehend the news, he wandered away from the field to see if
other blacks were also ``all free alike.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can take anything. No matter how good you treat it _ it
wants to be free,'' Tom Robinson says. ``You can treat it good and
feed it good and give it everything it seems to want _ but if you
open the cage _ it's happy.''

AUTUMN COLORS BRING A WORLD OF GREEN FOR STATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN WECHSLER  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. - There's a buck to be made in the changing of the
leaves, and states are catching on.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire and Maine doubled their advertising budget for
fall tourism this year. In response, Vermont took out television
commercials for its own well-known fall foliage _ the first time
the Green Mountain state had done so since 1986. The state has
spent $180,000 on television and print ads promoting fall tourism.
</P>
<P>
   There's more. Virginia is not only for lovers, it's also for
leaf-peepers. So is its country cousin to the west. So are Ohio and
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the state will spend about $700,000 this year on
its fall foliage campaign, letting the world know the Empire State
contains more broad-leaf trees _ the ones that matter _ than any of
its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   All the players have learned the same thing: if you want people
to come and look at your yellow, red and orange, you have to spread
around a little green.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just about leaves any more. In the words of one
official, it's a ``tourism product.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We really focus on what New York state has to offer,'' said
Mary Ellen Walsh, a spokeswoman for the New York Division of
Tourism. The state's campaign began about three years ago. In 1996,
the state printed its first fall ``book,'' a pamphlet dedicated
entirely to what the state has to offer in the fall. This year,
state officials say they came up with a slogan that summed up the
many activities available in the Empire State.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did you expect?'' the slogan goes. ``This is New York
State.''
</P>
<P>
   Like any self-respecting state, New York also has a toll-free
fall foliage line set up. The number is 800-CALL-NYS.
</P>
<P>
   The state even put a two-page color ad in that most consummate
of New England magazines, Yankee, in an effort to lure tourists who
haven't already been sucked in by their own state's slogans.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? New York expects to make about $30 billion this
year from tourism, and about 25 percent of that will come in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Next door, Vermont has been busy as well. The state just
finished a major television commercial campaign in some major
cities, although not in New York. The concern was not just Maine's
heavy-duty leaf campaign, said Department of Tourism spokeswoman
Diane Konrady (whose answering machine includes the comments,
``It's a beautiful, sunshiny morning ... and the leaves are really
beginning to brighten'').
</P>
<P>
   The other problem, she said, was a devastating ice storm in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had even gotten some calls from people who thought we
weren't going to have a fall foliage season,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont stands to make about $800 million from leaf-peepers.
That's 2.2 million overnight visitors and 4 million day visitors.
</P>
<P>
   So which state has the best foliage? Doris Herwig of Hayfield
Quality Tours in Queensbury, N.Y., says it really doesn't matter.
She takes her customers where the leaves are.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no borders,'' she said. ``The trees know no
difference.''

CATHERINE DENEUVE, GODDESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Is there an actress in America who matches the depth,
the wattage, the sheer magnetism of Catherine Deneuve?
</P>
<P>
   If Lauren Bacall had developed range, if Marilyn Monroe had
grown up, if Jane Fonda had stuck with it, if Sharon Stone were as
regal as her pose, then maybe _ maybe _ someone who combined all
those essences would approach the De-neuvian glow.
</P>
<P>
   But in the world as we know it, she reigns alone.
</P>
<P>
   There she sat in the tearoom of a SoHo hotel, dressed in black,
with hip Cat Lady glasses, sipping her coffee, smoking her
ultrathin cigarettes, and trying _ at least enough for the sake of
politeness _ to act as if she didn't know she was a goddess.
</P>
<P>
   Deneuve is 54, and has done nothing to hide it _ not that she
needs to.
</P>
<P>
   She is known in the States mainly for her Chanel ads and for a
peculiar trio of film roles _ as a bourgeois prostitute (``Belle de
Jour''), a sexually suppressed psychotic (``Repulsion''), and a
lesbian vampire (``The Hunger'').
</P>
<P>
   But in her native France, she is practically a treasure. In her
youth, she had children with two of Europe's most glamorous
womanizers, Roger Vadim and Marcello Mastroianni, and refused to
marry either. Her face is the model for Marianne, the French
national symbol, on the country's postage stamps. And, at least on
weekends, she cannot step outside her house, near St. Sulpice in
Paris, without fear of being mobbed.
</P>
<P>
   The critic David Thomson, in his ``Biographical Dictionary of
Film,'' calls Deneuve ``a fantastic actress, her beauty a
receptacle for any imagination, perhaps the greatest cool blonde,
forever hinting at intimations of depravity.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearing this description read aloud in the tearoom, she thought
a few seconds, smiled, and said, ``I like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Deneuve was in New York recently to promote the Miramax reissue
of her 1967 film ``The Young Girls of Rochefort. It's the third of
her films from that era to hit theaters, in beautifully restored
prints, over the past three years _ the others being ``Belle de
Jour'' ('67) and ``The Umbrellas of Cherbourg'' ('64).
</P>
<P>
   ``Young Girls'' is a sort of antidote to ``Umbrellas'' _ like
it, a musical directed by Jacques Demy with a score by Michel
Legrand. But where ``Umbrellas'' is dark, rainy, and bittersweet _
a cognac of a film _ ``Young Girls'' is sunny-light and giddy, like
a pitcher of margaritas.
</P>
<P>
   It's a singularly dopey plot, full of fated lovers just missing
each other around endless corners, with the characters _ including
Deneuve and her real-life older sister, Francoise Dorleac, playing
twins _ singing and dancing their way through half the dialogue.
Still, it exudes a high-fly innocence that's irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a special time,'' Deneuve recalled wistfully. ``I don't
think now a musical could be done like that.''
</P>
<P>
   So how does she feel, watching it now, 31 years later?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I have not seen it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Really? She was flown across the Atlantic to do promo, and she
hasn't seen it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't watch my films,'' she said plainly. ``I mean, I see
them once, but it's something I've done and I'm gone. There is
always a film of mine on TV, at least three a month. I can watch
10-15 minutes, maximum.''
</P>
<P>
   Does her reluctance to watch this film have anything to do with
the fact that Dorleac died in a car crash a few days after the
production ended?
</P>
<P>
   She hesitated. ``I cooperated with a French TV documentary about
my sister last year,'' she said. ``I did a long interview about
her. In doing it, I got to see little pieces of this film again. It
was the first time I had talked about her, really.
</P>
<P>
   ``But no,'' she added quickly, ``it's not for that reason,
frankly, that I did not see the whole film. It's more a question of
wanting always to be on the move, not stopping to watch something
that's already done.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Deneuve has always been on the move. She has made
over 70 films in the past 30 years, several with Europe's top
directors (Francois Truffaut, Luis Bunuel, Roman Polanski, Claude
Chabrol).
</P>
<P>
   But, in all this time, she has made only three American movies
(``The Hunger,'' ``The April Fools,'' and ``Hustle''), none of them
bound for Top 100 _ or Top 500 _ lists, though ``The Hunger,'' the
erotic vampire hoot with Susan Sarandon and David Bowie, has a
strong cult following.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been offered parts in American movies,'' Deneuve said,
``but not many I was interested in. I'm not going to come to
America to do a less interesting film than the ones I do in
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   She does not engage _ well, not completely _ in the cliched
French contempt for les choses americaines. When I told her I could
imagine her in a Woody Allen movie, she raised her eyebrows, said,
``Yeah, me, too,'' and laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like American movies,'' she went on. ``I would like very
much to work with Woody Allen or Martin Scorsese, Francis Coppola,
Jonathan Demme. And I'm sure there are others I could make an
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Has she let these directors know of her desires? ``Yes, I tried
sometimes,'' she said in a vague tone, ``but it's much more
complicated than that. There is no reason why a director would pick
a French actress. There is always the problem of the accent. Yes, I
could play a Frenchwoman, but that's it. It's very limiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many _ perhaps not any _ famous American actress would
choose the roles Deneuve has most relished. ``It's the whole system
that is different, no?'' she ventured. ``When you have a name and a
position of being at a certain level _ when you rise to that Top 10
_ it's more difficult to take chances because it's hard to stay
there. When you have a big budget and an obligation to make your
money back, you have to stay to a certain kind of story, you cannot
take chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's especially difficult for a very good-looking
woman to have very interesting parts here,'' she went on. ``Sharon
Stone _ she's a very beautiful woman, but I don't see what happened
with some of her choices.'' She shook her head, as if in pity. ``I
never had these problems, because in Europe it's a very different
attitude toward cinema. You can do a commercial film, then an
artistic film that doesn't have the success, and the sanction is
not immediate _ the sanction of not being able to do what you want
next.''
</P>
<P>
   Deneuve does not want to ignore the American cinema altogether.
She has plans to make a film here next year, a US-Canadian
production of an Edith Wharton novel. ``It has a French director,
but,'' she sighed, ``it is in English.'' So what role will she
have? She shrugged, ``I play a Frenchwoman _ of course.''

THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT BILL

<TEXT>
<P>
   The befuddled Don Imus was on the phone with Bob Dole Tuesday,
asking ``Where's the outrage?'' just as the former Republican
candidate had asked about his opponent two years ago. Only this
time the cause of concern was that the public wasn't reacting to
Bill Clinton's adultery in the way that Preacher Don wanted them
to.
</P>
<P>
   If the poll numbers are any indication of his fate, Clinton will
elude his political foes one more time and stay in office following
the masterful piece of performance art he turned in against Kenneth
Starr's faceless inquisitors. And once again it will be his friends
in the entertainment industry who bailed him out. Only this time it
wasn't members of the liberal establishment like the
Bloodworth-Thomasons, Steven Spielberg, or Barbra Streisand.
</P>
<P>
   It's the entertainment industry as a whole that has paved the
way for the American people to shrug off Clinton's marital
indiscretions. The entertainment industry has made pushing the
envelope America's national pastime, and both Bill Clinton and Don
Imus have been the beneficiaries of the way that game is played
today.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of friends who could have been poster women for Middle
America were waiting in their doctor's office recently, chuckling
over the movie that they and millions of other Americans had made
one of the hits of the summer, ``There's Something About Mary.''
And for good reason. The considerably talented Farrelly brothers
bask in their bad taste and their ability to make audiences squirm.
</P>
<P>
   This is a comedy in which a dog catches on fire, a mentally
retarded boy is the unmerciful butt of the filmmaker's jokes, oral
coitus is constantly interruptus, masturbation and its aftermath
figure prominently in a dinner scene, and the hero has a zipper
problem the likes of which make the president's look
run-of-the-mill.
</P>
<P>
   Moralists of the left and right may wonder where the outrage is
at any or all of the above, but the rest of America is too busy
laughing to care. This is a rather amazing turn of events for a
country whose comedy was not that long ago defined by ``The Cosby
Show'' and ``Tootsie.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened in the intervening years is a triumph of
Reaganism, not of Moral Majority values but marketplace values. As
cable television made inroads, network television responded to what
was permissible. The movie industry has always responded to
television, knowing that people would never pay for what they could
get for free.
</P>
<P>
   Dole would get outraged about that, too, but when the successor
to ``Cosby'' in terms of defining prime-time comedy featured an
episode about masturbation, the ratings only went up. Today that
and other ``Seinfeld'' episodes can be seen at 7 p.m. It was
considered shocking a few years ago that the family hour was
declared dead and buried by NBC's decision to show the more than
platonic ``Friends'' at 8. Now those reruns have inched up to 7:30.
Anybody for ``South Park'' at 6?
</P>
<P>
   The issue isn't about lax moral standards in television and the
movies, as much as William Bennett and other conservative
commentators would like you to think it is. The issue is that the
vast majority of Americans have accepted casual sexuality as part
of the central culture.
</P>
<P>
   But isn't there a difference between the president of the United
States and the star of a situation comedy? That's where those who
have used Clinton for target practice may be his biggest allies.
For one thing, they have made it a commonplace assumption that the
president of the United States is no different than anybody else.
Isn't that what separates the jokes on the Leno and Letterman
monologues from those by Johnny Carson about Ronald Reagan and
George Bush? They were fodder for being too removed from everyday
concerns and were almost always ``President Reagan'' and
``President Bush'' to Carson. The current president routinely is
referred to as ``Clinton'' by Leno.
</P>
<P>
   Leno, Letterman, and Imus have been telling us for longer than
Clinton has been in the White House that the president is a man of
uncontrollable appetites. ``Why is the White House happy to release
the video of Bill Clinton testifying before the grand jury?'' asked
Letterman last week. ``It shows he can go three hours without
having sex.'' A Leno bit had a Clinton impersonator doing a takeoff
of one of those CD ads singing snippets of ``Addicted to Love''
(complete with Lewinsky look-alikes in the chorus) and ``Me So
Horny.''
</P>
<P>
   These jokes about his appetites were commonplace even before the
scandal, and so when the rumors turned out to be true he turned out
to be no worse than the person Leno and Letterman viewers suspected
he was all along.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton aside, Letterman and Leno have made jokes about adultery
and oral sex commonplace. As for sex with a much younger woman,
Imus could _ and has _ told us a thing or two about that. None of
these shows could have gotten their subject matter before
mainstream America until relatively recently _ the last 15 years or
so.
</P>
<P>
   What the current popularity of a movie like ``There's Something
About Mary,'' acceptance of sex on prime-time TV, and the sexual
frankness on the programs of Leno, Letterman, and Imus all tell us
is that Americans have become more like Europeans _ i.e., unlikely
to be shocked about sex between consenting adults or their trying
to cover it up. So if the I-man wants to know where's the outrage
about Clinton's actions, maybe he should listen to his own show
sometime.

HOW TO WRITE A GREAT HOLIDAY NEWSLETTER
</HEADLINE>

 (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's LifeBeat
lifestyle package.)

prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
CONNIE WHITE in Kansas City at 1-800-444-0267 or 816-822-8448, or

<P>
   Sending a holiday card and an annual letter is often our only
communication with certain family members and friends.
Unfortunately, most letters border on boring and banal and often
include inappropriate information, such as every health malady and
financial woe the family has suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Each year Barb Freda of Louisville, Ky., gets a holiday letter
from one friend that includes ``stuff like losing a job or the
therapy she's been in,'' says Freda, who would prefer to have her
spirits lifted up -- not brought down -- by the holiday greetings
she receives.
</P>
<P>
   If you decide to tuck a holiday letter in your Christmas,
Hanukkah or Kwanzaa cards this year, make sure you heed the
following advice. If you do, you'll create a letter that your
friends and family will want to read -- instead of toss in the
trash:
</P>
<P>
   _ Take time to plan. Deirdre and Jeff Robinson of Ellicott City,
Md., spend about 10 hours each year planning their annual letter, a
newsletter called the Robinson News Network's Bedtime News. ``We
sit down and brainstorm the things that have happened during the
year,'' explains Deirdre, ``and then we try to look for common
themes in order to break the list up into corresponding topics.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Florence Isaacs, author of ``Just a Note to Say'' (Clarkson
Potter, 1995, a book on how to improve personal correspondence,
``I'd keep a file all year long for your annual letter and keep
throwing in quotes and anecdotes you pick up from newspapers as
well as your own notes on memorable happenings at your house.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Include friends' milestones as well as your own. The Robinsons
devote an entire section of their newsletter to weddings and births
because ``people like to see their name in print, and it's a way
for me to get news out to those who don't necessarily stay in touch
with the same people we do,'' says Deirdre. (Last year's newsletter
mentioned three nuptials and nine births.) ``I'm at an age when
most of my contemporaries and I are starting to have kids,'' adds
Freda, who loves hearing about which children have come into the
world in the previous calendar year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Include some laughs. When Tim Harper of Ridgewood, N.J.,
chronicled his wifes unsuccessful attempt to get more exercise in
the bygone year, he wrote in the Harper holiday letter: ``Nancy has
learned to avoid feeling guilty about ignoring the Nordic Track in
the basement by avoiding the basement.'' Tim also poked fun at
himself by recalling his kids' involvement in a Cub Scout derby and
school elections. ``We reckon they would have gotten first place
and president,'' he wrote, ``if their dad hadn't helped Jonathan
build his race car and helped Lizzie with her campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Get creative with your layout. One reason the Robinson's chose
a newsletter format was so they could create a handful of
mini-articles, which would allow ``people to read only the parts
that interest them,'' says Deirdre. When the Harper family returned
in 1993 after living in London for nine years, their annual letter
took the form of a list. The categories? Their top 10 surprises on
moving back to America. Their 1994 letter included headlines on all
the ways the family had become suburban stereotypes. One such
headline: ``We drove our Volvo wagon over the bikes in our
driveway.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Jazz it up with pictures. Letters don't have to be all words _
you can communicate your message through kid-created drawings or
photographs. ``A friend of mine crops a bunch of photos taken
during the year, adds handwritten captions, and color-copies it,''
adds Deirdre, who chose to create her own letter on the computer so
she could use clip art from software programs to liven up the
newsletter's look and give it a real Christmas feel. A past
newsletter featured a silhouetted picture of the manger scene.
</P>
<P>
   _ Trim that mailing list. ``I've received a Christmas letter
every year from someone I met once 25 years ago,'' says Isaacs.
``It's full of details about family members I don't know or have
never heard of. It's like getting a canned letter to constituents
from a politician running for office.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Pen a personal note. ``The key to a good holiday letter is
personalizing it in some way with a handwritten note,'' says
Isaacs, whose book has a chapter devoted entirely to holiday
greetings. ``You can talk about what the holiday means to you and
what you wish for them, about prayers for peace, about their family
and the general joy of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't feel compelled to write a lengthy message. ``A line or two
will do it,'' Isaacs adds. ``The idea is to make the recipients
feel you are writing specifically to them.

FOODS THAT ACT LIKE MEDICINE
</HEADLINE>
  By JACQUELINE STENSON 
 (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's LifeBeat
lifestyle package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
CONNIE WHITE in Kansas City at 1-800-444-0267 or 816-822-8448, or

<P>
   The last thing many of us want to do when we're sick is eat. And
when we do feet up to grabbing a bite, we usually reach for soup
and crackers, or dry toast and tea.
</P>
<P>
   But there are lots of ``other foods that can also help ease your
symptoms and speed your recovery,'' says Eileen Behan, a dietitian
and author of ``Cooking Well for the Unwell'' (Hearst Books, 1996).
</P>
<P>
   Some foods can make you feel better because they contain special
ingredients that actually promote healing. Other foods work because
they won't aggravate your symptoms. Still others people find
helpful, even though there are no scientific studies that prove
they are.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the best comfort foods for your most common health
complaints:
</P>
<P>
   _ Cure a cough. The best way to quiet a cough is to have plenty
of fluids like water and fruit juice. Drink as much as you
comfortably can, says Dr. Norman H. Edelman, a pulmonary specialist
on Long Island, N.Y. ``Staying hydrated prevents the lining of the
nose and throat from drying,'' he explains. ``This also helps keep
any excess mucus moist and flowing out of the body.'' Gelatin and
fruit shakes can also replenish bodily fluids.
</P>
<P>
   Hot liquids (like broth, bouillon and caffeine-free tea) are
especially effective; the steamy vapors help thin nasal secretions
and loosen phlegm. Or try a bowl of chicken soup. One study at the
University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha found that this
popular folk remedy has a mild infection-fighting effect.
</P>
<P>
   _ Soothe a sore throat. ``Even water can be difficult to swallow
when you have a scratchy throat,'' says Behan. ``Thicker fluids are
actually easier to get down.'' She recommends frothy shakes made
with skim milk and noncitrus fruits and juices, like banana and
cantaloupe. (Citrus can further irritate the lining of the throat,
so avoid orange, grapefruit and lemon.)
</P>
<P>
   Soft foods are also easier to swallow, says Behan. Choose baked
vegetables over raw, and roasted meats over grilled. (Use gravy and
stocks to keep meals moist.) Oatmeal, gelatin, casseroles, cream
soups, stews, poached or scrambled eggs, mashed potatoes and
puddings are good bets, too. Whenever possible, finely chop food or
puree it in a blender.
</P>
<P>
   To keep your throat moist between meals, sip some hot
caffeine-free tea with honey (caffeine promotes dehydration), or
suck on hard candy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clear up congestion. Feel stuffed up? Drink lots of water and
fruit juice. Fluids _ especially warm ones _ can help liquefy mucus
and clear up congestion. Warm apple cider should do the trick, and
as long as it's caffeine free; so should some hot tea.
</P>
<P>
   You might also want to spice up your food with cinnamon, garlic,
chili powder or red-pepper flakes. According to Behan, flavoring
your meals with these strong spices can unclog a stuffy nose.
(Salsa also works.) But go easy on the spices, especially if you
have a cold: ``Foods that are too spicy can aggravate other
symptoms, like a cough or a sore throat,'' says Behan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fight a fever. Mom was right: You need to ``feed a fever.''
When your immune system fights an infection (like the flu), your
metabolism speeds up and demands more fuel. So forget about
counting calories for a while, says Behan. ``If all you want to eat
is macaroni and cheese, then go ahead.'' Just be sure to drink
plenty of water and fruit juice (like apple and orange) to stay
hydrated, says Edelman.
</P>
<P>
   Water-based foods (such as gelatin and soup) can also help
replenish fluids. Avoid alcohol and beverages that contain
caffeine; they can promote dehydration. Hot liquids like soup and
caffeine-free tea are especially effective at reducing a fever;
they cool down your body by causing you to sweat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Halt a headache. What to do for a splitting tension headache?
Try a shot of coffee. In small doses, ``caffeine can help ease
headache pain because of its ability to constrict blood vessels,''
says Dr. Seymour Diamond, director of the Diamond Headache Clinic
in Chicago. But limit yourself to no more than 8 ounces of coffee a
day. ``If you get used to having too much caffeine, you may
experience withdrawal later on and suffer even more headaches.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you wake up to a ``hangover headache''
from drinking too much alcohol the night before, then water is a
better choice. (Coffee will only make you feel more awake.) What
also works: some honey on dry toast, and fruit juice. ``The sugar
helps the body metabolize alcohol more quickly,'' says Diamond.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ease nausea. Feel queasy? Sip some ginger ale. ``Ginger is
considered to be especially effective in easing nausea,'' says Pat
Baird, author of ``Be Good to Your Gut'' (Blackwell Science,
1996)..
</P>
<P>
   When you no longer feel nauseated, try a clear-liquid diet of
water, broth and bouillon. Slowly work your way to gelatin, frozen
fruit pops and dairy-free fruit shakes. These foods are not only
easy to digest, they can also help you replenish fluids lost from
vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   Think you can handle something more solid? The so-called ``white
diet'' is prescribed. It consists of bland foods such as
applesauce, boiled potatoes and white rice-which are easy to
tolerate. Salted foods like crackers can replace salt that vomiting
leaches from the body.
</P>
<P>
   _ Relieve constipation. Adding more fiber to your diet can help
keep you ``regular.'' Insoluble fiber _ the kind that doesn't
dissolve in water _ is especially effective. According to Baird,
this type of fiber works like a sponge, absorbing water to create a
soft, bulky stool.
</P>
<P>
   Good sources of insoluble fiber include apples, bran, beans,
spinach and dried raisins and prunes. But go easy on the fiber at
first: Fiber can cause gas if you're not used to having a lot of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, be sure to drink at least eight glasses of water a day.
If there isn't enough water in your gut, says Knapp, fiber will get
stuck there and produce constipation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Control diarrhea. Fiber can also be effective in treating
diarrhea. However, ``only soluble fiber (the kind that dissolves in
water) has been shown to help,'' says Behan. Good sources of
soluble fiber include citrus fruits, oatmeal and potatoes. Or try a
regimen of bananas, rice, applesauce and toast _ also known as the
BRAT diet.
</P>
<P>
   Since a considerable amount of fluid is lost during bouts of
diarrhea, clear liquids (like water) and strained ices (like
orange) are highly recommended. ``But don't give apple or pear
juice to children with diarrhea,'' warns Dr. Steven Peikin, chief
of gastroenterology at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in
Camden, N.J. ``These juices contain a high amount of sorbitol, a
form of sugar that can make diarrhea in children worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, cut down on foods that are fried or high in fat.
They'll only aggravate diarrhea, as will bran, beans, honey, dates,
prunes, dried figs, raw vegetables (like cabbage) and whole-milk
products. Coffee, tea, soft drinks with caffeine, and other
diuretics should be avoided for this reason, too.

NEW WAYS TO MANAGE KIDS' PAIN
</HEADLINE>
  By MONIKA GUTTMAN 
 (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's LifeBeat
lifestyle package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
CONNIE WHITE in Kansas City at 1-800-444-0267 or 816-822-8448, or
by fax at 816-822-1444.)  From Child magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two-year-old Matthew Callahan came home from his sister's soccer
game a little subdued and favoring his right arm. His mom, Lori,
saw nothing swollen or bruised. She gave him acetaminophen and a
hug and kept her eye on him as he played.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, the Los Angeles mother decided a doctor
should check her son since he still seemed uncomfortable. Sure
enough, Matthew's elbow was out of its socket. After a pediatric
orthopedist popped the elbow back into place, Matthew's arm was a
little sore, but the serious pain was on its way out.
</P>
<P>
   All parents are faced with handling a child's pain at one time
or another. Even minor cuts, scrapes or burns can be alarming to
both adult and child. When the source of the pain is hard to
identify, as Matthew's was, parents face the daunting task of
determining just how bad the pain is and deciding what should be
done about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every child experiences some kind of unexplained pain,
like stomachaches or growing pains,'' says Dr. Lonnie Zeltzer,
director of the Pediatric Pain Program at the University of
California at Los Angeles. Fortunately, something of a revolution
has changed the way children's pain is treated by health
professionals, and parents now have more options and information
than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a shift among both families and physicians,''
says Dr. Neil Schechter, professor of pediatrics at the University
of Connecticut in Storrs and a leading pediatric pain expert. The
prevailing attitude, Schechter adds, is that ``pain in children is
unnecessary for the most part; it's detrimental, and things can and
should be done about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as recently as 15 years ago it was not uncommon for
kids, particularly infants, to have major operations such as
open-heart surgery or amputations without anesthesia. It was
believed that children, especially newborns, did not experience
pain the way that an adult does because of their immature nervous
system, explains Schechter.
</P>
<P>
   Further, little was known about the safety and efficacy of
giving pain medications to children, since they were developed for,
and tested on, adults only. And some physicians were reluctant to
use anesthesia, fearing that it might put children at further risk
for complications during surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to accumulating research, however, pediatricians and
anesthesiologists at major pediatric hospitals now advocate a more
aggressive approach to children's pain. Most compelling are a
number of studies suggesting that children who experience pain heal
more slowly, need more subsequent medical attention and are more
anxious about pain in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   A guideline for treating acute pain in infants, children and
adolescents issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services in 1992 acknowledged that ``unrelieved pain has negative
physical and psychological consequences'' and concluded that
``techniques are now available that make pain reduction to
acceptable levels a realistic goal in the majority of
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the attitude shift more evident than in the use of
anesthesia for circumcision. In its 1989 policy report on
circumcision, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) cautiously
stated that more data was needed before it could advocate local
anesthesia for that procedure. Last year the AAP decided to revise
its policy, and new guidelines due later this year are expected to
support anesthesia for all circumcisions.
</P>
<P>
   Such revised thinking about children's pain is causing
healthcare practitioners to be more sensitive to their young
patients' pain and to provide more information about pain
medications to parents. Many hospitals and doctors' offices now
offer booklets and videos on pain and how to treat it.
</P>
<P>
   That is good news to Leora Kuttner, author of ``A Child in Pain:
How to Help, What to Do'' (Hartley &AMP; Marks, 1996). Kuttner believes
that ``there's a great deal we can do and we still don't do'' about
kids' pain. ``If we wait,'' she says, ``pain begets more pain, so
it's very important as a general principle to use whatever is
available and will be effective to control and begin to relieve
pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Relieving pain also takes away much of the fear children
naturally feel when they're suffering. For parents who balk at the
notion of piling on the painkillers, new research suggests that
alternative methods as simple as massage or the application of ice
are highly effective at reducing pain in children.
</P>
<P>
   At UCLA's Pediatric Pain Program, which has nearly a 100 percent
success rate in treating children with severe chronic pain, Zeltzer
advocates the use of drugs combined with other therapies like
psychiatry, massage, acupuncture, biofeedback and guided imagery.
Other pain-relieving techniques are even simpler: blowing bubbles
that ``carry the pain away'' and putting on a ``magic glove'' that
helps reduce the pain of inoculations and drawing blood. Even
rubbing or blowing on an ``owie'' gives relief because rubbing
engages nerves that help dull pain, and blowing causes a child to
relax by breathing deeply.
</P>
<P>
   These are techniques that parents can use every day to help
their children cope with everything from a scrape to an injection.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Staying calm makes a difference &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are also discovering that a parent's response to a
child in pain plays a vital role in how the child experiences that
pain and how fast he recovers. A parent who reacts with calmness
and confidence instead of alarm _ ``Oh, my God, what are we going
to do?'' _ gives the child a sense that the pain is under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he can let go of the scary feelings that sometimes linger
longer than the pain itself,'' says Kuttner. ``It's like the song
from ``The King and I'' _ the parent has to 'whistle a happy tune'
and act confident even if she doesn't feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuttner recalls the time her then 14-month-old son grabbed a
rack inside a hot oven, suffering second- and third-degree burns on
his hand. On the way to the emergency room, with a bag of frozen
peas wrapped in a towel around his hand, she kept saying, ``Feel
how nice and cold the peas are. We'll soon be at the hospital;
they'll have powerful medicine to take all the pain away.''
</P>
<P>
   New technologies on the horizon should help parents and
physicians make pain relief even easier and more effective. Trials
are under way to test the delivery of medications and routine
inoculations in lollipop form, say pain experts.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Zempsky of the Connecticut Children's Medical Center
in Hartford works with Numby Stuff, a needle-free method of
delivering local anesthesia directly into the skin using a
low-level electric current from a small, battery-powered
microprocessor. Within 10 minutes the skin becomes numb,
eliminating the pain of drawing blood or giving shots,
</P>
<P>
   At the pediatrics unit known as the Ouchless Place at St.
Francis Hospital and Medical Center in Hartford, Conn., the staff
is devoted to making a child's hospital stay as painless as
possible. Blood and other tests are coordinated so kids don't
suffer multiple ``sticks,'' nurses are taught to assess and record
pain, and parents are informed about the use of anesthetics and
given instruction in ways to help children alleviate pain.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the value of a parent's help should never be
underestimated, says Kuttner. She adds, ``Whatever the extent of
the illness or injury, your reassurance is good medicine. In
addition to getting appropriate medical care, simply gathering your
child into your lap, gently rocking her, kissing her and singing a
little song goes a long way toward making her feel better.''

<P>
   Jane M. Healy has spent the past several years peering over the
shoulders of students working in technology-filled classrooms
touted as essential to modern education.
</P>
<P>
   To say she is not impressed is an understatement. The verb
``horrified'' often creeps into the conversation of this petite,
well-mannered woman.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Healy, an educational psychologist and author, has written
a book about children and computers, fleshed out with interviews
with experts, looks at research, discussions of child development
and personal musings. She hopes the book, ``Failure to Connect: How
Computers Affect Our Children's Minds -- For Better and Worse''
(Simon &AMP; Schuster), will embolden parents and educators to begin
asking loud and tough questions about whether the billions of
dollars being spent on wiring schools is a sound investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought computers would be better than television,'' said
Healy, who earlier wrote ``Endangered Minds,'' a book about
television and its effects on children. ``I had high hopes -- and I
came back with huge disillusionment. In fact, I was horrified with
what I saw in schools and people's homes. We have jumped into
(educational technology) way too soon. It's become an idea that has
taken over the public consciousness -- helped, of course, by the
mass promoting of these products to kids as young as a
year-and-a-half.''
</P>
<P>
   It should come as little surprise that classroom technology
enthusiasts think she has it all wrong. Elsie L. Brumback, director
of educational technology at the North Carolina Department of
Public Instruction, believes technology can help students learn
more productively and more deeply. In the right classrooms, she
says, ``students use technology like a sophisticated tool'' to
find, research and synthesize information. ``I've seen that; I've
watched that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And Linda G. Roberts, director of the Office of Educational
Technology at the U.S. Department of Education, says critics like
Healy are overlooking the positive reports of teachers who have
embraced classroom technology. ``We've got almost 10 years
experience in this area,'' she said. ``People are not making this
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, are hoping Healy's book sparks something they
consider long overdue: a national discussion of the role of
computers in education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think her book could actually have an impact,'' said Edward
Miller, a former editor of the Harvard Education Letter and a
critic of many technology-in-education efforts. ``My sense is that
there is a big, untapped reservoir of skepticism about educational
uses of technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman in the center of this is no technophobe. Remedial
technology has worked ``wonders'' for some disabled children and
students with learning disabilities, Healy writes. Her book also
documents what she considers valuable computer-based learning
experiences, among them a sophisticated software program aimed at
getting 9- and 10-year-olds to think about systems theory. And
Healy, a former elementary school principal who was once enthralled
with the classroom possibilities of the first-edition Apple
computer, believes that maybe 50 years from now, technology could
be sophisticated enough to offer invaluable assistance in learning.
</P>
<P>
   But for now there are a lot disheartening patterns in the world
of education and technology, Healy asserts. Among them: constant
classroom computer breakdowns and little technical support; no
thought given to arranging children's computers in a way to reduce
the possibility of vision problems, repetitive motion injuries and
other computer hazards; too ready acceptance of software that is
fun but of dubious educational value, and a lack of research so
deep that teachers are unable to agree on such basics as the best
age to teach a child keyboarding.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Healy is upset that preschoolers are being
urged to log on. Time on the computer might interfere with
development of everything from the young child's motor skills to
his or ability to think logically and distinguish between reality
and fantasy, she writes.
</P>
<P>
   Equally disturbing to Healy was her observation during her
classroom journeys of how computers were often being used by
students. Healy writes of one wealthy private school where students
instructed to use the Internet for research on Latin America devote
their class time to looking up glitzy Web sites about hotels.
``Within a few minutes,'' she writes, ``most of the class is
enthusiastically comparing swimming pools and beds in various
locations.''
</P>
<P>
   In an impoverished inner city school, meanwhile, Healy spent
time in a computer lab, where students were supposed to be
receiving remedial help from educational software.
</P>
<P>
   One boy ``effortlessly solves a few simple addition problems and
then happily accepts his reward -- a series of smash-and-blast
games in which he manages to demolish a sizable number of aliens,''
Healy writes. ``By the time I move on, Raoul has spent many more
minutes zapping aliens than doing math.'' Meanwhile a girl in
desperate need of reading help spends her time at the screen
clicking on colorful animated objects, incapable of reading the few
words in the text, and getting no human assistance in how to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Healy is clearly outraged by such things.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cynical palliative,'' she said. ``I could have taken
either one of those kids and in 15 minutes taught them more than
they would have learned in that computer lab.''
</P>

   The New York Times News Service plans the following
 &UR; ScienceTimes &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, Sept. 29.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ALIEN-HUNTING (Arecibo, Puerto Rico) _ SETI, or the search
for extraterrestrial intelligence, is at a turning point after
nearly four decades of hard work. With the arrival here of a new
crew from the SETI Institute, the field has reached a high point in
terms of telescope sensitivity, a top goal of the alien hunters.
But it has found no extraterrestrials so far, despite forecasts
that they should have been discovered by now. Instead, it has
probed the heavens with regularity and heard nothing but a dead
silence. By William J. Broad Jr. (1875 words)
</P>
<P>
   With locator map.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ANTISENSE (Undated) _ Of all the emerging technologies in
the biotech firmament, few have been so controversial as antisense,
the concept that small snippets of DNA can serve as drugs by
blocking the action of specific genes. With the Food and Drug
Administration's approval last month of the world's first antisense
drug, this technology took a big step forward in critical
acceptance and therapeutic significance. By Lawrence M. Fisher.
(1625 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PREDICTION (Undated) _ When predictions go wrong, serious
problems can result. Some scientists call it ``misplaced
concreteness.'' And whether the problem is climate change,
earthquakes, droughts or floods, they say the tendency to overlook
uncertainties, margins of error and ranges of probability can lead
to damaging misjudgments. William K. Stevens. (1760 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ELDERLY-SEX (Washington) _ New survey on sex habits of the
elderly. By Warren E. Leary.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HAND-TRANSPLANT (Undated) _ An update on the Australian who
received a new hand last week. By Lawrence K. Altman.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BIGHORN-SHEEP (Bishop, Calif.) _ Though some experts
estimate that as little as 2 percent of the vast numbers of
bighorns of the West remain today, wildlife agencies in almost
every Western state have stabilized those numbers in recent years.
But even in states where bighorns are considered to be doing well,
individual herds are prone to catastrophic die-offs, largely from
disease. Some herds may be more susceptible to disease because the
changing Western landscape has left them isolated from other herds.
By Martin Forstenzer. (1400 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VIKING-ARCHEO (Hole, Norway) _ Something is moving inside a
Viking burial mound said to be the ninth century tomb of King
Halvdan the Black. But some archeologists are loath to enter,
warning that whatever is in there could dissolve the spell of
enchantment that helped make Norway a nation. A recent subsidence
in a large, manmade hillock 30 miles northwest of Oslo has set off
a debate over the urgency and propriety of excavating the site to
save what could be the richest archeological cache in Scandinavia.
By Walter Gibbs. (1375 words)
</P>
<P>
   With locator map.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MATERNAL-GENE (Undated) _ Mice know how to take care of
their babies by instinct, meaning that their maternal behavior is
in some way programmed into their genes. Biologists have now
identified one of the genes involved _ one that is sculpted or
imprinted by the father in a way that gives male mice a role in
shaping the female's maternal behavior. Even though human behavior
is far more flexible, a mother's nurturing instincts may take place
within the framework of the same set of genes as exist in mice
because mice and humans are very similar on the genetic level.
Indeed the human version of the mouse gene is also known to be
imprinted by the father. By Nicholas Wade. (900 words)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STANDARD FEATURES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SCI-COMPUTER-COLUMN (Undated) _ A humble-looking chip, about the
size of a postage stamp and no thicker than a nickel promises to
revolutionize security. When attached to a computer, the chip reads
fingerprints with a precision that meets the FBI standards for
personal identification. And while that offers loads of potential
in, say, protecting computer files or locking car doors, it offers
poses threats to privacy. By Rob Fixmer. (1100 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: Memory,
telescopes, comets and faults. (630 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Your science questions answered: On the
making of rayon.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HEALTH PAGE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Malaria, it seems, is gaining ground
annually as control efforts become more costly and cumbersome.
Worldwide there are 300 million to 500 million cases of malaria and
2 million to 3 million deaths from the disease each year. And each
year the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta receives reports of 1,000 to 1,200 cases of malaria that
were acquired abroad but diagnosed in this country. By Jane E.
Brody. (``l'' code) (1400 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   MEDSCHOOL-MINORITIES-HEALTH (Undated) _ Medical authorities,
educators and civil-rights lawyers, concerned about a sudden drop
in minority enrollment at U.S. medical schools, are striking back
at anti-affirmative efforts that they believe have caused the
decline and threaten the future health of minority communities. By
Holcomb B. Noble.
</P>
<P>
   With locator map.
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on health.

 &HT;    SOME SENIORS STILL DO IT, SURVEY FINDS
 &HT;    420&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The good news for middle-aged Baby Boomers: nearly
three out of four sexually active older Americans say sex is as
good or better after 60 as it was in their 40s. The bad news: fewer
than half of all seniors are sexually active.
</P>
<P>
   A national survey on senior sex released Monday by the National
Council on the Aging ``underscores the enduring importance of sex
among older men and women _ even among those who report infrequent
sexual activity,'' said Neal Cutler, research director for the
non-profit education and advocacy group for older Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that about 48 percent of all Americans age 60 or
older are sexually active _ defined as engaging in sexual activity
at least once a month. Among the 52 percent of older Americans who
have sex less than monthly, more than half the men and one-fourth
of the women would like to do it more often.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that about four in 10 respondents would like to
have sex more often, while about the same number are satisfied with
their current level of sexual activity. Only 4 percent said they
wanted less sex. The remainder didn't state an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The survey ``debunks the myths'' that ``older people are not
having sex and are not interested in sex,'' said James Firman,
president of the council.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that 61 percent of older men said they are
sexually active, compared to 37 percent of older women. This gap
results, in part, from the the fact that women generally live
longer than men. Older women are more likely to be widowed and thus
no longer have a sex partner.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the lack of partners is a key reason for sexual
inactivity among older Americans, the survey found. Other reasons
included medical conditions that prevent sex, a partner with a
medical condition that precludes sex, less sexual desire and
medications that reduce sexual desires.
</P>
<P>
   Among respondents who have current sex partners, 61 percent said
their sex life now is either physically more satisfying for
unchanged compared to when they were in their 40s.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 1,300 men and women over the age of 60 was
conducted in June, July and August by Roper Starch Worldwide, a
market research and public opinion firm, and has a margin of error
of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. It was financed by a grant
by Pfizer Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer is the manufacturer of Viagra, an anti-impotence drug,
but Firman said the grant was ``unrestricted'' and the survey was
composed before Viagra reached the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   At a Washington press conference, Cutler said the survey will
provide a benchmark for future studies.
</P>
<P>
   Research on the sex lives of older Americans is woefully
lacking, said Marian Dunn, director of the Center for Human
Sexuality in the Psychiatry Department of the State University of
New York in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Young people often have a difficult time believing that their
parents and grandparents are sexually active, she said. And older
people are often equally uniformed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A third of our respondents believed it was natural to lose
interest in sex as they got older,'' she said. Often the problem is
as simple as changing a medicine had an unwanted side effect of
decreasing sexual desire or realizing that the wife may have to
help her aging husband obtain an erection.
</P>
<P>
   But times are changing, she said. Twenty years ago, it was rare
for people over 60 to seek help from her center, but now a third of
its patients are in this age group.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that sexual activity does decrease with age,
with men and women in their 60s more sexually active than those in
their 70s.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps realistically, older Americans put ``attractive body
shape'' well down on the list of desirable attributes they seek in
a romantic partner. The top attributes are an ``honest, high moral
character'' and ``pleasant personality,'' followed in order by a
good sense of humor, similar interests, intelligence, good health,
financial security, religious observance, ``able to have sex,''
``likes to have sex,'' attractive face and eyes, attractive body
shape, culturally sophisticated and high social status.

NATIVE AMERICAN EXPLORES THE ROOTS OF FAMILY'S TROUBLED PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL GRONDAHL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Joseph Bruchac has taken the source of a shameful
childhood secret and reimagined it as the stuff of literature,
laying the foundation for a family industry along the way.
</P>
<P>
   In his memoir, ``Bowman's Store: A Journey to Myself'' (Dial
Books, 1997, $16.99), Bruchac reveals his family's unspoken pact
never to prod his grandfather about his dark skin or to discuss
what he much later learned was Grampa's hidden Abenaki blood.
</P>
<P>
   There were other mysteries for Bruchac growing up with his
grandparents at their general store and gas station in Greenfield
Center, N.Y. Why didn't Bruchac live with his parents, whose house
was just down the road? And why was his family so divided and
ashamed about its Native American heritage?
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of family secrets and divisions that took a
long time to understand and to heal,'' Bruchac said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruchac, 55, began to ponder his family's troubled past in his
poetry and prose as he explored his Abenaki roots. In 1971, Bruchac
published his first poetry collection, ``Indian Mountain,'' and his
latest book of poems, ``No Borders,'' due out this fall, continues
to interpret the terrain of Native American ways. In between,
Bruchac has published dozens of books, ranging from children's
stories to novels to anthologies of Indian tales.
</P>
<P>
   Bruchac's new novel, ``The Waters Between,'' is set in an
Abenaki community on Lake Champlain and completes a trilogy that
consists of ``Dawn Land'' (1993) and ``Long River'' (1995).
</P>
<P>
   Bruchac also will trace how Native American storytelling and
literature has become a family affair. The Bruchacs live in the
farmhouse and work in the attached gas station and general store,
which has since been converted into an office, where Bruchac was
raised by his grandparents in the '40s and '50s.
</P>
<P>
   Bruchac and his wife of 34 years, Carol Bruchac, are co-editors
and co-publishers of The Greenfield Review Press, which specializes
in books on Native American themes. Their sons, Jim, 30, and Jesse,
26, work with the family publishing concern and are both
professional storytellers like their father.
</P>
<P>
   Bruchac and Jim recently performed at the Corn Island
Storytelling Festival in Louisville, Ky., while Bruchac and Jesse
were featured at the recent Dodge Poetry Festival in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Bruchac's mother, Marion Bowman Bruchac, 78, confined to a
wheelchair, lives just down the road and the Bruchacs share the
responsibility of taking care of her needs.
</P>
<P>
   The entire family assists with a program Bruchac's sons
established, Ndakinna Project, a series of workshops on Native
American philosophy, animal tracking, shelter-building and other
ancient skills held on a 100-acre wildlife preserve in Greenfield
Center the Bruchacs own. Ndakinna means ``our land'' in the Abenaki
language.
</P>
<P>
   Bruchac's literary journey began, in a sense, with travel. In
the late 1960s, Bruchac and his wife spent three years as teachers
in the wilderness of Ghana in west Africa. The isolation spurred
Bruchac's writing and he mailed poems to literary journals back in
the States, where his first work was published.
</P>
<P>
   The couple then started their own literary magazine in Ghana,
The Greenfield Review, which operated from 1970 to 1987. It
developed a strong emphasis on indigenous cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Bruchac's timing was right.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a rebirth of interest in Native American ways
and in all kinds of storytelling,'' Bruchac said. ``I've been
fortunate to grow with that. I've gone from publishers rejecting my
proposals for books to having publishers coming to me with book
proposals. I'm in a wonderful position to be able to choose the
projects I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruchac is working to pass his knowledge of Native American
wisdom to the next generation. He is a frequent storyteller and
writing teacher in schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gratifying to see children get excited about stories and
writing,'' Bruchac said. ``I get letters from kids around the
country saying my books got them interested in Native American
traditions. That makes it worthwhile.''

CONGRESS ASSAILS CLINTON RESCUE PLAN FOR RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For days, top officials of the Clinton
administration have spoken in soothing tones about a rescue plan
for Russia. Loans, investment, and a generous dose of good will can
help the country recover from its crisis, they suggest.
</P>
<P>
   But the vague strategy has met with criticism from analysts and
outright ridicule from Democrats and Republicans alike in Congress.
Even some administration officials who watch Russia concede that
Russia is abandoning a market economy, curbing its fight against
corruption, and rebuffing other prescriptions from Americans.
</P>
<P>
   More troubling, several of the officials admit that Washington
has not promoted over the past few years the right medicine for
Russia's growing economic, political, social, and environmental
ills.
</P>
<P>
   The vast gulf between the administration's upbeat public
pronouncements and the glum forecasts of academics, business
executives, and members of Congress has been clear this month as
one Senate and House committee after another has explored Russia's
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical reprimand earlier this month, Representative
Benjamin Gilman, a New York Republican who chairs the House
International Relations Committee, publicly scolded two of the
administration's Russia experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe our government has not only been lied to by
high-level Russian officials, but has ignored important signals
over the last few years that all is not well, both in Russia and in
our relationship with its government,'' Gilman told Lawrence
Summers, deputy secretary of the Treasury, and Strobe Talbott,
deputy secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can Russia change when the success story of our foreign
policy which was portrayed by our administration just two years ago
has turned into the dismal failure of our foreign policy that it
appears to be today?''
</P>
<P>
   Such remarks are hardly limited to Republicans. A few minutes
later, Lee Hamilton, the top-ranking Democrat on the committee,
chimed in, ``The mood in Congress ... is sour towards Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's transformation from Cold War enemy to stable democratic
partner was to be the Clinton administration's great foreign
triumph.
</P>
<P>
   The administration supported President Boris N. Yeltsin when he
sent tanks to pummel Parliament in 1993 and when he masterminded a
disastrous 20-month war in the breakaway province of Chechnya that
cost almost 100,000 lives. The White House justified its support
because Yeltsin and his ``energetic young reformers'' were working
to achieve the political transformation of the century.
</P>
<P>
   But the new prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, has shown an
interest in Soviet-style central planning, price controls and
currency restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Primakov rose to power two weeks ago, Congress was
already angry because a $4.8 billion loan from the International
Monetary Fund, endorsed by the Clinton administration, did little
more than prop up the ruble temporarily and make money for a small
group of speculators.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF had planned to send Russia the rest of a loan that
totals $22.6 billion, but the next installments have been postponed
because Russia is in default to foreign creditors who hold $40
billion in treasury bills and other instruments. The Clinton
administration says Russia must do more to curb inflation, protect
investors, collect taxes, and establish laws that work before
getting more loans, but the administration has not specified
exactly how far Russia must go to reach these goals or how long it
should be given.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying before the International Relations Committee, Dmitri
Simes, president of the Nixon Center, warned, ``We should be
prepared to refuse to throw good money after bad. We should start
developing an exit strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Simes hinted that the United States might have to consider
disengaging from Russia and letting Moscow founder on its own, a
tactic that would have been unthinkable from a serious scholar just
a few years ago. ``We have to face the facts and be ready for any
eventuality, as unpleasant as it may be,'' Simes said.
</P>
<P>
   Such pessimism contrasts with the administration approach that
is based on active engagement with Moscow. Summers told Congress
earlier this month that the US government will agree to resume IMF
loans ``when we can be confident that that support will be well
used.'' And Talbott, who has visited Russia twice in the past five
weeks, warned against turning away from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``To disengage would be to give up on it,'' he said. ``To brace
ourselves for a crash of Russia would be to increase the chances
that the crash would occur.''
</P>
<P>
   In private, officials admit they fear chaos in Russia, no matter
what Washington does. A widely respected official in Washington,
who can talk comfortably about bridge loans and NATO cooperation,
recently was asked what the United States should do about Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Panic,'' he responded.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been holding high-level meetings for five
weeks on the issue. The meetings are usually held at the Treasury
Department or the White House, and are led by National Security
Adviser Samuel R. Berger or Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin,
Summers, or David A. Lipton, the Treasury undersecretary for
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   One senior US official said that Primakov understands that
Russia cannot turn away from the United States or recklessly print
money. But he added, ``We have to to be realistic about all of the
pressures for Russia to head in the wrong direction.''
</P>
<P>
   With the support of the Communist-dominated Parliament, Primakov
has named two senior economic officials, First Deputy Prime
Minister Yury Maslyukov and Central Bank chairman Viktor
Gerashchenko, who have proposed printing rubles to pay Russia's
debts, a policy that most specialists say will lead quickly to
hyperinflation.
</P>
<P>
   Maslyukov, a moderate Communist who once headed the Soviet state
planning agency, also has proposed government support of Russia's
massive and insolvent defense industries.
</P>
<P>
   As the Soviet Central Bank chief in 1991, Gerashchenko oversaw a
Draconian currency reform that erased the savings of millions. He
also served as Russia's top banker from 1992 to 1994, when
inflation soared. Jeffrey Sachs, the Harvard economics professor
who advised the Russian government in 1992, once called
Gerashchenko ``the world's worst central banker.''
</P>
<P>
   Such judgments do little to bolster faith in Russia's new team
of economists. But many in Congress, from Alabama conservative
Republican Spencer Bachus to Vermont's iconoclastic liberal Bernard
Sanders, are convinced that Washington's solutions have not worked
for Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Bachus, Sanders, and others on the House Banking
oversight subcommittee received some advice from Boris Kagarlitsky,
an adviser to the State Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament.
``If there is one thing we need from the West now,'' Kagarlitsky
said, ``it is for them to leave us in peace.''

THE GRAVITY OF PRINT, THE `POP' OF TV 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN and MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The day after Bill Clinton's grand jury testimony was beamed
into our homes, front-page newspaper stories assessed his
performance. The Washington Post said he'd ``vigorously defended
himself'' while The New York Times declared him ``irate and sad.''
In the Globe, he was ``animated.''
</P>
<P>
   But those post-mortems were largely a moot point for the 23
million Americans who had watched the televised testimony. ``Once
you show people 5 to 10 minutes of the real stuff, unedited,'' said
Steven Bill, founder of Court TV and an expert on the court of
public opinion, ``they think they know a lot.'' And they don't need
a headline to tell them which way the wind's blowing.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton testimony marked another pivotal day in a scandal
that has redrawn the relationship between old and new media and
most significantly, between the gravity of the printed page and the
visceral pop of the television screen. In short, despite a
temporary jump in newspaper sales, the primacy of television became
even harder to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Like most major stories, the saga of the president and the
intern had its beginnings in print. Like all major stories in the
late 20th century, it will likely have its ending, or at least its
defining moments, on television.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis de Tocqueville, whom Bill Clinton is fond of quoting,
wrote in 1835 that ``scarcely any political question arises in the
United States that is not resolved, sooner or later, into a
judicial question.'' In 1998, scarcely any political question
arises in the United States that is not resolved, sooner or later,
into a TV spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows this better than Clinton, who played the saxophone
on ``The Arsenio Hall Show'' as a candidate in 1992, the same year
he slam-dunked George Bush during a ``town hall'' debate whose
format favored the TV-friendly Clinton. One endlessly replayed
television picture _ of Clinton hugging Monica Lewinsky at a
meet-the-public event _ has been worth many thousands of words
throughout this scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Many damning words have been written about Clinton in the
nation's leading newspapers. (To date, about 170 papers have called
for him to leave office.) But it may be that the print media never
stood a chance against a president who is the most sophisticated TV
personality of the age, a Johnny Carson-like maestro of the medium.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's better to be lucky than good, and Clinton, the
talk-show president, may be the lucky beneficiary of the
Oprahfication of America.
</P>
<P>
   Infidelity? Office hanky-panky? Phone sex? Cigars, even? Old-hat
yawners to the millions who tune in daily to ``The Jerry Springer
Show'' or ``Sally Jessy Raphael'' or ``Montel Williams.'' On a
typical day, the soap operas that were preempted Monday by the
networks are racier than the Clinton testimony ballyhooed as
``salacious'' by political pundits.
</P>
<P>
   US Rep. Edward J. Markey, the ranking Democrat on the House
Telecommunications subcommittee, says he believes the nation
brought the assumptions of television to the experience of watching
their president testify about sex in a legal setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got `Law and Order,' `L.A. Law,' `The Practice,' `Ally
McBeal,'' said Markey. ``It was the cumulative course-load of
having gone to TV law school, combined with their ability to
evaluate the guests on morning talk shows, which they all applied
to determining whether the president should pay with his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``They walked away with the common-sense decision that they
did not find an impeachable offense,'' concluded Markey.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the cultural context in which Clinton operates is his own
remarkable fluency in the idiom of television. That skill was
evident again during his grand jury testimony, as he made clear
that he suspected ``this unprecedented videotape'' would be
eventually leaked and televised.
</P>
<P>
   His resort to tortured, legalistic evasion has been much mocked
by pundits, who seemed to barely notice the way Clinton maintained
sympathetic eye contact with the camera, and the way he adroitly
crafted sound bites for the larger TV audience as he was being
grilled: ``There's some kind of gotcha game in this deposition.''
``I'm not going to answer your trick questions.'' ``You
(prosecutors) have made this the most important issue in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton has seen enough courtroom melodramas on TV to know
how the beleaguered good guy is supposed to sound on the witness
stand. Television's tried-and-true entertainment values surrounded
this production; during one break in the action, CNN's Greta van
Sustern, sounding for all the world like Dan Dierdorf diagraming a
play on ``Monday Night Football,'' told viewers: ``Here we see
prosecutors trying to set a trap.''
</P>
<P>
   If ``Monica-gate'' has boiled down to made-for-TV sport, that's
one clear way in which it differs from Watergate. That scandal,
driven by two obscure Washington Post reporters, was an
old-fashioned print press story.
</P>
<P>
   Yet from the outset, the ink-stained wretches had a slippery
grip on the first presidential scandal of the modern media era.
Newsweek's Michael Isikoff may have done the hard work needed to
break the Lewinsky scoop back in January. But when Newsweek briefly
held the story, it was hijacked onto the Internet by Matt Drudge
and filtered into the Beltway buzz machine by a Sunday morning TV
talk show.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers believe that chain of events symbolized print's
inability to keep pace with a saga nurtured by a feverish media
culture dominated by 24-hour cable news channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an Internet and cable TV story,'' said Steven
Stark, author of ``Glued to the Set,'' a history of influential
television shows. ``Cable television has kept the story alive for
months and has been hooked on it. ... What you're looking for is a
soap opera.''
</P>
<P>
   In one telling poll taken by the Media Studies Center early this
year, 68 percent of the respondents said they were getting most of
their Lewinsky-related information from television while only 13
percent cited newspapers. A year earlier, when people were asked
were about the source of most of their news, the split was 50
percent television and 24 percent newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in some ways, this distasteful matter has lifted all boats
in the media pool. The Sept. 11 release of Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr's report proved a major boon for a newspaper industry
that was actually better equipped to handle the steamy sexual
material in somber-looking reprints than were the harried
television reporters trying to decide which dirty words were fit
for afternoon TV.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a Pew Research Center survey revealed that of the 48
percent of the public that had read or heard at least part of the
Starr report, 28 percent got that information from newspapers and
only 15 percent were tuned into the television set. The
Philadelphia Inquirer edition that contained the report saw a
stunning increase of 140,000 single-copy sales; the Los Angeles
Times sold an extra 64,000 papers; and Chicago Tribune sales of
that paper were up by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were chary about putting (the Starr report) on the
air,'' noted presidential historian Henry Graff. The Starr report
``enabled the mainline instruments of communication to be
pornographic. ... We've revived the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   That phenomenon notwithstanding, newspapers aren't built to
compete with the instant gratification medium of television. And
many observers think that in a story of this nature, it's a mistake
to try. Print's role is not to replicate television's instantaneous
power, but to bring some depth and context to the dizzying whir of
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an enormous opportunity for print to be the clarifying
medium, if they'll do it,'' said Jon Katz, media critic for Rolling
Stone magazine. ``I think that people who care about the civic life
of the country would flock to a medium they trust. ... They're a
perfect antidote to all this insanity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say the newspapers have delivered the most even-handed
balanced coverage, but in this accelerating culture, print is
always behind the Internet and television,'' added Stark. ``Eighty
percent of the public wants context and balance. But the problem is
that everyone is competing for that other 20 percent.''

WATCHING OTHERS' NET SEARCHING

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Most of us have a bit of voyeur inside, don't you
think?
</P>
<P>
   Have you been glued to the television for the past few months
watching the Clinton scandal unfold? Do you slow down and gawk
while passing a traffic accident? Was ``Candid Camera'' one of your
favorite television shows?
</P>
<P>
   Ok, here's another test: Check out this site and see if it
interests you:  &UR; webcrawler.com/SearchTicker.html (There is no
``www'' at the beginning.)
</P>
<P>
   That's where you'll find something called the WebCrawler Search
Voyeur. Call me weird, but I find it fascinating!
</P>
<P>
   WebCrawler, as you might know, is a popular search site on the
Web. The Search Voyeur is a window into actual searches being
conducted by people using the site.
</P>
<P>
   Call up the Search Voyeur page, and a Java applet opens (which
means you'll need one of the latest versions of Navigator or
Internet Explorer). The window displays a continuously scrolling
list of keywords and phrases people are plugging in to WebCrawler
to find stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Like I said, it's really fascinating. My only complaint is the
speed at which the list scrolls across your screen. Watch it for a
few minutes, and your eyes will get buggy!
</P>
<P>
   But it's fun to see what people are searching for and how they
are using WebCrawler.
</P>
<P>
   One minute I saw ``planets AND solar AND system'' fly by (some
kid doing his homework?), and the next minute I saw ``new AND york
AND mets'' (a fan?) and ``clinton scandals'' (no doubt a
Republican).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's more than a few people looking for
pornography. I won't reproduce the keywords they used here,
although some of them will make you laugh out loud. And there are
people who don't have a clue how search engines work. Someone
recently typed in: ``tell me how to find the nearest pizza
parlor.''
</P>
<P>
   Fairly often, some poor soul types in a complete Web address,
such as `` &UR; www.sony.com'' or `` &UR; www.microsoft.com.'' If they know
the address, why are they searching for it? Another possibility is
that some people must think that's what you must do to reach a
particular site.
</P>
<P>
   The searches are all anonymous. WebCrawler points out that more
than 5 million people use the site each day to search for
something. That's way too many for anyone to possibly link an
individual with one of the searches that flies across your screen
on the Search Voyeur.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a cool feature: If you see an interesting search scroll
by, you can click on it with your mouse. WebCrawler will present
you with the results of that search, as if you had conducted it
yourself! Better be quick, though. As I said, the list scrolls by
at top speed.
</P>
<P>
   Want to check out a different type of search voyeur? Find it at
 &UR; www.mcinley.com. It's the site of the Magellan Internet Guide,
another ``jumping off'' and search site for Web users.
</P>
<P>
   The Magellan search voyeur presents 12 randomly selected
searches that people are conducting at that moment. The list
refreshes every few seconds. Watching the list is similar to
watching the Search Voyeur at WebCrawler, but it's easier on the
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Check them out! &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Computers that fit
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, I wrote about my wish for ``computers that
fit,'' or small computer appliances that fit different rooms of
your home and could run off a central ``home server,'' a powerful
PC or Macintosh somewhere in the house.
</P>
<P>
   I complained that the average computer today is one basic design
_ a desktop box or tower, a keyboard, a mouse and a bulky monitor.
Those setups just don't work in the kitchen or any other room where
you don't have lots of counter space and room for a tangle of
wires.
</P>
<P>
   Since I wrote the column, I've heard from several readers on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   Several pointed out that uniquely designed computers are
available for industry. I knew that. But those systems are not
practical for home use, primarily because they often cost thousands
of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   I also heard from someone connected with a Phoenix company
called INVNSYS Technology Corp. The company is designing and making
computer systems with smaller footprints. One model they produce
takes up less than a square foot of counter or desk space. Now
that's more along the lines of what I was talking about!
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, I heard from Intel Corp., which has a number of
people focused on advancing the design and manufacturing of
portable computing devices that operate via radio frequencies.
Presumably, that would allow home-computing appliances to be spread
all over the place without the need for wires.
</P>
<P>
   If you are interested in learning more about the radio frequency
idea, check out this Web site:  &UR; www.homerf.org/. Be forewarned
though: It's a Web site geared toward computer engineers and much
of the content might make your eyes glaze over! &QL;

CONSTITU TIONAL PROCESS SHOULD MOVE FOR WARD  
 (THIS EDITORIAL APPEARED IN THE SEPT. 27 ARIZONA REPUBLIC) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Resignation under pressure? Formal censure? A fine,
perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, newspaper editorial pages and Main Street
America, the search is on for a painless way to acknowledge the
severity of Bill Clinton's transgressions and put his scandal
behind us, while avoiding the national trauma and political risk of
exercising a long-unused presidential impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   We ought to quit looking, and return to the most reliable guide
in such matters _ the U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   No one _ certainly not the Founding Fathers _ ever said
displacing a president should be painless. Maintaining a healthy
democracy was meant to require sweat, hard work and tough
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The alternatives to impeachment now in vogue in the ongoing
national debate are extra-constitutional procedures that weren't
recognized by the wise men in Philadelphia as legitimate means for
righting an executive's wrongful course. Although none is expressly
prohibited by the charter, we ought not stray _ without compelling
reasons _ beyond the founders' language when it already provides a
serviceable process for replacing disgraced leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Take resignation. To be sure, there may be instances of
incapacity where quitting is in order, and it may yet become
appropriate to Clinton's growing dilemma, especially if his public
support erodes significantly.
</P>
<P>
   But those instances must properly remain within the president's
discretion and not be forced upon him. Only if it is performed
voluntarily, in a spirit of contrition and national interest, can
it have any healing power. (A resignation today, for example, would
surely include tirades at Ken Starr, a ``right-wing conspiracy''
and assorted demons.)
</P>
<P>
   Forcing a second presidential resignation in a quarter-century
could raise troubling questions of precedent, and come to be
regarded as a pain-free way of driving out unpopular presidents.
This might leave the office under an enduring cloud of uncertainty,
and sap the ``energy in the executive'' seen as so essential by
Hamilton and his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the resignation debate may be moot, since the
self-absorbed Clinton appears determined to stay put. ``Saving his
skin at all costs,'' noted the ``Economist,'' ``has become the
theme of his political career.''
</P>
<P>
   As for censure, which has gained ground recently as a
middle-road answer to America's leadership crisis, it is even less
satisfying than resignation, for it solves nothing. A figurative
rap on the president's knuckles might sate Congress' aversion to
heavy political lifting, but it would leave him in place with his
moral authority further impaired.
</P>
<P>
   The founders devised impeachment not as a form of punishment but
as an instrument of rescue, a way to spare the nation from the
baleful consequences of a president's past and future excesses.
</P>
<P>
   While we reject the notion that Clinton's premature departure
would be automatically ``destabilizing'' to America (after all, it
has already happened nine times in 41 presidencies without
disastrous effect), we believe its timing could prove critical. And
opinion polls suggest there is nothing yet approaching a national
consensus on the president's fate, as there clearly was by the time
Richard Nixon finally departed 24 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Resolving our current trauma shouldn't come at the expense of a
calibrated constitutional process. Nor should its primary aim be to
spare the political class of hard decisions, or citizens of their
duty to guide those choices.
</P>
<P>
   You will find no defense here for President Clinton. He has
demeaned his office, lied to (not ``misled'') the American people,
violated the laws he swore to protect, and now flails about in an
ethical swamp of his own making in a futile effort to pretend that
the nation's business, especially abroad, is in confident hands.
</P>
<P>
   The president was right on Aug. 17. It (begin ital) is (end
ital) time to ``get on with our national life . . . to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``moving on'' must not mean (begin ital) ignoring (end ital)
the ethical, legal and constitutional problems of Clinton's making.
Rather, we must deal with them honestly and openly, and come to a
conclusion consistent with our moral values and the future health
of the political process, and commanding the support of most
Americans. &QL;

terms of telescope sensitivity, a top goal of the alien hunters.

But even in states where bighorns are considered to be doing well,
individual herds are prone to catastrophic die-offs, largely from

enchantment that helped make Norway a nation. A recent subsidence
in a large, manmade hillock 30 miles northwest of Oslo has set off

in some way programmed into their genes. Biologists have now
identified one of the genes involved _ one that is sculpted or
imprinted by the father in a way that gives male mice a role in
shaping the female's maternal behavior. Even though human behavior
is far more flexible, a mother's nurturing instincts may take place
within the framework of the same set of genes as exist in mice
because mice and humans are very similar on the genetic level.

N.J. TOWN'S PLAN FOR INDIAN CASINO LOOKS LIKE A BAD GAMBLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By TONY FREEMANTLE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILDWOOD, N.J. _ It took awhile, but Fred G. Wager, the mayor of
this fading resort on the southern New Jersey coast, finally got
the American Indians from Oklahoma to take him seriously.
</P>
<P>
   After all, his was an attractive proposition.
</P>
<P>
   He would restore to the Delaware tribe of western Oklahoma a
portion of the land their ancestors occupied before they were
evicted by the white man and would allow them to build a casino in
his town. They would make millions and Wildwood would be rescued
from the brink of economic ruin. It was, he tried to convince the
tribe, a win-win situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trouble with the Native Americans,'' Wager said, ``is they
were so mistreated that they don't trust us at all. They'll say
that to your face. I had a hard time getting them to warm up to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   But warm up they did, and after a local election gave him the
go-ahead, Wager signed a deal in 1995 with tribal leader Larry
Snake. Indian gaming, the elixir of declining fortunes, was coming
to Wildwood, easy as pie.
</P>
<P>
   Or so the mayor thought. But there were fatal variables in the
equation that he and his supporters had not accounted for, and
three years later the deal has unraveled into a contentious
three-way court battle with the stakes considerably higher than a
small casino in Wildwood.
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost is the fact that the 2.5 square acres of
asphalt parking lot in the middle of Wildwood that Wager offered
the tribe is but a fraction of the area the Delawares now feel they
have a right to. The tribe, which apparently had no designs on
Wildwood until the mayor raised the issue, has since filed suit in
federal court for the whole city of 4,442 permanent residents and
is threatening to seek thousands of additional acres.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, the state of New Jersey has resolved to block
Wildwood's attempts to get its casino, citing state laws against
such facilities anywhere other than in Atlantic City, 30 miles to
the north. Laws regulating what a municipality may do with its
boundaries have also come into play.
</P>
<P>
   Just how much the state's position is influenced by the
developers of the monster resorts to the north is unclear, but
legislators from there have been vocal in their opposition.
</P>
<P>
   And the federal government, which is reluctant to permit Native
American tribes to open houses of gambling on land outside of their
reservations, declared the deal dead.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Wager and his ``renaissance'' team should have stuck to
their original idea of a ``zeppelin casino'' in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   No one from the Delaware tribe would return calls, so their
motives can only be surmised. But it is probably safe to say that
money plays a part.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe occupies a portion of Oklahoma anchored by the small
town of Anadarko. It already operates a small casino there, but it
is a long way from the cash cow other Indian gambling venues have
become.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 200 tribes run gaming operations, earning them $7 billion
a year, and for some, the infusion of cash into their impoverished
communities has brought about unprecedented prosperity. And like
bees to the honey jar, non-Indian communities, like Wildwood, want
a slice of the action by offering land to tribes looking for viable
venues for casinos.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey coast, with its proximity to Baltimore,
Philadelphia and New York, is a lot more economically attractive
than western Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not as easy as it seems.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of the Interior and its Bureau of Indian
Affairs has only once allowed a tribe to place land into trust for
the purposes of establishing a gambling operation _ in Wisconsin in
1991. That was an instance in which everyone _ the tribe, the
state, the local community, the federal government _ were in
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn D. McGogney, an attorney for the tribe and a partner in an
Indian casino financing operation in Allentown, Pa., said the
Delaware's federal suit, which he filed earlier this month, was
based on the Federal Nonintercourse Act of 1790, which essentially
stated that Native American tribes could not transfer land without
the approval of Congress. In 1820, the state of New Jersey bought
out all Indian land claims, but the deal was never sanctioned by
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Wager's ambitions may have been modest when he embarked on
his quest for a casino _ all he wanted, he said, was a small
operation that would bring in a mere $8 million a year for the
city. But he may have awakened a slumbering giant, setting in
motion a process that could, in the end, cost him, his town and the
state a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   The Delawares are no longer ``friendly'' to Wildwood or the
state. If New Jersey insists on blocking them, they have threatened
to press claims to all the land they once occupied in the state,
which could amount to thousands of acres.
</P>
<P>
   What has the state worried is that the Delaware tribal claim has
precedents. Several tribes have successfully sued for the return of
their lands in various states, including the Passamaquoddy and
Penobscot Indians of Maine, who in 1972 sued for the return of more
than a million acres and settled for $81.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Delaware tribe's claim is based on archaeological and
historical research that shows them as descendants of the Lenape
Indians, who lived along the Delaware River nearly 400 years ago in
what is now New Jersey, Delaware and New York. The tribe that
became known as the Delaware occupied land mostly between Atlantic
City and Wilmington, Del.
</P>
<P>
   In its lawsuit in Camden, N.J., the tribe claims that Wildwood
was the site of their hunting and fishing grounds until white
settlers took possession of the land.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Attorney General Peter Verniero would not comment on
any possible land claims by the Delaware. But on the question of a
casino in Wildwood, he is unequivocal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the city of Wildwood) are trying to do something that is
illegal under state law,'' Verniero said. ``We have a duty to
enforce the laws of the state and, in my mind, the city of Wildwood
is running afoul of state law.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Verniero argues that Wildwood is enjoined from
transferring public property to the Delaware Tribe without approval
of the Legislature and that it lacks the authority to cede
sovereignty over the property to the tribe. Furthermore, the state
constitution prohibits gambling anywhere in the state besides
Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   On a federal level, Verniero said, the government also needs the
approval of the state's governor before it can place land in trust
for the purposes of Indian gaming, and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman
has said she will not give her approval.
</P>
<P>
   Verniero maintains that as far as he knows the state's position
is not being influenced by political pressure from the casino
owners in Atlantic City, but Mayor Wager believes otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a classic David and Goliath battle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And a powerful representative for Atlantic City, state Sen.
William L. Gormley has openly derided Wager as ``an embarrassment''
to the state's other municipal officials.
</P>
<P>
   Wager insists his motives are pure. Whenever he is asked to talk
about his ``field of dreams,'' he summons his two businessmen
friends _ motel owner Bill Gannon and John Nickels, the owner of a
boardwalk amusement park _ to help him flesh out the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got 26 percent unemployment; 35 percent of our families are
below the poverty line,'' Wager says. ``When our kids graduate from
high school they leave town. We have boarded up businesses in the
heart of downtown. We're not looking to compete with Atlantic City.
We're just trying to save our town.''
</P>
<P>
   Wager concedes that the odds are stacked against him, but he
isn't ready to give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm optimistic that we can work this out,'' Wager said. ``I'm
going to do what I can to fix the economy of this city, and in the
process maybe we can do something for the Delaware tribe, because
we do owe a debt to the Native Americans. And I mean that
sincerely.''

 &HT;    Commentary: Let sleeping dogs lie
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I recently I re-entered the workforce full time. It was a
re-entry reminiscent of Apollo 13.
</P>
<P>
   I thought I was ready. I thought I was prepared. Now I don't
think at all. I'm too tired.
</P>
<P>
   My new and continual state of exhaustion, however, has led to an
interesting rapport with one of our dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Let me tell you about Striper, our not-so-beloved pet that
closely resembles a New York City sewer rat. The description
matches both her appearance and personality.
</P>
<P>
   I don't like this dog, and quite frankly, she doesn't like me.
We've tried to appreciate one another's good points over the years,
but to no avail. My excuse is easy: She has no good points.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, we manage to peacefully co-exist. We've had our
run-ins, though, like the time she curled up her scrawny body on my
bed comforter, a place she knew was forbidden. Then there was the
time we accidentally left her outside all night. The next day, we
found her thank-you note smack dab in the middle of the living room
rug. She disobeys with malice aforethought.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, we have developed an uneasy understanding in the
14 years she's been with us.
</P>
<P>
   She slinks into a room she knows she's not supposed to be in,
her head down and tail between her legs, her eyes cast up and
sideways toward me to see if I notice.
</P>
<P>
   I notice. I growl at her; she growls at me. We know each other
well.
</P>
<P>
   I've actually tried to give this dog away at least three
different times. The first time it even worked for a few weeks. We
gave her to a neighborhood girl who was desperately lonely and
wanted a pet. Her mother approved, so I happily packed up Striper's
food, bowls and leash and placed her in the little girl's arms.
``Bye, you sneaky little rat,'' I said, cheerfully waving her away.
</P>
<P>
   It just didn't take, though. Every day, Striper showed up at our
front door, waiting for us to take her back in. I held out until
the day she showed up with purple polish on her toenails and
reeking of cheap perfume. Even I could understand the extreme
humiliation in her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   We took her back, which was OK with the little girl because she
had found another pet that she liked better. Not surprising. A pet
rock has more redeeming qualities.
</P>
<P>
   The next time I tried to give her to our niece, who was
attending college nearby and had an apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aren't you lonely? Don't you want a sweet little companion to
curl up with you at night? Look at her face. Isn't she a dear?'' I
wheedled, lying blatantly.
</P>
<P>
   We both looked at Striper, who chose that moment to start
hacking and carrying on like a Milk Bone was lodged in her throat.
Our niece passed on pet ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Then, I just basically tried to give her to anyone who showed
even mild interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, what a cute little dog,'' a neighbor out for an evening
walk would say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Want her?'' I'd ask.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever did. So, she's ours. And these days, she and I are
getting along a lot better.
</P>
<P>
   I drag in from work at night, my head hanging and my tail
between my legs and I look at her with new empathy.
</P>
<P>
   I circle the cookie jar three times and then flop in the nearest
chair. With her grizzled and graying mug, her cataract-coated eyes,
and the slow, crippled way she rises from a prone position, I know
that we have more in common than I ever dreamed possible.
</P>
<P>
   These days, I'll occasionally let Striper on my lap at night.
She'll doze off and sigh contentedly as if we're old friends. I
guess sleeping dogs do lie.

AMERICANS THINKING OF OTHER THINGS BESIDES CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whatever President Clinton's sins and indiscretions, a growing
majority of Americans appear to feel that he, and they, have been
punished enough.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the four-hour televised grilling of Clinton
by a hostile battery of grand jury prosecutors seems to have
backfired. The broadcast would have been unprecedentedly demeaning
for any chief executive. Immediately after witnessing Clinton's
responses, the already substantial majority against impeachment
went up six points in at least one poll. A solid two-thirds now
back the president.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what they may think of Clinton personally, most
say they're tired of the prolonged investigation and don't want to
hear any more about the tawdry sex affair.
</P>
<P>
   Most believe that the president did wrong but don't believe he
should be impeached. They feel there are more important subjects
for Congress to consider and want their lawmakers to get on with
the nation's business. That's what people are telling pollsters.
</P>
<P>
   The overpowering tragedy of the shabby scandal that has
dominated Washington this entire year transcends the personal grief
that its persistent focus has visited upon the principals and their
families. Far worse is the injury that our preoccupation with the
sordid subject inflicts on the nation. It has affronted the public
taste, cheapened the national dialogue, drowned out other important
information, and polarized Congress into hostile, bitter, partisan
camps.
</P>
<P>
   Real harm has resulted from the yearlong absence of any serious
congressional attention to a host of genuine national problems. The
noisome babble that fills almost every news broadcast obscures a
mounting backlog of unattended public business.
</P>
<P>
   Obsessed with their incessant game of political ``gotcha!,''
congressional leaders have managed to shirk doing anything about
important national needs that affect people's lives. Here are a few
of those real problems ignored by newscasters, commentators and
lawmakers while they've chattered, trance-like, about Monicagate:
</P>
<P>
   _ Alarming stock market plunges and sharp currency devaluations
in Japan, Russia and much of the developing world. These are
impoverishing millions and drying up America's foreign markets. If
long unattended, they could bring on a worldwide economic
depression from which America could not immunize itself.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the 1930s, when economic panics gave impetus to the
rise of military dictatorships, including those of Adolf Hitler,
Benito Mussolini and Josef Stalin?
</P>
<P>
   _ The looming crisis in the Social Security trust fund, about
which we've been duly warned. This crisis is preventable if we act
soon enough. The best possible time would be in this moment of
budget surplus. But all year long this subject has been ignored by
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   _ The negotiated tobacco settlement, now moribund. It offered a
fleeting chance, and some needed revenues, to begin protecting the
nation's youth from tobacco's addictive menace. Congressional
leaders, mindful of tobacco company contributions and apparently
mesmerized by the tobacco industry's ad campaign, have quietly
closed the window of opportunity by premeditated inaction while a
distracted public was looking the other way.
</P>
<P>
   _ The proposed Patients' Bill of Rights. Intended to protect
everyone's right to choose a doctor _ and the physician's right,
free from insurance company pressures, to prescribe needed medical
treatment _ this proposal, too, has fallen by the wayside. The
bill, important to many millions of Americans, was so watered down
by the House majority that it bears little resemblance to its
original purpose.
</P>
<P>
   _ The slow strangulation of America's electoral process, the
very lifeline of democracy, by ever-bigger contributions from
private interests intent on controlling elections for their own
purposes. Congress has been powerless to pass reforms. Twice this
year, a bipartisan House majority has voted to close the gaping
``soft money'' loophole through which big corporations and others
with axes to grind are funneling millions into political campaigns.
Each time, however, the majority will was thwarted by leadership
maneuvers. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott have put the reforms in deep freeze for one more
extravagant binge of campaign excesses.
</P>
<P>
   Substantial majorities of the American people want prompt
attention to each of these priorities. But GOP congressional
leaders have gambled that they are safe in ignoring these needs
because press and public are fixated on the sensational pornography
of impeachment hearings. The nation's top newscasters,
competitively thirsting for ratings, have kept public attention
distracted from our country's serious business by the constant,
repetitious stream of chatter about Monicagate.
</P>
<P>
   And the public is saying, ``Enough!''
</P>
<P>
   No other American president _ neither Richard Nixon nor Andrew
Johnson _ was ever hounded as long, harassed as persistently or
attacked as viciously as Clinton has been. From the moment he
became president, determined critics have been out to discredit and
remove him from office by any means available. Clinton's enemies
accused him of financial improprieties over the Whitewater
investment; of unnamed sins for replacing White House travel
agents; of selling out U.S. interests to China for campaign
contributions; and even of personal culpability in the suicide of
his lifelong friend, Vince Foster.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to prove any of that, Kenneth Starr now claims that
Clinton obstructed justice by helping Monica Lewinsky get a job.
Yet Starr mysteriously left Lewinsky's sworn testimony on this out
of his report. ``No one ever asked me to lie, and I was never
promised a job for my silence,'' she testified to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the people are right. Clinton has been punished, and we
should get the focus back on this nation's unfinished business.

NEW TEXAS FILM FEST GOES WESTERN, FROM WAYNE TO McMURTRY 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ To steal a joke from Tommy Lee Jones, film
festivals are everywhere except Dime Box these days. So a new fest
needs a hook. All the established fests have one: Sundance is the
place to be for independent cinema; Toronto the place to be for
just about everything; Cannes the place to be for international
appeal, star-spotting and ogling of barely dressed people of both
genders.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the hook for the first Fort Worth Film Festival is
the West. Westerns will dominate the inaugural festival, which will
run Oct. 22-25 at several downtown venues, including both AMC
theaters, the Caravan of Dreams and the Chisholm Trail Parking Lot
in Sundance Square.
</P>
<P>
   But don't think that westerns are limited to two cowpokes
staring each other down and drawling, ``Draw.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think of westerns, I think of anything from John Wayne
in his `Lone Star' period of the early '30s to `Thelma and
Louise,''' says Michael H. Price, the president of the festival
board and formerly the longtime film critic of the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram. ``Just as film noir doesn't always mean a detective
in a trench coat, a western doesn't always mean cowboys and
sagebrush. It's anything that epitomizes the West.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that there won't be cowboys and sagebrush. The festival has
an impressive lineup of traditional and revisionist westerns,
including ``Giant,'' ``High Noon,'' ``The Wild Bunch'' and ``The
Good, the Bad and the Ugly.'' A to-be-announced Roy Rogers film is
also planned. A survey on the festival's Web site
(www.fortworthfilmfest.com) asks Net-surfers and film buffs to vote
for other westerns, and the picks will run in at least one
seven-hour block. To give you an idea of the eclectic selection,
the Coen Brothers' raucous 1987 film ``Raising Arizona'' has been a
leading vote-getter.
</P>
<P>
   The fest goes beyond westerns, though _ in fact, it goes beyond
the usual fest fare, with concert performances by such local
musicians as bluesman Robert Ealey. Many stars and filmmakers will
be on hand: Tippi Hedren will introduce screenings of her two
Alfred Hitchcock films, ``The Birds'' and ``Marnie'' (the Postal
Service will have a cancellation ceremony for its Hitchcock stamp
during opening ceremonies). L.Q. Jones and Bo Hopkins will
introduce ``The Wild Bunch''; M. Emmet Walsh will introduce the
Coen Brothers' ``Blood Simple,'' and novelist Larry McMurtry will
introduce a to-be-announced film based on one of his works.
</P>
<P>
   The fest will also feature many films by local and/or Texas
filmmakers. Price touts ``Rushmore,'' the latest by Texas filmmaker
Wes Anderson (''Bottle Rocket''). The film, a boarding-school
comedy featuring Bill Murray, also received good response at the
Toronto festival. UT-Arlington film Professor Andy Anderson's
``Detention'' will screen, as will films by Metroplex filmmakers
Blake Calhoun (''Thugs''), Bret McCormick (''Repligator'') and
festival artistic director Dwight Greene (''Ramming Speed'').
</P>
<P>
   The fest is starting slowly, with a four-day run instead of the
week to 10-day run of other festivals. It's dipping its toes into
an ocean of Texas fests: Dallas has the USA Film Festival, along
with a video festival and a kid-film festival; Austin has two
festivals, spring's South by Southwest and fall's Heart of Film;
and Houston has a film festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's room for one more, as long as the newcomer
brings something to the table besides a big appetite,'' Price says.
``I wouldn't do this unless I thought I could bring something
new.''
</P>
<P>
   A full four-day pass is $45. A one-day pass (for Friday-Sunday
only) is $17.50, and will get you into all events that day.
Individual films are $6.50. Some films, such as ``Rushmore,'' might
cost more; for ticket information, call 817-237-1008.

DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS TOUTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENIFER HANRAHAN 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; You've probably already heard of comfort foods.
But how about tortilla chips that lift your spirits? Or granola
bars that increase your sex drive?
</P>
<P>
   And then there's chewing gum that helps you concentrate better
and remember more. Talk about food for thought.
</P>
<P>
   Products that promise to prevent disease, improve your health
beyond standard nutrition or just plain make you feel better are
one of the hottest trends in the food and pharmaceutical
industries.
</P>
<P>
   Called nutraceuticals, the products encompass a wide variety of
food, beverage and dietary supplements enhanced with vitamins,
minerals, herbs and other nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the days when following the food pyramid was the key to
good nutrition? It's not so easy anymore, some medical experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're entering an era (in which) we realize you can't
necessarily get _ through a regular diet _ the amount of nutrients
you need for optimal health,'' said Dr. Marcus Elliott, a Santa
Barbara sports medicine specialist.
</P>
<P>
   As the popularity of herbal remedies grows, customers are
gobbling up ever more creative concoctions. Instead of popping
pills, people can now get the benefits of dietary supplements in
food that actually tastes good.
</P>
<P>
   There's corn puffs with ginseng, hard candy with fiber and
multivitamin Gummi Bears. The chewing gum contains phospholipids, a
type of fat that plays a role in nervous-system function;
manufacturers of Brain Gum promise you'll ``reverse age-related
memory loss by 12 years'' just by chewing a piece of gum three
times a day, preferably after a meal, for three to four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But not all doctors are buying into the hype. Humans are
physiologically programmed to extract everything we need from
regular food _ that's why we've evolved so successfully, said Dr.
Laurence Kedes, executive director of the Institute for Genetic
Medicine at the University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the vast majority of people, a normal, balanced diet of
fat, protein and carbohydrates will give you all the vitamins,
minerals and dietary requirements that you need,'' Kedes said. ``We
are not lacking anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Kedes, however, on the advice of his doctor, admits to taking
vitamin E, an anti-oxidant that seems to help protect cells from
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need something to counteract the horrible diet I eat,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The question for consumers: Are these products really better for
you, or are the additives just a gimmick to boost sales? And, even
more importantly, are they safe?
</P>
<P>
   They look like junk food. They taste like junk food. But
manufacturers insist they are really health food.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ehrlich, president of Robert's American Gourmet in
Roslyn, N.Y., makes Ginkgo Biloba Rings (puffed potato and corn
flavored with onion), Power Puffs (corn puffs with bee pollen and
ginseng) and Veggie Booty (puffed rice and corn with spinach and
kale).
</P>
<P>
   His snack foods, which sell for 99 cents a bag, are low in fat
(1.5 to 6 grams of fat per 1-ounce serving) and calories (about 120
calories per serving).
</P>
<P>
   While he admits his snack foods probably don't contain enough
herbs for a ``therapeutic effect,'' ``it's a lifestyle-changing
food,'' Ehrlich says. ``If you're doing something positive, you may
do something else positive.''
</P>
<P>
   But that conclusion does not satisfy scientists or the medical
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows for sure what dosages of herbs actually provide
health benefits, medical experts say. Conversely, the long-term
effects of many herbs are still not known, said Bruce Silverglade,
director of legal affairs for the Center for Science in the Public
Interest, a consumer advocacy group in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``While they may have benefits, they may also have risks, just
like a prescription drug,'' Silverglade said. ``The fact that an
herb has benefits should send up warning signals to the consumer
that it may have side effects or be dangerous at certain dosages.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite doubts about their effectiveness and concerns about
safety, the public is in a nutraceutical feeding frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen L. DeFelice, chairman of the Foundation for
Innovation in Medicine, coined the term in 1989 to describe foods
with nutritional and pharmaceutical qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, it's been applied to a broad range of products _
from fortified breakfast cereals to herbal dietary supplement
capsules to increasingly bizarre recipes like Kava Kava Corn Chips
laced with the pulverized roots of kava, a South Pacific pepper
plant that purports to have relaxing properties.
</P>
<P>
   Food and pharmaceutical companies are rushing to satisfy the
public's appetite by forming partnerships to market nutraceuticals
to baby boomers who made low-fat, low-cal foods such a success.
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco's Specialty Products Division now makes a version of
Knox unflavored gelatin called NutraJoint that's enhanced with
vitamin C, calcium and two amino acids used by the body in building
joint cartilage.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson Co.'s McNeil Consumer Products unit has
obtained worldwide marketing rights to stanol ester, a patented
dietary ingredient that lowers cholesterol by blocking its
absorption into the bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   As major corporations have embraced the products sometimes
called ``functional foods'' or ``enhanced foods,'' nutraceuticals
have moved from the shelves of alternative health stores to major
grocery and drug stores.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of nutraceuticals hit $8.8 billion in 1996, according to a
study by Datamonitor, a New York-based independent research firm.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the money used to come from sales of pills and
tablets, enhanced foods are rapidly gaining market share from
dietary supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Fortified juices and soft drinks account for nearly 30 percent
of functional food sales.
</P>
<P>
   Some are as standard as orange juice with calcium added. Others
are as exotic as Alter Ego beverages. The Smartness Enhancer drink
features ginkgo biloba and Siberian ginseng, said to boost energy
and endurance. Body Relaxer contains kava, chamomile and valerian,
a sedative. Energy Booster contains guarana, a stimulant from the
Brazilian rain forest, and fo-ti, an ancient herb used by the
Chinese before going into battle that is supposed to intensify
awareness of your surroundings. A four-pack sells for $5.99.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not attempting to tell people that by drinking these
products they will cure any diseases,'' said Sumner Katz, president
of American Marketing Technology Group that launched Alter Ego
beverages a few months ago. ``We have tried to put in a synergistic
blend of herbs that would have a health benefit and taste good.''
</P>
<P>
   They better not claim to treat disease, or they may get in
trouble with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Herbal remedies and additives became more prevalent after 1994,
when the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act exempted
dietary supplements from the rigorous regulation required of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   That means dietary supplements _ and many nutraceuticals fall
into this category _ can make all sorts of health claims on the
label without showing any proof, so long as they don't promise to
treat or cure disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has made these products in a regulatory gray area,'' said
an FDA spokeswoman. ``Many of the ingredients are not approved as
food additives. It's a confusing issue that we are looking at
now.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent New England Journal of Medicine editorial argued that
herbs should be held up to the same standards as other drugs.
Testimonials and speculation are no substitute for precise medical
evidence that treatments are safe and effective, the editorial
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There cannot be two kinds of medicine _ conventional and
alternative,'' wrote Drs. Marcia Angell and Jerome P. Kassirer in
the Sept. 17 issue. ``There is only medicine that has been
adequately tested and medicine that has not, medicine that works
and medicine that may or may not work.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctors, while acknowledging that most untested herbal
remedies are probably harmless, also described a series of
incidents involving harmful herbal additives:
</P>
<P>
   Doctors from Alberta Children's Hospital in Canada reported two
cases in which parents opted to treat their children's cancer with
shark cartilage or the herb astragalus instead of standard
medicines. In both cases, the cancers progressed, and one child
died.
</P>
<P>
   The California Department of Health Services tested 260
traditional Chinese medicines and found one-third were contaminated
with heavy metals, such as lead and arsenic, or pharmaceuticals not
listed on the labels.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors from Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Jersey
tested a mixture of eight herbs, sold as PC-SPES, on men with
prostate cancer. They found it worked like estrogen, decreasing
testosterone and cutting sex drive. While not proving whether it
cures cancer, the study shows the herb blend has potent hormonal
effects.
</P>
<P>
   What seems sure is that the nutraceutical market will continue
to grow as herbs are embraced by consumers in the never-ending
quest for endless youth and good health.
</P>
<P>
   While some believe nutraceuticals may mean consumers spending
billions in wasted money, some experts are hopeful they will
eventually weed out the quackery from the curatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is confusing for the consumer, but the consumer is the one
who fuels this,'' said Dr. Paul Lachance, head of the food science
department at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., and
director of the school's Nutraceutical Institute. ``The potential
is a decrease in health-care costs if we can find the right
approaches. That's where the secret lies.''

RESEARCHERS COLOR THEM EFFECTIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENIFER HANRAHAN 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; A team of researchers from around the country has
divided nutraceuticals into four categories _ green, yellow, orange
and red _ based on effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   GREEN: Herbs and compounds found in the ``green'' category have
proved efficacy during rigorous scientific testing and clinical
trials in humans.
</P>
<P>
   About 19 percent of the 600 claims investigated so far fall into
this category, said Dr. Paul Lachance, head of the food science
department at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., and
director of the school's Nutraceutical Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Vitamins and minerals that doctors long have known are necessary
for good health, such as vitamins C and D, calcium and beta
carotene are in this category.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's wort also falls into this category for treatment of
mild depression. So does guarana, an herb that acts as a stimulant
similar to caffeine.
</P>
<P>
   YELLOW: About 9 percent of the products tested so far fall in
the ``yellow'' category, compounds that seem to have some health
benefits when held up to scientific scrutiny, but additional tests
still are needed.
</P>
<P>
   Claims that ginkgo biloba improves circulation and alleviates
tension headaches fall into this category.
</P>
<P>
   So does echinacea's role in boosting the immune system's
function.
</P>
<P>
   ORANGE: About 30 percent of compounds fall into the ``orange''
category. These products have been tested only in animals or have
undergone very limited testing in humans.
</P>
<P>
   Valerian, to alleviate insomnia, and green tea, said to be an
anti-oxidant, fall into this category. So does kava, a root extract
that some say eases menopause symptoms and anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Some manufacturers claim St. John's wort provides protection
from viral infections. There's not much to prove this; for this
claim, St. John's wort also belongs in orange.
</P>
<P>
   RED: The rest of the nutraceutical compounds _ a whopping 41
percent _ fall into the ``red'' category. These are the ones where
``there is very little or no evidence to support the claims,''
Lachance said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, there is almost no evidence that ginkgo biloba
will help with premenstrual syndrome or improve eyesight or sex
drive.

<P>
   WASHINGTON, Sept. 28 -- Seemingly harmless surveys, contests and
electronic pen pal web sites are sometimes cleverly disguised tools
directed at youngsters to obtain marketing data, children's rights
advocates charge.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is now grappling with how to protect the privacy rights
of children who unknowingly forfeit personal information when
contacting these web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Children frequently forfeit personal information not knowing
what it will be used for when they contact commercial web sites.
The information is then used by companies to market products to the
youngsters, according to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability of the Internet to gather information and slice
and dice it ... we have not seen anything like this before,'' said
Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the FTC.
</P>
<P>
   Most children's commercial web sites collect basic information
from youngsters including name, e-mail address, gender, age and
preferences for such things as toys. One web site even asks for
financial information including what gifts in the forms of stocks,
cash, savings bonds or mutual funds the child receives. The site
also asks children to reveal who gave them gifts. b

AMERICANS LEARN THAT TAKING GUNS INTO MEXICO IS A RISKY VENURE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Lubbock rancher Johnny Bob Carruth took a wrong turn into
Mexico earlier this year, he ran straight into a culture clash.
</P>
<P>
   Carruth, 50, was arrested for smuggling his Winchester
.22-caliber rifle into Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El
Paso.
</P>
<P>
   The simple act of carrying an old rifle in his pickup _ which he
had done for 17 years _ cost him 46 days in Mexican custody and
more than $100,000 in legal fees and other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   But Carruth is lucky. He could have spent two to eight years
behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Whether by mistake or ignorance of Mexican law, increasing
numbers of U.S. citizens are being arrested by Mexican authorities
at border crossings and hit with big fines and long prison terms _
in some cases, up to 30 years _ for illegally importing firearms or
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Embassy officials in Mexico City said as of June, 69 of the
317 Americans in Mexican jails were being held on weapons or
ammunition charges and more are being arrested every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texans have a tradition of cherishing their right to bear
arms, and Mexico is very wary about arms in the hands of civilians.
It's an area where we have an ongoing cultural clash,'' said George
Kopf, the U.S. consul in Matamoros. ``Unfortunately, the results
are many arrested people, many confiscated vehicles and much
tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, three Americans who had spent months in Mexican jails
because of weapons violations were sent back to the United States
in a routine prisoner exchange. But Kopf said Americans apparently
aren't getting the message. Three have been jailed in his district
in the past two weeks, and 125 have been arrested across Mexico so
far this year.
</P>
<P>
   And while Mexico experts say escalating violence by well-armed
drug traffickers and armed peasant uprisings in southern Mexico are
behind an increasingly hard line taken by the Mexican government,
Americans who have been arrested claim it is pure extortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not any damn guerrillas or drugs. The Mexican officials
know either the people who get caught will come up with the money
to secure their release, or their family will,'' insists Carruth.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the clash between Mexico and the United States
are differing attitudes and public policies regarding firearms in
the neighboring nations. In Texas and most other states,
law-abiding adults can purchase an unlimited number of firearms,
including weapons used by the military and police and powerful,
large-caliber handguns.
</P>
<P>
   But in Mexico, civilians must obtain expensive permits from the
military to buy sporting arms used for hunting. Handguns are almost
impossible to purchase legally, and weapons used by the military
and police are strictly prohibited in the hands of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``When folks are arrested they frequently say, ```I didn't
know,' or `My gun was legally registered in the U.S. so what's the
problem?''' said Kopf. ``I guess we have a lot more to do in terms
of public information on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Texas dove season began earlier this month, Kopf
closed down his consulate for a day and dispatched his staff to
distribute 10,000 leaflets in South Texas stores where firearms and
ammunition are sold. It was an effort to spread the word about the
legal procedure for importing sporting guns and ammunition into
Mexico, and to warn hunters against leaving a box of shells in
their vehicles if they cross the Rio Grande to shop or dine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't bring your guns into Mexico,'' is the message Mark
Leoni, the American consul in Ciudad Juarez, across the border from
El Paso, wants Americans to remember when heading south. ``Be aware
these laws are being enforced. The Mexicans are within their rights
to enforce them, and they have heavy penalties.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Americans who inadvertently crossed into Mexico
with a weapon were charged with simple possession. But in recent
years, Mexican authorities have stepped up enforcement, charging
violators with more serious smuggling charges.
</P>
<P>
   The change in policy, Leoni notes, makes a big difference.
Simple possession of a non-military firearm (less than .38-caliber)
or ammunition carries penalties from six months to three years in
jail, but allows violators to post a bond. And most Americans who
post bond in Mexico head home with no intentions of returning to
face trial. But a smuggling charge for carrying the same weapon
carries a two to eight year sentence, and bond is not allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican law is even stricter for possessing or smuggling
firearms and ammunition reserved for military use, such as pistols
larger than .38-caliber, rifles of .30-caliber or greater, shotguns
larger than 12-gauge or those with barrels shorter than 25 inches.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty for possessing such weapons is one to 12 years in
prison, depending on the type of weapon, and smuggling such weapons
into Mexico or even one round of military ammunition carries a
five- to 30-year prison sentence, plus fines up to $2,000, consular
officials warn.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say Mexican judges have no choice but to sentence
someone found guilty of arms smuggling, despite extenuating
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Even character references from Louisiana police and his priest,
and the fact the guns he was caught with belonged to someone else,
didn't help Lake Charles meatcutter Johnny Manuel avoid a prison
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 18, a Mexican judge sentenced Manuel to a five-year
prison term for smuggling two hunting rifles and a pistol owned by
his fiancee, who worked as a security guard on a riverboat casino
in Lake Charles. Manuel, 49, was helping his fiancee move from
Arizona to Louisiana last March when the couple stopped for the
night in El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Like rancher Carruth, Manuel planned to park on the U.S. side of
the border and walk across the bridge to Juarez. But he took the
wrong exit off the freeway and heavy traffic prevented him from
turning back. He ended up driving his fiancee's car _ loaded with
all her belongings _ over another bridge into Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad, very, very sad,'' said Jackie Palermo, Manuel's
sister. ``It has stripped him of everything. He feels like he's
been dropped into another world and swallowed.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the emotional toll, Manuel's conviction has also brought
financial hardship on his eight brothers and sisters, as well as a
21-year-old son, who take turns calling him at the Ciudad Juarez
prison, his sister said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has paralyzed us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If an appeal is turned down next month, Palermo hopes her
brother can take part in the next prisoner exchange and at least
serve his sentence in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   No less an ordeal confronted Carruth last February. The Lubbock
rancher and businessman and his 17-year-old daughter visited El
Paso for a junior livestock show. Afterward, Carruth decided to
briefly walk into Mexico, a visit that would give his daughter
extra credit in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   But Carruth got turned around. Instead of parking by a downtown
bridge, he took a freeway exit to a second border crossing, which
abruptly leads across the international bridge. Knowing he was not
supposed to take a gun into Mexico, the rancher asked Mexican
officials where he could turn around and he declared the rifle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got on the wrong bridge by mistake and realized too
late,'' he said. ``When we realized what we'd done, there was no
way out. There were hundreds of cars behind us and hundreds ahead.
I declared the rifle right off. I thought that was the right thing
to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they got me for smuggling,'' he said. ``If I had been
trying to do that, I wouldn't have shown them the damn thing.
That's the real gripe I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Carruth and his daughter were taken into custody, and while the
teen-ager was held for eight hours and released to friends, the
rancher wound up in the local jail for three days in conditions
``worse than any hog pen you've seen in your life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After paying lawyers, Carruth was given a suspended two-year
sentence and released in late March after spending 46 days in jail.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to deal with the problem, Mexican politicians have
introduced legal reforms in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials familiar with the measures say the reforms
don't apply to weapons Mexico reserves for military or police use.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need to see is something that addresses all weapons,
because at least 50 percent of our cases involve people with a
military weapon,'' said Leoni, the American consul in Juarez.
``What we think would be very helpful is legislation that would
allow federal officers to exercise more discretion on who they
would consider an arms trafficker.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, El Paso Mayor Carlos Ramirez said he has
developed an agreement, along with the governor-elect of Chihuahua,
the Juarez mayor and police chief and chamber officials, to quickly
intercede in cases of Americans who import weapons by accident.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez said if investigation by police on both sides of the
river shows the American made an honest mistake, U.S. authorities
would ask their Mexican counterparts at the bridge to release the
suspect before the case is entered into the legal system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, once the arraignment has taken place, the
wheels of the Mexican justice system continue to grind,'' Ramirez
said.

&HT;        CONGRESS CONSIDERS REGULATING CHILDREN'S MARKETING ON WORLD
WIDE WEB
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Mark D. Preston  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Sept. 28 -- Seemingly harmless surveys, contests and
electronic pen pal web sites are sometimes cleverly disguised tools
directed at youngsters to obtain marketing data, children's rights
advocates charge.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is now grappling with how to protect the privacy rights
of children who unknowingly forfeit personal information when
contacting these web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Children frequently forfeit personal information not knowing
what it will be used for when they contact commercial web sites.
The information is then used by companies to market products to the
youngsters, according to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability of the Internet to gather information and slice
and dice it ... we have not seen anything like this before,'' said
Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the FTC.
</P>
<P>
   Most children's commercial web sites collect basic information
from youngsters including name, e-mail address, gender, age and
preferences for such things as toys. One web site even asks for
financial information including what gifts in the forms of stocks,
cash, savings bonds or mutual funds the child receives. The site
also asks children to reveal who gave them gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Children unknowingly fill out this information to be entered
into contests, receive prizes or get a subscriptions to
newsletters.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee is
expected to vote this week whether or not to release a bill to the
Senate floor that would regulate how web sites collect market data
from children. The bill is authored by Senator Richard Bryan, a
Nevada Democrat, and is cosponsored by Senator John McCain, a
Arizona Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act would require on-
line companies to obtain parental permission before they solicit
information from children under 13 years of age who contact their
web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children by their very nature, are honest and trusting,''
Bryan said. ``When approached on the Internet by their favorite
cartoon characters or offered a chance to win a prize, children
will freely provide information.''
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Pitofsky said a recent FTC survey of over 200
commercial children's web sites revealed that over 90 percent were
designed to collect personal information from kids. The web pages
ranged from registration pages and contests to guest books,
application forms and pen pals.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC report found that only 54 percent of the children's web
sites provided some form or statement about their practices and
only 23 percent of the sites direct children to seek parental
permission before submitting personal information. Only one percent
required parental permission prior to collecting such information.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is deplorable,'' Senator Bryan said. ``Children 12 and
under are not fully capable of understanding the consequences of
giving out personal information on-line.''
</P>
<P>
   The U. S. is far behind other countries when it comes to privacy
issues, said Professor Ethan Katsh, director of the Center of
Information Technology and Dispute Resolution at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say what we really need pretty quickly is widespread
recognition that our privacy is being compromised routinely,''
Katsh said. ``If we don't take some steps very quickly it will be
to late.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet provides an interactive vehicle for teenagers and
adults to explore new worlds and obtain information virtually on
every subject. And young children are a fast growing segment of the
population that is going on-line.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 report estimates that 16 million youngsters -- about 14
percent of America's 69 million children under the age of 18 -- are
frequently surfing the information superhighway either at home or
in school. And six million are under the age of 12, according to
Find/SVP's 1997 American Internet User Survey.
</P>
<P>
   Marketers have been quick to capitalize on this new medium, by
compiling data collected from children and then targeting them for
promotions or to shop their wares. Using the information collected
from children the on-line companies solicit them with catalogues,
turning kids into mini-consumers who harass their parents to make
purchases for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is to easy to be anonymous and exploit kids on-line,'' said
Kate Delhagen, an analyst for Forrester Research -- a Cambridge
Mass. based-technology research company.
</P>
<P>
   The on-line industry was initially reluctant to support federal
regulations, but is now working with Congress to craft a law that
is heavy with self-regulation. They argue such legislation would be
the best way to implement guidelines in the global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur B. Sackler, vice president of Law and Public Policy for
Time Warner, Inc. is advocating for the U.S. to implement a strong
self- regulatory law that may be used as a model for other
countries. Otherwise, he said, countries throughout the world will
each establish their own laws making it difficult to do business.
</P>
<P>
   ``A market-driven self-regulatory approach is the model you can
sell most effectively overseas and have something similar if not
identical in other countries,'' Sackler said. ``We need, at bottom,
as much self- regulation as possible to make the global machine as
workable as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner operates more than 200 web sites including CNN
Interactive, Pathfinder, WB Online and the Cartoon Network. But
Sackler said it is Time Warner's policy not to collect personal
information from kids under 13 without parental notice.
</P>
<P>
   The on-line industry and Congress are now revising certain
aspects of Bryan's bill to satisfy each sides' needs and concerns.
But one aspect the industry agrees with is a ``safe harbor'' clause
that would allow companies flexibility with the new regulations, if
approved by the FTC. But not everybody believes industry
self-regulation is the proper way to address on-line marketing
practices to children. Children's advocates for example caution it
might not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Montgomery, president of the Center for Media Education
-- a Washington-based children's advocacy group that monitors
electronic media -- said self-regulation does not work.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience with self-regulation is that it is kind of
elastic,'' Montgomery said. ``It will be strengthened when there
are threats of government regulation or scrutiny -- such as it is
now -- but it becomes lax when there isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Delhagen, of Forrester Research, said it becomes ``complicated''
when companies are left to police themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without regulations, certain aggressive marketers will
continue to end run any policy or hand-shake agreement,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One group steadfastly opposed to the bill is the San
Francisco-based Electronic Frontier Foundation -- a non-profit
group specializing in free speech and privacy issues on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Steinhardt, the group's president, said they oppose the
bill because there is information -- particularly pertaining to
health and sexuality -- that teenagers might not otherwise be able
to access if the bill becomes law.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it is a laudable goal to protect the privacy of
information, the bill may in effect block minors from getting
information they are entitled,'' Steinhardt said. ``The strength of
the Internet is that it allows teenagers access of important
information without getting permission from parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinhardt also said it might provide less protection for the
parent who will have to reveal information when he or she gives
consent to their children if the bill becomes law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may have the unintended and ironic effect of disclosing
information,'' Steinhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no companion legislation in the House, but Bryan said
there are a few members who have expressed interest in introducing
a similar bill. With Congress set to adjourn in mid-October, the
likelihood a bill could be passed this year is quickly fading. But
Bryan said he is still optimistic and hopes to have legislation
passed this year limiting on-line marketing practices directed
towards children.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Goldberg, a spokeswoman for the White House, said
President Clinton favors stronger regulations to protect on-line
privacy, but would not commit to supporting the bill until he sees
the final version passed by Congress.

POLLS SHOWS TRANSIT PROBLEMS TAKE TOLL ON SAN FRANCISCO MAYOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREGORY LEWIS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mayor Willie Brown is getting decidedly mixed
reviews in his performance despite the city's generally healthy
economy, according to a survey released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With more than a year to go before he faces re-election, 41
percent of those surveyed said they approved of Brown's job
performance while just one in three would vote now to re-elect him
to a second term, according to the poll commissioned by the San
Francisco Examiner and KTVU-TV.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-six percent of those polled said they would consider a
rival candidate while 21 percent would vote to replace Brown if the
election were held now, the poll said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown apparently is hurt by troubles with the city's municipal
transit system, his handling of the city's homeless problem and a
perception that he is arrogant.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor gets praise for the city's strong economy, his
plans to develop Treasure Island and the vibrancy he brings to
public life, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
   As he looks toward re-election in November 1999, the poll shows
59 percent of those surveyed believe San Francisco is headed in the
right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mixed bag,'' said Del Ali of Mason-Dixon
Political/Media Research, which conducted the survey. ``He's lucky
there's not two parties in San Francisco. He's also lucky the other
(possible) challengers have high negatives.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor gets higher favorable ratings than any of those
considered potential challengers, including state Sen. Quentin
Kopp, Board of Supervisors President Barbara Kaufman and former
political consultant Clint Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   Kandace Bender, a spokesman for the mayor, played down Brown's
rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mayor Brown is much more highly visible because he's in the
news everyday and earns high visibility,'' said Bender, who is
traveling with the mayor in China. ``Who knows _ those numbers
could change.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 637 registered San Francisco voters was conducted
Sept. 23-24 by Mason-Dixon Political/Media research. The margin of
error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found 41 percent of those surveyed said Brown was doing
a good or excellent job, down from 46 percent in an Examiner poll
conducted last December. His job approval was 55 percent in a May
1997 poll, and 54 percent in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But Bender defended the mayor by pointing to those who believe
the city is in good shape overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most significant finding of the poll was regardless of
(the transit system's) recent troubles and concerns about the
homeless, 60 percent of the city believes the city is headed in the
right direction,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey indicates extreme dissatisfaction with the mayor's
handling of the municipal transit system. Only 18 percent gave him
above-average grades for improving the Municipal Railway while 45
percent rated his performance as poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Muni was more of an issue, he'd be in a lot of trouble,''
Ali said. ``But he gets good ratings on the economy and jobs and
those are more important issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's 1995 election victory over incumbent Frank Jordan has
been credited, in part, for his criticism of the troubled transit
agency and his pledge to improve it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of mayors who have lost re-election because of
poor city services is long,'' said Andrew Sullivan, co-founder of
the riders advocacy group Rescue Muni. ``I hope this mayor is aware
of that. They have a year to make improvements, and I hope they do,
not for the political implications, but because, as a Muni
customer, I want to see service improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown got strong ratings for improving the local economy and
handling Treasure Island's conversion from a military facility to
civil use.
</P>
<P>
   According to the poll, 56 percent of those surveyed said he had
done a good or excellent job of improving the local economy and 42
percent approved of the way he began converting the former base at
Treasure Island to civilian use.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor was pleased his efforts to create jobs and preside
over a strong economy for longer-term economic health have been
acknowledged by San Franciscans,'' Bender said.

APATHY CAN CHANGE THE RIGHT TO KNOW TO THE RIGHT TO `NO'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PHIL RECORD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I found it interesting that much of the debate in Congress about
whether to make public President Clinton's videotaped testimony to
a grand jury was conducted in secret.
</P>
<P>
   That says a lot about holders of public office.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that many who were once candidates for public office
undergo quite a metamorphosis when they become holders of the
office. Their attitude about the First Amendment and the public's
right to know undergoes considerable change. And the longer they
are in office, the greater the change.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, as a reporter for the Star-Telegram and later as
a member of the newspaper's editorial board, I had numerous
opportunities to interview and listen to candidates for political
office.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot recall a single newcomer to the world of politics who
did not claim to be a champion of the First Amendment's free
press/free speech rights and the public's right to know.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many did not realize that these rights were not one and
the same. Their confusion is similar to that many have concerning
what the courts have ruled is the source of the right to possess a
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, the First Amendment says that the government cannot
tell the owners of a press or broadcast facility what they can or
cannot print or broadcast. Similarly, the amendment says that we
Americans can say what we want to say without governmental
interference.
</P>
<P>
   These are constitutional rights. They are very difficult to
amend. The Supreme Court also has ruled that they are not absolute,
although the limitations are pretty narrow.
</P>
<P>
   But the public's right to know is much more fragile.
</P>
<P>
   That is a statutory right. And therein lies the danger, for we
know that what legislators may give today, they might take away
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   That is what has happened _ and continues to happen _ to
right-to-know laws, often referred to by the news media and those
in government as ``sunshine laws.''
</P>
<P>
   They actually are fairly new to the American experience. It was
not until after World War II that there have been concerted efforts
to convince Congress, state legislatures and local governmental
bodies to adopt laws and ordinances giving the people the right to
attend meetings of governmental bodies (open meetings laws) and to
have access to public documents (open records laws).
</P>
<P>
   Fledging politicians love to champion these constitutional and
statutory rights _ until they get elected. Then they find that such
rights can bring them embarrassment and churn up the wrath of
voters _ the one thing politicians fear most.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has a long record of exempting itself from rules and
regulations it imposes on others. So it was that the U.S. House
Judiciary Committee could meet legally behind closed doors to
discuss what to do with the Clinton tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that this was an issue of concern to much of the
public. The fact that many Americans had varying and strongly held
opinions on the subject made it much more comfortable for the
committee members to meet in private.
</P>
<P>
   The doors of public business were closed to you and me.
</P>
<P>
   You actually heard little fuss about this. Journalists have seen
this happen so often in Congress that they have grown weary
protesting about it. And most members of the public do not complain
about the trampling of these rights until they are the ones who get
trampled on in a specific case.
</P>
<P>
   When most sunshine laws were adopted, the exemptions were pretty
narrow, especially when it came to public meetings. The exemptions
usually called for closed-door meetings when governmental officials
were discussing legal matters with their attorneys, delicate
personnel matters and purchase of property.
</P>
<P>
   But these exemptions have grown through the years, some to raise
the comfort level of officeholders and bureaucrats, some to grant
privacy to special interests.
</P>
<P>
   Congressmen and legislators often come under intense pressure
from special-interest groups _ many of whom help to fill their
campaign coffers _ to grant exemptions from scrutiny by the public.
</P>
<P>
   And special-interest groups are not the only ones that work to
weaken these right-to-know laws. Governmental agencies also do so.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a Texas Senate committee held meetings to
consider possible changes to the Public Information Act. Some
witnesses wanted loopholes expanded; others wanted them closed.
</P>
<P>
   It was Laura McGee, a former records manager and acting
secretary for the city of Dallas, who reminded the senators that
government can be more of an obstruction than a service to citizens
requesting information they assume to be public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some in local government see these requests as interference,''
she told the committee. ``It's actually a function of government.
We forget that.''
</P>
<P>
   I should not leave the impression that all of those in the halls
of Congress and the state capitols pose obstacles to the public's
right to know. There have been many champions of this right in
these high places.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a national officer of the Society of Professional
Journalists, we would make an annual pilgrimage to the Hill to call
on some of those champions. They included our own Jim Wright, Sen.

NO SIGNS OF REJECTION IN TRANSPLANTED FOREARM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ky.)   (af)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   The Australian man who received a transplanted hand and forearm
in France last Wednesday is recovering uneventfully without any
signs of graft rejection, his doctors said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Clint Hallam, ``is doing surprising well,'' said Dr.
Xavier R. Martin, after he and other members of the transplant team
examined the graft.
</P>
<P>
   Hallam walked Monday for the first time since the 13-and-a-half
hour operation and is eating, Martin said in a telephone interview
from the Edouard Herriot Hospital in Lyons, where the operation was
performed.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, there are no problems and no signs of rejection,''
Martin said. Nevertheless, it is far too soon to determine whether
the transplant will work because the graft can be rejected at any
time, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   A crucial sign of success at this stage is the skin color around
the graft because it indicates how well blood is flowing through
the arteries and veins that were connected during the operation.
``The color is very nice,'' Martin said. Another indication is the
amount of oxygen in the fingers. A device shows ``it is perfect,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hallam's fingers and part of his new hand are not covered by
bandages, so ``we can see the hand pretty well'' and there is also
``no excessive swelling,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   A physiotherapist performed passive exercises on the grafted
hand. Hallam is not allowed to move the donor hand or fingers by
himself because such action could tear any of the hundreds of
sutures used to connect the skin, muscles, tendons, nerves and
blood vessels before the tissues have time to heal, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   In the only other known hand transplant, in Ecuador in 1964, the
donor graft was rejected after two weeks. But the French doctors
are hopeful that advances in drugs and microsurgery since the
attempt in Ecuador will allow success in Hallam's case. Even if
Hallam's body does not reject the graft, it could take a year or
more for sensation and full movement to occur, if it does at all.
</P>
<P>
   Hallam is receiving the same antirejection drugs used in
transplants of kidneys and other organs, said Dr. Jean-Michel
Dubernard, head of the transplant team in Lyons. The drugs include
antilymphocytic globulin, tacrolimus, Mycophenolate Mofetil and
steroids, Dubernard said in an interview while he was in the United
States over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Tests of Hallam's liver and kidney function are normal,
indicating that there is no evidence of systemic rejection. A small
piece of skin was removed Monday from the grafted hand, in a
procedure known as a punch biopsy, so pathologists can examine it
for subtle evidence of rejection.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, the hand and forearm that Hallam nearly severed in a
chain-saw accident were reattached in New Zealand. But it did not
work and the hand and forearm were amputated in 1989 in Australia,
Dubernard said.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons is a leading French transplant center and the eight-member
team of doctors who performed the procedure included international
leaders in hand surgery and transplantation, Martin and Dubernard
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons is a leading French transplant center, and the
eight-member team of doctors who performed the procedure included
international leaders in hand surgery and transplantation, Martin
and Dubernard said.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Dubernard said he searched for a patient who was
undergoing kidney dialysis and who had lost a hand, because it
would have been easier to justify the experimental transplant
ethically. Hallam signed a very precise informed consent form,
Dubernard said.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, a team at the University of Louisville announced
that it was ready to perform a hand transplant. Last week, a member
said the team had never heard of the Lyons group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Louisville is not the center of the earth,'' Dubernard said
with a laugh.

WHEN SCIENTIFIC PREDICTIONS ARE SO GOOD, THEY'RE BAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.D., Colo., Neb., N.J., Calif.)   (af)  
 By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Noah had it easy. He got his prediction straight from the
horse's mouth and was left in no doubt about what to do.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Red River of the North was rising to record levels
in the spring of 1997, the citizens and officials of Grand Forks,
N.D., were not so privileged. They had to rely on scientists'
predictions about how high the water would rise. And in this case,
federal experts say, the flood forecast may have been issued and
used in a way that made things worse.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, the experts said, was that more precision was
assigned to the forecast than was warranted. Officials and citizens
tended to take as gospel an oft-repeated National Weather Service
prediction that the river would crest at a record 49 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there was a wider range of probabilities; the river
ultimately crested at 54 feet, forcing 50,000 people to abandon
their homes fast. The 49-foot forecast had lulled the town into a
false sense of security, said Dr. Roger A. Pielke Jr. of the
National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., a
consultant on a subsequent inquiry by the weather service.
</P>
<P>
   In fixating on the single number of 49 feet, the people involved
in the Grand Forks disaster made a common error in the use of
predictions and forecasts, experts who have studied the case say.
It was, they say, a case of what Alfred North Whitehead, the
mathematician and philosopher, once termed ``misplaced
concreteness.''
</P>
<P>
   And whether the problem is climate change, earthquakes, droughts
or floods, they say the tendency to overlook uncertainties, margins
of error and ranges of probability can lead to damaging
misjudgments.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was the topic of a workshop this month at Estes
Park, Colo. In part, participants said, the problem arises because
decision makers sometimes want to avoid making hard choices in
uncertain situations. They would rather place responsibility on the
predictors.
</P>
<P>
   Scientifically based predictions, typically using computerized
mathematical models, have become pervasive in modern society. But
only recently has much attention been paid to the proper use _ and
misuse _ of predictions.
</P>
<P>
   The Estes Park workshop, of which Pielke was an organizer, was
an attempt to come to grips with the question. The workshop was
sponsored by the Geological Society of America and the National
Center for Atmospheric Research.
</P>
<P>
   People have predicted and prophesied for millenniums, of course,
through means ranging from the visions of shamans and the warnings
of biblical prophets to the examination of animal entrails.
</P>
<P>
   With the arrival of modern science, people teased out
fundamental laws of physical and chemical behavior and used them to
make better and better predictions.
</P>
<P>
   But once science moves beyond the relatively deterministic
processes of physics and chemistry, prediction gets more
complicated and chancier. The earth's atmosphere, for instance,
often frustrates efforts to predict the weather and long-term
climatic changes because scientists have not nailed down all of its
physical workings and because a substantial measure of chaotic
unpredictability is inherent in the climate system.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a considerable range of uncertainty, much more so
than is popularly associated with science. So while computer
modeling has often made reasonable predictions possible, they are
always uncertain; results are by definition a model of reality, not
reality itself.
</P>
<P>
   The accuracy of predictions varies widely. Some, like earthquake
forecasts, have proved so disappointing that experts have turned
instead to forecasting longer-term earthquake potential in a
general sense and issuing last-second warnings to distant
communities once a quake has begun.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the success of a prediction is impossible or
difficult to judge. For instance, it will take thousands of years
to know whether the environmental effects of buried radioactive
waste will be as predicted.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, daily weather forecasts are checked almost
instantly and are used to improve the next day's forecast. But
weather forecasting is also a success, the assembled experts
agreed, because people know its shortcomings and take them into
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Weather forecasts ``are wrong a lot of the time, but people
expect that and they use them accordingly,'' said Robert
Ravenscroft, a Nebraska rancher who attended the workshop as a
``user'' of predictions.
</P>
<P>
   A prediction is to be distrusted, workshop participants said,
when it is made by the group that will use it as a basis for policy
making _ especially when the prediction is made after the policy
decision has been taken. In one example offered at the workshop,
modeling studies purported to show no harmful environmental effects
from a gold mine that a company had decided to dig.
</P>
<P>
   Another type of prediction miscue emerged last March in
connection with asteroids, the workshop participants were told by
Dr. Clark R. Chapman, a planetary scientist at the Southwest
Research Institute in Boulder. An astronomer erroneously calculated
that there was a chance of 0.1 percent that a mile-wide asteroid
would strike Earth in 30 years. The prediction created an
international stir but was withdrawn a day later after further
evidence turned up.
</P>
<P>
   This ``uncharacteristically bad'' prediction, said Chapman,
would not have been issued had it been subjected to normal review
by the forecaster's scientific peers. But, he said, there was no
peer-review apparatus set up to make sure that ``off-the-wall
predictions don't get out.'' (Such a committee has since been
established by NASA.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most sins committed in the name of prediction, however, appear
to stem from the uncertainty inherent in almost all forecasts.
``People don't understand error bars,'' said one scientist,
referring to margins of error. Global climate change and the Red
River flood offer two cases in point.
</P>
<P>
   Computer models of the climate system are the major instruments
used by scientists to project changes in climate that might result
from increasing atmospheric concentrations of heat-trapping gases,
like carbon dioxide, emitted by the burning of fossil fuels.
</P>
<P>
   Basing its forecast on the models, a panel of scientists set up
by the United Nations has projected that the average surface
temperature of the globe will rise by 2 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit,
with a best estimate of 3.5 degrees, in the next century, and more
after that. This compares with a rise of 5 to 9 degrees since the
depths of the last ice age. The temperature has increased by about
1 degree over the last century.
</P>
<P>
   But the magnitude and nature of any climate changes produced by
any given amount of carbon dioxide are uncertain. Moreover, it is
unclear how much of the gas will be emitted over the next few
years, said Dr. Jerry D. Mahlman, a workshop participant who
directs the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's
Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at Princeton, N.J. The
laboratory is one of the world's major climate modeling centers,
and the oldest.
</P>
<P>
   This uncertainty opens the way for two equal and opposite sins
of misinterpretation. ``The uncertainty is used as a reason for
governments not to act,'' in the words of Dr. Ronald D. Brunner, a
political scientist at the University of Colorado at Boulder. On
the other hand, people often put too much reliance on the precise
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In the debate over climate change, the tendency is to state all
the uncertainties and caveats associated with the climate model
projections _ and then forget about them, said Dr. Steve Rayner, a
specialist in global climate change in the District of Columbia
office of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   This creates a ``fallacy of misplaced confidence,'' he said,
explaining that the specific numbers in the model forecasts ``take
on a validity not allowed by the caveats.'' This tendency to focus
unwisely on specific numbers was termed ``fallacious
quantification'' by Dr. Naomi Oreskes, a historian at the
University of California at San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Where uncertainty rules, many at the workshop said, it might be
better to stay away from specific numbers altogether and issue a
more generalized forecast. In climate change, this might mean using
the models as a general indication of the direction in which the
climate is going (whether it is warming, for instance) and of the
approximate magnitude of the change, while taking the numbers with
a grain of salt.
</P>
<P>
   None of which means that the models are not a helpful guide to
public policy, said Mahlman and other experts. For example, the
models say that a warming atmosphere, like today's, will produce
heavier rains and snows, and some evidence suggests that this is
already happening in the United States, possibly contributing to
damaging floods. Local planners might be well advised to consider
this, Mahlman said.
</P>
<P>
   One problem in Grand Forks was that lack of experience with such
a damaging flood aggravated the uncertainty of the flood forecast.
Because the river had never before been observed at the 54-foot
level, the models on which the prediction was based were ``flying
blind,'' said Pielke; there was no historical basis on which to
produce a reliable forecast.
</P>
<P>
   But this was apparently lost on local officials and the public,
who focused on the specific forecast of a 49-foot crest. This
number was repeated so often, according to the report of an inquiry
by the National Weather Service, that it ``contributed to an
impression of certainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the report said, the 49-foot figure ``created a sense
of complacency,'' because t was only a fraction of a foot higher
than the record flood of 1979, which the city had survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came down with this number and people fixated on it,''
Tom Mulhern, the Grand Forks communications officer, said in an
interview. The dikes protecting the city had been built up with
sandbags to contain a 52-foot crest, and everyone figured the town
was safe, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to know what might have happened had the
uncertainty of the forecast been better communicated. But it is
possible, said Mulhern, that the dikes might have been sufficiently
enlarged and people might have taken more steps to preserve their
possessions. As it was, he said, ``some people didn't leave till
the water was coming down the street.''

<P>
   Of all the emerging technologies in the biotech firmament, few
have been so controversial as antisense, the concept that small
snippets of DNA can serve as drugs by blocking the action of
specific genes.
</P>
<P>
   With the Food and Drug Administration's approval last month of
the world's first antisense drug, this technology took a big step
forward in critical acceptance and therapeutic significance.
</P>
<P>
   Antisense is an elegantly simple concept: by knocking out the
genes that instruct cells to produce disease-causing proteins, one
ought to be able to treat nearly any infection, inflammation or
cancer with minimal side effects. But producing and testing
antisense molecules has proven both difficult and costly, and the
field has been marked by repeated failures. Many scientists
questioned whether the technology would ever work at all.
</P>
<P>
   So for Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc., a tiny biotechnology company
based in Carlsbad, Calif., the FDA's approval of its drug on Aug.
24 is a sweet vindication. The FDA approved fomivirsen for the
treatment of CMV retinitis, a viral infection that often causes
blindness in AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
   Improved AIDS therapies have made this a relatively rare
condition, but Isis has other antisense drugs in clinical trials
for far more common illnesses, including rheumatoid arthritis,
various cancers and the devastating intestinal illness Crohn's
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think of this as the end of the beginning,'' for antisense,
said Dr. Stanley T. Crooke, a cancer specialist who left a position
as head of Smith Kline and French to found Isis in 1989. Nearly
4,000 people have safely taken antisense drugs as part of trials,
he said, and Isis has accumulated a vast library of animal data
showing activity against virus, inflammation and cancer, with
minimal side effects. ``In that context, I don't think any rational
person can conclude anything but that antisense works,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts differ as to who came up with the term antisense and
when, but it derives from the landmark discovery of the structure
of DNA by Dr. James Watson and Dr. Francis Crick in 1953. They
showed that the genetic code is stored in the nucleus of a cell in
a two-stranded form known as a double helix, and that this
information is carried to the outer, protein-producing regions of
the cell via a single-stranded messenger called mRNA, known as the
``sense'' strand. Most diseases occur when a pathogen or a gene
defect causes a cell to make aberrant proteins.
</P>
<P>
   Drs. Watson and Crick showed that DNA consisted of four
repeating chemical bases, or nucleotides, often referred to among
scientists by letter: A, for adenine; G, guanine; T, thymine, and
C, cytosine. They also showed that these bases bound with each
other in consistent and repeatable ways _ A to T, G to C _ a
process known as Watson/Crick hybridization.
</P>
<P>
   It did not take long for scientists to theorize that a
mirror-image sequence of DNA, an oligonucleotide, would bind with
and thus neutralize the sense strand _ thus ``antisense'' _
preventing the production of the encoded protein.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not until 1978 that Dr. Paul Zamecnik at Harvard
University demonstrated that thus intervening at the mRNA level
could produce an antiviral effect. And in the absence of efficient
means for synthesizing DNA, his work was not reproduced for many
years.
</P>
<P>
   Antisense might have remained a scientific curiosity but for the
invention and commercialization of automated DNA synthesis in 1987.
Molecules that had required months of skilled lab work could now be
obtained in large number at the push of a button.
</P>
<P>
   Academic researchers began ordering oligonucleotides by the
score to test against various genes, and a handful of startup
companies received venture capital to pursue antisense technology.
</P>
<P>
   But experts now say that the sudden broad availability of
oligonucleotides led to a lot of dubious science. Academic
researchers ``would order two or three antisense oligos and maybe
they would order a control and maybe not,'' said Arthur Krieg, a
professor of internal medicine at the University of Iowa and editor
of the journal Antisense and Nucleic Acid Drug Development. ``The
ones that didn't work they'd call a control, and the ones that did
maybe worked one time in eight,'' he said. Just 5 perdent to 10
percent of papers published during this time yielded reproducible
results, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the fledgling antisense companies were finding
the science far more challenging than they had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   The hurdles were many. Ordinary DNA could not be used as a drug
because the body is full of enzymes that break it down, so
oligonucleotides had first to be chemically modified, typically by
adding sulfur ions. But these sulfurized oligos, called
phosphorothioates, are sticky, binding promiscuously to enzymes,
proteases and proteins as well as mRNA, so further modification was
needed.
</P>
<P>
   No one knew whether oligos would penetrate cells, and once
inside, what part of the mRNA they should bind with. A typical
sense strand is 2000 bases in length, an antisense oligonucleotide
about 20 bases; pick the wrong complementary sequence for the
oligo, and while it may bind, it may not accomplish anything.
</P>
<P>
   Isis' scientists found that targeting was crucial, screening
dozens of possible sequences to find the one that best suppressed
the gene's activity.
</P>
<P>
   In frustration, two other antisense companies, Gilead Sciences
Inc. and Genta Inc., shifted their efforts to less-risky
technologies, while Hybridon Inc., the company founded by Zamecnik,
poured millions of dollars into an HIV therapy only to cancel the
project due to dose-related side effects.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Isis' first drug, a treatment for the human papilloma virus that
causes genital warts, had to be dosed so often to be effective that
it could not be a viable commercial product, and was withdrawn from
clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   At times it seemed as though antisense would fade away but for
Crooke's Ahab-like fixation on it. ``I don't think people ever
adequately estimated the complexity of tackling an entirely new
drug discovery. They ought to have expected multiple failures,'' he
said. ``In truth, in my own lab at Smith Kline we had tried to
reproduce some of the early data, and we had failed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What kept him committed was the promise of the technology to
treat chronic diseases, like inflammation and cancer, that are
ill-served by conventional drugs. Most drugs are indiscriminate,
killing healthy cells along with diseased cells. ``I came to the
conclusion that if we were to make major advances against chronic
diseases, we needed a quantum advance in specificity,'' he said.
``Chronic diseases are by nature minimal deviation diseases because
if biology deviates a lot you get acutely ill and die,'' he said.
``We needed drugs that could affect one or two members of a
multi-gene family and not the others.''
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists say it is not clear that fomivirsen proves that
antisense works, for two reasons: one, because it is injected
directly into the eye, it circumvents some of the questions about
oligonucleotides' ability to reach a disease site; two, because
there is no way short of performing an autopsy to measure gene or
protein expression in the eye, there is no proof that it is working
by antisense and not some other unknown mechanism of action.
</P>
<P>
   Crooke said the company's animal trials have shown
unquestionable antisense activity, and that the drugs currently in
clinical trials for cancer and inflammatory diseases, which are
administered systemically, should lay remaining doubts to rest.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, fomivirsen's success as a drug has rekindled
interest in the field. An antisense conference in London next month
sold out months in advance, and features talks by representatives
of more than a dozen companies and academic institutions. Work on
so-called second or third generation antisense molecules, which are
based on different chemistry and could be dosed less frequently or
in oral formulations, proceeds at Isis, Hybridon, and Inex
Pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the strongest boost to antisense will come from the
Human Genome Project, the multinational effort to spell out the
sequence of every gene in the body. As the public and private
genome centers crank out newly discovered genes, antisense is often
the most efficient way to gauge their function and significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a technology that fits perfectly with genomics,'' said
Robert Glazer, a professor of pharmacology at Georgetown University
Medical Center, who has directed early trials of Isis' anticancer
drugs. ``The more they know about genes and how they function in
the malignant process, the easier it will be to design antisense
drugs. When the whole of the human genome is known, there ought to
be targets for every malignancy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes antisense will be the right drug to hit those targets,
and sometimes it will point the way to a different drug, said Paul
L. Herrling, director of research for Novartis AG, the Swiss
pharmaceuticals giant, which has both partnered with Isis and is
developing its own antisense program. ``Antisense is simply the way
to knock out the expression of a gene whenever you want, and you
can actually turn it on again when you stop treatment,'' he said.
``It can be a tool to find out what that gene does, and in the end
it can be the drug, too.''

DWINDLING DIET MAIN REASON FOR SMALLER DEERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ We were tracking a clear game trail and
wondered: How close could the deer be? How big? How dramatic the
antlers?
</P>
<P>
   The game trail led us first through forest, mixed cedars and
ponderosa pines, where we found fresh droppings _ so the deer could
not be far off. The route then fed us down to a small creek,
apparently their watering hole, and after crossing, we followed the
trail to a nearby clearing, bordered on three sides by high brush.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the wild grass was 3-feet high, but mashed right down to
the ground in a 25-foot circle. You could sense this was the spot
where a small deer herd had been bedding down, a perfect spot, with
plenty of food, protection and nearby water. We hid nearby, then
waited. Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Finally we gave up and retraced our steps, enjoying the evening.
We were gazing at some bubble-like cumulus that were building on
the ridge to the west, when suddenly, to our left, four deer
emerged in a clearing. They froze for a moment, one buck among
them, and then went bounding off into forest.
</P>
<P>
   Being able to track deer, to see the world on their terms, can
be one of the most satisfying moments in the great outdoors. You
have to be part detective, woodsman and athlete. After a long
stalk, you feel closer to the natural world, more a part of the
Earth, and it can be an exhilarating feeling that stays with you
for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   But disappointment? Of the four deer we saw, all were very small
blacktail, all well under 100 pounds, including this spindly
looking, forked-horn buck, something like a great dane with little
horns. I've had days where I've stalked and spotted 200 deer, once
more than 500, and they all seemed to be very small, with very few
antlers, as if they were all stunted.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the truck, we wondered, ``Why are California deer often
so small?'' The next day, I called California deer expert Paul
Wertz and asked him the same question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents were right all along,'' he answered. ``Healthy
diets build strong bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   He then said the state Department of Fish and Game had the same
question about deer, so department officials have been conducting a
deer nutrition study. It started when five fawns, two blacktails
and three mule deer were captured in the remote Warner Mountains of
Modoc County, then raised in captivity, kept in a pen and fed a
high-nutrition diet, primarily Purina high-protein deer chow mixed
with alfalfa.
</P>
<P>
   Now get this: After 2 1/2 years, the blacktails averaged 185
pounds, the mule deer averaged 260 pounds, the biggest with 4x4
antlers that measured 22 inches long with a circumference of more
than 4 inches at the base.
</P>
<P>
   You could go a lifetime and never see deer like this in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Wertz said the size of deer and their antlers is a product of
both genetics and nutrition, and that the current study is
documenting the effects of available food and nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, it explains why a long-term decline in the amount of
food available for deer has caused so many to be so small, from the
foothills of the San Francisco Bay across to alpine ridges in the
Sierra, Cascade and Shasta-Siskiyous.
</P>
<P>
   The primary diet of deer is composed of acorns from oak trees in
the winter, newly sprouted grass, plants and budding hardwoods in
spring (as it arrives along migration routes from low to high
elevations from March through July), and berries, apples and
flowers in mid-to-late summer.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, these food sources have been depleted. Oak trees
have been cut for firewood. Many budding plants get mowed down by
grazing cattle. Other habitat on migration routes has been
destroyed by new construction or by giant farms.
</P>
<P>
   In the alpine zone, forests that once included hardwoods and
browse have been clear-cut and replaced with rows of pine trees,
mono-cultures that provide no food. Timber operations have also
sprayed herbicides to reduce brush that kills off browse. And the
suppression of fire has resulted in little regeneration of habitats
in many alpine areas.
</P>
<P>
   For biologists, Wertz explained it very clearly: ``Millions of
acres of California deer habitat have the capacity to support tens
of thousands more deer, including many large deer, if such factors
as conservation of critical deer habitats and fire are allowed to
be part of the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   It is always exciting to find a game trail, then try to track
the animals, perhaps even spotting and stalking them. But when it
comes to deer, your best chance at seeing a trophy isn't in the
wild, but in a DFG pen, right next to a bin filled with Purina deer
chow.

`FELICITY' WITH A ``VENGEANCE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; One is a young woman who is just setting out to
find herself. The other, a grizzled vigilante.
</P>
<P>
   Together they fight crime.
</P>
<P>
   OK, they don't.
</P>
<P>
   But, separately they join the television schedule tonight. &QL; 
FELICITY &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The WB network continues to solidify its position as the leader
among the post-puberty set.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Felicity,'' it has a drama that's better executed and more
believable than its current signature show ``Dawson's Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   Whereas members of the crowd in the sleepy Cape Cod village
often speak with wisdom well beyond their years to create a teen
fantasy, ``Felicity'' oozes with realism and the grit of its New
York setting.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one sure hit of the new season, this is it. The
18-to-34-year-old crowd that the WB is after will flock to this
show like it's the mall during spring break. Older adults also will
find this an intelligent, intricate program worth their time.
</P>
<P>
   Felicity Porter (Keri Russell) is beautiful, smart and _ until
the pilot episode _ does everything expected of her. But, all of a
sudden the high school's most popular boy (the square-jawed,
cleft-chinned, mop-haired Ben Covington, played by Scott Speedman)
pays her a little attention, and she drops her plans to go to
Stanford to become a doctor and goes to the University of New York
(not to be confused with NYU).
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' she says, ``it's the small decisions that can
pretty much change your life forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the small decision wasn't her shift in colleges, it
was asking Ben to sign her yearbook. In his inscription, he shows
his interest in her.
</P>
<P>
   If you think that is a bit far-fetched, take the leap with her,
it's worth it. Based on the first hour, this good-looking show is
the best written of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Feature-film writers J.J. Abrams and Matt Reeves take you inside
the head of a college freshman the way David Kelley gives you
insight into young professional women in ``Ally McBeal.'' The main
difference between the two shows: Where ``McBeal'' often plays for
laughs, ``Felicity'' is a far more serious drama.
</P>
<P>
   The device used to get inside her head is not the sight gags and
such that you see on ``McBeal.'' Felicity corresponds with her
French tutor (the voice of Janeane Garofalo) in Santa Fe, N.M., via
cassette tape. The oral letters double as narration throughout the
episode, but it is not as awkward as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   One problem, however, is that Russell is too appealing to have
been hardly noticed by high school boys.
</P>
<P>
   You will care what happens to Felicity, struggle with her and
cheer for her.
</P>
<P>
   In four years, you will make sure to watch her ``very special
graduation episode.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   VENGEANCE UNLIMITED &QC;
</P>
<P>
   If you'd rather watch do-gooders than NBC's Thursday-night
lineup, you likely will watch ``Promised Land'' instead of
``Vengeance Unlimited.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Vengeance'' stars gravelly voiced Michael Madsen as Mr.
Chapel, a man who hates to see criminals work the system.
</P>
<P>
   Without the aid of a gun, he uses other means to threaten, bully
and intimidate people who get away with murder.
</P>
<P>
   Surely this show is inspired by the rage white America had when
O.J. Simpson was found innocent of double homicide.
</P>
<P>
   Chapel has no first name and no back story. He charges $1
million for his services, and if you don't have it, you have to
agree to do him a favor at a future date. Vito Corleone was never
so persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by KC Griffin (Kathleen York), a paralegal in the district
attorney's office, he helps those who, shattered by tragedy, have
found no help from the cops or the courts.
</P>
<P>
   While Madsen is a fine actor, he plays a much better bad guy
than good guy. The show is very dark, and his smoky voice gets
grating after a while.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday nights have been a graveyard for ABC dramas. The
network has killed off far better shows _ ``My So-Called Life'' and
``Nothing Sacred'' _ by putting it up against NBC's juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Chapel may not be long for this schedule. Criminals rejoice.
</P>
<P>
   The &UR;  &LR; show &UR; : &LR;  ``Vengeance Unlimited.''
</P>
<P>
   What &UR; : &LR;  A drama about Mr. Chapel, a man who doesn't like bad
guys. He doesn't use a gun, but that doesn't mean he is not an
imposing figure trying to bring justice to a world in which he
thinks there is too little.

<TEXT>
<P>
   You may wonder why I would write a health column about malaria
when there is no malaria in the United States. Well, that is only
partly true. Malaria is not endemic in this country or to Canada or
Europe. But one-third of the world's population lives where the
malaria parasite and its carrier mosquitoes thrive, and every year
more than 1 million Americans travel to those areas for business or
pleasure. Malaria, it seems, is gaining ground annually as control
efforts become more costly and cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide there are 300 million to 500 million cases of malaria
and 2 million to 3 million deaths from the disease each year. And
each year the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta receives reports of 1,000 to 1,200 cases of malaria that
were acquired abroad but diagnosed in this country. A malaria
expert at the centers, Dr. Trenton Ruebush, estimates that an equal
number of unreported cases occur among United States residents. But
Ruebush said that all malaria deaths that occur in the United
States, normally four or five a year, are probably reported.
</P>
<P>
   Why so many cases, and why should anyone die of a disease that
doctors have long known how to cure? Because many people outside
the endemic areas do not take malaria seriously and ignore the
measures recommended to prevent it or are careless about them. When
the flu-like symptoms of malaria develop, they are often not acted
on soon enough. In addition, outside of endemic areas, doctors
often fail to recognize the symptoms of malaria and thus do not
make the correct diagnosis or treat the disease properly or quickly
enough to cure it.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters, preventive measures have gotten trickier
and much more costly in recent years, ever since the malaria
parasite in most areas developed resistance to chloroquine, the
inexpensive and well-tolerated medication that had long been used
to prevent and treat malaria. Current options cost a lot more and
are associated with potentially more serious side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, there is currently no effective anti-malarial
vaccine, nor is there one on the immediate horizon, despite efforts
by scientists in the United States and elsewhere to uncover the
parasite's Achilles heel and block its ability to flourish in the
human body.
</P>
<P>
   A WILY PARASITE
</P>
<P>
   Malaria is a disease of the tropics and subtropics. Its range
extends as far north as the Mediterranean, Middle East, Mexico,
Northern India and China and as far south as South Africa,
Argentina and New Guinea. There are four types of the malaria
parasite that normally infect people, and only one _ Plasmodium
falciparum _ is potentially deadly. P. falciparum flourishes in
Africa, where it is responsible for 95 percent of cases. In fact,
Ruebush said, 90 percent of all malaria infections and 90 percent
of malaria deaths occur in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In other endemic areas, falciparum malaria is responsible for 5
percent to 50 percent of cases. The other three types, P. vivax, P.
ovale and P. malariae, are far less virulent, although they can
make their victims quite miserable for varying lengths of time.
</P>
<P>
   As Dr. Robert S. Desowitz, an expert in tropical diseases,
explains in his engrossing book ``The Malaria Capers'' (W.W.
Norton, 1991), a malaria infection in humans begins when an
infected female Anopheles mosquito, seeking a blood meal to foster
the development of her eggs, injects into the human bloodstream
threadlike malaria parasites called sporozoites that have been
stored in her salivary glands.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of sporozoites are usually injected into the blood
with one mosquito bite, and they quickly invade the cells in the
liver where they multiply. In this period, the infected person
experiences no symptoms. The first symptoms appear about 10 to 35
days later when the liver cells burst and the spores enter the
blood stream, causing intense chills and sweating with high fever.
Then the symptoms come and go _ usually in 24- to 72-hour cycles _
as the tiny parasites feed on the oxygen-carrying hemoglobin of the
infected person's red blood cells. Each cycle can render the victim
more anemic with less and less oxygen reaching the brain and other
vital tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Ruebush said that two of the nondeadly species could remain
alive in a person's liver for up to a couple of years, periodically
causing relapses of malarial symptoms. The other nonfatal form can
hide in the body outside the liver for up to 30-40 years, waiting
for some unknown signal to trigger its emergence and cause a
recurrence of symptoms. The deadly species, P. falciparum, causes
the most severe symptoms, but if the victim does not get treated
and does not die, the infection burns itself out within a year or
two.
</P>
<P>
   PREVENTION AND TREATMENT
</P>
<P>
   Since there is no vaccine against malaria, prevention depends on
two important measures: taking a drug that combats the parasite
prophylactically _ that is, in advance of any known infection _ and
avoiding bites by the Anopheles mosquito. In the few areas where
there is still little or no chloroquine resistance, this drug is
taken weekly starting one week prior to departure for the endemic
area, weekly while there and for four weeks after returning home.
</P>
<P>
   For most endemic areas where chloroquine-resistant parasites
flourish, the Centers for Disease Control now recommends
mefloquine, sold under the trade name of Lariam. This drug is taken
one time a week before departure, each week while in the malaria
area and for four weeks after returning. It is extremely effective
but expensive _ about $7 a tablet _ so for a two-week trip the cost
is about $50.
</P>
<P>
   Lariam can sometimes cause anxiety, depression, hallucinations
and insomnia, and in one in 10,000 or 15,000 cases, these side
effects are incapacitating. A trip-mate of mine to Panama developed
sky-high blood pressure, fever, shaking chills, severe anxiety,
hallucinations and was unable to walk on her own, all attributed to
Lariam. It took her months to recover.
</P>
<P>
   An equally effective alternative to Lariam is doxycycline, which
is recommended for northern Thailand, where mefloquine resistance
has been detected. Doxycycline has to be taken daily, starting one
to two days before departure and continued for four weeks after
returning. Anyone who chooses doxycycline must be very
conscientious about taking it every day; if you miss a couple of
days, you are unprotected. Among the possible side effects are
upset stomach, yeast infection in women and increased sensitivity
to the sun _ which means you must remain covered to avoid a severe
sunburn.
</P>
<P>
   A standby treatment is the drug Fansidar, which can cause rather
severe skin rashes. It is used only as an emergency treatment,
should symptoms suspicious of malaria develop when the person is
far from medical care. But even if one takes Fansidar, it is vital
to get to a doctor for thorough treatment as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Ruebush emphasized that preventive medication is only one
measure. Travelers should be aware of the habits of the Anopheles
mosquito, which typically reigns in rural areas and bites between
dusk and dawn (although in heavily shaded jungle areas it may bite
in daylight). Use of protective clothing and insect repellent and a
mosquito net over the bed at night (preferably first dipped in a
solution of insecticide) are important parts of malaria prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who develops a fever a week to a month after being in an
area where malaria is a problem must report immediately to a
doctor, who should do a blood smear right away. As Ruebush said,
``Malaria is eminently curable if it is caught early and treated
appropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   Many large cities now have clinics that advise travelers and
administer vaccines. State and local health departments may also be
helpful. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta
has a malaria hotline _ 770-488-7788 _ that can be reached 24 hours
a day every day and where callers can request a faxed copy of
protective information.

<P>
   ARECIBO, P.R. _ Sorry guys,'' Jill C. Tarter said, cutting off
chitchat around the control panel, eager to hunt for alien
civilizations. ``We have the telescope.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside in the fading light, surrounded by dense jungle, the
receiving dome on the world's largest radiotelescope wheeled into
position. It fixed on Barnard's star, a scant six light-years away,
the closest star to Earth in the northern hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Closeness meant it had been searched before. But now, the great
dish antenna of the Arecibo observatory began to gather in a riot
of faint signals, giving the star its most discriminating look yet
for hints of invisible planets and intelligent life.
</P>
<P>
   Tense with concentration, Dr. Tarter, 54, closely examined the
colored spikes that slowly materialized on her monitor. Each was a
candidate, a possible hello from afar. But in the next hour and a
half, she, a colleague and a nearby supercomputer rejected them,
one by one. The signals turned out to be cosmic static and earthly
interference.
</P>
<P>
   She showed no sign of frustration _ no sigh, joke or frown. A
true believer, she just plowed ahead to examine a night full of
stars, sure that some day there would be proof that humans were not
alone in the universe.
</P>
<P>
   The search for extraterrestrial intelligence, or SETI, is at a
turning point after nearly four decades of hard work. With the
arrival here of Dr. Tarter and her crew from the SETI Institute in
Mountain View, Calif., the field has reached a high point in terms
of telescope sensitivity, a top goal of the alien hunters.
</P>
<P>
   But it has found no extraterrestrials so far, despite forecasts
that they should have been discovered by now. Instead, it has
probed the heavens with regularity and heard nothing but a dead
silence.
</P>
<P>
   While pressing the hunt here at Arecibo, Dr. Tarter and her
peers around the globe are engaged in quiet debate and soul
searching over how to proceed. New ideas and strategies are being
weighed, including expansions that would enhance telescope
sensitivity and widen the hunt to more stars _ perhaps 100,000
rather than the 1,000 now targeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get far into a project and haven't found what you're
looking for, it gives you pause,'' Seth Shostak, a SETI Institute
scientist, said as he trudged down a hillside into the lush bowl
that holds the telescope's huge receiving dish, the size of 26
football fields.
</P>
<P>
   Does the silence bother him?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a funny thing,'' Shostak replied. ``You'd think it gets
old. But it doesn't. The equipment keeps getting better and the
odds keep getting better, which never happens in Vegas. Also, there
are always new ideas. This is a field with new papers, new
meetings, new people _ which is remarkable considering there is no
data. So for me, it's not discouraging at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Close up, the great antenna was a grayish sea of perforated
aluminum panels, thousands of them. High overhead, a cable car
hauled engineers toward the central receiving dome to do daytime
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Shostak strode under the dish into dim sunlight and surprisingly
dense foliage.
</P>
<P>
   Any boa constrictors down there?
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing is the mud,'' he called back confidently.
</P>
<P>
   Like most SETI enthusiasts, Shostak and Dr. Tarter believe it is
just a matter of time before earthlings use such antennas to make
contact with aliens. Their faith is rooted in numbers, big ones.
The Milky Way is estimated to have 400 billion stars, including the
Sun.
</P>
<P>
   SETI scientists believe that many of these stars have planets
orbiting them as well as advanced forms of life _ an idea skeptics
deride.
</P>
<P>
   Alien civilizations in the galaxy are likely to number anywhere
from 10,000 to one million, SETI enthusiasts say. If the higher
density is right, that means advanced beings would inhabit about
one in every 400,000 stars. The implication is that even a slow,
detailed, comprehensive search from Earth would be mostly a
wasteland of late nights, false leads and frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may look empty, but it's not,'' Shostak said as he sipped a
root beer in the observatory's cafeteria, eager to cool off from
the wet heat outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, maybe this is a hopeless task, maybe it's impossible,'' he
conceded. ``On the other hand, maybe it's like discussing the
possibility of whether there's a continent between Europe and Asia
in the cafes of Segovia in the 1400s. Until you do the experiment,
you don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The first SETI hunt began in humble circumstances in the
Allegheny Mountains of West Virginia. In 1960, Dr. Frank D. Drake,
a young scientist at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory
there, used an 85-foot antenna to listen around a few stars for
alien transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, a main SETI strategy has been to wield increasingly
big radiotelescopes, their size allowing them to gather
increasingly faint signals. The dish antenna at Arecibo, 1,000 feet
wide, is the biggest of them all.
</P>
<P>
   SETI work started here with a bang. In 1974, at the urging of
Drake, who then ran the observatory, the newly upgraded dish at
Arecibo was used to beam a powerful, three-minute message at M13, a
dense cluster of hundreds of thousands of stars orbiting the Milky
Way. The message was a simple graphic showing the telescope as well
as facts about the solar system and humans.
</P>
<P>
   The message is still zooming outward. At the speed of light, it
will reach M13 in about 21,000 years. A reply from any alens in
that neighborhood would presumably take a similarly long time.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tarter got hooked on the field in the mid-1970s, soon after
the message was sent. She was then a young astronomer at the
University of California at Berkeley. After reading a SETI report,
she teamed up with another astronomer to hunt for aliens with the
university's 85-foot telescope.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was brave of Jill,'' Drake said in his autobiography,
noting that SETI work back then could hurt a developing career.
</P>
<P>
   By 1985, Dr. Tarter was a senior SETI scientist at the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration. She and her colleagues built
powerful computers to sift through cosmic and earthly interference
and lined up many radiotelescopes, including Arecibo. Their goal
was to survey 1,000 nearby stars, all within 200 light-years of
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the big search was ready to start. And Drake, the SETI
pioneer, gave it a drum roll in his autobiography, ``Is Anyone Out
There?'' (Delacorte Press, 1992, written with Dava Sobel), saying
the find of all time was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``This discovery,'' he wrote, ``which I fully expect to witness
before the year 2000, will profoundly change the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But the plug was pulled suddenly in 1993 when Congress decided
that SETI was a waste of public money.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, Drake and Dr. Tarter took the hunt private at the
SETI Institute. They won substantial support from a handful of
silicon moguls, capitalized on the $58 million the government had
invested in gear and forged ahead with the planned search. In 1995,
they began roving from telescope to telescope.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tarter, who heads Project Phoenix, as the hunt is known, is
famous for her zeal. She was the role model for Ellie, the heroine
of the 1997 movie ``Contact,'' based on Carl Sagan's novel,
starring Jodie Foster. The two met when it was filmed at Arecibo.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a fantastic person,'' Dr. Tarter said of Ms. Foster.
``She wanted to know what astronomers are like, and do they have
big egos.'' She laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing sandals, her hair tied in a pony tail, Dr. Tarter along
with her institute colleagues started observing here Sept. 9. It
was the team's first return since the federal plug was pulled. A
new agreement gives them 2,000 hours of observing time, or about a
half-year's worth of 12-hour night shifts, which they plan to
spread over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   A big lure is the new sensitivity of the telescope at Arecibo,
which is run by Cornell University in cooperation with the National
Science Foundation. Last year, work here was finished on a
five-year, $27 million face lift that quadrupled the telescope's
ability to pull in faint signals.
</P>
<P>
   As always, the hunt focuses on close stars, since signals from
their inhabited planets would be strongest. And it concentrates on
ones similar to the Sun, the only star known to support life.
Lastly, it tends to search older stars, since it assumes advanced
life takes a long time to evolve.
</P>
<P>
   At Arecibo, candidate alien signals are compared with readings
from a radiotelescope nearly halfway around the world at Jodrell
Bank in Britain. The comparison helps identify and rule out local
earthly interference, which is exploding with the rise in
satellites and cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is some hellacious thing,'' Dr. Tarter said as she glared
at an interference spike. ``It produces system indigestion.''
</P>
<P>
   Around midnight on Sept. 15, Dr. Tarter and Shostak were
searching for aliens living around EQ Pegasi, an unremarkable star
21 light-years away. Suddenly, the team's automatic search program
started moving the telescope off the star, seeking to find out if a
strong incoming signal was simply terrestrial interference.
</P>
<P>
   The signal died away, as it would if it originated from the
star. And it returned when the telescope refocused on EQ Pegasi.
</P>
<P>
   Rising out of their chairs, electrified by the drama, the two
astronomers studied the signal's high rate of drift. That suggested
the transmitter was based on either a spinning satellite or a
rapidly turning planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had Jill and I stared any harder at that display screen, we
would have bored holes in the phosphor,'' Shostak recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the telescope was moved off target as the computer sought
to double-check the signal's place of origin. This time the signal
stayed on, meaning it was from a satellite.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big disappointment,'' Shostak admitted the next day.
``I thought, `Hey, this is the big one.' '' Only a few times before
had the team had such a sense of being on the verge of discovery.
</P>
<P>
   (Days later, on Sept. 21, Hurricane Georges slammed into the
area, uprooting trees, hurling debris that damaged some antenna
panels and temporarily disrupting the alien hunt, now set to resume
Thursday.)
</P>
<P>
   Their faith apparently intact, despite the long hours and
decades of failure, the alien hunters are planning in their spare
time a new generation of strategies and gear. A committee based at
the SETI Institute, including Dr. Tarter, Shostak and 31 other
experts, began meeting last year to chart a path into the future.
</P>
<P>
   At the controls of the Arecibo search, Dr. Tarter became quite
animated as she described futuristic arrays of hundreds and perhaps
even thousands of small dish antennas tied to one another
electronically, scanning the sky for the advanced civilizations she
knows are out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to grow this,'' she said of untried gear that one day
might dwarf Arecibo in terms of sensitivity. ``You have to crawl
before you walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Her ultimate dream is to build an observatory on the far side of
the Moon, free of earthly interference, scanning the heavens for an
unfamiliar hello. She wants to be there herself, at the controls.

MATERNAL BEHAVIOR DEPENDS ON DAD, AT LEAST AMONG MICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   (af)  
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How do mother mice know how to look after their babies when
there is no one to tell them what to do? By instinct, meaning that
their maternal behavior is in some way programmed into their genes.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists have now identified one gene involved. By a curious
twist the gene is one that is sculpted or imprinted by the father
in a special way, giving male mice a role in shaping the female's
maternal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Even though human behavior is far more flexible, a mother's
nurturing instincts may take place within the framework of the same
set of genes as exist in mice because mice and humans are very
similar on the genetic level. Indeed the human version of the mouse
gene is also known to be imprinted by the father.
</P>
<P>
   The gene's role in mice has been explored through a technique
impossible in humans, that of generating a strain of mice that
lacks the father's copy of the gene and seeing how the organism is
affected.
</P>
<P>
   Female mice that lack the paternal copy of the Mest gene, as it
is known, turn out to be bad mothers, indeed so downright
neglectful that their infants die. The mothers do not retrieve
their pups, they fail to remove and eat the placenta, and many do
not even build proper nests, biologists from the Wellcome/CRC
Institute in Cambridge, England, report in Tuesday's issue of
Nature Genetics.
</P>
<P>
   In normal mice, therefore, the paternal copy of the Mest gene
presumably promotes these behaviors. The copy from the mother's
side is inactive and cannot remedy the lack of the paternal copy.
The researchers note that the paternal Mest gene is active in cells
of the hypothalamus and amygdala, regions of the brain that are
believed to govern the mouse's reproductive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Usually both copies of a gene, the one that arrived via the
sperm and the one from the egg, are equally active. With a handful
of genes, known as imprinted genes, only one gene is active and the
other is gagged.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, researchers have found several paternally imprinted
genes whose effect is to promote growth in the fetus, as well as
maternally imprinted genes that retard fetal growth.
</P>
<P>
   Several explanations have been suggested for the existence of
imprinted genes but the neatest is one proposed by Dr. David Haig,
an evolutionary biologist at Harvard University. His theory is that
they embody a genetic conflict between parents and offspring. In
animals like mammals, pregnancy is a negotiation for nutrients
between the mother and the fetus.
</P>
<P>
   The imprinting mechanism would have evolved, Haig believes,
because in species where a mother has offspring by more than one
father, a male would gain an advantage if his infants grew at the
expense of the mother and of any future infants she might have by
another male.
</P>
<P>
   In a strange genetic arms race between the sexes, males imprint
genes so as to favor their progeny's fetal growth, even at the
mother's expense; females defend themselves with imprinted genes
that retard the fetus.
</P>
<P>
   Imprinted genes spring from parent-offspring conflict but are a
consequence of polygamy. If Haig's theory is correct, in other
words, a monogamous, mate-for-life species would gain no advantage
from imprints. Evidently neither mice nor humans fit this category.
</P>
<P>
   So far about 20 imprinted mouse genes have been detected. The
equivalent human genes are imprinted in about half the cases,
suggesting that both species, by the evidence of their genes, are
inclined to polygamy.
</P>
<P>
   The Cambridge biologists state that the absence of the Mest gene
retards growth in fetal mice, consistent with Haig's genetic
conflict theory. They also note that Mest is the first example of
an imprinted gene that extends beyond fetal growth effects to
influence mammalian behavior.
</P>
<P>
   This raises a serious puzzle, however. Although the authors
suggest that the gene's effect on nurturing behavior arises through
the same evolutionary pressures that cause fetal growth effects,
Haig is not so sure. His theory would not predict an effect of
imprinted genes on maternal behavior such as removing the placenta,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The human version of the Mest gene is also imprinted by the
male. Evidence that its role, as in mice, is to promote the fetus'
growth comes from a condition known as Silver-Russell syndrome, in
which fetal growth is retarded.
</P>
<P>
   In some Silver-Russell patients, by a series of genetic
accidents, both copies of chromosome 7, where the Mest gene is
located, come from the mother, suggesting that lack of a parental
copy of Mest may be the cause of fetal retardation.
</P>
<P>
   Do these patients also fail to bond with their infants? Dr. Azim
Surani, an author of the mouse work, said none had been noted so
far, but that they would be hard to spot, given the family and
social support that humans receive in rearing infants.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bridges, a neuroscientist at Tufts University, said that
humans are not as dependent as rodents are on genes and hormones
for stimulating the onset of parental care. ``But there is still
presumably a genetic underpinning to their response, so it's
conceivable that genes such as this one may set the tone for the
female's response,'' he said.

   ``Felicity'' is the prime cause of envy on network executive
rows this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The WB, television's most reliable laughingstock two seasons
ago, has it, and everyone else wishes they did. Imagine, NBC
envying the WB. It's like Mercedes-Benz wishing it were the Geo
Metro.
</P>
<P>
   Over at ABC, the envy is deep purple. The network, which seems
to make a habit of this sort of thing, turned ``Felicity'' down. I
suppose ``America's Funniest Home Videos'' already had the time
period sewn up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicity'' debuts Tuesday night, after a promotional barrage
in which actress Keri Russell's face seemed to grace every magazine
cover in America.
</P>
<P>
   Russell stars as a 17-year-old Palo Alto girl whose life pivots
on one mistake. But, as she tells her exasperated parents, it's
(set ital)her(end ital) mistake. She chucks sacred family plans for
her to enroll at Stanford and instead follows the boy she adored in
high school (Scott Speedman) to college in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Thing is, he wrote something flattering in her yearbook, but she
doesn't even know the guy. The first time she sees him at the
University of New York (a fictional twist on New York University),
he's clutching a girlfriend and can't remember Felicity's name.
Oops.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Felicity is given to furrowing her brow and sighing. A
sigh, in fact, is her first act in the entire series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicity'' has been likened to ``Ally McBeal,'' though
``Felicity'' is pure drama. And ``Felicity'' is far sweeter than
the overly lamented ``My So-Called Life.''
</P>
<P>
   You might recall that in ``My So-Called Life,'' 15-year-old
Angela Chase (Claire Danes) could have moped about a blue sky and
balmy breeze. ``I cannot bring myself to eat a well-balanced meal
in front of my mother,'' she groused to us. ``It just means too
much to her. I mean, if you stop to think about, like, chewing,
what it really is ...''
</P>
<P>
   And so on. But it didn't matter. ``My So-Called Life'' might
have been about a 15-year-old, but the whole show deserved a
spanking. Which, of course, the Nielsen ratings gave it.
</P>
<P>
   Felicity Porter doesn't whine. She's an innocent, and she's
likable for it. She'll scrape and bow and smile awkwardly and
sometimes erupt in anger, then she'll figure out what's wrong and
do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   She isn't cynical; that's the key difference. I don't know
whether that makes Felicity Porter more or less realistic than
Angela Chase. But I do know it makes her more tolerable to a wider
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicity'' is the creation of two young screenwriters, J.J.
Abrams (``Regarding Henry,'' ``Forever Love'' and, gulp,
``Armageddon'') and Matt Reeves (``The Pallbearer'').
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's their relative unfamiliarity with TV, but Abrams and
Reeves almost miraculously escape pigeonholing ``Felicity'' for a
teen demographic. Teens and viewers in their early 20s may be the
target audience, but there is a palpable universality to Felicity's
travails as a college freshman. No matter your age, ``Felicity''
won't deal you out.
</P>
<P>
   Speedman's character, Ben Covington, evolves uneasily into
Felicity's friend. The circle also includes Amy Jo Johnson as Julie
Emrick, apparently destined to become Felicity's best friend, and
Scott Foley as Noel Crane, Felicity's resident dorm adviser and
instant admirer. Another character, Tangi Miller as fellow student
Elena Tyler, will turn up in future episodes.
</P>
<P>
   But it's Russell, 22, who gives ``Felicity'' its magnetism.
</P>
<P>
   She's been in a few shows _ NBC's ``Malibu Shores'' is one _
long enough to hint that she'd carve a career based on looks more
than ability. Now, suddenly, somehow, Russell is an actress. Too
practiced and cutesy at times, with the indulgent camera drawn
tight into her gorgeous face, but never really short of her
emotional mark.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the show's expansive appeal, I think, is that Russell
doesn't look like the college student of the 1990s. She looks like
any time. She looks like then, she looks like now, she looks like
all time.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   _ However much ``Felicity'' lacks cynicism, ``Vengeance
Unlimited'' (Tuesday on ABC) embodies it.
</P>
<P>
   Cool star, though. Michael Madsen (``Reservoir Dogs''), as the
mysterious vigilante Mr. Chapel, has a wonderful film noir voice
and a presence that keeps you guessing. Is this guy here to help
me, or kill me?
</P>
<P>
   He materializes with offers to avenge crimes in which the bad
guy escaped justice. His fee is $1 million _ or, more often, an
unspecified ``favor'' to be paid later.
</P>
<P>
   His own clients seem terrified of him. His methods aren't
exactly the stuff of Marquis of Queensbury propriety _ kidnapping,
breaking and entering, assault and more.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is wrong with you?'' a former client asks Mr. Chapel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plenty,'' he replies. No argument here.
</P>
<P>
   Who Mr. Chapel is, and why he does what he does, apparently will
remain a mystery. Unless maybe the producers grow deeply desperate
in a few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vengeance Unlimited'' might attract a cult following on a
guilty- pleasure basis. Come see tough guy Madsen smite the wicked
and rub the faces of the arrogantly guilty in the ooze of their own
gore.
</P>
<P>
   Ahem.
</P>
<P>
   More probably, it'll be bloodied itself in its regular 8 p.m.
Tuesday time slot. Say, didn't that used to be the ``family hour''?

VOICE OF THE VALLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Breakfast has arrived at Nat's Early Bite Coffee
Shoppe in Van Nuys, and Sandra Tsing Loh is hungry. But not for
your typical L.A. power fare of fat-free yogurt and wheatgrass
juice.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with her image as patron saint of the
downwardly-mobile-and-proud, Loh's going for the heart-attack
special: two eggs over easy with hash browns and a slab of sizzled
meat, which she proceeds to shower liberally with Tabasco sauce and
ketchup.
</P>
<P>
   The spartan, strip-mall diner is one of Loh's favorite haunts,
and the author-performer is only too happy to regale a pair of
first-time visitors with the decor's finer points.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I love about Van Nuys,'' she says, segueing
into &UR;  &LR; a favorite theme. ``You won't see Tina Turner in here, you'll
see Ike (whose 8-by-10 glossy adorns the wall) ... Whereas, if you
saw someone at the Beverly Center, you'd have to get all dressed
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past half-dozen years, Loh has built a fairly
comfortable career from such casually offbeat observations. While
many cultural commentators regurgitate warmed-over anecdotes about
L.A.'s swankier precincts, Loh has staked out the less fashionable
turf of the San Fernando Valley and made it her personal calling
card.
</P>
<P>
   In her former ``Valley'' column for the preternaturally hip,
now-defunct Buzz magazine, Loh repeatedly rose to the defense of
the oft-mocked area, for which she has suggested the streamlined
name of ``SFV,'' a la KFC. With tongue only partly in cheek, she
has touted the Valley as a hotbed of Middle American normalcy,
rather than the existential cul-de-sac of a million Johnny Carson
jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Where others have seen only Fatburger stands and cookie-cutter
tract homes, Loh has unearthed a gold mine of comic material. She
can sound downright lyrical when it comes to the Valley, a place
where ``the off-ramps for Reseda, Tarzana and Winnetka ring out
like a kind of lonesome cowboy refrain,'' where thousands of failed
screenwriters and would-be rock stars can come lick their wounds
and fade into safe, suburban anonymity, all within a freeway exit
or two of Ralphs and IKEA.
</P>
<P>
   Those are not recommendations to be taken lightly, Loh
maintains, in the downsized world in which so many post-boomers now
find themselves struggling to stay afloat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a comfortable place to live. It's grounded,'' Loh, 36,
says of the Valley, where she shares a bungalow with her musician
husband. ``So if you need to be fabulous, to go into the Bermuda
Triangle of Beverly Hills-San Vicente, where you can have French
doormen spitting on you ... If you do need to do that once a month,
you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Adopting the bemused persona of a frumpy perpetual underdog, Loh
is the author of a novel and a 1996 collection of columns, ``Depth
Takes a Holiday: Essays From Lesser Los Angeles'' (Riverhead
Books). The latter, a local best seller, recounts the joys of life
among the un-chic.
</P>
<P>
   After Buzz folded earlier this year, Loh decided to give her
Valley Girl alter ego a bit of a rest. In ``The Loh Life,'' her
weekly commentaries for KCRW-FM (89.9), which also appear
nationally on NPR's ``All Things Considered,'' she has turned
toward such subjects as how much classier Bill Clinton would've
looked if he'd picked Jacqueline Bisset over Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But she still champions her home turf, much to the continuing
horror of her Westside bohemian pals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, people are like, `You still live in the Valley?' They
thought it was like a gimmick to get a column and that by now I
would live in Coldwater Canyon. I'm such a suburban person. I like
to shop. I like to go to Trader Joe's.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a good line _ so good you can understand why Loh keeps
repeating it, or variations thereof. And therein, perhaps, lies the
rub: How do you keep your street credibility when popular culture
has embraced you as a walking intellectual property?
</P>
<P>
   This Sunday, for example, Loh will be opening her one-woman
show, ``Bad Sex With Bud Kemp,'' at the Tiffany Theaters in West
Hollywood, following its successful Manhattan engagement last
spring.
</P>
<P>
   The fictional Bud Kemp, Loh explains, is a composite of two
Caltech engineers ``who shall remain nameless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the idea of `Bud Kemp' is when you've been good
friends with someone for eight years and all your friends have kind
of drifted away and gotten married or whatever. And you're out on a
Friday or Saturday night and everyone's been drinking, and you
think, `Let's do it,' you know, `Why not?' And then you realize
maybe there's a reason why there was no spark there for eight
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The 75-minute piece is being produced by HBO Independent
Productions. Loh acknowledges she's got some TV deals cooking with
HBO and DreamWorks but declines to give details.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to work for the corporation, but not the Death
Star,'' she says. Loh's facility for impromptu wit has even landed
her on CNN. She was chagrined, however, when her image was
superimposed over the inevitable backdrop of the Hollywood sign.
</P>
<P>
   What separates Loh from the mass of run-of-the-mill '90s
ironists is that her humor never reeks of hostility or
condescension. Self-deprecating almost to a fault, she casts
herself as the butt-end of her down-and-out tales of failed
romantic trysts or living in a battered Canoga Park home with
``cottage-cheese ceilings that sparkled as gaily as a mirrored
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   As a humorist, she thinks, ``it's much more fun to implicate
oneself'' in humanity's ritual humiliations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have movie deals and book deals now, but I still feel I'm
dressed wrong when I go to the meetings,'' she says. ``If you get
invited to the party, you don't get to go in the VIP lounge. And if
you get to go in the VIP lounge, you don't get to be Robert
Redford. So there's always that feeling that I think is very easy
to preserve all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   David Schweizer, who's directing ``Bad Sex With Bud Kemp,'' says
that despite her growing acclaim, Loh has maintained an outsider's
outlook on life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what keeps people professionally lively in that regard
is if they have kind of an internal curiosity, a kind of
questioning bug about the culture that's not really going to let
them go,'' he says. ``Yes, it's become a sort of style, you know,
`Sandra Loh lives in the Valley.' But Sandra is, it seems to me,
still surprised by what she sees.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeling like a foreigner, even in her hometown, comes naturally
to Loh. High school was her Rosebud, and her experiences there
apparently hardened her worldview like a Kool-Aid Popsicle. Back
then, Loh's father worked in the aerospace industry, meaning the
family could afford a home in Malibu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was around cool kids all the time, the cool kids, aka `not
me,' who were always going off with Ali MacGraw in the back of the
Mercedes,'' Loh recalls. High school, she says, was ``just a chaos
of unfocused activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Loh eventually found her focus in a USC master's program in
writing, after earning a bachelor's degree in science and English
at Caltech. But before she decided to fix on writing, Loh took a
stab at performance art.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, she regaled Harbor Freeway drivers by playing a heavily
amplified solo piano concerto from the nearby Citicorp Plaza
parking facility's upper deck. Two years later, she plunked down
$5,500 to hire the Topanga Symphony to provide musical
accompaniment for the annual grunion spawning at Malibu's Surfrider
Beach. Those 15 minutes of fame mostly succeeded in giving local
media a way to typecast Loh as a self-promoting kook.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of a Chinese father and a German mother, Loh
remains a trenchant critic of political correctness and its
discontents. Her definitive word on the subject appears as the
controversial essay, ``Is This Ethnic Enough for You?'' in ``Depth
Takes a Holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   If Loh doesn't advocate following the herd, she does believe in
``the crippling financial sacrifices'' art demands _ at least up to
a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (people) have that dream, to be really creative but
not to suffer. They want to be writing _ but writing on
butcher-block furniture. It's kind of like the Gap ad fantasy of,
`I look cool, I'm really rich, and I'm writing a novel, and the
novel's going to be made into a movie, but I'm still a rebel'.''
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast is done, and it's time to repair for a photo session
at Loh's home, just a few blocks away. It's a charming 1920s
cottage, with a barbecue and an honest-to-goodness pool, set on a
leafy street that once abutted an agriculture station.
</P>
<P>
   Loh's new digs are a big step up from 1990, when she was living
in cheesy apartments, making $9,000 a year doing temp work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our house isn't camera-ready, and neither are we,'' she says
unapologetically. ``We're basically sweat pants and T-shirts from
one room to the next. We're total homebodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Which perhaps brings us back to hash browns and hot sauce. For
the first time in her life, Sandra Tsing Loh can afford to stay
hungry _ even while spicing things up in Van Nuys.

LACMA PLANS RIVERA EXHIBIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Following hard on the heels of its blockbuster Van
Gogh show scheduled to open in January, the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art will host a major retrospective of works by the
Mexican painter and muralist Diego Rivera this coming summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diego Rivera: Art and Revolution'' is being billed as the
first major U.S. exhibition on Rivera in 13 years. Opening May 30,
1999, it will trace his entire career, emphasizing his
contributions to muralism, symbolism, cubism, the post-World War I
``return to order,'' social realism and surrealism.
</P>
<P>
   Including more than 100 paintings, prints and drawings _ many on
loan from Mexico and never before seen in this country _ the
exhibition provides further evidence of LACMA's desire to attract
more visitors from L.A.'s burgeoning Latino population and to
examine Latin America's contribution to modern art. A recent LACMA
exhibition showcased its acquisition from the Bernard and Edith
Lewin collection of more than 2,000 paintings and works on paper by
such artists as Carlos Merida, David Alfaro Siquieros, Rivera and
Rufino Tamayo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This exhibition will allow us to explore the unique path
forged by Diego Rivera in the history of 20th-century art,'' said
LACMA director Graham W.J. Beal. ``The comprehensive collection of
works illustrates Rivera's many contributions to international
modernism.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1886, Rivera is associated with the golden age of
Mexican muralism, a synthesis of European art-historic influences,
socialist ideals and the heritage and forms of indigenous Mexico.
The exhibition begins with Rivera's student work in Mexico, then
follows his departure in 1907 to Europe to study painting. While
living in Paris, Rivera met Picasso, Leger, Modigliani and Chagall,
and by 1915 was well into his cubist phase.
</P>
<P>
   Later he spent an extensive sojourn in the United States where
he created numerous frescoes in New York, Detroit and San
Francisco, in imagery that fused Gaugin with Aztec and Mayan. Like
his late wife and fellow artist Frida Kahlo, Rivera is today
perhaps more popular than at any time since his death in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by the Consejo Nacional Para la Cultura y las Artes
through the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes (Mexico) and the
Cleveland Museum of Art, the exhibition will first visit Cleveland;
followed by LACMA; the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; and the Museo
del Palacio de Bellas Artes.
</P>
<P>
   LACMA officials said additional information about the show will
be released in coming weeks.

MOUNTAIN LIONS POSE A NEW THREAT TO BIGHORN SHEEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(lh) 
 By MARTIN FORSTENZER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BISHOP , Calif. _ Not long after settlers began streaming into
the West in the mid-1800s, bighorn sheep began disappearing.
Unregulated hunting took its toll, as did diseases spread by
domestic sheep.
</P>
<P>
   Some estimate that as little as 2 percent of the vast numbers of
bighorns of the West remain, but wildlife agencies in almost every
Western state have stabilized their numbers in recent years through
aggressive programs of reintroducing the animals to parts of their
native ranges. Still, even in states where bighorns are considered
to be doing well overall, individual herds are prone to
catastrophic die-offs, largely from diseases. Some herds may be
more susceptible to disease because they have been left isolated
from other herds by changing Western landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   But now herds are being hit hard by a new scourge _ one that few
would have predicted 15 years ago. Mountain lions, greatly
increased in number, have ravaged bighorn populations in several
parts of the West, but especially in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a single state in the West that hasn't had
problems with bighorn sheep,'' said Dr. John D. Wehausen, a
University of California bighorn sheep researcher. ``They've always
had a problem with disease, but what's new is this whole mountain
lion factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Bighorns have acquired a popular image as indestructible because
of the ferocious rutting battles in which rams charge head-on into
each other with loud crashes. Sturdy pickup trucks and rugged
football players take their names from the animals.
</P>
<P>
   But especially when they move to lower elevations in winter,
bighorns have little defense against mountain lions. Severe bighorn
declines are occurring in California, where biologists said the
expanded mountain lion population is threatening an entire bighorn
subspecies with extinction. The lions have also reduced the last
native New Mexico herd to a single ewe and cut one Colorado herd by
more than half.
</P>
<P>
   A wildlife study has shown that mountain lions once were held in
check by other large predators like wolves and grizzly bears, but
those predators were virtually eliminated by man in most of the
West. Bounties once paid for the big cats were discontinued decades
ago, and restrictions were placed on hunting.
</P>
<P>
   In California, a successful 1990 ballot initiative made it
illegal for anyone, including state wildlife officials, to kill a
mountain lion except in extreme situations. The number of lions is
up in the state and across the West, biologists said, resulting in
unexpected consequences for bighorns and other prey species.
</P>
<P>
   In the Sierra Nevada, a California Department of Fish and Game
reintroduction program increased the bighorn population to 310 from
250 and re-established three herds, including one that ranged into
Yosemite National Park. But mountain lions killed many of those
animals in the 1990s, and now only about 100 bighorns exist in the
entire Sierra range.
</P>
<P>
   Wehausen, a bighorn sheep researcher called ``the Sheep God'' by
some West Coast biologists, blamed mountain lions for the bighorn
decline in the Sierra, directly and indirectly. The cats preyed on
some sheep, but the greater effect was that terrified bighorns
abandoned winter ranges that held prime forage they needed to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   In the Sierra over the past 15 years, ``mountain lions have
caused a behavioral change in bighorns,'' Wehausen said. ``They
stopped coming down to their winter ranges, and that's where they
get nutrition and get out of the terrible environmental conditions
of high windswept areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The threat of losing Sierra bighorn populations may be
especially acute. Challenging traditional bighorn taxonomic
classifications, Wehausen has identified the Sierra animals as a
separate subspecies, one that is nearing extinction. Because of
that prospect, state wildlife officials are preparing to establish
a captive breeding program to preserve the population.
</P>
<P>
   According to the California Department of Fish and Game, lions
have also ravaged bighorns inhabiting the desert area from Palm
Springs to Mexico. Many of those sheep, called peninsular bighorns
and listed as endangered, perished from a viral disease beginning
in the 1970s, when, experts believe, they numbered around 1,200.
When the decline continued in the early 1990s, the agency put radio
collars on more than 100 of the animals to study the situation,
said Steven Torres, a state wildlife biologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that disease would still be manifest, or some type of
problem with lambs surviving,'' he said. ``To our surprise, what we
found was that the primary problem in the majority of the range was
mountain lion predation.'' In some herds, 70 percent to 90 percent
of the peninsular bighorns that died in the study were killed by
mountain lions, Torres said. Only about 280 sheep are left in eight
or nine herds spread over hundreds of square miles.
</P>
<P>
   Decades of human tinkering with mountain lion populations in
California led to trouble for bighorns, Wehausen said. Suppressing
lion numbers for many years and then outlawing all killing of the
cats caused the population to increase to record numbers, ``like
pushing down a spring and then releasing it,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In New Mexico, what had been the state's largest bighorn herd
and probably its last native population has now effectively been
driven into extinction by a combination of disease and mountain
lion predation. The desert bighorn herd in the San Andres Mountains
of southern New Mexico plummeted from about 280 in the late 1970s
to the one ewe today. The herd was first reduced to 30 to 40
animals by a virulent scabies epidemic. ``But the endgame,
interestingly, was primarily lion predation,'' said Dr. Eric
Rominger, a University of New Mexico wildlife biologist. ``In the
last 18 months, that herd went from 25 animals to just one. The
vast majority of that was lion kill,'' Rominger said. Other New
Mexico herds also have been ravaged by mountain lions, he added.
</P>
<P>
   What biologists are seeing in California and New Mexico runs
counter to what had been mainstream theory among wildlife
biologists: that predators could not significantly reduce a
population of hoofed mammals. ``We were taught wrong,'' Wehausen
said. ``All the evidence is pointing more and more in that
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the wild sheep have been durable enough to survive in
North America for tens of thousands of years, the animals'
respiratory systems leave them especially vulnerable to disease.
Epidemics of Pasturella pneumonia, often contracted through
exposure to domestic sheep grazing nearby, have killed many
bighorns, a problem exacerbated by the low reproduction rate of
bighorn ewes, only one offspring a year, and in some years, none.
Federal agencies now try to keep domestic sheep from grazing near
bighorn turf.
</P>
<P>
   But some herds may face a more insidious threat. Biologists are
concerned that even when diminished bighorn populations like the
Sierra sheep survive, their genetic diversity may be so reduced
that they will produce fewer, less healthy offspring or they will
be left even more vulnerable to random events like disease
outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   In the northern Rockies, biologists are concerned that
populations of the Rocky Mountain bighorn subspecies may be losing
genetic diversity because of their isolation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some populations of bighorns were stranded, they're remnant
populations isolated from larger blocks by habitat alteration:
agriculture, roads and fire suppression,'' said Dr. Jack Hogg,
research biologist for the nonprofit Craighead Wildlife-Wildlands
Institute in Missoula, Mont.
</P>
<P>
   And that, in turn, means more problems for some herds. ``If a
significant amount of genetic variation is being lost in the
population as a whole,'' DHogg said, ``it is almost certainly
affecting the immune system in some fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   But biologists searching for hopeful signs can look to a few
places in the West where bighorns are thriving. In Arizona, which
began reintroducing bighorns decades ago, the number of bighorns
has increased from about 1,500 to 6,500.

TINY NEW CHIP COULD PIT PROTECTION OF PROPERTY AGAINST RIGHT OF
PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ROB FIXMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Rowley seems uncomfortable in the role of braggart. A
sheepish look comes over his face when he tells you, ``We're going
to change the way people live.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rowley's assertion is not to be taken lightly. For one
thing, he said those words once before, in the early 1980s, when
the innovation he was introducing was a concept he called voice
mail. For better or worse, he did change the way we live.
</P>
<P>
   The product that inspires his boast today is a humble-looking
chip, about the size of a postage stamp and no thicker than a
nickel. When attached to a computer, it reads fingerprints with a
precision that meets the Federal Bureau of Investigation's
standards for personal identification.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning early next year, consumers will see the fingerprint
chip introduced in notebook computers, then in desktop devices.
Every major manufacturer of computer hardware in the United States
is believed to be in some stage of testing or developing products
using the chip.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, it is all but certain to be embedded in door and car
locks, bank cards, cellular telephones, driver's licenses and the
sundry other mundane objects that identify us as consumers and
citizens and give us access to places and money.
</P>
<P>
   Rowley is the chief executive of Veridicom, a tiny start-up
company in Santa Clara, Calif. He is backed by venture capital
from, among others, the Intel Corp., which recognizes the chip's
potential to open vast markets in consumer electronics, and Lucent
Technologies, which owns the patents accrued by Bell Laboratories,
where the chip was invented in the early and mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Although the product, known as OpenTouch, is cutting-edge
technology, it is low-tech by silicon standards, making it
inexpensive to manufacture in large numbers. The Korean and
Taiwanese companies under contract to produce it see Veridicom's
chip as a way to milk a few more years from old fabrication plants
that have already been fully depreciated and might otherwise be
closed as obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   All of which means that the fingerprint chip, is going to be
very inexpensive _ probably less than $10 per chip within 18 months
of its introduction, and eventually even less, industry experts
said. A low price means that it is almost certain to become far
more widely used than voice mail, whether as OpenTouch, which
Veridicom will introduce in November at the Comdex trade show, or
as another company's competing product.
</P>
<P>
   Far less certain is the social and political impact of the
fingerprint chip. It certainly can greatly enhance personal
security. But depending on how it is used, it could have a profound
impact on privacy, for better or worse.
</P>
<P>
   The paranoid will no doubt see in this chip a conspiracy by the
government or another Orwellian nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   The real threat, though, is not from Big Brother but from a
legion of what a colleague refers to as ``little brothers,''
business interests ranging from magazine publishers, to banks to
indemnity companies that want to track our every move, profile our
every passion, anticipate our every need either to persuade us to
part with our money or to assess us as risks for credit or
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Credible identification cuts two ways when it comes to security
and privacy. The same fingerprint reader that gives us secure
access to our home or car can be used to trace our movements
through office buildings, stores, schools and airports. That can be
good or bad depending on the circumstances and what we are up to.
</P>
<P>
   I may not want anyone to know that I am in Room 1705 of the Acme
Professional Building visiting my lawyer or psychiatrist or heart
specialist or interviewing for a job _ unless the person tracking
me is a fire marshal clearing a burning building.
</P>
<P>
   But if I lose my notebook computer on a flight to Seattle, I
want to know that no one will be able to rifle through my files,
because the manufacturer has frozen the code that reads the
fingerprint chip so deeply in my computer's electronics that no
amount of tampering will allow another person to boot it or to
unscramble the data on my hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, without safeguards, the same
fingerprint-identified passport that will be useless to a thief
will allow governments around the world to track my every move.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most ambiguous line between privacy threats and
security will be the use of Veridicom's technology on the Internet.
In many ways, it will be the ultimate ``cookie,'' those files that
Web sites place on our hard drives to identify us, or at least our
computers, when we point our browsers in their direction.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, this is beneficial. If the fingerprint reader on
my computer serves as a certificate of identification when I buy
something on line, the seller does not know my credit card number
or whether I am paying with credit or cash.
</P>
<P>
   The seller may not even know my identity. Veridicom's chip
assures the seller that I am who I claim to be without revealing
who I am.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, when used as an encryption key, the chip will
guarantee that no one can unscramble and read my e-mail or other
documents.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a darker side.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are already using cookies to create personal profiles
of Internet users by aggregating every piece of information we
surrender on Web sites. The very kinds of sites we visit reveal a
great deal about us to those who want our money, and when we buy
products or enter contests or register to use a site, we reveal not
only who we are but a great deal about how we live.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a study released this summer by the Federal
Trade Commission revealed that most businesses on the Web did not
tell visitors how the information they surrendered would be used.
</P>
<P>
   In a few cases, the study found that companies sold information
that they had promised users would be kept confidential. The
Clinton administration insists that for now, the infant
electronic-commerce industries be allowed to police themselves in
matters of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   That is frightening enough when our cookies give up information
dropped on our treks through cyberspace. When everything we do on
line can be tied to our credit and bank cards, driver's licenses
and passports, the extra security we have gained might well be
outweighed by the privacy we have lost.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Tom Rowley spends most of his time these days
trumpeting the potential benefits of his chip, but he does not deny
its potential for mischief. After all, he admits, at times even
voicemail ``is a real pain.''
</P>
<P>
   The social stakes this time around are a lot higher.

 &HT;    Everybody loves a bargain, and there are plenty of car deals
right now
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Between a number of great cars being discontinued, primarily
because of competition from sport-utilities; low interest rates;
and outstanding rebate programs, the time is right.
</P>
<P>
   Rebates are the biggest story. Thanks to the General Motors
strike this summer, GM dealers are fighting to regain their share
of the market place. One GM executive called their lucrative rebate
program, ``Creative marketing.'' It could also be called necessary
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Americans generally are buying fewer new cars. There are a
couple of reasons for this: Cars are being built better, so they
last longer, and there are a lot of good pre-owned vehicles
available. But right now, new-car shoppers can find some good deals
if they take their time and do their homework.
</P>
<P>
   Many GM luxury and high-end vehicles have rebates of $2,000 or
better. But the news gets better, for the first time, the terms are
ones that most consumers can live with. In the past, rebates were
often hooked to a 24-month purchase with a high interest rate. Not
this time.
</P>
<P>
   Shop around. Some dealers will go as long as five years on the
financing on these rebated models at attractive interest rates.
This frequently means that on cars you never thought you could
afford, the rebate will qualify as the down payment.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is stable prices. Carmakers are not automatically
raising the price of their product every year. For example, Ford is
reducing the base price of the '99 Taurus models, compared with
comparably equipped '98 models.
</P>
<P>
   What has been a dark cloud in the automotive industry has a
silver lining for the consumer: A number of great cars have been
discontinued. Dealers don't want to keep new copies of last year's
discontinued models on their lots.
</P>
<P>
   The Lincoln Mark VIII is a truly wonderful car. Lincoln got this
model right. Unfortunately, they also go the Lincoln Navigator
right, and sales of the two-door coupe were not adequate to justify
continuing production. If you can resist buying a sport-utility,
your Lincoln dealer may have some outstanding values on a
1998-model car that comes standard with all the bells and whistles.
</P>
<P>
   Another victim of the sport-utility/truck craze is one of the
finest sports cars: the Toyota Supra Twin Turbo. I have found a
Supra a kick to drive and enjoyed it not only for its brute power,
but its superb handling and outstanding brakes.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent automotive magazine, Mario Andretti agreed about the
Supra's wonderful manners in a test of high-performance vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Another sad casualty is the Buick Riviera. Like the Mark VIII,
the Riviera brand has been a part of the American automotive
culture for generations. It is sad to see both of them go. The poor
Riviera can't even blame its demise on an sport-utility _ Buick
doesn't have one, at least not yet.

 &HT;    Daewoo enters U.S. market with impressive tactic
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps the most difficult business move is to gain a stronghold
in the American automotive market. History has shown it is often
difficult for even the Big Three American automakers to maintain
what they perceive as their fair share of that market.
</P>
<P>
   You can imagine the challenge that lies before a foreign
manufacturer just to get a foot in the door, much less keep that
door open.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see why a manufacturer would fight such seemingly
insurmountable odds. The American auto market is the world's most
lucrative. If you make it here, then you have ``made it.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent entrant into the American auto wars is Daewoo Motor
America. Daewoo is not exactly a household name. Or is it? You may
have seen it in the appliance department of your local discount
store. The parent company makes a multitude of products, including
microwave ovens. But to see the name Daewoo on a vehicle is most
likely a new experience.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent test drive, I noticed the woman behind me
creeping closer to read the name on the back of my Leganza as we
waited for the stoplight. That was a positive sign for the Daewoo
brand. Its product caught at least one eye of the automotive
public, and she wanted to know more.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo, a South Korean corporation, has taken a different
approach to attract the American market than did its national
rivals, Hyundai and Kia.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai entered with one entry-level model, the Excell, hoping
to capitalize on America's need for basic transportation. Kia
entered one model at a time with its natty little Sportage.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo's tactic is to enter the U.S. market with a trio of
vehicles: an entry-level model, the Lanos, with pricing beginning
at $9,000; a midpriced model, the Nubira, starting at $12,000; and
the flagship Leganza, priced from $15,000 to $20,000. All three
models share upscale amenities and interiors for their market
segment. They also have horsepower and torque ratings that make
them competitive: 105 horsepower for the Lanos, 128 hp for the
Nubira and 131 hp for the Leganza.
</P>
<P>
   All three models also share a corporate identity in their common
featured grille. On the Lanos, the grille matches the paint, while
on the Leganza, it is more pronounced and chrome-plated. But there
is no mistaking they are of the same heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Only time and miles will determine if the Daewoo brand has what
it takes to survive in our marketplace, but from outward
appearances, it seems to have arrived with its best face forward.

 &HT;    Audi wagon offers sporty ride
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   So you need the passenger/cargo potential of a large
sport-utility vehicle or station wagon, but want the driving
characteristics of a luxury sedan? Well, welcome once again to the
realm of what manufacturers _ primarily German ones _ call ``sport
wagons.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, it's the Audi Avant being introduced to the North
American market. It's a true five-passenger front-wheel-drive with
enough near-luxury sport sedan traits to make most drivers forget
it's basically a station wagon. The new addition to Audi's, ahem,
entry-level A4 line, the Avant comes with a base price of $30,965,
while the sedan versions start at $24,290.
</P>
<P>
   The ``cactus green mica clearcoat'' test car totaled $34,075 and
came with some features not normally associated with wagons:
sunroof, a shift-it-yourself Tiptronic transmission from Porsche, a
30-valve V-6 engine rated at 190 horsepower with 207 pounds-feet of
torque and a sporty suspension that won't toss around its body or
passengers when the driving gets frisky.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't hurt the driveability of the A4 Avant, though. Rough
pavement may disturb its equanimity, but most street and highway
travel is not going to remind drivers the Avant is a four-door
wagon with 31 cubic feet of cargo space (63.7 with the split rear
seat fully folded).
</P>
<P>
   The V-6 clearly doesn't suffer from comparison to the pricier A6
wagon with its 200-horsepower engine ($33,750) _ and the five-speed
automatic transmission is the reason why. Left to itself, the
transmission adapts to each driver's style or mood; slipped into
the semi-manual or Tiptronic mode, the A4 Avant gives the driver
freedom of choice, but will not let itself be strung out with too
many engine rpm in a lower gear.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, the Tiptronic shifter _ unlike some semi-manuals
that shift side-to-side _ is tipped forward for upshifts and pulled
back for downshifts. It does make a difference because the motion
is more akin to a true floor-mounted manual, which is not offered.
</P>
<P>
   The interior fairly typifies the near-luxury tag given the A4
Avant. Good seats that encourage an erect driving position also
provide the driver with eight-way power adjustments. The rear can
take three occupants without smushing them together, and legroom is
adequate.
</P>
<P>
   The instrumentation, which is ridiculously easy to read at
night, and layout offer no surprises. Comfort and convenience seem
up to Teutonic standards.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the A4 Avant gets good marks for approaching the
utility of a traditional station wagon, but deserves even better
marks for its sport sedan qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 1998 Audi A4 Avant front-drive, five-passenger
sport wagon
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $34,075 (base: $30,965)
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual front air bags, front side air bags, power
disc brakes, side-impact beams, five three-point seat belts with
adjustable headrests, Automatic Slip Control traction system, front
and rear fog lamps
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 2.8-liter V-6 engine with 30 valves (190
horsepower), five-speed automatic transmission with Tiptronic
semi-manual mode
</P>
<P>
   Options on test vehicle: 150-watt Bose stereo with CD changer
and eight speakers, $1,200; glass sunroof and remote locking,
$1,190; heated front seats, washer nozzles and driver's door lock,
$470; trip computer, $250
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 18 mpg regular unleaded city; 29 mpg highway
(premium recommended)

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLE, Norway _ Something is moving inside a Viking burial mound
said to be the ninth-century tomb of King Halvdan the Black. But
some archaeologists are loath to enter, warning that whatever is in
there could dissolve the spell of enchantment that helped make
Norway a nation.
</P>
<P>
   A recent subsidence in the large, man-made hillock 30 miles
northwest of Oslo has set off a debate over the urgency and
propriety of excavating the site to save what could be the richest
archaeological cache in Scandinavia. Ground-penetrating radar and
core samples indicate the likely presence of a 75-foot-long,
rapierlike wooden Viking ship and other treasures that could tell
Norwegians much about the period when they terrorized the
hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Viking ships have been exhumed before, but a local historian
calls this one ``Norway's Noah's Ark'' because of Halvdan the
Black's pivotal role in the ancient sagas and skaldic poems that
form the basis of Norwegian historical identity.
</P>
<P>
   Schoolchildren learn that Halvdan was a powerful regional king
who drowned in 860 when his horse-drawn sleigh plunged through the
ice of Rands Fjord. They learn that he, or at least his head, was
buried in a mound in Ringerike (modern-day Hole), and that his
charismatic son, Harald Fairhair, became the first ruler of a
unified Norway before the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Inger Liv Goytil Lund, Buskerud County's official archaeologist,
urges an immediate excavation, saying a four-inch sinkage that she
detected over five years could reflect the decomposition of large
artifacts in the mound. Local political leaders are bursting with
curiosity and eager to attract tourists with a new Viking ship
museum. By contrast, most archaeologists senior enough to conduct
such a dig have shown restraint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to save it for the future,'' said Arne Emil
Christensen, 63, Norway's top authority on Viking ships. ``We are
not the last generation of archaeologists. The people succeeding us
should also have some fun.''
</P>
<P>
   He downplayed the tomb's apparent slow-motion collapse and said
Norway lacked the money, expertise and facilities to excavate in a
style worthy of the site. But there is more to the issue. In
interviews, several scholars said they feared that a sensational
dig could traumatize some Norwegians by ``puncturing'' their
founding lore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mythological starting point of a nation is dangerous
ground to enter,'' said Christian Keller, an archaeologist at the
Center for Viking and Nordic Medieval Studies at the University of
Oslo, who opposes excavation. ``This is not just science. It is
national psychology.''
</P>
<P>
   Halvdan the Black, named for his dark hair, is best known
through ``Heimskringla,'' the colorful and bloody sagas of the
Norse kings as recorded by the wandering Icelandic sage Snorri
Sturluson in the early 1200s. Today Snorri's work stands beside the
Bible on many Norwegian bookshelves and is the primary historical
record of Norway through the year 1177.
</P>
<P>
   Snorri's account of 26 Norse rulers predating Halvdan is clearly
fanciful, starting as it does with the god Odin. But the narrative
turns abruptly concrete with ``The Saga of Halvdan the Black'' and
grows in detail and believability with his son Harald's conquests
and the treachery of his grandson, Erik Blood-Axe. Snorri describes
the evolution of Norway as a European state and sheds light on
Viking raids and excursions as far afield as ``Vinland,'' which
many historians believe is the coast of Newfoundland.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the 1990s have literary historians somewhat
sacrilegiously begun to speculate that Halvdan the Black and other
figures of his age were invented or embellished by medieval court
poets before Snorri's time. The motive: to strengthen the rule of
Harald and his descendants by extending the royal lineage backward.
</P>
<P>
   Excavating the mound that bears Halvdan's name could prove he
existed and that his contemporaries revered him. But Norwegians
must also brace themselves for the possibility that archaeologists
will find instead the remains of a woman, or a runic inscription
wishing happy journey to an Otto or Torleif. One expert predicts
that the mound's contents will predate Halvdan by hundreds of
years, while others worry that the site will be an archaeological
dud, plundered centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen feet high and 177 feet in diameter, the mound remains
the symbol of power that its builders intended. With a crown of
birch trees it looms over the barley and rapeseed fields of Stein
farm, whose owner, Jan Fredrik Hornemann, is a recent convert to
the pro-excavation forces. ``At first, I felt protective of the old
stories,'' Hornemann said. ``But now, with all the talk, I'm
curious.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's core samples turned up bits of leather, feathers and
down in addition to crafted wood. If the shiplike form revealed by
radar is a vessel, it could be in good condition because the mound
is made of bluish clay that keeps moisture in and oxygen out. The
effect of several badger tunnels, however, is of some concern.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Norwegian archaeologists have not excavated a ship since 1904,
but they often cooperate with Danish colleagues who have superior
expertise in wood conservation technology and in dendrochronology,
the science of analyzing tree growth rings to date wooden objects.
Since 1962, Danish experts have recovered more than a dozen sunken
medieval vessels, though none with the historical significance of
Halvdan's presumed burial ship.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists excavating a ship must work feverishly to
transfer newly exposed wood to a special solution in a tank before
it can dry and shrink. All items have to bathe in warm, waxy
polyethylene glycol for two years, then, ideally, undergo freeze
drying for up to six months in a vacuum chamber. Reassembling the
vessel for display can take two more years.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually an expert must saw out cross sections of the
preserved wood to determine its age. Given a chance, a
dendrochronologist could knock Halvdan the Black off his timeline
or even relegate him to the fiction shelf.
</P>
<P>
   Niels Bonde, head of dendrochronology at Denmark's National
Museum, can tell the exact year an ancient tree was felled. If he
gets a sample with the outermost ring intact, he can even specify
the season. He does so by comparing the ring pattern of his sample
with master ring chronologies dating back four millenniums and
covering all of northern Europe. ``It is similar to having a key
and looking for the right hole,'' Bonde said.
</P>
<P>
   Computer search programs and steadily expanding databases are
helping scientists to pin down the dates with even greater
certainty. Bonde once used dendrochronology to dash Norwegian
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian archaeologists had believed that the remains of a
woman from a spectacular Viking ship grave excavated in 1904 could
be those of Queen Aase, supposedly Halvdan the Black's mother. But
in 1992, when Bonde examined a tree trunk from the woman's midship
burial chamber, he easily pegged her death to the summer of 834 _
about 15 years too early for Queen Aase.
</P>
<P>
   Because Snorri wrote his history long after Halvdan's purported
lifetime, the burial date of 860 may not be exact. But if Halvdan
was Harald Fairhair's father and the mound in Hole was built upon
his death, wood samples from the burial chamber must come from
within a generation of certain well-documented battles that Harald
fought.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the region surrounding Hole is filled with Halvdan
devotees like Gudmund Hvattum, a school psychologist turned Viking
skald. His latest Halvdan the Black musical will soon be performed
atop Halvdan's Mound by the local theater troupe and a choir of 60
Valkyries, maidens who conduct the souls of heroes killed in battle
to Valhalla.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is fascinating to have such a mound in our midst,'' Hvattum
said. ``It fires the imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lund, the Buskerud County archaeologist, said her colleagues
have been too timid in response to the subsidence of Halvdan's
Mound. But even Ms. Lund had to pause and ask, ``What if we ruin
the myth? Will we ever be forgiven by our descendants?''

RAYON 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By C. CLAIBORNE RAY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Is rayon a natural fiber?
</P>
<P>
   A. Sort of. ``We call it a regenerated or manufactured fiber,''
said Dr. Kay Obendorf, professor of textiles and apparel at Cornell
University in Ithaca, N.Y. That is because the fiber is
manufactured, but the the long, complex, chain-shaped molecule from
which it is made, called the polymer, is not manufactured.
</P>
<P>
   In polyester and nylon, she said, this molecule is synthesized.
In rayon, however, it is a natural molecule called cellulose, a
substance that plants have in their woody cells. When rayon was
first made, the cellulose sources were wood pulp and short cotton
fibers that were not long enough to go into making yarn.
</P>
<P>
   There are several different processes for making rayon, Dr.
Obendorf said. All rely on modifying the cellulose to make it
soluble in a chemical called the spinning solution. This solution
is pushed out, or extruded, through a device with a specially
engineered opening, called a spinneret, and the resulting fiber is
rayon.
</P>
<P>
   Some rayon can be laundered and some should be dry-cleaned. The
difference is in the arrangement of the polymers within the fiber
and the varying wet strengths that result.
</P>
<P>
   ``We launder cellulose all the time,'' Dr. Obendorf said.
``Cotton is cellulose, and cotton is actually stronger wet than
dry. The alignment of polymers in the wet stage is stronger and
shares the load better.''
</P>
<P>
   In some forms of rayon, like viscose rayon, the components of
the fibers move farther apart when they are wet and lose strength,
Dr. Obendorf said. In newer kinds, like Tencel and Vantrel, there
is a different arrangement of polymers within the fibers, allowing
them to be washed.  &QL;

 NEW YORK: in 30 countries.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unlike world leaders, weavers understood each other _ by
watching. Cloth was like an early map.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Larsen's great love is home, which is largely Longhouse
Reserve, completed in 1992 in collaboration _ their 30th _ with
Charles Forberg, an architect. It is an imposing house on stilts,
suggested by the Shinto shrine in Ise, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   His collections of ancient and contemporary crafts, including
textiles, ceramics and furniture, have followed him there, and
continue to grow, as does the garden with its own art collection.
There is also an arboretum _ Larsen collects trees. Last year, he
sold Larsen Inc. to Cowtan and Tout, a fabric and wallcoverings
company, but he remains a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I finished the house, I wanted to put an epitaph on it,''
he said. ```To The Manor Died' _ I wasn't to the manor born.''
Larsen, leading a brisk tour through the garden _ the briskest
takes about 45 minutes _ was debating the offer of a gift of
Italian cypresses made to the foundation that morning. Past an
allee of cedar trunks painted red, his parents' ashes under a fir
leaf birch, and a Buckminster Fuller open-air dome, loaned this
summer by his daughter, Larsen moved his small group toward
Longhouse, a 180-foot-long building hovering above manmade dunes.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Larsen did a quick walk-about in the living room,
beneath its 65-foot skylight. Much of the foundation's loan
collections are on display here. Then he strode the length of the
house, past the center A-frame stairwell, with its two-story Dale
Chihuly lizard-green glass pendant _ it was Larsen who urged
Chihuly, then a weaving student, to take glassblowing lessons after
seeing a project of strips of woven glass _ to the smaller, more
intimate sitting room in Larsen's private quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The peaked room is tented, in the style of Napoleon, in a Larsen
fabric, ``Canterbury,'' a jacquard weave of Egyptian linen designed
in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hoped this tented ceiling and fabric walls would become a
national trend,'' Larsen said. ``It didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign-style room is neatly, snugly enfolded in Larsen's
own personal collections.
</P>
<P>
   There is a Swedish ceramic stove, with two ebony Philippine
armchairs before it. To the side is an 18th-century painted-cloth
Iranian camp table that displays a box turtle shell found on the
property and a 19th-century American patent ladder, which is used
as bookshelves. There are five uncharacteristically delicate Edward
Wormley tables and a good representation of pieces by Wharton
Esherick, the dean of American craft furniture makers, including a
side chair with a puzzle of miners' hammer handles fitted together
to form the base. A pretty varnished rolling table was his
mother's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody made it in the Navy yard in Seattle, for cribbage,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the interior walls at Longhouse are sliding panels,
stretched with fabric, a device based on a Japanese architectural
element, the paper-panel fusama, which creates rooms and conceals
storage. An opaque, woven leather cloth in the bedroom conceals
clothes and bath towels; a sheer linen threaded with hand-clipped
Thai silk floats to showcase, in silhouette, shelves of ceramic
collections. Other panels, rolled aside, reveal a short history of
ceramics _ Yi-xing wine pots, Han Dynasty heads, a Dansk design of
Larsen's and a vase by Dame Lucy Rie, the British studio potter,
and a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Larsen picked the vase from the shelf, turning the milky ceramic
in his hands as though it were a face he was trying to revolve into
view.
</P>
<P>
   ``She became like an abbess, always in white,'' he said.
``Frail, almost like blowing dandelion down.''
</P>
<P>
   Larsen keeps his influences, experiences and memories on a shelf
_ behind him, for others to admire. Weavers live for surprise _
that burst of firsts when paths intersect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I maintained the fantasy, until I was about 34, that I wasn't
really working,'' Larsen said. ``It occurred to me that I spent
more hours doing what I did than anyone I knew. Other people would
call it work,'' he said, composing a salad for lunch _ beets for
color, walnuts for texture, string beans for structure and lettuce
greens for form. ``But I'm just playing very hard.''

FROM REDHEADED STRANGER TO NATIONAL TREASURE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Willie Nelson is, of course, on the road again at 65: somewhere
between Abbott and Texas Lil's in Justin, Texas, somewhere between
shadowy ``Teatro'' and glittering Kennedy Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are going OK,'' he reports, an understatement for
someone soon to be officially designated as a national treasure.
Nelson is in a buoyant mood. He laughs when prodded about a recent
article in Entertainment Weekly that said he and the reporter
shared marijuana during the interview. Nelson is also quoted as
saying he first tried pot 45 years ago in Fort Worth, where ``it
wasn't a big deal back in the early days.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his hippie past, Nelson finds it only slightly ironic
that he is scheduled to join the likes of Shirley Temple Black as
an official honoree in Washington at the Kennedy Center Awards on
Dec. 6. It wasn't very long ago that the IRS was seizing his
property over unpaid taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, there's other people in that room who'll be
taking more heat than I will,'' he said, laughing over the
president's current troubles. He is an FOB, though, and Nelson was
quick to defend Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't wish anybody the kind of things that've happened to
this man,'' Nelson said. ``I'm thinking of writing a song called
`Kenny Starr, You've Gone Too Far' and getting Bill to play
saxophone on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's recording career is being rejuvenated by his daring new
release, ``Teatro,'' for him an edgier effort by West Coast
producer Daniel Lanois. Willie went from complete self-production
on his last release (the ultra-acoustic ``Spirit'') into the
unknown with Lanois, a man who specializes in redirecting mature
stars like Willie, Emmylou Harris and Bob Dylan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like I've found a nice spot,'' Willie says. In fact,
he extends an offer to this reporter to come on by Texas Lil's on
Wednesday to hang out. We'll have a beer, he promises. A ``beer.''

 &HT;    A guide to staying healthy at every age
 &HT;    (EDS: A graphic showing components of a physical exam by age is
available.)
 &HT;    By Norma Martin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Shane Beck remembers his last physical. It
happened when summer vacation was melting into the new school year.
It went something like this:
</P>
<P>
   Weight taken. Check.
</P>
<P>
   Height measured. Check.
</P>
<P>
   Urinate in cup. Check.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to heart. Check.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to lungs. Check.
</P>
<P>
   Look in ears. Check.
</P>
<P>
   Look in eyes. Check.
</P>
<P>
   Gauge reflexes. Check.
</P>
<P>
   Examine for hernia. Check.
</P>
<P>
   Now, let's play football!
</P>
<P>
   Beck, you see, is an 18-year-old senior at LBJ High School and
quarterback on the school's football team. His sixth annual
physical was fine for a healthy teen-ager, local doctors say.
</P>
<P>
   The important word here is teen-ager. If your last physical was
at the Shane Beck level and you're old enough to rent a car (25),
it's time to enter the adult realm of the physical exam. It's where
doctors and nurse practitioners use diagnostic expertise, medical
research and a chemistry lab full of early-detection methods in
their efforts to provide preventive care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, we don't have many people in their 20s, especially
not men. They usually stop coming in after their sports
physicals,'' said Dr. Michael Romain, who specializes in internal
medicine at North Austin Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Romain and other doctors at the North Austin Medical Center
created a ``Preventive Care for Adults'' pamphlet that outlines
health-check directives through adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   For twentysomethings, the annual physical centers around
lifestyle matters: safe sex, alcohol, smoking and drugs. And of
course, they want you to provide a family medical history as
detailed as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing for men in their 20s is the
testicular exam,'' said Romain. Like women who check for lumps in
their breasts, men should examine their testicles monthly.
</P>
<P>
   In their 30s, women usually have established a pattern of going
to gynecologists for pelvic exams and PAP smears, especially if
they're sexually active or are bearing children, say doctors. But
this is the decade when both sexes absolutely need an annual
physical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the habits you cultivate at this age that will determine
what happens to you when you reach your 60s, 70s and 80s,'' said
Dr. Ted Edwards, an internist who specializes in preventive and
sports medicine. ``This is where the internist can be of the most
value by taking the leadership role in helping patients develop a
healthy lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   It's in the 30s that the groundwork for chronic conditions, such
diabetes, hypertension and heart disease, is often laid. This also
is period when lifestyle stresses make appearances, from career
climbing to child caring.
</P>
<P>
   And what the life is doing, the body is absorbing. This is when
the annual exam goes more high-tech, with the first comprehensive
chemistry lab test screenings around age 35. If it has been at
least 10 years since the last tetanus shot, now is the time to get
one.
</P>
<P>
   The 40s are the years for the cutting-edge diagnostic tests to
kick in. Women are having mammograms. Men are undergoing prostate
tests. Everybody is having their cholesterol checked, vision
examined, blood worked up and a rectal exam for colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important for people to get their physicals annually
as they move into middle age,'' said Ivone Bickham, a family nurse
practitioner. Bickham, like most nurse practitioners, handles adult
physicals along with other specialized health care professionals.
</P>
<P>
   When patients hit their 50s, ``the situation changes'' in terms
of the physical, doctors say. If preventive measures were adhered
to in the previous 20 years or so, the middle years should have
less risk for serious illness. Yet there are new tests to add to
the annual exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk of colon cancer picks up,'' said Edwards. With that
in mind, patients need colorectal screenings. Also, mammograms go
annual and men should get their PSA (prostate specific antigen)
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Besides mammograms, Romain said, women usually are experiencing
the onset of menopause. As a result, the annual exam is a good time
to start discussing estrogen replacement therapy, osteoporosis and
vitamin supplements.
</P>
<P>
   As with any physical exam, medical professionals say, it's
always best for patients to bring in all medications, including
over-the-counter and prescribed, as well as any vitamins they are
taking. ``You want to make sure they are taking the correct things
in the right amounts,'' said Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   By late middle-age and beyond _ age 60 to elderly _ most of the
screenings and tests have been introduced, but there are a couple
of new measures: a flu vaccine and a one-time pneumonia vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you didn't do in the 30s and 40s will show up now,'' said
Edwards. ``If you were practicing a healthy lifestyle and eating a
diet of high fiber and moderate fat and taking supplements and
getting your exercise and doing some strength training, you're less
likely to have problems during the latter years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We now know that humans can live to (age) 120 and be in
relatively good health thanks to modern medicine, preventive
medicine,'' he said.

 UNDATED: his fee.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ms. Nicholson began her shopping on line two years ago by
calling up a search engine and typing in ``real estate.'' While
that provided her with an overwhelming number of sites, few sites
at that time offered anything in Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   The process was also time-consuming because it required
following a number of links. While Ms. Nicholson had the most
success with Realtor.com, numerous sites have been added since
then. And there are now many ways to search for a home, tailoring
the listings according to the desired city, price range, house size
and special features, like fireplaces and swimming pools.
</P>
<P>
   But sorting through those options can be mind-boggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a pile of clutter,'' said Barbara Corcoran, founder
of the Corcoran Group real estate company in Manhattan. Speaking of
the company's Web site, she said: ``We build bridges everywhere we
can. The more bridges we have, the more traffic we have.''
</P>
<P>
   To attract and retain visitors to the Web site, Ms. Corcoran
relies on what she calls ``bells and whistles'' _ 360-degree
virtual-reality walk-throughs, for example, a feature that is
generally available only for a handful of more expensive
properties.
</P>
<P>
   One useful feature of Corcoran's site is its inclusion of
addresses (but no apartment numbers) for most properties it
advertises on the Net. But many real estate agents disapprove of
that practice, saying it could jeopardize homeowners' security, and
do not list addresses on Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Corcoran has seen her company's Internet-related sales _
sales that followed an initial contact with the company through
e-mail _ grow to $60 million in 1997 from $4.9 million in 1995,
when the site began.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also found that its Web site helps many
customers find what they want more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of Corcoran buyers found that the clients who had used
the Internet had spent only a quarter as much time house-hunting as
had other clients.
</P>
<P>
   The clients who did not use the Web spent about four months with
a realtor, on average, and looked at about 21 homes, while the
``Webheads,'' as the survey called them, spent an average of only
one month with a real estate agent and saw only 5 properties before
buying.
</P>
<P>
   The Web can make brokers and sales agents more visible. At
Corcoran, Sarah Bond, a vice president at the company, made a
valuable contact with a British client who saw a profile of her on
the Internet and selected her because she rode a vintage bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Frankovic, an associate broker with Windermere Real Estate
in Spokane, Wash., has taken on the persona of Garlic Bob on his
Web site. Frankovic, who was forced to eat garlic sandwiches as a
child in the hopes of keeping polio at bay, now grows acres of the
stuff. His Web site includes a photograph of him on an old red
tractor, and he will happily provide information on garlic as well
as on real-estate listings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a goofy picture,'' he said. ``But even if you don't like
me, you'll remember me.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankovic's site was among a dozen that attracted Larry Barnes
when he was looking for a new realtor to sell a house he had left
350 miles behind in Spokane after moving to Whidbey Island, outside
Seattle. Faced with the option of driving back to Seattle or
calling long distance to find a realtor, Barnes turned to the
Internet, narrowing his search by state and city and then looking
at his options.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had I not been on Realtor.com, he would not have found me,''
Frankovic said, noting that his commission on the house had been
well worth the less than $1,000 he spends a year to operate his
Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Realtor.com, which has been in operation for more than two
years, has the backing of the National Association of Realtors.
Many of its listings come directly from multiple listing services.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Keller, vice president for marketing at Real Select,
which operates the Realtor.com site, says it has a vast database
and takes a direct approach. ``What we're really about is
convenience,'' he said. ``You go to the grocery store more often
than not to pick up milk. That's what we're about, milk.''
</P>
<P>
   While a variety of companies have top-notch sites, most
observers see a battle shaping up between Realtor.com and Home
Advisor, which at this point is lagging behind in listings.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Morris, the lead product manager for Home Advisor, the
Microsoft site, played down the fact that the site is behind
Realtor.com in listings, pointing out that Home Advisor opened with
a preview only in July. He said Microsoft was providing a
comprehensive guide to home buying that helped consumers figure out
how much they could afford and offered neighborhood information and
loan and closing assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said Microsoft was in the business to generate money from
loan origination fees paid by mortgage brokerage companies
associated with the service. ``It allows us to provide a great
service to consumers for free,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With such competition, the bottom line seems to be that realtors
can jump in or face being left out. ``Things are changing,''
Frankovic said. ``The Internet is the way people like to do
business. It's the way I like to do business. You don't have to go
knocking on doors.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The remnants of Hurricane Georges will continue to pour
excessive rain on eastern Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida
panhandle. Another foot of rain is possible in a few locations just
east of the dying storm center. The winds will be greatly
diminished with only a few squalls having gale-force gusts. Rain
clouds will spread into the Tennessee Valley and across much of the
interior Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Skies will clear just west of the Mississippi River with mainly
sunny and hot conditions expected in the southern and central
Plains. It will become warmer in the Midwest as winds begin to blow
from the south again. A few thundershowers will develop from the
southern Great Lakes to the central Plains.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure near the Maryland Coast will sponsor sunshine and
seasonable conditions from northern Virginia to eastern Maine.
Clouds will increase in western New England ahead of a cool front.
Meanwhile, variable clouds and a few showers are expected in the
upper Lakes as a cooler air mass stalls from Michigan to the
eastern Dakotas.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies will be bright and
milder as high pressure builds into British Columbia in the wake of
a cool front. Coastal clouds will linger in Oregon. A large, but
weak disturbance over Nevada and southern California will promote
mainly afternoon thundershowers from the coastal range and the
southern Sierra to central Utah and western Colorado. The deserts
of the Southwest will be sunny and seasonably hot.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Seeing Stars
</P>
<P>
   Weather observers saw stars early Monday as the relatively clear
eye of Hurricane Georges came ashore in southern Mississippi. The
eye is a unique environment that few people experience. It is a
small oasis of tranquillity surrounded by a sea of storminess whose
scale and ferocity is unmatched on this planet. The eye's sultry
warmth provides a suitable backdrop for viewing the thousands of
tropical birds that sometimes become trapped during the hurricane's
development. To experience the eye, one must be near the coast
because the fleeting eye collapses once the storm moves inland.

AMERICANS LEARN THAT TAKING GUNS INTO MEXICO IS A RISKY VENTURE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Lubbock rancher Johnny Bob Carruth took a wrong turn into
Mexico earlier this year, he ran straight into a culture clash.
</P>
<P>
   Carruth, 50, was arrested for smuggling his Winchester
.22-caliber rifle into Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El
Paso.
</P>
<P>
   The simple act of carrying an old rifle in his pickup _ which he
had done for 17 years _ cost him 46 days in Mexican custody and
more than $100,000 in legal fees and other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   But Carruth is lucky. He could have spent two to eight years
behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Whether by mistake or ignorance of Mexican law, increasing
numbers of U.S. citizens are being arrested by Mexican authorities
at border crossings and hit with big fines and long prison terms _
in some cases, up to 30 years _ for illegally importing firearms or
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Embassy officials in Mexico City said as of June, 69 of the
317 Americans in Mexican jails were being held on weapons or
ammunition charges and more are being arrested every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texans have a tradition of cherishing their right to bear
arms, and Mexico is very wary about arms in the hands of civilians.
It's an area where we have an ongoing cultural clash,'' said George
Kopf, the U.S. consul in Matamoros. ``Unfortunately, the results
are many arrested people, many confiscated vehicles and much
tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, three Americans who had spent months in Mexican jails
because of weapons violations were sent back to the United States
in a routine prisoner exchange. But Kopf said Americans apparently
aren't getting the message. Three have been jailed in his district
in the past two weeks, and 125 have been arrested across Mexico so
far this year.
</P>
<P>
   And while Mexico experts say escalating violence by well-armed
drug traffickers and armed peasant uprisings in southern Mexico are
behind an increasingly hard line taken by the Mexican government,
Americans who have been arrested claim it is pure extortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not any damn guerrillas or drugs. The Mexican officials
know either the people who get caught will come up with the money
to secure their release, or their family will,'' insists Carruth.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the clash between Mexico and the United States
are differing attitudes and public policies regarding firearms in
the neighboring nations. In Texas and most other states,
law-abiding adults can purchase an unlimited number of firearms,
including weapons used by the military and police and powerful,
large-caliber handguns.
</P>
<P>
   But in Mexico, civilians must obtain expensive permits from the
military to buy sporting arms used for hunting. Handguns are almost
impossible to purchase legally, and weapons used by the military
and police are strictly prohibited in the hands of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``When folks are arrested they frequently say, ```I didn't
know,' or `My gun was legally registered in the U.S. so what's the
problem?''' said Kopf. ``I guess we have a lot more to do in terms
of public information on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Texas dove season began earlier this month, Kopf
closed down his consulate for a day and dispatched his staff to
distribute 10,000 leaflets in South Texas stores where firearms and
ammunition are sold. It was an effort to spread the word about the
legal procedure for importing sporting guns and ammunition into
Mexico, and to warn hunters against leaving a box of shells in
their vehicles if they cross the Rio Grande to shop or dine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't bring your guns into Mexico,'' is the message Mark
Leoni, the American consul in Ciudad Juarez, across the border from
El Paso, wants Americans to remember when heading south. ``Be aware
these laws are being enforced. The Mexicans are within their rights
to enforce them, and they have heavy penalties.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Americans who inadvertently crossed into Mexico
with a weapon were charged with simple possession. But in recent
years, Mexican authorities have stepped up enforcement, charging
violators with more serious smuggling charges.
</P>
<P>
   The change in policy, Leoni notes, makes a big difference.
Simple possession of a non-military firearm (less than .38-caliber)
or ammunition carries penalties from six months to three years in
jail, but allows violators to post a bond. And most Americans who
post bond in Mexico head home with no intentions of returning to
face trial. But a smuggling charge for carrying the same weapon
carries a two to eight year sentence, and bond is not allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican law is even stricter for possessing or smuggling
firearms and ammunition reserved for military use, such as pistols
larger than .38-caliber, rifles of .30-caliber or greater, shotguns
larger than 12-gauge or those with barrels shorter than 25 inches.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty for possessing such weapons is one to 12 years in
prison, depending on the type of weapon, and smuggling such weapons
into Mexico or even one round of military ammunition carries a
five- to 30-year prison sentence, plus fines up to $2,000, consular
officials warn.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say Mexican judges have no choice but to sentence
someone found guilty of arms smuggling, despite extenuating
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Even character references from Louisiana police and his priest,
and the fact the guns he was caught with belonged to someone else,
didn't help Lake Charles meatcutter Johnny Manuel avoid a prison
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 18, a Mexican judge sentenced Manuel to a five-year
prison term for smuggling two hunting rifles and a pistol owned by
his fiancee, who worked as a security guard on a riverboat casino
in Lake Charles. Manuel, 49, was helping his fiancee move from
Arizona to Louisiana last March when the couple stopped for the
night in El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Like rancher Carruth, Manuel planned to park on the U.S. side of
the border and walk across the bridge to Juarez. But he took the
wrong exit off the freeway and heavy traffic prevented him from
turning back. He ended up driving his fiancee's car _ loaded with
all her belongings _ over another bridge into Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad, very, very sad,'' said Jackie Palermo, Manuel's
sister. ``It has stripped him of everything. He feels like he's
been dropped into another world and swallowed.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the emotional toll, Manuel's conviction has also brought
financial hardship on his eight brothers and sisters, as well as a
21-year-old son, who take turns calling him at the Ciudad Juarez
prison, his sister said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has paralyzed us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If an appeal is turned down next month, Palermo hopes her
brother can take part in the next prisoner exchange and at least
serve his sentence in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   No less an ordeal confronted Carruth last February. The Lubbock
rancher and businessman and his 17-year-old daughter visited El
Paso for a junior livestock show. Afterward, Carruth decided to
briefly walk into Mexico, a visit that would give his daughter
extra credit in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   But Carruth got turned around. Instead of parking by a downtown
bridge, he took a freeway exit to a second border crossing, which
abruptly leads across the international bridge. Knowing he was not
supposed to take a gun into Mexico, the rancher asked Mexican
officials where he could turn around and he declared the rifle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got on the wrong bridge by mistake and realized too
late,'' he said. ``When we realized what we'd done, there was no
way out. There were hundreds of cars behind us and hundreds ahead.
I declared the rifle right off. I thought that was the right thing
to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they got me for smuggling,'' he said. ``If I had been
trying to do that, I wouldn't have shown them the damn thing.
That's the real gripe I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Carruth and his daughter were taken into custody, and while the
teen-ager was held for eight hours and released to friends, the
rancher wound up in the local jail for three days in conditions
``worse than any hog pen you've seen in your life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After paying lawyers, Carruth was given a suspended two-year
sentence and released in late March after spending 46 days in jail.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to deal with the problem, Mexican politicians have
introduced legal reforms in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials familiar with the measures say the reforms
don't apply to weapons Mexico reserves for military or police use.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need to see is something that addresses all weapons,
because at least 50 percent of our cases involve people with a
military weapon,'' said Leoni, the American consul in Juarez.
``What we think would be very helpful is legislation that would
allow federal officers to exercise more discretion on who they
would consider an arms trafficker.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, El Paso Mayor Carlos Ramirez said he has
developed an agreement, along with the governor-elect of Chihuahua,
the Juarez mayor and police chief and chamber officials, to quickly
intercede in cases of Americans who import weapons by accident.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez said if investigation by police on both sides of the
river shows the American made an honest mistake, U.S. authorities
would ask their Mexican counterparts at the bridge to release the
suspect before the case is entered into the legal system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, once the arraignment has taken place, the
wheels of the Mexican justice system continue to grind,'' Ramirez
said.

OLDER PEOPLE ENJOY SEX, SURVEY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Many older Americans maintain an interest in sex,
with nearly half of those over age 60 engaging in sexual activity
at least once a month, according to a survey released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, commissioned and released by the National Council on
the Aging, found that 39 percent of respondents said they were
satisfied with the amount of sex they were having, while another 39
percent said they wished they had sex more frequently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our study debunks the prevailing myths about sexuality in
older years,'' Dr. James Firman, president of the aging advocacy
organization, said at a news conference. ``We hope that it leads
seniors to more open discussion of their sexuality and to more
rewarding lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Neal Cutler, director of survey results for the council,
said there have been few similar, broad-based surveys of elder
sexuality and that the results should serve as a baseline from
which to measure future changes in attitude and behavior related to
sex among older Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older people are sexually active,'' Cutler said. ``Most older
people are interested in sex, they find sex satisfying and they
consider sex to be an important part of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutler said one of the biggest surprises of the survey was the
emotional satisfaction from sex reported by active seniors. About
74 percent of sexually active men and 70 percent of active women
said they were as satisfied, or even more satisfied, with their sex
lives as they were in their 40s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This satisfaction could reflect a feeling of freedom about sex
that comes with no more fear of pregnancy, having no pressures of
children at home or just having more time to be alone with a
partner and enjoying one another,'' Cutler said.
</P>
<P>
   Active seniors were evenly divided on whether their sex was
physically better now, with 43 percent saying it is just as good as
or better than in their youth and 43 percent say sex is less
satisfying. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 1,292 Americans age 60 or older was conducted this
summer by Roper Starch Worldwide, Inc. The mail survey of 534 men
and 758 women was weighted to match the sex, age, race, income and
marital status of the American population over age 60. The survey
organization put the margin of error at plus or minus 3.5
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The study was financed in part by an unrestricted grant from
Pfizer Inc., which makes the popular anti-impotence drug Viagra.
However, council officials said Pfizer had no role in the design,
conduct or interpretation of the survey and was not informed of the
results before the report was released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Firman said the survey did not delve into sex-enhancement drugs
and treatments that are available now, or expected soon. But he
said these treatments and increased discussion of sexuality among
the elderly may result in even more sexual activity and reported
satisfaction in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marian Dunn, director of the Center for Human Sexuality at
the State University of New York at Brooklyn, said many older
people are misinformed about sex and what to expect as they age.
She noted that one-third of those surveyed felt it was natural to
lose interest in sex as people got older, and that some felt it
became physically impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just isn't true for most people,'' she said. ``While our
bodies change and we respond more slowly or differently, sex is
still possible and enjoyable as we get older.''

JAY REMEMBERS WHEN  
 MIRROR IS HAWAII BOUND  
 MELTDOWN OF A THEORY  
 STUDYING BULNAY FAULT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Iowa, Pa.)   (af)  
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Episodic memory _ being able to recall the when, as well as the
what and where, of an event _ is one of the things that separates
human from hoi polloi in the animal kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Or so it had been thought. Now, researchers from the University
of California at Davis and the University of Cambridge have shown
that a common bird, the scrub jay, has the same ability.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, reporting in the journal Nature, demonstrated
that the jays could remember when they stored certain food. The
scientists used the fact that one of the bird's favorite treats,
wax moth larvae, becomes decidedly less savory over time.
</P>
<P>
   Given a choice between the wax worms and less-favored peanuts,
the birds chose worms first if they had stored them recently, and
last if they had stored them several days before.
</P>
<P>
   The research could eventually help scientists understand how
episodic memory works in the brain. Loss of memory for events is
particularly acute in Alzheimer's patients and others with certain
types of amnesia. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

   One of the world's largest one-piece telescope mirrors is on its
way to Hawaii after being polished to its final shape near
Pittsburgh. The mirror, which is 27 feet in diameter but only 8
inches thick, is destined for the Subaru Telescope on Mauna Kea
near Hilo.
</P>
<P>
   Many large mirrors are made of segments, which can be adjusted
independently to correct for deformations caused by temperature,
wind or gravity as the telescope follows objects across the sky.
Officials with the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan,
which is building the Subaru Telescope, decided on a monolithic
mirror, believing that it would offer better performance,
particularly in the infrared spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Its thinness and flexibility make it adjustable as well: a
computer-controlled array of 261 actuators on the back will alter
the shape of the mirror as needed to keep the images sharp.
</P>
<P>
   How does a 27-foot piece of glass travel from Pittsburgh to the
Pacific? On a truck, first (across three lanes of traffic), then on
a river barge to New Orleans, and finally on a ship through the
Panama Canal. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is a tough journey for that mirror but at least it will not
have to contend with giant snowballs from space.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of California at Berkeley have
dealt a strong blow to a theory that the Earth is being bombarded
by thousands of house-sized icy comets every day, adding water to
the air and seas as they disintegrate high above the planet.
</P>
<P>
   The theory was widely ridiculed when it was proposed in 1986 by
Louis A. Frank, a University of Iowa physicist. Then last year,
Frank announced what appeared to be a stunning confirmation: images
from a polar satellite that appeared to show the comets' tracks.
</P>
<P>
   But the California researchers contend that ``holes'' in the
images that appear to be signs of comets are, in fact, just camera
noise. In papers to be published next month in the journal
Geophysical Research Letters, the scientists say that dark pixels
in the data are consistent with corruption that could be expected
from the satellite's instruments. Frank has been invited to
respond. &QL;

   A team of seismologists, including some from the United States
Geological Survey, has spent the past several weeks in Mongolia
burrowing into the Bulnay fault, which has produced several
magnitude-8 quakes this century.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many faults, the Bulnay occurs not near the junction of
two plates, but in the middle of one, the Eurasian. In this respect
it is similar to the New Madrid fault in the United States, which
lies in the middle of the North American plate and produced major
quakes in 1811-12.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When it comes to the dubious honor of being the
most disliked politician in the nation's capital, House Speaker
Newt Gingrich beats President Clinton every time.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Gingrich outdoes everyone else as well in the
unpopularity sweepstakes. Yet as recently as two months ago he was
giving interviews hinting he might run for president in 2000. What
a guy. Is this a great country or what?
</P>
<P>
   The latest New York Times/CBS Poll, taken after House
Republicans rushed to release the president's videotaped grand jury
testimony about non-sex with Monica Lewinsky, puts Gingrich's
approval rating at a measly 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This is down from his 24 percent rating shortly before the GOP
dumped the four-hour Clinton tape on television with unseemly haste
and even lower down from the 30 percent approval rating he had one
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the president's own job approval ratings actually
went up after his contorted performance, from 58 to 62 percent in a
Newsweek poll and from 60 to 66 percent in a USA Today/CNN Gallup
poll.
</P>
<P>
   I know, I know. Polls go up, polls go down. One does not live by
polls alone.
</P>
<P>
   But, gosh, it's tempting. So the Democrats are doing what comes
naturally by taking on Gingrich, blaming him for stoking the GOP
steam engine that is rushing the House toward impeachment hearings.
The Democrats need to change the subject; What better way than
making the November election into a referendum on Gingrich rather
than on Bill and Monica?
</P>
<P>
   It is legitimate to attack Gingrich. He is not an innocent
bystander in this drama.
</P>
<P>
   He nixed talk of a bipartisan deal that would censure the
president and cancel impeachment hearings, denouncing such a deal
as ``a deliberate effort to short-circuit the rule of law.'' We all
realize enough about the vagaries of the legislative process to
know this is bullfeathers.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich also attacked the president last spring for committing
``crimes,'' verbally convicting Clinton without benefit of law even
though as speaker Gingrich ought to approach such hearings with an
open mind and dedication to due process. Gingrich vowed then never
to make another speech without attacking the president's
``crimes,'' although he abandoned that approach after it got bad
reviews. (Those pesky polls again.)
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich is a visible symbol of the partisanship that infects
the impeachment process. Conservative Republicans love him but they
are the only ones who do.
</P>
<P>
   Many others have never forgiven him for leading the campaign
that ousted his Democratic predecessor as speaker, Jim Wright, over
ethics violations. Gingrich himself has had similar ethical
problems, was reprimanded by the House and is paying off a stiff
fine.
</P>
<P>
   His overall ratings go down every time he raises his voice. He
will never be a popular figure.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, oddly, Gingrich's polarized identity could yet be an asset
to the GOP in the November elections, if conservative Republicans
turn out and Democrats and independents stay home, as everyone now
predicts.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Republican House leadership badly overestimated
the public appetite for the gory details of the Clinton scandal,
the House cannot back away from the impeachment process just yet,
if ever. There is neither enough time nor political will before the
November election for some deal. Gingrich has already urged that
such hearings investigate more than sex, reaching into every
questionable aspect of Clinton's past.
</P>
<P>
   Political momentum makes a House Judiciary Committee vote to
launch hearings inevitable, probably strictly along partisan lines.
But political caution means that nothing will really happen until
both sides see what the newly-elected Congress to convene next
January looks like.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republicans win big, Clinton is toast. The GOP will
interpret its victory as confirmation that voters are behind them;
they will feel no political constraint about going after him, no
matter how unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   If Democrats do well and increase their numbers in both
legislative chambers, that will send a very different signal.
Voters are already impatient with the legal and legislative process
and will surely pressure Congress to resolve the Clinton dilemma in
some way other than a long impeachment drama.
</P>
<P>
   So it becomes crucial for Democrats to galvanize their voters by
scaring them about the likely prospect of a triumphant GOP rolling
the president on charges that basically come down to lying about
illicit sex. Other accusations of abuse of power and witness
tampering made in independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report are
too flimsy to stand up to unbiased scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   For the strategy to work, national figures will have to speak
out. Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman, a Democratic hero for
standing up to denounce Clinton's conduct, would be the most
useful, and Clinton insiders say he may be willing to do it. And if
he takes on Gingrich, attention will be paid.

CONNECTIONS: CLINTON'S WOES ARE A CULTURAL, NOT JUST POLITICAL,
MATTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The image last week was too painful to watch, the president,
shrunken by the camera's high-aimed frame, his forehead pocked with
sweat, responding to questions one wished one hadn't heard.
Germany's chancellor, Helmut Kohl, anticipating the broadcast,
said, ``It makes me vomit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all German chancellors now,'' wrote a columnist in Le
Monde, ``All of this is worthy of vomiting.''
</P>
<P>
   The sentiment, widely expressed abroad and by local critics, was
that something disturbing in American culture was revealed in that
broadcast, a brash immaturity mixed with a ruthless Puritanism, a
variety of sexual McCarthyism mixed with a perverted prurience.
</P>
<P>
   And there was indeed more than enough shame and humiliation to
go around. It was as if one had inadvertently walked into the wrong
privy or seen the poise of a colleague undone by an open fly. One
didn't know whether to be embarrassed for the man stripped of his
presidential persona, or embarrassed by him as he wrestled with
various legalisms in an attempt to patch together a plausible
alternative; embarrassed for the government that was confronted
with the weaknesses and violations of its chief executive, or
embarrassed by its compulsions to strip everything bare. The
private and public had become hopelessly intertwined, all
distinctions gone.
</P>
<P>
   What has not yet been pointed out is that this is a cultural
matter, not just a political one, because to a great extent the
relationship between the private and the public is culture's
terrain. Culture may even be credited with having create
distinctions between public and private in the first place,
creating manners and expectations about what is proper in public
and what is improper even in private, and communicating the secrets
of each realm to the other.
</P>
<P>
   These are great themes in Western art. What, after all, is a
novel, but a private story made public? So many stories are
accounts of intimate thoughts and sensations, chronicles of secret
urges and subtle musings, attempts to articulate the vast mysteries
of interior life. Music participates in that realm as well, giving
voice to the inchoate. Painting and sculpture give it color and
body. If such sensations were easy to express and readily viewable
_ if they were already public _ we would hardly need art and its
subtleties.
</P>
<P>
   But culture is not just the display of the private. It also
delineates the ways in which these private worlds collide and
collude to create a social universe. This is one reason why so many
novels are actually stories about the interaction of private and
public. Anna Karenina commits adultery and is publicly shunned; the
Mayor of Casterbridge sells his wife and scorns his daughter until
he too is publicly humiliated. Herzog, trying to account for his
private shamings by an adulterous wife, writes imaginary letters to
public figures about humankind's parlous state.
</P>
<P>
   Adultery is a major preoccupation of literature: the violation
of the public rules by private desire. So, too, is betrayal: the
violation of a private fact by public disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   So the Clinton mess has a distinguished artistic heritage. But
there is something raw _ almost uncultured _ about it, as if a
delicate balance between public and private had been upset by
multiple villains, leaving nothing unaffected.
</P>
<P>
   Much is at stake. If culture is skewed toward private
preoccupations, art becomes weighed down with pornography or
confession, and politics becomes gossip. If skewed toward public
demands, art leans toward bombast or jingoism, and politics becomes
ideology. And when all distinctions disappear, all public roles
become meaningless poses and all moral assertions mere assertions
of preference and taste.
</P>
<P>
   We seem to be on the verge of fulfilling all of these
possibilities at once. In a much-discussed essay in The Times
Literary Supplement last month, philosopher Thomas Nagel argued
that the ``disastrous erosion of the precious but fragile
conventions of personal privacy in the United States'' is at the
heart of the Clinton mess. Last week, in the online magazine Slate,
he discussed these issues with the editor of Slate, Michael
Kinsley. ``Perhaps you wouldn't trust someone who lied about his
sex life,'' Nagel writes, defending the private realm. ``I wouldn't
trust someone who didn't, some of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton mess is about more than a struggle to keep a
private life from becoming public; the Europeans are vomiting at a
small part of the story. The problem is that we are no longer
certain about what public or private life really is. Private life
has become politicized; public life has become suffused with
private passions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Is sexual discrimination or sexual difference or sexual
preference or sexual education or safe sex a public or a private
matter? Is there a difference between the legal status of
cohabiting partners, once a private relationship, and that of
married partners, a public one? Accusations of sexual harassment,
the origins of this mess, assert violations of public-private
boundaries. But they also shred those boundaries, as private
interactions become subject to public review.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the argument is that Clinton has gone even further in
blurring boundaries, first by using public power for private ends,
then apparently violating public law in an attempt to protect his
private dealings.
</P>
<P>
   So the transgressions of the private realm ascribed to the Starr
report are part of a larger cultural trauma. In fact, one reason
why the mess has deepened so quickly and why the report has come to
seem its extension rather than its resolution is that while the
private is weakened, the public is no stronger. What authority can
it claim? What transcendent vision? What allegiance does it
command?
</P>
<P>
   The public voice seems so ruthless now partly because it is so
uncertain of its authority. (Indeed, a good portion of the public
is uncertain about whether it should even possess authority.) And
this weakness, too, is bound up in the Clinton presidency. While
Nagel points out the ``precious but fragile conventions'' of the
private realm, Clinton, from the very first, wanted to undo some of
the ``precious but fragile conventions'' of the public realm.
</P>
<P>
   This was what was happening when Clinton the candidate donned
sunglasses and played ``Heartbreak Hotel'' on Arsenio Hall's show
or when, as president, he talked about his underwear. The
conventions of the presidency were made to seem pretentious,
arbitrary, a matter of whimsy. And this did, of course, reflect
itself in cultural life.
</P>
<P>
   During the televised inaugural concert in 1993 Clinton clapped
and nodded and swayed along with the rock and pop singers, sang
along with ``We Are the World,'' thrilled to a serenade from Bob
Dylan and was hailed as ``Big Bill'' in a rap by L.L. Cool J. The
image of presidential authority was replaced by a celebration of
counter-cultural homogenization. The television and movie stars
there, like Oprah Winfrey or Jack Nicholson, only seemed to be
paying homage to Clinton and his office; actually, he was paying
tribute to them as the only American elite.
</P>
<P>
   The pain in watching Clinton last week recalled the milder
embarrassment caused by this earlier display, partly for similar
reasons: Where, in all of this, was the presidency or governance?
Public life is partly a life of personas and roles, of law and
hierarchies, of trust and bonds. The embarrassment of the concert
was at seeing a president reluctant to take on that public mantle;
the embarrassment last week was at seeing a president unable to
remove his private one. And the embarrassment in both is that we,
the people, have established a culture in which neither has a place
or seems particularly worth preserving.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Medical authorities, educators and civil-rights lawyers,
concerned about a sudden drop in minority enrollment in the
nation's medical schools, are striking back at moves to fight
affirmative action that they believe threaten the future health of
minority communities.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of 51 medical associations is mobilizing forces and
raising money to help defeat a Nov. 3 voter initiative in the state
of Washington that would ban any form of affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   And minority groups as well as higher education leaders are
conducting research and planning court strategies to challenge the
movement against affirmative action. The coalition opposing the
ballot measure, representing some two million medical
professionals, includes the American Medical Association and the
American Nurses Association.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington vote, called Initiative 200, is one of several
drives that have been undertaken against affirmative action in
recent years. Since 1996, a federal appeals court has ordered a
rollback in affirmative-action programs in Texas, Louisiana and
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits are also in progress to ban affirmative action in
Michigan and Maryland. And California's Board of Regents has
effectively banned affirmative action at state universities.
</P>
<P>
   First-year minority entrants at medical schools declined by a
total of 12 percent from 1994 to 1997. Applications continued to
rise in 1994, 1995 and 1996, but then dropped in 1997 by 11
percent, studies by the American Association of Medical Colleges
show.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1997, there were 1,770 new entrants from
minorities representing African-Americans, Mexican-Americans,
mainland Puerto Ricans, American Indians and Native Alaskans. These
minorities accounted for 11 percent of the 16,165 matriculating
medical students. In both 1996 and 1997, black medical schools had
slight increases in enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   Those minority groups represent about 21 percent of the nation's
total population. Asian-Americans and some Hispanic-Americans were
not underrepresented in medical schools and were not included in
the study. The association had originally hoped to have 3,000
entering students by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Herbert Nickens, the association's vice president for
community and minority affairs, said that in the past two years
``the anti-affirmative-action drive has really started hitting us,
and our progress is slipping.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Sundwall, chairman of the Council on Graduate Medical
Education, an advisory group for Congress and the Secretary of
Health and Human Services, said in an interview: ``The nation's
health depends on access to doctors who reflect the nation's
increasingly diverse population. Minority doctors are much more
likely to set up practices in minority neighborhoods, and they are
needed badly there.''
</P>
<P>
   For a variety of economic and societal reasons, many illnesses
are more common and more deadly among minorities than in the
general population. For example, black children have
hospitalization rates for asthma about three times those of whites.
A significant reason is that there are fewer doctors and
health-care centers in inner-cities, where most of the sufferers
live.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, annual death rates for blacks in general are about 50
percent higher than for whites, lowering life expectancy by about
five years for women and eight years for men.
</P>
<P>
   Sundwall said that despite gains in the 1970s and 1980s,
minority representation appeared to be decreasing at all levels _
from medical school faculty members, to faculty members in key
positions, to initial student applications to acceptances.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, in testifying in Washington last week before the
Joint Commission on the Future of Medicare, which provides $7
billion to programs for teaching hospitals and graduate medical
education, Sundwall urged the commissioners not to cut back on
funds used to encourage minority medical school representation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jordan Cohen, president of the Association of American Medical
Colleges, said: ``Until we get to the point where we have an
applicant pool that contains all sectors of our society with
equivalent academic credentials, we will not get out from under the
need to make special efforts to identify quality applicants across
all those sectors.'' He added that the ultimate challenge is to
repair educational disadvantages that exist so that the broad,
diverse applicant pools will form.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict over medical-school admissions policies and
minority representation stems from a 1978 case involving Alan
Bakke, a white premed student who applied to the medical school at
the University of California at Davis. Though he had a slightly
higher grade-point average and better scores on the Medical-College
Admission Test (MCAT) than several black applicants, he was turned
down on the basis of his race to enable the school to achieve a
minimum racial quota of minority students.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court ruled for Bakke, saying a decision made
solely on the basis of his race amounted to reverse discrimination.
But in the second part of that ruling, the court allowed race to be
considered as one of many factors in admissions decisions.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1996 and subsequent rulings by the 5th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals for Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi effectively
reversed the second part of the Bakke decision. Civil rights
groups, including the Legal Defense Fund, challenged the appeals
court's right to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Wading into the fray, Derek Bok, former president of Harvard
University, and William Bowen, former president of Princeton
University, have completed a study of the grades, test scores,
choice of major, graduation rates, careers and attitudes of 45,000
students at 28 selective universities over 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   They concluded that affirmative-action policies in general at
the nation's elite colleges have created the backbone of the
American black middle class and have taught white classmates the
value of integration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most drastic effects in eliminating affirmative action
would be on medical and law schools,'' Bok said, ``because the more
selective the institution, the greater the impact, and nothing is
more selective that medical schools and law schools.''
</P>
<P>
   The dean at the Harvard Medical School, Dr. Joseph Martin, who
was chancellor at the University of California at San Francisco
during the bitter controversy over the Board of Regents action two
years ago, said: ``I feel extremely strongly about the importance
of diversity among medical school graduates. I am very troubled
about the decline in applications and matriculations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard Medical School has had an average 20 percent
minority enrollment in the last five years and is now in its 30th
year of pursuing affirmative-action policies. Dean Martin said it
receives some 4,000 applications a year and makes a first cut to
800 applicants based on college grade-point averages and MCAT
scores.
</P>
<P>
   The admissions officers then make decisions relying on a variety
of considerations, including academic performance judged in ways
other than from test scores, nonacademic accomplishments,
backgrounds and leadership ability. ``We have no intention of
abandoning affirmative action,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Shaw, a counsel for the Legal Defense Fund, called the
attack on all forms of affirmative action ``an attack by wolves in
wolves' clothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Dockery, a premed student at Xavier University of
Louisiana, a historically black college, said he personally was not
being discouraged in his goal of becoming a doctor because of the
anti-affirmative action efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's just one more hurdle,'' he said. ``And you do have
to look at the problem from all perspectives. It may seem unfair to
white students if they have good grades but they are kept out
because minority representation is considered. On the other hand, a
whole range of disadvantages have worked against minorities and
something has to be done for them to level the playing field.'' &QL;

   China is modernizing so fast that it is sometimes hard to get a
good feel for yesterday, let alone its ancient past. So, though it
is a bit difficult to get to, the ancient walled city of Pingyao,
about 430 miles from Beijing, is well worth a trip.
</P>
<P>
   Pingyao, once the prosperous banking capital of China, but in
recent years just another dusty faraway town, is now being
restored. The only fully walled city left in China, it was declared
a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Now is an ideal time to visit: The city's beautiful carved wood
facades and elaborately painted street signs have been restored
enough to capture Pingyao's former glory, but real people are still
living in many of its late Ming Dynasty buildings from the 17th
century. And when I visited in April, the souvenir stands that
sprout like weeds at the Great Wall and other sites still had not
cluttered the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The approach to Pingyao, on roads that cut across the parched
brown fields of the now-poor Shanxi Province, gives a sense of what
a grand old place this must have been, its mammoth gray wall, with
70 watchtowers, rising out of the plains. Over the years, the city
has outgrown its wall, and a ragtag collection of shops, small
factories and even outdoor pool halls now hugs the outer perimeter.
But historic treasures lie within.
</P>
<P>
   The main entrance to the city, with its population of 400,000,
is now through the west gate of the wall, which was first built in
A.D. 77 and rebuilt in 1370. One first enters a sort of small, deep
holding chamber, where in ancient times soldiers on the turrets
high above could scan new arrivals and decide if they should be
shot with bows and arrows or let in. (A souvenir shop has replaced
the former trap.)
</P>
<P>
   Once admitted through a second door, one can climb a steep ramp
onto the top of the wall, getting a bird's-eye view of Pingyao as
well as the surrounding plains. The path on top is as wide as a
street, and can be explored on foot or bicycle (rented through the
Ancient City of Pingyao Tourism Development Corp.).
</P>
<P>
   There were 2,000 walled cities in China when the Communists came
to power in 1949, and almost all were left to crumble or were
actively torn down, said Li Youhua, an expert in local history who
was one of our guides. The party believed that walls interfered
with progress and development, and in 1979 the wall of Pingyao was
scheduled for demolition. But the townspeople rose in defense of a
structure that had protected them for almost 2,000 years, and in
the end the wall was allowed to stay.
</P>
<P>
   From atop the wall, one gets a fine view of modern China's many
facets: Look inside and you see a bustling, dusty rural town with
bicycles and motorcycles charging this way and that, resembling a
Chinese version of Dodge City. Face out, especially north, and
there are fields laboriously farmed by small groups as far as the
eye can see.
</P>
<P>
   On the north side of the wall, a great wooden-beamed pagoda is
being lovingly reconstructed from memory (no pictures exist) to
recreate the ancient, historic North Gate. But the northwest
portion of the town is crammed with unsightly coal-powered
factories making trains, beef products and textiles _ the sorry
byproduct of China's headlong drive to build a modern socialist
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Climbing down from the wall it is possible to head for the old
part of town, to wander through some late Ming Dynasty courtyard
homes. Four hundred are listed for protection in Pingyao and most
are still inhabited by a family _ or three or four. Under the
socialist redistribution of property in the late 1950s, these large
complexes were subdivided and many families were forced to share
their homes with poorer folk.
</P>
<P>
   One of the measures UNESCO proposed to return the city to its
former beauty was reducing the number of people and factories in
the city, so some of both are being relocated outside the wall.
</P>
<P>
   It is worth hiring a Chinese-speaking guide to take you into
Pingyao's protected homes, since this will provide more chances to
interact with local residents. Off the narrow street named Guan Di
Miao Jie, for example, is the grand but somewhat dilapidated Chen
family compound, where Chen Ligong, a descendant of the original
owners, lives with his wife and four other families.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, shuffling in an old Mao suit, proudly opens elaborately
carved wooden doors and ushers visitors into the dark hollows of
his cement-floored five-room home. In the small anteroom that
doubles as a kitchen, he pulls back a beautiful screen painted with
chrysanthemums, revealing an elaborate shrine to Chairman Mao. A
portrait of a handsome young Mao as well as a huge poster of Mao
with his generals adorn the back wall; red banners bearing Mao's
poems flank either side. On a low table beneath the pictures are
candles and offerings of pots filled with rice and corn. ``I
worship no other god,'' Chen says.
</P>
<P>
   Even in this very average neighborhood, still largely
unrestored, the one-story gray-brick and wood buildings that line
the narrow dirt streets are here and there adorned by the vivid
painted wooden eves and signs that make Pingyao such a jewel. Some
of the pictures tell stories and others loudly announce the
building's occupant, such as a big clock indicating a watch shop.
</P>
<P>
   One focal point of a visit should be Ming Qing Jie, a milelong
street of ancient banks and shops that is being restored. The
street was once home to the city's piao haos, the first banks in
China and perhaps in the world. It is a testament to the cycles of
fortune: hard proof that this now-dusty provincial town miles from
anywhere was indeed the banking capital of China at one time.
Pingyao's banks, which opened in the early 19th century, went out
of business just after the start of the 20th century as China's
business moved to the coast and its banking center to Shanghai.
Communications were bad and Pingyao is not exactly a convenient
place to make deposits.
</P>
<P>
   After the Communists took over in 1949, some of these grand
buildings served as department stores and others played host to the
local Public Security Bureau. Many, like the Ri Sheng Shang Piao
Hao (Sun Rising Prosperity Bank) or the Bai Chuan Tong Piao Hao
(One Hundred Rivers Flow Together Bank), have been turned into
small museums and are being restored.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the One Hundred Rivers Flow Together Bank, elaborate carved
wooden grates featuring bats and flowers adorn courtyard windows,
and a sign bearing beautiful gold calligraphy declares: ``A Hundred
Rivers Flow Into the Sea.'' For a hundred years, banks like this
issued notes that served as cash and allowed traders to travel
unburdened by bars of silver.
</P>
<P>
   Just down the road at the Sun Rising Prosperity Bank, which
operated from 1824 to 1932, visitors can leaf through old mail from
Pingyao and handwritten records of deposits, withdrawals and loans.
</P>
<P>
   Along Qing Ming Jie, the city is restoring the facade of many of
the buildings, and their painted wooden eaves are breathtakingly
beautiful, adorned with muted paintings of delicate vases, flowers
and folk tales _ including the story of Mulan, borrowed this year
by Disney.
</P>
<P>
   A number of the street's stores and houses are still occupied,
and many of the residents run small shops from their homes. Guo
Huairen, the seventh generation of his family to live in his
courtyard house, oversees a mini-conglomerate, including a small
store in his front room. He makes and sells rice wine. He is a
doctor of herbal medicine. He runs a street-side sweet shop selling
the Chinese equivalent of doughnuts. And the Society for the
History of Pingyao inhabits a room on his grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Guo is affable and willing to give tours of the complex, which
include his distillery, a room for practicing calligraphy, and
side-by-side, then-and-now, incense-filled shrines. One features
the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and poems commemorating the
return of Hong Kong. The second honors more traditional Chinese
deities: the Buddhist goddess Guanyin and the 72 disciples of
Confucius.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the street is the Market Tower, whose short but
treacherously steep stone stairs are worth climbing for the
wonderful view of the tiled roofs of the old part of the city, many
built in the late Ming period around the middle of the 17th
century. On top is yet another shrine featuring an eclectic mix of
Taoist and Buddhist gods.
</P>
<P>
   Most tourists going to Pingyao will have to spend the nights
before and after about 75 miles away in Taiyuan, the coal mining
city that is the capital of Shanxi Province. The road between
Taiyuan and Pingyao has an added enticement for those with an
interest in central China's lost prosperity and energy to spare:
the fortresslike Qiao Family Compound, once the home of a wealthy
trading family and more recently made famous as the set for Zhang
Yimou's spectacular film ``Raise the Red Lantern.''
</P>
<P>
   It is truly huge, with dozens of courtyards and over 100 rooms.
But for those transfixed by the color and spectacle of that movie,
the plain gray courtyards may seem disappointingly drab _ though
they nonetheless offer an interesting glimpse of how the family
lived, with carefully crafted dioramas and re-creations of numerous
rooms, from dining rooms to wedding chambers.
</P>
<P>
   The compound, seen by the Communists as an embarrassing symbol
of capitalism, was also seized after the Revolution, at one point
serving as the local party school. During the Cultural Revolution
it came close to destruction at the hands of the Red Guards.
</P>
<P>
   But today, China's leaders are once again embracing commerce and
extolling the market economy. And a happy result for travelers is
that once-shunned places like Pingyao and the Qiao Family Compound
_ sites that evoke China's vibrant commercial past _ are finally
being revived.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling to Pingyao is inconvenient, partly because its tourist
industry is still embryonic. Local officials say that 1,000 people
a week visit, but most are Chinese who are generally a lot more
forgiving in the kinds of accommodation they will accept. Spring
and fall are the best times to visit; summer can be too hot.
</P>
<P>
   Pingyao is a good half day's travel from Beijing. Since the town
currently lacks a Western-standard hotel, most travelers stay in
the provincial capital of Taiyuan, where there are good hotels, and
make the two-hour drive to Pingyao. There are many reasonably
priced ways to get from Beijing to Taiyuan, including a one-hour
flight _ about $55 one way, with $1 worth about 8.5 renminbi (also
called the yuan) _ an overnight train or a four-and-a-half-hour
drive on a newly completed highway. While the 11-hour train from
Beijing to Taiyuan is comfortable (about $20 for a soft bed) and
saves a night in a hotel, it is time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   The Shanxi Grand Hotel, telephone (86-351) 4043901, in Taiyuan
is pleasant and comfortable. Rooms are about $80 with the 15
percent tax. The hotel can arrange a car and driver to take you to
Pingyao (about $60) and a tour guide ($35). The Taiyuan National
Tourism Office, (86-351) 7232188, extension 2706, can also make
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   The Ancient City of Pingyao Tourism Development Corp. (86-354)
5621548) arranges tours for about $1 a person, but does not have
English-speaking guides, so you must bring an interpreter-guide.
The corporation also rents bikes for riding on the wall for $3.

CAP'N MICKEY SETS SAIL: DISNEY EXTENDS ITS EMPIRE TO THE HIGH SEAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CANAVERAL, Fla. _ In the two months since the ship was
officially launched, travel writers from around the world have set
sail on the Disney Magic to critique the Walt Disney Co.'s entry
into the cruise industry.
</P>
<P>
   Their published complaints have been almost identical:
</P>
<P>
   _ The elevators are too small.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some of the food served in the ship's three theme restaurants
could be improved.
</P>
<P>
   _ No X- or even R-rated jokes are told in the comedy club.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the nit-picking. Disney, having conquered the theme park,
movie, cable TV and toy industries, became the big fish in the
cruise business the moment Disney Magic's foghorn blasted out the
first notes of ``When You Wish Upon a Star'' and the ship's
83,000-ton bulk moved away from the Port Canaveral pier in late
July en route to the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   From lower-deck theaters, shops and eateries to a crow's-nest
sports bar; from massive (25 percent larger than industry average)
staterooms to cushiony deck chairs; from homemade ice cream dished
up by 24-hour room service to savory steak in Lumiere's dining room
(OK, the veal wasn't all that good), Disney Magic has it all.
Instead of finding fault, the real challenge is discovering
something you want that the Disney corporate imagineers DIDN'T
already think of and make available.
</P>
<P>
   CAN THIS REALLY BE A SHIP?: Port Canaveral is a spit of land
adjacent to the Space Age cape, but you'll see the Disney Magic
long before you arrive there. From almost 10 miles away, the ship's
smokestacks are visible, towering above sea and palm trees and
Cocoa Beach office buildings and even, it seems, low-flying clouds.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the ship is overwhelming. It is 964 feet long (the
equivalent of three football fields plus part of a fourth) and 106
feet wide. Disney Magic's 875 cabins can accommodate a maximum of
2,400 passengers; its 11 decks include special areas for toddlers,
grade-school kids, teen-agers and grown-ups. Almost any amenities,
from massages to exotic beers, can be had just by asking any member
of the 800-strong crew.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers alone, though, aren't what make Disney Magic such a
success. Predictably, the Mouse Company has spared no expense
making its first ship first-class from bow to stern. Everything is
carved teak and marble, the plushest of the plush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, Brucie,'' one mom cooed to her 5-year-old as they
crossed the gangplank and entered the Disney Magic foyer with its
seashell chandelier, piano player and entrances to exotic shops.
``Are we on a ship or in a hotel?''
</P>
<P>
   Brucie hadn't the foggiest; he raced for the massive metal
statue of Seaman Mickey that dominates the lobby area. Except for
some costumed characters/greeters at the art deco check-in building
on the Port Canaveral pier, that Mickey statue is all passengers
are required to see of Mr. Mouse for the duration of their journey,
except for various wall hangings, Mickey souvenirs and stateroom
fixtures. Although Disney obviously hopes to attract lots of family
cruise business, the company also is aiming for the single and
married-without-children adult market. So Mickey &AMP; Co. swarm decks
reserved for juvenile passengers, but they're scarce in
grown-ups-only areas.
</P>
<P>
   FUN FOR ALL AGES: The 11 Disney Magic decks are as convenient to
each other, yet as distinct, as, say, Fantasyland and Tomorrowland
in Walt Disney World. One deck is entirely reserved for the
kindergarten crowd; it is an exact replica of Captain Hook's ship,
complete with games, elaborate costumes, and adult ``cast members''
trained to keep kids entertained with scavenger hunts and
role-playing activities. A few decks away is ``Common Grounds,'' a
coffee shop exclusively for teen-agers. It boasts an incomparable
assemblage of the latest video games, every imaginable CD,
large-screen TVs and game tables. Parents who've dropped their kids
off don't have to worry about whether they're OK. Moms and dads are
issued pagers so they can receive periodic updates on their
offspring.
</P>
<P>
   The same choice of generational separation or togetherness is
true of Castaway Cay, the Bahamian island acquired by Disney and
the ultimate destination on its cruise. Three- and four-day
maritime packages are offered. Both include ``just cruising
around,'' according to Disney Magic Capt. Tom Forberg, who was
hired away from competitor Norwegian American Line. Each package
features a lengthy stopover in Nassau, the better to lure folks who
like to gamble aboard the Disney Line. There's no casino on Disney
Magic, so inveterate dice-rollers can enjoy Nassau's gaming
establishments while the rest of the ship's passengers amuse
themselves sightseeing.
</P>
<P>
   All cruises end up, though, at Castaway Cay, whose white sands
and blue/green/turquoise waves would elicit moans of pleasure from
the most travel-hardened cruise buffs. The cay includes family
beaches, beaches just for kids, and adults-only areas, the latter
being easily recognizable by their profusion of massage kiosks.
There are also bike trails through the jungle (discus-sized crabs
scrabble across the path), sailboats and canoes, a few souvenir
stands (fewer than Disney-scoffers might anticipate, though),
waterside bars, reggae musicians and only one place to eat, a very
mediocre barbecue stand that canny Disney execs will undoubtedly
upgrade ASAP.
</P>
<P>
   MORE  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE SHOW GOES ON: ``Disney'' is synonymous with
``entertainment.'' Any luxury cruise ship can provide fancy meals,
reasonably roomy accommodations and pleasant crew members. It's a
safe bet nobody will be able to match Disney Magic and its theater.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a cramped little auditorium. It's a roomy venue with
a different show every night, each having a fantasy theme and all
involving lots of music, gorgeous scenery and special effects. The
end result is musical entertainment on a par with Broadway shows.
``Ghost Ships'' is especially enjoyable, with its theme of nautical
poltergeists.
</P>
<P>
   There are also several theme bars, with jazz, rock and country
music available. The comedy club concentrates on nonscatology; we
may be certain it will be the last place Bill and Monica jokes will
be told. A shipboard gymnasium has all the requisite pulleys,
weights and treadmills. Between-meal hunger pangs are assuaged by
visits to innumerable snack bars, where pizza, hamburgers, ice
cream and other treats are yours for the asking. Aside from
alcohol, when you pay for your Disney Magic ticket, you've paid for
everything. (That's excluding tips; as on all other cruise ships,
sailing aboard Disney Magic requires significant wallet-diving at
journey's end to provide gratuities. Once all servers, stateroom
custodians and other helpful crew types have been tipped, expect to
be out another $100 or so.)
</P>
<P>
   In the mood for a movie? Disney Magic has its own Dolby-quality
theater, heavy on the Disney titles, of course, but at least
offering a respectable selection of these. There's cable TV in the
staterooms for those who lack enough energy and/or imagination to
do anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of staterooms, Disney Magic passengers embarking on
their first cruises ever may wonder why there's so much hoopla
about the size of the ship's sleeping accommodations. Truthfully,
the biggest Disney Magic stateroom isn't that much bigger than a
typical room at the Motel 6. But shipboard rooms are always
significantly smaller than those in roadside motels; there's only
so much space for them on the biggest ships, after all. But the
more expensive staterooms include verandas, and many of the Disney
Magic rooms even feature split bathrooms _ shower in one, toilet in
the other _ for family convenience.
</P>
<P>
   THE EFFECT ON YOUR WALLET: Such vacation decadence doesn't come
cheap _ but it does come significantly cheaper than most of the
Disney PR about its cruise line might lead you to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Mouse Corp. wants to attract adult trade aboard
Magic, married couples and honeymooners especially, it is wishing
upon a star for well-heeled families to combine Disney World and
Disney Magic in a super seven-day vacation package. Accordingly,
the majority of Disney Magic ads tout all-in-one packages; for a
specific fee, guests have paid for round-trip air fare, park
admission, hotel accommodations on land and all the shipboard
amenities at sea. Prices here start around $1,295 and escalate
based on cabin preferences. Three-day cruise fares, including air
fare but not Disney World, begin at $799.
</P>
<P>
   It is entirely possible to enjoy Disney Magic for significantly
less. On the ship's inaugural cruise, Disney spokesman Al Weiss
said that all the three-day cruise fun could be had ``for as low as
$379 a person, if people drive to Port Canaveral so there's no air
fare, and if they take the lowest-priced cabin onboard.''
</P>
<P>
   You may be certain Disney Magic's ``lowest-priced cabin'' is not
equivalent to steerage on a coal tanker. Besides, you're not going
to spend much time in the cabin, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   FAMILY-FRIENDLY: In just a few months, Disney has significantly
changed the cruise industry by making competing cruise lines more
``kid-friendly.'' Several competitors have already adopted Disney's
daylong child-care programs. Mega-competitor Norwegian Cruise Line
has announced an Enhanced Kids Crew program that, for the first
time, includes fun and games for the 3- to 5-year-old bracket. The
Disney Magic hoopla has more families considering shipboard
vacations, and rival cruise companies want their slice of that
financial plum pudding. The end result, probably before 1998 is
through, will be lots of discount family fares, industrywide. Ask
your travel agent to keep track of this.
</P>
<P>
   As for Disney Magic, perhaps the most valid criticism is that
there isn't much to criticize. As with its theme parks, Disney is
determined to control every factor of its guests' experiences. The
more adventuresome among Disney Magic's passengers may decide
everything about their cruise is too controlled, from what time
they may see each show in the ship's theater each night to the
order in which they may dine in Disney Magic's various theme
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   What the heck. Cap'n Mickey and the rest of the Disney Magic
crew want you to enjoy the best.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   It is possible to enjoy a three-day Disney Magic cruise for as
little as $379. Travel agents can book your cruise, or you may call

   My aunt, Dorothy Harvey, who is 96, is the last surviving member
of my mother's rather large family. She lives in Michigan and
although age has taken its toll on her body, her mind is sharp and
she is well versed in matters of the day. She is a hidebound
Republican and lets you know it.
</P>
<P>
   I call her regularly and, on occasion, have bantered with her
about the goings-on in the White House. I did so recently, after
the President's famous speech following his grand jury testimony,
and she launched into an expression of her feelings on the matter.
Eventually winding down, she paused briefly, then said slowly,
``But you know, I was never quite sure about Warren Harding.''

   One in a thousand? A million? Eileen Leeds, who lives in
Stamford, Conn., was recently on a Madison Avenue bus en route to
the Museum of the City of New York. As the bus approached the 90s,
most of the passengers had left and Ms. Leeds chatted with the
driver. Several hours later, Ms. Leeds left the museum. It had
started raining, there wasn't a cab in sight and, wet and
miserable, she headed for Lexington Avenue. Where could she find
shelter until the rain eased, she wondered, looking at the nearby
stores. Suddenly and to her great surprise because it wasn't a bus
stop, a Lexington Avenue bus pulled up, stopped and the horn
honked. The doors flew open and a voice cut through the downpour
and said, ``Hop in.'' It was the bus driver she had had on her
original journey. Talk about customer relations!

   It was one of the last performances of ``Colin Quinn: An Irish
Wake'' at the Helen Hayes Theater. A disgruntled theatergoer,
sitting near Laura Pedersen, returned from the concession area and

they won't even let you bring a drink to your seat.''

   They didn't need the coming revival of ``On the Town'' to
inspire them _ Sidney Sandler gave his prescription information to

participants.

   My 6-year-old grandniece, Katharine MacComber, following her
parents' example, has become interested in the fat content of food.
One day recently, she and her mother visited my daughter at the
hospital, who was nursing her new son. Katharine had never seen a
mother nursing and was quite taken with the procedure. The
following morning she asked her mother ``Is a mommy's milk 1
percent or skim?''

   Elfin Frederick Vogel is still curious about what social
disaster he might have prevented. He was riding his bike home,
wearing a tie after a tieless casual summer, and stopped for a red
light at Third Avenue and 16th Street. A man, probably in his late
50s, approached him, wearing well-tailored slacks, blue blazer and
crisp shirt, but no tie. ``Would you sell me your tie?'' the man
asked. ``I'll give you $20 for it.'' The exchange was made. Vogel

   Lawrence H. Zisman understands that there are many mysteries in
life, from how the great pyramids in ancient Egypt were built to
when the universe will end. He even understands that there are more
than occasional mysteries involving the U.S. Postal Service. Still,
he wonders how a postcard sent from the La Jolla Presbyterian
Church in La Jolla, Calif., to a church member who lives on Azul
Street, also in La Jolla, was delivered to him in East Windsor,
N.J., along with his bills, magazines and sweepstakes entry forms.
</P>
<P>
   The card announced the date of a future ministry committee
meeting. Zisman called the California church so it could get in

possible reason behind the rerouting _ could it have been a divine
message to convert to Presbyterianism and move to California? Who

   My sister-in-law was married to a prominent surgeon who
specialized in open-heart surgery. A member of operating teams at
two hospitals in the Chicago area, St. Francis and Christ, he would
operate in the morning and field calls in the evening about his
patients from the resident staffs. One evening during a visit, the
doctor was on the telephone talking to a resident at Christ
Hospital when the other phone rang. My sister-in-law answered, then
whispered to the doctor, ``It's St. Francis calling.''
</P>
<P>
   He whispered back: ``Tell St. Francis I'll have to call back.
I'm talking to Christ.''

on remaining anonymous, says that he recently wrote a professor at
Arizona State University but couldn't recall its location. He
guessed it was Tempe and went along with that.
</P>
<P>
   As he approached the box to mail his letter, a jogger happened
along wearing a sweatshirt emblazoned Arizona State University. He
stopped her, showed her the envelope and asked, ``Is Tempe,

   Our good buddy, heavyweight champ Evander Holyfield, admitted
yesterday that he's fathered two children out of wedlock to two
different former girlfriends in the past year. But the good news
is, according to Bill Clinton's definition of sex, nothing improper
was done.
</P>
<P>
   You know the Clinton testimony is already out on tape? You can
buy it for $9.95. I think it's called 'White Men Can Hump.'
</P>
<P>
   You can tell summer is over. It's getting a little chilly
outside. Back in Washington, D.C., it was so chilly, Monica
Lewinsky was playing with lit cigars.

change the name of the town to something less embarrassing. So I
guess they're getting rid of the New Jersey part.

   Yesterday, President Clinton's four-hour taped videotaped
testimony aired on national television. When asked about it, the
President said, 'That was the least fun I ever had talking about
sex.'''
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky apparently said that she never wore the infamous
blue dress again because Linda Tripp told her it made her look fat.
That's mostly because the President ejaculates in horizontal
stripes.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, President Clinton's meeting with the Prime Minister
of Japan was scheduled for 10 minutes, and it lasted for two hours.
Which is interesting because his meetings with Monica Lewinsky were

the Cleveland group spent the vast majority of its time rehearsing
in a loft, drinking, fighting with each other, and making a
somewhat crude racket that suggested Captain Beefheart jamming with
the Stooges _ with a little free jazz on the side. Well the Eels
were great _ great in a messy, half-formed, over-amped way, but
great nonetheless: They were punk _ or New Wave or whatever _ years
before the Ramones and the Damned and the Sex Pistols released
anything. By DAVE FERMAN. Story will move in ``e'' entertainment

   UNDATED _ I found it interesting that much of the debate in
Congress about whether to make public President Clinton's
videotaped testimony to a grand jury was conducted in secret. That
says a lot about holders of public office. It seems that many who
were once candidates for public office undergo quite a
metamorphosis when they become holders of the office. Their
attitude about the First Amendment and the public's right to know
undergoes considerable change. By PHIL RECORD. Story has moved in

   My aunt, Dorothy Harvey, who is 96, is the last surviving member
of my mother's rather large family. She lives in Michigan and
although age has taken its toll on her body, her mind is sharp and
she is well versed in matters of the day. She is a hidebound
Republican and lets you know it.
</P>
<P>
   I call her regularly and, on occasion, have bantered with her
about the goings-on in the White House. I did so recently, after
the President's famous speech following his grand jury testimony,
and she launched into an expression of her feelings on the matter.
Eventually winding down, she paused briefly, then said slowly,
``But you know, I was never quite sure about Warren Harding.''

   One in a thousand? A million? Eileen Leeds, who lives in
Stamford, Conn., was recently on a Madison Avenue bus en route to
the Museum of the City of New York. As the bus approached the 90s,
most of the passengers had left and Ms. Leeds chatted with the
driver. Several hours later, Ms. Leeds left the museum. It had
started raining, there wasn't a cab in sight and, wet and
miserable, she headed for Lexington Avenue. Where could she find
shelter until the rain eased, she wondered, looking at the nearby
stores. Suddenly and to her great surprise because it wasn't a bus
stop, a Lexington Avenue bus pulled up, stopped and the horn
honked. The doors flew open and a voice cut through the downpour
and said, ``Hop in.'' It was the bus driver she had had on her
original journey. Talk about customer relations!

   It was one of the last performances of ``Colin Quinn: An Irish
Wake'' at the Helen Hayes Theater. A disgruntled theatergoer,
sitting near Laura Pedersen, returned from the concession area and
complained to seated friends, ``They call this an Irish wake, but
they won't even let you bring a drink to your seat.''
</P>
<P>
   They didn't need the coming revival of ``On the Town'' to
inspire them _ Sidney Sandler gave his prescription information to
the order taker for the AARP Pharmacy Service in Pennsylvania. He
followed this with his address and ended with ``New York, New
York.'' The following exchange ensued, short but a delight to both
participants.
</P>
<P>
   Order taker: ``It's a hell of a town.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandler: ``The Bronx is up.''
</P>
<P>
   Order taker: ``And the Battery is down.''

   My 6-year-old grandniece, Katharine MacComber, following her
parents' example, has become interested in the fat content of food.
One day recently, she and her mother visited my daughter at the
hospital, who was nursing her new son. Katharine had never seen a
mother nursing and was quite taken with the procedure. The
following morning she asked her mother ``Is a mommy's milk 1
percent or skim?''

   Elfin Frederick Vogel is still curious about what social
disaster he might have prevented. He was riding his bike home,
wearing a tie after a tieless casual summer, and stopped for a red
light at Third Avenue and 16th Street. A man, probably in his late
50s, approached him, wearing well-tailored slacks, blue blazer and
crisp shirt, but no tie. ``Would you sell me your tie?'' the man
asked. ``I'll give you $20 for it.'' The exchange was made. Vogel
pedaled off, but not before he saw the man put on the tie and smile
at the well-dressed woman next to him. Vogel pegged the woman's
look as equal parts of awe and disbelief.

Bagwell, Biggio not lone stars 
as Astros have best season ever
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Jeff Bagwell and Craig Biggio.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Biggio and Jeff Bagwell.
</P>
<P>
   Ask any Houstonian, or baseball fan for that matter, to name an
Astro, and one of those two names _ or even both _ will pop out.
</P>
<P>
   BagwellBiggio.
</P>
<P>
   BiggioBagwell.
</P>
<P>
   The two are so closely linked in the mind that the name
``Bigwell'' almost escapes the lips.
</P>
<P>
   But these are two very distinctly different players _ on the
field, that is. Bagwell, with his broad shoulders, square jaw and
Popeye-like forearms, is the very picture of your power-hitting
first baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio, of the quick bat and even quicker feet, is darned-near
your perfect base-stealing leadoff man.
</P>
<P>
   Off the field, though, they are very similar. Both are as intent
on deflecting praise and media attention in the clubhouse as they
are in racking up runs and big plays on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just play the game,'' said Bagwell with a shrug. ``I go out
every day and play the best that I can. I've had some great years
and I've had a couple of bad years. This year, I don't know if I
would consider it a personally great year, but it's been the most
fun I've had in baseball because this is the best team I've ever
played on.''
</P>
<P>
   While names like Moises Alou and Randy Johnson are often
mentioned in discussions of the Astros' success _ and rightfully so
_ another key element in the Astros' franchise-record &UR;  &LR; 102 wins
this season has been the play of Bigwell, er, Bagwell and Biggio.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he has played in the shadows for much of this past
season, Bagwell still piled up stats that most any other player
would envy, batting .304 and hitting 34 homers. He drove in 111
runs, the third straight year he has broken the century mark in
RBIs and the first player in franchise history to do so.
</P>
<P>
   And in this, the Astros' best year of all, Biggio had perhaps
the best year of his career, setting a handful of team records
along the way. Biggio became the first player in franchise history
to collect more than 200 hits, finishing with 210, while cracking a
career-high 51 doubles and swiping 50 bases, another career high.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (season) is fun,'' Biggio said. ``Team-wise, this is the
best team I've ever played on _ without a doubt it's the best team
offensively that I've ever been a part of. Historically the Astros
have always been pitching-oriented _ pitching, pitching, pitching.
Now, all of a sudden, we have an offense going, and that's fun.
It's fun to be part of an offensive team like this. This has been
special.''
</P>
<P>
   And both are enjoying the good times, especially since they can
vividly remember the not-so-good times in the not-so-distant past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost 97 games my first year here, and now we've won 102, so
that road has been a lot of fun,'' said Bagwell, laughing. ``The
team has gone through a big overhaul, which is what most teams do
over an eight-year period, but this is a nice way to finish this
part of the eight years out. We have the best team I've played on,
and we have a great shot at doing some great things (in the
playoffs).''
</P>
<P>
   Biggio, too, his amazed when he looks around the locker room
these days and takes note of all the talent he sees.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got here I was 22 years old and the other guy who
was closest to my age was probably about 32, so there was a big gap
in age,'' Biggio said. ``But at a young age I was able to be around
some people who had a big impact on me. I learned a lot from guys
like that. They taught me a lot about the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the franchise (progressed) from a veteran team like that
to one where we had a whole bunch of rookies, and we learned a lot
about ourselves. And then we went to where we were last year,
winning the division, to where we are now. It's a lot of fun. Right
now, if you're a player in this organization, you have to be pretty
excited about it because you have something here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won the division last year and we did it again, and that's
something you want to keep and keep building on. It's kind of like
what the (Atlanta) Braves did. This is a good time to have an Astro
uniform on.''
</P>
<P>
   One would think so since Houston management got big guns like
Johnson and Alou to supplement an already strong attack. But the
Astros' success has been just as much about Biggio and Bagwell
being the right teammates as it was in finding the right teammates
to put around the two.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if there's one thing that both charter members of the
``Killer Bs'' learned through those first few years is communicated
in what has almost become a mantra for Biggio and Bagwell _ have
fun, respect the game and play the game the way it is supposed to
be played.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I do it is to just go out there and play the game the
way I think it's supposed to be played,'' said Bagwell with a
shrug. I think I play the game the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   They've done most everything the right way.
</P>
<P>
   In a time when free agency and the hunger for more and more
dollars drive many players to wander from team to team, Bagwell and
Biggio have been content to stick around Houston and help the team
grow into a power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we are the only ones left,'' Bagwell said. ``This is a
different club now. We have some good talent in this clubhouse. You
look around and we have Moises Alou, we have Derek Bell, we have
Randy Johnson _ everybody in baseball knows who those guys are. And
we have the rest of the cast as well. Everybody here is a great
player, and it's just a pleasure to be on this club.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggio, of course, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we've been fortunate to have stayed put in one
spot for a long time,'' Biggio said. ``Management wanted us here,
so we were able to stay here. I think that's a big part of it. You
see so many guys move along because of free agency, so for whatever
reason they can't stay with a certain club.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Baggy and I have been very fortunate to be able to stay
here. The organization has been good to us, and the fans have been
good to us. We're just going to go out there and play the game and
respect the game.''

Consistent Bell 
answers critics 
with best year yet
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
When it's least expected, Derek Bell is at his best.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his seven-year career, Bell has been labeled as
streaky for his penchant for fast starts and slow finishes. He's
been booed. He's been the center of trade talks on numerous
occasions the past two years. He was even called ``spacey'' by one
television analyst.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sports Illustrated also selected Bell as baseball's
most underrated player. But in what has become an annual rite of
passage, he was snubbed from the National League All-Star team this
season for the third time despite gaudy numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think of the Astros, you think of Moises Alou, Jeff
Bagwell and Craig Biggio,'' Bell said. ``I just sneak up from
behind like always. Then, some people look at the scoreboard, see
my numbers and say, `Wow, this guy is swinging the bat pretty
good.' I like to sneak up because nobody pays attention to me.''
</P>
<P>
   They are now. The differnce this year is that Bell has finished
what he started.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately _ and without notice _ Bell broke out of the
gate for his quickest start since 1995 and has arguably been the
most consistent Astros player this season.
</P>
<P>
   On March 31, he had four hits in a season-opening loss to the
San Francisco Giants. he batted .413 in the first month of the
season. He had a career-best 14-game hitting streak in June. His
average has not dipped below .300 all season. On Sept. 25 against
Chicago, he hit his career-best 22nd home run.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Bell has established single-season highs for hits (198),
doubles (41), runs (111), homers (22) and walks (51). He has 61
multihit games, including 21 with three or more hits. And on the
few occasions he doesn't produce at the plate, he makes
highlight-reel plays on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been an awesome player. A couple of years ago in 1995 it
was the same thing,'' Astros second baseman Craig Biggio said. ``He
has a lot of tools, a lot of talent and is having a phenomenal
year. Derek has been huge. He's been consistent for us all season
long. He's one of the main reasons we are at the point we are right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell credits father figure and second-year Astros hitting
instructor Tom McCraw for the re-emergence of his consistency and
production at the plate. After watching Bell juggle four different
stances _ sometimes in one at-bat _ last season, McCraw tutored the
29-year-old right fielder on hitting mechanics during the offseason
and spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing was staying with one stance,'' Bell said.
``Coming back and sitting on the bench, sometimes I used to put too
much emphasis on one or two at-bats and not focus on winning the
game. I wanted to win the game so bad that if I didn't hit in a key
situation, I'd let it affect me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now with Mac and (Astros reserve outfielder Dave) Clark on the
bench, they tell me to not even worry about it, that it's over. You
can't rewind, forget about it and move on. If I do it, I do it. If
I don't, I don't. I'm going out there and enjoying myself. That's
turned everything around.''
</P>
<P>
   McCraw made a few recommendations to Bell, including using a
heavier and longer bat, but his biggest influence has been on
Bell's mental approach to hitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him focused more, one batting stance. I want him
comfortable,'' McCraw said. ``If this one works, let's stay with it
no matter what, 0-for-10, we stay with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, I would look across the field and see at least three,
four or five batting stances in one at-bat. My point was he would
never get to know himself if he kept doing that. The big thing was
for Derek to find out what work works and what doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Bell shuffled in and out of the No. 2 spot in the
batting order and never got comfortable. His run production slipped
_ he had only 15 homers and 71 RBIs _ while missing a month of the
season on the disabled list with a hematoma in his left calf.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a playoff swoon Bell and the Astros would like to
forget. The Killer B's _ Biggio, Bagwell, Bell and Sean Berry _
went a combined 2-for-38 as Atlanta swept the Division Series 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not going to get on Bagwell or Biggio, they're
household words,'' McCraw said. ``They are guys that have been
consistent in putting up their numbers. It wasn't that Derek Bell
stunk in the playoffs. We as an offensive unit stunk. That means
Tom McCraw, Biggio, Bagwell and Bell. We all stunk. We all should
have been booed because we all didn't do our job. We didn't get out
there like we can.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took it very personal. He's very sensitive. He busted his
(butt) all year and he got booed. I don't say I disagree. I think
we all should have been booed, me right there leading the bunch. I
should have been booed first and then my players. We stunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Biggio, ``He had some unfair criticism. It's a team game.
You're not going to win or lose because one guy is having a great
year or a bad year. That's not the deciding factor. The deciding
factor is 25 guys playing together. People put blame on one guy
that's a cop out. That's terrible. They should look in the mirror.
For us, he has been solid ever since he's been here.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell said the club's performance in last year's playoffs was not
the motivation for this season, which produced a second straight NL
Central title and a club-record 102 victories. Each year is
different. So is a hitter's consistency at the plate. As Bell
simply attests, some years are better than others.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Bell was among the league leaders in batting average
(.334), but only produced eight home runs and 86 RBIs. The
following season, he produced a career-high 113 RBIs but his
average slipped 61 points to .263.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can say you're going to have a consistent
year, because baseball is a funny game,'' Bell said. ``Once you
think you have it figured out, one of those years come along and
messes you up. You come to find out the only thing you did wrong
was in your head, your thinking process.''
</P>
<P>
   With Biggio having a career year at the leadoff spot, Bagwell
batting behind him in the lineup along with offseason acquisition
Alou, Bell said there is less pressure to produce at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't come through, I know I have guys behind me to pick
me up,'' Bell said. ``At times when I was hitting fourth, Bagwell
and Biggio were in front of me and I knew I had a lot of pressure
on me. If I didn't do it I was putting a whole bunch of pressure on
the guys behind me. So I figured I had to go out there and try too
hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Now) I get a chance to relax, and just go out and swing the
bat and try and get on base.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, Bell is having the best season of his career.
McCraw warns, however, that Bell is still a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Derek Bell has not reached the apex of what his ability is
going to allow him to do. This is just starting up the mountain,''
McCraw said. ``We haven't even gotten to the top to the mountain as
far as his talents are concerned.''

   My aunt, Dorothy Harvey, who is 96, is the last surviving member
of my mother's rather large family. She lives in Michigan and
although age has taken its toll on her body, her mind is sharp and
she is well versed in matters of the day. She is a hidebound
Republican and lets you know it.
</P>
<P>
   I call her regularly and, on occasion, have bantered with her
about the goings-on in the White House. I did so recently, after
the President's famous speech following his grand jury testimony,
and she launched into an expression of her feelings on the matter.
Eventually winding down, she paused briefly, then said slowly,
``But you know, I was never quite sure about Warren Harding.''

   One in a thousand? A million? Eileen Leeds, who lives in
Stamford, Conn., was recently on a Madison Avenue bus en route to
the Museum of the City of New York. As the bus approached the 90s,
most of the passengers had left and Ms. Leeds chatted with the
driver. Several hours later, Ms. Leeds left the museum. It had
started raining, there wasn't a cab in sight and, wet and
miserable, she headed for Lexington Avenue. Where could she find
shelter until the rain eased, she wondered, looking at the nearby
stores. Suddenly and to her great surprise because it wasn't a bus
stop, a Lexington Avenue bus pulled up, stopped and the horn
honked. The doors flew open and a voice cut through the downpour
and said, ``Hop in.'' It was the bus driver she had had on her
original journey. Talk about customer relations!

disaster he might have prevented. He was riding his bike home,
wearing a tie after a tieless casual summer, and stopped for a red
light at Third Avenue and 16th Street. A man, probably in his late
50s, approached him, wearing well-tailored slacks, blue blazer and
crisp shirt, but no tie. ``Would you sell me your tie?'' the man
asked. ``I'll give you $20 for it.'' The exchange was made. Vogel
pedaled off, but not before he saw the man put on the tie and smile
at the well-dressed woman next to him. Vogel pegged the woman's
look as equal parts of awe and disbelief.

he wonders how a postcard sent from the La Jolla Presbyterian
Church in La Jolla, Calif., to a church member who lives on Azul
Street, also in La Jolla, was delivered to him in East Windsor,
N.J., along with his bills, magazines and sweepstakes entry forms.

Hospital when the other phone rang. My sister-in-law answered, then
whispered to the doctor, ``It's St. Francis calling.''

sex.'''

   Monica Lewinsky apparently said that she never wore the infamous
blue dress again because Linda Tripp told her it made her look fat.
That's mostly because the President ejaculates in horizontal
stripes.

<P>
   Yesterday, President Clinton's meeting with the Prime Minister
of Japan was scheduled for 10 minutes, and it lasted for two hours.
Which is interesting because his meetings with Monica Lewinsky were

Tag teams help Astros do double dose of damage
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Astros manager Larry Dierker adds a step to the axiom that says two
heads are better than one.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker believes four arms are better than two. Ditto with the
legs. Which means instead of using one player in a given situation,
Dierker usually has a choice of players to address game-to-game
matchups.
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the reasons Dierker was able to assemble the
Astros' team of the century _ in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the Astros have been able to maintain a consistent
pace en route to 102 victories was depth. Dierker used such
tag-team combinations as Sean Berry and Billy Spiers at third base,
Carl Everett and Richard Hidalgo in center field, Ricky Gutierrez
and Tim Bogar at shortstop and Brad Ausmus and Tony Eusebio at
catcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have good depth on the bench, and we have good depth in the
lineup,'' Dierker said. ``We can score runs at the end of the
lineup and at the beginning of the lineup. We have guys who can hit
the ball out of the park and we have guys who can steal bases, so
we're pretty versatile offensively. We have some guys like Spiers
and Berry, and then Everett and Hidalgo, who can share positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That always gives us a game-fresh guy on the bench. Eusebio
and Ausmus have been a really good combination. I really feel
fortunate as a manager to have as many weapons as I have _ and as
much flexibility in terms of creating a lineup each day.''
</P>
<P>
   Combine that versatility with the everyday contributions from
Jeff Bagwell, Craig Biggio, Derek Bell and Moises Alou, and you
have the makings of an offensive juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lineup can do so many different things, and other teams
are aware of that,'' Everett said. ``That's going to help us out
tremendously. A team has to stay on its toes, and it also puts a
lot of fear into pitchers because they know that from 1 through 9,
you have to pitch to us, even to the pitchers. Our pitchers have
been swinging.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a team we enjoy that and know that we have that advantage.
When we're swinging the bats, we feel that we are going to win
every game.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for that feeling is the addition of Everett, who has
been a revelation in center field. Everett is the type who seems to
squeeze everything out of each hit, driving in 76 runs with his 138
hits. Combine that with Hidalgo's 35 RBIs and you have the kind of
production Dierker has gotten from Alou (124 RBIs), Bagwell (111),
Bell (108) and Biggio (88).
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons the Astros have been successful with Dierker
juggling the lineup is the players made the commitment to see it
work. Everett, who came to Houston from the New York Mets in a
December trade for John Hudek, could have rebelled against
splitting time with a young hotshot like Hidalgo. But he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   And in this day and age of mercenary players landing fat
contracts based on statistics, that attitude is rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a situation where if you have a winning team, the guys
develop a partnership and they really get into it _ what they can
do together,'' Dierker said. ``If you have a losing team, then both
of them (the platooning players) want to play every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we've been winning throughout much of the season, we
haven't really had a lot of problems with chemistry or guys
complaining about not playing enough because everybody's been
playing some and everybody's been enjoying winning.''
</P>
<P>
   To players such as Everett, Berry and company, it comes down to
one thing _ winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have the mentality to win,'' Everett said. ``You
take Baltimore, for instance. They have a great team, but their
total mind-set may be different in the clubhouse because they
haven't played together all year long. They had a stretch after the
All-Star Game when they played together, but before that their
mentality was, `I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But here, from day one, it's been, `Whatever I can do to help
the team.' That's what works for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem for the players is keeping themselves sharp,
physically and mentally. And in a mentally demanding game like
major-league baseball, it can be difficult at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally it's probably the toughest, especially for someone
like myself who has been a starter for a few years and then having
to split time,'' said Berry, who batted .314 with 13 homers and 52
RBIs. ``Mentally that's kind of tough. Otherwise, you just have to
be professional about it. You don't hang your head. You have to go
out and do your job.''
</P>
<P>
   When it all comes together, as it has for the Astros this
season, it can be the makings of a great team with tremendous
potential at playoff time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our deepest team by far,'' Bagwell said. ``We had a
great team in 1994. I think it was almost a coming-out year for a
lot of players. Obviously Ken Caminiti took off and became the
National League MVP (with San Diego), I had a great year that year,
(Biggio) came into his own, so we all started to come out together.
</P>
<P>
   ``But look at the players we have on this club now. There are
some great players here, we have great bench guys and our pitching
depth has been tremendous. It's been a fun, fun team to play on.''

   Versatile mix &QL; 
helps bullpen &QL; 
find success
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
When searching for reasons the Astros compiled a franchise-record
102 victories, it's easy to point to the offense, where guys like
Jeff Bagwell, Craig Biggio, Derek Bell and newcomer Moises Alou
beat up on just about everybody while setting quite a few team
records.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the starting pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Reynolds (19-8, 3.51 ERA) made up for the 19 victories
from the departed Darryl Kile, who bolted for Colorado via free
agency, and Randy Johnson (10-1, 1.28) was all he was advertised to
be after being acquired from Seattle late in the season.
</P>
<P>
   But for one of the main reasons the Astros have been one of the
biggest bullies of the block in the National League, one need look
no further than the bully _ the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   From one of the biggest question marks entering the season,
manager Larry Dierker meticulously built the bullpen into one that
stacks up among the best in the league, compiling a 3.56 ERA in 456
innings.
</P>
<P>
   But even Dierker has a hard time homing in on one or two members
who have really stood out or made a difference over the course of
this record-breaking season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of versatility,'' Dierker said. ``Doug Henry,
he's more of a fly-ball, strikeout guy; Jay Powell is more of a
ground-ball, strikeout guy; Magnante has the screwball, and he can
pitch to lefthanders or righthanders equally well; Trever (Miller)
has been throwing strikes all year, and he's lefthanded and has a
little bit of deception in his delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Scott) Elarton is a starting pitcher who has been coming out
of the bullpen, and he has four pitches he's been able to get over
the plate. Of course, we have (Billy) Wagner, and we don't have to
say much about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of different ways I can go. I don't always pick
the right guy, but all of them have attributes that can help you
either hold the score if you're behind or hold and save the game if
you're ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros were ahead quite a few times while amassing 102
victories and winning the National League Central Division title
for the second straight year.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the year, however, the bullpen _ other than
Wagner _ was one of the team's biggest question marks. But Dierker
put the pieces together, picking up Henry in the offseason from San
Francisco, bringing Elarton up from Class AAA New Orleans and
salvaging Powell from the Florida Marlins' World Championship yard
sale.
</P>
<P>
   The additions gave the Astros depth that few bullpens could
match. Dierker can go with Wagner, Magnante or Miller from the left
side, and Elarton, Henry or Powell from the right side.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get into comparisons, I don't think we were ever as
deep as this bullpen,'' said former Astros catcher Alan Ashby, now
an Astros broadcaster. ``In every instance, we had what I would
consider an oustanding closer. We had Joe Sambito (in 1980), and
then we had Dave Smith (in 1986) and now we have Billy Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all certainly guys who are capable of shutting down an
opponent. Nobody could do it with the strikeout like Wagner can.
But I don't remember the depth in those other bullpens that they
have now, especially when you're talking about guys like Doug Henry
and Jay Powell in particular.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most valuable aspect of the Astros' bullpen is that
there are few truly defined roles. Most of the players, save
Wagner, can be used in a variety of ways _ long relief, short
relief or setup work. That point was hammered home to Elarton when
he came up on June 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really haven't totally figured out my role yet,'' Elarton
said, laughing. ``I've been in save situations, long relief, setup
_ you name it, I've been there. I like getting the experience.''
</P>
<P>
   While the bullpen has been pretty much an equal-opportunity
workplace, Wagner gets most of the attention _ for whatever he
does.
</P>
<P>
   The lefty with the blazing fastball chalked up 30 saves, just
six away from Doug Jones's team record of 36, set in 1992. At one
point in the season he converted 19 straight save opportunities,
and he averaged 14.6 strikeouts per nine innings pitched.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner received just as much notoriety, however, for the line
drive he took off his head on July 15 at Arizona, suffering a
concussion that put him on the disabled list for 15 days.
</P>
<P>
   But Powell and Henry, who have the ability and mentality to
serve as closers, picked up the slack until Wagner came back, just
as good as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that at that time everybody stepped it up a little
bit,'' Wagner said. ``Jay Powell came in and got some big saves,
Doug Henry got some saves, Mike Magnante got some saves. We had
some guys pitching in unfamiliar roles, but they stepped it up,
which shows you how versatile our bullpen has been all year. It's
always been somebody stepping up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bullpen doesn't get a lot of credit because there aren't
really any big names down there. You have Randy Johnson, you have
Biggio, Bagwell and Alou here, so we've been kind of overlooked all
year long. But we've been having guys stepping up, pitching big
innings and getting big outs.''

   My aunt, Dorothy Harvey, who is 96, is the last surviving member
of my mother's rather large family. She lives in Michigan and
although age has taken its toll on her body, her mind is sharp and
she is well versed in matters of the day. She is a hidebound
Republican and lets you know it.
</P>
<P>
   I call her regularly and, on occasion, have bantered with her
about the goings-on in the White House. I did so recently, after
the President's famous speech following his grand jury testimony,
and she launched into an expression of her feelings on the matter.
Eventually winding down, she paused briefly, then said slowly,
``But you know, I was never quite sure about Warren Harding.''

   One in a thousand? A million? Eileen Leeds, who lives in
Stamford, Conn., was recently on a Madison Avenue bus en route to
the Museum of the City of New York. As the bus approached the 90s,
most of the passengers had left and Ms. Leeds chatted with the
driver. Several hours later, Ms. Leeds left the museum. It had
started raining, there wasn't a cab in sight and, wet and
miserable, she headed for Lexington Avenue. Where could she find
shelter until the rain eased, she wondered, looking at the nearby
stores. Suddenly and to her great surprise because it wasn't a bus
stop, a Lexington Avenue bus pulled up, stopped and the horn
honked. The doors flew open and a voice cut through the downpour
and said, ``Hop in.'' It was the bus driver she had had on her
original journey. Talk about customer relations!

   It was one of the last performances of ``Colin Quinn: An Irish
Wake'' at the Helen Hayes Theater. A disgruntled theatergoer,
sitting near Laura Pedersen, returned from the concession area and
complained to seated friends, ``They call this an Irish wake, but
they won't even let you bring a drink to your seat.''

   They didn't need the coming revival of ``On the Town'' to
inspire them _ Sidney Sandler gave his prescription information to
the order taker for the AARP Pharmacy Service in Pennsylvania. He
followed this with his address and ended with ``New York, New
York.'' The following exchange ensued, short but a delight to both
participants.
</P>
<P>
   Order taker: ``It's a hell of a town.''

   My 6-year-old grandniece, Katharine MacComber, following her
parents' example, has become interested in the fat content of food.
One day recently, she and her mother visited my daughter at the
hospital, who was nursing her new son. Katharine had never seen a
mother nursing and was quite taken with the procedure. The
following morning she asked her mother ``Is a mommy's milk 1
percent or skim?''

   Elfin Frederick Vogel is still curious about what social
disaster he might have prevented. He was riding his bike home,
wearing a tie after a tieless casual summer, and stopped for a red
light at Third Avenue and 16th Street. A man, probably in his late
50s, approached him, wearing well-tailored slacks, blue blazer and
crisp shirt, but no tie. ``Would you sell me your tie?'' the man
asked. ``I'll give you $20 for it.'' The exchange was made. Vogel
pedaled off, but not before he saw the man put on the tie and smile
at the well-dressed woman next to him. Vogel pegged the woman's
look as equal parts of awe and disbelief.

   Lawrence H. Zisman understands that there are many mysteries in
life, from how the great pyramids in ancient Egypt were built to
when the universe will end. He even understands that there are more
than occasional mysteries involving the U.S. Postal Service. Still,
he wonders how a postcard sent from the La Jolla Presbyterian
Church in La Jolla, Calif., to a church member who lives on Azul
Street, also in La Jolla, was delivered to him in East Windsor,
N.J., along with his bills, magazines and sweepstakes entry forms.
</P>
<P>
   The card announced the date of a future ministry committee
meeting. Zisman called the California church so it could get in
touch with its parishioner. But he's now philosophizing about the
possible reason behind the rerouting _ could it have been a divine
message to convert to Presbyterianism and move to California? Who
knows?

   Is it possible that the couple Paul Drinkwater saw walking down
the street, each talking on a cell phone, were talking to each

   My sister-in-law was married to a prominent surgeon who
specialized in open-heart surgery. A member of operating teams at
two hospitals in the Chicago area, St. Francis and Christ, he would
operate in the morning and field calls in the evening about his
patients from the resident staffs. One evening during a visit, the
doctor was on the telephone talking to a resident at Christ
Hospital when the other phone rang. My sister-in-law answered, then
whispered to the doctor, ``It's St. Francis calling.''
</P>
<P>
   He whispered back: ``Tell St. Francis I'll have to call back.
I'm talking to Christ.''

   Talk about coincidences. A reader, who for some reason insists
on remaining anonymous, says that he recently wrote a professor at
Arizona State University but couldn't recall its location. He
guessed it was Tempe and went along with that.

<P>
   As he approached the box to mail his letter, a jogger happened
along wearing a sweatshirt emblazoned Arizona State University. He
stopped her, showed her the envelope and asked, ``Is Tempe,
right?'' Yes. she said, and added a lagniappe _ the ZIP code.

   Our good buddy, heavyweight champ Evander Holyfield, admitted

testimony aired on national television. When asked about it, the
President said, 'That was the least fun I ever had talking about
sex.'''
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky apparently said that she never wore the infamous
blue dress again because Linda Tripp told her it made her look fat.
That's mostly because the President ejaculates in horizontal
stripes.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, President Clinton's meeting with the Prime Minister
of Japan was scheduled for 10 minutes, and it lasted for two hours.
Which is interesting because his meetings with Monica Lewinsky were
scheduled for two hours and lasted 10 minutes.

   According to new polls, 75 percent of Americans disagree with
the President's claim that oral sex is not sex. Even more shocking,
50 percent of married people deny that oral sex exists.

   Yesterday, the stopwatch that's been used in the opening of '60

   HURRICANE GEORGES
</P>
<P>
   GEORGES _ OCEAN SPRINGS, Miss. _ The Gulf Coast groaned under
the fury of Hurricane Georges, which moved ashore with gusts as
high as 172 mph early today as it spewed wind and rain from the
Florida Panhandle to Louisiana. New Orleans hoped it had avoided
the worst the storm could offer. No deaths or injuries had been
reported, but National Guard troops using trucks and boats had to
rescue about 200 people from flooded homes in the Florida
Panhandle, where most roads were reported flooded and Interstate 10
was washed out near the Alabama line. The hurricane's eye,
surrounded by wind blowing at a sustained 105 mph, moved ashore
this morning at Ocean Springs, between Biloxi and Pascagoula, and
the National Hurricane Service in Biloxi reported a gust to 172
mph. Within two hours, the wind started rising again at Pascagoula.

VOWS BY THE BOW, TEEN DISCOS AND PIZZA PARTIES PROVE POPULAR ON
BOARD
</HEADLINE>
  (For release on Sunday, Oct. 4.)  
(nk) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Through most of the first eight months of this year, almost
everything seemed to be coming up roses for the cruise industry.
The year-end passenger count is likely to surpass last year's 5.05
million total, and the industry forecast of 7 million passengers by
the year 2000 seemed well on target. Even the arrival in Florida
two days ago of the Grand Princess, the world's biggest cruise
liner, which departs on its initial Caribbean cruise Tuesday, did
not give rise to the usual laments that the industry cannot absorb
so many berths.
</P>
<P>
   But the stock market slide that turned into a plunge on Aug. 31,
and the financial roller-coaster ride that followed, sent the
euphoria packing. For they served as reminders that cruises are
especially vulnerable to penny-pinching during tight economic
times, when many potential passengers opt instead for day trips,
vacations visiting family or friends, or staying home altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Georges caused few canceled cruises in the Caribbean
and the Gulf of Mexico, though a number of cruise lines had to
juggle itineraries, dates and time of departure, even the port of
departure. Barring unforeseen storms, or greater than expected
damage to ports, cruise lines said they expected to be operating on
normal schedules by last week. But they recommend that passengers
who have booked a cruise contact their travel agent, the cruise
line or the line's Web site for any last-minute changes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while widespread optimism about the economic outlook has
been replaced by widespread caution, the industry is reasonably
confident that several national trends and its own innovations will
cushion any but the worst shocks.
</P>
<P>
   For example, while vacations are undeniably susceptible to
economic downturns, more Americans have come to regard them as a
veritable birthright. Americans took 862 million pleasure trips
last year, according to the Travel Industry Association, 43 percent
more than in 1987. And cruises, at an average cost of about $175
per adult per day, including meals and entertainment _ with
children free or at a reduced rate _ compare favorably with resort
hotels, ski vacations or a week or two at the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the popularity of two- to five-day cruises, the
industry's fastest-growing segment, mirrors the national trend
toward shorter, more frequent vacations, to accommodate working
couples. As a result, younger people are increasingly choosing a
cruise for one of those shorter vacations. According to the Cruise
Lines International Association, the percentage of travelers over
60 has dropped to 28 percent this year from 44 percent in 1986 and
the median age has fallen from 52 to 50 in that same period;
Carnival said that for the last decade 35 percent of its 1.7
million passengers have been under 35.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign of cruising's growing popularity among younger
people is that weddings at sea are no longer an anomaly but an
established phenomenon, offered on ships large and small. The Grand
Princess says it has the first chapel at sea, the Hearts and Minds
Wedding Chapel, which seats 36 and can be used for marriages and
renewing vows. Chapels are all but certain on some of the 20 or
more new ships expected to go into service through the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival alone said that it will have married 2,000 couples this
year, during shipboard services on embarkation day in any of its
year-round home ports, plus Vancouver during the summer season.
Also available are on-island ceremonies during port calls in
Catalina Island, San Juan and St. Thomas, as well as shipboard
services while its vessels are docked or anchored at Grand Cayman
and Barbados. To keep up with demand, two months ago Carnival added
on-island ceremonies in Ocho Rios, Jamaica; Key West, Fla. (at a
private beach); and Nassau, the Bahamas (in a flower-covered gazebo
at the Radisson Beach Hotel or on an adjacent private beach).
</P>
<P>
   Wedding packages average about $500 but can easily cost $1,500,
depending on options. Most are likely to include an official civil
ceremony, flowers, champagne, photographs, wedding cake and
transportation to and from the island location. Most also include
prerecorded wedding music, but American Hawaii's packages include
live ukulele music, as well as flower leis and a floral headpiece
for the bride.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the people getting married on ships are getting
married for the second time, and just don't want to spend a fortune
on another wedding,'' said Shaunah Majcher, vice president of Royal
Pacific Occasions, a Vancouver company that coordinates weddings
throughout the world for Holland America. One of its more unusual
wedding sites, Ms. Majcher said, is atop Herbert Glacier, a short
helicopter flight from Juneau, Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise weddings vary with cruise line, although the lines
require that bride and bridegroom sail on the cruise. Also,
according to Ms. Majcher, on most ships captains do not perform
wedding ceremonies, couples cannot usually be married while at sea,
and most wedding ceremonies are civil rather than religious.
</P>
<P>
   Children are another growing cruise sector. The industry puts
their numbers at only 15 percent, but in the case of Carnival, the
industry leader, that is expected to translate into about 200,000
children this year. And the percentage of children is obviously far
higher during school vacations and on Disney Cruise Line, which was
designed with families in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the fate of the all-family ship American Adventure, which
folded in 1994 after nine months of operation, industry officials
still question the wisdom of an all-family ship or cruise line,
except for Disney, whose cruises are sold as part of a land-sea
package with Disney World. But they consider family cruises with
children an important untapped market.
</P>
<P>
   That is why this year Princess lowered from 12 months to 6
months the age at which children can accompany their parents or
guardians to the Caribbean and Alaska. That is also why, during
holidays or in the summer, most ships have a range of programs for
kids 2 to 17, as well as trained counselors, baby sitters,
children's menus, toddler's play areas, teen clubs, wading pools,
karaoke contests and pizza parties. Premier's Big Red Boat not only
has Looney Tunes characters aboard but also serves Bugs
Bunny-shaped waffles for breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   All Carnival ships have a children's wading pool, while its
Celebration and Ecstasy have water slides for children who can swim
and are at least 3 feet 10 inches. The Grand Princess not only has
two-level children's and teen centers, for teen-agers it also has a
disco, Jacuzzi and a motion-based simulator that provides a variety
of thrill rides.
</P>
<P>
   One of the newest trends afloat is educational activities for
children, including Hawaiian language and hula lessons on American
Hawaii Cruises, Italian language lessons on Costa Cruise Lines and
learning the art of clowning aboard Norwegian Cruise Line. Royal
Caribbean has a video arcade as well as children's books in the
ship library and movies for children on cabin televisions. On
Celebrity Cruises, children can participate in summer stock
theater, from operating lighting equipment to performing in shows.
</P>
<P>
   Activities for adults are on the rise, too. Theme cruises, which
Norwegian Cruise Line claims to have pioneered in the early 1980s,
continue to grow in number and popularity. Norwegian is offering
its 16th annual Floating Jazz Festival on two weeklong Caribbean
cruises aboard the Norway departing Miami on Oct. 24 and Oct. 31;
other sailings will feature country music (Nov. 14), big bands
(Nov. 21) and blues (Dec. 12).
</P>
<P>
   Holland America's Westerdam will operate 22 seven-day theme
cruises this fall and next year from Fort Lauderdale to the eastern
Caribbean. These include a tribute to Frank Sinatra departing Dec.
12 (Sinatra's birthday), and big bands Nov. 14 and 21, Jan. 9 and
March 6. The Oct. 24 departure will celebrate Oktoberfest, with
beer tastings and oompah and polka music. Bingo's the game on the
Nov. 7, Jan. 2 and March 27 cruises, and the Super Bowl will be
broadcast live on Jan. 31. That cruise will feature Pro Bowl and
Hall of Fame football players.
</P>
<P>
   American Hawaii Cruises' Independence will have marine
naturalists aboard all 14 seven-day round-trip whale-watching
cruises departing Honolulu every Saturday from Jan. 2 through April
3.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal Cruises themes will range from the cerebral to the
gustatory. Writers, artists and editors of The New Yorker magazine
will appear on each segment of the Crystal Symphony's 99-day voyage
from Los Angeles to Lisbon, beginning Jan. 18. And all eight 12-day
San Francisco to Alaska cruises next summer will feature ``great
chefs of San Francisco.'' Royal Olympic's Stella Solaris will
celebrate theater and cabaret on its 13-day cruise departing from
Rio de Janeiro to Manaus, Brazil, and on its 13-day cruise
departing from Manaus to Fort Lauderdale. The Royal Viking Sun will
offer a murder mystery cruise during its 14-day crossing (May 21)
from Miami to Barcelona in which passengers act the role of sleuth
and try to collar a killer on the loose among them.
</P>
<P>
   Radisson Seven Seas Cruises is offering six golf cruises through
February, during which passengers can play on two to four golf
courses per cruise. The first, departing Oct. 15 for 10 days, sails
from Rome to Madeira. The Nov. 23 cruise is seven-nights round trip
to and from San Juan, Puerto Rico; Nov. 30, seven nights from San
Juan to Puerto Limon, Costa Rica; Dec. 7, eight nights from Puerto
Limon to Fort Lauderdale; Jan. 17, nine nights from Puerto Caldera,
Costa Rica, to Fort Lauderdale, and Feb. 2, 10 nights from Fort
Lauderdale to Puerto Caldera.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the popularity of theme cruises, according to
James G. Godsman, president of Cruise Lines International
Association, is that they they can fit into busy schedules and
``give vacationers the chance to try a new hobby or rekindle
interest in an old one, against a backdrop of ever-changing
destinations.''
</P>
<P>
   The cruise industry is expanding to new ports of call _ adding
variety to itineraries _ and to new home ports. Holland America
will use San Diego as a home port for the first time in 1999, when
the Statendam makes five 16-day round trips to Hawaii, the first
two of which depart March 29 and April 14. After four years, its
Nieuw Amsterdam will return to Tampa, Fla., in December 1999 for a
series of five 14-day cruises to the southern Caribbean, plus two
seven-day holiday cruises. Carnival's Sensation, now sailing to the
eastern Caribbean from Miami, will relocate to Tampa this December
for weekly western Caribbean cruises, beginning Dec. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival, with the biggest fleet in the industry (12 ships
currently, with two more scheduled for delivery next year), will be
busy on several new fronts in 1999. Its Fascination will operate
from Newport News, Va., and Charleston, S.C., with a mix of
one-night Cruises to Nowhere and Bahamas trips. Next fall,
Carnival's Inspiration will sail a somewhat similar itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, the Fascination and Inspiration can each carry
2,040-passengers, suggesting that Carnival has high expectations
for them in their new surroundings. When Carnival returns to New
York next summer, for its first sailings from the city in five
years, it will do so with the Triumph, set for delivery in
mid-July. At 2,758 passengers and 102,000 tons, it will be the
biggest cruise ship ever to operate from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise ships are vulnerable not only to economic swings but to
safety failures as well, despite the industry's exemplary safety
record. A survey last June by Wirthlin Worldwide, a research and
consulting company in McLean, Va., found that 14 percent of
Americans in a nationwide telephone poll of a thousand adults said
they intended to spend at least one night on a cruise ship during
the coming year. But that plummeted to 7 percent the next month,
following the fire aboard the Carnival Ecstasy shortly after it
left Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Political change has affected the Wind Star, which will be
repositioned in November from the Mediterranean to Costa Rica
instead of Southeast Asia as planned. It had been scheduled to
operate for five months in Indonesia, according to Richard D.
Meadows, vice president of marketing and sales for Windstar
Cruises, but unrest in the region _ prompting State Department
travel advisories _ hampered the company's ability to market the
cruises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Indonesian itineraries from Bali to Singapore were an
integral part of our year-round Southeast Asia program,'' Meadows
added. ``Without these itineraries we think it will be difficult to
operate profitably in Southeast Asia on a year-round basis and have
decided to move the ship in a different direction.''

A SHIP'S POSITION CAN MEAN DEAL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 4) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Travelers who shop for cruises carefully eventually recognize
that in spring and fall, some ships break out of their usual
routes. That's when the cruise lines offer ``positioning'' cruises:
The ships move to new waters for the next season, and there are
deals to be found.
</P>
<P>
   The sailings of Crystal Cruises are expensive by any standard,
but the line lists 8 to 10 of the 60 annual trips by its two ships
in a separate catalog called the Value Collection, where the prices
break down to lower daily rates.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these are positioning cruises. At Crystal, where
officials put the average daily per-person cost for two in a cabin
at $350 to $400, an 11-day Pacific positioning cruise can be bought
for a price that works out to $226 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Many cruise companies offer positioning cruises _ not often by
that name, because, as one agent said, it sounds like a fire sale.
Companies with year-round four- and five-day cruises on a single
route, with daily costs of $100 to $150, have no occasion to offer
positioning cruises. It's the lines with longer routes and more
expensive trips that offer them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not bargains, but good values'' was how Cheryl Santos, an
agent at Cruises Inc. in Syracuse, N.Y., described them.
``Well-traveled clients ask for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The trips are frequently available in March or April, and
September or October. Vessels in Alaska move down the coast and
through the Panama Canal and those in the Mediterranean cross the
Atlantic to ply the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   An obvious fact is that you cannot park your car on the pier:
You'll be debarking in another part of the world. A corollary is
that you have a chance to stay awhile afterward in a different
place.
</P>
<P>
   Positioning cruises are usually longer than others on the same
ship, and crossing oceans means more days at sea than on five-or
seven-day cruises among islands where landfalls are made almost
daily. There's lots to do aboard, passengers agree, but this is a
treat for those who are at ease spending many consecutive days out
of sight of solid ground.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Sagevick, director of reservations at Travel Clearinghouse
in Bay Shore, N.Y., a wholesaler for travel agency consortiums,
said that positioning cruises appealed to experienced cruisers
looking for long trips touching on new or possibly exotic ports, at
a better price.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sagevick's parents took a Princess positioning cruise from
Buenos Aires. It went up the Atlantic coast of South America,
across the Atlantic to West Africa and on to Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents do not book with their daughter but merely consult
her, she said, and then go out seeking good prices. They get
two-for-one deals on positioning cruises and are often upgraded to
a better cabin than they select.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart T. Chiron, vice president for corporate sales at the
Cruise Line, a big agency in Miami Beach, said he took a
positioning cruise on Royal Caribbean's Rhapsody of the Seas in
April, sailing among the Hawaiian Islands and then crossing the
Pacific to Vancouver. He spent 11 nights on the ship, 5 of them at
sea.
</P>
<P>
   The brochure price on this trip was $2,599 for each of two
passengers in an ``M'' category cabin _ five steps from the
cheapest _ he said, and air fare from Dallas to Honolulu and
Vancouver to Dallas was $549. Closer to departure time, because
Royal Caribbean uses yield-management methods and adjusts prices to
bolster lagging sales, the cruise-only price dropped to $1,349 _
about $123 a day _ and the air fare to $99, which meant that the
cruise line was all but underwriting the air portion. (Royal
Caribbean is in the middle price range.)
</P>
<P>
   These prices are no secret: Agents and cruise lines that want to
fill the berths will tell anyone who asks. Frequently, agencies
reserve blocks of cabins and if the price drops, they will adjust
for those who have already made deposits.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron said he particularly enjoyed the afternoon art auctions
at sea _ now common on many cruises, he said. He put the average
passenger age at 57 or 58, plus only a couple of kids, ``a nice
mix.'' A 40-degree drop in the air temperature, down to 48 degrees,
after the ship left the Hawaiian Islands was a shock to some, he
said, and a double wardrobe, or lots of layers, is probably
required for a positioning cruise.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A similar Royal Caribbean trip scheduled for April 27 next year
is listed in the brochure, with the per-person price in same cabin
category at $2,454, with air fare of $629. The ``promotional''
cruise-only price at this writing was $1,554 _ $141 a day _
although the air fare had not changed.
</P>
<P>
   For comparison, the promotional price in the same category for
seven-day sailings in Alaska works out to $182 a day, and for the
Caribbean, at $162 day, making the longer cruise the better value.
</P>
<P>
   On Silversea Cruises, which has top prices that include liquor
and tips, sailings never end in the port of departure, said its
spokeswoman, Jennifer Lawrence Schott, so it's hard to spot a
positioning cruise by its itinerary. Ms. Schott considers it
positioning when the Silver Cloud and the Silver Wind shift from
one part of the world to another.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schott cited a 16-day Silver Cloud trip from Bombay to
Athens. This trip, from April 6 to 22 next year, costs a minimum of
$9,595 for each of two people in a cabin, air fare included. There
is a credit of $1,400 a person if the air connections are not
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schott said Silversea's average per-day cost is $850, and
this positioning cruise comes in at $600.
</P>
<P>
   Silversea does not revise fares on the basis of sales, Ms.
Schott said, but provides 15 percent discounts for purchases six
months in advance and lesser discounts for money commitments four
and three months ahead. It also offers discounts for repeat
clients.
</P>
<P>
   When Crystal Cruises positions its Crystal Harmony for a
Christmas cruise _ these are premium-priced trips at almost all
companies _ the ship travels from Auckland, New Zealand, to
Honolulu in 11 days, arriving Dec. 21. This trip's starting price
of $2,485 for each of two people in an inside cabin is down $500
from the price given in the special catalog, according to Mimi
Weisband, a spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   This is roughly two-thirds the price of $3,515 for an 11-day
cruise on the same vessel between Auckland and Sydney. The
additional air fare, out to Auckland and back from Honolulu, is
$899. If one wanted to stay a little longer in Hawaii before flying
home, there might be a surcharge on the air fare, she said.
</P>
<P>
   On the Pacific cruise, calls are made at Tonga, Western Samoa
and Kailua, Hawaii, but the bulk of the time is spent at sea.
</P>
<P>
   What's there to do? Ms. Weisband said that guest chefs, golf
pros and the like helped to pass the time, but that the computer
classes were a major attraction. ``We have e-mail facilities,'' she
said, ``and the grandchildren get a lot of reports from the
Pacific.''

   HURRICANE GEORGES
</P>
<P>
   GEORGES _ OCEAN SPRINGS, Miss. _ The Gulf Coast groaned under
the fury of Hurricane Georges, which moved ashore with gusts as
high as 172 mph early today as it spewed wind and rain from the
Florida Panhandle to Louisiana. New Orleans hoped it had avoided
the worst the storm could offer. No deaths or injuries had been
reported, but National Guard troops using trucks and boats had to
rescue about 200 people from flooded homes in the Florida
Panhandle, where most roads were reported flooded and Interstate 10
was washed out near the Alabama line. The hurricane's eye,
surrounded by wind blowing at a sustained 105 mph, moved ashore
this morning at Ocean Springs, between Biloxi and Pascagoula, and
the National Hurricane Service in Biloxi reported a gust to 172
mph. Within two hours, the wind started rising again at Pascagoula.

Talented Alou's 
clutch hitting 
bolsters lineup
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Astros manager Larry Dierker was walking off the field following a
spring training game in mid-March when Montreal manager Felipe Alou
approached with one small request for the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take care of my boy,'' Alou said, referring to his son, Moises
Alou, an offseason acquisition by the Astros from the Florida
Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker responded, ``I think he'll take care of us.''
</P>
<P>
   For Alou, the locale has changed, the results have not. Alou's
success is contagious; the left fielder has been part of successful
clubs with Montreal, Florida and now in his first season with
Houston, which wrapped up a second straight National League Central
title.
</P>
<P>
   No one is surprised at the Astros' success this season,
including the 32-year-old Alou, who considers himself another piece
to what was a playoff-contending club upon his arrival.
</P>
<P>
   The facts _ and stats _ say otherwise. The Astros may have been
good without Alou, but they're even better with him. No offseason
acquisition, with the possible exception of Boston's Pedro
Martinez, has done more for a club in such a short amount of time.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost as if Alou never ended last season, picking up where
he left off by rewriting offensive career highs that stood for less
than 11 months. He was within three home runs of last year's 23 by
midseason and finished with 38. His 124 runs batted in are nine
more than last year. His 182 hits are a career best, as are his 34
doubles, 340 total bases, 104 runs and 84 walks.
</P>
<P>
   The one number that means the most, though, is 159, as in games
played. The oft-injured Alou missed the entire 1991 season after
rotator-cuff surgery and never played in 150 games during a season
until last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been healthy, that's the one thing that was tough for me
to do early in my career,'' Alou said.
</P>
<P>
   When he sees considerable playing time, there is no question
Alou gives his team another option on offense and defense _ and
provides another nightmare for the opposition. That explains why
the Astros wasted little time in acquiring Alou, who was the first
to go in Florida's offseason salary purge that disassembled the
defending world champions piece by piece.
</P>
<P>
   Astros reliever Jay Powell, who played with Alou last season,
knew it was the beginning of the end in South Florida when the
Marlins parted ways with the one player ``the club could not
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along that he's the best clutch player I've ever
played with,'' Powell said. ``To see him last year in the World
Series and what he did, it's great to have him on your side. I
would have hated to see where we would have been last season if we
didn't have Moises Alou. We wouldn't have been in the playoffs. It
wouldn't have even been close.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw him get traded last year, we all knew it was over.
That was the one guy we couldn't lose. Anybody else, we had pretty
good replacements for and could get around it. But we couldn't lose
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``As good as the Astros were without Moises last year, you just
see kind of what he adds to the lineup to have one of the best run
producers in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou, named to his third All-Star team in July, has been a
strong complement to a top half of the batting order consisting of
Craig Biggio, Derek Bell and Jeff Bagwell. He started the season on
a tear the first four months but has since cooled off, although his
.312 batting average is the second-highest of his seven-year
career.
</P>
<P>
   With 18 homers coming after the break and the Astros in first
place in the NL Central since April 29, Alou's name quickly
surfaced along with Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and Greg Vaughn as NL
MVP candidates.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't give it a second thought. The Astros' club-record 102
wins told him everything he needed to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I look at myself in the mirror I know what I've
done,'' said Alou, who many considered last year's World Series MVP
after hitting .321 with three home runs in the Marlins' seven-game
triumph over Cleveland. ``I know how important I am to this team. I
know where this team would be without me, or the same thing without
Craig, Bagwell, Bell, Billy Wagner, Mike Hampton or Shane Reynolds.
It's hard for me to look at personal accomplishments. I like to see
what would a team be without somebody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been big on awards. I never play for an award. As a
matter of fact, I never set goals. The only goal I always set is I
want to be healthy the whole year. I want to play as many games as
I can and everything else will take care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou recalls a conversation with his father in late 1996 when he
signed the first lucrative contract _ five years, $25 million with
Florida _ of his career. His father told him to earn his money. All
he did was go out and bring the first World Series title to his
family, whose name has become synonymous with baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that a lot of people know what I'm doing, what I've
brought to this team,'' he said. ``I know that my father knows.
That would probably mean a lot more to me than if I get an award. I
don't want to sound like this, but what my father knows, thinks or
sees what I'm doing that really makes me feel better than any kind
of award.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou said this year's Astros are similar in many ways to the
Marlins club that entered as the wild card in 1997 before their
Cinderella ride through the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly feel that this team is as good. I don't think we
have any holes,'' Alou said. ``We're very deep. We have a good
bullpen. Our offense here is probably as good _ that's one thing
that I would say is probably as good or even better than our
offense last year in Miami. We run the bases well.''
</P>
<P>
   But the main ingredient to a champion, he says, doesn't
necessarily have to do with how many home runs a team hits, how
many runs they score or what a pitcher does on any given start.
It's all about chemistry. The Marlins had it, and Alou is beginning
to see the same with the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I really noticed last year was every day that
went by at the end of the regular season, at the beginning of the
playoffs and the second round was that we became so close,'' Alou
said. ``We were like a family. I think we're improving a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not there yet like I felt we were in Florida. I remember
you would see 20 of us out one night, 15 of us having lunch
together. Half of the team would be in the back of the plane. It's
happening here. We still have a few weeks to go.''

INDIANS POSTED FORMIDABLE RECORD DURING SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's high time to recognize the Cleveland Indians for becoming
only the seventh major league team to lead a division or league
from Opening Day to the end.
</P>
<P>
   Keep that accomplishment in mind as they begin the postseason
against the Red Sox Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   True, Boston had an 8-3 record against the Indians this season,
winning five of six at Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   And true, in winning the American League's Central Division for
the fourth straight year, Cleveland has coasted into the playoffs
against the weakest of the weak.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact remains that the Indians are the defending AL
champions and a formidable obstacle for the Red Sox or anyone else
who steps in their path.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our fourth straight year in the playoffs,'' said
general manager John Hart. ``In 1995, we clearly were the best
team. We beat Boston and Seattle and went to the World Series but
lost to Atlanta. We had 100 wins in a much shorter season (144
games, because of the strike).
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1996, we won 99 and were knocked out in the first round by
Baltimore. Last year we were the fourth-best team in our league and
still wound up in the World Series again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability to sustain success over a period of years is quite
an accomplishment. We've got a good ball club and are anxious to
take another run at the postseason.''
</P>
<P>
   What does all this success tell Hart?
</P>
<P>
   ``What it shows me is that if you have the talent and your club
is playing well in a short series, you've got as good a chance to
win as anybody,'' he said. ``Next to the Yankees, the Indians and
Red Sox had very good years. The most important thing is that we're
all capable of winning. You can take your records and throw them
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians haven't had the same kind of decade as the Braves,
who have made the postseason seven straight years. The mighty
Oakland A's of the early '70s made it five times, winning three
straight World Series (1972-74) while they were at it. But
Cleveland's turnaround has been astounding. As recently as 1993,
the Indians were a sixth-place club (76-86) with seemingly no
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew back in 1992 that what we needed to do was send a
message to our fans that we were serious,'' said Hart. ``Cleveland
had been a revolving door for years. We wanted to fix our payroll.
We wanted to bring back the fans. We needed a new ballpark. We were
able to do all of this, and it was good for the franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first steps was signing star players such as Carlos
Baerga, Albert Belle, Sandy Alomar, Jim Thome, and Kenny Lofton to
long-term deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year presents different challenges,'' said Hart. ``We
tried to retain our star-quality ballplayers, if at all possible,
but we haven't been afraid to do contracts. Through it all, we
still have a very good club.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in place of Belle, who left for the White Sox, the Indians
have Manny Ramirez, who at age 26 has emerged as a prime-time power
hitter. He finished with 45 home runs and 145 runs batted in _
production that was particularly crucial when Thome missed more
than a month after breaking his hand Aug. 7. David Justice and
Alomar were on opposite sides in the 1995 Series, when Atlanta
spoiled Cleveland's first postseason bid of the decade. Now Justice
is an Indian.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans such as Thome, Omar Vizquel, and Charles Nagy are
hungry to erase the memory of last year's heartbreaking World
Series loss to the expansion Florida Marlins, when then closer Jose
Mesa couldn't hold a lead in the ninth inning of Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get as close as we did last year, that feeling never
leaves you,'' said manager Mike Hargrove, who is 624-526 since
taking over in July 1991. ``It was not a fun season. It would be
nice to get back there and win the thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize very few of us are fortunate to be able to get a
chance to do that. Still, we feel like we have as good a chance as
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove, who stands third behind Atlanta's Bobby Cox and
Minnesota's Tom Kelly in managerial seniority, is puzzled by the
reaction his club gets outside Ohio. The Tribe started 6-0 and
never looked back, topping the Central with a 29-19 rec-ord in
division play.
</P>
<P>
   But few people seem to appreciate this, Hargrove has noticed.
And the manager is frustrated that his team is seen as the winner
of the Cupcake Division.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``People are still saying this ball club should be 40 games
over .500,'' said Hargrove. ``Or that we're coasting or cruising.
Those types of observations are so silly that it's obvious that
people who think like this have never been in a situation like this
and have no idea what it takes to sustain something like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know many contending ball clubs that have two rookies
in the rotation and that have lost a Jim Thome for a month. There
have been inconsistencies, to be sure. But we've played well.
Charles Nagy and Dwight Gooden are better now than they were in the
first half. It wasn't a tough time keeping the team on track as
much as it was keeping key players in the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most clubs, the Indians have made some changes along the
way. Gone are high-profile pitchers Orel Hershiser and Mesa, plus
center fielder Marquis Grissom and third baseman Matt Williams, the
latter dealt to Arizona for Travis Fryman. As for Grissom, he
hadn't quite filled the role of Lofton, and after his departure,
Lofton returned as a free agent and took his place.
</P>
<P>
   Another trade brought veteran Dave Burba to join a pitching
staff that included free agent Gooden and holdovers Jaret Wright
and Bartolo Colon, both of whom started the season with less than a
year of major league service. Burba won 15 games, Colon 14, and
Wright 12. Nagy checked in with a 15-10 record. When the Indians
could somehow get to new closer Mike Jackson (40 saves), the world
was all right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitching in a short series is always a factor you must
consider,'' said Hart. ``The key in the Seattle series in 1995 was
a dominant pitcher named Randy Johnson, whom we beat. Baltimore
beat us using (David) `Boomer' Wells twice in 1996. Boston has the
dominant starter in Pedro Martinez. We have to be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's offense was expected to lean heavily on veterans
Thome, Justice, Vizquel, and Alomar. Nobody expected the production
that came from Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   ``In hindsight,'' said Hart, ``I don't think it should come as a
surprise. Everybody around has been waiting to see it.
Historically, he's been a good performer that has put up good
numbers. If anything, he was victimized because he played in a
lineup that had Belle, Lofton, Justice, and a lot of other good
players. Manny was able to hide in 1997 (26 homers, 88 RBIs). But
in 1998, he's continued to step up and put up big numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Off the field, Ramirez does not do much to bring attention to
himself. A native of the Dominican Republic who grew up in
Brooklyn, he is polite but shy around the media, rarely doing
interviews. But some think he could be the next Sammy Sosa. When
Belle was 26, he had 70 career home runs. Sosa had 131. Ramirez has
154. He will get better.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we asked Manny to hit No. 4,'' said Hargrove, ``I can't
emphasize how big it was for us. Without him doing what he did _
with Thome gone _ I think we're still scrambling to win this
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Cleveland's changes have gone smoothly. With Thome
out, the Indians signed Cecil Fielder, who had been released by the
Anaheim Angels, on Aug. 13. After hitting just .143 in 13 games, he
was cut loose. Cleveland decided its chances would be better with
rookie Richie Sexson, who hit .310. It appears to have been a wise
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that doesn't make it any less painful,'' said Hargrove.
``We brought in Cecil thinking he would get a lot of at-bats.
Sexson showed up and took off, and we never had a chance go to that
route. I still think Cecil can play and help some club. Sexson
stepped up big time for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Second base appeared to be a trouble spot for Cleveland until a
trade brought in Joey Cora from Seattle. Now with Cora, Lofton, and
Vizquel, Cleveland has speed to burn. The defense has improved, and
Cora has playoff experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joey has been good for us,'' said Hargrove. ``He came over as
being an offensive second baseman. Not home runs, but a guy who was
a heads-up, aggressive baserunner, a guy who could put the ball in
play from both sides of the plate. He has not disappointed us at
all. He is a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   With the playoffs here, pitching matchups are the subject of
debate. The Indians plan to use four starters, with Wright getting
the nod in Game 1 today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Jaret and Bartolo are coming on now,'' said Hargrove.
``Nagy has been absolutely golden for us his last six or seven
starts. In past years, our bullpen has been the backbone of our
pitching staff. This year it has kind of turned around. Our
starting pitching has been the strength of our pitching staff this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, the Indians have a chance in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Series is everybody's goal,'' said Alomar. ``That's
the reason you play 162 games _ to put yourself in that position.
We know we have the ability to be there. We have a tough road
ahead. They're all good teams, and it's going to be a battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always one or two teams who give you problems during
the year. Boston is one of them. It doesn't mean that it will be
the same way in the postseason.''

and Washington's agenda, dominated by scandal, seems inert, K
Street's portfolio has never been more robust. The influence

DUQUETTE VIEWS '98 SEASON WITH GREAT SATISFACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ ``Mr. Duquette,'' a worker at Fenway Park said, ``I
think you might need some work on that ... '' And then the man
reenacted Duquette's ``Raise the roof'' gesture of the previous
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I was just practicing,'' said Dan Duquette with a big
laugh. ``That's all ... just practicing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how you do it ... '' and then the worker raised both
hands, palms up, toward the ceiling and raised them energetically.
With a bit more energy than Duquette had done.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Duquette was in the virtually-empty executive dining room at
Fenway Park last Friday night, talking about the Red Sox season,
his season, and how the two intertwined, when this tableau
unfolded. Spirits still were high from the previous night, when the
Red Sox clinched a playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``People critiqued my `raising the roof' and they tell me I need
more practice at it,'' said the Red Sox general manager in humorous
self-deprecation. ``I tell them I was just practicing. Hopefully
I'll get it right for the ALCS and the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   If the most memorable scene from three years ago when the Red
Sox clinched their playoff berth was Mo Vaughn and pals riding
Boston police horses, the scene from last Thursday night that might
be recalled most was Duquette up in his private box behind home
plate at Fenway Park. The TV cameras caught Duquette at game's end,
doing the stiff white executive's weak attempt at the latest mantra
of athletes and fans _ the noise-raising `Raise the Roof' entreaty
to fans.
</P>
<P>
   Little can be better than when the Red Sox clinched. Former
Baltimore and Milwaukee GM Harry Dalton, Duquette's mentor, was in
Duquette's private box behind home plate, Dalton coming in at
Duquette's invitation (as part of a magazine story about mentors
and mentoring) to see the final joyous exclamation point to a
surprising season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry took a personal interest in me and helped me develop the
skills that served me well on the job,'' said Duquette. ``It was
nice for him to be here on the day we clinched the playoff spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette was pressed on the point, about how much satisfaction
he took in having his team clinch a playoff berth in front of the
man who gave him his first job 17 years ago, as a lowly scout in
the Milwaukee system. Especially since no one of a sound baseball
mind picked the Red Sox to be in that position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, people didn't pick us in '95, either,'' Duquette
answered. ``But we put together a good ball club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry gave me an opportunity at the entry level of baseball
... and excellent training. It was nice that Harry was here to
experience that (clinching) game.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed some more about the satisfaction he feels _ Duquette is
most reluctant, it seems, to publicly express his personal
feelings, except obliquely _ the GM replied, ``Well, it's fun to
have a good team. But what we really need to do is advance in the
playoffs and accomplish the ultimate goal (World Series). Making
the playoffs is nice, but we hope to do better than that. We need
to do better than that in Boston. We'd like to win the World
Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the good memories from 1998, Duquette was asked his
favorites. What memories will cling to his mind years from now?
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro Martinez's first start here this year against Seattle,
where he dominated their lineup,'' were the first words from
Duquette's mouth. ``That's because that was his first start before
the home fans. That was a great moment. And the classic game in
which Pedro beat (Cleveland's) Bartolo Colon, 1-0, here.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Duquette talked of Bret Saberhagen's comeback (``That's
been a great story''), and Tom Gordon's near-perfection as a closer
and Nomar Garciaparra's play at shortstop and how Tim Wakefield and
Steve Avery helped the starting rotation and how Darren Lewis has
been so good in the outfield, and on and on. ``Lewis is a Gold
Glove center fielder,'' said Duquette, ``and he developed as a
hitter under the tutelage of Jim Rice. Lewis was a good sign for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   And Duquette went on about he was never concerned about all the
critics carping in spring training that Boston's outfield had no
power (``Troy O'Leary's knocked in 80 runs a year for us the last
few years'') and how the platoon of Darren Bragg and Damon Buford
in right field ``has knocked in almost 100 runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes, Mo Vaughn's name did come up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a star first baseman, too,'' said Duquette.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It was one of those sweet coincidences of life. On the night
after the Red Sox clinched, all fans who came to Fenway Park were
given a Red Sox calendar with next year's schedule on it. More than
a few fans flipped the calendar ahead to next April to see whom the
Red Sox will play on Opening Day. They were greeted with a giant
color photo of Vaughn as the April poster boy.
</P>
<P>
   Dan?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in there,'' said Duquette with a laugh when asked about
the calendar. And then he repeated the words, not making the same
snub he did in July, when he omitted Vaughn's name while announcing
the 1999 All-Star Game will be at Fenway Park and what Red Sox
players might be there. ``He's in there ... he's in there ... he's
in there.''
</P>
<P>
   But Vaughn's picture is there in April, when the 1999 season
will open?
</P>
<P>
   ``We put him in the middle there, especially for the Globe,''
said Duquette. ``He's in there.''
</P>
<P>
   (Interestingly, of course, ``he'' refers to Mo Vaughn. Duquette
did not name Vaughn by name.)
</P>
<P>
   As seems much too clear, Duquette and Vaughn and the Red Sox are
in the final moments of a situation all have created that will lead
to Vaughn testing the free agent waters. This situation seems
remarkably reminiscent of how Roger Clemens left Boston, the Red
Sox slamming the door behind him as he left.
</P>
<P>
   The best hitter on a playoff team perhaps leaving soon? Player
after player on the Red Sox tied up and signed by Duquette to
long-term contracts, but not Vaughn? Is this an odd situation, Dan?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, not really,'' replied Duquette. ``We'll be trying to
make an effort to sign him beyond the season, but he's elected to
play out his contract. And that's his right. But to his credit, he
has been focused on the goals of the team. And he's been ready and
available to play every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The impasse over Vaughn's contract was not the only
controversial side to Duquette's year of accomplishment. The GM
also surprised many by shaking up the farm system in midseason,
unusual by its timing. Duquette's critics felt that shakeup was
caused by Duquette's perception that his underlings were not
deflecting all credit for success to the top man in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt that in order to accomplish our goals, we needed
to make a few changes so that we could continue to develop top
quality players for the major league team,'' is how Duquette
explained the moves. ``And that was the time to do it ... right
toward the end of the season. That's when you're preparing your
players and training your staff for the following year.''
</P>
<P>
   The farm system, ``has come along in terms of depth and if you
remember, we used our farm system to trade for Martinez,'' Duquette
added. ``And we also used our farm system to trade for Mike
Stanley, to bring him back. And we used it to reinforce our
pitching staff with the addition of (Greg) Swindell down the
stretch. It's been very helpful in putting together a productive,
and interesting, major league team.''
</P>
<P>
   But did the Red Sox sacrifice some of the future?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Duquette readily acknowledged. ``That's what you do
when you're in a pennant race. You give up players who can help you
in the future for players who can help you now. You owe it to the
team and you owe it to the fans to help you get over the top. But
we still have some depth in our farm system.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Dan Duquette was asked to toot his own horn. For the
second time in three years, the Red Sox are in the playoffs, once
again a baseball surprise, and he was asked which of the hundreds
of moves he has made has satsfied him the most. Which was his best
move?
</P>
<P>
   ``(Picking) Jimy Williams as the manager,'' was Duquette's
reply. ``Jimy's done a nice job. He came into the organization from
the Braves with a winning attitude and he's worked effectively. And
Jimy's set a good tone for the whole organization.''
</P>
<P>
   And then Duquette was off, off to watch his team win another
game against Baltimore, and now off to Cleveland, off to the
playoffs. And that is the bottom line for any general manager in
baseball. All else is buzz and noise.

TEXAS REGULATOR URGES BANKS TO PREPARE FOR YK2 JITTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SANFORD NOWLIN  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Bankers should be prepared for consumers to
withdraw their money in anticipation of the effects of the year
2000 computer glitch, the top bank regulator in Texas told industry
leaders Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state banking regulators expect some consumers to
pull their money out of banks prior to Jan. 1, 2000, Texas Banking
Commissioner Catherine Ghiglieri said. However, she added, the
industry has made great strides to deal with the problem known
variously as the ``YK2'' problem or the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be some folks who decide to take their cash out,''
Ghiglieri told the 24th annual convention of the Independent
Bankers Association of Texas. However, consumer education should
prevent massive withdrawals, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Federal Reserve has ordered extra currency and
banking regulators have advised lending institutions to keep
additional cash on hand for the turn of the century, Ghiglieri
said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve officials could not be reached for comment on
the Texas regulator's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Computer experts fear that many computers originally programmed
to recognize only the last two digits of a year will fail or
malfunction on Jan. 1, 2000, when the machines will assume it is
1900.
</P>
<P>
   The banking industry nationwide is considered among the
best-prepared to deal with the problem. Many already have spent
millions of dollars to replace or reprogram their computers.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Evans, chairman of San Antonio-based Cullen/Frost Bankers
Inc., said banks must continue to inform consumers of their
progress if they wish to head off cash withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our responsibility not to let that happen,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   Frost has conducted educational seminars on the millennium bug
for consumers and businesses. Officials with smaller banks said
they also are stepping up efforts educate customers about the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of Texas banks are ``satisfactorily'' dealing
with potential glitches, according to a survey completed in May by
Texas regulators. The number is expected to climb higher when
regulators conduct a follow-up investigation next year, Ghiglieri
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ghiglieri said the state's banks generally are prepared to deal
with the computer bug. However, she said, ``we're not promising
there will not be the isolated ATM machine that doesn't work.''

BUCK YOUNG IN YEARS, LONG ON EXPERIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is not even 30 years old, but Joe Buck, 29, Fox's lead
baseball anouncer, has been around.
</P>
<P>
   By age 15, his father, legendary St. Louis Cardinals radio
announcer Jack Buck, had taken him to every major league city.
Young Buck hung out in the Cardinals clubhouse and the press box,
and befriended players and announcers. When he turned 19, he was
calling games on his own.
</P>
<P>
   It was Triple A ball, but every now and then he got the chance
to fill in at Busch Stadium and call a Cardinal game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got through it,'' said Buck, who along with analysts Tim
McCarver and Bob Brenly will call this year's playoffs and World
Series. ``I sounded all right, but I could tell in my voice that I
was hoping that I didn't have to call anything complicated or
explain a difficult situation. I didn't want to mess up.''
</P>
<P>
   Those nervous days have long since passed. Buck says he now
looks forward to big-time drama and is able to explain more by
talking less. As a result, he has emerged as not only a great
play-by-play announcer but also a great guy, a young man given a
tremendous head start who has remained as respectful to the game as
those who have preceded him.
</P>
<P>
   Buck's style became evident through the last month of the
season. He called Mark McGwire's record-breaking 62d home run in a
simple and direct manner: ``It's down the left-field line ... is it
enough? ... Gone.''
</P>
<P>
   When McGwire missed first base, Buck used the opportunity to
share what everybody knew but hadn't said aloud: ``Don't forget to
touch first base, Mac. You are the new single-season home run
champion.'' The home run chase arguably provided Buck with the most
exciting moments he has had in his 10-year broadcasting career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like people hung on every word during every game at
every at-bat,'' said Buck, who at 27 called his first World Series,
the 1996 Classic between the Yankees and Braves. ``You could tell
by the flash bulbs at All-Star Games or the World Series, people
would take pictures maybe during the first pitch, and that was it.
Not for McGwire. It was every time he came up.''
</P>
<P>
   Without naming names, Buck said he often turns the volume down
on games where the announcers talk on and on and on. ``I'm pretty
comfortable now,'' Buck said. ``I don't feel the need to show
people who I am by talking every second. I'm more willing to let
the game breathe on its own.''
</P>
<P>
   Buck learned an invaluable lesson from his father. ``My father
is one of those guys that has a zero ego,'' Buck said. ``He would
tell me all the time that what he did for a living was not
important. The people tuning into the games wanted to hear the
games, not listen to the announcers.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Buck learned well.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Red Sox' chances in the postseason? ``Mark McGwire
told me that (Pedro) Martinez is one of the nastiest pitchers in
the league,'' Buck said. ``Mac told me that Pedro can make batters
feel as if they were behind in the count even though they were
ahead 3-0 or 3-1.''
</P>
<P>
   Buck went on to explain that the Red Sox front three of
Martinez, Tim Wakefield, and Bret Saberhagen is solid, and reliever
Tom ``Flash'' Gordon is just plain ``nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson I learned from the 1996 series is that anything can
happen,'' Buck said. ``Even the most diehard Yankees fans were
calling the series over when the Braves pulled out front, 2-0, but
the Yankees pulled it out.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: ``It's not the quanity of time, it's the quality of
time''
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most weekends, a Dallas executive named James Halpin flies home
to Connecticut to see his wife and two children. Halpin is the CEO
of a chain of computer stores and he's been at it five years. If
you're at the top, you make sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, it hasn't been easy,'' his wife, Joanne, told
Business Week magazine, but ``he is providing us with a wonderful
life.'' She doesn't say what a wonderful life is, but you get the
sense of what she probably means _ a life rich in material goods.
</P>
<P>
   Halpin, who's 48, explains it this way: ``When you're a
high-level executive, your kids are not going to see you that much
during the week, living at home or not. If I were working in New
England, I'd still be traveling three days a week or working
12-hour days.''
</P>
<P>
   Taken only as a statement of fact, this is true enough _ and not
just for those self-satisfied enough to call themselves high-level
executives. But then Halpin's moorings broke completely loose and
he floated up, up and away, like a balloon you'll never see again.
It's not the quantity of time, he said, it's ``the quality of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, quality time, the last resort of parents who aren't
there.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine one of Halpin's vice presidents, called on the carpet
for not putting in enough hours, telling him, ``Look, Jim, I'm
giving you quality time.'' It wouldn't happen. We apply one
standard to the workplace, another to our family, and deny that our
kids are getting short shrift.
</P>
<P>
   The person who can rationalize his life this way is either
dishonest or deluding himself. There being no reason to doubt
Halpin's honesty, you can only pity him. But you feel more for his
kids, who years from now will remember their dad as the guy who
flew in on Friday nights, picked them up and gave them big hugs,
loaded up the van and drove everybody to the soccer games on
Saturday, asked breezily how school was coming and flew back out on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a wonderful life, their mom says. ``When he's here,
he's here 100 percent,'' Joanne Halpin says, sounding a little
apologetic. Yeah, but he's not there very much.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows about the plight of working moms, trying to
balance job and family. What about working dads? You don't hear
much about them, but they have their own balancing act to work out
and most aren't very good at it. ``The Daddy Trap,'' Business Week
calls it in its Sept. 21 issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last two decades,'' the magazine says, ``expectations
of men at home have intensified dramatically. Dads are more
involved with their families, and in general they enjoy that
heightened role. Yet their jobs haven't adjusted. Faced with
pressure to take on more child-rearing and household chores,
fathers still find themselves locked into rigid full-time jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that dads are no more satisfied with their
situation than moms. They're just not as likely to do much about
it. They've not had to be the adept jugglers that working women
are, and they live with greater economic insecurity. ``The thing
I'm always struck by,'' James Levine, author of ``Working
Fathers,'' told Business Week, ``is how much men keep this to
themselves. There's this unwitting collusion between men and women
and employers. No one wants to put this on the table, so the
assumption is perpetuated that it's a woman's issue.''
</P>
<P>
   You know what they say: Europeans work to live, while Americans
live to work. But a survey of 6,328 working parents conducted by
Business Week and the Center for Work &AMP; Family at Boston University
suggests something else: Many American men know their lives are
draining away in those mindless meetings, in the Holiday Inns where
they lay their head many nights, in the struggle not just to
produce but to prove themselves.
</P>
<P>
   If women are torn between family and work (forget ``career'';
for most it's just a job), why shouldn't the same be said for men?
A man needs the satisfaction of work well done. It's built into his
nature and then reinforced by cultural values. But for every man
who will honestly tell you he loves his work, you'll find two
others in whom the fires have died and resignation has set in. By
midlife, many have found that they can't be the father they want to
be while also giving the company 60 hours a week _ or more. Between
work and family they have no time for themselves. They don't read,
exercise only on weekends, close their minds to the world and its
multitude of interests. These men are trapped as much as any woman.
</P>
<P>
   So they plod on, stoic beasts in their harness. When two ride
the same horse, one must sit in back, and you know who that's going
to be. But that's OK. They're getting quality time.

   EMBASSIES-FUTURE _ WASHINGTON _ As we race into the next century
of faxes, e-mail and instant worldwide newscasting, America's
diplomatic system is still grounded in the horse-and-buggy era. The
terrorist bombings of two remote U.S. embassies in East Africa
offers a reminder that the United States has a visible and often
vulnerable presence in almost every nation, at a cost of more than
$2 billion a year. Many of these outposts date from the Cold War
era, when the United States was fighting a propaganda war for the
hearts and minds of even the tiniest nation. But is that necessary
now? After budget cuts, the U.S. State Department has made some
reductions, but U.S. domestic agencies have created more and more
overseas postings. Some experts, including government auditors, are
looking for ways to reshape the embassy system. Among the ideas:
setting up regional embassies to serve several countries, hiring
private contractors to gather information normally collected by
diplomats, and far greater use of high tech communications.

   RUSSIA-REGIONS _ SARATOV, Russia _ The political and financial
disorder of Moscow seems faraway and irrelevant in this city on the
mighty Volga River, in the heart of Russia's southern farming and
industrial district. When the current economic crisis seized the
country two months ago, the regional governor of Saratov overlooked
concerns of national unity and put his 2.7 million people first.
Gov. Dmitri Ayatskov, 47, identified by President Boris Yeltsin
himself as a rising young star who may be president someday, warned
that if the national government cannot fix Russia's problems
``undoubtedly the governors will unite their efforts to solve the
problems themselves,'' he told the Cox News Service in a recent
interview. The central authority of Moscow has been undermined by
the economic turmoil in Russia, prompting governors across the
country's 89 regions to usurp the role of the federal government --
and in some cases to defy it in mutinous fashion. (Holmes, Cox News

normally based in Europe have never been to Bosnia before; some
have never been stationed anywhere but Fort Hood. We'll accompany a
patrol through a northern segment of the Zone of Separation, a
narrow strip of land that winds all over the country dividing the
former warring parties. The northern part of Bosnia is still the
most contentious and their job here is very different from soldiers
who patrol the relatively quiet streets of Sarajevo. Here, they put
on flack jackets and helmets when they wake up in the morning and
they don't take them off until they go to bed, even if they stay on
McGovern Base all day long. About 1,000 soldiers from Fort Hood
will ultimately be stationed at this northern base, with the rest
scattered around the country. (Nesmith, Cox News Service).

There are no volcanoes or rain forests, and hardly any rivers. But

villages, flowering trees and open pastures. There are also a wide
variety of historic sites, dating back to the 17th century. There
are, for example, fabulous castles and forts to visit. Also, this

   Russell about to go from being an unknown to being a star

<P>
   Tonight, Keri Russell goes from kinda-known to full-blown in one
hour with the debut of ``Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old California native has a decent string of movie
and TV roles for such a young age, but nothing to prepare her for
the kind of attention she'll be getting from teens and young adults
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't grow up wanting to be an actor,'' she says. ``I was a
dancer, and I fell into this business'' when Disney executives saw
her on ``Star Search'' and cast her on ``The Mickey Mouse Club'' in
1989, when she was 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicity,'' she says, is ``really like the first thing I've
done that I've been really proud of, which is a huge thing.'' She's
about to find out how huge _ think Calista ``Ally McBeal''
Flockhart for a younger demo.

 &HT;    ``Felicity'' is the best new drama of the season
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Basically,'' says 17-year-old Felicity Porter, ``I gave up
everything my parents planned for me, everything I expected, all
for a boy I don't even know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically,'' says Ben Covington, the boy for whom Felicity
gave up everything, the boy she didn't even know, ``I'm a shallow
loser.''
</P>
<P>
   Meet WB's ``Felicity,'' the best new drama in a profoundly
undramatic new season. Basically. At once painfully self-aware and
exuberantly skin-deep, filmed to feel like a self-contained
feature, it's the kind of coming-of-age TV in which teen girls
especially will find what their older sisters found in ``Ally
McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Keri Russell stars as the button-nosed, luminously plain title
character, a bright new high school grad headed toward a future her
overachieving parents have plotted ``pretty much since I was a
zygote.'' She's been wired to go to Stanford pre-med, then become a
doctor. Easy. But standing in a crimson robe on a bright green lawn
with her fellow high school grads, Felicity sure doesn't feel like
a future doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surrounded by people actually looking forward to their
lives,'' she narrates gamely.
</P>
<P>
   Then fate steps in, pushing her toward voted-most-popular
classmate Ben (Scott Speedman). She's never really met him, but
asks him to sign her yearbook. He takes his time. His thoughtful
note ends, ``Love, Ben,'' and next thing we know she has followed
him to college 3,000 miles away in New York.
</P>
<P>
   This turns out to be much more than the dizzy act of a mixed-up,
boy-crazy TV character. It's a girl desperate to become her own
woman, to blow it and move on, without her parents' advice or car
keys.
</P>
<P>
   ``This all might be a colossal mistake,'' she says. ``On the
other hand, maybe it'll save my life or something. I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell embraces her awkwardness with cool jitteriness. Her eyes
are never still; they seem to look outside and inside at the same
time. She talks in the contradictory, run-on musings that in others
sounds inarticulate, but here becomes a kind of roughed out poetry.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't a clunker in this young cast, which includes new
best friend Julie (Amy Jo Johnson) and resident dorm advisor Noel
(Scott Crane from ``Dawson's Creek''), a sweetie who's sweet on
Felicity.
</P>
<P>
   But the privileged air that hangs over Felicity, even as she
stiff-arms her parents, can turn the room uncomfortably close _
it's a soapy grace note meant to make the show more accessible,
even as it makes it more maddening. Sometimes we suffer with
Felicity, and sometimes she's just insufferable.
</P>
<P>
   As in the late, great ``My So-Called Life,'' Felicity's interior
circuitry is revealed through voice-overs. She talks into a tape
recorder for a high school French teacher named Sally, a mentor
whose fiance was killed three months before their wedding and who
has dropped out in Santa Fe. Their taped back-and-forths ground the
chaos in Felicity's life, and Sally's words echo almost gurulike.
They observe keenly, but rarely judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things happen to us, but it's our reactions that matter,''
Sally says on one tape. ``I just want you to know I think you made
a really great choice and I can't wait to hear what happens next.''
</P>
<P>
   Basically, neither can we.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicity''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   9 EDT tonight on WB
</P>
<P>
   The Verdict: Basically, it's the season's best new show.

 &HT;    Two magazines offer different expcerpt of ``A Man in Full''
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just who is Charlie Croker? Readers curious about which Atlanta
real estate developer Tom Wolfe drew on for his upcoming novel, ``A
Man in Full,'' can get a preview in two excerpts this week.
</P>
<P>
   In the second of three excerpts in Rolling Stone ($3), Croker
and his financial aide Wismer Stroock are introduced at a meeting
with PlannersBanc senior loan officer Raymond Peepgrass and his
contingent. ``Croker was all heartiness and manly charm and bluster
and Down-Home drawl and cagey Old Dawg of the South; Stroock was
all MBA Youth and Low Cholesterol and High-Density Lipids and
Semiconductor Circuits, and by his voice you couldn't tell where he
was from, unless it was the Wharton Business School. Yes, he said,
Croker Global had borrowed a total of $515 million from
PlannersBanc; and yes, Croker Global had now failed to come up with
$36 million in scheduled interest payments and a scheduled $60
million repayment of principal.''
</P>
<P>
   Peepgrass' proposed solution is to sell off the company's BMWs
and Ferrari, some of the four aircraft, and, to Croker's horror,
his beloved South Georgia plantation, Turpmtine. After the meeting,
Croker flies down to Turpmtine and, to reinforce his besieged
manhood, the 60-year-old former Georgia Tech football star captures
a seven-foot rattlesnake with his bare hands in front of the amazed
hired help.
</P>
<P>
   In the Men's Journal ($3.95) excerpt, Croker finds catching an
angry rattlesnake is child's play compared to handling his
28-year-old ``trophy wife'' Serena, whom he had married after
dumping his longtime spouse.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to sleep because of his financial problems, Croker rises
before 4 a.m., gets dressed in his riding outfit and inadvertently
sets off the burglar alarm. After enduring a tongue-lashing from
Serena, Croker wonders why all those experts on television never
talked about rich men like himself who had divorced their old wives
and taken on girls a generation younger. ``What if a man goes
through all that, the separation, the divorce, all that agony, that
struggle, that hellish expense, that ... that ... that guilt ...
and one day, or one night, he wakes up and wonders, Who the hell is
this in the bed next to me? Why is she here? What does she want?
Why won't she leave?''
</P>
<P>
   A WOMAN IN FULL: Wolfe could not have gained access to the lives
of the city's real estate moguls had it not been for his friend
Mary Rose Taylor. In a well-written profile in Atlanta ($3.50),
Emma Edmunds reveals the iron will of the former TV anchorwoman who
rescued the Margaret Mitchell House from the wrecking ball and
rebuilt it after two fires. As Wolfe's entree to Atlanta's elite,
Taylor set up interviews with developers, took him to South Georgia
plantations and faxed him background for his book.
</P>
<P>
   GRAND OPRAH: On the eve of the release of the film version of
Toni Morrison's ``Beloved,'' Oprah Winfrey talks to Time ($2.95)
about her role as Sethe, a character based on Margaret Garner, a
renegade slave who tried to kill her children rather than see them
returned to slavery. A collector of slave memorabilia, Winfrey
bought plantation records and kept them in her dressing room while
filming the movie.
</P>
<P>
   WRITERS ON CLINTON: In a literary-heavy New Yorker ($3), authors
Morrison, Janet Malcolm, James Salter, Lorrie Moore, Louis Begley,
Jane Smiley and Ethan Canin weigh in on the president and his
problems. Clinton is actually our first black president, Morrison
writes. ``After all, Clinton displays almost every trope of
blackness: single-parent household, born poor, working-class,
saxophone-playing, McDonald's-and-junk-food-loving boy from
Arkansas.'' Comparing Kenneth Starr's investigation to the tactics
whites use to punish African-Americans who forget their place, she
says the message is clear: ``No matter how smart you are, how hard
you work ... we will put you in your place.'' Also of note: Michael
Specter's critical view of the Nobel Committee, and Richard Ford's
lovely essay on his friendship with short story master Raymond
Carver.
</P>
<P>
   QUICK READS: The October Dossier ($3.95) offers a glossy look at
the price of Atlanta's good life. Tuition at the Lovett School, for
example, is $10,635 annually; a weekly manicure/pedicure at Spa
Sydell adds up to $2,600 a year; and a golf and town club
membership at Capital City Club, providing you can wait that long,
is $40,000 for an initiation fee and $300 in monthly dues.

 &HT;    Tavis Tritt has a new album out, tries a little acting
 &HT;    By Russ Devault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Travis Tritt, the unrepentent southern rocker who steps into
country from time to time, has released eight albums that have
produced 11 No. 1 singles and sales of more than 17 million copies.
So, given the additional exposure he's getting in movies (CBS-TV
will air ``Outlaw Justice'' later this year), there's no reason to
think ``No More Looking Over My Shoulder'' won't add significantly
to his numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Produced by Tritt and Nashville stalwart Billy Joe Walker Jr.,
the album, due Oct. 13 from Warner Bros., is a solid blend of
kick-it tunes (``Rough Around The Edges'') and ballads (``If I Lost
You''). Tritt wrote or co-wrote five of the 10 tunes with others
coming from Bruce Springsteen (``Tougher Than The Rest'') and
newcomer Michael Peterson (the title cut).

RED SOX, POSTSEASON GHOST EYEBALL TO EYEBALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ These Red Sox are different. They are not a team of
wall-bashing mastodons, winning games 11-10 when the fair wind
blows out at Fenway. They have the pitching and defense to stay the
course when the gales shift in October. And they will not succumb
to the hex that has swallowed Sox teams for the last 80 years. They
will not fall in autumn.
</P>
<P>
   This is the popular spin on the 1998 Red Sox, a team that won 92
games, second-most in the American League. The Sox meet the
Cleveland Indians in the first game of a best-of-five postseason
series, and New Englanders are unusually confident about Boston's
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez (19-7) starts on the mound for the Red Sox and
his presence explains the faith of the fandom. The Sox committed
$75 million to Martinez last winter with the understanding that he
could win the big games. Like this one.
</P>
<P>
   Because he pitches for the Red Sox, Pedro will be lugging some
extra baggage to the mound at shiny Jacobs Field. The Red Sox have
lost a major league-record 13 consecutive postseason games. Sorry,
but we can't let go of this sad stat until the Sox finally win one.
</P>
<P>
   The woeful streak started on that fateful October night in 1986
when a ground ball slipped between Bill Buckner's legs. You know
the rest. The Buckner video has become the Zapruder film of New
England sports, stored in the Sci-Fi/Horror section of most
Blockbuster outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Boston hasn't won a meaningful autumn game since Bruce Hurst
beat the Mets in Game 5 in 1986. Since then, starting with Billy
Buck, it's 13 straight _ two vs. the Mets, four against the Oakland
A's in 1988, four more to the A's in '90, and three straight
against Cleveland in 1995. Roger Clemens and Mike Greenwell suited
up for every one of those ghastly losses.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)Thirteen(unitals) straight. Yeesh. Even the number is
unlucky.
</P>
<P>
   But now the Sox are back, playing the Indians again, bursting
with optimism. Boston went 8-3 against the Tribe this season.
Cleveland played in the pathetic American League Central Division
and was allowed to coast all season long. The Indians staggered to
the finish and appear beatable.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't the case three years ago when the Red Sox came to
Cleveland to start a best-of-five series. Game 1 was played on the
night of the infamous O.J. Simpson verdict and was delayed for an
hour by rain. It ended at 2:08 a.m. when ex-Sox catcher Tony Pena
homered on a 3-and-0 pitch from the inimitable Zane Smith. The Sox
lost because ace reliever Rick Aguilera _ the Mets' winning pitcher
in the Buckner Game 6 of '86 _ coughed up a gopher ball to Albert
Belle in the bottom of the 11th. The mistake erased a Boston lead
and set up Pena's game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   Orel Hershiser blanked Boston the next night, then the Sox came
home to drop the third and final game, 8-2. Mo Vaughn, in his MVP
season, went 0 for 14 in the series with seven strikeouts. Mo has
been carrying that doughnut for three years and is anxious to
atone.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's postseason flop is all too typically Red Sox-ian. Ted
Williams hit .200 with no homers in his only World Series (1946),
and Roger Clemens managed to win only one of nine postseason starts
for the Sox. Even Carl Yastrzemski, heroic in most of his October
battles, lives with the nightmare of popping up against Rich
Gossage for the final out of the 1978 playoff against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   This being the Red Sox, there are ghosts all over the joint.
Dennis Eckersley, who was a 20-game winner for the '78 Sox, is back
with Boston. Eck was MVP of Oakland's 1988 ALCS sweep against
Boston. Dwight Gooden, who starts tomorrow afternoon for the Tribe
against Boston, was the starting pitcher _ for the Mets _ of the
last postseason game won by the Red Sox. Perhaps those are good
omens.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Red Sox feel no need for good luck of any sort. They
got here on their ability and they expect to win on performance.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, there hasn't been much ``sky-is-falling'' hysteria at
Fenway this year. After four score years of self-pity, the
narcissists of Red Sox Nation seem content to let the Townies
actually play a couple of games before forecasting doom.
</P>
<P>
   But if Pedros loses ...

 &HT;    ABC's new drama has lots of violence and lots of action
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The words come slow and deliberate, spoken in the unemotional
wheeze of a Sgt. Joe Friday. ``We live in a world, you and I, where
people can kill someone and get a book deal out of it because they
have the right lawyer. Or they get an acting teacher who teaches
them how to cry on camera ... I don't have to tolerate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither, anymore, do you. TV's got a new equalizer. And he's
badder than the baddest bad guy.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Madsen is the good guy in black in ABC's
violence-riddled new drama ``Vengeance Unlimited'' (debuting at 10
EDT tonight on ABC before settling into its usual time slot at 8
p.m. ET Thursday).
</P>
<P>
   Don't take this show lightly. Better yet, find some place to
hide.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Madsen as one of the crooks in ``Reservoir Dogs''? He
was the freaky dude with the sharp razor, dancing to ``Stuck in the
Middle With You'' while slicing off a tied-up cop's ear. Charming
fella.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Vengeance,'' Madsen is Mr. Chapel, the savior of the
downtrodden. When the court and cops fail victims and let justice
slip away, he steps out of the shadows and does a kind of
``Reservoir'' dance _ only with less blood _ to ensure that crime
doesn't pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have sinned, suffering is our gift,'' Mr. Chapel
slowly tells Edward Pike, a particularly nasty money launderer who
has unjustly escaped conviction for a particularly nasty murder he
committed. ``Well, Ed, get ready for Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, Madsen is orchestrating a dance of revenge to this
show's music box tinkling of ``Strangers in the Night.'' The money
launderer, his crooked lawyer, his even more crooked dope smuggling
partner _ they all get a comeuppance at the brutal hands of Mr.
Chapel.
</P>
<P>
   We'll spare you the details about the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Just know that when his prey struggles, Mr. Chapel lets out a
line like this: ``If you try that again, I'll break every bone in
your body. One per second. That's 206 seconds. Maybe seven, give or
take a bone.''
</P>
<P>
   Beware. It's eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth. And burn the
other guy's cheek.

   ``Buffy'' still kicking
</P>
<P>
   Well before ``Felicity'' captured this moment's cool-show buzz,
``Buffy, the Vampire Slayer'' (8 EDT tonight on WB) was raking in
the teen viewers. And it's still a show to be reckoned with, as its
season premiere provides both a lead-in to ``Felicity'' and a
darker, denser ``Buffy'' than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Our kick-boxing, pun-spouting, undead-bashing heroine (Sarah
Michelle Gellar) is still reeling from last season's finale, when
she had to vanquish her vampire-lover Angel (David Boreanaz). So
she's checked out of Sunnydale, changed her name and shucked her
calling, living near some unnamed Skid Row full of street kids and
hustlers.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the supernatural won't let Buff get away, as she
stumbles onto a ministry that's really luring the street kids into
a literal hell that gives new meaning to the concept of speeding up
the assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back in Sunnydale, Buff's friends (Willow, Xander,
etc.) are trying to stem the vampire tide with rather feeble
results.
</P>
<P>
   One of several things that makes ``Buffy'' enjoyable is its mix
of work ethic (Buffy) and slacker humor (her classmates), as when a
Sunnydale football player remarks in passing that the high school
team will have a good season this year if they can manage
discipline, focus and fewer unexplained deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Series creator Joss Whedon wrote and directed tonight's premiere
and it shows. ``Buffy'' still kicks.

   ``Frontline'' takes a look at Somalia
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's ``Frontline'' (PBS-check local listings) takes a hard
look at previous U.S. peacekeeping operations in Somalia with
``Ambush in Mogadishu.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a stunning recounting of the August 1993 attack on U.S.
forces by Somalian factions that left 18 Americans and anywhere
from 350 to 1,000 Somalians dead. One American body was dragged
through the streets by Somalians in a media powerplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ambush'' is a harrowing tale _ one that fingerpoints at
problems between the American military and the Clinton
administration that helped lead to a breakdown in the operation
that began in 1992 to help feed the starving millions in the
troubled African nation.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, caught in all the red-tape hoopla are the U.S.
servicemen, including two Georgians interviewed for the film: Anton
Berendsen of Woodstock and Kenny Thomas of Columbus. They were
assigned with others to conduct a raid to capture a Somalian
warload (his codename: Elvis) at the same time America had opened
channels to negotiate with him.
</P>
<P>
   It was a trap. ``We got snookered,'' one military official says.
</P>
<P>
   A 90-minute operation then turned into 17 hours of gunfire on
the streets of Mogadishu. It was already a place one charity worker
describes as ``a Mad Max film'' with mass killings and mass
lootings at the hands of roving Somalian factions riding in Jeeps
armed with mounted machine guns.
</P>
<P>
   In horrifying detail, the American soldiers recount the intense
and bloody battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not fighting to be a hero,'' one says. ``You're
thinking about your sense of duty and the man next to you. You're
thinking about staying alive.''

MARTINEZ GETS CHANCE TO SHOW HE CAN BE A PLAYOFF PITCHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was the fourth inning. The game was not going well.
Mo Vaughn was concerned about Pedro Martinez. Concerned the Red
Sox' ace was trying to do too much. And this _ the Red Sox'
possible wild-card-clinching game against Baltimore _ was no time
for Martinez to fail. Absolutely not.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I saw was that Pedro was trying too hard to make every
pitch a perfect pitch,'' said Vaughn. ``And you can't make every
pitch a perfect pitch. `Throw your game,' I was thinking. He did
not have to carry this whole ship.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Hoiles had taken Martinez deep into the net in the second
inning for a two-run homer. And now Calvin Pickering _ who had ever
heard of him outside of Baltimore? _ had sent a rocket off Martinez
into the bleachers over the Red Sox bullpen. Martinez was wobbly.
He hadn't won a game in September and, whatever can be said about
Roger Clemens's October woes, at least Clemens won in September.
Martinez wasn't even doing that.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn took a step toward the mound to talk to Martinez ... and
stopped. ``You've got to pick your spot,'' said Vaughn. ``Over the
last 10 days, I've decided that when I want to say something, I'll
say it. I was just waiting for the right spot.''
</P>
<P>
   But now Cal Ripken singled and it looked far worse than just a
3-1 deficit. Martinez was on the ropes, and any Red Sox playoff
hopes had to be dim if Pedro Martinez is not pitching well, very
well. So Vaughn ambled over to the mound and talked to Martinez ...
and talked some more ... and then talked some more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him he was trying too hard,'' said Vaughn. ``I told him
that he couldn't be perfect and that he couldn't strike out every
batter in the game. I told him, `Just pitch to your strength and if
you make a pitch that you get beat off, so what? We've got 25 guys
behind you.'''
</P>
<P>
   That was the first 30 seconds of the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I told him, `These guys behind you will make the plays.
You make your pitches and we'll make the plays and we'll hit the
ball. You know what I mean?'''
</P>
<P>
   And Vaughn kept talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that I thought he was trying to be perfect. I told
him again to pitch to his spot and we'll make the plays and we'll
get some runs for him. The main thing was that he doesn't have to
carry this whole ship.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn ambled back to first base. Martinez then threw to B.J.
Surhoff, who cracked a hard hopper back to the mound, an
inning-ending 1-6-3 double play. A near disaster was avoided.
Martinez held on _ admittedly not pitching his best _ and the Red
Sox won the game and their spot in the playoffs. It was as it had
to be _ the ace pitched and won the game that propelled the Red Sox
into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mo just came over and told me to go back to the same things I
was doing,'' said Martinez, a bit irked to be asked about a game in
which he did not pitch well. ``He told me, `We're behind you and
we're going to play defense for you and we're going to do it.' But
no more looking back ... it's playoff time right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-five million dollars is beyond the ken of virtually all
baseball fans, but this much is known to all Boston fans: that sum
of money demands that Martinez pitch well when the situation
demands good pitching. But Martinez has never been in this
situation, pitching in the postseason, and Red Sox fans will be
watching closely to see how he pitches under true pressure for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   And he will be judged not by his 19 wins, but how he does this
week and many weeks to follow. That is as it should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great ... I feel healthy,'' said Martinez. ``I actually
feel strong, very strong, and I have everything there. I'm just
missing a little bit with some of the pitches. But I'll correct
that. Ill be better in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   It is now Martinez's moment. And he knows it as well as we know
it.
</P>
<P>
   Year after year he would watch playoff games on television and
year after year he would watch World Series games (``I always do
it, I always watch'') and he would wonder what he was missing. He
would wonder how he would do in such situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``After being on the 1994 team for Montreal, and not being able
to get anywhere the next few years, with the team that could have
been the team of the '90s, but the team was broken down like we
were,'' said Martinez. ``That was so hard for me. But at least now
I have a chance to see what I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the great question for all professional athletes, the
question that goes unanswered until it answers itself _ unanswered
in fans' minds but also lurking deep in the minds of the athletes
themselves. The most pressurized moments. Who will produce? Who
won't? The question is still unanswered for Martinez because this
will be his first chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I am greatly happy,'' said Martinez. ``I am greatly happy
to have the opportunity to prove myself in the playoffs and see how
well I do.''
</P>
<P>
   The playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   Martinez smiled as he answered the question. ``Of course, I am
(psyched) ... that's the reason why we are here. That's the reason
why we started the season.''
</P>
<P>
   As Martinez himself admits, ``I did not have the best results
for myself'' in his last regular-season appearance last Thursday,
and, indeed, for the month of September. He has not pitched poorly
but neither has he been the ace of aces.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Red Sox clinched, Martinez _ and members of his
family _ were smoking big cigars and ducking champagne showers. And
the pitcher said he felt ``good'' about the accomplishment ``but
it's the ones ahead, it's those games where I'll feel great. We
haven't accomplished anything yet. We have some more work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, the topic would come back to Martinez getting
his first chance to be an October pitcher, or the unhappy flip side
of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this means everything,'' he said. ``I've never had the
chance ... but I've got the opportunity now and now I am just going
to try and prove myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in mid-summer, Martinez expressed apprehension about the
intensity of Boston's baseball fans. He will soon learn _ for good
or ill _ that what he saw or felt in the summer is nothing compared
to what he will see in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   It is Pedro Martinez's chance. His first in the playoffs.

DAFOE WITHSTANDS PRESEASON TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Byron Dafoe went into the past offseason knowing that
for the first time in his career, he would come back in the fall as
the No. 1 goalie.
</P>
<P>
   When he was in Washington and Los Angeles, Dafoe was always
fighting for a job and playing time. But after posting a 30-25-9
record, 2.24 goals-against average, and .914 save percentage for
the Bruins in 1997-98, he was able to relax a bit _ or as much as
any professional athlete can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'm riding my laurels from last year,'' said Dafoe,
who was very sharp in Sunday's 2-1 exhibition loss to the Florida
Panthers. ``Not that it gives me the automatic No. 1 job, but on
the other hand, I've still got to work hard and prove to everyone
I'm the No. 1 guy in camp. But I think (coach Pat Burns) kind of
had me pegged that coming in. I had to more or less play myself out
rather than get myself there. It was kind of nice. It's the first
year I've ever had that coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason the Bruins opted not to buy out the remaining portion
of Jim Carey's contract was that management wanted an insurance
policy in case Dafoe's left shoulder, surgically repaired during
the summer, didn't come around right away. It has, although it took
a while to give it a true test. Dafoe could've taken a nap during
much of his earlier exhibition work (against Pittsburgh in
particular, when he faced six weak shots). But he was tested
heavily by the Panthers. They ran him, knocked him over, and
otherwise whacked him around (Dave Gagner in particular). The
result? No problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, when you're injured and you have surgery in the
offseason, you try to put it out of your mind,'' he said. ``Come
game situations, you can't (think about it). I can honestly say I
didn't get one twinge, and that's a typical game I'm going to have
throughout the season. If I'm having that at 3 1/2 months postop,
come four months, it should be perfect. It was a good test for me.
I felt great. My shoulder didn't bother me once. I haven't had many
shots in the previous two games, so it was a more realistic-type
game and I felt very good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got pushed around a little bit during a couple of flurries,
but it stood up fine. I'm past the point of worrying about it. It
proved its test. The other games, it felt fine, too, but it didn't
really get challenged. (On Sunday) I got challenged with a couple
of glove saves here and there, and it definitely passed the test. I
think I've played well so far. I probably have one more game left
to get myself to 100 percent, and I'm just looking forward to the
start of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   In three games, Dafoe is 1-1-0 with a 1.50 GAA and .932 save
percentage. He and Carey shared a 4-0 shutout in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   There's one adjustment all goalies must make _ to the extra
space around the net. The 2 feet added between the net and end
boards may not look like much, but it could be no man's land if a
goalie wanders too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a huge difference,'' said Dafoe.
``Obviously, there are some dump-ins you're not going to get to,
and you know that now. Personally, I think it's more room to dangle
for me. I have to remember I'm not back there to set up plays. I'm
there to just leave the puck. If anything, it gives me more room to
handle the puck. Usually, I'd go every time, but there's no sense
because you don't want to get caught out when it gets picked up on
the other side. I think it will take a few games to figure out when
you have a chance and when you shouldn't even bother.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe likes to wander back there, but he knows that if he gets
burned by a bad play, he's likely to get scorched by Burns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always take a quick look over at the bench after I've done
something back behind the net,'' said Dafoe, laughing, ``just to
see what he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After three games in three nights and four in five, Burns gave
everyone a day off Monday. He said that by Sunday night, it was
hard to gauge who was doing what since so many players were banged
up or tired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to evaluate,'' said Burns, who cut two players _
Aaron Downey and Terry Virtue _ Sunday night and likely will trim
more after Wednesday's game in Worcester. ``The travel was starting
to wear on us a little bit. But we saw some stuff we wanted to see,
too. They're a big club. They hit us, and we wanted to see how
they'd react to that.''
</P>
<P>
   For the weekend, Burns said, there were good signs and some not
so good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good one against Montreal,'' he said, referring to
Friday's game. ``We didn't get a win but we noticed we're missing a
little bit of scoring power. In South Carolina (Saturday), we
battled back after being down, which was good. (On Sunday), they
came out strong, but we started coming back in the second part of
the game. We have to get back to the way we play, the way we had
success. We can't get caught up ice giving up outnumbered attacks.
We did that (Sunday), and that's not us. If we do that, we're back
to square one. But I think everybody realizes that, too.''

GONZALEZ A STRONG CANDIDATE FOR MVP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Thinking about Nomar Garciaparra as Most
Valuable Player in the American League?
</P>
<P>
   Think again, Red Sox fans. Boston's cleanup-hitting shortstop
may have led the Sox into Round 1 against Cleveland, but Texas
strongman Juan Gonzalez knocked in 157 runs, leading the Rangers to
the American League West title and a date with the muscle-bound
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Walk around the Ranger clubhouse and ask about MVP. Nobody
hesitates for a second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan should be MVP, no doubt in my mind,'' says lefty reliever
Tony Fossas. ``He protects everybody in the lineup. Sure, Nomar is
a shortstop, but so is Alex Rodriguez, and he's going 40-40. When
you look at complete numbers, it's not even close. When you are
talking about MVP, there some things, to me, that shouldn't be
talked about, and that's one of 'em ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly think people don't put enough importance into
RBIs,'' says Ranger backup catcher Bill Haselman _ another ex-Red
Sox. ``I know home runs are exciting, but so is what this guy is
doing. It's unbelievable. I've never seen anything like it. When
guys get on base, he's gonna get 'em in somehow. I played with him
when I was first in baseball in the minors. He was skinnier then.
You always knew he was going to be a great hitter, but nothing like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Melvin also gives the nod to Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been consistent all year,'' says the Rangers' general
manager. ``Plus, he's played pretty good outfield for us. His
performance dictates that he should be the MVP. And he's matured.
He's taken a leadership role on this club.''
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Mark McLemore, a 10-year veteran, doesn't even
answer the question when asked about Juan vs. Nomar. McLemore just
raises an eyebrow and makes a face that can be read as ``Are you
crazy?''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who was AL MVP in 1996 when he hit .314 with 44 homers
and 147 RBIs (despite playing in only 134 games), says, ``I don't
think about MVP right now. It is not important now. That's after
the World Series and that's a long time away. But when I won in
1996, the most important thing was that everybody was so proud of
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers lost a divisional playoff to the Yankees in four
games in 1996, but not because Gonzalez faltered. The big right
fielder cranked five homers in four games, batting .438 (7 for 16)
with nine RBIs. He joined the inimitable Jeffrey Leonard as the
only men to homer in four consecutive games of a postseason series
and matched the postseason single-series record set by Reggie
Jackson in 1977. Gonzalez's 22 total bases in four games tied Babe
Ruth's four-game mark in the 1928 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez looks forward to facing the Yankees again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can beat them, absolutely,'' he says. ``Playing them in '96
was the greatest feeling, and I'd like to play them again. We are
not afraid of them. It's the same. It's baseball. And it's three
out of five. Yankee Stadium is a great ballpark. You never know in
baseball. I like it when you play the Yankees. It's an exciting
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez is from Puerto Rico and hasn't mastered English as well
as many of his countrymen in the majors. He is polite and smiles
easily, but most comfortable speaking Spanish. He likes to sing out
loud (in Spanish) when he walks from the clubhouse to the dugout.
Luis Mayoral, a Spanish-speaking Texas broadcaster, runs some
interference for Gonzalez's interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Big Juan likes the glare of the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like playing when you have a lot of people watching, when
you have pressure. It is different. You have a strong mind for the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   And how does a man drive home 157 runs in a single season?
</P>
<P>
   ``To do it, you have to concentrate. And I see men on base
almost every time I am up. You can't drive in runs without men on
base.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had a lot of men on base this season, leading the
American League with a .289 team batting average. They went only
3-8 against the Yankees, but feel primed for an upset in the short
series. Manager Johnny Oates held back Todd Stottlemyre and Rick
Helling after the Rangers clinched in Seattle last Friday night and
the rotation is set for New York.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is no podunk entry in this eight-team tournament. The
Rangers play in a state-of-the-art ballpark in Arlington and their
payroll is $62 million, right up there with the big boys. Melvin
made major acquisitions for the stretch run (Stottlemyre, Royce
Clayton, and Todd Zeile).
</P>
<P>
   But Gonzalez is the man. His RBI total in 1998 is the most since
Red Sox bookends Ted Williams and Vern Stephens each knocked in 159
in 1949. There was talk early in the year that he could challenge
Hack Wilson's record of 190 in 1930, but this is not the 1930s,
when there were 16 individual seasons of 150 or more RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Staying healthy has been the key for Gonzalez. He missed 29
games because of injuries last year, but missed only eight this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The year before I missed a lot of games,'' he acknowledges.
``This year, I've only missed a few games and I'm very happy. I
work with a personal trainer, two hours a day. When you play a lot
of games, you have more chance to drive in runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Watch him in the batter's box. He digs a deep trench with his
right foot and settles in before every pitch. He steps back out
after every pitch. A little like Nomar.
</P>
<P>
   And he's going to be the MVP. Despite Nomar.
</P>

RUSSIA'S CHIEF TAX COLLECTOR AND ECONOMIC POLICYMAKER IS OUSTED  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL R. GORDON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Russian government's most outspoken reformer was
ousted from his post Monday, leaving policy in the hands of a
unlikely coalition of Communists, regional leaders and Yeltsin
holdovers.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Fyodorov, who served as the nation's chief tax collector
and top economic policymaker, was removed from both positions, the
Kremlin said.
</P>
<P>
   His dismissal comes on the heels of other resignations that have
made a shambles of Prime Minister Yevgeni Primakov's promise to
assemble a well-oiled, professional team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The formation of the government is going very badly,'' said
Grigory Yavlinsky, the head of the liberal Yabloko party who
promoted Primakov for prime minister. ``These people cannot work
together.''
</P>
<P>
   In many respects, this does not seem to be the most auspicious
moment to sack an aide who symbolizes a tough-minded approach to
collecting taxes and has credibility with the West.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is desperate for revenue. Tax receipts are plummeting
along with the ruble. The government's recent efforts at
privatization have been a bust. The sale of state property has
raised 16 percent of the goal for January to August.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is also badly in need of an clear economic plan.
International Monetary Fund officials who recently met with
Primakov and his aides said they left without a coherent idea of
the government's economic program, beyond printing money.
</P>
<P>
   The Primakov government is not entirely devoid of liberals.
Mikhail Zadornov, who was recently appointed as finance minister,
is a free-market advocate. And Alexander Livshits, a former finance
minister, appears to be angling for a high government job.
</P>
<P>
   But they are just a part of a coalition that includes a
Communist central banker, a Communist aide for economic policy and
a left-leaning agriculture minister.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the story of Fyodorov is an especially vivid case study
in the Russian government's inability to chart an economic course,
put the right person in charge and then stick with the plan and the
person.
</P>
<P>
   Western economists were heartened last spring when Fyodorov was
tapped as the head of the State Tax Service in May. A wealthy
investment banker and former finance minister, Fyodorov was brash,
self-assured and avidly pro-capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner was he in office then he instructed his aides to
compile a list of the nation's 1,000 richest citizens. He put
himself on the list, and ordered everybody on it to be audited by
the government.
</P>
<P>
   He launched a campaign to collect back taxes from Gazprom, the
huge natural gas monopoly, which has long enjoyed cozy ties at the
highest level of the government. He joined masked policemen on in
publicity-making raids of tax deadbeats.
</P>
<P>
   After the ruble collapsed and Yeltsin fired Sergei Kiriyenko as
prime minister last month, Fyodorov rode out the political storm.
For a brief moment he emerged as the point man for the Yeltsin
government's effort to pull itself out of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The worldly Fyodorov met with the IMF over the billions of
dollars Russia still hopes to receive in loan disbursement.
</P>
<P>
   He also promoted the currency board approach in which the
exchange rate of the ruble would be fixed and pegged to the hard
currency. Domingo Cavallo, the former Argentine economic minister
who conquered soaring inflation in his own country, described
Fyodorov as a veritable soulmate during his recent visit here.
</P>
<P>
   But it was downhill from there.
</P>
<P>
   After Primakov became prime minister, he began to reach out to
the Communists and they had a score to settle with the outspoken
Fyodorov.
</P>
<P>
   To placate the left, Viktor Gerashenko, the former Central Bank
chairman who presided over the devaluation of the ruble in 1994,
was reappointed to the post. Yury Maslyukov, a Communist, was made
first deputy prime minister with responsibility for economic
matters.
</P>
<P>
   But the Communists continued to bray for Fyodorov's head.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Communists and the Agrarians said that they could not
possible have him in the government,'' said Tom Adshead,
co-director of research at United Financial Group, the investment
company Fyodorov founded.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Fyodorov seemed determined to soldier on. When rumors
circulated earlier this month that he was out of a job, he issued a
defiant statement insisting that he was not leaving. Even Monday
night, Fyodorov's spokesman voiced the hope that he would
eventually land another government job.
</P>
<P>
   Fyodorov's is just the latest casualty in Russia's political
wars. On Friday, Alexander Shohkin, a centrist and ally of former
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, resigned after just ten days in
office.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was leaving to protest the reappointment Zadornov,
who served as finance minister when Russia devalued the rouble in
August. Primakov later fired back castigating Shokhin as
unstatesmanlike.
</P>
<P>
   Dmitry Vasilev, the pro-reform head of the Securities
Commission, also quit. Vasilev warned Monday that Russia was in
danger of abandoning reform to ``return to the late-Gorbachev
era.''
</P>
<P>
   A final casualty was Viktor Khristenko, a former Kiriyenko aide,
was also sacked Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin insisted that it was moving deliberately to put its
team in place and would a new ``stabilization program'' within the
next ten days. To prevent social disorder, it has begun to rush
wages to the military, students and hard-hit regions.
</P>
<P>
   But the prevailing mood seemed to be summed up by a headline in
the newspaper Segodnya, ``Primakov's government Is Falling Apart.''

scene from ``Practical Magic.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    When she was 14 years old, Sandra Bullock sold out.
 &HT;    The self-described ``geek'' started dating a popular wrestler at
her high school.
 &HT;    ``By some fluke, I got on the cheerleading squad,'' she recalls.
``And it was like heaven's gates had opened and I'd heard the
angels sing. I'd walk down the halls and petals would fall around
me.''
 &HT;    But her bliss didn't last.
 &HT;    ``One day, it just hit me,'' the actress says. ``I realized,
`Yesterday these people didn't even know me. Now they love me.'
Suddenly it just seemed so shallow.''
 &HT;    Bullock quit cheerleading, tossed her monogrammed sweaters in
the trash and ``went back to my old dorky self.''
 &HT;    Two years ago, the Virginian-born actress found herself feeling
that way again. Movie-star status gave her exactly the same
feeling, so she opted out of the Hollywood hustle and moved to
Austin, Texas.
 &HT;    ``I sit on my front porch now, drink a beer and everything is
right with the world,'' says Bullock, who hit the big time with
``Speed'' (1994), and whose next film, ``Practical Magic,'' will
open Oct. 9.
 &HT;    ``The good heat that has been on me for the last few years has
been the most frightening thing in the world,'' Bullock says.
``This instant fame is just something I couldn't understand. It
wasn't warranted, and it was for all the wrong reasons _ it was for
something that I had no control over.
 &HT;    ``I mean, who knew `Speed' was going to work? It was a movie
about an out-of-control bus.''
 &HT;    If the glitz attendant on that success, followed by the equally
big ``While You Were Sleeping'' (1995), was dazzling, so too was
the thud when ``Speed 2'' (1997) crashed at the box office.
 &HT;    ``Honestly, the best part of the last couple of years has been
the criticism I've gotten, because it's brought things back to a
more normal level,'' Bullock says. ``Now it's nice and quiet. I can
go back to scratch and start building things up again.''
 &HT;    The 33-year-old Bullock runs a hand through her long, wavy, dark
hair. Sitting in a suite at the Ritz Carlton in Pasadena, Calif.,
she is dressed simply in a long, blue dress and looks stunning.
 &HT;    The subject at hand is Griffin Dunne's ``Practical Magic,''
which puts an unusual spin on her usual girl-next-door character:
This time, the girl next door is a witch.
 &HT;    ``Believe me, I usually despise movies about witches,'' Bullock
says. ``This movie is funny, poignant, sad and really, really sick.
It's about destiny and magic, good and evil.''
 &HT;    Bullock and Nicole Kidman star as sisters who have sorcerous
powers and a family curse: Any man who falls in love with either
sister is guaranteed to die young.
 &HT;    ``I love this film,'' says Bullock, who also served as one of
its producers. ``It's one of the most unusual things I've ever been
involved with in my life. It's creative and adventurous.''
 &HT;    Bullock will also be heard from _ but not seen _ later this fall
in Dreamworks' ``The Prince of Egypt.'' She joins other stars such
as Val Kilmer (Moses), Michelle Pfeiffer and Ralph Fiennes in
providing voices for the studio's first animated project.
 &HT;    ``I have a tiny part as Miriam, Moses' sister,'' she says,
giggling. ``I kind of watch him float off. I hang by the bank of
the Nile and say, `He's coming back! He's coming back!'
 &HT;    ``I just saw a rough cut of that film,'' she adds, ``and it's an
incredible piece, a daring piece.''
 &HT;    Doing voice work is ``the hardest thing in the world,'' she
says.
 &HT;    ``I'm not good at being so animated _ pardon the pun,'' she
explains with a laugh. ``They just give you this little piece of
paper and say, `OK, let's go.' Then you're in a room just talking
to yourself.
 &HT;    ``I mean, Val was great at it,'' she says, and then stops.
``Yeah, I say Val like I know him. Michelle and Ralph were also
great, and I've never even met them in my life, so there!''
 &HT;    Unless she does a film with Kilmer, Pfeiffer or Fiennes, chances
are she won't be meeting them for a while _ unless they happen to
be down Texas way. Bullock has an aversion to the Hollywood scene,
and swears she's happier in Austin.
 &HT;    ``It's open-minded and progressive, and has a great film
community,'' she says. ``It has a lake to go swimming in. It's also
the easiest place in the world to sit outside, drink beer and
listen to great blues music.''
 &HT;    It's also the home town of Matthew McConaughey, who appeared
with Bullock in ``A Time to Kill'' (1997). The two clearly clicked
onscreen, and have been widely rumored to have done so offscreen as
well.
 &HT;    Bullock rolls her eyes, laughing.
 &HT;    ``Matthew's a great spirit, and we're not dating,'' the actress
insists. ``He's an exceptional human being, with terrific,
old-fashioned values, but he's not my boyfriend.''
 &HT;    Not that Bullock isn't ready to settle down. Actually, she says,
she's more in that mood than she's ever been before.
 &HT;    ``It's taken me a long time to be comfortable in my own skin,''
the actress says. ``I didn't want to subject my kids to a neurotic
mother. I'm neurotic enough now as it is. But I always wanted to
feel as if I could put myself second and my kids first. I'm close
to feeling that way now.''
 &HT;    It would be understandable if her interest in domesticity _ and
her retreat to Austin _ were a reaction to the failure of ``Speed
2: Cruise Control,'' which was a bigger bomb than anything Dennis
Hopper wielded in the original film. But Bullock _ who rebounded
nicely with the summer soaper, ``Hope Floats'' _ says she has only
one regret: having dragged her pal Jason Patric into the film after
``Speed'' star Keanu Reeves bailed out.
 &HT;    ``Jason spent his whole career being so selective,'' she says.
``Making a movie that turned out like `Speed 2' was his worst
nightmare.''
 &HT;    As for herself, Bullock says, there are no hard feelings.
 &HT;    ``It was a real man-against-the-elements type of shoot,'' she
says diplomatically. ``I can appreciate the experience of filming
it.
 &HT;    ``I did a lot of things I never would do,'' she explains. ``I
was out there doing something physical and dangerous every single
day _ in the storms, in the rain, in the dark. It was a great
experience.''
 &HT;    In its wake, though, Bullock is determined to take control of
her career, which means co-producing ``Hope Floats'' and
``Practical Magic.''
 &HT;    ``As an actor,'' she says, ``sometimes you feel like a throw
pillow they toss in the corner as decoration. I want to be the
architect.''
 &HT;    Even if it isn't nearly as glamorous as flashing her lightbulb
smile for the camera.
 &HT;    ``It's all dirty work,'' Bullock says. ``It's like cleaning up
the kitchen. You're not the chef _ you're the person who sets up
all the spices. I've always been good at organizing and having the
stamina to get the job done.''
 &HT;    All of which seems to add up to an actress who, at 33, has come
to terms with Hollywood, her career and her own stardom.
 &HT;    ``I'm good at putting up blinders,'' Bullock says. ``As long as
people respect my space, it's OK. If I'm buying underwear, that's
the last place I want someone to say, `Oh, I love you.'
 &HT;    ``But I've bought some good pairs of underwear lately without
interruption, so I'm happy.''

 Includes a color slide of singer Sheryl Crow. 
 By BONNIE SIEGLER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    In a culture brimming over with self-consciously angst-ridden
female rockers, Sheryl Crow is a rarity.
 &HT;    With her unique brand of guitar-driven pop songs blending
emotional honesty with gut-wrenchingly uninhibited lyrics, Crow
stands out as the real thing.
 &HT;    Her breezy 1994 hit, ``All I Wanna Do,'' made Crow a star, but
now she's hoping that it will be displaced by ``Riverwide,'' the
lead single from her third album, ``The Globe Sessions.''
 &HT;    ``After the '95 Grammys, the amount of exposure I had became a
negative in my career,'' Crow says by telephone from her newly
purchased Hollywood home. ``I think everyone became sick of Sheryl
Crow _ I actually became sick of Sheryl Crow. I wanted to go back
to being a musician who was on an upward climb, who was naive and
where everything was an innocent experience.
 &HT;    ``The older I get,'' she adds, ``and the more popular or famous
I become, the more I go back to my small-town roots. I cling to my
upbringing and am more in touch with who I am.''
 &HT;    Born in 1962 in Kennett, Mo., Crow is the daughter of a lawyer
and a piano teacher, both enthusiastic amateur musicians who played
in a weekend swing-jazz band.
 &HT;    It was her father, the singer says, who sparked her love of
words.
 &HT;    ``He was really into books,'' she recalls, ``and was constantly
reading aloud from Mark Twain's `Pudd'nhead Wilson' or `Tom
Sawyer.' There were four of us growing up, and I was the one always
eager to please my mom and dad. I loved my grandmother, too, who
was a newspaper editor.
 &HT;    ``I was raised in the Bible Belt with stern values,'' Crow says.
``My upbringing was in a small town where everybody knew everybody
else _ the heartland of America, which really hasn't changed that
much.''
 &HT;    After high school, Crow attended the University of Missouri,
then moved to St. Louis to teach elementary school.
 &HT;    But her nights were filled with music, singing with a variety of
local rock bands. In 1987, she moved to Los Angeles, and found work
providing backup vocals for such top stars as Michael Jackson, Don
Henley and Rod Stewart.
 &HT;    ``Every time you go and work with anybody of this stature _ or
maybe anybody, for that matter _ you pick up and learn different
things if you are open to it,'' she says.
 &HT;    The record that became her 1993 debut, ``Tuesday Night Music
Club,'' sold a hefty 8 million copies. Her self-titled second album
came in 1996, and included ``Love Is A Good Thing,'' an anti-gun
song which criticized the availability of firearms at Wal-Mart
stores. The chain banned the album, but Crow didn't back down, and
the song became a hit.
 &HT;    While proud of ``Love Is A Good Thing,'' the song Crow hopes to
be remembered for is ``Riverwide.''
 &HT;    ``It's a career song,'' the singer says. ``It's probably the
most honest song I've ever written.
 &HT;    ``It tells my own feelings about what's happened over the past
few years,'' she says, ``the changes in my life and the changes in
me personally: `I spent a year in the mouth of a whale/with a flame
and a book of signs./You'll never know how hard I've failed,/trying
to make up for lost time.'''
 &HT;    Those changes include a surprising discovery _ the 36-year-old's
longing for a family of her own.
 &HT;    ``I've had a great life and have enjoyed my creative career,''
she says, ``but career is a big sacrifice to make for a family, and
I'm not really sure I can live with that in the end.''
 &HT;    Crow, who maintains homes in Los Angeles and in New York _ site
of her Globe Studios, after which her latest album is named _ is
coy in discussing her romantic life or lack of same.
 &HT;    ``I think love adds to everything,'' she says evasively. ``I'm
an old softie about that. I think a loving relationship is the most
important thing in life. If you don't have one, you're always
looking for one. It's the big motivator and the driver.''
 &HT;    She'll admit to only one love in her life, though.
 &HT;    ``I have a golden lab, Scout, who goes everywhere with me,'' the
singer says. ``He's always with me and a great leveler, which I
can't always say about a man.''
 &HT;    Relationship woes appear frequently in ``The Globe Sessions,''
especially in the single, ``My Favorite Mistake.'' The mid-tempo
tune refers to ``the obvious,'' she says. ``Everyone looks back on
their lives and sees relationships they've had that they knew going
into were not going to be conducive to a healthy coupling. But you
just do it, and looking back you say, `Well, I'd probably do it
again.' We all have one of those.''
 &HT;    Originally, ``The Globe Sessions'' was to be titled
``Riverwide.'' That changed when Crow received a call from Bob
Dylan, a personal friend, who asked if he could contribute a song
to her album.
 &HT;    ``I still have strong ties to Bob, we have an excellent
relationship,'' she says. ``I thought having Bob record was
important. When his song, `Mississippi,' was done, I felt the album
was better suited not to have a signature song be the title.''
 &HT;    Hopefully, Crow says, the new album will also return the focus
to her work, rather than her personal image.
 &HT;    ``A lot of people seem to get preoccupied with what I'm
wearing,'' she says, ``as opposed to the music.
 &HT;    ``I think when you have what seems to be out-of-control press
exposure and the amount of negative vs. positive, you react to
it,'' the singer says. ``Whether it's in your everyday life when
you let off steam, or putting on a pair of leopard, skintight pants
with more makeup.
 &HT;    ``I could never make apologies for that,'' Crow says, ``because
that was who I was at the time. I didn't feel like being the girl
next door anymore. I really opened myself up to the press and
criticism. I allowed them to be my therapists in many ways.
 &HT;    ``So my second album was reactionary to everything going down,
to having my life analyzed in every magazine,'' she concludes.
``I'm trying to establish more balance in my life now.''
 &HT;    In other words, the wild, hard-partying Sheryl Crow is a thing
of the past, at least to some extent.
 &HT;    ``I find that I much more enjoy clarity,'' the singer says,
``and it's not the clarity I miss out on when I'm drinking _ it's
the clarity I miss out on the next morning, when I'm feeling hung
over.
 &HT;    ``I still struggle with it,'' she admits, ``because there's a
big part of myself that still likes that whole escapist,
out-of-your head thing.''
 &HT;    For the time being, she isn't planning to tour to promote ``The
Globe Sessions.''
 &HT;    ``No, I'm pulling back in my life,'' she says. ``The last time I
came off the road, I looked around me and thought about half my
life was gone. I'm trying to exist with balance.''
 &HT;    In this case, balance includes branching out from singing and
songwriting. She recently produced three songs on Stevie Nicks'
next album, and also took a small acting role in ``The Minus Man''
with Dwight Yoakam and Janeane Garofalo. She's also writing music
for a film comedy.
 &HT;    ``But I really couldn't tell you what I'll be doing next week or
next year,'' she says. ``I do have typical days, though, just like
everyone else _ get up, drink some coffee and do a crossword
puzzle.''

 Includes a color slide of Leelee Sobieski with Anthony Roth
Costanzo in a scene from ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries.'' 
 By JEANNE WOLF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Let's get the two obvious questions about Leelee Sobieski out of
the way:
 &HT;    To begin with, it's a nickname _ short for Liliane.
 &HT;    Next, she's 16 _ 16 going on 30, that is, a beguiling mix of
teen-age enthusiasm and wisdom beyond her years.
 &HT;    Sitting on the set of her latest movie, ``Never Been Kissed,''
in which she co-stars with Drew Barrymore, the fresh-faced blonde
gives her long hair a toss as she chatters with adolescent abandon
about her life and career.
 &HT;    And it's a serious career: She married Elijah Wood in ``Deep
Impact'' (1998). Now she's about to be seen in ``A Soldier's
Daughter Never Cries,'' directed by James Ivory and opening Oct. 2.
Sobieski even has a part in the much-anticipated, seemingly
never-finished ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' from legendary director Stanley
Kubrick.
 &HT;    James Ivory. Stanley Kubrick. Not to mention co-stars such as
Barrymore, Wood, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
 &HT;    Sobieski shrugs.
 &HT;    ``I'm not intimidated so easily,'' she says with a grin. ``I
just go for it _ being in a major movie doesn't scare me.''
 &HT;    Sobieski's father is a French painter who had a brief acting
career in his youth, and her mother is a writer who is currently
working on a script for her. But she insists that neither tried to
interest her in acting.
 &HT;    ``If my parents had pushed me into it, I wouldn't be doing it,''
she says emphatically, ``and I wouldn't tell you that I love it.''
 &HT;    Instead, Sobieski, who lives on Manhattan's Upper West Side, was
discovered when she was 10 by a casting director who spotted her in
her school cafeteria.
 &HT;    ``She was on the board of trustees of the school, and I didn't
know she was watching me,'' Sobieski recalls. ``Then she sent this
note home, `If your daughter would like to try out for a film,
please go to this-and-this place.'
 &HT;    ``I always wanted to be a painter or a writer,'' she says, ``so
I was really surprised. But I said, `OK, why not an actress? Try
it.'
 &HT;    ``I did horrible in my audition,'' she adds. ``I was really,
really bad. I didn't understand anything, but I was sort of
interested in the idea of getting to play all these different
characters, so I went to an acting coach and tried again.''
 &HT;    Her third audition won Sobieski her first part, with Marlo
Thomas in the television movie ``Reunion.'' She followed that with
several more television movies and series guest shots, before
making her big-screen debut as Martin Short's daughter in ``Jungle
2 Jungle'' (1997).
 &HT;    ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries'' is based on a memoir by
Kaylie Jones, daughter of James Jones, who wrote ``The Thin Red
Line'' and ``From Here to Eternity.'' Sobieski plays the daughter,
from her expatriate-childhood days in Paris to a culture-shocking
relocation to Long Island as a teen-ager, with Kris Kristofferson
as her father the writer.
 &HT;    ``He's so cool,'' she gushes. ``Most of the time he dressed all
in black. Kris is very much a family man in real life, just like
the character he plays. He has seven kids, and he brought five of
them with him on location, both in Paris and North Carolina.
 &HT;    ``He's like a big block who just holds his whole family
together,'' Sobieski says. ``But he's cool. He's not afraid to
curse in front of them if he feels like it or anything.''
 &HT;    Having a French father, Sobieski says, she found the French
scenes relatively easy, though her accent was a problem.
 &HT;    ``I had been going to camp in the south of France every
summer,'' she explains, ``so my accent was sort of southern French
with a twang to it. I had to get rid of that.''
 &HT;    She didn't have trouble with the close relationship between her
character and Kristofferson's, either.
 &HT;    ``I've always been close to my father,'' she says. ``It's funny,
though, now I think I'm getting closer to my mother. For awhile I
was sort of the stereotypical teen-ager who'd fight with my mother
and run to dad.
 &HT;    ``I tell them both everything, and my father tries to be really
cool with me,'' she adds with a laugh. ``But behind my back he'll
say to my mother, `Don't ever let her do that again.' So my mother
gets to be the bad guy.''
 &HT;    On the other hand, Sobieski says, she had difficulty with sex
scenes, especially one in which, as a high-school student, she and
a boyfriend have sex in a car.
 &HT;    ``I was just extremely intimidated,'' she recalls. ``I said to
Harley Cross, who was playing my boyfriend, `You just do everything
and I'll follow along.'
 &HT;    ``And he said, `How old are you?' When I told him I was 15, he
was kidding me, `Oh my God, I'm 21. They're going to send me to
jail for doing this scene with you.'
 &HT;    ``Anyway, it came out all right,'' she says. ``But I had never
done that sort of thing on camera, much less in real life. It was
sort of a growing-up moment for me personally, which was sort of
scary.''
 &HT;    Sex is the subject matter of ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' but Kubrick's
notorious secrecy keeps Sobieski from knowing anything more, even
after a two-week shoot which wound up taking two months.
 &HT;    ``I'd be sitting in makeup,'' she says, ``and I'd see a photo of
a hairdo for another actor or actress _ and they'd hide it from me
and say, `You can't see that.'
 &HT;    ``And I'd go, `But I'm in the movie.' And they'd say, `Sorry,
it's confidential.'
 &HT;    ``But I got to work with Stanley Kubrick,'' she says, ``so why
should I care?''
 &HT;    Working with Cruise, on the other hand, was an unambiguous
delight, Sobieski says.
 &HT;    ``I love him,'' she says simply. ``He was so down-to-earth. The
first day that I met him, he gave me and my mom both a big kiss on
the cheek. He's so warm and wonderful, and so in love with his
wife, Nicole.
 &HT;    ``In one scene I had to wear high heels,'' she adds with a
smile. ``Stanley said to Tom, `How do you feel about Leelee wearing
heels, because it's going to make her taller than you?' And Tom
said, `I love heels. They make women's legs look so sexy.' He was
just a great guy.''
 &HT;    Actually, Sobieski admits to having a crush on most of her
co-stars.
 &HT;    ``Whenever I play somebody's girlfriend,'' she says, ``I don't
know if it's method acting or what, but I really end up liking
them. I guess I just make myself like them, but it's sort of fun.''
 &HT;    Offscreen, Sobieski says she isn't seeing anyone special, though
she's still in touch with one of her co-stars from ``A Soldier's
Daughter,'' Anthony Roth Costanzo. Like her, he lives in New York.
 &HT;    ``He's, like, one of my best friends,'' she says. ``He's on the
Upper West Side in the 80s. We just like to meet and maybe go to
lunch or dinner somewhere. Afterward, we just walk around and talk.
 &HT;    ``You know what the last thing we did together was?'' she says,
laughing. ``We bought a potato gun _ you put grated potato pellets
into it and shoot them out. So we were standing in the middle of
the sidewalk shooting our potato gun. We didn't shoot people _ we'd
aim at car tires or I'd hit Anthony. It was a blast.''
 &HT;    Suddenly every bit a teen-ager, Sobieski gives her hair another

THE FREAKINESS OF BEING JOHN LEGUIZAMO

 Includes a color slide of John Leguizamo in a scene from ``John
Leguizamo: Freak.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    We aren't talking inhibitions here.
 &HT;    On stage in such one-man shows as ``Mambo Mouth,''
``Spic-O-Rama'' and ``Freak,'' John Leguizamo reveals himself to
the world. Warts and all.
 &HT;    ``I'm an exhibitionist,'' he says. ``I need to do it. It's like
some kind of dance, some kind of emotional enema. It helps me purge
myself.
 &HT;    ``I feel that all great art _ and I aspire to that, whether or
not I reach it _ is personal,'' the Latino actor says. ``Richard
Pryor always got personal and intimate, and Eugene O'Neill always
dealt with things that were personal.
 &HT;    ``It's the personal art that stands out the most and is the most
touching.''
 &HT;    Leguizamo's brand of personal art often finds him in a darkened
theater, a wiry, speed-talking figure stalking the stage as he
unleashes semiautobiographical tales in a combination of
performance-art monologue, character portrayal and stand-up comedy.
 &HT;    His usual topics _ sex, life as a Latino, harsh memories of his
childhood _ elicit intense audience reaction ranging from empathy
to embarrassment, nervous laughter to anger.
 &HT;    On Oct. 10, the actor will be talking to a bigger house than
usual, as HBO airs ``John Leguizamo: Freak,'' an adaptation of his
recent one-man Broadway show, which earned 1998 Tony Award
nominations for Best Play and Best Actor. Directed by Spike Lee and
filmed before a live audience, the 90-minute-long special pretty
much re-creates the stage show.
 &HT;    ```Freak' is without monologues and costumes, and it's about me,
not characters,'' the 34-year-old Leguizamo says during a telephone
conversation from his home in Manhattan. ``It's got a first, second
and third act, so it's really different from what I've done before.
 &HT;    ``But there's no difference in my performance because we were
doing it for HBO,'' he adds. ``Spike shot it, and he and I talked
about how we wanted it to look, because I wanted it to look like
`Woodstock' (1970).
 &HT;    ``We taped it mostly in one night, with seven cameras,'' he
recalls. ``I didn't mind if there were flaws, if you saw the
cameras. I wanted it to feel live, like it was the only chance to
capture the moment.''
 &HT;    Over the years, Lee has taken public swipes at white filmmakers
who presume to make movies about the African-American experience,
arguing that only African-Americans should handle such projects.
But Leguizamo says he doesn't worry about his Latin audience
slamming him for not hiring a Latino director.
 &HT;    ``I think Hispanic people will be happy that `Freak' got
documented by anybody,'' he says. ``I don't think we'll have
letters or picketers.
 &HT;    ``Besides,'' he adds, ``Spike has a right to say whatever he
thinks.''
 &HT;    Anyhow, Leguizamo has more important criticism to worry about.
During ``Freak's'' run on Broadway, his family complained publicly
about the show's rough depiction of them and of his upbringing.
Nevertheless, Leguizamo says, he didn't alter a word for the HBO
presentation.
 &HT;    ``They'll be even more upset, now that a larger group of people
will see the show,'' Leguizamo says, sounding almost pleased at the
prospect. ``And, because it will be on video, it'll be permanent.
 &HT;    ``But I've bought them a lot of gifts and promised them all
houses someday.''
 &HT;    Leguizamo's accustomed to generating controversy. Like Chris
Rock, who takes a beating from the African-American community for
picking on blacks, the Colombia-born Leguizamo gets flak from
Hispanics for his portrayal of his own people.
 &HT;    And, also like Rock, Leguizamo makes no apologies.
 &HT;    ``Whenever you decide to be opinionated, to have your own ideas
and be outspoken, you're going to be attacked, going to be
crucified,'' he says. ``If you're not portraying people the way
they want to be seen, if you're showing all the skeletons in the
closet, these guardians of the culture _ these quasi-intellectuals
who want to be seen in only one light _ don't like it.
 &HT;    ``I say to them, `I gotta do what I gotta do, and you do what
you gotta do.' Nobody's going to stop me.''
 &HT;    Beyond the stage, Leguizamo has a second life in movies, as a
character actor who has forged a career as one of those faces you
recognize but can't quite place. His film credits include ``Die
Hard 2'' (1990), ``Carlito's Way'' (1993), ``To Wong Foo, Thanks
for Everything, Julie Newmar'' (1995), ``William Shakespeare's
Romeo &AMP; Juliet'' (1996) and ``Spawn'' (1997), as well as the
excruciating ``Super Mario Bros.'' (1993) and ``The Pest'' (1997),
the latter of which he co-produced and co-wrote.
 &HT;    Leguizamo most recently provided the voice of the rat in the
current box-office hit ``Doctor Dolittle,'' and has wrapped two
upcoming films: Spike Lee's ``Summer of Sam'' and ``Pleasant View
Avenue,'' which Leguizamo stars in and executive produced via his
company, Lower East Side Films.
 &HT;    It's been reported in the press that Leguizamo will appear in
``Summer of Sam'' as David Berkowitz, the ``Son of Sam'' killer who
briefly terrorized New York in the 1970s. The actor denies it,
however.
 &HT;    ``The film's about two best friends (Leguizamo and Adrien Brody)
in this neighborhood when the `Summer of Sam' hits the block,'' he
says. ``The `Son of Sam' murders are a backdrop. Disco and punk
music have hit Manhattan, and it's one of the hottest summers ever.
 &HT;    ``It's a clash of all that and how it destroys a friendship, how
differences destroy people.''
 &HT;    Leguizamo, Val Kilmer and Ethan Hawke star in ``Pleasant View
Avenue,'' an independent drama written and directed by the actor
Frank Whaley.
 &HT;    ```Pleasant View Avenue' was a script I read and fell in love
with,'' Leguizamo says. ``To me, it was a lot like `Freak' _ it's
about two little brothers growing up with a tough, abusive father.
I wanted to help get it done, because I thought Frank had an
incredible story to tell.''
 &HT;    In October, Leguizamo will begin work on a drama entitled ``King
of the Jungle,'' in which he'll play a retarded man struggling to
understand his relationship with his father. Though the role of the
father has yet to be cast, Annabella Sciorra and Rosie Perez will
also appear in the film.
 &HT;    If you ask about Leguizamo in Hollywood, they'll tell you he's a
reliable professional, with a good work ethic and admirable credits
with some of today's most respected directors. If you ask about him
in New York, they'll tell you he's a wild man, crazy, bouncing off
the walls.
 &HT;    Actually, the actor says, both are parts of the real John
Leguizamo.
 &HT;    ``I have low-key moments,'' he says, ``and at other times I'm
out of control _ I'm sort of like Jekyll and Hyde around the house.
I'm not crazy all the time, but when I am my friends can tolerate
it.''
 &HT;    So far, he's never been able to fuse the two, finding a
big-screen opportunity to express the wild creativity that New York
audiences know him for. He hopes the HBO special will help, but
doesn't expect miracles overnight.
 &HT;    ``I'm working toward having creative autonomy in films,'' he
says. ``It's a much more difficult thing to have in films, because
there's so much more money involved. I think I'll get my chance
next year.''
 &HT;    Leguizamo pauses.
 &HT;    ``It's really hard, and it's about luck in a lot of ways,'' he
says. ``If you do a role that hits really huge, you have more power
_ and that's just the luck of the draw.
 &HT;    ``I'm heading toward doing on film what I do on stage, which is
to create the whole thing myself,'' Leguizamo says, ``I think I
needed to do other films, to learn more about film, before I did
that.''

AD AGENCIES SAY POLITICAL COMMERCIALS NEED PROFESSIONAL HELP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Political campaigns in California will spend
some $100 million, the brunt of it for television commercials, in
the run-up to the Nov. 3 election, according to one consultant.
</P>
<P>
   But some in the commercial advertising industry say candidates
and supporters of ballot initiatives will not necessarily get the
return on their huge investment if the forces behind the
advertisements are campaign consultants and not industry
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Ray McNally, with McNally Temple Associates Inc. in Sacramento,
estimates that $100 million will be spent by candidates and
initiative campaigns, with as much as 80 percent of it pegged for
television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Political consultants like McNally _ who is managing campaigns
for three Republican congressional candidates as well as the
Proposition 1A school bond initiative _ have over the past two
decades strengthened their role in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of presidential races, when creative
advertising counselors are brought in for image-shaping, the
consultants have a lock on the political advertising market.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Gardner, who heads the Gardner Geary Coll &AMP; Young
advertising firm in Maiden Lane, is arguing that commercial,
product-oriented ad agencies should have a share of the lucrative
market _ in the name of quality.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner and other prominent advertisers are decrying the
``shameless similarity'' of ads, particularly biographical spots,
produced by political consultants. They add that the mean-spirited
tone of negative campaign ads denigrates all advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner, in an article in the July 6 issue of Advertising Age,
referred to his experiences advising Republican presidential
candidates and working with their consultants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bring us in because we know how to build brands and
persuade people through humor, emotion and other skills. And they
know that we respect their political savvy, insight and
experience,'' wrote Gardner, whose firm has $50 million in annual
billings and a client list that includes toy-maker Fisher-Price.
</P>
<P>
   What prompted him to write the article, he said, was the failed
campaign of Al Checchi, who spent a record $40 million in the
Democratic gubernatorial primary and got 13 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner wrote that Checchi, who as president of Northwest
Airlines ``presumably would have deep-sixed his agency for running
formula ads that aped his competitors', had no problem spending his
own money on political ads that were mostly reruns of tired
political formats we've all seen millions of times.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians, said Gardner, could benefit from what ad industry
executives call ``great creative,'' which translates to ``as good
as it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps record political spending in California, ``with its
dismal results,'' Gardner wrote in Advertising Age, will cause
candidates and consultants to stop spending good money on bad
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner, who has served as an advertising adviser in the
presidential campaigns of Gerald Ford, George Bush and Bob Dole,
said ad quality suffers in campaigns for the U.S. Senate on down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is between some B movie and a great movie,''
Gardner said in an interview, referring to the difference in most
political consultants' television commercials and those produced by
industry executives. ``Some of it is production value, the emotion,
the seamlessness of the fit, the message, as opposed to something
that is crafted in the basement of a TV studio.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians have another view.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, the problem may be that politicians try to make
themselves too much like commercial products,'' said former Lt.
Gov. Leo McCarthy. ``What is the purpose here? Is it just to make
it an attractive looking ad or is it to inform the public? Keep in
mind, this is not like advertising Coca-Cola, which has an on-going
ad base. Politics is short, very focused. To compete with all the
commercial advertising you have to punch through.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Usually, we try to make the opponent bleed.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner's standard for great political advertising is President
Lyndon Johnson's classic 1964 political ad in which a girl plucks
the petals of a daisy and counts down from 10 to an atomic blast,
as well as the ``Morning Again in America'' commercial produced for
Ronald Reagan's re-election campaign in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The ad industry believes poor political commercials have tainted
its image, said Jerry Gibbons, West Coast representative for the
American Association of Advertising Agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commercial ads have rules and regulations mostly revolving
around truth and political ads are exempt from those same rules,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The price for advertising is enormous.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 5, the state initiative to relax restrictions on
Indian gaming, will likely be the most costly this time around _
$75 million. The California tribes have said they may spend $50
million to get the measure approve, and opponents say they plan to
spend $25 million, mostly on TV commercials.
</P>
<P>
   McNally noted that gubernatorial candidates Dan Lungren and Gray
Davis likely will each spend $20 million. Senate candidates Barbara
Boxer and Matt Fong may each spend $10 million. Another $10 million
will be spent on congressional contests and millions more will be
spent on state-level legislative races.
</P>
<P>
   In all of this, there will be ``moments of advertising
brilliance surrounded by a lot of mediocrity,'' McNally said.

ELECTION REPRESENTS A `NEW BEGINNING' FOR GERMANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BONN, Germany _ With an astonishing boldness, Germans have
ushered in a new phase in their political life, one their newly
elected leader, Gerhard Schroeder, on Monday called the ``Berlin
Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   In a literal sense, the phrase merely signifies the planned
return of the German capital to Berlin next year, 54 years after
the collapse of Hitler's Reich. But Schroeder, whose Social
Democrats inflicted a crushing defeat on Chancellor Helmut Kohl on
Sunday, said the birth of the ``Berlin Republic'' had a deeper
meaning for him.
</P>
<P>
   It represented a ``new beginning,'' he said, one combining the
strong German democratic culture built up over the past
half-century with the ``civil courage shown in the unification of
this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The allusion to reunification was telling, for in the difficult,
hugely expensive marriage of the West and the formerly Communist
East lay the seeds of Schroeder's sweeping victory.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, shaken by the high unemployment engendered partly by
reunification, has shifted leftward; it has also shifted eastward
away from conservative Rhineland culture of Kohl and the first
post-war chancellor Konrad Adenauer toward as yet untried forms of
government.
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, Germany will now be governed for the first
time by a ``Red-Green'' coalition, bringing together the Social
Democrats and the environmentalist Greens. This in turn will mean
important shifts _ away from the restrictive immigration laws that
have shaped many Germans' view of their society, toward possible
new ``ecology taxes'' on energy, and against a complete
deregulation of Germany's ``social market'' economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The core of the Bonn republic was Christian, Catholic,
south-western,'' said Claus Leggewie, a political scientist. ``The
center of gravity has now moved east, where the electorate is
completely different, opening up political options that never
existed before.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, those options will be limited by Germany's strong
commitment to the NATO alliance and to the European Union. But from
an essentially conservative state, Germany seems likely to become a
cautiously experimental one.
</P>
<P>
   In the former East, support for Kohl's Christian Democrats
imploded. The party won about 27.3 percent of the vote, down from
37.5 percent in 1994. At the same time, support for Schroeder's
Social Democrats and the Party of Democratic Socialism, the
successor to the East German Communist Party, surged.
</P>
<P>
   Against the prediction of most people, including themselves, the
Social Democrats and the Greens won a clear majority in the
Bundestag, or parliament.
</P>
<P>
   A government of the two parties would embody the arrival in
power of a post-war generation that took part in the wave of
leftist protests of the 1960s _ Joschka Fischer, the Greens' most
influential single figure was particularly active _ and
subsequently evolved toward the pragmatism that was the hallmark of
Schroeder's victory.
</P>
<P>
   But if realism has tempered the idealism of youth in the case of
both Schroeder and Fischer, a ``Red-Green'' German government would
still represent a radical departure.

 BONN, Germany: radical departure.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Monday, Schroeder warned that the Greens should prepare
themselves for ``tough negotiations,'' and he is certain to rein in
their most extremist wing, known as the ``Fundis.'' Nonetheless,
policy will shift.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Schroeder and Fischer made clear on Monday,
Germany's immigration laws seem certain to change, reflecting the
extent to which this has become a multi-ethnic society. ``We will
make it possible to have dual citizenship,'' Schroeder said. ``We
will find a solution to this.''
</P>
<P>
   This reform, strongly supported by the Greens and resisted by
the Christian Democrats, would probably make it possible for
immigrants' children born in Germany to gain citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 7 million foreigners in Germany. Such a
change in the law would represent a marked shift away from
Christian Democrat vision of Germany as a place rooted in the
``homogeneity'' of the German people. This view was held with a
relentless conviction against the mounting evidence to the
contrary.
</P>
<P>
   On the treacherous economic front, the Social Democrats and the
Greens will certainly find it more difficult to harmonize their
positions. One Green leader, Juergen Trittin, on Monday called for
the closure, as fast as possible, of Germany's 20 nuclear power
stations _ a demand Schroeder will regard as unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the two parties are likely to be united in a desire to
preserve at least the bedrock of Germany's and Europe's welfare
system against more extreme free-market reforms inspired by Ronald
Reagan or Margaret Thatcher. In this sense, they will stand against
the wholesale ``Americanization'' of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Both Oskar Lafontaine, the chairman of the Social Democratic
Party and probably the next finance minister, and Fischer, who may
become foreign minister, are adamant about the defense of minimum
social, ecological and welfare standards against the complete
deregulation that global markets have tended to inspire.
</P>
<P>
   But the central issue confronting the parties _ Germany's 4.1
million unemployed _ is certain to provoke tensions. The Greens
want to lower Germany's high wage costs, one of the main barriers
to employment, with taxes on energy, including gasoline, to
discourage the use of cars while raising money to defray employers'
social welfare costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Democrats, meanwhile, have wavered between assurances
to businessmen about lowering taxes and making the labor market
less rigid and pledges to workers about improved pensions and sick
pay.
</P>
<P>
   This tension is symbolized by the likely presence in the
government of Lafontaine at the finance ministry and the self-made
millionaire businessman, Jost Stollmann, at the economics ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder confirmed Monday that Stollmann, who is deeply suspect
to the average Social Democratic party member, would be in the
cabinet _ a declaration clearly aimed at reassuring businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   But Hans-Olaf Henkel, the president of the Federation of Germany
Industry, bitterly attacked the Greens' proposals for ecological
taxes and an end to nuclear power, and said industry was
``certainly nervous'' about a ``Red-Green'' coalition.
</P>
<P>
   On one point, the Social Democrats and Greens do agree. Both
want to call a conference bringing together employers and labor
unions to discuss a program to create jobs, perhaps through pledges
of wage restraint from unions against pledges of jobs from
employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot bring down unemployment against the will of the
employers or without the cooperation of the unions,'' Fischer said.
``We have to work with both.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a remark typical of the post-war German quest for
consensus, the very essence of the long formidable ``social market
economy'' that propelled the country from post-war ruin to great
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   If a radical shift to a new ``Berlin Republic'' is underway, it
is equally clear that there will also be strong elements of
continuity and compromise under the new generation now set to
govern Europe's most powerful state.

CALIFORNIA MOVES ITS PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY TO EARLY MARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., Wash.)  (lh) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a bid to give the nation's most populous state
more say about presidential nominees, including perhaps himself,
Gov. Pete Wilson Monday signed a bill that would move all statewide
primaries here to the first Tuesday in March, three months ahead of
the old June date.
</P>
<P>
   California has not been critical in choosing a major party's
nominee since 1972, but along with New York and most of the New
England states, which have already set their primaries for early
March, California will now be among the handful of states whose
elections immediately follow the New Hampshire primary and Iowa
caucuses in the presidential contests of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``If voters were home runs, California would be Mark McGwire and
Sammy Sosa put together,'' Wilson, a Republican who is barred from
seeking a third term this year, said in signing the bill at a
ceremony in Sacramento. ``But the current primary process treats us
like we can't hit our weight.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the state Democratic Party, former state Sen.
Art Torres, chose a groundhog metaphor to celebrate, declaring that
``California's shadow is now on the snows of New Hampshire's
presidential primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors of the measure here have urged Oregon and Washington
state to move their presidential primaries to the same date, March
7, to create a giant ``West Coast primary'' that would account for
nearly a quarter of the votes needed to select the Democratic
Party's nominee and just over a fifth of those needed to choose a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Oregon moved its primary from May to the second Tuesday
in March, but election officials there said Monday they knew of no
plan to move the primary even earlier. In 1996, Washington moved
its primary to March 26, also from May, and now its secretary of
state, Ralph Munro, has asked the official commission that sets the
primary date to make it coincide with California's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our underlying goal is to have a system that will act as a
magnet that will bring candidates to the Pacific Northwest to learn
about our issues and concerns,'' said David Brine, a spokesman for
the secretary of state's office. Critics of the early primary plan
have contended that it would require candidates to wage a brutally
brief, bi-coastal campaign in which only the best-financed hopefuls
in each party could hope to compete.
</P>
<P>
   But the move could help Wilson, whose support for abortion
rights makes him an anathema to many of the conservative Republican
voters who dominate the primary process around the nation. With
California at the front end of the process, along with New England
states where Wilson's advisers believe he might have appeal, Wilson
could stand a stronger chance, though he would also face stiff
competition here, especially among Hispanic voters, from Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wilson's brief run for the presidency in 1996 collapsed for lack
of financing and support, and he even lost his voice temporarily
following throat surgery. He has said he would run again only if he
decided he could raise enough money, but he has made no secret of
his desire to do so. Beyond that, a recent Los Angeles Times poll
found that the state's economic recovery has lifted the governor's
popularity to record levels, though two-thirds of voters still say
Wilson should not seek the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that California has tried to increase
its standing in the presidential sweepstakes. In 1996, it moved its
primary from June to the end of March, but even then found itself
an afterthought in the race for the Republican nomination because
other states also moved up their primaries. To curtail efforts at
leapfrogging, both national parties have adopted rules to
discourage primaries earlier than the first week of March, except
for New Hampshire's, which has long been first.
</P>
<P>
   At the insistence of Democrats in the state Assembly, the new
measure here moves not only the presidential primary, but all
statewide primaries, allowing challengers in races for governor and
U.S. senator considerably more time to undertake campaigns than the
current five-month general election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate but related move this year, Wilson signed
legislation that exempts presidential primaries in the state from a
ballot measure passed two years ago that required primary election
ballots to list all candidates together, regardless of party, in a
so-called ``blanket'' primary. National party rules bar selecting
delegates to nominating conventions in that way, so voters will be
asked to approve the exemption in another ballot measure this fall.
Otherwise, the state parties here would have to devise some kind of
closed caucus or state convention system in which actual delegates
would be selected, after a primary that would be a mere beauty
contest.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With 26 donors already giving or pledging at least $1
million each, and one as much as $25 million, the Metropolitan
Opera has opened its largest endowment campaign ever, aimed at more
than doubling its nest egg to $400 million over the next three
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the $200 million goal has already been raised or
promised, said James W. Kinnear, chairman of the Met board and the
campaign. Kinnear is also a former president of Texaco Inc., which
has pledged $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the fund-raising drive was keyed to a gala
dinner Monday night after the season-opening production of ``Samson
et Dalila'' honoring Placido Domingo on the 30th anniversary of his
Met debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be seeing each and every one of you,'' Kinnear,
interviewed before the dinner, said he wanted to tell benefactors,
who already give $65 million a year to close the gap between
operating expenses of $165 million and ticket sales and other
revenue of about $100 million. ``You don't get this kind of money a
dollar at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   By almost any measure, the 115-year-old company is in enviable
artistic and financial shape, selling 92 percent of its seats on
average and renewing a record 88 percent of annual subscriptions at
a difficult time for many companies in the arts.
</P>
<P>
   But with the present endowment of $171 million, barely equal to
a year's expenses, ``there is tremendous pressure on annual
fund-raising,'' said Joseph Volpe, the Met's general manager.
</P>
<P>
   The larger endowment, he said, would yield greater interest
income to stabilize ticket prices, help cushion the Met against
economic downturns and provide the financial security to continue
the company's broadcasts, tours, free outdoor concerts and youth
programs. The money would mean ``even greater successes to share
with our public,'' Volpe said.
</P>
<P>
   The largest gift so far is coming from Alberto W. Vilar, an
investor in computer and medical technology who grew up in Cuba and
Puerto Rico and has quietly become one of the most generous
benefactors in the Met's history.
</P>
<P>
   Vilar, founder, president and portfolio manager of Amerindo
Investment Advisers Inc., which manages nearly $3 billion in growth
stocks, is committed to giving the endowment $20 million over five
years plus another $5 million in challenge grants that match
contributions by others. In response, the Met has renamed the
concert hall's grand-tier level for him. Vilar is a member of the
Met's managing board and a vice chairman of the endowment campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year he has also underwritten three Met productions _
``La Cenerentola'' last season and ``Le Nozze di Figaro'' and ``La
Traviata'' this season _ and agreed to pay for two more in future
seasons _ ``Doktor Faust'' and ``Fidelio'' _ for a total of almost
$9 million. He also donates $250,000 annually to the circle of
large givers known as the Golden Horseshoe and larger amounts to
the Met's Young Artist Development Program. Additionally, he gave
$1.5 million to the Salzburg Festival and other contributions to
the Kirov Opera, and $10 million to the new Vilar Center for the
Arts at the Beaver Creek ski resort in Avon, Colo., among other
musical and nonmusical causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love opera,'' he said recently in an interview in his firm's
conference room, lighted by a copy of the Met's Lobmeyr crystal
chandeliers.
</P>
<P>
   Vilar's past gifts and future commitments to the Met amount to
nearly $40 million, putting him in the league of Sybil Harrington,
the Texas oil heiress and philanthropist regarded as the Met's
greatest individual donor, who died this month in Phoenix at 89.
Beginning in the 1970s, she gave more than $30 million, including a
$20 million gift to the last endowment campaign in 1980, which had
a $100 million goal.
</P>
<P>
   Other significant donors have been Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, the
wife of John D. Rockefeller Jr.; J. William Fisher, through his
Gramma Fisher Foundation; Lila Acheson Wallace; and Francis Goelet,
who died this year and left the Met a bequest yet to be evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   Major donors to the new endowment campaign include the
telecommunications entrepreneur George Lindemann and his wife,
Frayda, a musicologist ($10 million) and the C.V. Starr Foundation
($5 million). Other large unspecified gifts came from the
investment banker Ezra K. Zilkha and his wife, Cecile, and William
C. Morris, chairman of the Wall Street money management firm, J. &AMP;
W. Seligman &AMP; Co., and his wife, Susan.
</P>
<P>
   The Lindemanns earmarked their gift for the Met's young artists
program, which pays three-year stipends to about a dozen singers at
a time to study and work at the Met. The program has been renamed
the Lindemann Young Artist Development Program. ``The Metropolitan
Opera has been an important part of our lives for many years,''
said Mrs. Lindemann, a pianist and former Hunter College music
teacher. ``We're honored and thrilled to be in a position to
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the $10 million gift from Texaco will support a new city
school program that exposes children to opera and uses music to
help develop educational skills. Texaco is the Met's most
identifiable backer, having sponsored nearly 59 years of Saturday
afternoon radio broadcasts for about $150 million.

 NEW YORK: about $150 million. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The announcement of the endowment campaign and the large gifts
comes two weeks after the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts,
of which the Met is a part, announced its largest gift, a $25
million unrestricted contribution from Julian H. Robertson Jr., a
hedge fund investor. The fountain plaza was then named for his
wife, Josie.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Met said the timing of the two gifts was
coincidental. Marilyn Shapiro, the Met's executive director for
external affairs, said the pattern of giving, notwithstanding the
Vilar gift, had not changed appreciably in recent years.
Three-quarters of contributions come from individuals and a quarter
from institutions. Government contributions are well under $1
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   A third of the contributors are from outside New York, as are
six of the 26 $1 million-plus givers to the endowment. ``We're not
limited to the geography we serve,'' Ms. Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
   Like a big trust fund for a struggling wage-earner, a large
endowment for an institution is a godsend, producing steady
interest income. As long as the principal is untouched and
investments appreciate, the money keeps growing. But to create a
big endowment, an institution often must turn to the same
benefactors who make annual contributions, in effect picking the
same pockets twice.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is to create a new income stream while not risking the
old. The payoff is that once a significant endowment is
established, the reliance on annual contributions diminishes, or at
least stabilizes. In a way, the Met has been a victim of its
success, its social prestige bringing in ample contributions
without reliance on a large endowment. As it approached its
centenary season in 1983, its endowment was a negligible several
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But with Mrs. Harrington's gift, the first endowment fund was
created nearly 20 years ago. With withdrawals in the 6 to 7 percent
range _ well below the annual growth rate for the investment _ the
fund has grown to $171 million, Kinnear said. That now provides the
Met about $8 million a year in income, covering less than 7 percent
of its annual costs.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the $200 million raised through the endowment
campaign, with growth, and a $400 million fund should result,
Kinnear said.
</P>
<P>
   At a more conservative rate of withdrawal, about 5 percent, that
would provide the Met about $20 million a year, or 10 percent of an
expanded budget of $200 million a year, Volpe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' he added, ``would relieve some of the annual pressure
on fund-raising.''

HYDE DEFENDS PANEL AS IT SEEKS MOVE STARR MATERIAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Responding to Democratic accusations of
partisanship, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., said his panel will seek more material from the independent
counsel, but will vote as early as Monday on whether to move
forward with impeachment proceedings against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde called charges that he has shown disdain for Democrats
unfounded, saying he has tried to be ``as fair as humanly
possible,'' in his role as leader of the powerful committee.
However, Jim Jordan, a Democratic spokesman for the panel,
disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said he would honor a Democratic request that the panel
seek further materials from independent counsel Kenneth Starr _ any
documents Starr did not send to Congress _ relating to Clinton's
efforts to cover up an extramarital affair with former White House
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats believe the documents might confirm their ``lurking
suspicion,'' Hyde said, that Starr did not give Congress
exculpatory evidence favorable to the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats would like to make Starr the issue,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan said the chairman's acceptance of the Democrats'
request was a ``new development,'' adding that the Republicans
voted down a similar motion from the Democrats last week.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, speaking Monday at a news conference he convened, also
derided Democratic allegations that he is seeking sole authority to
subpoena witnesses if the House proceeds with impeachment hearings
against Clinton. The chairman said he wants no more authority to
subpoena witnesses than the committee's top Democrat, Rep. John
Conyers Jr. of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that is in fact the case, that is a very hopeful sign for
the future of this investigation,'' Jordan said. He said Hyde's
efforts to appease committee Democrats follow polls showing public
perception of partisanship in the Judiciary Committee's impeachment
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we'll see this week will be a kind of tactical
recalibration among committee Republicans,'' Jordan said. ``They'll
spend much of the next week trying to get on the right side of many
of these process issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, despite stating his goal is bipartisanship, said
Republicans _ as the majority party on the committee and in the
House _ enjoy certain privileges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have striven mightily to be fair,'' Hyde said of himself
and his GOP colleagues. ``But we cannot let them (Democrats) run
the committee, as much as they would like to.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's spirited defense followed cries of partisanship from
committee Democrats after the panel voted Friday along party lines
to release much of more than 50,000 pages of documents Starr sent
to Congress on Sept. 9. The documents comprise information Starr
gathered in support of his allegation that Clinton committed 11
impeachable offenses in attempting to cover up his relationship
with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Following the vote, Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said, ``We're
afraid this (proposed impeachment inquiry) will get to the floor
with no procedure, no structure, no boundaries.'' Rep. Zoe Lofgren,
D-Calif., said the Republicans ``do not meet requirements of the
Constitution, nor do they meet the standards of fairness set 24
years ago'' during the impeachment hearings on President Richard
Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Segments of the documents to be made public this week will be
redacted to preserve the confidentiality of ongoing criminal
investigations, protect the reputations of innocent people and keep
from public display sexually explicit details that are irrelevant
or redundant, Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde also said the Judiciary Committee's panel on the
Constitution plans to hold hearings soon in an effort to define
what constitutes an impeachable offense. The subcommittee will seek
comments from constitutional scholars and other academics who have
examined the issue of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   However, Judiciary Committee members would not be bound by any
definition of impeachable offense the professors might provide,
Hyde said. ``Every member of the committee will make their own mind
up,'' he said.

   In the Gulf of Mexico, many of the petroleum industry's floating
oil rigs are kept in place over their wells with the aid of GPS
signals. John E. Chance &AMP; Associates Inc., a division of Fegro of
the Netherlands, moves rigs into place using GPS signals, and sets
up on-board computers that keep watch over a rig's precise position
and automatically fire underwater thrusters to move it back into
position if it drifts away.
</P>
<P>
   The labor required to position a rig has been cut in half, said
Jim O'Neal, general manager of Chance's marine group.
</P>
<P>
   Rising civilian and commercial demand for GPS has prompted the
government's interagency board to approve tripling the number of
civilian radio signals coming from the military satellites. The
decision was announced earlier this year, but carrying it out has
been at least temporarily delayed by technical questions, costs and
competition for space on the radio-frequency spectrum. Canny said
the additional signals were expected to be available on new
satellites by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   One of the largest users of the new signals will be airlines,
employing the Federal Aviation Administration's new Wide Area
Augmentation System. The system is supposed to allow pilots and air
traffic controllers to determine an aircraft's location to an
accuracy of within 25 feet _ enabling planes to save fuel and time
by flying directly between airports rather than along strictly
controlled corridors as they must do now to avoid risk of
collisions. Using existing GPS signals and ground-reference points,
the first phase will be introduced next year.
</P>
<P>
   Even Hollywood has embraced GPS.
</P>
<P>
   In Sylvester Stallone's movie ``Daylight,'' with its climatic
escape from a flooded Holland Tunnel into the Hudson River, the
main characters were shown bursting through the river's surface
from the dark depths below.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Ron Goodman, president of Spacecam, a
special-effects film company in Los Angeles, the river was shot
during the winter without the actors present. A helicopter camera
panned down from the New York skyline as two GPS units, one near
the camera and one on the helicopter's tail, recorded the exact
spatial orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The camera angle and orientation were later duplicated over Lake
Casitas near Los Angeles to film two stunt doubles emerging from
the water. Only later did the actors bubble up in a nice warm
studio tank _ leaving the rest to the special-effects magicians.

TEXAS SENATOR SEEKS TO REVAMP JOB-TRAINING PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID HENDRICKS  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas _ Funds in the state's main job-training
program are being spent in the cities with the lowest unemployment,
not where they are needed most, a state senator who vowed to
overhaul the system said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carlos Truan, a Democrat from Corpus Christi, said he would
sponsor legislation next year to change the state code for the
Smart Jobs program to distribute the funds on the basis of city
unemployment rates and the total number of unemployed people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have double-digit unemployment in the border counties,''
Truan told the Future of the Region conference in Corpus Christi.
</P>
<P>
   ``The region received only 12 percent of the (Smart Jobs) grants
between 1994 and 1997,'' Truan said. ``In contrast, Dallas-Fort
Worth, with an unemployment rate of only 3.2 percent, received 44
percent of Smart Jobs funds.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Texas Workforce Commission statistics for August,
the unemployment rates in border areas were: 17.5 percent in
McAllen; 12.4 percent in the Brownsville-Harlingen area; 10.5
percent in El Paso; and 9.1 percent in Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   Smart Jobs was created five years ago by then-Texas Gov. Ann
Richards. It uses surplus unemployment-tax revenues, during times
of overall low state jobless rates, to fund job-site training
programs for companies moving to or opening in Texas and to retrain
existing workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can that help us, though, when we get such a small piece
of the action?'' Truan asked.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has came up during hearings around the state held by
Truan, who heads a Senate committee on the North American Free
Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas-Fort Worth area won the upper hand in the Smart Jobs
arena by getting its grant requests in early on a first-come,
first-serve basis, with no consideration given to the area's low
unemployment rate, Truan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no excuse for the Dallas-Fort Worth area to get so
much of the Smart Jobs funds when it has one-fourth of the
unemployment rate,'' the senator said.
</P>
<P>
   The Future of the Region conference is being held to help set a
legislative agenda, especially for the 1999 legislative session.

OBSCURE EELS SLIP BACK INTO THE PICTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the surface, there's no reason at all for you or most anybody
else to care about the Electric Eels.
</P>
<P>
   Formed in 1970, the Cleveland group spent the vast majority of
its time rehearsing in a loft, drinking, fighting with each other,
and making a somewhat crude racket that suggested Captain Beefheart
jamming with the Stooges _ with a little free jazz on the side.
</P>
<P>
   They sang about being agitated, God being in a refrigerator,
staying up all night waiting for imaginary phone calls, their love
of bunnies, and so on. They played six gigs _ approximately; nobody
was keeping track back then _ mainly in tiny bars. They never
released anything during their time together, and the plug was
pulled on them during their last show in September 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, so? Well, here's the deal: The Eels were great _ great in
a messy, half-formed, over-amped way, but great nonetheless: They
were punk _ or New Wave or whatever _ years before the Ramones and
the Damned and the Sex Pistols released anything.
</P>
<P>
   And now they're back. In a year of important reissues,
compilations and live CDs, the new ``Their Organic Majesty's
Request'' stands out like a proudly sore thumb: A career summary of
a band that never had a career, that was largely ignored even in
its own town and that, despite all that, stands up musically and as
a cultural artifact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's phenomenal _ it's very comprehensive and pulls
everything back together again,'' said Brian McMahon, who played
guitar with the band and wrote what were probably its best two
songs, ``Agitated'' and ``Accident.'' ``We were totally
unappreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   Life as an Eel, McMahon said, meant working a day job (he
alternated between being a fry cook and doing carpentry) and
showing up at the loft to play and throw ideas at each other. They
were all frustrated by the state of rock 'n' roll, by the lack of
venues to play _ and it came out in the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was, we didn't talk about it and didn't plan it _ or
even criticize each other's work or make changes,'' he said. ``We
accepted _ all or nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The influences, McMahon said, ranged from '60s pop to the first
two Alice Cooper LPs to the New York Dolls to jazz guys like Albert
Ayler. Everybody was trying to be the leader at once, nobody had
any money, and finally, in 1975, the band broke up after McMahon
and guitarist John Morton had a fistfight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was eating my Swiss cheese, and I couldn't stand for
that,'' McMahon said. ``It was always petty stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The members grew apart; Morton became a visual artist living in
Brooklyn, drummer Nick Knox joined the Cramps, vocalist Dave
McManus joined a mission, and Paul Marotta (who subbed for McMahon)
still leads the Styrenes, another Cleveland band from that era.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Eels' legend grew via several small-label
compilations, including last year's ``Those Were Different Times,''
which includes tracks from the Eels, the Styrenes and the Mirrors.
Back in 1990, McMahon heard one of them, ``Having a Philosophical
Investigation With the Electric Eels,'' and decided to try to make
music again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all came back in a flood,'' he said. ``I really missed it.
It revitalized me, and I thought I should pick up the torch and run
with it again. I realized this is what I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then he has released a CD, ``17 Volts,'' and, this year,
an LP, ``An Inch Equals a Thousand Miles.'' He tours, he gets to
play his music and he's happy _ even though, he said, the chances
of a full-on Eels reunion are slim to none.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way Davey would do it,'' he said. ``But I feel once
an Eel, always an Eel _ and that's that. I still hold out hope for
us.''
</P>

FIRM SAYS MICROSOFT BROWSER NOW MOST USED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp.'s Internet browser is now the nation's most
popular, according to a new study released Monday by International
Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results ... show a dramatic shift toward Microsoft
Internet Explorer,'' said IDC researcher Joan-Carol Brigham, who
questioned nearly 1,100 computer users about their Internet
browsing habits during the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Brigham found that the market share of the Netscape Communicator
browser fell by nine percentage points over the period. Among
stand-alone browsers, Netscape still leads with 41.5 percent of the
market, down from 50.5 percent at the end of last year. But
Microsoft's stand-alone version of Internet Explorer gained ground,
going from 22.8 percent to 27.5 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 13 million subscribers to the America Online
computer network get a built-in Microsoft browser as part of the
AOL software package. The IDC study found that AOL's browser market
share stood at 16.3 percent, barely up from last year. When this
number is added to the users of Microsoft's stand-alone browser, it
gives Microsoft the overall lead in Internet browser use, with 43.8
percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   The report contained more worrisome news for Netscape _ it's
losing market share among small-and medium-sized business users.
But most of the gain isn't going to the stand-alone Microsoft
browser. Instead, many business people are using AOL for Internet
access. Brigham said that AOL's well-organized forums for business
and financial information appeal to business people who don't want
to spend hours searching the entire Internet for information. But
their choice of AOL also amounts to another vote for the Microsoft
browser.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, Netscape has dominated the browser market. Microsoft
gained a foothold by giving away its Internet Explorer at no
charge. Late last year, Netscape did the same with Communicator,
but the tactic has apparently done nothing to stop the erosion in
Netscape's market share.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think quite frankly that it's because IE has been recognized
by customers as the better product,'' said Microsoft browser
product manager Mike Nichols. But Brigham blamed Netscape's failure
to market its browser as effectively as Microsoft. ``I just think
Microsoft yells louder than Netscape,'' Brigham said. ``Bit for
bit, they're not that much different.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Rothschild, vice president of client products for Netscape,
said that sheer browser numbers are less important now, because
Netscape is using its browser mainly as a way to attract traffic to
its Netcenter Web ``portal''site, which is supported by advertising
revenues. The more visitors, the more money for Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Rothschild said that the Microsoft browsers built into AOL
software do not direct customers to Microsoft's competing Web
portal, MSN. In addition, the AOL version of Microsoft's browser
lacks many features of the stand-alone version. Therefore,
Rothschild still considers Netscape's browser as the market leader.

LOW FUNDS COSTS ATTRACT INVESTORS, TRADE GROUP SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rebutting assertions that the mutual fund industry does too
little to disclose investor costs, the industry's top trade group
official said Monday that fund purveyors do a good job of letting
Americans know just how much they pay for their investments.
</P>
<P>
   Previewing remarks he will make today before the US &UR;  &LR; House of
Representatives in Washington, D.C., Matthew P. Fink, president of
the Investment Company Institute, told reporters that the $5.1
trillion fund industry had lowered sales commissions and kept
annual expenses flat over the past decade. The lower costs boost
total returns, a process which attracts investors and spurs
competitors to lower their charges, Fink said in a conference call
with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's pressure on people to keep down fees, because
(otherwise) it would hurt performance,'' Fink said. ``So, total
costs are declining.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But information about costs is less common in the retirement
plan industry, which has 42 percent of its assets in mutual funds,
he said. Asset management companies overseeing employer- sponsored
defined-contribution plans, such as 401(k)s, should be compelled to
provide participants with fee and cost information, he said.
Currently, such information is provided only upon request. By
contrast, individual investors automatically receive cost
information when they order fund prospectuses or buy funds from
banks or brokers.

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The issue of what fund investors pay and how much they know
about the process is gaining heat. Earlier this year, the SEC
approved measures to make prospectuses easier to read. In May,
Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Arthur Levitt Jr.
chastised fund companies for talking too much about performance and
not enough about what they actually charge.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly fewer funds charge ``front-load'' fees, which are
one-time fees levied when an investor buys a fund. Among funds that
do carry front loads, the amount has been halved to around 5
percent since the mid-1980s. Annual operating expenses, which cover
a fund's administrative costs, are flat at an average 1.5 percent,
according to the ICI.
</P>
<P>
   The flat-to-lower costs are benefiting investors, Fink said,
adding that around 72 percent of fund shareholder accounts are in
stock funds with expense ratios below the 1.5 percent average. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Some observers have wondered why explosive growth in the fund
industry, which has quintupled in size this decade, has not
resulted in a greater industrywide reduction in fees. But a recent
study by Lipper Analytical Services Inc. found that investors
should look to individual funds, rather than to the industry as a
whole, for economies of scale. Fink &UR;  &LR; said costs depend upon a
variety of factors, including whether a fund's assets grew due to a
rising market or to new investments.

   NEW YORK _ ``I'm one of those crazy music people,'' said Alberto
W. Vilar, by way of explaining how he came to give or pledge close
to $40 million in recent years to the Metropolitan Opera for new
productions, developing artists and its endowment campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It was all his father's doing, Vilar, 57, said in the sleek
offices of his Amerindo Investment Advisers Inc. Growing up in the
1940s and 1950s in Cuba and Puerto Rico, where his father managed
sugar mills, the young Alberto fell in love with classical music
but was forbidden to listen to it by his father. ``He didn't want
his kid to be a longhair,'' Vilar recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He never got over it. Now, after putting in his usual 12-hour
day managing his company's nearly $3 billion in growth stock
portfolios, he takes a shower, steps into his tuxedo and heads for
the Met. ``Music is the perfect complement to my life,'' he said.
He has little time for theater, movies, television or literature.
``I go to two movies a year,'' he said, ``both bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Enormously wealthy and divorced with no family commitments, he
is free to indulge his passion. Displaced by the Cuban revolution,
he came to New York and got a job in Citibank's Latin American
offices at 399 Park Avenue, the same building where he later
located Amerindo's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   He next drifted to Wall Street, where he invested in growth
companies like Rubbermaid and the forerunners of the computer and
genetics revolutions, Microsoft, Netscape, America Online and
Genentech.
</P>
<P>
   An Indonesian business connection prompted him to form the
American-Indonesian Investment Co., but there was never any
investment from Indonesia and he shortened the name to Amerindo.
The privately held company, of which Vilar is president and a
leading partner, manages institutional portfolios specializing in
technology and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond his largess for the Met, he has underwritten a tour of
Valery Gergiev's Kirov Opera to Baden-Baden, Germany, and he is
paying to send the Kirov to Britain next year to perform ``War and
Peace.''
</P>
<P>
   He has other causes, too. An avid skier, he took a bad fall
several years ago and went through five operations at the Hospital
for Special Surgery in New York. This year, he ended up giving $4.1
million to endow a new research center there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got very lucky,'' he said.

2,500 FEWER FACTORY JOBS IN BAY STATE, GROUP SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  BOSTON _ Massachusetts lost 2,500 manufacturing jobs during
the second quarter of this year and can expect further declines in
the current quarter, according to a report prepared by
DRI/McGraw-Hill for Associated Industries of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   DRI said the strength of the US dollar and Asian financial
problems were largely to blame, reversing a surge of exports by Bay
State companies between 1994 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The economic consulting firm's report, released Monday, said the
Massachusetts manufacturing sector remains strong, adding jobs at a
rate faster than the US average. The state had posted a gain of
6,900 jobs between Jan. 1 and March 31.
</P>
<P>
   But DRI chief regional economist Sara Johnson said declines are
continuing. She said 2,000 more factory layoffs occurred during
July and August, after the three-month period covered by the
DRI/AIM report, and continued declines in exports are all but
certain.
</P>
<P>
   Average factory earnings in Massachusetts increased 2.1 percent
during the second quarter, DRI said, but hourly wages, adjusted for
inflation, fell seven-tenths of one percent.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer prices in the Boston area meanwhile rose at a 2.8
percent annual rate, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of all Bay State job losses from January
through August were in computer and computer-related industries,
Johnson said, reflecting fewer exports to Asia and the effects of
Compaq Computer Corp.'s takeover of Digital Equipment Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Other sectors reporting significant losses were apparel, paper,
and fabricated metals. Gains were recorded, however, in instrument
manufacturing, transportation equipment, petroleum and chemicals,
lumber, printing, and publishing.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of Asia's economic problems on Massachusetts show up
sharply in export statistics. Seasonally adjusted exports worldwide
fell about 6.5 percent to $17.3 billion during the quarter, from a
peak of $18.5 billion last summer, DRI said.
</P>
<P>
   But shipments to Asia, which last year accounted for 31 percent
of all Massachusetts exports, were down 18.7 percent, for a total
loss of $700 million in business.
</P>
<P>
   Exports to Canada and Latin America also were down.
</P>
<P>
   Production, a measure of the real value of goods produced in the
state, was virtually unchanged during the second quarter after an
exceptional rise of 9.3 percent last winter.

HASBRO-GALOOB UNION WOULD CREATE `STAR WARS' TOY GIANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hasbro Inc. appears to be placing another big bet on ``Star
Wars'' _ and a smaller one on ``Spice Girls.''
</P>
<P>
   As the volatile toy industry rapidly consolidates and becomes
more influenced by hit movies, TV shows, and pop culture, Hasbro
announced plans to pay $220 million in cash to buy Galoob Toys
Inc., whose toy chest includes ``Spice Girls'' dolls, ``Pound
Puppies,'' and toys inspired by the ``Star Wars'' movie series.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Hasbro warned Wall Street that profits for the
second half of the year may not meet expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed union of the country's second and third largest toy
makers could allow Hasbro to dominate the category of ``Star Wars''
toys.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hasbro, of Pawtucket, R.I., and Galoob, of South San
Francisco, Calif., bet heavily on ``Star Wars'' when they outbid
industry leader Mattel Inc. to win the major licensing rights to
make toys based on a new ``Star Wars'' trilogy of movies.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreements with Lucasfilm Ltd., Hasbro can make large
``Star Wars'' action figures and board games, while Galoob has the
rights to make tiny figures and miniature vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of such toys could boom next spring when the first ``Star
Wars'' prequel movie is set to reach theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Over the life of the licensing agreements, toy rights could be
worth $4 billion in sales, industry analysts have speculated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Galoob is a tremendous addition to a rich brand portfolio''
that includes such action figures as G.I. Joe as well as famous
board games such as Monopoly and Scrabble, said Alan G. Hassenfeld,
chairman and chief executive of Hasbro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hasbro's global reach and resources will enormously expand the
potential of Galoob's brands,'' said Mark D. Goldman, president and
chief executive of Galoob.
</P>
<P>
   Because Galoob is so tiny, the acquisition is not expected to
raise anti-trust concerns, one Wall Street analyst said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Galoob reported sales of $239.6 million, compared with
Hasbro's $3.18 billion in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Hasbro warned investors Monday _ as Mattel did last
week _ that profits might be less than expected because Toys 'R Us,
the giant retailer, has reduced its orders to the toymakers in an
effort to compete more effectively against Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and
other large discount chains.
</P>
<P>
   Galoob has had its own problems, losing money for its last
several quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Some of its recent poor performance may be due to the fact that
there has been no ``Star Wars'' event to drive sales of the ``Star
Wars'' toys, which account for a major portion of Galoob's revenue.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, Hasbro appeared to be offering a premium price
for Galoob. Hasbro's offer worked out to $12 a share; on Friday,
Galoob shares had a closing price of $8.
</P>
<P>
   But Tucker Anthony analyst Margaret Whitfield cautioned that the
price of toy industry acquisitions can often seem high.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on how much cost savings there are,'' said
Whitfield, who noted that the acquisition of Tyco Toys Inc. last
year by Mattel ``yielded significant savings'' for Mattel.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Star Wars'' toy license alone may be valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, after Hasbro and Galoob won the toy rights for the
next series of ``Star Wars'' movies, one toy industry analyst told
``Business Week'' that, given the value of its ``Star Wars''
license, Galoob might be worth $25 a share in a takeover scenario.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Galoob shares were trading at about $11.
</P>
<P>
   Arcadia Investment Corp. analyst John G. Taylor said Hasbro has
the potential for significant savings as it adds Galoob's ``Star
Wars'' toy lines to its own.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro's international distribution system is more efficient
than Galoob's, and there's an opportunity for big savings in
marketing and advertising, Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   A Galoob acquisition may have an added benefit for Hasbro.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel has long ruled the toy category of miniature cars with
its Hot Wheels and Matchbox lines, but Hasbro has been making some
recent inroads, thanks to a Nascar licensing agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Adding Galoob's Micro Machines entry to Hasbro's lines of
miniature vehicles can only strengthen Hasbro, Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro's announcement came as the toy industry is going through
many changes. Big discount chains such as Wal-Mart and Target have
been taking market share away from Toys `R Us, both Mattel's and
Hasbro's largest customer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on-line toy retailers have also been chipping away at
the lofty pre-eminence that Toys `R Us once enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   Industry changes led to Hasbro's announcement last year that it
would cut its worldwide work force of 12,000 employees by 20
percent as a way to save $350 million over five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``1998 has been and will continue to be a tough year for the toy
industry,'' analyst Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Following Monday's announcement that Hasbro's profits won't
match expectations, analyst Whitfield said she plans to lower her
earnings estimates for Hasbro for both 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But if Whitfield thinks the problems of 1998 could spill over
into 1999, Taylor said the scheduled release of a new ``Star Wars''
movie has made him more optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``1999 could do a 180,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro's acquisition of Galoob is expected to be completed
during the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Hasbro acquired Tiger Electronics Inc, the maker of
Giga Pets and Laser Tag, for $335 million. Earlier this month,
Hasbro completed a $70 million acquisition of MicroProse Inc.,
which makes 3-D computer games.
</P>
<P>
   On the American Stock Exchange, shares of Hasbro fell 1 to close
at 30. On the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Galoob rose 3 7/16
to 11 7/16.

THE GRAVITY OF PRINT, THE `POP' OF TV 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects spelling of Steven Brill in 2d paragraphg; a and e
coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN and MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The day after Bill Clinton's grand jury testimony was beamed
into our homes, front-page newspaper stories assessed his
performance. The Washington Post said he'd ``vigorously defended
himself'' while The New York Times declared him ``irate and sad.''
In the Globe, he was ``animated.''
</P>
<P>
   But those post-mortems were largely a moot point for the 23
million Americans who had watched the televised testimony. ``Once
you show people 5 to 10 minutes of the real stuff, unedited,'' said
Steven Brill, founder of Court TV and an expert on the court of
public opinion, ``they think they know a lot.'' And they don't need
a headline to tell them which way the wind's blowing.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton testimony marked another pivotal day in a scandal
that has redrawn the relationship between old and new media and
most significantly, between the gravity of the printed page and the
visceral pop of the television screen. In short, despite a
temporary jump in newspaper sales, the primacy of television became
even harder to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Like most major stories, the saga of the president and the
intern had its beginnings in print. Like all major stories in the
late 20th century, it will likely have its ending, or at least its
defining moments, on television.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis de Tocqueville, whom Bill Clinton is fond of quoting,
wrote in 1835 that ``scarcely any political question arises in the
United States that is not resolved, sooner or later, into a
judicial question.'' In 1998, scarcely any political question
arises in the United States that is not resolved, sooner or later,
into a TV spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows this better than Clinton, who played the saxophone
on ``The Arsenio Hall Show'' as a candidate in 1992, the same year
he slam-dunked George Bush during a ``town hall'' debate whose
format favored the TV-friendly Clinton. One endlessly replayed
television picture _ of Clinton hugging Monica Lewinsky at a
meet-the-public event _ has been worth many thousands of words
throughout this scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Many damning words have been written about Clinton in the
nation's leading newspapers. (To date, about 170 papers have called
for him to leave office.) But it may be that the print media never
stood a chance against a president who is the most sophisticated TV
personality of the age, a Johnny Carson-like maestro of the medium.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's better to be lucky than good, and Clinton, the
talk-show president, may be the lucky beneficiary of the
Oprahfication of America.
</P>
<P>
   Infidelity? Office hanky-panky? Phone sex? Cigars, even? Old-hat
yawners to the millions who tune in daily to ``The Jerry Springer
Show'' or ``Sally Jessy Raphael'' or ``Montel Williams.'' On a
typical day, the soap operas that were preempted Monday by the
networks are racier than the Clinton testimony ballyhooed as
``salacious'' by political pundits.
</P>
<P>
   US Rep. Edward J. Markey, the ranking Democrat on the House
Telecommunications subcommittee, says he believes the nation
brought the assumptions of television to the experience of watching
their president testify about sex in a legal setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got `Law and Order,' `L.A. Law,' `The Practice,' `Ally
McBeal,'' said Markey. ``It was the cumulative course-load of
having gone to TV law school, combined with their ability to
evaluate the guests on morning talk shows, which they all applied
to determining whether the president should pay with his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``They walked away with the common-sense decision that they
did not find an impeachable offense,'' concluded Markey.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the cultural context in which Clinton operates is his own
remarkable fluency in the idiom of television. That skill was
evident again during his grand jury testimony, as he made clear
that he suspected ``this unprecedented videotape'' would be
eventually leaked and televised.
</P>
<P>
   His resort to tortured, legalistic evasion has been much mocked
by pundits, who seemed to barely notice the way Clinton maintained
sympathetic eye contact with the camera, and the way he adroitly
crafted sound bites for the larger TV audience as he was being
grilled: ``There's some kind of gotcha game in this deposition.''
``I'm not going to answer your trick questions.'' ``You
(prosecutors) have made this the most important issue in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton has seen enough courtroom melodramas on TV to know
how the beleaguered good guy is supposed to sound on the witness
stand. Television's tried-and-true entertainment values surrounded
this production; during one break in the action, CNN's Greta van
Sustern, sounding for all the world like Dan Dierdorf diagraming a
play on ``Monday Night Football,'' told viewers: ``Here we see
prosecutors trying to set a trap.''
</P>
<P>
   If ``Monica-gate'' has boiled down to made-for-TV sport, that's
one clear way in which it differs from Watergate. That scandal,
driven by two obscure Washington Post reporters, was an
old-fashioned print press story.
</P>
<P>
   Yet from the outset, the ink-stained wretches had a slippery
grip on the first presidential scandal of the modern media era.
Newsweek's Michael Isikoff may have done the hard work needed to
break the Lewinsky scoop back in January. But when Newsweek briefly
held the story, it was hijacked onto the Internet by Matt Drudge
and filtered into the Beltway buzz machine by a Sunday morning TV
talk show.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers believe that chain of events symbolized print's
inability to keep pace with a saga nurtured by a feverish media
culture dominated by 24-hour cable news channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an Internet and cable TV story,'' said Steven
Stark, author of ``Glued to the Set,'' a history of influential
television shows. ``Cable television has kept the story alive for
months and has been hooked on it. ... What you're looking for is a
soap opera.''
</P>
<P>
   In one telling poll taken by the Media Studies Center early this
year, 68 percent of the respondents said they were getting most of
their Lewinsky-related information from television while only 13
percent cited newspapers. A year earlier, when people were asked
were about the source of most of their news, the split was 50
percent television and 24 percent newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in some ways, this distasteful matter has lifted all boats
in the media pool. The Sept. 11 release of Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr's report proved a major boon for a newspaper industry
that was actually better equipped to handle the steamy sexual
material in somber-looking reprints than were the harried
television reporters trying to decide which dirty words were fit
for afternoon TV.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a Pew Research Center survey revealed that of the 48
percent of the public that had read or heard at least part of the
Starr report, 28 percent got that information from newspapers and
only 15 percent were tuned into the television set. The
Philadelphia Inquirer edition that contained the report saw a
stunning increase of 140,000 single-copy sales; the Los Angeles
Times sold an extra 64,000 papers; and Chicago Tribune sales of
that paper were up by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were chary about putting (the Starr report) on the
air,'' noted presidential historian Henry Graff. The Starr report
``enabled the mainline instruments of communication to be
pornographic. ... We've revived the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   That phenomenon notwithstanding, newspapers aren't built to
compete with the instant gratification medium of television. And
many observers think that in a story of this nature, it's a mistake
to try. Print's role is not to replicate television's instantaneous
power, but to bring some depth and context to the dizzying whir of
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an enormous opportunity for print to be the clarifying
medium, if they'll do it,'' said Jon Katz, media critic for Rolling
Stone magazine. ``I think that people who care about the civic life
of the country would flock to a medium they trust. ... They're a
perfect antidote to all this insanity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say the newspapers have delivered the most even-handed
balanced coverage, but in this accelerating culture, print is
always behind the Internet and television,'' added Stark. ``Eighty
percent of the public wants context and balance. But the problem is
that everyone is competing for that other 20 percent.''

NEW GERMAN LEADER FACES THE REALITY OF GOVERNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BONN _ In the wake of his decisive victory over longtime
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Gerhard Schroeder, Germany's new leader, on
Monday began defining how he intends to govern Western Europe's
most powerful country.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, who won Sunday's election with vague promises to fix
the country's ailing economy by creating more jobs, announced that
he intends to form a coalition between his center-left Social
Democratic Party and the small, environmentalist Green Party, which
has never before been in government.
</P>
<P>
   The incoming chancellor faces a difficult task. Germany's
economy, once the envy of Europe, has stagnated in recent years,
pushing unemployment to nearly 11 percent of the work force, or 4
million people.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists say the country's problems will continue unless
the government cuts back many of Germany's generous social
benefits, lowers taxes and gives employers more flexibility in
hiring and firing workers.
</P>
<P>
   In his campaign, Schroeder promised to reform the government but
remained quiet on how he would accomplish the changes. In their
campaign platform, the Social Democrats said only that they would
``improve the country's efficiency'' and ``cut bureaucracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's first move came Monday night when he asked the
Greens to join his party in a governing coalition. Although the
Social Democrats won the most votes in the election, they will
control only about 45 percent of the seats in parliament. If the
Greens join them, the coalition would have a 21-seat majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Greens are our natural partner in government,'' Schroeder
said after announcing that the two parties would begin talks on
Friday to form a new government.
</P>
<P>
   But before the negotiations even began, critics charged that the
coalition would fail to push through major reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how it can work,'' said Guenter Rexrodt, the
outgoing finance minister. ``Both of these parties are for big
government and high taxes, and now they say they will be completely
different.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, last spring the Greens called for a new tax that would
nearly triple the price of a liter of gasoline to around $3. They
also advocated a 60 mph speed limit on the autobahn.
</P>
<P>
   But Schroeder's party made clear during the campaign that such
proposals were preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the parties agreed in principle, on issues such as
ending Germany's use of nuclear power, which supplies 30 percent of
the country's energy, the Social Democrats took a pragmatic
approach. They said they want to shut down nuclear plants ``as soon
as possible'' while the Greens wanted to close them immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country talks of reforms, and the Greens speak of things
that will cost more and increase the government'' Rexrodt charged.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his differences with the Greens, Schroeder also faces
problems within his own party.
</P>
<P>
   Many of its left-wing members have never accepted his calls for
change in social programs, remaining committed to Germany's
generous welfare system. Schroeder was able to keep this faction of
his party in check during the campaign, but with the election over,
some analysts predicted it will re-emerge.
</P>
<P>
   ``That part of the party will want some kind of reward for
keeping quiet during the campaign,'' said Max Kaase, a political
scientist at the Social Science Research Institute in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition between the Social Democrats and the Greens also
faces potential problems on foreign policy issues. During the
campaign, Schroeder promised to continue many of Kohl's policies,
including expanding NATO and moving toward a single European
currency. But the Green Party has voiced some opposition to both of
these initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Another test of the new government could be possible German
participation in proposed NATO strikes to quell bloodshed in the
Serb-led Yugoslav province of Kosovo, where the majority ethnic
Albanians are fighting for independence. Schroeder skirted the
issue of Germany's role Monday by saying Kohl technically is still
in power.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say Schroeder's task in overcoming these problems
may be even more difficult because his victory resulted mainly from
Kohl's unpopularity, not from his own ideas and policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a vote for Schroeder but against Kohl, and this will
make it hard for Schroeder to push through any changes,'' Kaase
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks before the election, it had become clear that the
German people were tired of Kohl, who has led the country for 16
years. Despite his successes in uniting western and eastern Germany
in 1990 after the collapse of communism and in winning the nation's
approval for the new European currency, the euro, polls showed
Kohl's approval ratings at around 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As the election neared, the question was whether Kohl's
unpopularity would drag down his party, the conservative Christian
Democratic Union, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The answer came early Sunday evening as exit polls showed the
CDU with staggering loses around the country. By the end of the
night, the CDU and its partner, the Christian Socialist Union,
received only 35 percent of the vote _ a drop of more than 6
percentage points from 1994 and the party's worst showing since
1949.
</P>
<P>
   As the results rolled in, many CDU supporters began to say in
public what they had quietly thought since the election campaign
began _ that Kohl had destroyed their party's chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew when he announced he was running again that we would
lose,'' Andreas Maass, a wine distributor and a longtime CDU
supporter, said Sunday night as he watched the election returns
come in at a rally in Bonn. ``Sixteen years is probably too long,
and he was asking the country to keep him around for another four.
It's too much.''
</P>
<P>
   In eastern Germany, the voters, who strongly supported Kohl in
the 1990 and 1994 elections, also turned away from the chancellor,
whom they blamed for the nearly 18 percent unemployment rate in the
former communist state.

MAN IN THE NEWS: GERHARD SCHROEDER, GERMANY'S NEW CHANCELLOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also GERMANY-ELECT, GERMANY-ASSESS.) 
(th) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BONN, Germany _ Gerhard Schroeder, who will soon become
Germany's first new chancellor in 16 years, is a practical man with
a gift for the modern news media; his biggest challenge will be to
define just who he really is.
</P>
<P>
   Having begun his political career as a Marxist student leader in
the late 1960s, he evolved long ago into an immaculately tailored
politician who uses television to project success as much as social
justice.
</P>
<P>
   Now 54, Schroeder prides himself on having ``modernized'' the
left-of-center Social Democratic Party. He relishes the company of
corporate executives. He thrives on television, whether in
speeches, on talk shows or in slick commercials. Far from wincing
when opponents attack him as shallow, Schroeder publicly trumpets
his tactics as if they themselves were an example of his modernity.
</P>
<P>
   But having trounced Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Sunday's
elections, Schroeder must now face the reality within his own
party. And unlike Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, with whom
he is often compared, Schroeder does not control his party and has
not reshaped it to suit his own agenda.
</P>
<P>
   That power still resides in large part with Oskar Lafontaine,
the party's garrulous chairman. Lafontaine, who is 55 and stands
politically to the left of Schroeder, is far more revered by
rank-and-file Social Democrats. He remains more consistent in his
emphasis on social justice and his defense of Germany's social
welfare system, and he is generally credited with rescuing the
party from chronic depression after its long stream of demoralizing
defeats.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder is uncomfortable with his more ideological party
colleagues and his partners in the environmentalist Green Party. He
has ridiculed Green proposals for a huge tax on gasoline, for
example. His intended economics minister is a millionaire
entrepreneur who has infuriated union leaders with free-market
rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people compare Schroeder with Tony Blair or Bill
Clinton, and it is true that his campaign has been very similar,''
said Juergen Falter, a political scientist at Gutenberg University
in Mainz. ``But there is a very big difference: Clinton and Blair
control their parties and Schroeder does not.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schroeder does have a relentless ambition, a strong feel for
the levers of power and a knack for making deals. He was born in
Mossenburg, a small town in Lower Saxony, on April 7, 1944, and
grew up poor. He never knew his father, who died fighting for
Germany in Romania. Schroeder worked as a hardware salesman before
finishing secondary school at 22, and put himself through law
school at Goettingen University with support from the government.
He got his law degree in 1976, when he was 32.
</P>
<P>
   Even as a student leader, Schroeder displayed raw political
talent. In a public debate in the early 1970s with none other than
Kohl, then a legislator, Schroeder proved himself cool and
articulate, and managed periodically to fluster his future
opponent. In 1980, at 36, Schroeder won a seat in parliament and
quickly began to reach for higher things.
</P>
<P>
   After one failed attempt, Schroeder was elected in 1990 as the
premier of Lower Saxony, a state dominated by old-line
manufacturing that was and still is reeling from global competition
and high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   People in Lower Saxony say Schroeder became far more sympathetic
to business interests after becoming premier. He repeatedly told
business leaders that his own success depended on theirs, and he
labored mightily to bail out companies in order to prevent the
shut-down of big factories. His government took over several
troubled companies, including a steel mill earlier this year, a
move that cost the government nearly $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   These are exactly the kinds of actions that ordinarily dismay
free-market advocates, but Schroeder invariably found ways to
quickly re-privatize the companies and sometimes even to make a
profit on the re-sale.
</P>
<P>
   Some people say he also developed a strong dislike for the
environmentalist Green Party, which was part of his state coalition
from 1990 to 1994 and will soon be his partner again in a national
government.
</P>
<P>
   During those four years, Lower Saxony's government spending
skyrocketed, in part to pay for programs supported by the Greens.
When Schroeder's Social Democrats won an outright majority in the
state in 1994, he abandoned the Greens with relish.
</P>
<P>
   ``He absolutely cannot stand the Greens,'' said one business
executive in Hanover. ``He doesn't like their lifestyle, he doesn't
like Birkenstock sandals and he would like nothing more than to be
free of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Tacke, one of Schroeder's top economic officials in Lower
Saxony, denied such animosities, but only partly. ``We can deal
with the Greens coming and we can deal with the Greens going,'' he
said with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Schroeder reiterated his determination to form a national
coalition with the Greens, a tie he needs to gain majority control
of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But he has studiously distanced himself from the Greens,
denouncing them for their opposition to NATO expansion, their
advocacy of huge gasoline taxes and their support for a 60-mph
speed limit on the famously unlimited German autobahn.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Those are the easy issues. The harder ones have to do with
taming Germany's unemployment, which is 10.7 percent nationally and
nearly twice that high in much of the formerly Communist east.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder made unemployment his overarching issue, campaigning
on a quintessentially Social Democratic approach of comprehensive
negotiations between the government, industry and labor.
</P>
<P>
   But the fissures are already apparent. Schroeder's candidate for
economics minister, Jost Stollmann, for example, infuriated labor
leaders by saying the government simply could not force companies
to set binding targets for hiring.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lafontaine has steered the party platform in the
other direction. It was he who promised to reverse three of Kohl's
reforms that reduced mandatory sick pay, made it easier for very
small companies to lay off workers and set in motion a reduction in
future pension benefits.
</P>
<P>
   German business leaders responded by saying that they had little
interest in discussions if the government planned to strike down
those reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder has betrayed no hint of anxiety about these divisions.
When Stollmann came under fire, the future chancellor brushed away
the criticisms and reiterated again Monday that Stollmann would be
his economics minister.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he has campaigned as closely with Lafontaine
as Al Gore and Bill Clinton campaigned against President Bush. The
two men routinely gave back-to-back speeches on the same stage,
with Schroeder referring to Lafontaine as ``dear Oskar'' and
praising him for his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his unexpectedly strong victory, many political analysts
believe Schroeder has yet to earn widespread public trust.
Conservative Germans are still appalled that he has divorced three
times. (He married his fourth wife, a former journalist named Doris
Koepf, a year ago.)
</P>
<P>
   A biting poster circulated by the youth arm of the Christian
Democratic Union showed three attractive women giving the ``thumbs
down'' sign and read, ``Three women can't be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   On the left, traditional Social Democrats would have much
preferred Lafontaine and consider him more committed to core party
principles. Lafontaine competed against Schroeder to be the
candidate for chancellor, but eventually conceded that Schroeder
had the better chance of winning the election.

THE GRAVITY OF PRINT, THE `POP' OF TV 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects spelling of Steven Brill in 2d paragraph; a and e
coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN and MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The day after Bill Clinton's grand jury testimony was beamed
into our homes, front-page newspaper stories assessed his
performance. The Washington Post said he'd ``vigorously defended
himself'' while The New York Times declared him ``irate and sad.''
In the Globe, he was ``animated.''
</P>
<P>
   But those post-mortems were largely a moot point for the 23
million Americans who had watched the televised testimony. ``Once
you show people 5 to 10 minutes of the real stuff, unedited,'' said
Steven Brill, founder of Court TV and an expert on the court of
public opinion, ``they think they know a lot.'' And they don't need
a headline to tell them which way the wind's blowing.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton testimony marked another pivotal day in a scandal
that has redrawn the relationship between old and new media and
most significantly, between the gravity of the printed page and the
visceral pop of the television screen. In short, despite a
temporary jump in newspaper sales, the primacy of television became
even harder to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Like most major stories, the saga of the president and the
intern had its beginnings in print. Like all major stories in the
late 20th century, it will likely have its ending, or at least its
defining moments, on television.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis de Tocqueville, whom Bill Clinton is fond of quoting,
wrote in 1835 that ``scarcely any political question arises in the
United States that is not resolved, sooner or later, into a
judicial question.'' In 1998, scarcely any political question
arises in the United States that is not resolved, sooner or later,
into a TV spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows this better than Clinton, who played the saxophone
on ``The Arsenio Hall Show'' as a candidate in 1992, the same year
he slam-dunked George Bush during a ``town hall'' debate whose
format favored the TV-friendly Clinton. One endlessly replayed
television picture _ of Clinton hugging Monica Lewinsky at a
meet-the-public event _ has been worth many thousands of words
throughout this scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Many damning words have been written about Clinton in the
nation's leading newspapers. (To date, about 170 papers have called
for him to leave office.) But it may be that the print media never
stood a chance against a president who is the most sophisticated TV
personality of the age, a Johnny Carson-like maestro of the medium.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's better to be lucky than good, and Clinton, the
talk-show president, may be the lucky beneficiary of the
Oprahfication of America.
</P>
<P>
   Infidelity? Office hanky-panky? Phone sex? Cigars, even? Old-hat
yawners to the millions who tune in daily to ``The Jerry Springer
Show'' or ``Sally Jessy Raphael'' or ``Montel Williams.'' On a
typical day, the soap operas that were preempted Monday by the
networks are racier than the Clinton testimony ballyhooed as
``salacious'' by political pundits.
</P>
<P>
   US Rep. Edward J. Markey, the ranking Democrat on the House
Telecommunications subcommittee, says he believes the nation
brought the assumptions of television to the experience of watching
their president testify about sex in a legal setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got `Law and Order,' `L.A. Law,' `The Practice,' `Ally
McBeal,'' said Markey. ``It was the cumulative course-load of
having gone to TV law school, combined with their ability to
evaluate the guests on morning talk shows, which they all applied
to determining whether the president should pay with his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``They walked away with the common-sense decision that they
did not find an impeachable offense,'' concluded Markey.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the cultural context in which Clinton operates is his own
remarkable fluency in the idiom of television. That skill was
evident again during his grand jury testimony, as he made clear
that he suspected ``this unprecedented videotape'' would be
eventually leaked and televised.
</P>
<P>
   His resort to tortured, legalistic evasion has been much mocked
by pundits, who seemed to barely notice the way Clinton maintained
sympathetic eye contact with the camera, and the way he adroitly
crafted sound bites for the larger TV audience as he was being
grilled: ``There's some kind of gotcha game in this deposition.''
``I'm not going to answer your trick questions.'' ``You
(prosecutors) have made this the most important issue in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton has seen enough courtroom melodramas on TV to know
how the beleaguered good guy is supposed to sound on the witness
stand. Television's tried-and-true entertainment values surrounded
this production; during one break in the action, CNN's Greta van
Sustern, sounding for all the world like Dan Dierdorf diagraming a
play on ``Monday Night Football,'' told viewers: ``Here we see
prosecutors trying to set a trap.''
</P>
<P>
   If ``Monica-gate'' has boiled down to made-for-TV sport, that's
one clear way in which it differs from Watergate. That scandal,
driven by two obscure Washington Post reporters, was an
old-fashioned print press story.
</P>
<P>
   Yet from the outset, the ink-stained wretches had a slippery
grip on the first presidential scandal of the modern media era.
Newsweek's Michael Isikoff may have done the hard work needed to
break the Lewinsky scoop back in January. But when Newsweek briefly
held the story, it was hijacked onto the Internet by Matt Drudge
and filtered into the Beltway buzz machine by a Sunday morning TV
talk show.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers believe that chain of events symbolized print's
inability to keep pace with a saga nurtured by a feverish media
culture dominated by 24-hour cable news channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an Internet and cable TV story,'' said Steven
Stark, author of ``Glued to the Set,'' a history of influential
television shows. ``Cable television has kept the story alive for
months and has been hooked on it. ... What you're looking for is a
soap opera.''
</P>
<P>
   In one telling poll taken by the Media Studies Center early this
year, 68 percent of the respondents said they were getting most of
their Lewinsky-related information from television while only 13
percent cited newspapers. A year earlier, when people were asked
were about the source of most of their news, the split was 50
percent television and 24 percent newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in some ways, this distasteful matter has lifted all boats
in the media pool. The Sept. 11 release of Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr's report proved a major boon for a newspaper industry
that was actually better equipped to handle the steamy sexual
material in somber-looking reprints than were the harried
television reporters trying to decide which dirty words were fit
for afternoon TV.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a Pew Research Center survey revealed that of the 48
percent of the public that had read or heard at least part of the
Starr report, 28 percent got that information from newspapers and
only 15 percent were tuned into the television set. The
Philadelphia Inquirer edition that contained the report saw a
stunning increase of 140,000 single-copy sales; the Los Angeles
Times sold an extra 64,000 papers; and Chicago Tribune sales of
that paper were up by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were chary about putting (the Starr report) on the
air,'' noted presidential historian Henry Graff. The Starr report
``enabled the mainline instruments of communication to be
pornographic. ... We've revived the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   That phenomenon notwithstanding, newspapers aren't built to
compete with the instant gratification medium of television. And
many observers think that in a story of this nature, it's a mistake
to try. Print's role is not to replicate television's instantaneous
power, but to bring some depth and context to the dizzying whir of
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an enormous opportunity for print to be the clarifying
medium, if they'll do it,'' said Jon Katz, media critic for Rolling
Stone magazine. ``I think that people who care about the civic life
of the country would flock to a medium they trust. ... They're a
perfect antidote to all this insanity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say the newspapers have delivered the most even-handed
balanced coverage, but in this accelerating culture, print is
always behind the Internet and television,'' added Stark. ``Eighty
percent of the public wants context and balance. But the problem is
that everyone is competing for that other 20 percent.''

HYDE MAKES SEVERAL CONCESSIONS TO JUDICIARY COMMITTEE DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla, Mich., Ill., Mass., N.Y.)  (lh) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee acceded to an array of Democratic demands Monday, saying
he wanted to eliminate contentious side issues and keep his
committee focused on whether President Clinton should be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Asserting ``we are doing our level best to be credible,'' Rep.
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said he would dispatch a bipartisan team of
investigators to the office of Kenneth Starr to examine materials
the Whitewater independent counsel has not sent to Congress.
Democrats said last week that they wanted to see whether Starr had
held back any exculpatory information about Clinton's relationship
with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In another bow to the Democrats, Hyde said at a news conference
that he has instructed Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., to convene as
soon as possible a subcommittee hearing to examine precedents on
what qualifies as an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   And seeking to put several other issues to rest, he said the
committee would meet in public session next Monday when it votes on
whether to ask the House to let it open a full impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   And he said that he would support giving the senior Democrat on
the committee, Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the power to issue
subpoenas on his own, if the House authorizes an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde also indicated that he will vote to open a formal
impeachment investigation. ``I should think there is enough to
warrant an inquiry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde made his announcement as Congress faces an uncertain
political environment five weeks before the mid-term elections,
with polls showing that a majority of the public wants to see the
president punished but not impeached for his affair with a White
House intern and his effort to cover it up. The Illinois Republican
emphatically sought to defend the Republican-run committee against
continuing Democratic charges of partisanship, which he said were
designed to divert attention from the president's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to keep focused on our mandate,'' he said. ``The
Democrats would like to make Starr the issue. They would like to
make process, procedure, Peter Rodino, Mark McGwire _ they'd like
to make a lot of things the issue other than what we're looking at.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing our level best to be credible,'' he added. ``If
we aren't credible, what we do amounts to nothing. We understand
that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Press Secretary Mike McCurry said,
``Certainly actions are more important than words. But the
reassurances given by the chairman today were welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee were more
critical, insisting that the full committee, not a subcommittee,
should be deciding what is an impeachable offense, and complaining
they wanted to see Starr's extra materials, not delegate staff to
review them.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are concessions, no question,'' said Rep. Barney Frank,
D-Mass. ``But it's still not bipartisanship.'' Rep. Jerrold Nadler,
D-N.Y., said the Judiciary Committee should first be determining
what is an impeachable offense before voting on whether there
should be a formal impeachment inquiry.

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Yasser Arafat, speaking Monday for the first
time in the annual debate among leaders of governments and major
international organizations, asked a largely sympathetic audience
for help in bringing independence to the Palestinians by May.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, who got a rousing and sustained ovation, wore his usual
military-style jacket and black-and-white headdress as he addressed
the General Assembly, which this year upgraded the status of the
Palestinians' observer mission here.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the Palestinians as ``victims of aggression forced
into a life of diaspora and exile,'' Arafat, looking strong despite
a tremor in his lower jaw and hands, thanked Americans for ``great
efforts to push the peace process forward and protect it.''
</P>
<P>
   He listed what he saw as setbacks to peace for which he holds
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responsible. Netanyahu,
speaking last week, also aired his grievances about the Palestinian
Authority's compliance and the continuing dangers that Israel
faces.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat concluded his speech with a plea: ``I would like to call
upon all of you, from this place, the source of international
legitimacy and peacemaking, the guardian of freedom, security and
stability, and the source for the achievement of justice and
prosperity for humankind to stand by our people, especially as our
people demand of us to shoulder our responsibilities, and they
await the establishment of their independent state.''

GEORGES SPARES NEW ORLEANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Although Hurricane Georges spared New Orleans by
swinging on shore early Monday along the Mississippi Gulf Coast
some 60 miles east of here, the storm succeeded in shutting down
America's greatest party city and drenching the region.
</P>
<P>
   As rain and wind lashed New Orleans throughout the day, the
gloom seemed more compatible with a Sherlock Holmes mystery than
the usual scenes of reverie. Electricity failed in some areas,
telephones were spotty and cable television was inoperative, but
there was no loss of life tied directly to the hurricane and
property damage appeared relatively minor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Georges did what Baptists and prohibitionists have failed
for years to accomplish: it brought Bourbon Street to its knees.
</P>
<P>
   While hundreds of New Orleanians huddled in shelters ranging
from the giant Superdome on the edge of downtown to school
buildings in residential neighborhoods, boozy-floozy Bourbon
Street, the haunt of tourists, lay as lonely as a rural graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   One hole-in-the-wall bar, operating in bootleg fashion around
the corner on St. Peter Street, was operating in defiance of a
police curfew Monday morning. The bartender, who asked not to be
identified, explained that he had opened its doors to accommodate
friends who were washed out of a campground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not really open,'' he said as about a dozen customers
sipped drinks furtively. ``A few other people saw the door open and
walked in.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, streets in the city's French Quarter were deserted
and sidewalks barren of pedestrians. In fact, stretches of
sidewalks were occupied by parked cars, whose owners were trying to
buy a few extra inches in case floodwaters swept the streets as
they did during a tropical storm earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all stores in the city were closed and even hard-core
dives specializing in 'round-the-clock cocktails shuttered their
windows and doors.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists who were unable or unwilling to arrange flights to
escape the city were largely confined to their hotels, but a few
hardy visitors emerged at mid-morning when it appeared that the
worst had passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we got two days of partying in,'' said Mike McNerney
of Pontiac, Mich., who strolled along the Mississippi River levee
with his friend, Ron Stevens. The pair had come to New Orleans last
Friday for a good time and discovered more excitement than they
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I was hoping it would have come a little closer,''
said Stevens. ``I never saw a hurricane before.''
</P>
<P>
   For most New Orleanians, living in a city below sea level, the
brush was close enough. The river has risen perceptibly in the past
two days, though it is still far from flood stage, and one
adventurous European, with little command of English, stripped to
his underwear at mid-day and went swimming from a set of wooden
steps near Jackson Square.
</P>
<P>
   Georges, which had seemed to be pushing irrevocably toward New
Orleans for days, veered away from the city late Sunday and made
landfall about 4 a.m. Monday near Biloxi on the Mississippi Gulf
Coast, about 60 miles from here.
</P>
<P>
   The storm swept beach sand across US 90, a coastal highway where
more than a dozen casinos are located, and created havoc in the
area, but most of the residents in harm's way had fled before the
hurricane struck. In anticipation of the storm, the Mississippi
casinos had been shut for two days.
</P>
<P>
   In southeastern Louisiana, where the greater New Orleans area
was braced for ferocious winds, torrential rain and flooding,
authorities estimated that more than a million residents evacuated
the area. As the storm approached, interstate highways and bridges
across the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain were closed,
sealing hundreds of thousands of others in the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lucky,'' said Tony Marino, a lawyer who lives on
Bourbon Street. A chimney cap blew away during the storm, but his
townhouse suffered no more damage, he said.
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon, as winds diminished and rain dissipated, the
city began to regain life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been coming here for 18 years, a couple of times a year;
we love New Orleans,'' said John London, a television reporter from
Cincinnati who was here with his wife, Joyce Miller. ``She comes
for the literary conferences,'' London said. ``I come for the
daiquiris.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the bars closed, the couple found a port in the storm
Monday at the home of Rosemary James and Joe DeSalvo, who live in
the French Quarter and threw an impromptu lunch for out-of-town
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like about New Orleans,'' said Miller, ``is the spirit
they have here. People tend to relate their experiences to bars.
Even if the bars are closed.''

THREE LEFT-OF-CENTER LEADERS TO MEET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BERLIN _ Within hours of Gerhard Schroeder's dramatic ousting
of the conservative German chancellor Helmut Kohl on Sunday,
British prime minister Tony Blair was on the telephone, inviting
Schroeder and the French leader, Lionel Jospin, to visit him at the
British Labor Party conference in England Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   For Blair, the idea of the left-of-center leaders of the three
European powers standing together is an irresistible photo
opportunity, empirical evidence that his much-hyped ``Third Way''
of politics freed from stifling left-wing ideology has allowed
liberals to topple conservative governments across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   With Schroeder's unseating of Kohl, Europe's most enduring
leader, Spain is now the only major European country with a
right-wing government. In just three years, the conservative
governments in Europe's four largest countries _ Germany, France,
Britain, and Italy _ have been replaced by left-of-center leaders
or coalitions.
</P>
<P>
   Blair claimed Schroeder's election had opened a new era of
European government. Victor Klima, the Austrian chancellor, was
even more effusive, proclaiming that Schroeder's victory was ``a
success for a Europe of employment, a success for a Europe with
more social justice and a success for a Europe of social
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, while liberals across Europe rejoice at their newfound
clout, some more objective voices say this is as much coincidence
as it is a popular endorsement of the centrist positions staked out
by those whose parties were once ideologically rigid.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts and western diplomats say that with the
exception of Britain, where Blair has a commanding parliamentary
majority and faces a weak, divided opposition, conservative parties
could reclaim power in any number of countries over the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
   And while the conventional wisdom is that European integration
will be made easier because so many European governments now share
a broadly similar political outlook, some analysts and diplomats
warn it is not that simple. They say an increasing number of
countries, most notably Germany, Europe's largest, are beginning to
put their own interests before the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, for example, declined to be part of the launch of the
single European currency in January, citing national wariness.
Germany, meanwhile, is wary of Poland joining the European Union,
fearing a flood of cheap labor from their next-door neighbor will
destabilize its already wobbly economy.
</P>
<P>
   Franz-Josef Meiers, a research fellow at the Bonn-based German
Society for Foreign Affairs, cautions against drawing sweeping
conclusions about the three European powers being taken over by
left-of-center leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a problem with people saying there's a master plan
behind it,'' Meiers said. ``I think it's happening by chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than a trend, Meiers sees political realignments that are
peculiar to individual countries, not Europe as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   There is, Meiers points out, a giant difference between the kind
of socialism espoused by Tony Blair and Gerhard Schroeder and the
more traditionally leftist, state interventionist socialism
practiced in France under Jospin.
</P>
<P>
   As Meiers sees it, the only crucial similarity between Blair's
ousting the Conservatives after 18 years of Tory rule in Britain
and Schroeder's victory after 16 years of Kohl's leadership was
voter fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``In both cases, the voters simply got tired of the incumbents.
They wanted a change,'' said Meiers.
</P>
<P>
   While Blair and Schroeder hail the latter's victory as evidence
of the public endorsing what Blair calls the Third Way and what
Schroeder calls the New Center, some analysts and diplomats are
less convinced.
</P>
<P>
   Andreas Staab, a professor of European politics at the London
School of Economics, disputes the idea that Schroeder's victory was
the crowning achievement of left-of-center consensus politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Germans voted conservative with a small c. They didn't want
big sweeping reforms. They wanted the status quo,'' said Staab.
</P>
<P>
   Few analysts and diplomats think Schroeder will be able to push
through legislative changes the way Blair did so soon after his May
1997 landslide election. The key difference, says Stabb, is that
Blair inherited a reformed, unified party, while Schroeder's is
riven by ideological splits.
</P>
<P>
   Staab says Schroeder will be too busy trying to placate extreme
elements in his own party and their junior coalition partners, most
likely the environmentalist Green Party, to get much accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder declared Monday he will try to forge a coalition
between the Social Democrats and the Green Party, which has never
before been in government.
</P>
<P>
   While Blair enjoys the biggest parliamentary majority in Britain
in nearly two centuries, Schroeder's majority is expected to be
modest after he convenes negotiations to form a coalition
government on Friday. Schroeder will probably have a majority of 21
seats in the 672-member Bundestag.
</P>
<P>
   Blair had the political security needed to take bold
initiatives, such as making the concessions to bring about a
political settlement in Northern Ireland, and giving a degree of
home rule to Scotland and Wales.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, analysts say, Blair's commanding parliamentary
majority allowed him to try reforming the welfare system, something
that traditionally was anathema to left-wing Labor Party stalwarts.
When, in an attempt to underscore his seriousness about tackling
such reform, Blair announced he was cutting benefits to single
mothers, the left wing of his party howled, but did not have the
numbers to stop him.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's vanquished Christian Democratic Union Monday ruled out
the possibility of forming a grand coalition with Schroeder's
Social Democrats. That means Schroeder will be forced to form a
coalition with the Greens. If extreme elements in the Greens, such
as those who want Germany out of NATO and an end to nuclear power,
become obstructionists, Schroeder might not survive his four-year
term as chancellor, some analysts predict.
</P>
<P>
   What that means in practical terms, analysts say, is that
Schroeder is far less likely to even attempt the politically
difficult task of wringing concessions from labor unions that could
make Germany's economy, the third-largest in the world behind the
US and Japan, more competitive and chip away at Germany's 11
percent unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
   Even more than voters wanting a change, it was the fact that 4
million of Germany's 80 million people are out of work that helped
Schroeder oust Kohl. But unless Schroeder is able to make a dent in
that figure, analysts say, eventually he will be politically
vulnerable.

MIDEAST LEADERS, CLINTON HOLD TALKS IN WHITE HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat gathered with President Clinton in
the White House Monday for an unexpected summit, marking the most
significant sign of progress in the stagnant Middle East peace
process in nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders agreed to meet with Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and special United States envoy Dennis Ross in the region
next week, then return to Washington for an intensified working
summit in mid-October with the intention to plow through the last
obstacles to a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Amid signs of a possible breakthrough, the three leaders
projected their most optimistic tone in months. ``There has been a
significant narrowing of the gaps between the two parties across a
wide range of issues,'' Clinton told reporters during an Oval
Office photo opportunity, each leader standing at his side.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials are now thought to be amenable to a plan to
cede another 13 percent of the West Bank to Palestinian rule, with
three percent of that property to be designated as a nature
preserve, free from construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a key area,'' a US official said Monday, confirming
the Israeli concession. ``But there are several other key issues.
We are trying to translate some approaches into concrete steps.''
</P>
<P>
   In return, Israel is seeking greater assurances that
Palestinians will take stronger measures to quell terrorist threats
from Arabs, it remains murky how such assurances might take form.
Israeli officials continued to signal over the weekend that
lessening security threats remains paramount in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other contentious issues meant to be settled in
so-called final status talks are the control of Jerusalem and the
ultimate size and shape of any Palestinian state, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Monday's meeting, Netanyahu fueled expectations of an
accord by declaring on television, ``I think we're getting close to
finalizing an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, at a news conference, the Israeli leader said, ``What
we have achieved is to set up a timetable, a path to completion of
this process.'' He added separately: ``We hope we will complete it
by meeting in mid-October in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   US officials declined to discuss the specific areas where the
diplomatic chasm has narrowed, saying they did not want to violate
the process by commenting on its different steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of a diplomatic effort where these pieces are
interrelated,'' said Albright. ``Many of them operate in parallel,
and we are trying to make progress across the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, the White House fended off questions from reporters
as to why Clinton at this point summoned Arafat and Netanyahu to
the Oval Office for a dramatic trilateral meeting when no obvious
resolution was in sight. The meeting took place amid Clinton's
pledge to rededicate his efforts to governing, and against the
backdrop of a likely impeachment inquiry on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw this as an important opportunity,'' said Albright,
speaking in the White House briefing room. She said she believed it
was important to have Clinton involved, ``pushing, prodding,
suggesting and basically telling them to get on with their work.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting seemed to produce an immediate dividend of goodwill.
At the United Nations, Arafat, permitted to give his first speech
to the General Assembly, toned down his planned incendiary remarks
on forming a Palestinian state and instead couched the sentiment in
more diplomatic terms.
</P>
<P>
   The Oslo agreements that provide the framework for the peace
process expire on May 4, and Arafat was planning to tell the UN
that he would declare a Palestinian statehood after the deadline if
no accord was reached with the Israelis. Such a declaration would
have resulted in the likely collapse of any talks and could have
led to conflict in the region, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not lost hope in the peace process,'' Arafat said at
the UN. He added later, ``We will not give up our national rights
nor will we give up the inalienable rights of the Palestinian
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Arafat said, ``Our people demand of us to shoulder
our responsibilities and they wait the establishment of their
independent state. Help us to achieve the national goal of our
people and the establishment of our state.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's meeting was the result of a weekend of nearly frantic
hotel shuttle diplomacy in Manhattan between Albright and the two
Middle East leaders, who were in New York for the annual general
debate of the UN's General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary of state held two separate meetings with each
leader over the last several days, in sessions that culminated with
a three-way meeting Sunday night in Albright's suite at the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. It marked the first time that Netanyahu and
Arafat had met face-to-face in nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   At the conclusion of that meeting, Albright pushed for the
Washington summit. Netanyahu had a previously arranged meeting with
Clinton in the Oval Office Monday morning, and Arafat, who was due
in Washington later this week, was summoned to the White House to
take part.
</P>
<P>
   The three leaders met for approximately 90 minutes, aides said.
``What is important about this meeting is the increased sense of
urgency,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats, who have eyed two years of sometimes infuriating
failures at bringing the two sides together, privately agreed with
Clinton that the United States must maintain a cautious tone while
prodding the two sides to act. Warned one administration official:
``There is the recognition that this is never a done deal until
it's a done deal.''

 &HT;    CLINTON ANNOUNCES PLANNED MIDEAST SUMMIT TO JUMP-START STALLED
PEACE PROCESS
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With time running out on the prospects for
reinvigorating the long-stalled Middle East peace process,
President Clinton set plans Monday to host Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat for a
high-stakes peace summit in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   The three leaders met in the Oval Office and agreed to return in
two weeks to try to hammer out their remaining differences over the
critical issues of Palestinian security guarantees and Israeli
troop withdrawals from the occupied West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the distance that remains between Israel and the
Palestinians -- and the potential risks of a failed peace process
-- Arafat left the White House meeting to fly directly to the
United Nations, where he called for the creation of an independent
Palestinian state by May 4, an issue over which the two parties
remain deeply divided.
</P>
<P>
   ''The five-year transitional period provided for in the
Palestinian-Israeli agreements will end on the 4th of May, 1999...
and our people demand of us to shoulder our responsibilities, and
they await the establishment of their independent state,'' said
Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Israel and the international community recognize the PLO as the
legal representative of the Palestinian people. Arafat spoke as an
observer to the U.N. General Assembly, the first time a Palestinian
leader has been accorded speaker status before the assembly's
annual session of deliberation and debate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eight million Palestinians are still being deprived of their
right to exercise sovereignty over their land,'' Arafat said. ''It
is not admissible for Israel to continue dominating the Palestinian
people.''
</P>
<P>
   With the looming May 4th deadline for the implementation of the
so-called Oslo Accords, inked on the White House South Lawn five
years ago this month, Clinton has been looking for a way to
jump-start a peace process that has been essentially stalemated for
18 months.
</P>
<P>
   The peace summit Clinton announced Monday would take place three
weeks before mid-term congressional elections. A successful summit
could provide a boost to anxious Democrats struggling to divert
attention from the sex and deception scandal that has dogged
Clinton since January.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said that simply getting the three leaders
together in the same room, for the first time since early 1997, was
a badly needed step in the decades-old search for Middle East
peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have made progress on the path to peace,'' Clinton told
reporters after the 90-minute meeting. ''They have made a very
unusual commitment,'' Clinton said, by agreeing to return next
month ''to try to resolve the remaining gaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton dispatched Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and her
top Mideast envoy, Dennis Ross, to Israel next week, to try to
hammer out the parameters of next month's talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's still a substantial amount of work to be done until a
comprehensive agreement can be reached,'' Clinton cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, briefing reporters after the talks, left open the
possibility that the May 4 deadline might not be met.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Arafat and Netanyahu remained committed to the
deadline, she responded, ''There is a sense that we are working
against a general deadline, that this process needs to be speeded
up,'' before adding, ''we also know that a lot of work needs to be
done, and it needs to be done urgently.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the October summit would be a time for ''intensive and
sustained talks,'' among Clinton, Arafat and Netanyahu and their
senior diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu later told reporters he expected the talks to last
''several days,'' and he voiced optimism that an agreement could be
reached on the contentious subject of Israeli troop withdrawals
from the occupied West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't tell you that we agree on everything, that would not
be true. But I can tell you we agreed on quite a few things, and so
that, at least, is a good start,'' Netanyahu said. ''We'll see if
the Palestinians are prepared to shoulder their responsibilities
and to agree to implement them, to carry out their obligations in a
concrete way, in a specific time schedule. If that is the case, I
assure you, we'll arrive at an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House is hopeful that the October summit -- no firm
date or venue had been nailed down as of Monday -- would result in
the second of three Israeli troop withdrawals envisioned by the
Oslo process. Israeli troops withdrew from parts of Gaza and the
West Bank in 1994, turning those areas over to Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   Before the third and final withdrawal, however, a whole new set
of issues -- so called final status issues -- would remain to be
negotiated, including the thorny issue of the future of Jerusalem,
permanent borders for Palestinian and Israeli lands, and the
resettlement of some 4 million Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The hope among negotiators is that the October summit could
result in an interim agreement that would set the stage for final
status talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not the end-game, but just an opening toward the end
of the process,'' said Abraham Marcus, director of the Center for
Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Texas in Austin.
''Clearly these more complex matters have been left for the last
stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the outlook is bright for an interim agreement in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has signalled that he is willing to withdraw Israeli
troops from 13 percent of the occupied West Bank -- though he's
suggested retaining control of roughly one-fourth of that portion
and operating it as a nature preserve -- if Palestinians agree to
strengthen their internal security to prevent terrorist attacks
against Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is pretty close to a done deal,'' said Middle East expert
William Quandt, a former National Security Council official during
the Carter administration. ''The concept of the redeployment is
pretty well worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is prepared to deal, Quandt said, and Arafat ''can't
afford to let this fail,'' as his political position depends on his
being able to deliver some tangible benefits -- in this case
territory -- to his Palestinian followers.
</P>
<P>
   Quandt doubts, however, that serious final status talks will
follow.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this is the end of the road, rather than the beginning
of a new road,'' said Quandt, professor of government and
international affairs at the University of Virginia in
Charlottesville. ''Between Netanyahu and Arafat, and generally
between the Likud government (Netanyahu represents) and the PLO,
there is just an enormous gap.''

 &HT;    CLINTON ANNOUNCES PLANNED MIDEAST SUMMIT TO JUMP-START STALLED
PEACE PROCESS
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With time running out on the prospects for
reinvigorating the long-stalled Middle East peace process,
President Clinton set plans Monday to host Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat for a
high-stakes peace summit in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   The three leaders met in the Oval Office and agreed to return in
two weeks to try to hammer out their remaining differences over the
critical issues of Palestinian security guarantees and Israeli
troop withdrawals from the occupied West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the distance that remains between Israel and the
Palestinians -- and the potential risks of a failed peace process
-- Arafat left the White House meeting to fly directly to the
United Nations, where he called for the creation of an independent
Palestinian state by May 4, an issue over which the two parties
remain deeply divided.
</P>
<P>
   ''The five-year transitional period provided for in the
Palestinian-Israeli agreements will end on the 4th of May, 1999...
and our people demand of us to shoulder our responsibilities, and
they await the establishment of their independent state,'' said
Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization.

NEW GERMAN LEADER TO SEEK COALITION WITH THE GREENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also GERMANY-SCHROEDER, GERMANY-ASSESS)  
(JT) 
 By ROGER COHEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BONN _ Gerhard Schroeder, Germany's chancellor-elect, said
Monday that he would seek to form a coalition government with the
environmentalist Green Party, opening the way for the first ``Red
Green'' government in the 49-year history of the postwar republic.
</P>
<P>
   Final results in Sunday's national elections showed Schroeder's
Social Democrats and the Greens sweeping to a comfortable 21-seat
majority in the 656-member Parliament, as weariness with Helmut
Kohl's 16-year rule and anger over high unemployment prompted a
decisive vote for change.
</P>
<P>
   It was a landmark election in many senses. Germans voted a
chancellor out of office for the first time, opted for a new
generation of leaders and signaled a readiness to experiment with
an entirely new form of government. The vote suggested a country in
profound transition, one changed utterly by unification and the end
of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   A wave of enthusiasm was palpable Monday, marked by an almost
physical sense of relief that the Kohl era was over. But the
euphoria could quickly turn to grumbling if Schroeder does not show
that he can act as well as talk, and Germany's 4.1 million
unemployed do not start to find work.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, 54, said negotiations with the Greens would begin on
Friday and were ``the logical consequences of the election.'' He
expressed confidence that ``a rational program'' would be possible
with the Greens, but insisted that he would put ``caution before
haste.''
</P>
<P>
   As the premier of the northern state of Lower Saxony, Schroeder
has already worked in a coalition with the Greens. The experiment
ended unhappily in disputes over the use of nuclear power and other
issues, and he will want to be certain that a solid basis exists
for government.
</P>
<P>
   Under the German Constitution, the Bundestag must meet within 30
days of Sunday's vote to elect a chancellor by a majority.
Schroeder will therefore want to have his coalition in place, with
a program and ministerial appointments agreed, by that date.
</P>
<P>
   While other options exist _ including a so-called grand
coalition with the defeated Christian Democrats _ it appeared very
unlikely that the Social Democrats and Greens would fail to grasp
an unprecedented, and perhaps unexpected, opportunity to form a
government.
</P>
<P>
   Joschka Fischer, the most influential Green politician, said his
party was determined to find the basis for a ``solid commitment for
four years'' with the Social Democrats, and suggested that realism
and a spirit of compromise would guide the negotiations on a
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``German policies have to remain predictable,'' he said, adding
that the Greens sought ``close cooperation with our Western, and
especially our European, partners.'' Fischer has been influential
in steering the majority of the Greens back from strident calls for
Germany's withdrawal from NATO.
</P>
<P>
   If German tradition is respected, Fischer, 50, could become
foreign minister, a post generally given to the junior coalition
partner. This would amount to a remarkable appointment in a country
that less than a decade ago stood on the explosive front line of
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   As he announced his intentions, Schroeder already faced a
barrage of warnings from Germany's powerful business establishment,
which is particularly alarmed by the Greens' talk of new gasoline
taxes. The conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper said
Schroeder should conduct the talks with the Greens ``as if they
were capitulation negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Social Democrats will be in a strong position in coalition
talks because their share of the vote surged to 40.9 percent from
36.4 percent in the 1994 election, while that of the Greens fell
slightly to 6.7 percent from 7.3 percent. The Social Democrats have
298 seats in Parliament and the Greens 47 seats.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Democratic share of the vote tumbled to 35.2
percent from 41.4 percent, a reflection of Kohl's unpopularity and
his failure to grasp the fact that Germans craved a forward-looking
message.
</P>
<P>
   A conference of the Christian Democratic Party has been called
for early November and seems likely to elect Kohl's deputy,
Wolfgang Schaeuble, 56, as the new party chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder gave few indications Monday of his policies, which
remained nebulous throughout the campaign, but said Germany would
continue to support Russia's reform efforts even if he lamented the
lack of ``social balance'' there. He also said he would do
everything to insure a smooth introduction of the euro, Europe's
new currency, which is due to replace the German mark in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   In his first foreign visit since the election, Schroeder will
visit Paris on Wednesday and meet with the French president,
Jacques Chirac. The visit is clearly aimed at calming French unease
over the close relationship between Schroeder and the British prime
minister, Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   France has been alarmed by Schroeder's talk of closer ties with
Britain and by a sense that Germany is now more concerned with
broadening the European Union to bring in countries like Poland
than ``deepening'' it to make the European Union a more convincing
political power.
</P>
<P>
   In itself, the move of the capital to Berlin next year will mark
a distinct change in the center of European political gravity, and
Schroeder will have to be vigilant in reassuring Germany's allies _
and particularly France _ that the return to the Reichstag changes
nothing fundamental in Germany's view of itself, its neighbors or
the world.

NEW LEADERS SEEK WAY OUT OF THE FINANCIAL WILDERNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Since the end of the Soviet Union, Russian governments
have insisted that there was A Plan to lead the country towards
prosperity. Not the current Cabinet of Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   In the three weeks since Primakov took office, various advisers
have offered a wide range of solutions to save Russia from the
financial paralysis that set in when the previous government
devalued the ruble and defaulted on its debt payments Aug. 17. Some
have suggested paying the government's debts to workers and
industry by printing rubles; others advocate cutting government
spending and asking the International Monetary Fund for new loans.
</P>
<P>
   But if there is a consensus on anything in the new government,
it is that there is no consensus on a single plan.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, government spokesman Andrei Kratkov acknowledged that
``some of the positions'' of the Russian officials who have held
talks with the International Monetary Fund ``have not agreed with
Primakov.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, there is no official position,'' Kratkov said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, First Deputy Prime Minister Vadim Gustov said that
Russians could expect to see ``a program of anti-crisis'' measures
in the next 10 days. Gustov and other officials told reporters the
plan would involve a number of state controls aimed at supporting
domestic producers and reducing taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a spokesman for Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov,
who on Sunday issued an appeal for the IMF to release over $4
billion in new loans to Russia, said the government would unveil
its new program in Washington early next month. Zadornov has
promised to improve tax collection and reduce state spending, but
in Russia's current financial state, any harsh measure will be hard
to force on a populace tired of suffering.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin Monday fired two senior proponents of
austerity, chief tax collector Boris Fyodorov and Deputy Prime
Minister Viktor Khristenko. The firings left Zadornov as the only
senior official in the government associated with Russia's
post-Soviet efforts to transform a centralized economy to a
market-oriented one.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist-backed officials who dominate the Primakov cabinet
have suggested easing monetary policy while foregoing on
international loans altogether, on the grounds that they have not
helped the country while building up debts Russia can not pay. But
they have not explained where the country would get the money to
pay some $3 billion in debt payments that come due by the end of
the year, and as much as $19.2 billion that will be due in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   An official from Russia's Economics Ministry, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said that most likely, Russia would produce
two plans, one for domestic consumption, and one to try to appease
Western creditors who were burned by the previous government's
decision to default.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the members of the new government understand that
whatever moves they make will be terribly unpopular,'' the official
said. ``So they are trying to put off doing anything as long as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, meanwhile, has taken on the most urgent political task
his government faces: paying late wages to workers. He said at a
meeting with President Boris Yeltsin that his government had
already begun paying wage arrears to Russia's long-suffering army.
</P>
<P>
   But while heading off possible unrest by the military in a
country with 7,000 nuclear warheads is an admirable goal, many
analysts wonder where the government will get the money to pay
workers, and worry that the strategy of printing rubles will lead
to hyperinflation.
</P>
<P>
   Zadornov on Sunday said Russia could avoid inflationary
solutions to the crisis only if the IMF released the next $4.3
billion installment of the $22.6 billion rescue package
international lenders offered the country in July.
</P>
<P>
   That deal was cancelled after Aug. 17. Now the IMF and other
Western creditors are looking for signs that Russia intends to make
tax reform, cost-cutting, and responsible spending its priorities
before they offer new loans. In an interview on Ekho Moskvy radio
Monday, Martin Gilman, the head of the IMF's office in Moscow, was
asked whether the fund got a coherent sense of the Primakov
government's plans after talks that ended last week without an
agreement on new funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am afraid that the clear answer to that question is no, we
did not,'' Gilman said. &UR;  &LR;

   SMOKING-LAWSUIT (SEattle) For decades, the nation's tobacco
companies lied to consumers about the risks of smoking, including
its link to cancer, a lawyer said today during opening statements
in the state's lawsuit against seven tobacco companies. Paul
Luvera, a private attorney arguing the state's case in King County
Superior Court, said the state claim boils down to ``fundamentals
of honesty.'' The tobacco companies are selling a legal product but
doing so by illegal means, he said, aiming their marketing at
minors while deceptively hiding the health risks of smoking.

EARLIER CALIFORNIA PRIMARY UPSETS NEW ENGLAND STATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To the dismay of Massachusetts officials,
California Governor Pete Wilson signed legislation Monday to move
up his state's primary to the same date as the ``Yankee Day''
presidential vote, which could vastly reduce New England's impact
in the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a national disaster,'' Massachusetts Secretary of
State William Galvin said, asserting that California's move would
drastically compress the national primary schedule and ``certainly
diminish the influence of Massachusetts.''
</P>

   But Wilson, ignoring pleas from states that already plan to hold
a presidential primary on March 7, 2000, said California has been
ignored for too long and can only make its voice heard by moving up
the vote. Shortly after Wilson signed the bill Monday, his press
secretary, Sean Walsh, said, ``The sound you hear is the 800-pound
gorilla waking up. This could change the face of politics as we
know it.
</P>
<P>
   California's population is more than twice that of all the New
England states combined, meaning presidential candidates will spend
more of their time and money campaigning there than in New England,
where all states but New Hampshire vote in the Yankee Day primary.
California elects about one-fifth of all delegates who attend the
two parties' nominating conventions.
</P>
<P>
   The Californias change does not affect the first-in-the-nation
New Hampshire primary. State law requires that its vote be held 10
days before any other primary and some New Hampshire officials have
said California's move makes the early Granite State vote more
important than ever.
</P>
<P>
   But New Hampshire Secretary of State William Gardner was not as
optimistic Monday, saying California's action was ``bad for the
process. ... If it's not good for the country, it's not good for
New Hampshire.'' Gardner said the chance for a lesser known
candidate such as Bill Clinton or Jimmy Carter to succeed through
direct voter contact will be cut, with candidates forced to jump
from one tarmac to another while spending millions of dollars on
television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the handwringing in New England, there was agreement that
California's move would have a major impact on the nomination
process. California will join nine other states that tentatively
plan to hold the primaries on March 7, which by some estimates
could result in a one-day selection of about half the delegates
needed for the nomination. Primaries are currently scheduled on
March 7, 2000, in these states: California, Massachusetts, Vermont,
Rhode Island, Connecticut, Maine, Georgia, New York, Maryland and
Colorado. There is also a possibility that Washington and Oregon
might join the list, while some states now scheduled for March 7
may switch to later dates. Galvin said it is unlikely that a state
could opt for an earlier date because of various party rules.
</P>
<P>
   The March 7 lineup includes of states has special appeal for a
centrist Republican. That has raised suspicions that the change in
California was engineered by the moderate Wilson for his own
benefit, if he runs for the presidency in 2000. The calendar has
tended recently to benefit more conservative Republicans because
many Southern states vote in the Super Tuesday primary.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, the beneficiaries would be the
best-known and best-financed candidates who can afford the enormous
expense of advertising in California, which is why Galvin and some
others suspect the move was designed by Democrats who back the
expected candidacy of Vice President Al Gore. Gore's aides have
said the vice president had nothing to do with the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``California is such a big money state that it will make it
harder for more marginal players to compete effectively,'' said
Merle Black, professor of politics at Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, through spokesman Walsh, said that the ``the move should
be welcomed in New England.''
</P>
<P>
   ``California and the New England states have a similar cultural
diversity,'' Walsh said. ``This should somewhat change the
political strategy of running hard to the right and then tacking
back to the center after the first round of presidential
primaries.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been questions raised about whether California's new
primary could run into legal problems if the state's voters fail to
approve a November referendum measure that would change the way the
state's delegates are selected to conform with party rules. The
referendum asks voters to approve a ``closed'' primary system, in
which members of one party cannot cross lines and vote for a
candidate in another party. Without such a change, the national
parties may not recognize the results of the California primary.
</P>
<P>
   But even if voters do not approve the measure, California could
still hold a March 7 primary in what is known as a ``beauty
contest,'' with a caucus held later to pick the delegates.
California state Senator James Costa, the author of the primary
legislation, said the vote will be held on March 7 regardless of
what happens with the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary is now on the first Tuesday in March, and unless
there is a change by whoever is the next governor, it will remain
the first Tuesday in March,'' said Costa, adding that the day may
be a ``de facto national primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Galvin said he would try to get the national parties to force
California to delay its primary. At the very least, Galvin wants
the parties to create a system of rotating regional primaries.
</P>
<P>
   California Secretary of State William Jones said Monday in a
statement that he endorsed the general idea of rotating regional
primaries. Under such a system, Iowa and New Hampshire would still
go first, followed by four or five regional primary days. The
regions would rotate the order in which they hold their primaries
every four years.
</P>
<P>
   But it might take approval of all 50 states to set up such a
radical change in the primary system, and many states so far have
been unwilling to accept the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``To reform this process, all 50 states must work together to
develop a system of regional primaries that rotates every four
years to allow each state's voters to have a say in the selection
of presidential nominees,'' Jones said. But in 2000, Jones said,
California will have the earlier primary that the rules allow.

   In 1526, Babur, an Islamic prince from Central Asia, conquered
the lands now divided between northern India and Pakistan and
established the Mogul dynasty, which ruled for more than 300 years.
By 1580, ties with Europe were affecting art, politics and religion
at the Mogul court. And a new exhibition at the Smithsonian
Institution's Arthur M. Sackler Gallery in Washington illustrates
how royal artists adapted Christian imagery.
</P>
<P>
   The show, ``The Jesuits and the Grand Mogul: Renaissance Art at
the Imperial Court of India (1580-1630),'' running through April 4,
comprises 22 paintings, engravings, manuscripts and sculptures. A
few of the works were created by European artists, but most
exemplify the attempts of court artists to emulate Christian
subjects and Late Renaissance style introduced by Jesuit missions.

SCIENTISTS IDENTIFY MATERNAL INSTINCT GENE IN MICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists have created ``bad mother'' mice by knocking out a
single gene, without which the maternal instinct seemed to vanish
and the female rodents neglected their newborns.
</P>
<P>
   The finding adds to other recent evidence that much of early
mothering behavior is genetically governed _ in nonhuman mammals,
anyway _ and that a number of different genes are probably
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Humans have a version of this gene, but the researchers do not
know whether it affects the behavior of mothers.
</P>
<P>
   This gene, called Mest, is unique because the only active copy
is inherited from the father.
</P>
<P>
   The normal Mest gene in mice, ``is required for the appropriate
immediate response of females to their pups,'' wrote the authors of
the report in today's issue of Nature Genetics. Their experiment
consisted of putting an inactive, or ``knockout,'' version of the
gene in mice: the males passed on this nonfunctioning gene to their
female offspring, who turned out to be negligent mothers. They also
were smaller than normal mice, and in this respect, the gene acts
similarly in humans, causing a rare growth retardation problem when
it is mutant.
</P>
<P>
   Usually the first thing a mother mouse does is devour the
afterbirth, clean up the babies, and begin feeding them. Even
virgin female mice are driven by maternal genes: if put into a cage
with newborn mice, they will retrieve them and carry them to a nest
that they will build out of wood chips.
</P>
<P>
   But virgin mice who lacked the Mest gene failed to retrieve
newborn pups, and they ``performed poorly with regard to
nest-building,'' wrote the authors, led by Louis Lefebvre of the
Wellcome/CRC Institute of Cancer and Developmental Biology in
Cambridge, England.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, female mice lacking the gene who actually became
pregnant and gave birth tended to be derelict mothers. The majority
of them failed to eat the afterbirth and feed their pups. In fact,
many of the newborns were not even touched by their mothers, said
the scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Mest is not the only ``mothering'' gene _ three or four others
are known _ but it is ``a novel finding'' because it is only active
when it is inherited from the father, commented Robert Bridges, a
professor in biomedical sciences at Tufts University School of
Veterinary Medicine in North Grafton.
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon is called ``imprinting.'' Offspring inherit two
copies of a gene, one from each parent. When only the gene from the
mother or the father is active, that is imprinting.
</P>
<P>
   Why the Mest gene is imprinted is not known, but Bridges
suggests an evolutionary explanation: ``It's one mechanism by which
the male can affect his offspring's behavior toward its young.''
Perhaps males that contributed highly effective Mest genes were
more successful in reproducing, says Bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Like all genes, the Mest gene makes a single protein. How does
that protein determine a female mouse's varied mothering behaviors,
from eating the afterbirth to retrieving lost pups? That remains
something of a mystery, but the findings are in line with other
recent gene research on parental behavior, Bridges. Other mouse
genes have been knocked out, including those that code for proteins
known as FosB, dopamine beta-hydroxylase, and the prolactin
receptor, causing similar poor mothering behavior, Bridges said.
</P>
<P>
   One suggestion has been that these gene defects might render the
mice incapable of smelling their young. But tests indicate that is
not the problem, and the researchers who knocked out the Mest gene
checked for that, too.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists do know, however, that the Mest gene mainly acts
in the brain and nervous system. As scientists follow this and
other leads, commented Bridges, they may be able to ``further
dissect the genetic basis of maternal behavior and determine, more
precisely, what a mother should know.''

CURE FOR A CRUSH: BE SINCERE AND EARNEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CARYN JAMES 
  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Felicity'' is set in motion by one of life's archetypal
experiences: the hopeless, dumbstruck, high-school crush. On
graduation day, the shy, smart Felicity asks the handsome, popular
Ben to sign her yearbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched you for four years, always wondered what you were
like,'' he writes. He signs it, ``Love, Ben,'' and walks away.
Felicity chucks her parents' stifling plan for her to go to nearby
Stanford premedical school and follows Ben to the fictional
University of New York (New York University in all but name).
</P>
<P>
   It takes no time for the series to arrive at its defining
moment. At registration, Ben spots Felicity, smiles, and kisses the
girl he is with. If ``Felicity'' were ``Ally McBeal,'' this is the
point at which we would see a stake being driven through her heart.
Instead, ``Felicity'' delivers piercing realism; she pretends
everything is all right.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has gone through some similar heart-shattering event,
though the girls in the show's target audience are more likely to
be cultivating a crush on Hanson than dealing with real-life love
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The one series to be preordained a hit by advertisers and
critics, ``Felicity'' piles on the ingredients of success so deftly
it is likely to join the WB's list of hit teen-age-oriented shows.
To underscore the connections, ``Felicity'' will have its premiere
Tuesday night in its regular time slot, after ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer,'' and will be repeated Wednesday, after ``Dawson's Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   As in those shows, all the characters in ``Felicity'' are
unimaginably good-looking, articulate and involved in complicated
friendships that could veer from platonic to something more any
second, if only they could sort things out.
</P>
<P>
   With her clear-eyed gaze and Pre-Raphaelite hair, Felicity (Keri
Russell) is immensely likable yet down to earth as she struggles to
stand up for herself. Ms. Russell's sincerity and naturalness take
the curse off the series' calculated, prepackaged feel.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the triangle is just as engaging. Ben (Scott
Speedman) is an instantly recognizable real-life type, the
thoughtless charmer; he might have a soul beneath that charm. Noel
(Scott Foley) is the thoughtful, energetic resident assistant in
Felicity's dorm. He develops as hopeless a crush on her as she has
on Ben.
</P>
<P>
   Though Felicity is shaken when she realizes Ben is not
interested in her, she is resilient and tries to be friends with
him. He quickly asks if she would mind his dating her new friend
Julie. This is the moment when, if Felicity were Ally, she'd
imagine herself jumping off a bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Though it has plenty of winning qualities, ``Felicity'' also has
an earnestness that sets it apart from the tongue-in-cheek
``Buffy'' and from ``Dawson's Creek,'' a soap opera laden with
sardonic pop-culture references.
</P>
<P>
   Such wry qualities give those shows an appeal to viewers over
15. But like adolescence, ``Felicity'' is loaded with many intense,
heartfelt conversations, maybe too many for a grown-up audience to
bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're acting crazy, all I did was be nice to you,'' Ben yells
at Felicity. ``How could you think you're in love with me, you
don't even know me!''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the first episode, Felicity realizes Ben was
simply her excuse to be on her own, a continent away from her
parents. And maybe, if viewers are lucky, eventually she'll lighten
up and realize she's in college, not on death row. &QL;

TENSIONS RISE IN DIVIDED HEBRON AS GUNMEN OPEN FIRE ON ISRAELI
SETTLERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEBRON, West Bank _ Palestinian gunmen opened fire on a group of
settlers in this divided West Bank town Monday, injuring an Israeli
woman hours before negotiators took their first strides in months
toward a long-awaited peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said a group of settlers was passing by the Jewish
enclave of Beit Hadassah, lodged at the edge of the
Israeli-controlled part of the city, when shots rang out from the
Palestinian-controlled area of the city. A woman was injured in the
leg.
</P>
<P>
   In response, about 20 angry settlers stormed a nearby
Palestinian vegetable market, where they overturned carts and beat
up Arab passers-by. One Arab woman was injured in the melee,
according to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very upset,'' said David Wilder, a Hebron settler
spokesman. ``We feel that the security forces should be taking more
active measures to protect us.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident increased tensions between the 400 settlers lodged
in the heart of this biblical city and their unwilling Palestinian
hosts, and it underscored the danger of violence even as their
respective leaders, meeting in the United States, inched toward a
deal on Israeli troop withdrawal from West Bank territory.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, President Clinton met with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat to push
for an agreement that would put an additional 13 percent of
territory under Palestinian control in return for greater
Palestinian security guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said progress had been made toward an agreement, but he
declined to give details. Instead, he said he would send Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright and special envoy Dennis Ross to the
region next month to fine-tune a deal that could pave the way for
another three-way summit in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   An accord would help pull peace negotiations out of a 19-month
freeze and bring the two sides one step closer to talks on the
stickier issue of Palestinian statehood. But in divided Hebron,
hatred between settlers and Palestinians was hardly on the way out.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1997, Israel pulled its troops out of 80 percent of
the city. Its soldiers stayed in the other 20 percent, where some
20,000 Palestinians live, to protect settlers who live in five tiny
enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Palestinian police patrol their part of the city, a
bustling metropolis full of outdoor markets, crowded office
buildings and sandstone homes. Concertina wire, army checkpoints
and blue-and-white flags mark the Israeli-controlled area. Coils of
barbed wire separate settlement enclaves from Palestinian homes
next door.
</P>
<P>
   Since the city split, relations between these unwilling
neighbors have been tense. Palestinians often complain that the
settlers, among the most militant in the West Bank, provoke them.
And they believe that the settlers' presence is merely an excuse
for continued military occupation of their city.
</P>
<P>
   The settlers accuse the Palestinians of using their newly
acquired territory as a launching pad for attacks against them.
Monday's incident caps a month of particularly intense violence
here. Last week, Palestinians opened fire on a settler van outside
Kiryat Arba, a 5,000-strong settlement just outside Hebron. The
driver escaped uninjured. Last month, a Palestinian broke into a
home in the Hebron enclave of Tel Romeida and stabbed a 63-year-old
rabbi, Shlomo Ranan, to death. Israel responded by clamping a
10-day curfew on the Palestinians living under its control and
barring all Palestinians, even those living under self-rule, from
leaving the city.
</P>
<P>
   Those incidents, say settlers, prove the folly of turning any
more land over to Palestinians. ``We think it's absurd that we give
them more land when all they are going to do is use it to attack
us,'' said David Wilder, a settler spokesman in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either they attack us from their territory or they attack us
in our area and then run back to their area,'' he said. ``To give
them more area from which to attack us just does not make any sense
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, settler leaders dispatched two of their emissaries to
the United Nations in New York to try to forestall an
Israeli-Palestinian agreement on further troop withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is critical and so we asked our senior soldiers
to pack their suitcases quickly and fly to New York to speak to
Netanyahu,`` Aharon Domb, a leader of an umbrella settler
organization called Yesha, told Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the territory scheduled to come under Palestinian
control should a deal go through apparently lies in the Judean
desert between Hebron and Jerusalem. Netanyahu has said that 10
percent of the land can be turned over to Palestinians without
posing a ``security danger'' to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   He said the remaining 3 percent, should it come under
Palestinian control, poses some security danger. Therefore, Israel
insisted on designating the area a ``nature reserve'' in which it
would have overriding security responsibility and on which
Palestinians would be barred from building.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians reportedly have accepted the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian claim to territory echoed another Arab claim to
land that precipitated clashes with Israel. On Monday,
Israeli-Arabs in the village of Umm al-Fahm, a town north of Tel
Aviv, scuffled with Israeli soldiers for the second straight day
over a plot of land in the village that the army plans to use as a
training camp. The residents threw stones and gasoline bombs at
police, who responded with baton charges and fired what Israeli
officials said were rubber-coated bullets and tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of land expropriation is sensitive to Israel's 800,000
Arabs whose shrinking towns and villages have lost out to Israeli
construction plans since creation of the Israeli state in 1948.

GOOD INTENTIONS GOING HORRIBLY AWRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Frontline'' offers a tour de force Tuesday night. Short on
pictures of the October 1993 firefight in the Somali capital,
``Ambush in Mogadishu'' provides a compelling account through the
memories of United States Army Rangers who found themselves pinned
down for 17 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen Americans were killed _ the most memorable picture was
of a body being dragged through the streets _ and scores more
wounded, with enduring consequences for American foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute program begins with a well-meant United Nations
effort to take food and stability to the chaos of civil war in
Somalia. But the killing of 12 Pakistani peacekeepers set off a
manhunt for Mohammed Farah Aidid, a powerful and elusive warlord;
the United States, with a mission meant to be limited both in
duration and scope, became a target in a confusing civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of blame is distributed by the military officers and
intelligence specialists interviewed here. They fault the Clinton
administration's testy relations with the Pentagon, friction within
the United Nations forces and faulty intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   There seem, too, to have been mixed signals in Washington. It is
reported that no one told the commanders in Mogadishu, who were
under pressure to capture Mohammed Aidid, that President Jimmy
Carter had been entrusted to work out a secret deal with the
warlord. (Administration officials declined to talk to
``Frontline.'')
</P>
<P>
   The raid by Rangers and Army Delta Special Forces, following up
on a dubious tip from a Somali informer, turned into disaster when
a Blackhawk helicopter was shot down and the Americans who came to
the rescue were trapped. ``Wait a minute,'' an American soldier
says. ``It's not supposed to work like this, you know. We're
Americans, you know: we're the ones dictating the game here.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the second half of ``Ambush in Mogadishu'' is given to a
description of the fighting as the Rangers moved into the mazelike
alleys to save the downed helicopter crew only to find themselves
under heavy fire from the Aidid gunmen who were waiting for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just crazy,'' one Ranger says. ``We were getting shot
from all over the place.'' Another says, ``There were Rangers with
blood on their uniforms, people looking haggard and tired. There
was just carnage.'' (The Somalis say they lost 350 fighters.)
</P>
<P>
   The program suggests that a legacy of Somalia, which one of
Tuesday night's critics calls ``a failed political military
operation,'' was the reluctance of Washington to be drawn into
other danger spots like Bosnia and Rwanda. One critic says policy
makers were left ``actually not knowing what to do at all.'' &QL;

SPECIALISTS PROPOSE AUTO INSURANCE RATE CUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Massachusetts insurance commissioner's staff urged
her Monday to approve a cut in auto rates for next year rather than
go along with the 15.5 percent average increase being sought by the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   While the State Rating Bureau, a unit within the Division of
Insurance, was unable to specify the exact size of the proposed
rate cut, it said its recommendations taken as a whole would
demonstrate that a decrease was warranted for the fifth year in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   Robert MacNicholl, acting director of the bureau, called the
insurance industry's 15.5 percent request ``excessive and
unreasonable.'' He said it was difficult to reconcile the fact that
insurance companies are offering double-digit discounts to
consumers and at the same time asking state regulators for a
double-digit increase in basic rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two things just seem to us to be very inconsistent,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau's recommendation leaves Insurance Commissioner Linda
Ruthardt with a lot of latitude as she begins deliberating on next
year's rates. A decision is expected by mid-December.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is the only state where regulators set all aspects
of auto insurance rates. Ruthardt is supposed to act much like a
judge, ruling on filings made by the industry, the State Rating
Bureau, and the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   This year's rate case is already taking on political overtones,
as the two candidates for governor, Acting Governor Paul Cellucci
and Attorney General Scott Harshbarger, have criticized the
industry's request.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, who appoints the insurance commissioner, has said the
insurance industry's rate request will be rejected. Harshbarger has
called the requested increase ``completely unreasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger filed his rate package Friday, but has taken no
position on the overall rate for next year. Assistant Attorney
General George Dean said Harshbarger will probably push for a rate
cut. He declined to speculate on the exact size of the cut,
although he said it would be less than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When the state's insurers filed their rate request in August,
they said a steep hike was needed to make up for lost revenue from
four years of rate reductions. The industry's request would raise
the average car owner's premiums by $130, from $835 to $965.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Johnston, president of the Automobile Insurers Bureau of
Massachusetts, said a major reason for the increase was the rising
cost of repairing cars as consumers buy more expensive vehicles. He
said the cost of the average repair is $1,482, up 15.5 percent from
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Other industry officials have said the good-driver and group
discounts that have been offered to consumers over the last few
years have come out of company reserves. The officials said
companies have been forced to offer the discounts to avoid losing
customers to other firms.
</P>
<P>
   MacNicholl, whose staff was scrambling to put the finishing
touches on its rate filing last night, said the agency differed
with insurers in a number of areas. MacNicholl said insurers were
overestimating their losses, seeking excessive profit levels,
asking for more money for expenses than in past years, and doing
too little to contain costs.

MPETI OLE SURUM, AT 33; KENYAN WHO LECTURED ON MASAI CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A memorial service will be held Sunday, Oct. 4 for
Mpeti Ole ``Tom'' Surum of Wellesley and Nairagie Enkare, Kenya, a
``wandering warrior'' of the Masai Tribe who killed his first lion
when he was 15 years old and later delivered cultural presentations
on his nomadic tribe to tourists in his homeland and cultural
groups in Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Surum, who was the subject of ``The Wandering Warrior,'' a
documentary which has been telecast on public television, died
Sept. 4 in an automobile accident on the Naroik-Maii Mahiu Road in
Kenya. He was 33.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Surum, was born into a traditional Masai family in Kenya. As
a child, he led a nomadic life, tending cattle and following the
grass and rain across the savannah.
</P>
<P>
   As a rite of passage to manhood, he killed a lion. ``I was about
15 years old when I killed my first lion,'' he said in a story
published in the Globe's West Weekly section on Jan. 2, 1994.
``Actually, I was lucky enough to kill two.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was 19, he met a group of Americans on a wildlife safari
who encouraged him to attend school to learn to read and write.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard convincing the elders that I should be allowed to
pursue an education,'' he said. ``Finally, though, I made them see
that they would not lose me to the West, but be enriched by the
knowledge I could bring back. ''
</P>
<P>
   He entered kindergarten in Kenya as a 6-foot-tall teenager and
claimed to have quickly made friends with his 5-year-old
classmates. Three years later he graduated from the eighth grade
and found work in a tourist lodge, washing dishes and cutting grass
before becoming a lecturer on Masai culture. He soon was delivering
a couple of lectures a day to guests.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, he was sent on a publicity tour to London, where he
appeared on several BBC news shows. This led to a promotional visit
to Boston for British Airways. He had been based in the Boston area
ever since, conducting his programs to local cultural groups under
the sponsorship of Young Audiences for Massachusetts and other
groups.
</P>
<P>
   He delivered his one-hour programs on Masai music, dance, and
storytelling while clad in an ochre cape and tunic, with a spear
grasped firmly in one hand. His performances promoted a message of
self-esteem. ``The Masai are taught that love and respect come
together,'' he said in 1994. ``When you respect yourself, you can
respect others.''
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Lynn Turner Surum; a son, Roderick; his
parents, Moitalel Naaigilong and Kimanyisho Surum; and 15 brothers
and sisters.

HARVARD PILGRIM, STATE AGREE ON A COMPROMISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ Harvard Pilgrim Health Care and state officials
announced Monday an agreement &UR;  &LR; to delay for one year Harvard
Pilgrim's plan to limit prescription drug benefits for seniors
currently enrolled with the health maintenance organization.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was aimed at reducing public confusion that could
result from conflicting federal and state regulations over whether
Massachsuetts Medicare HMOs must offer unlimited drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's compromise proposal, which requires federal approval,
would buy more time for Harvard Pilgrim and state officials to sort
out whether the insurer must comply with a state law that mandates
unlimited drug benefits to seniors in Medicare HMOs. At issue is
whether a 1997 federal law to take effect this year exempts
Medicare HMOs from state laws. The question is now in federal
courts &UR;  &LR; and could take months to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Harvard Pilgrim and state officials have agreed
to &UR;  &LR; ``grandfather'' existing members into an HMO with unlimited
drug benefit while imposing limited drug benefits for new members.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, however, could be torpedoed by federal officials. The
US Health Care Financing Administration, which regulates Medicare
HMOs, earlier this year vetoed a similar plan from Harvard Pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   State officials, including Division of Insurance Commissioner
Linda Ruthardt and Attorney General Scott Harshbarger, said they
will try this week to broker a waiver from HCFA, or at least obtain
a one-year delay in implementing the new federal rule &UR;  &LR; to exempt
HMOs from state mandates. If successful, the state said it hopes to
persuade other HMOs to agree to a similar deal. Tufts Health Plan,
which has the state's largest Medicare HMO with nearly 83,000
seniors, and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts have
indicated that they are also prepared to limit drug benefits for
the elderly starting Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   A HCFA spokesman declined to comment, saying the agency had not
yet received notice of the new Harvard Pilgrim proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the outcome of the proposal, industry and state
officials say they are going ahead with separate lawsuits aimed at
definitively settling the matter in federal courts. The state last
week sued Harvard Pilgrim to try to force the HMO to continue to
offer unlimited drug benefits. At the same time, the Massachusetts
Association of HMOs filed a lawsuit arguing that Medicare HMOs are
exempt from state requirements due to a 1997 federal law.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of efforts under way to make sure we do what's
in the best interest for all seniors,'' said Robert Hughes of the
Massachusetts Association of HMOs. ``There don't seem to be any
easy choices out there. But as long as everyone is still talking,
that's a plus.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim's plan would allow seniors enrolled in its First
Seniority Medicare HMO as of Dec. 31 to receive unlimited drug
benefits in 1999, according to Ellen Offner, vice president of
Medicare programs at Harvard Pilgrim. The HMO said it has not yet
calculated the premium for that plan. Seniors who enroll after Dec.
31 will have drug benefits capped at $200 a quarter. Most seniors,
with the exception of those living in Western Massachusetts, will
pay nothing for the limited benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates applauded the effort, but said Harvard
Pilgrim should extend unlimited drug benefits to all seniors, not
just those who sign up before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a positive move for Harvard Pilgrim, and we urge other
Medicare HMOs in Massachusetts to do the same,'' said Laurie
Martinelli of Health Law Advocates, a public interest law group
that represents consumers. ``However, having a two-tiered system is
going to exacerbate confusion.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``I haven't thought about Monica Lewinsky all
day,'' mused Wright Andrews, a Washington lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   He has been too busy. While the rest of Washington has been
obsessing over the president's sex scandal, Andrews and dozens of
other business lobbyists were working on bankruptcy legislation
that passed the Senate on Wednesday. Kenneth Starr's $40 million
investigation may have dominated the headlines and caused misery
for President Clinton, but the $40 million already spent on
lobbying by the credit card, banking and retailing industries could
affect millions of consumers by making it much tougher to declare
personal bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   This year has also, separately, been a banner year for K Street,
the power corridor of law and lobbying firms in downtown
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with massive lobbying earlier in the year by the
cigarette industry to crush a comprehensive tobacco bill, followed
by the lobbying to influence major banking and bankruptcy
legislation and the lobbying yet to come on appropriations, trade
and tax measures, Wright and many lobbyists interviewed in recent
months predict more will be spent on influencing the federal
government this year than the record $1.2 billion that was
reportedly spent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   This rapid growth in spending has brought with it the rise of a
new lobbying elite. At a time when the Democratic administration
and the Republican Congress are often at loggerheads and
Washington's agenda, dominated by scandal, seems inert, K Street's
portfolio has never been more robust, with multimillion-dollar
lobbying campaigns on issues like product liability law, health
care and computer privacy.
</P>
<P>
   They are issues that do not necessarily receive a lot of media
attention though they affect millions of people. All last week, for
example, while the klieg lights were focused on the House Judiciary
Committee, swarms of tax lobbyists were criss-crossing Gucci Gulch,
the hallways outside the House Ways and Means Committee, in an
effort to preserve an array of business tax breaks in the House's
$80 million tax-cut package.
</P>
<P>
   The influence industry had already been on a growth curve in the
1980s, but it has exploded in recent years with the advent of a
divided government. A new cast of Republican congressional
committee and subcommittee chairmen, as well as Washington's
increasing impact on highly regulated industries like financial
services, telecommunications and health care, has meant that
corporations and lobbying companies are reaching much deeper into
the bureaucracy in order to wield influence.
</P>
<P>
   When Kenneth Kies left his congressional staff position last
winter for a million-dollar offer to lobby for
PricewaterhouseCoopers, congressional committee chairmen, senior
Treasury Department and White House officials and lobbyists all
turned out for a lavish farewell fete for Kies in the House Ways
and Means Committee room, a testament to his connectedness.
</P>
<P>
   The eye-popping salary package for Kies, a 46-year-old
Republican tax lawyer who earned $132,000 as chief of staff of the
Joint Committee on Taxation, was fresh evidence of a culture of
money that in the 1990s has begun to transform Washington's old
image as a power city.
</P>
<P>
   Another bureaucrat who was unknown outside Washington, Bruce
Merlin Fried, a senior administrator for Medicare and Medicaid
programs at the Department of Health and Human Services, was also
courted like a superstar when he left the government last January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was representing Michael Jordan,'' said Susan
Schneider, a legal headhunter who helped Fried choose among plum
jobs at law and lobbying firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demand for knowledgeable people who can track what is
going on on Capitol Hill and the government and can figure out the
pressure points that companies should be touching in Washington has
greatly increased,'' said Richard Shapiro, executive director of
the Congressional Management Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Almost anyone with significant political connections, including
the spouses, family members and former aides of lawmakers, is
highly marketable on K Street. Michelle Laxalt, for example, the
daughter of Paul Laxalt, a former Republican senator, is sought
after as a lobbyist for her Senate connections.
</P>
<P>
   Boutique firms that specialize in lobbying a single member or a
single committee of Congress have also sprouted up and are
flourishing. Ann Eppard, who for 22 years served as a top aide to
Bud Shuster, the House Transportation Committee chairman, is one
who left her job in 1994 and hung out her shingle as a
transportation lobbyist. Within months, she had lined up more than
$1 million in retainers from an array of big transportation
companies, including the FDX Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Some denizens of the capital believe that K Street's explosion
has fundamentally changed the atmosphere, a new obsession with
money eclipsing Washington's traditional obsession with power.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York was money, Los Angeles was glamour and Washington was
always power,'' Victor Kamber, a lobbyist and a political
consultant for 32 years whose firm billed $11 million last year.
``Now this town is as much about money as power.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dollars on Parade &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Washington has long been one of the nation's wealthiest
metropolitan areas, with a large population of government workers
and white collar professionals. But its elite, led by a stratum of
highly paid lawyers and lobbyists, has never been as brazen in
advertising its money or political connections.
</P>
<P>
   At the Capital Grille, an expensive restaurant that opened near
the Capitol in 1994, lobbyists flaunt their clients and their
expensive tastes with brass name plaques on private wine lockers.
So many wealthy Washingtonians have begun buying second homes along
Maryland's once-quaint Eastern Shore that some areas are taking on
the congested feeling on summer weekends of the Hamptons on Long
Island. And a new glossy magazine, Capital Style, regularly
profiles the lives of Washington's rich and famous.

FED SEEN LIKELY TO CUT RATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Federal Reserve appears ready to cut interest
rates Tuesday in a move designed to ward off global economic
troubles and buoy shaky US financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   A rate cut, if it comes, will be the first by the central bank
in almost three years, and will occur at a time when by most
conventional measures the economy is in little need of lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the Fed is still likely to act because of mounting
worries that the 14-month-old global crisis has finally begun
hurting the US economy and, perhaps as importantly, that a group of
big-betting speculators, which includes hedge fund Long-Term
Capital Management LP, have gotten themselves in such trouble that
they could damage US markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real economy does not require a rate cut, period,'' said
Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting center at
Georgia State University. ``This is all about helping these hedge
funds liquidate their positions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The only debate among most Fed watchers Monday was over how
large a rate cut to expect. Most observers predicted the central
bank will trim the federal funds rate, the rate at which banks make
short-term loans to each other, by one-quarter of a percentage
point, altgough a few said the cut could be as large as one-half a
percentage point. Several also speculated that a cut might also
involve the discount rate, the rate at which banks can borrow from
the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever prediction turns out to be right, the central bank's
move will have only a modest, immediate effect on market interest
rates, and will serve mainly as a symbolic gesture. &UR;  &LR; ``The Fed will
be signalling that it intends to prevent the global economy from
falling into recession,'' said Wiliam Dudley, a senior US economist
with Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's policy making Federal Open Market Committee has
maintained the federal funds rate at 5.50 percent since March,
1997. The discount rate is 5.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For ordinary Americans, the Fed's about-face on the US economy's
condition has been nothing short of dizzying. Only last summer,
Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan was telling Congress that
the economy's preformance was ``as impressive as any I have
witnessed'' in a half century, and suggesting that if the central
bank did anything, it might raise rates to fend off renewed
inflation. As recently as the beginning of this month, Greenspan
was saying that the Fed was as likely as not to leave rates
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   As if that weren't confusing enough, analysts said the economy
is still doing well by most standard measures, with consumer
spending and confidence continuing to ride high while unemployment
remains at near-record lows.
</P>
<P>
   But a string of events in the last month have shaken policy
makers' conviction the United States can escape the global upheaval
unscathed. Russia devalued its currency and defaulted on a
substantial fraction of its debt. Brazil and other Latin American
countries, experienced a run on their finacial markets. And here,
regulators orchestrated a privately financed rescue package for
Long-Term Capital in a move that many saw as a sign of worry about
US financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's almost a total disconnect between current conditions
and what everybody expects, or worries, will happen,'' said Mark M.
Zandi, chief economist of Regional Financial Asociates in West
Chester, Pa. ``I can't remember a time when the gap was wider, and
people's assessment changed so fast,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zandi and others said that if, as expected, the Fed approves an
interest rate cut, it will be entering largely uncharted waters.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank has generally made preemptive policy moves,
such as a rate cut, when it was worried about inflation, not an
economic slowdown. It has almost always acted to help only the US
economy, but in this case will be seeking to help the global
economy as well.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, for much of the current boom, Greenspan has sought
to temper enthusiasm for the stock market with warnings about
``overexuberance,'' something that analysts said a rate cut could
re-ignite.

 WASHINGTON: and famous.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nothing seems to restrain this new culture. Not tighter
revolving door rules signed by Clinton that lengthened the time
that some lobbyists must refrain from lobbying their old agencies.
Not a gift ban passed by the Congress to loosen the knot of
friendship between lobbyists and lawmakers. Not even a major
fund-raising scandal in which some of the city's premier lobbyists,
including Haley Barbour, a former Republican Party chairman, and
Peter Knight, a Democratic fund-raiser, were brought before
congressional committees.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most expensive lobbying campaigns have been aimed at
making sure nothing happens, like the $100 million spent to kill
anti-tobacco legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the best lobbyists are like paid assassins,'' said
Jennifer Shecter of the Center for Responsive Politics, a research
group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists have always been part of the capital's political
fabric, but have never before been so intimately interwoven into
the government. Twenty years ago, for example, most Washington law
firms did little or no lobbying. Now virtually all of them have
bustling lobbying practices, and some firms have even hired
non-lawyers to increase their political clout.
</P>
<P>
   In his fight against impeachment, Clinton has reached out to a
network of Democratic lobbyists, lawyers and political consultants,
including Thomas Hale Boggs Jr., Jody Powell, Joseph O'Neill and
Anthony Podesta, who participate in a daily conference call with
the White House to plot strategy. This daily bull session is
organized by Steve Ricchetti, who recently returned to the White
House after leaving to become a lobbyist. Both Vice President Al
Gore and House Speaker Newt Gingrich have tight coteries of
lobbyists who regularly advise them on political matters.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Phillips, the political analyst who wrote ``Arrogant
Capital,'' worried that Washington had become what the Founding
Fathers feared, a ``capital so privileged and incestuous in its
dealings, that average citizens believe it is no longer accessible
to the general public.'' Phillips added that there was nothing like
Washington's ``massive, permanent lobbying elite'' in other foreign
capitals.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign countries, in fact, feel it is necessary to hire
Washington lobbyists to have their voices heard. Tiny Azerbaijan is
currently interviewing firms, even though the small republic has an
embassy in Washington and limited resources. The reason? Its
neighbors have Washington lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   At least 128 former members of Congress are now working as
lobbyists. Although some members found solace on K Street after
they were defeated for re-election, others have left office because
they were offered giant salary increases to become lobbyists. In
1993 and 1994, Willis Gradison, an Ohio Republican, and Glenn
English, an Oklahoma Democrat, stepped down from their House seats
in the middle of their terms for lucrative lobbying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, only 3 percent of the lawmakers who retired moved
to K Street; in the 1990s, 23 percent of those leaving have become
lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Even Robert Strauss, at age 80 perhaps the most seasoned member
of a generation of Democratic superlawyers, is amazed at how fast
the revolving door spins. A former Democratic Party chairman and
U.S. trade representative, Strauss said in a recent interview that
lawyers now often go to work for the government for a few years,
not because they want a career in public service, but because
``they know that enables them to move on out in a few years and
become associated with a lobbying or law firm and their services
are in tremendous demand.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the long hours and lean salaries of congressional
aides have always led to turnover, but not this much, according to
the congressional Management Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, for example, most administrative assistants in the
House, the highest-ranking aides, had spent 5.5 years working in
the Congress. In 1996, the average tenure had dropped to 4 years.
The length of tenure of senior Senate staffers has also dropped. In
a recent foundation survey, 58 percent of departing congressional
staffers cited a desire to earn more money as their reason for
wanting to leave; it was the second most frequent response given
after a desire to pursue a different type of work.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Million-Dollar Man &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting firm that hired Kies to
lobby on tax issues for its clients, may have already recouped its
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring and summer, Kies led a lobbying blitz for some of
the biggest names in corporate America, including the General
Electric Co., to maintain a tax break. The loophole, which Kies'
old committee estimated would cost $1.8 billion in federal revenue
over 10 years, allows U.S. corporations to reduce taxes on their
overseas operations. Kies headed a team of 10 other
PricewaterhouseCoopers analysts and lobbyists in a successful
effort to maintain the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   When the Treasury Department announced its intention to close
the loophole, Kies swung into action, meeting many times with with
top Treasury officials, including Lawrence Summers, the deputy
treasury secretary. ``We spent hours and hours with Donald Lubick,
the assistant secretary for tax policy,'' Kies said in a recent
interview. Kies dealt with both men at the Joint Tax Committee,
which evaluates the tax implications of all legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Kies pushed hard with a central argument: that the provision was
not really a loophole and would not result in a revenue loss from
multinational companies shifting more of their operations overseas.
Using Rube Goldberg-like diagrams that Kies likes to draw to
illustrate complex tax issues, he carried the day. In June, the
Treasury Department decided not to make the change, at least for
the time being.
</P>
<P>
   It also helped Kies that his old boss, the House Ways and Means
Chairman Bill Archer, and other influential Republican tax writers,
weighed in on his side. Federal lobbying laws prohibit Kies from
lobbying Archer or his old committee for one year after his
departure, but those statutes are not much of an impediment. Former
officials simply design the lobbying strategy and then let their
clients or colleagues do the direct lobbying until their one-year
cooling-off period is over.
</P>
<P>
   Coming from Ways and Means, Kies had free rein to lobby at
Treasury, but on his team, which included lobbyists from other
firms, was a former Treasury Department official.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Kies said that the old-fashioned stereotype of
a back-slapping lobbyist trading on friendships is outmoded. Much
of his time is spent crunching numbers and persuading Treasury
officials and lawmakers that his analysis is on target. Of course,
his political connections count, too, but Kies said of his old
bosses, Archer and William V. Roth Jr., the Senate finance
chairman: ``Archer and Roth generally do what they believe is
right. They don't do things because someone who's a buddy of theirs
comes to see them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, an aide to Archer, added: ``There are scores of
top-notch lobbyists who have relationships but who don't have the
great knowledge to go beyond a handshake. Ken Kies is an exception.
He's a well-respected expert on tax law and he came to be one of
the Hill's most admired strategists.''

 WASHINGTON: admired strategists. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the top aide at the Joint Tax Committee, Kies supervised a
staff of more than 60. Almost every line of the massive tax bill
passed last year was written by Kies. A year earlier, he helped
break a three-year stalemate on how to make health coverage
portable.
</P>
<P>
   Without confirming or denying his salary, Kies stressed that he
would have been making the same amount if he had stayed in the
private sector instead of spending years on a government salary. At
Baker &AMP; Hostetler, the Cleveland law firm where he practiced tax
law before 1994, he was earning $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole world was bidding for him and he's worth far more
than the great salary he is making,'' said a former Ways and Means
Committee member, Guy Vander Jagt, who worked with Kies when he was
a congressional staff member earlier in his career and who later
practiced law with him at Baker &AMP; Hostetler. Vander Jagt tried but
failed to woo Kies back to the firm.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Show Us the Money &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It has been nearly 15 years since Michael Deaver, a former
Reagan White House aide turned lobbyist, sparked a firestorm by
posing for an infamous Time Magazine cover article that showed him
flaunting his multimillion-dollar accounts and pictured him riding
in a limousine. But earlier this year, Washingtonian Magazine, a
glossy journal that caters to the city's professional elite, had no
trouble rounding up many of the city's 50 top lobbyists to pose for
a group photo accompanying an article titled, ``Show Me the
Money!'' Though he was not in the picture, Deaver is still a
successful lobbyist at one of the city's premier public relations
firms.
</P>
<P>
   The nexus of lobbying and campaign fund-raising, which lawmakers
and lobbyists used to make efforts to conceal, has also never been
more graphically displayed. It is no coincidence that some of
Washington's most successful lobbyists, like Barbour and Daniel
Dutko, a close adviser to Vice President Al Gore, are also leading
fund-raisers for their respective parties.
</P>
<P>
   Half of all political action committee contributions to federal
candidates and parties, meanwhile, flow from Washington, with many
donors listing zip codes in the K Street corridor. Two dozen
lobbyists interviewed said they received hundreds of fund-raising
solicitations from congressmen and their parties last year, some
closely timed after a lobbying meeting with a particular lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can almost count on getting some kind of fund-raising
solicitation after you've been to the Hill,'' said one lobbyist who
insisted he not be named. ``The time in between has gotten shorter
and shorter and it's gotten more and more brazen.''
</P>
<P>
   When Andrews, the business lobbyist, recently signed up a trade
association of home equity lenders as a client, one of the first
pieces of advice he gave the association was to establish a
political action committee. ``Under the current system, campaign
giving and fund-raising are essential,'' he said. ``When it isn't
done, it's noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporate interests who finance the largest portion of
Washington's lobbying are fortifying their influence with record
campaign contributions to federal lawmakers. Even as the House
moved to ban large contributions to the political parties, known as
soft money, the national political parties scooped up $115 million
in these big donations from business and other interests over the
last 18 months, more than double the amount raised during a
comparable period in the last non-presidential election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp., which opened a Washington office only three
years ago but now has one of the largest fleets of lobbyists _ more
than a dozen people and firms _ recently signed on through one of
its executives as a member of the Republican Party's Team 100, its
elite corps of $100,000 donors.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, serious scandals have erupted involving
lobbyists and fund-raising, but few lobbyists have suffered major
consequences. James H. Lake, a prominent Republican lobbyist, was
convicted for making illegal corporate campaign contributions as
part of the federal criminal probe of Mike Espy, the former
agriculture secretary.
</P>
<P>
   After Lake left the firm where he worked when the illicit
contributions were made, he was offered a position as managing
director of the Washington office of Burson-Marsteller, a public
relations firm. Last January, Lake was fined $150,000, placed on
probation and ordered to write a paper on federal election laws.
Lake's monograph was distributed to the 2,000 members of the
American League of Lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Ms. Eppard, the transportation lobbyist, was indicted
by a federal grand jury in Boston for accepting improper payments
from a lobbyist and a businessman while she was on the House
Transportation Committee chairman's staff. She has denied
wrongdoing and is still actively lobbying, having won provisions
for her clients in the massive highway bill passed this summer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Bipartisan Bazaar &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came to Washington, there was a small coterie of
committee chairmen with iron-clad seniority and tremendous power,''
recalled Charles Walker, a former treasury department official
during the Eisenhower administration who opened the capital's first
non-lawyer lobbying shop in 1973, called Charls Walker Associates.
``On a tax issue, if you had the agreement of the chairman of Ways
and Means, you could go out and play golf'' for the rest of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Walker reflected, ``you can't rest easy unless
you've worked all the members.''
</P>
<P>
   With new committee and subcommittee chairmen, and such a slender
Republican majority, there are many more bases for lobbyists to
cover. The demand for Democrats with ties to the Clinton-Gore
administration and Republicans with connections to GOP lawmakers
has produced a veritable bazaar of political influence, with single
companies and trade associations assembling all-star bipartisan
lobbying teams. On the bankruptcy bill, for example, the American
Financial Services Association showcased in its newsletter its
``team of highly experienced lobbyists and consultants,'' including
two Republican firms, Barbour Griffith &AMP; Rogers and Timmons &AMP; Co.,
as well as Democratic bench strength from Verner, Liipfert,
Bernard, McPherson and Hand, the law firm of former Treasury
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, and Clinton's polling firm, Penn &AMP; Schoen
Associates.
</P>
<P>
   There have been many mergers of Democrats and Republicans in
lobbying firms. In recent weeks there has been speculation that two
respected House members, Vic Fazio, a California Democrat, and Bill
Paxon, a New York Republican, who are both retiring from the House
this year, will join forces and open a new lobbying firm.
</P>
<P>
   Parry &AMP; Romani, a firm that specializes in health and
pharmaceutical lobbying, was long known for its connections to
Orrin Hatch, the Republican Senate Judiciary Committee chairman,
and Dennis DeConcini, a former Democratic Senator from Arizona who
joined the firm when he left the Senate in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of
America and a political veteran who was a top aide to President
Lyndon Johnson, has been Hollywood's man in Washington for 32
years. He said he was nostalgic for the days when he employed a
single lobbying firm, Akin, Gump, which is now one of seven that
the film association keeps on retainer.

 WASHINGTON: on retainer. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Valenti is himself a celebrated Washington insider who earns
more than $1 million. Although he enjoys easy access to most
lawmakers, he said he needed so many other lobbyists because the
film association has an ever-broadening agenda of foreign and
domestic issues before a host of committees and agencies, from the
House Judiciary Committee to the Office of the United States Trade
Representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need any lobbyists for access or entree,'' Valenti
said. ``I need troops in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Field Draws Many &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One of the lobbyists that the movie association has hired is
Vander Jagt, the former Republican House Representative, who said
his services were in much greater demand once the Republicans took
control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Vander Jagt joked that his first years as a
lobbyist after he retired in 1992 were so slow that ``I would have
represented Al Capone or Fidel Castro.'' That all changed after
November 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Vander Jagt can offer the motion picture industry and other
clients a feel for what the Republican leadership is thinking
because he continues to reap the perks of being a former
congressman, attending weekly meetings of several groups that are
open only to current and former Republican lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lobbyist's dream to be sitting there with the committee
chairmen and to find out what's going on,'' said Vander Jagt, who
lobbies on tax and other issues. ``You have all the benefits of
your former life and none of the hardships,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Children, wives and even siblings of lawmakers have hung out
lobbying shingles. One is Linda Hall Daschle, the wife of the
Democratic Senate leader, and a former top official at Federal
Aviation Administration, who lobbies on aviation issues. Another,
Randy DeLay, the brother of House Whip Tom Delay, also has
transportation clients. (An ethics complaint against DeLay that was
sparked by his brother's lobbying activities was dismissed last
year by the House Ethics Committee).
</P>
<P>
   The son of former Sen. J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana is one
of the city's most successful lobbyists. Johnston, former chairman
of the Senate energy committee, joined his son in the business
after he retired in 1996, and so did one of the former senator's
top aides. Their client roster brims with energy interests and they
also lobby for clients on trade issues involving China.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bob Packwood, who was chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, left office after the Ethics Committee decided he should
be expelled because sexual misconduct and accusations that he had
given legislative favors to a lobbyist. During the first half of
this year, Packwood's firm, Sunrise Research Corp., took in
$440,000 lobbying on tax and trade issues for blue-chip clients
like Northwest Airlines and Marriott International.
</P>
<P>
   But even the young and inexperienced are entering the field of
lobbying. Lobbying has become an academic field, with American
University offering a popular course on it.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Lacy, 23, for example, is an alumnus of a two-week
intensive lobbying program at American. From his perch on K Street
at Marlowe &AMP; Co., he enthusiastically sets up client meetings on
Capitol Hill and attends fund-raising events for lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to meet a senator or a congressman and make your
pitch,'' said Lacy, who is earning $25,000 as a beginner.
</P>
<P>
   Lacy, who grew up on the Eastern Shore area of Maryland in a
rural setting where his father is in the agriculture business and
his mother is a public school teacher, said he hoped to keep his
lobbying job while he takes evening law classes.
</P>
<P>
   James Thurber, a professor who runs a lobbying institute at
American, gets well-known lobbyists like Boggs to teach the trade
to fledgling lobbyists like Lacy. Thurber's students are required
to develop a lobbying plan and to make their pitch to a panel of
mock lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want them to feel the pressure of what it's like to be on a
lobbying campaign,'' Thurber said.
</P>
<P>
   Lacy was persuasive in his lobbying assignment to discourage the
mock lawmakers from restricting a computer practice known as
``spamming,'' where businesses send unsolicited e-mail to
consumers. He got an A and a job offer from one of the graders,
Howard Marlowe, himself a lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   Marlowe's clients include property owners and localities trying
to win financing for beach conservation, a cause that Lacy said he
is comfortable embracing. He said some of his friends were working
for tobacco companies, something he said he understood but would
not do.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are making ends meet,'' Lacy said. ``They are learning
the system. They are getting a foot in the door of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Gucci Gulch Ties  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Downey, a New York Democrat, came to Washington in 1974
as the youngest of the Watergate Babies, the reform-minded
newcomers who came to Congress the year of President Nixon's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   No longer a young reformer, Downey, who lost his seat in 1992,
heads a lobbying firm, Downey &AMP; Chandler, that earned more than $2
million last year from clients like the Boeing Co., Microsoft and
Time Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The former New York representative is also the most important
member of Gore's informal ``kitchen cabinet'' of advisers. All of
the members of this group are expected to play pivotal roles in his
presidential campaign in 2000 and many are from the K Street elite.
</P>
<P>
   The group includes top Democratic fund-raisers like Knight and
Dutko and two former domestic policy advisers to Gore, Roy Neel and
Greg Simon, who both lobby for telecommunications interests.
Another member is Jack Quinn, the former White House counsel who
was also Gore's chief of staff. Most of these lobbyists worked for
Gore in the Senate or the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Downey said he keeps his lobbying separate from
his friendship with Gore, with whom he frequently socializes.
</P>
<P>
   And far from feeling like he has sold out his old principles,
Downey said, ``I do more interesting things now than I did as a
member of Congress.'' One thing that is different is how he lives.
When he served in Congress, his family had a cramped Capitol Hill
town house. They now live in a substantial home near the National
Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's coziness with lobbyists is hardly unusual. The Federal
Election Commission has been investigating whether the House whip
John Boehner's weekly get-togethers with business lobbyists
involved unlawful coordination of their political activities,
accusations that Boehner has denied.

 WASHINGTON: has denied. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Rep. Vin Weber is among the most successful of a new crop
of Republican lobbyists. Working as a tag team of political
influence, Weber often pairs up with Downey for clients, including
Microsoft. He works out of the gleaming offices of Clark &AMP;
Wienstock, a Wall Street consulting firm that did not have a
Washington outpost until Weber opened one in 1994, after he retired
from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   As one of Gingrich's best friends in the House, the Minnesota
Republican was in immediate demand. ``People were looking for GOP
consultants and lobbyists all over the place,'' Weber said in an
interview. Weber now heads an eight-man office that reported
lobbying revenues of $2.2 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Like Downey, Weber is still an inside player, jetting off
earlier this year to join Gingrich at a Republican event in Palm
Springs, Calif. And he, too, finds his new profession more
rewarding in many ways. ``With no disrespect to Congress,'' Weber
said, ``not everything you do as a congressman is very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Weber and Downey also have the luxury of turning down clients.
Both men refused to work for the tobacco industry and Weber said he
would not be comfortable registering as a foreign agent to lobby
for a foreign client.
</P>
<P>
   Another former Republican lawmaker in demand is Bob Dole. The
former senate majority leader and 1996 Republican presidential
candidate is now ``of counsel'' at the Washington law firm of
Verner, Liipfert, where he said he does not lobby but provides
strategic advice to clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any interest in going up there with my hat in my
hand,'' he said. ``We have people in the law firm who do that. I'm
part of that conversation but it didn't feel comfortable as the
former leader.''
</P>
<P>
   But his former political prominence still lands him national
platforms, like an appearance on David Letterman's show earlier
this summer. There, between jokes, he took a moment to criticize
Clinton for his stance toward Taiwan. He did not disclose that his
firm represents Taiwan, a relationship that required him to
register as a foreign agent.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he should have, Dole said that he had been a supporter
of Taiwan for years before he joined Verner, Liipfert.
</P>
<P>
   Dole's firm, loaded with political superstars like former Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell and former Gov. Ann Richards of
Texas, earned $19 million in lobbying fees last year, the most
reported by any firm. Its partners also contribute generously to
federal candidates and the political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, whose anti-tobacco and campaign finance
overhaul bills went down to defeat amid a hail storm of lobbying,
said Washington would continue to be dominated by monied interests
as long as lobbyists remained at the hub of campaign fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lobbyists give out the soft money,'' said the Arizona
Republican, whose campaign finance bill would ban soft money
contributions. ``If you take away the soft money, you do really
reduce the influence of these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader, who has watched the growth of corporate influence
in the capital in his 30 years as a consumer advocate, agreed, but
said Senator McCain did not go far enough. Nader favors public
financing of federal elections as well as new mechanisms for
building genuine citizens' lobbies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to reform lobbying is like trying to stop a leak,'' he
said. ``You block the water here, and it just goes around the
corner.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``I haven't thought about Monica Lewinsky all
day,'' mused Wright Andrews, a Washington lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   He has been too busy. While the rest of Washington has been
obsessing over the president's sex scandal, Andrews and dozens of
other business lobbyists were working on bankruptcy legislation
that passed the Senate on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr's $40 million investigation may have dominated the
headlines and caused misery for President Clinton, but the $40
million already spent on lobbying by the credit card, banking and
retailing industries could affect millions of consumers by making
it much tougher to declare personal bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   This year has also, separately, been a banner year for K Street,
the power corridor of law and lobbying firms in downtown
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with massive lobbying earlier in the year by the
cigarette industry to crush a comprehensive tobacco bill, followed
by the lobbying to influence major banking and bankruptcy
legislation and the lobbying yet to come on appropriations, trade
and tax measures, Wright and many lobbyists interviewed in recent
months predict more will be spent on influencing the federal
government this year than the record $1.2 billion that was
reportedly spent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The influence industry had already been on a growth curve in the
1980s, but it has exploded in recent years with the advent of a
divided government. A new cast of Republican congressional
committee and subcommittee chairmen, as well as Washington's
increasing impact on highly regulated industries like financial
services, telecommunications and health care, has meant that
corporations and lobbying companies are reaching much deeper into
the bureaucracy in order to wield influence.
</P>
<P>
   When Kenneth Kies left his congressional staff position last
winter for a million-dollar offer to lobby for
PricewaterhouseCoopers, congressional committee chairmen, senior
Treasury Department and White House officials and lobbyists all
turned out for a lavish farewell fete for Kies in the House Ways
and Means Committee room, a testament to his connectedness.
</P>
<P>
   The eye-popping salary package for Kies, a 46-year-old
Republican tax lawyer who earned $132,000 as chief of staff of the
Joint Committee on Taxation, was fresh evidence of a culture of
money that in the 1990s has begun to transform Washington's old
image as a power city.
</P>
<P>
   Boutique firms that specialize in lobbying a single member or a
single committee of Congress have also sprouted up and are
flourishing. Ann Eppard, who for 22 years served as a top aide to
Bud Shuster, the House Transportation Committee chairman, is one
who left her job in 1994 and hung out her shingle as a
transportation lobbyist. Within months, she had lined up more than
$1 million in retainers from an array of big transportation
companies, including the FDX Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Some denizens of the capital believe that K Street's explosion
has fundamentally changed the atmosphere, a new obsession with
money eclipsing Washington's traditional obsession with power.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York was money, Los Angeles was glamour and Washington was
always power,'' Victor Kamber, a lobbyist and a political
consultant for 32 years whose firm billed $11 million last year.
``Now this town is as much about money as power.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington has long been one of the nation's wealthiest
metropolitan areas, with a large population of government workers
and white collar professionals. But its elite, led by a stratum of
highly paid lawyers and lobbyists, has never been as brazen in
advertising its money or political connections.
</P>
<P>
   At the Capital Grille, an expensive restaurant that opened near
the Capitol in 1994, lobbyists flaunt their clients and their
expensive tastes with brass name plaques on private wine lockers.
So many wealthy Washingtonians have begun buying second homes along
Maryland's once-quaint Eastern Shore that some areas are taking on
the congested feeling on summer weekends of the Hamptons on Long
Island. And a new glossy magazine, Capital Style, regularly
profiles the lives of Washington's rich and famous.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing seems to restrain this new culture. Not tighter
revolving door rules signed by Clinton that lengthened the time
that some lobbyists must refrain from lobbying their old agencies.
Not a gift ban passed by the Congress to loosen the knot of
friendship between lobbyists and lawmakers. Not even a major
fund-raising scandal in which some of the city's premier lobbyists,
including Haley Barbour, a former Republican Party chairman, and
Peter Knight, a Democratic fund-raiser, were brought before
congressional committees.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most expensive lobbying campaigns have been aimed at
making sure nothing happens, like the $100 million spent to kill
anti-tobacco legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the best lobbyists are like paid assassins,'' said
Jennifer Shecter of the Center for Responsive Politics, a research
group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists have always been part of the capital's political
fabric, but have never before been so intimately interwoven into
the government. Twenty years ago, for example, most Washington law
firms did little or no lobbying. Now virtually all of them have
bustling lobbying practices, and some firms have even hired
non-lawyers to increase their political clout.
</P>
<P>
   In his fight against impeachment, Clinton has reached out to a
network of Democratic lobbyists, lawyers and political consultants,
including Thomas Hale Boggs Jr., Jody Powell, Joseph O'Neill and
Anthony Podesta, who participate in a daily conference call with
the White House to plot strategy. This daily bull session is
organized by Steve Ricchetti, who recently returned to the White
House after leaving to become a lobbyist. Both Vice President Al
Gore and House Speaker Newt Gingrich have tight coteries of
lobbyists who regularly advise them on political matters.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Phillips, the political analyst who wrote ``Arrogant
Capital,'' worried that Washington had become what the Founding
Fathers feared, a ``capital so privileged and incestuous in its
dealings, that average citizens believe it is no longer accessible
to the general public.'' Phillips added that there was nothing like
Washington's ``massive, permanent lobbying elite'' in other foreign
capitals.
</P>
<P>
   Even Robert Strauss, at age 80 perhaps the most seasoned member
of a generation of Democratic superlawyers, is amazed at how fast
the revolving door spins. A former Democratic Party chairman and
U.S. trade representative, Strauss said in a recent interview that
lawyers now often go to work for the government for a few years,
not because they want a career in public service, but because
``they know that enables them to move on out in a few years and
become associated with a lobbying or law firm and their services
are in tremendous demand.''

BOSTON RESTAURANTS GOING SMOKELESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANTHONY FLINT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Get ready to snuff out that last butt, Boston.
</P>
<P>
   After months of talk, the restaurant smoking ban starts at
midnight Tuesday. And nothing will stop it now.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, a superior court judge threw out a request for an
injunction by restaurant owners, the last potential obstacle for
Boston to begin its smoke-free experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller cities and towns in Massachusetts have implemented
smoking bans. But Boston is one of the few major cities in the
country to implement a smoking ban, joining New York City and
California, which has a statewide ban.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Thomas M. Menino said he wants to continue to work with
restaurant owners to comply with the ban and won't take a hard line
in the first few days, in terms of enforcement. But the mayor
remains confident diners will be grateful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in the business of closing down establishments.
We're in the business of having a clean atmosphere for people to
dine in,'' he said. ``Starting tomorrow, the new item on menus in
the city will be clean air.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the ban, smoking is prohibited in all establishments that
serve food only, from mom-and-pop coffee shops to fast-food
outlets. Smoking is also prohibited in the dining sections of
restaurants that also have bars; smoking in the bar is allowed if
the bar section is not more than one-third the total seating
capacity, and if the section is separated from non-smoking areas by
a six-foot buffer zone or a floor-to-ceiling barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking will still be allowed in bars and taverns, even those
that serve food. And steakhouse-goers can still light up a cigar,
as long as it's in a private function room.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Mitchell J. Sikora Jr. denied a request by the
Massachusetts Restaurant Association to delay the implementation of
the ban. The association had argued that the ban would put many
establishments out of business, and that it had so many exceptions
and loopholes it was not a reasonable measure to protect public
health.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant association, which has ties with the tobacco
industry, argued in part that the exceptions to the ban _ allowing
smoking in bar areas, for example _ defeated the city's goal to
protect all people from second-hand smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Sikora said the association's legal arguments were not strong
enough to warrant an injunction, though the restaurant association
still has a lawsuit against the city pending.
</P>
<P>
   John Auerbach, executive director of the city's Public Health
Commission, which is enforcing the ban, has acknowledged that the
ban is limited, since someone smoking a cigarette at a bar could
easily blow smoke into the air over a dining table just six feet
away. But Auerbach said the goal of the ban was simply to ``lower
the amount of secondhand smoke ... in the places where people are
eating.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last several months, representatives from the Public
Health Commission have attempted to visit every one of the
2,000-plus dining establishments in the city, spelling out the new
requirements. Officials say in most cases no new construction is
needed to accomodate the ban, since many bar sections are already
separated from dining areas by more than six feet.
</P>
<P>
   Some problems arise if the path to the restroom is located next
to a bar section, since the ban says patrons must also be able to
go to the bathroom or sit in a waiting area without being exposed
to smoke. But restaurant managers must simply make sure there is a
smoke-free path created, however that can be done, enforcement
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Managers of some bistros or cafes with only a small bar section
that is close to dining tables have found the easiest option is to
go 100 percent smoke-free. But the ban is also sufficiently
flexible that many establishments also have the option of calling
themselves a bar that serves food, to keep smoking throughout.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Health Commission says more than 1,400 establishments
in Boston will be entirely smoke-free starting at midnight; an
additional 200 restaurants with bar areas are expected to allow
smoking only in the bar sections.

WASHINGTON: tremendous demand. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been nearly 15 years since Michael Deaver, a former
Reagan White House aide turned lobbyist, sparked a firestorm by
posing for an infamous Time Magazine cover article that showed him
flaunting his multimillion-dollar accounts and pictured him riding
in a limousine. But earlier this year, Washingtonian Magazine, a
glossy journal that caters to the city's professional elite, had no
trouble rounding up many of the city's 50 top lobbyists to pose for
a group photo accompanying an article titled, ``Show Me the
Money!'' Though he was not in the picture, Deaver is still a
successful lobbyist at one of the city's premier public relations
firms.
</P>
<P>
   The nexus of lobbying and campaign fund-raising, which lawmakers
and lobbyists used to make efforts to conceal, has also never been
more graphically displayed. It is no coincidence that some of
Washington's most successful lobbyists, like Barbour and Daniel
Dutko, a close adviser to Vice President Al Gore, are also leading
fund-raisers for their respective parties.
</P>
<P>
   Half of all political action committee contributions to federal
candidates and parties, meanwhile, flow from Washington, with many
donors listing zip codes in the K Street corridor. Two dozen
lobbyists interviewed said they received hundreds of fund-raising
solicitations from congressmen and their parties last year, some
closely timed after a lobbying meeting with a particular lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can almost count on getting some kind of fund-raising
solicitation after you've been to the Hill,'' said one lobbyist who
insisted he not be named. ``The time in between has gotten shorter
and shorter and it's gotten more and more brazen.''
</P>
<P>
   When Andrews, the business lobbyist, recently signed up a trade
association of home equity lenders as a client, one of the first
pieces of advice he gave the association was to establish a
political action committee. ``Under the current system, campaign
giving and fund-raising are essential,'' he said. ``When it isn't
done, it's noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporate interests who finance the largest portion of
Washington's lobbying are fortifying their influence with record
campaign contributions to federal lawmakers. Even as the House
moved to ban large contributions to the political parties, known as
soft money, the national political parties scooped up $115 million
in these big donations from business and other interests over the
last 18 months, more than double the amount raised during a
comparable period in the last non-presidential election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp., which only opened a Washington office only
three years ago but now has one of the largest fleets of lobbyists
_ more than a dozen people and firms _ recently signed on through
one of its executives as a member of the Republican Party's Team
100, its elite corps of $100,000 donors.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, serious scandals have erupted involving
lobbyists and fund-raising, but few lobbyists have suffered major
consequences. James H. Lake, a prominent Republican lobbyist, was
convicted for making illegal corporate campaign contributions as
part of the federal criminal probe of Mike Espy, the former
agriculture secretary.
</P>
<P>
   After Lake left the firm where he worked when the illicit
contributions were made, he was offered a position as managing
director of the Washington office of Burson-Marsteller, a public
relations firm. Last January, Lake was fined $150,000, placed on
probation and ordered to write a paper on federal election laws.
Lake's monograph was distributed to the 2,000 members of the
American League of Lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Ms. Eppard, the transportation lobbyist, was indicted
by a federal grand jury in Boston for accepting improper payments
from a lobbyist and a businessman while she was on the House
Transportation Committee chairman's staff. She has denied
wrongdoing and is still actively lobbying, having won provisions
for her clients in the massive highway bill passed this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Children, wives and even siblings of lawmakers have hung out
lobbying shingles. One is Linda Hall Daschle, the wife of the
Democratic Senate leader, and a former top official at Federal
Aviation Administration, who lobbies on aviation issues. Another,
Randy DeLay, the brother of House Whip Tom Delay, also has
transportation clients. (An ethics complaint against DeLay that was
sparked by his brother's lobbying activities was dismissed last
year by the House Ethics Committee).
</P>
<P>
   The son of former Sen. J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana is one
of the city's most successful lobbyists. Johnston, former chairman
of the Senate energy committee, joined his son in the business
after he retired in 1996, and so did one of the former senator's
top aides. Their client roster brims with energy interests and they
also lobby for clients on trade issues involving China.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bob Packwood, who was chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, left office after the Ethics Committee decided he should
be expelled because sexual misconduct and accusations that he had
given legislative favors to a lobbyist. During the first half of
this year, Packwood's firm, Sunrise Research Corp., took in
$440,000 lobbying on tax and trade issues for blue-chip clients
like Northwest Airlines and Marriott International.
</P>
<P>
   But even the young and inexperienced are entering the field of
lobbying. Lobbying has become an academic field, with American
University offering a popular course on it.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, whose anti-tobacco and campaign finance
overhaul bills went down to defeat amid a hail storm of lobbying,
said Washington would continue to be dominated by monied interests
as long as lobbyists remained at the hub of campaign fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lobbyists give out the soft money,'' said the Arizona
Republican, whose campaign finance bill would ban soft money
contributions. ``If you take away the soft money, you do really
reduce the influence of these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader, who has watched the growth of corporate influence
in the capital in his 30 years as a consumer advocate, agreed, but
said Senator McCain did not go far enough. Nader favors public
financing of federal elections as well as new mechanisms for
building genuine citizens' lobbies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to reform lobbying is like trying to stop a leak,'' he
said. ``You block the water here, and it just goes around the
corner.''

HARGROVE BRINGS ZEAL FOR PERFECTION TO MANAGING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's never been easy for Mike Hargrove. As a player for the
Cleveland Indians, he sought perfection to a fault. As a manager,
he is just as demanding, because he understands what it means to be
on the outside looking in.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove has come a long way since he arrived on the shores of
Lake Erie in 1979. Many only think of him as the Human Rain Delay,
a meticulous hitter who made preparation in the batter's box a work
of art. Truth is he was an outstanding hitter who finished with a
.290 career average.
</P>
<P>
   He's had the same kind of success at the Cleveland helm, where
he has presided since 1991. Under Hargrove, the Indians have risen
from being the laughingstock of the American League East to one of
the premier franchises in major league baseball. Hargrove picked up
his 600th victory as a manager Aug. 8 as Cleveland led the Central
from the outset.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove has led the Indians to four straight division titles
and two World Series appearances. The Indians won 100 games in 1995
but lost to Atlanta in the Series. In 1996, they won 99 games and
were eliminated in the playoffs. Last year, they won the AL pennant
only to lose in the Series to the expansion Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   While none too happy that his team has twice been denied the
championship, Hargrove is pleased that his club has performed well
enough to earn another shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, we'd liked to return,'' he says. ``And it's not
just a desire to win the thing because we lost last year. Our goal
has always been to win the World Series. First, you get to the
postseason, and then you take your chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a player, I spent 12 years in the big leagues and never got
to the postseason. Thus, I never came to understand what it all
takes to get there. I hear the complaints about us playing in a
weak division. But I'm sure people who have never done it don't
understand how extremely difficult it is to win. We had some
intermediate goals along the way that we have reached. Now the next
goal is to win the Series. Whether that happens or not, I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows if the Indians are good enough to reach the Series.
They had the AL Central wrapped up early with little opposition
from Chicago, Kansas City, Minnesota, and Detroit. But they
struggled in September, losing six of the last seven games. Critics
insist that they may be only the third- or fourth-best team in the
American League and may be in cruise control. The next week or two
will test that theory. The Yankees won an AL-record 114 games. The
Red Sox (92-72) won eight of 11 from the Indians. The red-hot Texas
Rangers are better than their 88-74 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the best team some of those other years,'' said
Hargrove. ``I think everybody will tell you the Yankees are (this
year). We've had some problems, but we're still a very good ball
club.''
</P>
<P>
   In his early years, Cleveland management wouldn't go out and buy
Hargrove a pennant. But they did the next best thing, which was to
begin signing young stars Kenny Lofton, Carlos Baerga, Albert
Belle, Sandy Alomar, Jim Thome, and Omar Vizquel to long-term
contracts. When Cleveland won 100 games in 1995, nobody was
surprised, least of all Hargrove. Baerga and Belle were later
traded. Lofton, too, but he has returned. The Indians play to
packed houses and virtual sellouts every game at Jacobs Field. A
far cry from the dismal days at Cleveland Municipal Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a lot of highs along the way,'' he said. ``I'd
say reaching the World Series for the first time in 41 years was
the biggest one for me. We had a very good ball club that year.
Fact is that our talent has been here since 1992. We slowly pieced
things together and began to contend in 1994.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Indians have been able to add free agent talent, when
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're an attractive club,'' says Hargrove, ``and knowing we
can keep (players) longer than what might be called normal makes a
huge difference in what we can do with our ball club. The free
agents look at our ball club and see a situation where there is
stability.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hargrove is quick to point out that Cleveland's stability
hasn't prevented problems. The club freely acknowledges the exits
of Baerga and Belle were ugly affairs _ the former losing the
confidence of the fans, the latter losing the backing of the
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove applauds general manager John Hart, who has mixed and
matched free agents, signing the likes of Dennis Martinez, Orel
Hershiser, and Matt Williams, and letting them go in favor of
home-grown talent such as Jaret Wright and Bartolo Colon, who have
become front-line pitchers. Belle's numbers were matched by Manny
Ramirez, who exploded this season with 45 home runs and 145 RBIs.
He was particularly valuable with Jim Thome out of the lineup for
more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say how valuable he has been to us,'' Hargrove said.
``He's made such progress as a hitter and has improved on defense.
I personally think he has to be given considerable MVP
consideration, along with Juan Gonzalez and Nomar Garciaparra.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of the hottest, fastest-growing managed health care plans
are turning out to be the ones that are hardly managed at all.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike health maintenance organizations, which typically try to
keep tight control over their members by requiring them to funnel
all requests for specialized care through a single doctor, the
minimal health plans try to keep costs in check mostly by
persuading doctors and hospitals to agree to reduced fees.
</P>
<P>
   The loosely managed plans, called preferred provider
organizations, or PPOs, are not new, but their popularity is
surging _ taking customers not only from the traditional unlimited
fee-for-service plans but also luring people from more restrictive
HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   The members of PPOs can go to any doctor without asking
permission, although it costs them more to go to physicians and
hospitals outside the organization's network.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs _ managed care plans that depend on elaborate sets of rules
to govern their payments _ also usually negotiate discounted fees
by hospitals and specialist physicians. But in most plans members
must use the network physicians for primary care and, to see a
specialist, must get approval from a primary doctor called a
gatekeeper. Some HMOs are even more restrictive, relying on staff
physicians to provide primary and specialized care at in-house
clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are demanding wide choice, and health plans are
scrambling to offer it,'' said Dr. William Roper, a former managed
care executive who is dean of the School of Public Health of the
University of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   There is the risk, though, that what consumers want will
eventually send overall health care costs soaring again. As more
people reject the restrictive HMOs for the relative freedom of
preferred provider plans, questions arise as to whether quality
health care can be delivered at reasonable cost. Meanwhile, some
HMOs that have tried to compete by being more flexible have run
into serious financial trouble.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of all the changes is the fading of the gatekeeper
concept _ which was supposed not just to control costs but also to
improve care by having one person, the primary doctor, generally in
charge of a member's entire treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some say that the HMO gatekeepers themselves are
increasingly liberal about allowing tests and visits to specialists
and thus have become an expensive layer in the networks'
administrative costs. With hospital and physician costs starting to
rise after several years of flat costs or only tiny increases, some
skeptics even question whether the gatekeepers and other management
techniques of HMOs really deserve credit for keeping inflation in
check.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if, when all the smoke about savings clears, all the
savings were accomplished by means of the discounts?'' asked John
Erb, a consultant in Boca Raton, Fla., with Arthur Gallagher &AMP; Co.
``Those 25 percent to 30 percent discounts from hospitals and
physicians may be the source of the savings that we've seen over
the last five years.''
</P>
<P>
   The PPO surge in popularity _ nationally, the provider plans now
have 40 percent more members than HMOs _ has won new respect for
the networks. ``Five years ago, people viewed preferred provider
organizations as a dying breed, a transition'' to HMOs, Roper said.
``Now we are seeing a resurgence in interest in more loose
arrangements.''
</P>
<P>
   Health maintenance organizations are also gaining members, but
much more slowly than the provider organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, preferred provider organizations have 105 million
members and HMOs have 75 million, said Karen Ignagni, president of
the American Association of Health Plans, a managed care trade
group. In the last five years, PPOs added 44 million members, while
HMOs added 30 million.
</P>
<P>
   One national survey of large employers, conducted by the KPMG
Peat Marwick consulting firm, found this year that the proportion
of employees in HMOs has dropped three percentage points from its
peak, to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even in California, a bastion of managed care, the big Wellpoint
Health Networks says its provider organizations have been growing
twice as fast as its health maintenance organizations. The insurer,
one of the largest in the nation, says its provider organizations
added 850,000 members last year for a total of 4 million. Its HMOs
have 1.6 million members, up 300,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans don't want to be told what to do,'' said Leonard
Schaeffer, chairman of Wellpoint. ``They want choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a monthly premium that is often subsidized by an
employer, in a preferred provider network a member pays $5, $10 or
$15 for an office visit to a doctor in the network. For doctors
outside the network and some medical services, the costs are like
those in traditional insurance _ after an annual deductible of a
few hundred dollars, the member pays 20 percent of the charges.
</P>
<P>
   A backlash led by disgruntled doctors and patients has pushed
many tightly structured HMO plans to relax their rules, blurring
the line between HMOs and preferred provider plans.
</P>
<P>
   These flexible HMOs, known as point-of-service plans, which
permit members to go outside if they get permission from their HMO
primary doctors, are also growing but seem to be losing momentum,
especially in the East.
</P>
<P>
   Small companies say the preferred provider plans help them to
recruit and retain employees. ``We employ kids out of college who
don't know doctors and can consult the network,'' said Steve
Kantor, president of Gnossos Software in Washington, D.C., which
has 25 employees.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of health maintenance organizations also allow
members to consult specialists on their lists without first getting
permission from a primary care doctor, or gatekeeper. Others, like
Oxford Health Plans Inc., let members consult outside specialists
who are not on the HMO list, but members usually need advance
approval from a gatekeeper doctor.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Big health insurers like United Healthcare Corp. have moved
millions of members from traditional fee-for-service plans, which
typically pay full rates, to preferred provider plans. One in four
of the 69.9 million members of Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans now
have this type of coverage, compared with only one in 10 a decade
ago.
</P>
<P>
   A number of the point-of-service HMOs, notably Oxford Health
Plans, have reported financial troubles that analysts say were
brought on by difficulty in keeping track of costs when members go
to doctors outside the plans' lists.
</P>
<P>
   The outside doctors in these HMOs typically have little reason
to hold back on consultations and tests, so costs may rise.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, administrative costs in health maintenance
organizations can be twice as high as in provider networks, where
patients make their own decisions without gatekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Whether HMOs are ``worth the hassle and the administrative cost
is coming into question,'' said Liz Rossman, vice president for
benefits at Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. Although most of the 300,000
employees and their dependents that Sears covers are still in
classic HMOs, the company plans to switch 40,000 from
point-of-service HMOs and traditional fee-for-service plans to a
preferred provider network on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The provider plans are cheaper for employers, said Charles
Wolcott, a vice president of Sony Music Entertainment, and
``probably will have the same results in the delivery of care.''
Consulting a gatekeeper just adds one more layer of doctor bills,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some HMOs have gotten unbelievably expensive'' for employers,
Ms. Rossman said. ``The country is seeing for the first time
actually sick people and older people in HMOs, and we are not
seeing evidence of HMOs doing a particularly good job of managing
care either.''
</P>
<P>
   On average around the country, preferred provider premiums for
single employees are $175 a month this year, according to KPMG Peat
Marwick. Point-of-service HMOs averaged $176, and the standard
HMOs, $160.
</P>
<P>
   But costs vary from city to city. ``In some locations, preferred
provider organizations will actually be less than some HMOs,'' Ms.
Rossman said.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Krueger, a benefits executive at Circuit City Stores, said
a point-of-service plan that now covers 19,000 workers at the
retail chain had not been effective in ``getting people to the
best-qualified provider and making sure they get the care they
need.''
</P>
<P>
   Circuit City, based in Richmond, is replacing the
point-of-service plan with a preferred provider network organized
by Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Empire, which has 800,000 members in the provider organizations,
is ending its point-of-service plans for all but its biggest
customers, said Dr. Michael Stocker, president of the big New
York-based insurer. Most are switching to preferred provider
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Marshall, a race track clerk for the New York Racing
Association, said he tries to stay in his preferred provider
network. When he broke a bone recently, he went to an emergency
room in the network and paid only $35. ``I had no problem with the
coverage whatsoever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts worry, though, that the benefits of HMO care will
be lost in the shuffle. Suzanne Mercure, an independent consultant
in Falls Church, Va., said HMOs were more likely than networks of
doctors to keep track of patients and collect information to help
them deal with chronic problems like asthma and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, it will probably mostly come down to price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any consumer would probably prefer a PPO,'' said William
Sullivan, president of Oxford Health Plans. ``But they are more
expensive than HMOs. Members go ping-ponging around from specialist
to specialist,'' adding to costs.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford, which has one of the nation's biggest point-of-service
HMOs, has been battered by big increases in medical costs. But
Sullivan thinks the popularity of the preferred provider
organizations will be dimmed as higher costs are passed along as
higher premiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upper-middle-class people will be willing to pay more for the
choice,'' said Jon Gabel, director of surveys at Peat Marwick.
Health maintenance organizations will remain popular with people
who are ``more price sensitive,'' he said.

EARLIER CALIFORNIA PRIMARY UPSETS NEW ENGLAND STATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To the dismay of Massachusetts officials,
California Governor Pete Wilson signed legislation Monday to move
up his state's primary to the same date as the ``Yankee Day''
presidential vote, which could vastly reduce New England's impact
in the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a national disaster,'' Massachusetts Secretary of
State William Galvin said, asserting that California's move would
drastically compress the national primary schedule and ``certainly
diminish the influence of Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wilson, ignoring pleas from states that already plan to hold
a presidential primary on March 7, 2000, said California has been
ignored for too long and can only make its voice heard by moving up
the vote. Shortly after Wilson signed the bill Monday, his press
secretary, Sean Walsh, said, ``The sound you hear is the 800-pound
gorilla waking up. This could change the face of politics as we
know it.
</P>
<P>
   California's population is more than twice that of all the New
England states combined, meaning presidential candidates will spend
more of their time and money campaigning there than in New England,
where all states but New Hampshire vote in the Yankee Day primary.
California elects about one-fifth of all delegates who attend the
two parties' nominating conventions.
</P>
<P>
   The Californias change does not affect the first-in-the-nation
New Hampshire primary. State law requires that its vote be held 10
days before any other primary and some New Hampshire officials have
said California's move makes the early Granite State vote more
important than ever.
</P>
<P>
   But New Hampshire Secretary of State William Gardner was not as
optimistic Monday, saying California's action was ``bad for the
process. ... If it's not good for the country, it's not good for
New Hampshire.'' Gardner said the chance for a lesser known
candidate such as Bill Clinton or Jimmy Carter to succeed through
direct voter contact will be cut, with candidates forced to jump
from one tarmac to another while spending millions of dollars on
television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the handwringing in New England, there was agreement that
California's move would have a major impact on the nomination
process. California will join nine other states that tentatively
plan to hold the primaries on March 7, which by some estimates
could result in a one-day selection of about half the delegates
needed for the nomination. Primaries are currently scheduled on
March 7, 2000, in these states: California, Massachusetts, Vermont,
Rhode Island, Connecticut, Maine, Georgia, New York, Maryland and
Colorado. There is also a possibility that Washington and Oregon
might join the list, while some states now scheduled for March 7
may switch to later dates. Galvin said it is unlikely that a state
could opt for an earlier date because of various party rules.
</P>
<P>
   The March 7 lineup includes of states has special appeal for a
centrist Republican. That has raised suspicions that the change in
California was engineered by the moderate Wilson for his own
benefit, if he runs for the presidency in 2000. The calendar has
tended recently to benefit more conservative Republicans because
many Southern states vote in the Super Tuesday primary.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, the beneficiaries would be the
best-known and best-financed candidates who can afford the enormous
expense of advertising in California, which is why Galvin and some
others suspect the move was designed by Democrats who back the
expected candidacy of Vice President Al Gore. Gore's aides have
said the vice president had nothing to do with the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``California is such a big money state that it will make it
harder for more marginal players to compete effectively,'' said
Merle Black, professor of politics at Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, through spokesman Walsh, said that the ``the move should
be welcomed in New England.''
</P>
<P>
   ``California and the New England states have a similar cultural
diversity,'' Walsh said. ``This should somewhat change the
political strategy of running hard to the right and then tacking
back to the center after the first round of presidential
primaries.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been questions raised about whether California's new
primary could run into legal problems if the state's voters fail to
approve a November referendum measure that would change the way the
state's delegates are selected to conform with party rules. The
referendum asks voters to approve a ``closed'' primary system, in
which members of one party cannot cross lines and vote for a
candidate in another party. Without such a change, the national
parties may not recognize the results of the California primary.
</P>
<P>
   But even if voters do not approve the measure, California could
still hold a March 7 primary in what is known as a ``beauty
contest,'' with a caucus held later to pick the delegates.
California state Senator James Costa, the author of the primary
legislation, said the vote will be held on March 7 regardless of
what happens with the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary is now on the first Tuesday in March, and unless
there is a change by whoever is the next governor, it will remain
the first Tuesday in March,'' said Costa, adding that the day may
be a ``de facto national primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Galvin said he would try to get the national parties to force
California to delay its primary. At the very least, Galvin wants
the parties to create a system of rotating regional primaries.
</P>
<P>
   California Secretary of State William Jones said Monday in a
statement that he endorsed the general idea of rotating regional
primaries. Under such a system, Iowa and New Hampshire would still
go first, followed by four or five regional primary days. The
regions would rotate the order in which they hold their primaries
every four years.
</P>
<P>
   But it might take approval of all 50 states to set up such a
radical change in the primary system, and many states so far have
been unwilling to accept the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``To reform this process, all 50 states must work together to
develop a system of regional primaries that rotates every four
years to allow each state's voters to have a say in the selection
of presidential nominees,'' Jones said. But in 2000, Jones said,
California will have the earlier primary that the rules allow.

STOCK PRICES ARE MIXED WHILE TRADERS AWAIT FED DECISION ON INTEREST
RATES
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices were mixed on Monday, as traders and
investors awaited an announcement, expected on Tuesday afternoon,
that the Federal Reserve policy makers have decided to lower
short-term interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The gains recorded during the session were confined to blue-chip
and large-capitalization stocks. Broader market measures were
weaker.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 80.07, or 1 percent, to
8,108.84, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index closed at
1,048.69, up 3.94.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nasdaq composite index fell 4.37, to 1,739.22. The
Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.01, to 368.01.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is running into a level of resistance at between
8,100 and 8,300 on the Dow,'' said one trader, who asked not to be
identified. ``Even if the Fed cuts rates, there are still worries
about Brazil, still worries about more fall-out from Long-Term
Capital'' Management, the troubled hedge fund that is receiving a
$3.65 billion bailout.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipation of an interest rate cut has been building for
weeks. But confidence that the Fed will move quickly to protect the
economy from the effects of financial turmoil overseas reached a
higher level late last week, following congressional testimony by
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``The language Mr. Greenspan used was very forthright,'' Jeffrey
Applegate, the chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers,
said. ``Right now people are marking time, debating if the Fed will
cut rates by one-quarter of a percentage point, or by one-half a
point.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal funds rate, which is used by commercial banks as a
benchmark to determine the interest charges paid by millions of
consumers and businesses on short-term debt, has been 5.5 percent
since March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Applegate and others said that a quarter-point cut in the
federal funds rate was already built into stock market prices. They
agreed that failure by the Fed to cut rates by at least that much
would get a harsh market reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Fed doesn't move it would be a material negative,''
said Michael Molnar, a managing director in retail sales and
trading at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   But Molnar and others said a more dramatic move, such as a
half-point cut, might be overly aggressive, and send the wrong
signal.
</P>
<P>
   Expectation of interest rate relief is not confined to the
United States. Latin markets, which would benefit from a cut in
American interest rates, posted gains on Monday. And price gains
were widespread on European and Asian equity markets.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about the stability of the financial system were
heightened last week after a group of the world's most powerful
commercial and investment banks agreed to prevent Long-Term Capital
Management L.P. from failing by pumping $3.65 billion into the
hedge fund.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors persisted on Monday that another hedge fund was on the
brink of bankruptcy, and that talk hurt a number of brokerage
stocks. Lehman Brothers fell 3[, to 30[, and Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter dropped by 3], to 49\.
</P>
<P>
   Big consumer stocks, which have been pummeled over concerns
about the effect slumping Asian economies will have on earnings,
did better. Procter &AMP; Gamble rose 3[, to 73|. Gillette, which
announced after the market closed that it would lay off 11 percent
of its work force, rose 1 11/16, to 40. Colgate-Palmolive jumped 3
3/16, to 72|. Coca-Cola, which told analysts last week that
earnings were slowing, rose 1 1/16, to 57\.

ANNE FRANK BIOGRAPHY: WHEN A SPIRITED TEEN-AGER FACED THE
UNIMAGINABLE
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Anne Frank's biographer, Melissa Muller, observes, ``The
Diary of a Young Girl'' is arguably the most widely read document
ever written about Nazi crimes, and it turned its young author into
``a universal symbol of the oppressed in a world of violence and
tyranny.'' Her name, Ms. Muller writes, ``invokes humanity,
tolerance, human rights and democracy; her image is the epitome of
optimism and the will to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne's diary, however, gave us not a symbol but an individual:
In charting what the poet John Berryman once called the mysterious
``conversion of a child into a person,'' it gave us an indelible
portrait of a teen-ager on the cusp of adulthood _ a spirited,
willful girl with an impish smile and a bright laugh, a young woman
trying to come to terms with her family, her literary ambitions and
her dreams of meeting her Prince Charming in the shadow of ``the
approaching thunder'' of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   So direct and honest are Anne Frank's words that readers of her
diary somehow feel they know all there is to know about her. We've
read about her enduring devotion to her father, Otto; her
contentious relationship with her mother, Edith; her competitive
feelings toward her sister, Margot. We feel we know what life was
like in the ``secret annex,'' the cramped attic rooms that the
Franks shared with another family as they hid out from the Nazis
for 25 months. And we feel we understand Anne's longing for her
former life, her efforts to grapple with questions of religion and
faith, and her terror, boredom and loneliness as she and her family
tried to wait out the war.
</P>
<P>
   So, one might ask, what remains to be said about Anne Frank?
Quite a bit, as it turns out. For one thing, Ms. Muller, an
Austrian journalist, has brought to light five missing pages from
the published diary (withheld for decades by her father), which
suggest that Anne wanted her diary to remain private. They also
suggest that Anne saw her parents' marriage as a marriage of
convenience, and believed that this painful situation was the
reason for her mother's coldness and detachment. In suppressing
these pages, Ms. Muller argues, Otto Frank ``did both Edith and
Anne a disservice, for this entry is not only a portrait of a
problematic marriage but also a record of Anne's growing sympathy
for her mother.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to revealing the contents of the missing diary pages
_ which Ms. Muller was only able to paraphrase because the Anne
Frank Fonds (Foundation), which controlled the copyright, denied
her permission to quote directly _ this biography also acts as a
supplement to the diary, filling in Anne's fragmentary view of her
own life. It depicts Anne Frank as she was seen by her relatives
and friends, both as a child innocent of history and as a young
woman initiated into the tragedies of World War II. At the same
time, it fleshes out the history of her extended family, showing us
their lives before the rise of the Nazis as well as their eventual
fates.
</P>
<P>
   The Anne Frank who emerges from this biography is a familiar
figure, of course: lively, charming, passionate, alternately
introspective and restless, philosophical and girlish. Because Anne
wrote so lucidly and was so observant, however, she emerges from
the diary as mature beyond her years _ often wiser and more
ruminative than the young woman portrayed by Ms. Muller. Indeed,
Anne comes across in this biography as a headstrong, mercurial girl
with lots of friends and admirers, a girl who, Ms. Muller writes,
was ``too sharp-tongued for some, too combative and know-it-all for
others.''
</P>
<P>
   This Anne _ who dreamed of becoming a famous actress or writer _
liked to be the center of attention, and when she wasn't, ``she'd
resort to tears in order to get her way.'' She seemed convinced as
a child, Ms. Muller writes, ``that God and the world adored her.''
It was only as she entered the moody, tumultuous landscape of
adolescence and was forced, simultaneously, to confront the
prospect of her own annihilation that her dreaminess gave way to
hard-fought idealism, her infectious energy to an unsentimental
wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that made the diary so poignant and one of the
things that lend this biography such power is the awful
juxtaposition of the ordinary and the horrific, the mundane and the
unimaginable. Seeing Anne and her friend Hanneli jumping rope and
playing hide-and-seek in an Amsterdam park one moment; then seeing
them meet again several years later, in a Nazi camp, trying to
speak to each other through a straw-packed fence. Picturing Anne's
collection of favorite photos (Greta Garbo, Ray Milland and the
future Queen Elizabeth) on the attic wall by her bed; then
picturing the arrival of the German security officer and the Dutch
henchmen who have come to arrest the Franks and take them away.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Muller makes clear, Anne only gradually became aware of
the perils of the Nazi threat: In the months before the Frank
family went into hiding, her parents tried to protect her and her
sister from the reality of what was happening in Europe. Initially
her awareness of the German occupation of the Netherlands was
defined by a child's acutely personal sense of deprivation:
``Because of them,'' Ms. Muller writes, ``her birthday had not been
celebrated as grandly as she had expected, and she would not be
able to go to Switzerland in the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Those deprivations would grow increasingly acute, as the Nazis
tightened their grip on the Netherlands and restricted the rights
of the Jews. By the time the Franks, like some 20,000 other Jews in
the Netherlands, had decided that going into hiding was the only
alternative to deportation, Jews had been forbidden access to movie
theaters, swimming pools, parks, spas, hotels, libraries, theaters,
museums and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout their ordeal, the Franks kept hoping that something
would stop the Nazi juggernaut, that the Allies would arrive in
time, that some miracle of God would save them. They very nearly
made it. The train with the Franks on it was the last train to
leave the Netherlands for Auschwitz. And Anne and her sister,
Margot, died of typhus only a few weeks before British troops
arrived to liberate the camp where they met their end,
Bergen-Belsen, in April 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Frank was 15 years old.

BERMAN ON CALL   FOR SOX-INDIANS EVENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No sense talking about long-range playoff television schedules
just yet. You-know-who might be playing in you-know- what, and the
mere thought sends the already paranoid back to their closets.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence of things not won is too much to ignore. Heck, when
it comes to Red Sox Nation, they are cursed.
</P>
<P>
   No more so than the Cleveland Indians, though. As Chris Berman
said, ``They are the two lost causes of the American League.''
</P>
<P>
   But before we talk about the Curse of Rocky Colavito or Jose
Mesa, let's go right to the television schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Not the whole schedule, mind you. Just the three games that we
know will take place. ESPN has the first, Tuesday at 1 p.m., Game 2
is Wednesday at 1 p.m., and Game 3 will be Friday at Fenway Park at
4 p.m. Chris Berman and Ray Knight call each of these games.
</P>
<P>
   Berman is no stranger to Fenway. No, he didn't cover the
American League playoff game in 1948, which, by the way, was played
in Boston and pitted the Red Sox against the Indians. (The Red Sox
lost, 8-3.)
</P>
<P>
   But Berman was in the broadcast booth in 1975 when the
Cincinnati Reds played the Red Sox. He was a Young Boomer then, a
junior at Brown University. NBC had hired him to be a ``glorified
runner'' and he gophered for Dick Stockton and the legendary Ned
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   When Bernie Carbo hit a pinch-hit home run in the eighth inning
of Game 6, Berman was in the booth with Stockton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't remember it at all, but I was an impressionable kid
and remembered everything that happened,'' Berman recalled. ``When
Carbo hit the home run, it was one of those moments when you wanted
to let out a yell. But I couldn't because I wasn't allowed to speak
or talk. But my eyes met Stockton's and we gave each other a
thumbs-up sign. Again I couldn't say anything because I was just a
runner. I would have been fired.''
</P>
<P>
   So Friday's game is a milestone of sorts: It will be the first
time that Berman is allowed to speak on air during a postseason
game at Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a heck of a series,'' Berman said. ``Both
teams have stumbled in September. The Red Sox have better starting
pitchers. But the Indians have a better batting order from top to
bottom. This series could easily go five games and be memorable.''

Aces Johnson, Brown face off in divisional series opener
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
San Diego righthander Kevin Brown's regular-season numbers are
worthy of mention for the National League Cy Young Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at least one Astros player isn't impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't give anybody credit until after they do something,''
Astros center fielder Carl Everett said. ``He has to pitch (today),
so right now, who is Kevin Brown?''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the Padres' starter in today's divisional series opener
at the Astrodome, was second in the NL with a 2.38 earned-run
average. His 18 victories were third-highest in the league. He was
second in strikeouts with 257.
</P>
<P>
   And, by the way, he has a World Series ring as a member of last
year's Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Everett still isn't impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your past history doesn't do nothing for you when you haven't
played yet,'' Everett said. ``He could've had 120 strikeouts in 10
games, but he's 0-0 with no strikeouts. He hasn't done anything
yet, hasn't lifted his arm. He's nothing until he does something.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's counterpart for today's game, Astros lefthander Randy
Johnson, has been just as impressive this season, in half the time.
Since being acquired from Seattle on July 31, Johnson is 10-1 with
a 1.28 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Between the American and National Leagues, Johnson is a combined
19-11 with 10 complete games, six shutouts and a major
league-leading 329 strikeouts, the highest total since Nolan Ryan's
341 for the Angels in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson pitched four consecutive shutouts at the Dome and has
allowed only two earned runs at home in 43 innings.
</P>
<P>
   While still with the Mariners, Johnson faced the Padres on June
24 in San Diego, striking out 12 in Seattle's 2-1 victory. He
allowed one run and six hits in nine innings. San Diego's Tony
Gwynn, Ken Caminiti, Steve Finely and Jim Leyritz went a combined
0-for-15 in the game. Greg Vaughn, who had 50 home runs in 1998,
and Quilvio Veras, had the most success, both going 2-for-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine anybody in their right mind saying, `Oh yeah,
we get to face Randy Johnson,''' said Gwynn. ``Probably the biggest
challenge you have as a lefthanded hitter in this league is facing
Randy Johnson. When he's on, you can't hit him.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown has faced the Astros once this season, receiving a
no-decision in San Diego's 5-4, 10-inning victory July 26. He
allowed three runs and seven hits and struck out 10 in eight
innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros say there are several reasons that opponents are
hitting just .235 off Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He throws about a 94-mph sinker, he's righthanded and he
throws from all different angles,'' said Astros second baseman
Craig Biggio, a career .286 hitter against Brown. ``He uses both
sides of the plate and just has some tremendous stuff. He keeps the
ball down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we have to get some guys on and hopefully work the
count a little bit. When you get good pitches to hit off him, it's
like facing a Randy Johnson or Greg Maddux _ you have to take a
hack at it, because he's probably not going to give you another
good one again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the toughest pitchers in the league,'' third
baseman Bill Spiers said. ``He throws hard and his ball moves,
sometimes it looks like it moves up to three feet. He's certainly
one of the toughest pitchers I've faced in the league, no doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Astros have mixed views about facing Brown, the
hard-throwing righthander will have his work cut out against a
Houston lineup with five players hitting over .300.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is not to do too much at one time,'' said Brown, whose
2.33 ERA is the best in the majors the last three seasons. ``You
can only face one guy at a time. If you can keep guys off base, you
can minimize the damage. You can't change your approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros outfielder Moises Alou, a teammate of Brown's in Florida,
said the presence of a No. 1 starter of Brown's caliber makes a
difference, as it did in the Marlins' championship run a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a go-to guy for any team. I'm sure they are going to feel
very confident to have Kevin out there, and we're going to be very
confident to have Randy Johnson,'' Alou said. ``Whoever gets the
most breaks, whoever gets the most luck and whoever comes ready to
play will probably win the first game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres limp into the first round of the playoffs after going
8-15 the final month. Brown is winless in his last four starts.
Johnson, meanwhile, enters with a seven-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   With the Padres' spring training facility in Arizona, they saw
plenty of Johnson while he was with the Mariners. That doesn't make
today's task any easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are talking about a guy that when he is on, he is tough,''
said manager Bruce Bochy, who will likely start the left-handed
hitting Steve Finley and possibly first baseman Wally Joyner, who
has been bothered by a shoulder surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know it. I don't know if it's an advantage that we have
seen him previously. When a guy has the type of stuff he has, I do
not think there is an advantage to have previously faced him.''

 &HT;    Sox, Indians look for identity in playoffs
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One club stumbled to a fourth-straight playoff appearance
winning baseball's worst division. The other struggled through a
terrible final month before holding off Toronto for the wild-card
spot.
</P>
<P>
   What's left is Cleveland versus Boston, two clubs searching for
identity, two teams wondering how far they actually can go.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians still are looking for a world championship. They
missed in 1995 against the Braves and again last year against
Florida, after being just one out away from the title. This year's
team might have tough time just beating Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have liked to have done it better, but you can always
say that,'' manager Mike Hargrove said. ``There are certain things
I was not happy with. We're in the playoffs again, we won our
division, and we have a chance to go the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox look to break a 13-game postseason losing streak
that dates back to 1986 and that fatal play by Bill Buckner against
the Mets in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's to say what's going to happen, but we know we can beat
Cleveland; we know we can win against them,'' Red Sox reliever Tom
Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the Red Sox have better pitching, with a top No. 1
starter in Pedro Martinez, while the Indians' rotation is jumbled;
Cleveland will open with Jamey Wright. Martinez is 19-7 with a 2.89
ERA, while Wright is 12-10 with a 4.72 ERA. But the Indians have
more power, they are a better defensive club, and they have
postseason experience. However, Boston hit .280 this season and
posted a team ERA of 4.19, to Cleveland's numbers of .272. and
4.45, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians also enter the playoffs having lost six of their
last seven games, finishing with just 89 wins. However, last year
they made the Series after winning 86.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox went just 12-15 in September but won six of their
last 10 and did take eight of 11 games against the Indians. The two
clubs met in the division series in 1995, with Cleveland sweeping
three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened in the regular season doesn't mean anything,''
Hargrove said. ``They still might take us three-straight, but we
could take them three-straight, too. The postseason is completely
different.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox might be fighting history more than the Indians.
Boston's last title came in 1918, the Indians in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   But Martinez, the Game 1 starter, said, ``I don't know anything
about the history of this team, and I hope everything changes. We
were picked to be last or maybe close to last in this town, and we
proved them wrong. I hope we can change everything else, and that
includes that damn Bambino curse.''

 &HT;    Volunteers head towards Georges destructionBy Jingle Davis
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hundreds of volunteers and tons of equipment and
supplies are being routed through Atlanta to Gulf Coast locales
hammered Sunday and Monday by Hurricane Georges.
</P>
<P>
   The storm stalled after making landfall Monday near Gulfport,
Miss., battering coastal islands and highways with high winds,
waves and widespread flooding. Power outages affected almost
400,000 customers along the Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Power Co. sent 500 crewmen and support personnel
from around Georgia Sunday night to inland staging areas in
Mississippi, Florida and Alabama to have them poised to move into
storm-damaged areas, said Deryl Belser, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're assisting our sister companies, Mississippi Power, Gulf
Power and Alabama Power, in restoring power,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So much rain was associated with the hurricane that many locales
began measuring rainfall in feet, rather than inches, said Mary
Hudak, a spokeswoman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency
Region IV headquarters in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   She said the agency's headquarters is a hotbed of activity
because FEMA serves as lead coordinating agency for the American
Red Cross and a variety of federal agencies involved in hurricane
relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're expecting pockets of significant damage along the Gulf
Coast,'' she said. ``We're now mobilizing and moving resources that
are not going to be needed in south Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Guard is providing Meals Ready to Eat (MREs),
sandbags and generators to storm-damaged areas, and the Department
of Agriculture is sending 750 cases of food to Hattiesburg, Miss.,
for use in shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The Salvation Army has opened 21 canteens and the Red Cross is
sending 2,000 cots, blankets and comfort kits.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday, the Red Cross metro Atlanta chapter had dispatched
450 volunteers to hurricane-damaged Puerto Rico, south Florida and
the U.S. Virgin Islands, and 100 more volunteers were standing by
in Atlanta for Gulf Coast relief, said spokeswoman Lisa Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're waiting to see what Georges will do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sherberger of the Georgia Emergency Management Agency,
which manages a national coalition of 22 state relief agencies,
said GEMA has already sent teams from Virginia and North Carolina
to assist representives of Gulf Coast states in assessing damages
and needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what we do is not just sending hard goods like food
and water but we help administer a lot of the (relief) programs,
such as emergency cash payments to victims,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At its Fort Gillem staging area south of Atlanta, the Red Cross
loaded five large Emergency Response Vehicles, nicknamed ERVs, with
food and medical supplies on Monday. Another 30 ERVs from as far
away as Iowa and Connecticut were parked at a Smyrna motel, waiting
to be deployed.

 &HT;    Although program faces cuts, Georgia's Medicaid to expand
benefits
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia's Medicaid program, facing another directive
to cut its budget, nevertheless plans to expand benefits to its
members next year.
</P>
<P>
   And to shore up its HMO option, Medicaid has approved a 5
percent increase in the rate it pays to health maintenance
organizations for caring for its beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed revisions come as the Department of Medical
Assistance, like all other state agencies, faces another 5 percent
budget ordered by Gov. Zell Miller for the fiscal 2000 budget,
which begins in July.
</P>
<P>
   DMA runs the federal-state Medicaid program for 1.2 million
low-income Georgians.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO rate hike follows the recent exit of two HMOs serving
Medicaid patients: FamilyPlus and AmeriCan Medical Plans. Each
organization cited the state's relatively low payment for HMO
services.
</P>
<P>
   The sole remaining HMO that's actively recruiting Medicaid
members is Grady Healthcare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, raising the rate is the right thing, but at the wrong
time,'' said Brent Layton of Atlanta consulting firm Layton &AMP;
Associates. ``Six months ago, three health plans were offering
Medicaid managed care. Now it's down to one.''
</P>
<P>
   The budget proposal for Medicaid, which has gone to the
governor's office and later must be approved by the General
Assembly, features new benefits and program expansions, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ A 24-hour nurse call program, giving beneficiaries instant
medical advice and steering them to appropriate services.
</P>
<P>
   _ An annual dental exam and cleaning, and up to two fillings a
year, for adult Medicaid members. Currently, the program covers
only extractions for adults.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eye exams and new eyeglasses once every two years for adults,
who have neither service currently.
</P>
<P>
   _ A reduction in the waiting list for home-based services of
5,000 Georgians who are frail elderly or disabled, and are
otherwise eligible for nursing-home placement.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid also plans stronger supervision of its non-emergency
transportation system. A new broker system, where regional
contractors are paid a fixed amount for transporting patients, has
reduced fraud but sparked numerous complaints about vans not
showing up to deliver rides.
</P>
<P>
   ``No-shows are unacceptable,'' said DMA Commissioner William
Taylor, who added that the current system may be scrapped, or at
least monitored more closely. DMA may combine with the state
Department of Human Resources on a new transportation arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   The overall budget cuts will be achieved partly through DMA's
anti-fraud efforts, where about 50 more investigators and other
staff have been added. At least $30 million in fines and
restititution have been ordered through Medicaid fraud prosecutions
since July 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Other savings would come from changes in programs covering
pharmacy, rehab, laboratory, hospice and outpatient services.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians under DMA's budget plan would receive a reimbursement
increase for delivering primary-care services. But GHA, an
association of Georgia hospitals, foresees at least $54 million in
Medicaid cuts affecting the state's hospitals, which are already
contending with reductions from Medicare and managed care plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand why we continue to face Medicaid cuts when
the overall state budget projects a surplus,'' said Joe Parker,
president of GHA.

   A few days ago, the owners of the Arizona Diamondbacks slapped
their supporters in the face by announcing a fat hike in season
ticket prices for next season.

<P>
   They did this on what had been declared fan (begin ital)

</P>
<P>
   The day after being kicked in their bellies, abuse victims
filled the Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Patrons in attendance that day managed to complain a little,
telling reporters things like, ``Is that fan appreciation for
everyone who helped pay for the ballpark?''
</P>
<P>
   And, ``It's such a turnoff, so typical of big business in
sports.''
</P>
<P>

with disbelief and _ if we're honest about it _ a little disdain,

<P>
   The difference here, of course, is that even in the ugly world
of domestic violence, there aren't many abuse victims who are
willing pay to be pounded.
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County taxpayers handed over $235 million to the
Diamondbacks and its dominant authority figure, Jerry Colangelo.

</P>
<P>
   The team lost, we paid. The team continued losing, we continued
paying. And now, after losing more than any team in its division,
the team wants us to pay even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``If fans want us to get better, we have to do these things,''
team President Rich Dozier said. ``We're just trying to be
competitive. We think the fans want us to be competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   What they really think, is that they can get away with this.
</P>
<P>
   Because they already have, many times.
</P>
<P>
   The fans keep coming back.
</P>
<P>
   Already the Diamondbacks are among the most profitable
franchises in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   They're among the top in attendance. They are among the top in
merchandising. They are among the top in advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   As it is, a working stiff with a few kids can't afford to attend

Aces Johnson, Brown face off in divisional series opener
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
San Diego righthander Kevin Brown's regular-season numbers are
worthy of mention for the National League Cy Young Award.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at least one Astros player isn't impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't give anybody credit until after they do something,''
Astros center fielder Carl Everett said. ``He has to pitch (today),
so right now, who is Kevin Brown?''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the Padres' starter in today's divisional series opener
at the Astrodome, was second in the NL with a 2.38 earned-run
average. His 18 victories were third-highest in the league. He was
second in strikeouts with 257.
</P>
<P>
   And, by the way, he has a World Series ring as a member of last
year's Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Everett still isn't impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your past history doesn't do nothing for you when you haven't
played yet,'' Everett said. ``He could've had 120 strikeouts in 10
games, but he's 0-0 with no strikeouts. He hasn't done anything
yet, hasn't lifted his arm. He's nothing until he does something.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's counterpart for today's game, Astros lefthander Randy
Johnson, has been just as impressive this season, in half the time.
Since being acquired from Seattle on July 31, Johnson is 10-1 with
a 1.28 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Between the American and National Leagues, Johnson is a combined
19-11 with 10 complete games, six shutouts and a major
league-leading 329 strikeouts, the highest total since Nolan Ryan's
341 for the Angels in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson pitched four consecutive shutouts at the Dome and has
allowed only two earned runs at home in 43 innings.
</P>
<P>
   While still with the Mariners, Johnson faced the Padres on June
24 in San Diego, striking out 12 in Seattle's 2-1 victory. He
allowed one run and six hits in nine innings. San Diego's Tony
Gwynn, Ken Caminiti, Steve Finely and Jim Leyritz went a combined
0-for-15 in the game. Greg Vaughn, who had 50 home runs in 1998,
and Quilvio Veras, had the most success, both going 2-for-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine anybody in their right mind saying, `Oh yeah,
we get to face Randy Johnson,''' said Gwynn. ``Probably the biggest
challenge you have as a lefthanded hitter in this league is facing
Randy Johnson. When he's on, you can't hit him.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown has faced the Astros once this season, receiving a
no-decision in San Diego's 5-4, 10-inning victory July 26. He
allowed three runs and seven hits and struck out 10 in eight
innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros say there are several reasons that opponents are
hitting just .235 off Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He throws about a 94-mph sinker, he's righthanded and he
throws from all different angles,'' said Astros second baseman
Craig Biggio, a career .286 hitter against Brown. ``He uses both
sides of the plate and just has some tremendous stuff. He keeps the
ball down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we have to get some guys on and hopefully work the
count a little bit. When you get good pitches to hit off him, it's
like facing a Randy Johnson or Greg Maddux _ you have to take a
hack at it, because he's probably not going to give you another
good one again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the toughest pitchers in the league,'' third
baseman Bill Spiers said. ``He throws hard and his ball moves,
sometimes it looks like it moves up to three feet. He's certainly
one of the toughest pitchers I've faced in the league, no doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Astros have mixed views about facing Brown, the
hard-throwing righthander will have his work cut out against a
Houston lineup with five players hitting over .300.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is not to do too much at one time,'' said Brown, whose
2.33 ERA is the best in the majors the last three seasons. ``You
can only face one guy at a time. If you can keep guys off base, you
can minimize the damage. You can't change your approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros outfielder Moises Alou, a teammate of Brown's in Florida,
said the presence of a No. 1 starter of Brown's caliber makes a
difference, as it did in the Marlins' championship run a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a go-to guy for any team. I'm sure they are going to feel
very confident to have Kevin out there, and we're going to be very
confident to have Randy Johnson,'' Alou said. ``Whoever gets the
most breaks, whoever gets the most luck and whoever comes ready to
play will probably win the first game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres limp into the first round of the playoffs after going
8-15 the final month. Brown is winless in his last four starts.
Johnson, meanwhile, enters with a seven-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   With the Padres' spring training facility in Arizona, they saw
plenty of Johnson while he was with the Mariners. That doesn't make
today's task any easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are talking about a guy that when he is on, he is tough,''
said manager Bruce Bochy, who will likely start the left-handed
hitting Steve Finley and possibly first baseman Wally Joyner, who
has been bothered by a shoulder surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know it. I don't know if it's an advantage that we have
seen him previously. When a guy has the type of stuff he has, I do
not think there is an advantage to have previously faced him.''

 &HT;    CEO of Crawford announces resignationBy Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Crawford &AMP; Co. announced Monday that Dennis A. Smith,
president, chairman and chief executive, resigned as an officer and
director of the Atlanta-based risk and claims management services
company.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's immediately effective departure, the company said, was
prompted by his desire ``to pursue other opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also announced that Smith, 49, will be replaced as
chairman and chief executive by Forrest L. Minix, 71, and as
president and chief operating officer by Archie L. Meyers Jr., 62.
</P>
<P>
   Minix is Smith's predecessor, having served as chairman and
chief executive from 1988 to 1995. Smith took over the top jobs
Jan. 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford &AMP; Co. class A stock closed at $17, down 25 cents, on
45,500 shares, more than seven times the average volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although this was a surprise to us, we do not anticipate any
directional change at Crawford,'' said Robinson-Humphrey analyst
David O. Lewis said. ``We believe the company will continue
building its organization to achieve strong double-digit growth
beginning in 1999. We continue to forecast (earnings per share of)
99 cents for 1998 and $1.18 for 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford &AMP; Co. spokesman Judd F. Osten declined to comment on
the change, and Smith could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Meyers, the newly-named president, previously served as
president of claims management services.
</P>
<P>
   Smith had been with Crawford &AMP; Co. He became president and chief
operating officer in November 1994.

 &HT;    Although program faces cuts, Georgia's Medicaid to expand
benefits
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia's Medicaid program, facing another directive
to cut its budget, nevertheless plans to expand benefits to its
members next year.
</P>
<P>
   And to shore up its HMO option, Medicaid has approved a 5
percent increase in the rate it pays to health maintenance
organizations for caring for its beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed revisions come as the Department of Medical
Assistance, like all other state agencies, faces another 5 percent
budget ordered by Gov. Zell Miller for the fiscal 2000 budget,
which begins in July.
</P>
<P>
   DMA runs the federal-state Medicaid program for 1.2 million
low-income Georgians.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO rate hike follows the recent exit of two HMOs serving
Medicaid patients: FamilyPlus and AmeriCan Medical Plans. Each
organization cited the state's relatively low payment for HMO
services.
</P>
<P>
   The sole remaining HMO that's actively recruiting Medicaid
members is Grady Healthcare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, raising the rate is the right thing, but at the wrong
time,'' said Brent Layton of Atlanta consulting firm Layton &AMP;
Associates. ``Six months ago, three health plans were offering
Medicaid managed care. Now it's down to one.''
</P>
<P>
   The budget proposal for Medicaid, which has gone to the
governor's office and later must be approved by the General
Assembly, features new benefits and program expansions, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ A 24-hour nurse call program, giving beneficiaries instant
medical advice and steering them to appropriate services.
</P>
<P>
   _ An annual dental exam and cleaning, and up to two fillings a
year, for adult Medicaid members. Currently, the program covers
only extractions for adults.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eye exams and new eyeglasses once every two years for adults,
who have neither service currently.
</P>
<P>
   _ A reduction in the waiting list for home-based services of
5,000 Georgians who are frail elderly or disabled, and are
otherwise eligible for nursing-home placement.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid also plans stronger supervision of its non-emergency
transportation system. A new broker system, where regional
contractors are paid a fixed amount for transporting patients, has
reduced fraud but sparked numerous complaints about vans not
showing up to deliver rides.
</P>
<P>
   ``No-shows are unacceptable,'' said DMA Commissioner William
Taylor, who added that the current system may be scrapped, or at
least monitored more closely. DMA may combine with the state
Department of Human Resources on a new transportation arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   The overall budget cuts will be achieved partly through DMA's
anti-fraud efforts, where about 50 more investigators and other
staff have been added. At least $30 million in fines and
restititution have been ordered through Medicaid fraud prosecutions
since July 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Other savings would come from changes in programs covering
pharmacy, rehab, laboratory, hospice and outpatient services.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians under DMA's budget plan would receive a reimbursement
increase for delivering primary-care services. But GHA, an
association of Georgia hospitals, foresees at least $54 million in
Medicaid cuts affecting the state's hospitals, which are already
contending with reductions from Medicare and managed care plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand why we continue to face Medicaid cuts when
the overall state budget projects a surplus,'' said Joe Parker,
president of GHA.

JIMY WILLIAMS: A STORIED MANAGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ He has stories, all right. Like the time he was
playing shortstop for Don Zimmer in Indianapolis, and Zim was
sitting at the front of a bus that was eating up rubber on some
two-lane country blacktop and Zim told Shorty Raudman to come up
front, he wanted to talk to him.
</P>
<P>
   No response. Just a (italic)ping, ping, ping(unitals) coming
from the back of the bus.
</P>
<P>
   Shorty, Zim said. Come up here.
</P>
<P>
   (italic)Ping. ping. ping.(uniatls)
</P>
<P>
   Shorty!
</P>
<P>
   Ping. Ping. Ping.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Zim lifted his squat body out of his seat and with some
annoyance headed toward the back.
</P>
<P>
   And where was Shorty?
</P>
<P>
   ``He was on top of the bus, shooting at rabbits,'' said Jimy
Williams, who took great delight in imitating the high whine of the
bullets that sprayed both sides of the road, courtesy of the gun
that Shorty Raudman had smuggled onto the team bus.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Jimy Williams has stories, almost as many stories as the
wrinkles in a mid-50s face weathered by too many cloudless
afternoons spent on too many dusty diamonds with a skinny fungo bat
in his callused hands, a half-dozen baseballs stuffed in his back
pocket, ever ready to accommodate any infielder, be it Nomar
Garciaparra or the most obscure minor leaguer, willing to take one
more groundball.
</P>
<P>
   When your day begins at the ballpark at noon for a 7 o'clock
game, the days blending into seasons into decades, there is always
time for stories.
</P>
<P>
   But the one story Jimy Williams is reluctant to tell may be the
best one of all. The one about the poor skinny kid with the Irish
mother who had seven kids and taught in a one-room schoolhouse, and
the Irish father who tried to eke out a living as a cattle rancher
on the central California coast.
</P>
<P>
   The one about the kid who learned to ride a horse at 3 and
showed cattle at all the 4-H shows, but had grander plans. The one
about the kid who willed himself into becoming a good ballplayer,
one who attracted the attention of Hall of Famer Bobby Doerr, who
signed him to his first pro contract, then hurt his shoulder in the
freakest of accidents _ flinging a styrofoam cup and hearing the
tendons in his shoulder rip like cheap tissue.
</P>
<P>
   The one about the young man who reluctantly put away his bats
and balls and worked in a convenience store in St. Louis, the
``Short Way,'' whose very name mocked how far he stood from the
dream that once gripped him like a fever.
</P>
<P>
   And then, the one about how a former college teammate remembered
the passion, intensity and work ethic of that same kid and offered
him a ticket back into the game, as a minor league manager. And how
that kid seized that chance and never let it go, until it brought
him here, the surprise manager of perhaps the surprise team in
baseball's playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Jimy Williams never was very good about talking about himself.
He'd sooner call himself a ``peanut head,'' like he did a couple of
weeks ago in Baltimore, than allow that maybe he deserves as much
credit for the Red Sox success this season as everybody else he
mentions, a list that rivals any thank-you speech made on Oscar
night.
</P>
<P>
   So, it's best left to others to tell Jimy Williams' story.
Especially people who were there at the beginning, like his college
roommates Manny Fagundes and Dennis Simonian, and never left. They
know Williams' love for the game runs so deep, that when he married
Peggy Sallee, his best man was Gene ``Peewee'' Fraser, his high
school baseball coach who had become a second father to him after
his own father died while he was still a teen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember riding our bikes every Sunday to church,'' said
Fagundes, who is now in the insurance business,``and then coming
back and hitting, all afternoon. Used to drive me crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was midnight basketball. Fagundes was a student
teacher, and had keys to the high school gym. ``A group of us would
go and play until 2 or 3 in the morning,'' Fagundes said. ``Jimy
was a good shooter, and so competitive. Winners would ride back in
his pickup. Losers had to jog back.''
</P>
<P>
   During spring training this year, Jimy Williams made a point of
going to see a hot-shooting guard at a local high school, Teddy
Dupay. When the kid came to a Sox exhibition, he and Williams posed
for pictures, with Williams thanking him for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimy has no pretense, that's exactly right,'' Fagundes said.
``He's comfortable with all kinds of people. I've seen him in very
formal settings, and with cowboys at the rodeo. He's really good
with people. It doesn't matter who you are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the people who are real happy with what he's done are
the regular people in the world, because he doesn't kowtow to
people because of who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Simonian owns a major produce business in Fresno, but back then,
he and his sister ran a little stand, and he'd have Williams pick
fruit for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even today he can walk into a grocery store,'' Simonian said,
``and tell you the best watermelon to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Simonian can tell you why Williams wears his Red Sox jacket the
odd way he does, with the bottom two buttons left open.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to do that in college,'' Simonian said. ``We had these
button-down sweaters, and we wouldn't button the bottom two
buttons. It was a '60s deal.
</P>
<P>
   Simonian did wish Williams would listen to one fashion tip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell him to wear his hat the right way,'' he said with a
laugh. ``His hat's a size too small. The way he wears it, he leaves
a little bird's nest on the top of the cap.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Sommers is another one whose connections to Williams runs
back to Fresno State, which at the time was coached by local legend
Pete Biden. Sommers played third base next to Williams, went on to
become the youngest farm director in the big leagues when he was
promoted by the Angels, then hired Williams to his first job as
minor-league manager, for the Quad Cities Class A team in
Davenport, Iowa in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was working in the convenience store in St. Louis,''
Sommers said. ``I did a lot of research on him, because he was such
a close, long-time friend, I sure didn't want to turn around and
fire him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very, very hard-working guy, the most dedicated
ballplayer I'd ever seen. If Pete Biden said be on the field at 3,
he'd be on at 2. If we were off the field at 6, he'd be there 'til
8.''
</P>
<P>
   Sommers' one fear is that college men were not exactly plentiful
in pro ball at that time. ``They called us college hotdogs,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He wondered whether Williams might have trouble winning
acceptance. Not to worry. ``He fit in immediately,'' Sommers said.
``He was a popular manager at Quad Cities. Jimy is a hard-nosed
baseball guy, but he had fun, too. He didn't put himself over
anybody. There's a real humility about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no question in my mind at all that he'd be a big
league manager. He had all the qualities.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Gillick promoted Williams to his first major league managing
job in 1986 with Toronto. Three years later, Gillick made Williams
the only Blue Jays manager ever fired in the middle of a season. He
now admits that Williams didn't get the front-office backing he
deserved, especially in a much-celebrated run-in with slugger
George Bell, who in spring training humiliated Williams by refusing
to go along with Williams' mandate that he was no longer the
leftfielder, but the DH.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Jay watchers will never forget the sight of Williams
marching down the foul line to fetch Bell, who wouldn't budge.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, Gillick said, the Blue Jays should have suspended
Bell. But fearing a union grievance, they backed off, which gave
the impression that Williams lacked the authority to make his
decisions stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were many people there who felt we didn't back Jimy, and
probably we didn't back him the way we should have,'' Gillick said.
``That really urt him, but again there were extenuating
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back at it, if the situation happened again and having
the experience I have now, with George Bell, I would have said
forget about the consequences, forget about the grievance, forget
about the union. Either you DH or go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' friends saw a change in his personality, an inward
turning, an insecurity that he didn't know where to look for
support. The Bell incident happened in 1998; a year later, Gillick
fired Williams. ``He'd lost a little bit of control of the club,''
Gillick said. ``I wouldn't say control, but he lost the confidence
of the club. ``And if they lose confidence, it's time to make a
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams nursed his wounds and rejoined Bobby Cox, whom he'd
succeeded as manager in Toronto, as a third-base coach in Atlanta.
He was one of the best in the business, and with the Braves
becoming the team of the '90s, Williams' name surfaced again for
managing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   He was a finalist for the expansion Marlins in 1993. He was
interviewed for the Angels' job, though it still irks his friends
that the Angels official who quizzed Williams did so with one eye
on a hockey game on TV.
</P>
<P>
   When Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette, who had just fired
Kevin Kennedy, asked Gillick about Williams during the 1996 World
Series, Gillick endorsed the man he'd fired, and a month later,
much to the surprise of Sox watchers who had seen Duquette court
Jim Leyland and Whitey Herzog, among others, Williams was hired.
</P>
<P>
   In the papers, at least, it was not a popular move, and Williams
was mocked after his introductory press conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when he called me right after he was hired in
Boston,'' Fagundes said, ``and I asked him, what are you going to
do differently?
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I'm going to do it the way I want to do it and not
worry about what people say and write. I'll do it my way.'''
</P>
<P>
   And while he is a good company man, Williams has not been afraid
to chart his own course. When he had to move John Valentin out of
shortstop to make room for then-rookie Nomar Garciaparra, Williams
kept the situation from becoming another Bell-like fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   He stood up to Duquette last fall when he gave pitcher Steve
Avery the start that triggered a $3.9 million option for this
season, and endured the Wilfredo Cordero crisis without making the
player feel he'd been abandoned. He never allowed Mo Vaughn's
ongoing battles with the front office infect the clubhouse, and he
showed he was a master at using his entire roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimy is one of those guys who can cope with a difficult
situation and keep his head up,'' Gillick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing he can do is take a chance on a guy. He's not
afraid to use everybody. I think he's done that with a number of
players. I think he's a real good fit for Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   His friends couldn't agree more. And as much as he loves his
job, he's at a point in his life where there are certain things he
won't sacrifice for it. There's a wife and four kids who'll always
love him, even when the talk shows, or the bosses, stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard him say it several times, if they want to fire me,
they can fire me,'' Simonian said. ``Jimy Williams is going to
stand up for what he believes is right.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe someday, Jimy Williams will tell that story himself.

Johnson represents tall order for Astros' playoff foes
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
OOne man doesn't win a championship.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one man can do only so much in terms of putting a team
in position to compete for the ultimate prize.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros were a delicious potpourri long before Johnson moved
from Seattle to Houston. But the scent of a champion was never
stronger than when the Big Unit first planted himself on the mound
wearing an Astros uniform.
</P>
<P>
   One man can do only so much, and Johnson has.
</P>
<P>
   He has done so much for morale that players are constantly
praising management for sending him their way. He has done so much
for attendance that his starts were the hottest ticket in town. He
has done so much on the mound that it's not a reach to throw his
name into consideration for the National League Cy Young Award
despite the fact he has been in the league for only two months.
</P>
<P>
   More important, he has done so much for the Astros, they are
favored to represent the NL in the World Series in some circles.
That's an astronomical accomplishment in a city that has launched
men to the moon but never has propelled its baseball team into the
Fall Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, you might not have a problem now that Johnson is in
town.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we traded for Randy, we knew we were getting a pitcher
who could match up with any pitcher in the game,'' Astros general
manager Gerry Hunsicker said of the July 31 deal. ``He's been one
of the best in the business, and he's been everything we hoped he
would be and more. We're trying to get to another level as an
organization, and getting Randy Johnson certainly gives us a better
chance to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has been quick to point out that he is not the Astros'
savior, and he's right. He won only 10 of his 11 starts with the
Astros, proving that even larger-than-life figures are human.
</P>
<P>
   With star-quality players such as Moises Alou, Jeff Bagwell,
Derek Bell, Craig Biggio and a host of other dangerous weapons, the
Astros hardly needed a savior. However, they did need a guardian
angel to descend onto the pitcher's mound and work his magic every
fifth day.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the Astros needed a pitcher who could take a
playoff series into the palm of his hand and squish the life out of
anyone who threatens to come between the Astros and a World Series
championship. Beating the Astros in the playoffs likely will mean
beating Johnson twice, and that's a scary proposition for any team
faced with that challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a lift for our team to get him,'' Astros manager
Larry Dierker said of Johnson. ``We have a lot of good pitchers,
but we really didn't have anyone in the rotation who could dominate
a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a starter who could come out and say, `OK, you
guys don't score or hit today.' At times, Randy can say that. We
had good pitchers but not guys who are going to throw stuff you
can't hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering how dominant Johnson has been in an Astros uniform,
one could almost interpret Dierker's assessment literally. When the
35-year-old lefthander is on the mound, the opposition does very
little hitting, and its odds of scoring are even worse.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 10-1 with a 1.28 earned run average with the Astros,
has allowed only 57 hits in 84 innings since the trade, and he has
held opponents to a .191 batting average. Only 12 batters have made
their way around the bases against Johnson, who has allowed just
two runs in 43 innings at the Astrodome. Including his four months
in Seattle, Johnson has a major-league-leading 329 strikeouts,
tying for the seventh-best total in history.
</P>
<P>
   New league, new team, new environment _ same results.
</P>
<P>
   No matter which uniform he's disguised in, the Big Unit is well,
the Big Unit.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever he is, hype, strikeouts and wins won't be far behind.
Two of those three variables are irrelevant to Johnson, who wears
his competitive emotions on the sleeve of his uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's a stare, a scowl, a slap on the chest with his
glove or a thrust through the air with his fist, Johnson has only
one thing on his mind when he takes the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite letter in the alphabet is `W,''' said Johnson,
whose four NL shutouts were second only to Atlanta's Greg Maddux.
``Just win the game. That's what I'm out there to do. Strikeouts
are fine and dandy, but I don't care about that stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I care about is putting our team in a position to win. The
reason I'm pitching Game 1 in the playoffs is because there's a
chance that I can give us a chance to win. I don't care if it's a
playoff game or a regular-season game; my mentality is no
different. I'm out there to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning the first game of every series is always critical and
always important. It kind of dictates the rest of the series, and
any time I have an opportunity to pitch the first game of a series,
I take a great deal of pride in that. Putting a `W' up there means
a great deal to me and a great deal to the guys in this
clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Johnson the bona fide ace the Astros had lacked, but
he's also one of the most intimidating pitchers in the history of
baseball. He has a 6-foot-10 frame, a 98-mph fastball and more
pitching savvy than Warner Cable has channels.
</P>
<P>
   When he's tuned in, there's no scrambling the Big Unit's signal.
It might be wiser to take a bath with your television set than to
distract Johnson on the day of a start.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really intense on the days that he pitches,'' Dierker
said. ``I just try to stay out of his way until it's over. After
it's over, he's OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's great in the clubhouse between starts, but he's got his
own way of getting ready to pitch, and it's mostly a
confrontational, challenging demeanor. He has the stuff to support
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he goes through such a metamorphosis on the days he
pitches, it's easy to see why Johnson is so misunderstood. It took
most of his 10 years in Seattle before the Mariners fully
understood his complexities, and even then he left under
allegations that he wasn't putting all of himself into every
pitching performance.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson doesn't expect his new baseball family to know him
backward and forward after just two months. He doesn't expect them
to understand why he took out his frustrations on some light bulbs
after holding the Pirates to two runs and notching 12 strikeouts
during a game in which the Big Unit said he lost his focus during
the final two innings.
</P>
<P>
   But if there's one thing everyone should understand, it's the
depth of his competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone here really knows my makeup or what I'm
all about,'' Johnson said. ``In my last years in Seattle, I think
they started to figure out that all I really cared about was
winning ballgames. I'm very competitive. There are times when you
hear other people's names and they'll say, `That person is a
competitor.' Well, that person is no more competitive than I am.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm competitive in anything I do. When I go out and pitch _ I
only get to go out there every five days _ it's my day to do my
thing out there, and if I don't do it well, I've let myself down
and I've let my teammates down because when I go out there my
teammates expect me to win. I take a great deal of pride in that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just me, and that's why I feel I'm at the level I'm at.
I feel like I'm right there with all the other best pitchers in
baseball. That's what separates the best from the real good to the
guys who are still learning and trying to put it all together.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting swept in the first round of the playoffs last
season, the Astros are trying to put it all together for a run at
the World Series, and the biggest, most complex piece of the puzzle
is ready to be snapped into place.
</P>
<P>
   Beware, NL pennant contenders. The Astros have an ace up their
sleeve.

WIDEN ACCESS TO METHODONE, URGES TOP WHITE HOUSE DRUG OFFICIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Conn., N.H., Vt., W.Va., Miss., N.D., S.D.,
Mont., Idaho)  (lh) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Disregarding New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
criticism of methadone, the White House's top drug policy official
plans Tuesday to recommend expanding the availability of the drug.
</P>
<P>
   The White House official, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, is expected to
outline a major overhaul of federal methadone policy to treat
heroin addiction in a speech Tuesday to a national conference of
the American Methadone Treatment Association in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals by McCaffrey, which incorporate suggestions from
government agencies and other specialists in substance abuse,
recommend that qualified physicians be allowed to administer
methadone to patients in the privacy of their offices. Methadone is
now dispensed at special clinics. The times when it is dispensed
can make it difficult for some recovering addicts to hold down
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey is urging that methadone treatment be made available
to any addict who requests and needs it. Methadone is currently
used by 115,000 Americans addicted to heroin. They account for a
fraction of the country's estimated 810,000 opiate addicts, some of
whom cannot find treatment slots that would give them access to
methadone.
</P>
<P>
   The policy paper, a copy of which was made available to The New
York Times, is being released at a time when Giuliani has
questioned the need for methadone treatment. The mayor has said
that he wants to end the government's role in providing the drug, a
synthetic substance used to curb the craving for heroin.
</P>
<P>
   The administration intends to begin redrafting the federal
regulations governing methadone in December or January. Officials
said they doubted that congressional approval would be needed for
any of the changes and foresaw no barriers at the federal level.
</P>
<P>
   States have wide control over the availability of methadone,
however. New York state is the country's largest methadone
provider, and Connecticut has considered giving doctors a more
central role in dispensing it. But eight states _ New Hampshire,
Vermont, West Virginia, Mississippi, North Dakota, South Dakota,
Montana and Idaho _ do not permit methadone clinics, forcing
residents who feel they need it to travel to other states.
</P>
<P>
   The expectation is that a stronger endorsement of methadone's
efficacy by the federal government will encourage comparable
changes in at least some states.
</P>
<P>
   Among other changes, McCaffrey plans to urge that the Food and
Drug Administration turn over the regulation of methadone to the
Mental Health and Human Services Administration. He also plans to
suggest creating a comprehensive evaluation and accreditation
system to assess methadone treatment at clinics, which vary widely
in the quality and quantity of services.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Giuliani has sharply criticized methadone treatment, describing
the physical dependence it creates as tantamount to enslavement,
and has criticized McCaffrey for endorsing it. On Monday, the mayor
fired a fresh broadside at the White House drug policy official.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess General McCaffrey has surrendered,'' Giuliani told
reporters, ``and essentially what he'd like to do is deal with
heroin addiction by making people addicted to methadone, which
maybe even is a worse addiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical specialists have described methadone as the most
effective treatment available for heroin addiction, observing that
it has been studied more thoroughly than almost any other
medication. A recent study by the National Academy of Sciences
called methadone ``more likely to work than any other therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark A.R. Kleiman, professor of public policy at the University
of California at Los Angeles, said in a telephone interview that
the federal changes being announced sound very much like the
recommendations made by the panel of specialists at the National
Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in the field agreed that the panel got it right,''
Kleiman said. ``If what the panel said is going to be policy, I can
only say, hurray.''
</P>
<P>
   Kleiman added, ``The devil's in the details, and I don't know
the details. But breaking methadone free of the shackles of the
methadone treatment system has to be the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to a methadone treatment facility in lower
Manhattan Monday, McCaffrey once more declined to respond in kind
to Giuliani, calling him as ``a great mayor'' who had made New York
City a safer place to live. `
</P>
<P>
   But in an implicit reference to the mayor's criticism, McCaffrey
also cautioned against engaging in ``shoot-from-the-lip policy
analysis.'' He added, ``You've got to be cautious about the reality
of 40,000 people'' in New York state who are enrolled in methadone
maintenance programs.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey got a general endorsement of methadone when he visited
Monday with a half-dozen recovering heroin addicts at the Lower
East Side Service Center on East Broadway. The facility which
provides comprehensive methadone and other drug treatment for 2,500
clients a year, according to its president, Eileen Pencer.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Adorno, who has taken methadone for six years, told
McCaffrey, ``It keeps me functional. I'm able to work and support
my family. Without it, I'd be sick.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gina Neveloff, who takes methadone to stave off the heroin
addiction she acquired as a 15-year-old, said, ``For me, it puts
some kind of sanity back in my life.``
</P>
<P>
   But Scott Riley, who said he became addicted as a soldier in
Vietnam, said that methadone had not worked well for him and that
he had opted for total abstinence, a more difficult alternative
that McCaffrey also endorses.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey, who was badly wounded in Vietnam, appeared moved by
the stories he heard from the former addicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Army, we give big medals to people who are heroes, and
that's what I think you are,'' he said.

IRAQ SAYS IT WON'T LET U.N. RESUME SPOT ARMS CHECKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Iraq will not withdraw its ban on spot arms
inspections, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said on Monday after
a meeting with Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is seeking a comprehensive review of its relations with the
United Nations. Aziz was apparently told at the meeting that Iraq
must rescind the ban before any broad review is undertaken.
</P>
<P>
   The ban has already led the Security Council to suspend its
regular reviews of the economic sanctions it has maintained against
Iraq since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   After the hourlong meeting, the deputy prime minister repeated
that Iraq had already complied with Security Council resolutions
and that the sanctions should be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Therefore the idea that Iraq should do this or that concession
before the comprehensive review takes place is not legal and not
logical,'' a visibly annoyed Aziz told reporters. He is expected to
meet with Security Council members during the week and return for
another session with Annan on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging over these talks is an Iraqi threat to stop all
cooperation with the weapons inspectors. That would effectively
shut down the most ambitious arms monitoring system ever
established in a country that had violated international law.
</P>
<P>
   About 125 inspectors and support staff members are still in
Iraq, backed by a sophisticated array of soil, air and water
samplers as well as on-site video cameras and surveillance
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 9, responding to Iraq's ban on spot inspections, the
Security Council froze all future reviews of the sanctions imposed
after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. Until those reviews
resume, sanctions cannot be lifted. The regular reviews are
separate from the comprehensive review that the Iraqis are seeking.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks the Iraqis have been trying to move the issue
away from the Security Council to the secretary general's office,
building on an agreement they struck with Annan in February, when
he went to Baghdad to defuse a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But diplomats and U.N. officials say the secretary general has
refused to renew his direct involvement and has repeatedly sent the
message to Baghdad that there can be no circumventing of Security
Council resolutions and that spot inspections must resume.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors from the United Nations Special Commission, which
looks for biological and chemical weapons and prohibited missile
systems, and the International Atomic Energy Agency, which watches
nuclear developments, say inspections are vital to the monitoring
system.
</P>
<P>
   Even after sanctions are lifted, the Security Council intends to
keep the long-term surveillance in place, but inspectors say that
to make that work, they must follow up with site visits when
suspicious new information emerges from the monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   Because Iraq continues to block inspections, the Security
Council has made little effort to define exactly what a
comprehensive review of sanctions would entail.
</P>
<P>
   Suggestions range from a study of the ways that Iraqis have
suffered under the embargo to a renewed look at Iraqi failures to
account for missing Kuwaitis or to return Kuwaiti property stolen
during the Persian Gulf war, a review the United States insists on.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Americans who oppose an indefinite embargo against Iraq may soon
find a new public ally in Denis Halliday, who until this week
directed the ``oil for food'' program in Baghdad that allowed the
Iraqis to sell limited amounts of oil to buy civilian goods.
</P>
<P>
   Although Halliday, an Irish expert on development, was able to
broaden considerably the aid Iraqis received, he became an opponent
of sanctions during his tenure in Baghdad. He not only resigned his
position there but also left the United Nations, and he is being
sought as a speaker and for congressional testimony, diplomats said
here.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the United Nations announced the name of his
replacement, Hans von Sponeck of Germany, a former official of the
United Nations Development Program.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqis charge that the United States wants to keep sanctions
indefinitely, not only to cripple the country economically but also
to use arms inspections for intelligence purposes.

CALIFORNIA GUBERNATORIAL RACE FAILS TO ENERGIZE VOTERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Will it be scandal or substance or something else
entirely?
</P>
<P>
   Like politicians across the country, the candidates for the
biggest prize nationally in next month's elections _ the
governorship of California _ are struggling to find the key to
voters' fealty in what one local analyst called ``this squirrely
election year.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Dan Lungren, California's attorney general, and
Democrat Gray Davis, the lieutenant governor, are fencing warily
over what President Clinton's sexual escapade means to voters. The
answer may bear on which candidate wins the top job in the nation's
most populous state after 16 years of Republican rule.
</P>
<P>
   When Lungren sought, not too subtly, to make character the
campaign's central issue, Davis hit back using an opening statement
in a debate last week to tie ``character'' to his opponent's
conservative voting record when he was in the U.S. House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of character does it take to vote against Head
Start, to vote against school lunches?'' Davis demanded. ``When you
apply the character test, you had better be able to pass the
character test.''
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, as the state Republican convention followed
Lungren's example and called on Clinton to resign, California's
Democratic chairman, Art Torres, tweaked the GOP: ``They can hide
as long as they want behind the skirts of Monica Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts predict the skirmishing will have little to do
with the outcome Nov. 3 and will be overtaken in the next five
weeks by what are generally seen as the two major homegrown issues:
crime and education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The character issue is not one that strikes a responsive
chord,'' said Mark Baldasarre, director of the Public Policy
Institute of California in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   And still other observers of the California political scene said
voters have yet to be moved by any issue, be it sex or schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (the race) is being driven at all. It's sort of
poking along in a parallel universe,'' said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe of
the Claremont Graduate School. ``Not an issue that either one of
these guys has raised has any traction.''
</P>
<P>
   That means, Jeffe said, the race may be ``party driven,'' with
reliable Democratic and Republican partisans being most likely to
go to the polls and both sides putting heavy emphasis in the final
days on turning out their base vote.
</P>
<P>
   Each side sees the jockeying for position on Clinton's troubles,
local issues and voter mobilization as critical because the race
apparently is so tight. The latest Los Angeles Times poll found
Lungren and Davis locked in a tie, 46-46 percent, among the most
likely voters.
</P>
<P>
   Although Davis is a center-left Democrat who was once chief of
staff to Gov. Edmund G. ``Jerry'' Brown Jr., and Lungren is a
staunch conservative drawn to politics by another former governor,
Ronald Reagan, voters seem not to have a fixed view of either man
or why one might be a better governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both candidates are still trying to define themselves as
different from each other,'' Baldasarre said.
</P>
<P>
   In such a tight, unfocused race, all the elements _ a national
scandal, the local issues and turnout drives _ can remain pivotal
until Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Cain, a University of California at Berkeley political
scientist, predicted the victor will be ``the candidate who's able
to define the most important issue ..., put the frame on the
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Who that will be is still unclear, Cain said: ``We're just now
getting to the critical negative campaign'' in which Davis and
Lungren are beginning to batter each other with multimillion-dollar
television ad campaigns. The ads are critical because California's
main television stations pay so little attention to the campaign.
Last week's debate, for instance, was not shown live by the major
network channels in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Davis emphasizes Lungren's opposition to abortion,
differentiating him from the Republican incumbent, Gov. Pete
Wilson, one of his party's most outspoken advocates of abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren, who has questioned Davis' dedication to the death
penalty, is currently airing an ad that disputes Davis' contention
he helped to pass the state's ``three strikes'' law, which mandates
a life sentence for anyone after a third felony conviction.
</P>
<P>
   But some advisers on each side believe the candidates cannot
escape the influence of Clinton's troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dominant issues are crime and education, but everything is
overlaid by what happens in Washington,'' said Steve Merksamer, a
Sacramento attorney and veteran Republican strategist who is an
informal adviser to Lungren. ``It all comes down to integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior California Democratic figure said Lungren would be
foolish not to handle Clinton's situation with ``kid gloves.'' But
that view was not enough to keep Davis from Clinton's side when the
president was in Los Angeles on Saturday night to help raise funds
for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren mildly rebuked Davis' reliance on Clinton to help raise
the millions needed for the broadcast war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think example is far more important than money in politics
right now,'' Lungren said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, while calling the president's conduct with Lewinsky
``indefensible,'' contended it was a problem ``about 3,000 miles
away'' from Golden State voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want someone to focus in California,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   But getting voters to focus at all may be the biggest test for
both candidates.
</P>

BROADWAY'S RURAL REFUGE, WITH LUNT AND FONTANNE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENESEE DEPOT, Wis. _ The seven sheets of undated stationery
from a Toronto hotel are addressed to ``Beloved Celestials'' and
folded carefully into a similarly yellowing envelope bearing the
hotel's crest. It was lonely and late at night, the letter said,
after a grueling performance, and Canada was asleep. ``God, how
glorious to be even thinking of seeing you,'' it said, and was
signed ``Larry.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Olivier's wife at the time, Vivien Leigh, added a short
postscript, dark blue ink in a delicate hand, attaching a photo of
the couple with the Queen Mother.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, one of hundreds from Noel Coward, Helen Hayes,
Rudolf Bing, Garson Kanin _ indeed, most of the luminaries of the
world stage between the Roaring Twenties and the Swinging Sixties _
was found stacked in a desk drawer in a small library at Ten
Chimneys, the legendary and utterly peculiar summer retreat of
Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, the reigning couple of the American
theater.
</P>
<P>
   For 30 years, they never accepted a play unless it contained
substantial parts for both of them, and they almost never worked in
summer, so they could spend it at Ten Chimneys, in the rolling
farmland of southeast Wisconsin. Helen Hayes visited almost every
year, usually for a month. Photographs show Fontanne dyeing Hayes'
hair and the two of them flipping through magazines. Alexander
Woollcott visited; so did Lillian Gish, Sherwood Anderson, S.N.
Berman, Montgomery Clift, Uta Hagen, Julie Harris, Peter Brook.
They are pictured at dinner or drinking brandy or lazing around the
pool.
</P>
<P>
   The Lunts loved to entertain, but only a handful of people at a
time. They ate and played and gardened and swam, and often they
worked. Most of the plays in which the Lunts appeared were written
specifically for them, and much of the work _ including Coward's
``Design for Living'' and Robert E. Sherwood's Pulitzer
Prize-winning ``There Shall Be No Night'' _ was done in the studio,
a 19th-century log cabin from Sweden that Lunt took to Wisconsin in
pieces and reconstructed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They worked on Ten Chimneys for several years, finally
finishing the interior in 1933,'' said Joe Garton, a Madison, Wis.,
restaurateur who bought the property in 1995 and sold it to a
foundation in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the next 60 years,'' he said, ``they didn't replace
anything. The result is that the buildings, the furnishings, the
interiors are largely as they were in 1933. It's like a time
capsule.''
</P>
<P>
   When Garton took over the property, he said, the initial effect
was almost eerie. Lunt had died in 1977 and Fontanne in 1983, but
the property and its contents were untouched. There were treasures
everywhere, from the eclectic furnishings to the vintage
photographs, bits of memorabilia, ornate scraps of whimsy at every
turn. In a kitchen cabinet were some of the original pages from
``Oklahoma!'' On a table, a cigarette box inscribed by Coward. In a
small sitting room was a yellow couch from the office of the
Broadway producer David Belasco that the Lunts told people had been
``the original casting couch.''
</P>
<P>
   The magical aura of the place is heightened by the fanciful
decorations. A prominent New York set designer of the 1920s visited
to paint a mural for the Lunts and ended up staying more than two
years, covering the walls, ceilings, stairwells and bathrooms with
a wild assortment of theatrical scenes. The dominant motif is
Scandinavian, drawn from Lunt's ethnic heritage, but this is mixed
with French, Dutch, Russian and other themes.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere Lunt traveled, he bought items for Ten Chimneys, then
sent them to Wisconsin with strict instructions about where they
were to go. He was persnickety and a perfectionist, but a puckish
one. The result is a dizzying mishmash of valuable antiques and
pieces made of 1930s plywood, of Sevres china next to bric-a-brac.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't care about the cost,'' Garton said. ``What they
cared about was the theatrical look, the effect that it had.''
</P>
<P>
   Lunt painted some murals himself. Smoke from one mural in the
main parlor, depicting a biblical scene, spirals up over the
molding and onto the ceiling, circling the chandelier. On a curved
staircase, a powdered and wigged fop points the way around the
corner and toward the dining room, where 12 chairs with needlepoint
seats by Fontanne, Hayes and Lunt's sister bear the signs of the
zodiac. Two angels in one scene are marked ``A.L.'' and ``L.F.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ten Chimneys Foundation hopes to restore the property,
maintain and catalog its bizarre collections and eventually open it
to the public. The goal is to also turn Ten Chimneys into a working
center, a site for master classes, seminars, actors' retreats,
small-scale productions and other intellectual and artistic
endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Lunt was born into a wealthy Milwaukee lumber family that
owned substantial chunks of Wisconsin, including the tract that
eventually became Ten Chimneys. His father died when he was 2, and
at 21 Lunt came into a significant fortune. But he loved acting,
and studied at the Emerson Institute for Oratory in Boston before
moving to New York and falling in with a crowd of struggling
performers that included Coward, Hayes and eventually Fontanne.
</P>
<P>
   Lunt became famous first, an early Broadway heartthrob, but
Fontanne quickly followed. They married in 1922, lived in a town
house near Gracie Mansion and became fixtures of the Broadway
stage, the epitome of high style. They were famous for their
passionate love scenes, which audiences of a tamer era accepted
only because they knew the couple were married.
</P>
<P>
   Hungry for a place to escape the city and nostalgic about his
Wisconsin youth, Lunt decided to build a summer retreat there. With
the help of architects and others, he designed the entire Ten
Chimneys compound; a main house, a cottage for his mother, a pool
and pool house, a barn and a dairy.
</P>
<P>
   The imported log cabin was put near the pool and became their
studio. The couple would retreat to the studio after dinner for
songs and games and brandies. During the day, it was where they
went to work on scenes or to kick around ideas.
</P>
<P>
   It was an odd life at Ten Chimneys, an endless procession of New
York sophisticates playing at being rubes. Every summer the Lunts
allowed a photographer to chronicle their life on the farm for
national magazines in curiously airbrushed and obviously posed
shots of the perfectly coifed couple in crisp, clean clothes
standing next to a horse or bending over a flower bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is too simple for most people,'' Fontanne said in one
interview. ``They would be bored stiff. We are not. We can get
anything, watercress, a butler who is a farm boy _ he has such
style _ and a wonderful laundress. I go 10 miles into Waukesha for
the best hairdo in America.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ten Chimneys had little impact outside the compound, neither
in tiny Genesee Depot nor in the other small nearby villages. The
summer staff consisted of high school students drilled by Lunt on
the proper way to serve soup and wear evening clothes. And except
for Helen Hayes, who attended Sunday Mass nearby, most visitors
rarely left the compound. ``It was a little world unto itself,''
Garton said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, the Lunts sold their Manhattan town house and moved to
Ten Chimneys to live year round. In his final years, Lunt was going
blind, and after his death Fontanne rarely left the area. A trip to
Washington to receive the Kennedy Center Honors was a rare outing.
</P>
<P>
   The Lunts had no children, so the property passed to a more
distant relative, and a deal was struck with a developer who wanted
to auction the furnishings and memorabilia and build condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   Garton, who had visited the property a few years earlier, wanted
it to remain intact. When the developer's option on the property
expired, Garton bought it in 1997 for $1 million, contents
included.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never intended to live there,'' he said. ``My intention at
the time was to be an interim caretaker or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Money was raised for a historical site analysis in 1997, and
substantial repairs were recommended. Garton sold the property to
the new foundation early this year for what he had paid and, with
the help of contributions from theatrical figures like Julie Harris
and Rocco Landesman as well as the state of Wisconsin and local
foundations, began a three-phase program to resuscitate the
property.
</P>
<P>
   The first major capital improvement in more than three decades
(about $150,000 for new roofs) was completed this summer. Already,
Garton said, about $1 million has been raised for subsequent work,
which will include additional structural repairs, $2.3 million to
restore and preserve the furnishings and decorative objects,
construction of a visitors' center and transformation of a decrepit
garage into a gallery and lecture hall. The total expected cost:
$5.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   A major capital campaign will be started in 1999 with the idea
of opening the site to the public in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slowly, the word is spreading to theatrical people of what
we're trying to do, and there is a lot of interest, I think,'' he
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Garton made his way happily through the labyrinth of rooms in
the main house, steps leading up and down into the theatrical
spaces fanning out from a central space that the Lunts called ``the
flirtation room.'' He pointed out bits of whimsy in the frescoes,
opened drawers, stroked the white piano where Coward once sang
ditties before dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Garton picked through a stack of aging letters until he came
across a copy of one that Fontanne apparently sent in 1937 to a
Miss Felzo who wanted to be an actress.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you please come backstage after the performance Tuesday
night, that is about 11, I will be glad to have you read for me on
the stage,'' Fontanne wrote. ``I have found it most satisfying if
the scene chosen is not from Shakespeare nor a highly dramatic or
emotional scene. A simple scene is so much more difficult to do and
naturalness is so essential in the theater today. Don't be
frightened or nervous. I've been through all this myself in the
past and know just how difficult and horrible an ordeal it can be.
Good luck.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no record of whether Miss Felzo appeared, which scene
she chose or whatever became of her.

COUNTERFEITERS SEIZE ON NEW $20 BILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RUSS WILES  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - A stranger on the street asks if you can break a $20
bill.
</P>
<P>
   A shopper at your yard sale wants to buy a few knickknacks with
a $50 bill.
</P>
<P>
   A caller responding to your classified ad offers a $100 note for
the concert tickets you're selling.
</P>
<P>
   A harried grocery clerk hands you a wad of greenbacks after you
swipe your debit card through the ATM machine at the counter.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunities for getting stuck with counterfeit currency
always have been as great as the number of times you handle cash in
a day. But with the government's introduction last week of
redesigned $20 bills _ the denomination that's most often faked _
the risk is greater now than it has been.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the redesigned greenbacks include several features
intended to thwart crooks, including hard-to-duplicate watermarks
and ink that shifts colors depending on the angle of viewing. But
until people get used to those new features, they will be
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``That plays right into the hands of the counterfeiter and makes
it easier for him to pass a note,'' said Kirby Hutchison, a
recently retired Secret Service agent who heads his own Scottsdale,
Ariz.-based investigations firm.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the government came out with the new $20 bills, and
also new-look $50 and $100 notes in the past two years,
counterfeiting had been on an upswing. The amount of fake money
passed to the public has tripled in the past 10 years, said James
Lukash, who recently retired from the Secret Service after heading
the agency's Arizona-New Mexico division.
</P>
<P>
   ``At any time, there's about $300 million in counterfeit U.S.
currency in circulation, including overseas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service is the federal agency entrusted with
thwarting counterfeiters. It was established near the end of the
Civil War, at a time when paper money was just coming into
circulation and was being fabricated on a wide scale. The agency's
role in protecting presidents didn't begin until after President
William McKinley was assassinated in 1901.
</P>
<P>
   Lukash and Hutchison recently produced a 15-minute videotape
that instructs businesses on how to recognize counterfeit money
while offering tips for dealing with suspected crooks at the point
of sale. They anticipate solid demand for their product given the
steady rise in counterfeiting and the changing nature of this
illicit business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem will get worse before it gets better,'' Hutchison
said. ``That's because office machines, copiers and printers are
getting better and cheaper.''
</P>
<P>
   The old stereotype of counterfeiters as artisans using printing
presses is fast becoming obsolete. Practically anyone with a
personal computer, scanner, color copier and inkjet printer can get
started. Would-be crooks don't even have to own these items to set
up shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people come in after hours and use the equipment at work,
which is generally of a better quality than what they have at
home,'' Hutchison said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the sturdy cotton-linen paper used in U.S. currency can be
purchased at stationery stores, Hutchison said.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix area is an active area for counterfeiting, partly
because of its proximity to Mexico. Many fake bills are made
abroad, then smuggled into this country, Hutchison said. But he
said all big American cities have become fertile grounds for
counterfeiting, regardless of proximity to the border.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix area's s tight job market may be contributing to the
counterfeit problem, Lukash says. That's because strong growth and
rapid employee turnover creates a situation in which many retail
clerks are put on the job without adequate training in detecting
fake bills or dealing with suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many employers are just grateful that they've found someone to
stand in front of the cash register,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Michelle Ahlmer, executive director of the Arizona Retailers
Association in Mesa, said merchants are interested in their
employees becoming familiar with the new currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even a clerk who's been on the job 20 years will need to
recognize what's counterfeit and what's real (with the new $20
bills),'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Most counterfeit money is passed at everyday retail
establishments _ gas stations, minimarts, department stores and
supermarkets. That means innocent consumers are at risk of having
fake bills handed to them moments later in change.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, it's important for everyone to be able to spot the new
anti-fraud traits that have been included in the redesigned
currency. These include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Larger portraits. Enhanced pictures of the U.S. statesmen
slightly off the center of the redesigned bills make it easier to
see the intricate facial details that are characteristic of genuine
bills.
</P>
<P>
   _ Color-shifting ink. If you examine the lower right corner of
the currency from different angles, the ink varies between green
and black.
</P>
<P>
   - Watermarks. Holding up the new bills to a light will reveal
the image of the same statesman depicted in the portrait.
</P>
<P>
   - Polyester security threads. These thin vertical strips feature
tiny, hard-to-duplicate lettering.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, one of the best security features hasn't been
changed. It's the tiny red and blue nylon fibers that have been
imbedded in the cotton-linen paper. These fibers are a detail that
counterfeiters can't easily duplicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the public would look at nothing else than that, they would
detect more than 90 percent of counterfeit bills,`` Hutchison said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the new bills will bemuse and perhaps befuddle
some people until they become accustomed to the redesign.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison tells of a woman who called last year to report her
suspicion that counterfeiters were operating at Arizona State
University. The woman noticed that the security threads on a
redesigned $100 bill featured type reading, ``ASU ASU ASU.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison instructed her to turn the money over and take another
look at the lettering.

   Counterfeit money generally can be identified fairly easily.
Here are some telltale signs cited by former Secret Service agents
James Lukash and Kirby Hutchison that can be applied to all U.S.
currency:
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Portraits. The eyes and facial features in genuine bills are
lifelike and three-dimensional.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Seals. The pointed edges around the round Treasury seal
aren't easy to duplicate.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Serial numbers. Sometimes they aren't aligned in fake money.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Color. Counterfeiters sometimes use ink that's too light.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Lettering. The letters and images in genuine currency are
slightly raised, in contrast to the flat feel of money that has
been copied. &QL;

COMMENTARY: THE PIPER AND THE TUNE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ One political force is more determined than any other
to drive President Clinton from office for his behavior, and the
same force would be the big political gainer if he is removed. That
is the Christian right.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Drew, writing in The Washington Post last week, said
that the president ``will be impeached.'' One reason, she said, is
that ``the ever-stronger Republican base, the Christian right,
demands that it happen, and few Republicans will risk crossing
them. This is more important to most Republicans than the
president's job approval ratings.''
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment needs only a simple majority in the House.
Conviction in the Senate, requiring a two-thirds vote, is much less
likely. But even impeachment _ the course on which House
Republicans seem to be set _ would have enormous consequences for
our politics.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition and other religious conservatives would
become still more influential in the Republican Party. In recent
years they have had a disproportionate voice in the writing of the
party platform and in presidential primaries. In the year 2000 they
might well control the choice of the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, the centrist governor of Texas whom many regard
as the front-runner for 2000, said the other day that seeing
Washington in its uproar over Monica Lewinsky made him wonder about
running for president. In any event, he could have trouble winning
the nomination in a convention dominated by the right, whatever his
poll numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The shift to the right would be just as consequential in
congressional policy terms. The social issues that mean so much to
religious conservatives _ the issues that President Reagan pushed
aside to concentrate on economic policy _ would come to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion would be targeted for a range of new restrictions,
including even a constitutional amendment to outlaw it. And concern
with sexual matters would not be likely to stop there. There would
be legislation to limit U.S. help for population control efforts
around the world. Federal regulations to give equal treatment to
homosexuals would be another target. The law forbidding grants to
``indecent'' art could be expanded to other fields.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal law is another possible area for punitive moralism.
House Republicans have already acted under cover of the Lewinsky
turmoil to try to sneak a harsh new measure on juvenile crime onto
the statute books. They have attached to a noncontroversial bill a
rider requiring the states, among other things, to put more
children in prison with adult criminals.
</P>
<P>
   If you think about all those things, it is clear that there is
an effort under way to bring about a fundamental change in the
political direction of this country, effectively changing the
results of our last two national elections. It would be a coup
d'etat.
</P>
<P>
   Long before Linda Tripp gave her tapes to Kenneth Starr, there
really was a right-wing conspiracy of sorts to bring down this
president. Richard Mellon Scaife gave The American Spectator
millions for its Arkansas Project to find dirt on Bill Clinton.
Crazies spread tales that he was involved in murder and
drug-smuggling. Conservative groups financed Paula Jones' lawsuit
against the president. (Her lawyers hired as investigators members
of a Texas church that tried to remove ``Moby Dick'' and ``To Kill
A Mockingbird'' from the local high school reading list.)
</P>
<P>
   It was President Clinton's arrogant folly that opened the way
for the religious right and others long frustrated in their desire
to destroy him. And they are dead serious in their determination to
exploit the opportunity he gave them.
</P>
<P>
   The outside world looks with astonishment at what is happening
here. A columnist of The Financial Times of London, Philip Stevens,
put it: ``As the days pass, the proposition that the most powerful
nation on earth could sacrifice its leader to lies about his sex
life becomes ever more eccentric.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans who do not agree with the religious right _ who
want this to remain an open and tolerant society _ are unhappy
about President Clinton's conduct. But as we consider how to deal
with it, we have to be aware of the political consequences.

 &HT;    In New Orleans, the water is high, but tourists are mostly sober
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Here's something you don't normally hear on
Bourbon Street: ``I'm sober.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, as Hurricane Georges barely skirted New Orleans
but lashed it with high winds and spitting rain, being sober was a
common complaint. Tourists, trapped in the city by closed highways
and canceled flights, wandered the empty streets looking for food
and, more importantly, booze.
</P>
<P>
   They resembled panhandlers, dressed in plastic garbage bags to
ward off the rain and asking desperately if anyone knew of an open
bar or somewhere to get some lunch.
</P>
<P>
   A trio from Chicago huddled under a ripped awning on Bourbon
Street, drinking tall-boy beers and debating how best to find an
open restaurant. They had been living on pretzels and peanuts, and
the diet was getting old.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried everything short of hitchhiking to get out,'' said
Michelle Davister. ``But I have to admit, we're having a blast.''
</P>
<P>
   Although spared the direct hit feared over the weekend as
Georges churned in the Gulf of Mexico, New Orleans still felt the
hurricane's force Monday. Lake Pontchartrain overflowed its banks,
flooding a major highway and destroying the historic seafood
restaurant Brunings.
</P>
<P>
   Two deaths in Louisiana have been attributed to the storm, and
Florissant, a small town south of New Orleans, was flooded with
nine feet of water when a levee along the Mississippi Rover broke.
No one was hurt there; everyone had evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   More than 180,000 people were without power in the New Orleans
area. A curfew, imposed Sunday night, remained in effect all day
Monday in New Orleans. Mayor Marc Morial would not allow anyone to
leave the city's nine shelters, even though the 13,000 people stuck
at the Superdome got such a case of cabin fever that they
threatened to create a stampede and burst through the doors.
</P>
<P>
   Enough bars and stores in the French Quarter stayed open to
tempt tourists outside, even though police cars periodically rolled
by, loudspeakers blaring: ``The mandatory evacuation is still in
effect!''
</P>
<P>
   But much was missing from the Quarter: There were no horse-drawn
carriages at Jackson Square, no palm readers, no portrait artists,
no Lucky Dog hot dog carts, no musicians, no kids with bottle caps
tapped into their sneakers doing dances for pocket change. Cafe Du
Monde was closed, as were Antoine's, Galatoire's and practically
every other restaurant in town.
</P>
<P>
   The boarded-up bars and stores and the empty streets made what
is normally a relentlessly lively town seem almost dead. A wind
howled up the Mississippi River all day, and plastic beer cups
clattered up the deserted streets.
</P>
<P>
   David Miller stood under the awning of the historic Monteleone
Hotel, watching the rain and trying to cheer up girlfriend Tonya
Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were here to catch a cruise, but it got messed up,'' said
Miller, who is from Dallas. His chief complaint was that the food
at the hotel seemed to be getting scarce. ``It's getting
trashier,'' he said. ``You don't see steaks and baked potatoes
anymore. It's a lot of thrown-together stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourists hoped to get out of town today, and locals, who
evacuated in record numbers over the weekend, are likely to clog
the highways heading the other way _ back home.

 &HT;    Coke keeping cool over Pepsi One
 &HT;    By Mickey H. Gramig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As Pepsico gears up to launch what's being called the
first innovation in the U.S. diet soft drink arena in more than 16
years, it's business as usual at Coca-Cola Co.
</P>
<P>
   There won't be an increase in Diet Coke advertising or marketing
to counter the expected media blitz when Pepsi One, Pepsi's new
one-calorie cola, makes its nationwide debut the week of Oct. 17.
Actor Cuba ``Show Me the Money'' Gooding will serve as the brand's
celebrity pitchman.
</P>
<P>
   And certainly don't expect Diet Coke's formula to switch to the
same sweetener mix as Pepsi One, which owes its ``non-diet'' taste
to a blend of aspartame and Ace-K, also known as acesulfame
potassium. The Food and Drug Administration in July approved Ace-K
for use in beverages, and Pepsico has been hustling to crank out
the first U.S. soft drink flavored with the artificial sweetener.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pepsi's doing what it needs to do. We focus on our brands and
what we need to do,'' said Frank P. Bifulco Jr., vice president of
marketing for Coca-Cola USA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We market brands _ not ingredients,'' Bifulco added. ``You'll
never see us coming out with a brand touting an ingredient.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Coca-Cola is likely testing a diet cola concoction
flavored with its own blend of aspartame and Ace-K, but such
testing is so top secret no one will discuss it.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and industry insiders say if Pepsi One is a
market-share-gaining hit, Coca-Cola has to be ready to roll with a
new diet brand to shift back the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The best guess is the company would add Coca-Cola Light to its
menu of beverages in the U.S. and keep Diet Coke on store shelves.
Coca-Cola Light is an aspartame and Ace-K-sweetened cola successful
in 46 overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, we are poised to do what we need to do to keep Diet
Coke healthy and growing,'' said Bifulco, who is charged with brand
positioning and strategy for all of Coca-Cola's U.S. soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be very careful. We're keeping our options
open,'' he said. ``We don't want to do anything to alienate the
huge core of consumers that are loyal to Diet Coke.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, since Diet Coke's July 1982 introduction, it has sold
nearly 10 billion cases in the U.S., where it ranks as the
third-largest selling soft drink brand behind Coca-Cola and Pepsi.
Together with caffeine-free Diet Coke, Diet Coke has a 45.1 percent
share of the diet soft drink market, compared with Diet Pepsi and
caffeine-free Diet Pepsi's combined 28.1 percent share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers will try Pepsi One because it's new. This could be
their big winner,'' said Tom Pirko, a New York-based beverage
consultant who thinks Pepsi One's taste will hit a bull's-eye with
consumers. ``Coca-Cola has to be ready to defend that shot,
assuming Pepsi can get its aim right.''
</P>
<P>
   Others aren't so certain. Sure, any new product will get trial
usage, but will consumers switch brands?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'll know for probably a year or two whether
this product is a success,'' said John Sicher, publisher of
Beverage Digest, a trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   Pirko thinks Pepsi One will be such a hit that Pepsico will pull
Diet Pepsi off the market, even though the company says that's not
the plan. Pepsico's rationale is a lesson learned from the famous
New Coke debacle more than a decade ago: No use in alienating Diet
Pepsi fans who may not like the sweeter taste of Pepsi One.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Marineau, president and chief executive of Pepsico's
Pepsi-Cola Co., said Gooding's signing as spokesman for the $50
million Pepsi One campaign will give the launch an added push. The
ads, with the theme ``Only One has it all,'' were created by New
York-based BBDO Worldwide. Diet Coke, meanwhile, is sticking to its
marketing plan, which focuses on the one-calorie drink's
``refreshing unique cola taste'' that ``empowers people to look and
feel their best.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about living life to the fullest,'' Bifulco said.
``Consumers are not giving up anything but calories.''
</P>
<P>
   As it has in years past, Diet Coke will be featured in
Coca-Cola's holiday marketing plans, but its next big media splash
won't begin until January.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the company will kick off a soft drink first:
Including lengthy excerpts from just-released and
soon-to-be-released novels inside specially marked multi-can
packages of Diet Coke.
</P>
<P>
   The promotion, which involves leading authors and major U.S.
publishing houses, is designed to capture the interest of Diet
Coke's core consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We market with the consumer in mind,'' Bifulco said.

 &HT;    Panhandle fares well as Georges fury unleashes elsewhere
 &HT;    By Mike Williams and Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENSACOLA, Fla. _ One storm-related death was reported and
marinas and docks were lost on Pensacola Beach, but the Florida
Panhandle escaped the brunt of Hurricane Georges wind and rain.
</P>
<P>
   For a time Monday, a portion of I-10 near the Alabama line was
under water, as more than 20 inches of rain were recorded in the
Panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   Creeks were overflowing their banks and officials were worried
that rivers in the western Panhandle would begin flooding in the
next several days.
</P>
<P>
   Gulf Power Co. crews worked to restore electrical service to
90,000 homes and businesses in Escambia, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa
counties. Most schools and government offices were closed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Georges was the second storm in three weeks to cause relatively
modest damage to the area. Hurricane Earl brought category 1, 80
mph winds to Panama City Beach Sept. 3 before shattering into a
tropical storm shortly after landfall.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Earl nor George appeared to have caused nearly the
damage brought by the back-to-back hurricanes of Erin and Opal
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday afternoon, the Pensacola area began to return to
normal, as winds subsided but the steady rain continued.
</P>
<P>
   The Pensacola Bay Bridge _ linking the mainland with Gulf Breeze
_ opened in the afternoon. The Bob Sikes Bridge, connecting Gulf
Breeze with the beaches, was opened till early evening for
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Some low-lying streets in downtown Pensacola flooded after more
than 15 inches of rain fell and another 10 inches could come today,
said Suzanne Kahn, spokeswoman for the Escambia County Emergency
Operations Center.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn said the dunes were breached in some spots.
</P>
<P>
   A tornado-like waterspout Monday came ashore near Panama City
Beach, nearly 200 miles east of Pensacola, and destroyed five homes
and damaged seven, but no one was injured, said Bay County
spokesman Charles Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   A fire late Sunday took the life of a Pensacola woman in the
midst of heavy rain and tropical storm-force winds. Pensacola
police said the woman, Ruby Lee Pittiway, 66, is believed to have
been lighting a candle when her house caught fire. There was no
power at the time because of Georges.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Pensacola, the roof of a downtown building caved in
while three other structures suffered lesser damage, including
broken windows at McGuire's Irish Pub, one of the city's best-known
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   National Guard troops worked Sunday night and early Monday, at
the storm's height, to rescue more than 200 people stranded in
their homes by flash floods.

 &HT;    Web marketing agency iXL expands
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta-based iXL extended its ever-growing reach
Monday, buying two Web companies in Boston and one in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   iXL Boston will be based in Cambridge, Mass., and headed by
Niraj Shah, 25, who co-founded the acquired company, Spinners, in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Janer, former head of Larry Miller Productions, is iXL
Boston's executive vice president. Each company had 35 employees.
</P>
<P>
   With the purchase of Tekna, iXL added a Richmond office. The new
branch employs fewer than 40 people.
</P>
<P>
   The latest acquisition is iXL's 30th since opening in April
1996. The rapid growth shot the interactive Web-based advertising
and marketing agency from 19th in 1997 to first place this year in
AdWeek's rankings of Top 50 U.S. Interactive Advertising Agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of Monday's deals were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Rocco, iXL vice chairman, said the company is changing its
business structure, adding the ability to offer electronic
commerce, database and Web site hosting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spinners is the anchor,'' Rocco said. ``We go into a city
needing a strong technology base. That's what separates us. Other
than that, we're just making pretty pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a no-brainer. I wish I was telling you this was brain
surgery,'' he said. ``But a lot of this is Business 101.''
</P>
<P>
   Among its online database projects, Spinners developed the
software that lets customers of The New York Times e-mail service
complaints. Other clients include Chase Manhattan and Merrill
Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Miller Productions started in 1979, developing multimedia
slide shows and promotional material to introduce products. Now,
about 65 percent of the $5 million business is Internet-related,
including the Web site for Ked's sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   Tekna gives iXL its first Mid-Atlantic presence. Tekna took in
about $3 million in 1997. The company specializes in Internet and
multimedia products. Customers include General Electric and the
Virginia State Lottery.
</P>
<P>
   iXL now has full-service offices in Atlanta, Charlotte, London,
Los Angeles, Memphis, San Francisco, New York, Denver and the
District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The company said announcements of more acquisitions should come
later this week.

MARKET PLACE: SEC CRACKDOWN ON TECHNOLOGY WRITE-OFFS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is upgrade time at America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the noise about its new 4.0 browser software version.
The Securities and Exchange Commission has ordered the online
service, and the rest of the technology industry, to improve the
way they account for mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is how technology companies have seized on a footnote
in the accounting rules related to research expenses to write off
most of the purchase price of companies as soon as they acquire
them. This prevents a continuing drag on profits that would result
from writing off the purchase price over several years.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC's move comes as it is cracking down on a number of
accounting practices it finds abusive. In comments at New York
University, Arthur Levit Jr., the chairman of the commission, said
his staff would immediately increase its scrutiny of companies that
use certain aggressive accounting techniques to inflate their
quarterly earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing to make an example of America Online, the biggest
Internet company, the commission took the extreme step of blocking
it from publishing its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings for nearly
two months.
</P>
<P>
   America Online finally reached an agreement with the SEC and
published its earnings Monday. It wrote off $70.5 million related
to research at two companies it acquired, representing 22 percent
of the $316 million it had paid for them. Previously the company
had said it planned to write off a vast majority of the purchase
price, though it gave no specific figures.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Lynn Turner, the SEC's chief accountant, called on
the accounting industry to tighten its rules related to writing off
the cost of research. In a letter to the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants, he said that a study by the SEC had
found ``significant problems in the recognition and valuation'' of
the research write-offs.
</P>
<P>
   The letter outlined a proposed standard for such write-offs that
is much stricter than accountants have been using. And the
commission threatened to make companies take the embarrassing step
of restating their published earnings reports in cases where it
deems their research write-offs to be ``materially misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that the change could inhibit acquisitions,
especially by smaller technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has more significance for other companies besides AOL,''
said Keith Benjamin, an analyst at BancAmerica Robertson Stephens.
``You will see more young Internet companies forced to take lower
write-offs.'' America Online is less affected, he said, because it
has become big enough to absorb the additional charges.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is how companies account for the value of ``in-process
research and development'' _ research that has yet to be turned
into a marketable product _ at companies they buy. In an
acquisition, companies estimate the value of all of the assets they
are buying, both tangible ones like buildings and intangible assets
like brand names and customer lists. If the purchase price is
higher than the value of all of these assets _ and it usually is _
the remainder is added to a catch-all item known as good will.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are forced to write off the value of all of these
assets over a period of from 3-40 years, depending on the useful
life of the asset. The one exception is in-process research, which
is written off immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Since technology companies are especially interested in showing
investors accelerating earnings growth, many have started
attributing the bulk of their acquisition costs to in-process
research.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC letter listed a number of what it described as
``abuses'' in this practice. In one case, for example, a company
that the commission did not name wrote off nearly all the purchase
price of an acquisition as in-process research, even though the
target company had not spent a significant amount money on research
or development.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a company didn't spend significant amounts on R&AMP;D, it would
raise questions in my mind,'' said Baruch Lev, a professor of
accounting at New York University. He conducted a study of 400
acquisitions, mostly of technology companies, and found that the
buyers wrote off 75 percent of the purchase price as in-process
research.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   America Online said that it would not be deterred from buying
more companies because of the change in rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we look at acquisitions we will look for those that have
the right strategic value and the right economic value,'' said J.
Michael Kelly, the company's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Because the allowed write-off was less than analysts had
expected, America Online posted an unexpected profit for its fourth
quarter. It earned $7.1 million, or 3 cents a fully diluted share.
That compares with a loss of $11.8 million, or 6 cents a fully
diluted share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   America Online said it would write off the rest of the cost of
its acquisitions over 5-10 years. That will mean a deduction of
between $25 million and $50 million a year from its reported
profits. The company told analysts Monday that its core business
continued to do better than expected and that as a result, it
predicted it would meet their previous earnings estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of America Online increased $2.375 each Monday, to
$117.125.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Cohen, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, said that the
market was not concerned with the deductions from profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reported earnings is one small piece of a larger picture at
technology companies that includes revenue growth, market position,
audience size and brand equity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even if investors are ignoring the good will charges now,
Jack Ciesielski, a money manager and the publisher of the Analyst's
Accounting Observer, argues that it provides a useful reminder of
how much companies are spending on acquisitions, especially if the
good times end.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a big blob of good will and they aren't earning a
return on it, investors can see it and start asking questions,''
Ciesielski said. ``If you have an immediate write off, the trail is
destroyed.''

TO ACTRESSES, GREEK TRAGEDY OFFERS MANY HAPPY ENDINGS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pat Carroll was attracted to the role of the Chorus of Mycenae
in Sophocles' ``Electra'' because of its spareness, its necessity,
its raw and relentless candor. ``There is no subtext,'' Ms. Carroll
said. ``What is said is what is meant.''
</P>
<P>
   She was also grateful for the part, period, because she is 71,
and there are few female roles of comparable force for women her
age. ``That's another reason why, over the past 12 years I have
done nothing but classical work,'' Ms. Carroll said. ``You aren't
categorized into an age category. You are free to be any age you
want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carroll is one of many women who are taking the stage this
season in leading roles in Greek tragedies. The sheer number of
productions is remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   Through Sunday, the McCarter Theater in Princeton, N.J., is
presenting Sophocles' ``Electra,'' featuring Zoe Wanamaker in the
title role, Claire Bloom as Clytemnestra and Ms. Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   At the Classic Stage Company in the East Village, the Blue Light
Theater Company is staging ``Oedipus,'' a new play written and
directed by Dare Clubb, featuring Billy Crudup in the title role
and Frances McDormand as Merope. It runs through Oct. 25.
</P>
<P>
   The National Theater of Greece has just presented six
performances of ``Medea'' at City Center in Greek with English
translation, with the actress Karyofyllia Karabeti in the title
role. And from Oct. 14 through Oct. 18, the New Wave Festival at
the Brooklyn Academy of Music will feature ``The World Mysteries:
The Mysteries of Eleusis,'' a play by Vasilios Calitsis and Tasos
Roussos based on the myth of Demeter and Persephone.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays by Euripides have been combined as ``The Iphigenia
Cycle,'' which is to begin performances in January at the Theater
for a New Audience with JoAnne Akalaitis as director. And The
Williamstown Theater Festival in Williamstown, Mass., recently
presented Euripides' ``Hecuba,'' starring Olympia Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   Why the sudden deluge of Greek drama? Some of the artists
involved in those productions say they were attracted by the plays'
emotional energy. And a number of them cite the nation's political
climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real meaning of classicism is necessity and urgency,''
said David Leveaux, who is directing ``Electra.'' ``We obviously
live in necessary and urgent times; therefore we're looking for
drama that will match that.''
</P>
<P>
   Timberlake Wertenbaker, who translated and adapted the
``Hecuba'' recently produced at Williamstown, said: ``Playwrights
at the time, particularly Euripides and Sophocles, were totally
disenchanted with the political system. I think that when that
happens _ and we may be in a similar period now _ people tend to
turn toward women not because women behave better than men but
because they're more truthful about what they do and why they do
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think playwrights were turning to these women characters to
try to understand something, to try to find passion against
hypocrisy and double talk,'' Ms. Wertenbaker added. ``They didn't
look down on women and didn't give them stupid small roles. The
great flaw of modern plays is they always try to make women nice.
These women are terrible, and they have the courage of their
horror.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the brazenness and potency of the women in ``Electra,''
in which Electra avenges her father's murder by her mother,
Clytemnestra, was the main reason Leveaux said he decided to direct
the play. ``It's unusual to find a play that pits that number of
ferociously powerful women against each other,'' he said. ``You can
see in characters like Electra and Clytemnestra the antecedents of
other great female roles in later Western drama, from Hedda Gabler
to Lady Macbeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``These elemental women appear in this play compressed and
utterly uncompromising,'' Leveaux continued. ``There is no time for
the walk to the mantelpiece, so what you get is pure argument.''
</P>
<P>
   The actresses involved said they were grateful for roles in
which they could be direct and assertive rather than resort to
stereotypical machinations and manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You absolutely have to find the cleanest possible way of
delivering the greatest truths,'' said Ms. Bloom, who plays
Clytemnestra in ``Electra.'' ``So that we can't really bring
post-Freudian analysis, as one brings to most other plays.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Anne Dudek, a 23-year-old actress fresh out of Northwestern
University who plays the title character in ``The Iphigenia
Cycle,'' said she loves Iphigenia's combination of defiance and
surrender. In the first play of the cycle, ``Iphigenia at Aulis,''
Iphigenia agrees to die at her father's hand for the sake of the
war. In the second, ``Iphigenia in Tauris,'' she is full of
bitterness at having been sacrificed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The core of the first play is this intense longing for life,
which dictates all the decisions she makes,'' Ms. Dudek said. By
the end, she added: ``She's this incredibly hardened, saddened
character. But I think the anger comes out of a hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the depth and pitch of their characters, women in
these plays say they find the performances especially taxing. ``By
the end of a six-hour rehearsal session,'' Ms. Carroll said, ``I'm
ready for two weeks in the south of France.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Akalaitis said the material was also draining to direct.
``It's very hard for me to rehearse these plays,'' she said,
``because I actually cry all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether contemporary audiences would go for all this Greek
tragedy did not worry the artists involved. Instead, they focused
on the timeless themes and suspenseful plots. ``It's a thriller,
basically,'' Ms. Wanamaker said of ``Electra.'' ``And it moves like
an express train.''
</P>
<P>
   Niketi Kontouri, who is directing ``Medea,'' described the title
role as a compelling amalgam of universal characteristics that will
resonate with today's audiences. ``She's a witch, she's a
barbarian; but at the same time she uses speech as a man _ she uses
laws,'' Ms. Kontouri said. ``All people may have a hint of Medea in
themselves. All of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is the contradictions of the female characters in
Greek tragedy that actresses playing them seem to appreciate most.
Ms. Wanamaker described Electra, for example, as being ``a fury, a
killer, a luminous heroine, a terrorist and an inconsolable angel''
all at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we can be appalled by her, and we can be moved by her,''
Ms. Wanamaker said, ``but we cannot resist her or the magnificent
humanity that rages within her.''

FASHION NOTES AND NEWS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By CONSTANCE C.R. WHITE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Secondary Line for Jacobs  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Marc Jacobs and his business partner Robert Duffy will soon be
living the endless fashion season. Next year they are planning a
secondary collection for women. The line, which does not yet have a
name, will be developed in cooperation with LVMH Moet
Hennessy-Louis Vuitton, partners in their business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never like to think of it as second,'' Jacobs said. ``Second
sounds so inferior. It will obviously be cheaper.'' The line will
be for spring 2000. Duffy said: ``Our partnership with LVMH makes
this feasible. With LVMH we'll be able to open our own stores,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Jacobs developed a second line, Marc Jacobs Look, with
Gilmar S.p.A., an Italian concern, which produces Sui by Anna Sui.
LVMH bought into Jacobs Enterprises last year, and Look was
discontinued, except in Japan, where it is licensed to Renown Look
and Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
   The new label will have a casual air, Jacobs said. It is meant
for collection customers and for those for whom his $1,000-plus
designs are too expensive. ``If somebody wants a cotton T-shirt,
they want a cotton T-shirt even if they have a cashmere sweater,''
he said. ``As long as things are honest and it's not the `polyester
to look like wool' mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; An Absence in Vogue  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Steven Meisel's couture spread and cover photograph of Oprah
Winfrey for Vogue's October issue are stunning, but so is the
complete absence of any clothes from Givenchy by Alexander McQueen
in the couture layout. It is all the more glaring since Anna
Wintour, the editor in chief, gives a rousing cheer to McQueen in
her editor's letter (she also says that Jean Paul Gaultier should
be given a couture house).
</P>
<P>
   For couture designers, inclusion _ or not _ in the October and
February issues of the major fashion magazines tells them where
they stand in the magazines' estimation. Ms. Wintour said yesterday
that it was a problem with the photographs, rather than any
intentional slight, that kept McQueen out of the feature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We photographed one or two things from the collection, and
unfortunately they came out dark,'' Ms. Wintour said. ``I feel
really badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither McQueen nor Meisel could be reached Monday. Vogue will
try to include Givenchy in its Christmas issue, Ms. Wintour said.
``I've already heard from Alexander,'' she said grimly.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Designer's New Directions  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Mikel Kilgour is an anomaly even in an industry full of
anomalies. A 12-year-old signature shop by an unknown designer is
unusual enough, but one operated by an African-American is even
more so. Since 1986, Kilgour and his wife, Celia Sweet, have run
Kilgour &AMP; Sweet, at 343 Milburn Ave. in Milburn, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Kilgour is closing the store and moving to Los
Angeles, to become the creative director of Dion Scott, a
men's-wear store at 343 Robertson Blvd., owned by Dion Lattimore
and Scott Torrellas.
</P>
<P>
   Why give up such rare success? ``I've been here since I was 21,
and I'm ready for something new,'' Kilgour said. The expiration of
his lease, he said, dovetailed with the offer from Lattimore.
</P>
<P>
   Lattimore counts Magic Johnson as one of his top clients.
Kilgour's arrival at the company marks the expansion of its women's
lines to include Kilgour &AMP; Sweet for Dion Scott. Lisa Leslie, the
basketball star, is an early customer.
</P>
<P>
   Kilgour had previously designed a men's line for Dion Scott.
``One design he did represented $200,000 worth of business for
us,'' Lattimore said.
</P>
<P>
   Kilgour &AMP; Sweet will still be available in Milburn at Debra
Gilbert Smith, 351 Milburn Ave., which sells Isaac Mizrahi and
Badgley Mischka. ``I'm excited,'' Ms. Gilbert Smith said. ``The
collection fills a need for distinctive kinds of things that aren't
available in the regular market, particularly for people who go to
events, daytime or black tie.''

CONNECTICUT'S JOHNSON: CAUGHT IN THE PERILOUS MIDDLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINSTED, Conn. _ It's Dessert Night with the Candidates at the
Elks Lodge, and Rep. Nancy Johnson, a Republican, finds herself
defending her party's drawn-out handling of President Clinton's
fate. Back in Washington, she was on the other side, rankling party
leaders with sharp criticism over the release of X-rated evidence
against the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's frustrating,'' Mrs. Johnson tells skeptical
couples in this tiny town in Connecticut's Northwest Hills, as
red-white-and-blue balloon bouquets bob all around her. ``But a
fairer process produces a surer result.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Johnson, proud guardian of the middle, is now caught there.
In closed-door sessions in Washington, she speaks up for
constituents who say they have heard enough about Monica Lewinsky
and want the country to ``move on.'' But when she returns home to
campaign for re-election in a district that has more registered
Democrats than Republicans and that went for Clinton in 1992 and
1996, she confronts a problem that many of her colleagues face:
defending the way Speaker Newt Gingrich and other Republican
leaders are handling the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides are right,'' she said with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Johnson said her constituents were strongly in favor of
Clinton's resigning, although she said that did not translate into
support for impeachment. ``They don't like impeachment because it's
so slow,'' she said. ``I have to try to explain that our
constitutional process protects us all, and my party is responsible
for leading this process.''
</P>
<P>
   Compounding Mrs. Johnson's problem, she is running in a tight
race against a Democrat whom she barely defeated two years ago and
who has accused Mrs. Johnson of advocating moderation in one breath
and embracing the conservative leadership in the next.
</P>
<P>
   Complexity does not always play well in an election, and many
voters are skeptical of Mrs. Johnson's go-slow mantra. At Dessert
Night, Ruth Church, 81, said she had been a supporter of Mrs.
Johnson's since they worked on women's issues together 25 years
ago, and lauded the endorsement of Mrs. Johnson by the Sierra Club
and the National Education Association _ a rare duo for a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Church said the case had been made against the
president. ``If we drag it out, President Clinton will become a
martyr,'' Mrs. Church said. ``He's a regular alley cat.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Mrs. Johnson and other moderate Republicans _
by their count 30 to 60 out of the House's 228 Republicans _ have
felt a tad lonely in a party led by firebrands. For 11 years, a
``lunch bunch'' founded by Mrs. Johnson and other moderates has met
once a week for pizza and salads to discuss issues like family
planning and environmental protection. While these softer voices
have long been in the background, they may soon be needed to sell
the notion of impeachment to the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a bloc, the moderates will play a pivotal role on
impeachment,'' said Marshall Wittman, director of congressional
relations for the Heritage Foundation, a conservative policy
institute. ``They are going to want a more bipartisan process, and
the leadership is going to have to keep them in the tent.''
</P>
<P>
   So that means listening to Nancy Johnson, 63, who was elected to
Congress in 1982 and is now the fifth-ranking Republican on the
Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Johnson represents a district that is vast and varied,
stretching from the comfortable suburbs of the Farmington Valley,
west of Hartford, to the opulent retreats in Litchfield County to
her working-class home, New Britain, a dying manufacturing center
that proudly calls itself the Hardware City.
</P>
<P>
   During a night of aerobic campaigning after Saturday afternoon
votes in Washington, Mrs. Johnson started in Winsted, then hit a
black-tie ball held by the Torrington Elks, who have a bar and a
bowling alley in the basement of a vast, white-columned lodge
reminiscent of a Southern plantation house. Clinton had few fans
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's roast him and toast him _ air some laundry,'' said Bruce
Strawinski, 44, an investment salesman who teaches karate on the
side.
</P>
<P>
   Forty miles away, Mrs. Johnson spent more than an hour trying to
be heard over the salsa music at a Puerto Rican tribute dinner,
where almost everyone was a Democrat and drank Budweiser from cans.
In this crowd, Clinton was a victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``A man is a man,'' said Omar Aguilera, 59, a radio station
director with portraits of the president at home and at work.
``Everyone has a moment, when there's provocation to you.''
</P>
<P>
   That produces quite a tightrope for Mrs. Johnson, who attributes
her near loss in 1996 to a Washington workload that caused her to
neglect her constituents in the 6th District. Perhaps more damaging
was the nature of the work: She was chairman of the Ethics
Committee, and was perceived as trying to protect Gingrich when
Democrats filed charges against him. ``If I win by 1,500 votes
again, I can tell you, I won't be here in two more years,'' she
told the Winsted crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Johnson's Democratic opponent, Charlotte Koskoff, argues
that Mrs. Johnson is a shrewd foil for Republican leaders, since
she talks a maverick line but will support them on the most crucial
votes. Asked where she would put Mrs. Johnson on the ideological
spectrum, Ms. Koskoff said, ``Opportunist.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Koskoff, 56, a liberal former education professor, gives out
T-shirts that say, ``This time, Charlotte,'' and introduces herself
to voters by saying: ``I'm the gutsy outsider who nearly defeated a
seven-term incumbent. I'll fight just as hard for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in the district expect Mrs. Johnson to win more
easily this year. She has been running a heavy television campaign,
and Ms. Koskoff's has not begun yet. On the campaign trail, Ms.
Koskoff says her top priority will be keeping and creating jobs.
Saying she will stand up for ``working and retired people,'' she
says she will work to regulate health maintenance organizations and
protect Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sam Stratman, a spokesman for the Judiciary Committee, said
moderates from both parties would play a crucial role in insuring
that the process was viewed as credible. Stratman said the
committee was moving as expeditiously as possible, given the volume
of material that had to be reviewed. ``We are criticized if we go
too fast or go too slow,'' he said. ``Do these serious allegations
deserve a close look, or do we look away?''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the moderate Republicans do not have _ and do not
plan, several said _ a united position on how to handle the
possibility of impeachment proceedings. Rep. Christopher Shays,
another moderate from Connecticut, said he would have ``a high
threshold'' for concluding that Clinton had committed an
impeachable offense, since he was elected twice by voters who
probably knew what they were getting.
</P>
<P>
   Shays said there would be no lunch-bunch stand on the matter,
however. ``If moderate Republicans end up voting the same on this,
that is a powerful bloc in either direction,'' he said. ``But this
is a conscience issue _ a vote that each member will have to live
with for the rest of their lives _ and they have to come to their
own conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings
Institution, said moderates could shape the debate significantly
after the November election. Mann said that until then, with polls
showing that the most likely voters favor Republican candidates,
the party's leaders will have little incentive to compromise. ``The
political imperative is to maintain the intensity of the core
constituency,'' he said. ``There is going to be a lot of pressure
for the moderates to stick with the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Johnson said she has no hesitation and already counts one
success in the debate, after what she could have taken as a
humiliating rebuke. Two weeks ago, about 100 members of the
Republican caucus were meeting privately at the Capitol and
discussing the release of Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony
in the investigation being conducted by the Whitewater special
prosecutor, Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   As she explains it, she was arguing against releasing parts of
the tape that she saw as unnecessarily graphic or repetitious. ``We
don't need more information on the sexual stuff,'' she said. ``We
don't need to go into cigars. We don't need to know numbers of
times.'' She admits that at the time, she gave a more abbreviated
version of that, and all her colleagues heard was, ``Don't release
the tape.''

   ``The caucus politely booed,'' Mrs. Johnson said. ``People
moaned. They groaned. It was low, but it was significant.''
Gingrich then gave what many members took as a sharp rebuttal,
saying the American people had the right to know the facts.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's spokeswoman, Christina Martin, said: ``The speaker
and Nancy Johnson have a very warm relationship. They work together
just fine, and shared a laugh on the floor shortly after the
conference.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole tape was released. On Friday, the House Judiciary
Committee took a different approach when it voted to release a new
raft of tapes and documents. Republicans, feeling public opinion
turning against them, bent over backward to agree with Democrats on
blacking out the most sensitive parts. ``This week, lots of people
said, `Boy, you were right,''' Mrs. Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Mrs. Johnson's opponent, Ms. Koskoff, acknowledged that in
retrospect, Mrs. Johnson had been right about sanitizing the
release of the Monica Lewinsky material. ``That seems to be almost
universal,'' Mrs. Koskoff said. ``People are angry at Republicans
for the salacious detail.''

MANNY RAMIREZ' SILENT SEASON  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS BROUSSARD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The problem with a historic baseball season is that
there are always casualties. Those with the marvelous performances
receive the lion's share of recognition while those with the
lesser, though still notable, achievements are dwarfed, relegated
to doing great things in virtual anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   So with Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa waging the most captivating
home run war the game has seen, it was no surprise that the
late-season power surge of the Cleveland Indians' Manny Ramirez was
accompanied by little fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   While McGwire and Sosa were on their way to posting
never-before-seen totals, Ramirez, from New York City, accomplished
a remarkable feat himself. From Sept. 15 to Sept. 19, he hit eight
home runs in five games, including four in four consecutive at-bats
against Toronto and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   But Ramirez, who will start in right field Tuesday when the
Indians begin their American League division series against the
Boston Red Sox at Jacobs Field, does not feel like a casualty. The
26-year-old does not care about being in the spotlight. He would
prefer to be left alone, allowed to play baseball without the
hindrance of microphones, cameras and notebooks.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing to be shy rather than rude, Ramirez is so
uncomfortable with receiving attention that earlier this season he
refused to grant an interview to the Indians for a flattering
article in Gameface magazine, the franchise's own publication.
</P>
<P>
   Though he speaks politely but unenthusiastically after most
games, he invariably invokes excuses such as ``I'm tired,'' or
``Later,'' to avoid pre-game sitdowns with reporters, as happened
when he was approached Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Ramirez hopes to let his bat do the talking. But with
the All-Star right-hander Pedro Martinez (19-7) starting for
Boston, that could remain silent as well.
</P>
<P>
   A career .302 hitter, Ramirez recorded career highs of 45 homers
and 145 runs batted in while batting .294 this year, but in 11
plate appearances against Martinez, he managed only one hit.
Martinez had similar success against the Indians, going 2-0 with a
1.44 earned run average in three starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good stuff gets good hitters out,'' said Indians Manager Mike
Hargrove, who will start the right-hander Jaret Wright (12-10) in
Game 1. ``If Pedro is on his game, then things are going to be very
tough for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, a veteran of five major league seasons, has yet to
sparkle in the playoffs. Though his nine career post-season homers
are a franchise record, he has batted just .215. But this season he
has been the epitome of clutch, going 8 for 15 with 17 RBI with the
bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   For the Indians, the most delightful part of Ramirez's play
might be his improvement in the field and on the bases. A third
baseman in high school, he was moved to the outfield after the
Indians made him the 13th overall selection in the 1991 draft. Lost
away from the infield, he became known for making comical yet
critical errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Manny first joined us a few years ago, he was fielding
the ball on the wrong foot and stuff like that,'' said Dave Nelson,
an Indian broadcaster who was the club's first-base and
base-running coach from 1992 to 1997. ``He really wasn't a very
confident outfielder. But I've never had a guy who worked as hard
as Manny worked to make himself better.''
</P>
<P>
   After showing great improvement last season, Ramirez emerged
this year as one of the best defensive right fielders in the
American League, according to Nelson and Cleveland General Manager
John Hart. Blessed with a strong arm, he hits cutoff men better
than any of his teammates and has a sure glove.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 14, he climbed the Jacobs Field wall to rob Toronto's
Jose Canseco of a home run, and just last week at Yankee Stadium,
made a superb back-handed grab in the gap between center and right
field.
</P>
<P>
   And, once known for his ridiculous base-running blunders,
Ramirez has not been picked off since the All-Star Game break.
Though a small feat for most, that is quite an accomplishment for a
player who used to get nailed off the bag about once a month.
</P>
<P>
   All-round improvement aside, Ramirez will always be known for
his hitting. A naturally pure swinger who entered the majors
hitting piercing line drives, Ramirez added outstanding power to
his game this year. He hit 25 homers and drove in 74 runs after the
All-Star Game break, and the Indians' hitting coach, Charlie
Manuel, thinks he can put together entire seasons like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you pass 40 homers in a season, you're in that elite
class,'' Manuel said. ``Yeah, Manny can hit 50. Can he hit 66 like
Sammy Sosa? I don't know. But I don't rule out anything that Manny
can do as a hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitting 66, now that would get Ramirez some recognition.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INSIDE PITCH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, the defending American League champions, have been
inconsistent all year but especially lately. After winning eight of
nine games, they ended the regular season by losing five of their
last six and almost surrendered the home-field advantage to the
Texas Rangers. Asked if his club had been trying to turn it on and
off, Manager  &UR; MIKE HARGROVE  &LR; said: ``It's not a matter of flipping
the switch. The switch has been flipped; it just isn't working.''
... Boston won the season series between the two clubs by 8-3,
including a 3-2 edge at Jacobs Field.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After more than 18 months of squabbling and
stalemate, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and the
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat have agreed on the essentials of
an Israeli withdrawal from another 13 percent of the West Bank,
senior American and Israeli officials said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Such an agreement would leave the Palestinians with political
control over 40 percent of the West Bank, including 98 percent of
the Palestinian population.
</P>
<P>
   But a flurry of negotiations in New York over the weekend and a
meeting here on Monday with President Clinton failed to complete
the agreement. Unresolved issues include parallel Palestinian
actions to insure Israeli security and to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright both said
they hoped to finish the deal in further three-way talks to be held
here in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, after meeting Netanyahu and Arafat for nearly 90
minutes on Monday morning in the Oval Office, said substantial
progress had been made, and the two men accepted his invitation to
meet again, perhaps at Camp David, the retreat in Maryland where
President Carter helped the Egyptians and Israelis come to a peace
settlement in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that we all agreed that we have made progress on the
path to peace,'' Clinton told reporters. He described ``a
significant narrowing of the gaps between the two parties across a
wide range of issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel accepted a compromise whereby nearly a quarter of the 13
percent withdrawal _ 3 percent of the West Bank _ would be labeled
a nature reserve where Palestinians would not be allowed to live.
The land is uninhabited desert scrubland.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton warned that there is a ``substantial amount of work to
be done until a comprehensive agreement can be reached.'' Albright,
saying there was now ``new urgency,'' is to travel to the Middle
East next week with the American negotiator, Dennis Ross, to
prepare for the final push next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to work at this now and see if we can get it
done,'' Clinton said, before having a separate meeting with
Netanyahu. On Tuesday he will meet Arafat, who traveled after
Monday's meeting to New York to deliver a speech before the General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, looking to display mastery of his foreign-policy duties
in the midst of his troubles concerning his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky, is clearly hoping to have a success to announce
shortly before the mid-term elections in November. Netanyahu is now
eager to have an interim settlement that will forestall a
unilateral announcement by Arafat of an independent Palestinian
state, which he has threatened to make if the original timetable
runs out on May 4 of next year without a final agreement.
</P>
<P>
   And Arafat, his position undermined by nearly 19 months of
stalemate, wants formal control over another sizable chunk of the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a nature reserve was an American one, intended to
persuade Netanyahu to accept the 13 percent withdrawal level. He
once said that an interim withdrawal of more than 9 percent would
be a potentially mortal blow to the Israeli state, but Albright
insisted that 13 percent was the minimum credible withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu said on Monday that he and the Americans were ``very
very close to an agreement on the parcels of land'' _ provided
agreement can be reached on the specifics of Palestinian actions to
dismantle terrorist cells, extradite prisoners, confiscate excess
guns and stop ``incitment'' of citizens through anti-Israel
speeches, sermons and propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   The timing and size of a future third redeployment remain to be
resolved. That redeployment will be part of the basic questions to
be resolved in final status talks that will open, at least with a
formal ceremony, as soon as this interim agreement is complete.
</P>
<P>
   But American officials expressed confidence now that an
agreement was within reach, especially given that both Netanyahu
and Arafat have committed to a timetable for the October meeting.
As important, they insisted, was that the two men were able to
``clear some of the poisoned air between them,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who has been the American figure most engaged in this
often frustrating search for a deal, met Sunday night in New York
with Netanyahu and Arafat, their first meeting together in nearly a
year. It was then that she decided that time would be ripe for
Monday's three-way meeting with Clinton and for the effort to
accelerate a settlement in a set of intensive negotiations in
October.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Ms. Albright, after meeting both men in London, issued a
form of ultimatum to Netanyahu, to agree on an interim deal in time
to come to Washington the next week, meet with Clinton and begin
final status talks. But Netanyahu backtracked, and Clinton backed
down on any notion of pressuring Israel publicly after a lobbying
firestorm in Congress stoked by the American Israel Public Affairs
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Other smaller issues, put aside early on, must now also be
settled, including Israeli promises to allow the Palestinians to
run an airport in Gaza, to open an industrial park there and to
provide safe passage for Palestinians moving between the West Bank
and Gaza. But this agreement, if it happens, will only begin the
much-harder task of negotiating a final peace settlement between
the Israelis and Palestinians, including resolving the status of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Hebron accords negotiated by Netanyahu in January
1997, and a side letter from then-Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, the three interim withdrawals called for under the
Oslo accords were to start in March 1997 and be completed within 12
months, but not later than mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the interim withdrawals have so far taken place,
because Israel's proposed first withdrawal was rejected by the
Palestinians as too small. The current negotiation would combine
the first and second withdrawals, leaving the third to be decided
once final status talks begin.

   KISNA REKA, Serbia _ Heavy rain and winds slashed the makeshift
ethnic Albanian refugee camps in Kosovo Monday, and many
inhabitants, who have been living outdoors for months, were left
cold, wet and encrusted in mud.
</P>
<P>
   About two miles up the steep hill that rises above this village,
muddy water gushed through tents and small children dressed in
light clothing squished around barefoot. They described shivering
in the night, as they tried to sleep sandwiched together shoulder
to shoulder on leaky wooden tent floors.
</P>
<P>
   The autumn squall was a reminder of worse to come, but in the
hills and canyons where the refugees have been hiding from the
onslaught of Serbian artillery, the mood remained defiant.
</P>
<P>
   Many said they were not ready to go back to their ruined homes
and villages. There, they said, they feared being encircled by the
Serbian police, who had torched their places and forced them to
flee during a summer offensive against ethnic Albanian insurgents.
</P>
<P>
   There were practical reasons, too, for not returning. ``Few
people can prepare their damaged houses for the winter because they
don't have the building materials,'' explained Habib Qelaj, 62, a
retired math teacher and an elder of Kisna Reka. ``If they have the
money for the materials, they don't have anywhere to buy them.''
</P>
<P>
   How long would Qelaj stay in his tepee-shaped tent, with its
wooden floor, metal roof lining and comfortable cushions strewn
around inside? ``Until my soul comes through my nose,'' he said,
using an Albanian proverb that is a way of saying forever.
</P>
<P>
   Western governments are increasingly concerned about the plight
of the ethnic Albanians _ who have been forced from their villages
by the Yugoslav Army and the Serbian police acting under the
direction of the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   After failing to stop Milosevic from punishing hundreds of
thousands of civilians during his fight against the Kosovo
Liberation Army, Western officials now acknowledge that U.N.
agencies and other relief organizations will have to cope with the
needs of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, estimates
that more than 250,000 Albanians have fled their homes since
fighting for control of the Serbian province started six months
ago. Some tens of thousands have fled to Montenegro and Albania,
but most have stayed in Kosovo. Some have returned to their damaged
homes, others are doubling up with relatives and about 50,000 are
thought to be camped out in places like the hill above Kisna Reka.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has tried to play down the crisis in Kosovo, insisting
that Albanians are well taken care of. According to Western relief
officials, the Serbian police have begun dispersing new groups of
refugees as they form, in order to make the problem seem smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ogata said that during a meeting with Milosevic in Belgrade
last Friday, he disputed her estimate of 50,000 Albanian refugees
without shelter. He asserted that there were 700 refugees outside,
Mrs. Ogata said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   As they have many times in the past few weeks, the Serbian
authorities announced Monday that their tank and artillery
offensive against the Kosovo Liberation Army had ended. In Monday's
declaration, Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic speaking at a
special session of the Serbian legislature, stressed that ``peace
reigns in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Life has been normalized. Serbia has thwarted the
secessionists,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Marjanovic said extra Yugoslav and Serbian forces sent to Kosovo
for the offensive had returned to their barracks in Kosovo. His
statement appeared to be meant to impress Western diplomats who
have asked Milosevic to withdraw the extra troops from Kosovo as a
first step to a political solution.
</P>
<P>
   But as Marjanovic declared victory, workers of the U.N. refugee
agency said they heard artillery fire at Stimlje, 15 miles or so
southwest of Pristina, Kosovo's capital, and were prevented by
Serbian police officers from entering the area.
</P>
<P>
   They also said they had been told that about 15,000 people were
fleeing a dozen villages just southeast of Suva Reka, after the
Yugoslav Army shelled the area Sunday. And in a six-mile swath of
territory around Musutiste, southeast of Suva Reka, Western
monitors said they saw about 50 columns of smoke Monday, indicating
burning villages and houses.
</P>
<P>
   In Kisna Reka, Hajrije Gara, 35, said that during the day she
felt safe coming down from the muddy hillside to cook in the burned
dining room of her house.
</P>
<P>
   ``The army is over there,'' she said, pointing to a mountain
beyond the garden. ``They fire at night, not necessarily in our
direction anymore, but they frighten us.''

SPORTS COLUMN: NO EMOTION ON DISPLAY THIS TIME  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tuesday night the father and son will be on opposite sides in a
short series that will leave one of them disappointed. Literature
is full of parents and children who must eventually confront each
other as adults. This is neither the Civil War nor Tolstoy. This is
a case of two professionals, proud of each other. Todd Stottlemyre
is a pitcher with the Texas Rangers; his father, Mel, is the
pitching coach with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams meet Tuesday night at Yankee Stadium, where Todd
used to gambol under the stands while Mel was out supporting his
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a playground,'' Todd recalled Monday. ``Family days
were special. Running around the clubhouse, playing tape ball. At
the time, I felt every kid had the same privileges. When I made the
leap, I realized how difficult it was to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he is there, a tall, slender, lynx-eyed pitcher with
corn-colored hair, just like his father. They are the only
father-son combination in baseball history with 100 victories each.
(The father had 164, all with the Yankees; the son has 123.)
</P>
<P>
   Monday night they planned to have dinner together. When the son
did his news conference up at the Stadium Monday afternoon, he was
asked what they might discuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going on a hunting trip in November,'' Todd Stottlemyre
offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get our plans together for Christmas,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in the market for a pickup truck,'' the son continued,
with a pretty decent deadpan pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``That isn't the answer you're looking for,'' he said dryly.
</P>
<P>
   They were trying to avoid digging into their own emotions, not
that it is their public habit in the first place. Because the
father and the son have flip-flopped from one league to another
during Todd's decade in the majors, they have opposed each other
once before, back on Aug. 15, in Todd's old playpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may sound goofy, but I got chill bumps seeing them
talking before that game,'' said Johnny Oates, the manager of the
Rangers. ``I could only think how proud I would be in that
situation. We always want to do well for our dads.''
</P>
<P>
   That night, Jean Stottlemyre was on her feet all game, rooting
for her son, who was the winning pitcher in the 16-5 victory over
Mel's team. However, that was a regular-season game. This time Todd
could almost single-handedly destroy a 114-victory season by
winning the first and fifth games of this frighteningly quick
series. The understanding is that both men have obligations to
their own teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very competitive,'' Todd said of Mel. ``He has a true
affection for his pitchers. It has to be strange, seeing his son in
a different-colored uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   The son can know the father very well, and not gain any
advantage from it, but the father could gain from his knowledge of
his son. Mel taught his children to play ball. Mel Jr. was a
pitcher who did not quite make it in the majors, and Todd is a
playoff-level pitcher. ``I'm proud of both of them,'' Mel said
Monday. ``It's like a doctor's son might go into the surgery room,
and want to grow up to be a doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the third son, Jason, who died of leukemia in his
teens. Todd said he thinks of his brother every day. In August, the
father allowed as how Jason would have always rooted for Todd, even
against Mel's Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going into my feelings this time,'' Mel said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Feelings are one thing; knowledge is another. Mel watches his
son on the cable all the time. It is the nature of his craft to
pick up little things. Does the kid tip off what pitch he's
throwing? Can you bunt on him? Does he hold runners on base? Mel
said Monday that he never talks shop with Todd during the season
because he has too much respect for other managers and coaches. But
he knows his own son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better fastball, better curve than I had,'' the father said.
``I was able to hide my emotions more, but he's gotten better at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Would the father tell the Yankees the best way to beat his son?
There are different versions of this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah, Mel is very involved in our preparation,'' said Joe
Torre, the manager of the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have great scouts who have given us great scouting
reports,'' Mel said. ``My job is to prepare my pitchers for the
Texas hitters. Chris Chambliss is our hitting coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Did Todd think it would be a distraction to pitch against his
father? He nodded yes before he said, ``Yeah, probably, but the
closer to the game, the more focused I will be.'' And, yes, his
mother is still allowed to root for him.
</P>

HURRICANE GEORGES MOVES INLAND, LOSES SOME OF ITS PUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Ala., Miss., Fla.)  (lh) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ From the eastern reaches of New Orleans to
Pensacola, Fla., Hurricane Georges pounded the Gulf Coast on Monday
with destructive winds and even more destructive rains, then slowly
began to loose some of its punch as its drifted inland.
</P>
<P>
   Battering the beaches, towns and cities of Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle with winds up to 100
miles an hour and more than a foot of rain, it left trees uprooted,
power lines down, roads washed out and hundreds of homes and
businesses badly knocked about or flooded.
</P>
<P>
   It spawned tornadoes, most of them harmless, though the winds of
one were clocked at 174 miles an hour as it spun past an airport.
The hurricane pounded a crippled ship and the tug that was towing
it so hard that Coast Guard officials worried both might founder.
And it was blamed for two deaths in New Orleans, one occurring when
an elderly woman suffered a heart attack while being evacuated from
her flooded home and the other occurring when a man set his
darkened house afire while trying to light it with a candle.
</P>
<P>
   But despite all the misery and grief caused when Georges roared
ashore out of the Gulf before daybreak Monday morning, its eye
centered on Biloxi, Miss., the storm was not its old killer self.
</P>
<P>
   It could not sustain its 100-mile-an-hour-plus winds for long
once it began to drag over land, leading weather forecasters to
predict, cautiously, that it would probably blow itself out in the
next few days. Moreover, Gulf Coast residents, given plenty of
warning that Georges earlier had killed 300 people and left 100,000
more homeless down in the Caribbean, largely avoided its worst by
battening down ahead of time and fleeing, when they could, to
higher ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could have been a lot worse,'' Kenny Campo, a marina operator
said, as he surveyed his mostly unscathed place in low-lying St.
Bernard Parish, southeast of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Pensacola was awash in more than 20 inches of rain that fell
there in less than 24 hours. But for all that, flood damage was
relatively minor in most places.
</P>
<P>
   A few streets in downtown Mobile, Ala., were waist-deep in sea
water, and the causeway leading southeast out of town was hit by a
sea surge that swept away some stores and restaurants. Yet most of
the city's businesses and homes escaped.
</P>
<P>
   One Mobile resident, Sandra Pettway, was less traumatized by
Georges than the 8-foot alligator it drove up into the housing
project in which she lives with her three children. ``Some people
were shooting at him,'' she said. ``But I didn't have a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   In Biloxi, there was also flooding. But the town's main
attraction, its casinos, largely escaped serious damage _ though
not a loss of revenue from having to shut down for several days. A
few miles further west, in Gulfport, the wind blew so hard at one
point that it toppled over an 18-wheel tractor-trailer on
Interstate 10.
</P>
<P>
   But most houses and businesses escaped with only a scratch or
two. And in New Orleans, the place where Georges potentially could
have caused a huge catastrophe _ the city has the Gulf Coast's
largest concentration of people and lies 6 feet below sea level
behind its levees _ there was hardly any real damage except along
the shores of Lake Ponchartrain, where storm-driven waves smashed a
line of fishing shacks and cottages.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   By late afternoon, with Georges beginning to slowly drift off
toward the northeast and winds and rains letting up a bit, New
Orleanians, especially those hunkered down in makeshift shelters
like the Superdome, began to chafe for their freedom.
</P>
<P>
   A curfew was still in effect _ ``for your safety until we can
get things straightened out a bit,'' Mayor Marc Morial said _ but
with each passing hour it was ignored by more and more people. Down
in the old French Quarter, Chris LeBoeuf ventured forth and opened
his souvenir shop. And in no time customers were arriving,
especially tourists who had been trapped in their hotels for two
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come in, and they're just glad to have some place to go
for a change,'' LeBoeuf said. The police let it go.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the city's store owners, Frank Ordano, complained
that power company crews had not been fast enough getting power
restored. ''There's no bad weather here,'' he declared. ``Sunday
was a little bit rainy and wind, Monday even less so.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Mobile, by late in the day, the had-enough-of-all-this
story was much the same, though the wind there was still blowing up
to 60 miles an hour, and the rain was still coming down. Debbie
Stephens, hunkered down at home rather than in a shelter, said she
and her family were safe enough but the power was out and ``there's
just nothing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just about to die from boredom,'' she continued. ``There's
no power, no television, no stereo. You can't read. We've played
all the games. And now everybody's eating everything in sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Kirk Fordice of Mississippi said after an early look at the
damage in his state that while Mississippians had been lucky,
foresight also had played a major role in limiting loss. ``The
preparation for this emergency,'' he said, ``is much better than in
years past.''
</P>
<P>
   Weather forecasters predicted that because Georges began to lose
some of its punch as soon as it came ashore early Monday morning,
it probably would lose still more power overnight as it inched
further inland _ barring an unexpected resurgence of energy. By
Tuesday, they said, its maximum sustained winds should be well
below 75 miles an hour, the hurricane force threshold.
</P>
<P>
   The forecasters, however, along with public safety officials,
warned that because the storm was so saturated with rain after a
slow meander across the tropical waters of the Gulf, and because it
was moving inland so slowly, the Gulf Coast and the rest of the
Deep South should be on the lookout for heavy flooding over the
next several days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not quite out of the water yet,'' Police Chief Ben
Morris told the residents of Slidell, La., on the Mississippi
border, as they began to emerge from shelters and boarded up homes
to take up the task of cleaning up behind Georges.

For starters, Astros and Padres on even keel
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOSEPH DUARTE
</P>
<P>
   In a first-round pitching mismatch in 1997, it was Greg Maddux,
Tom Glavine, John Smoltz and you're out for the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Astros return on equal footing _ at least on
paper _ in the pitching department against the San Diego Padres,
today's opponent in the opener of the National League division
series at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a team I think we stack up with just about anybody our
numbers are very comparable, other than the Atlanta Braves,'' said
Astros lefthander Randy Johnson, who will face San Diego's Kevin
Brown in a marquee Game One pitching matchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are right behind them, if not even. If you throw
most of the numbers out that you've accumulated over the season
when postseason comes into play, in a five-game series, just about
anything can happen in a short series.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres' will go with a three-man rotation of Brown, Andy
Ashby and Joey Hamilton, all righthanders, against the Astros.
Houston will counter with Johnson, righthander Shane Reynolds and
probably lefthander Mike Hampton, although manager Larry Dierker
also has the option of starting Jose Lima.
</P>
<P>
   Little separates the two staffs. The Astros ranks second in the
NL in ERA (3.53). San Diego is third (3.53). The Padres have thrown
14 complete games; the Astros have 12. Each team has 11 shutouts
(San Diego had only three in 1997).
</P>
<P>
   Five of the nine meetings between the two in 1998 were decided
by one run, which includes the last three in late July. Houston won
the season series 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who was traded to the Padres from the Florida Marlins,
was a catalyst in the Padres' second division title in three
seasons. He went 18-7 with a 2.38 ERA and 257 strikeouts and won 14
of 15 decisions from May 26 to Aug. 25, including 11 straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Kevin Brown would make a difference on this ballclub. I
just didn't know it would be this much,'' San Diego manager Bruce
Bochy said.
</P>
<P>
   For further proof of Brown's impressive credentials, you need
only ask opposing hitters, who are hitting .235 against him.
Brown's movement on his pitches has been described as ``nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering the playoffs, however, Brown is winless since Sept. 5,
a span of four starts, in part because of scarce run support.
</P>
<P>
   After becoming the NL's first 16-game winner, Ashby (17-9) went
six starts _ three losses _ before his next victory while suffering
from tendinitis in his left hip. During a four-game stretch in late
August, Ashby gave up 24 earned runs in 17 1/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's No. 3 starter, likely Hamilton, won a $3.2 million
arbitration settlement prior to the season and responded with a
mediocre 13-13 record.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton lost six straight decisions from May 7-June 3 that
dropped his record to 3-7. He followed with four straight victories
but managed to creep above .500 only once (12-11 on Aug. 31) the
remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Padres pose a particular problem for us in the sense that
their top two pitchers are right-handed and most of our hitters are
right-handed,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said. ``They also
have, at least on paper, the best closer (Trevor Hoffman) in the
league this year, so, they're a formidable opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That said, we won the season series from them, we won the
season series with the Braves, we won 102 games, I don't think were
going to be nervous or worried or feel overmatched.``
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, sorely lacking a dominant No. 1 starter, filled the
void with a last-minute trade with Seattle to obtain Johnson on
July 31. He is 10-1 with a 1.28 ERA and has been unbeatable at the
Astrodome with a 5-0 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``People make it out to be an impossible task,'' San Diego
outfielder Steve Finley said. ``You just have to put a good swing
on the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds is coming off the best season of his career, winning 19
games and just missing the Astros' first 20-win season since 1989
with a no-decision Saturday against the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, who missed two weeks with a strained groin, battled
back from a slow start in the second half to post his third
consecutive double-digit victory total. Lima has been the surprise
of the season with 16 wins after spending most of his career as a
reliever.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the attention on the starters, the game could be
decided by the bullpen. San Diego's Trevor Hoffman tied a league
record with 53 saves and is a leading contender for the NL Cy Young
Award. Houston's Billy Wagner has 30 saves to go along with his
100-mph fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to try and beat them before the ninth inning,''
Astros second baseman Craig Biggio said. ``I know they don't want
to face Wags, and we don't want to face Trevor.``
</P>
<P>
   So which team is the favorite?
</P>
<P>
   ``That favorite thing doesn't mean anything,'' Astros outfielder
Moises Alou said. ``You have to go out there and play your game. We
played them well during the regular season. That really gives you a
lot of confidence going into the playoffs. It's not like the swept
us or they beat us all the time. We are pretty even.''

ADVERTISING: MAKING COGNAC HIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In recent years, advertising for Cognac has assiduously played
down references to heritage and pedigree because younger consumers
seemed to perceive all those designations of V.S., V.S.O.P. and XO
as spelling out F-O-R-O-L-D-F-O-L-K-S. That trend continues in two
campaigns, now being introduced at the same time, for two leading
Cognac brands.
</P>
<P>
   Hennessy, the world's best-selling name in the Cognac category,
is being described as ``Appropriately complex'' in a print campaign
by its longtime agency, Kirshenbaum Bond &AMP; Partners in New York.
And Remy Martin, the somewhat more expensive Cognac that is the No.
2 brand worldwide, is concentrating on the centaur character that
appears on each bottle in a print and radio campaign by DDB Paris
that carries the theme ``Only Remy.''
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns are emblematic of the increasing image
orientation in spirits marketing as emotional appeals gain the top
shelf above pitches centered on product attributes. Both are also
intended to stimulate demand among drinkers in their 20s and 30s,
who are a decade or two (or more) younger than those who have
traditionally bought Cognac. So there are attractive, hip-looking
models, elements of fashion and even hints of humor.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to further dispel attitudes that Cognac is only
``for after dinner, cold weather, drawing rooms and smoking
jackets,'' said Clint Rodenberg, senior vice president for
marketing at Schieffelin &AMP; Somerset Co. in New York. That firm, a
joint venture of Diageo PLC and LVMH Moet-Hennessy Louis Vuitton
SA, distributes Hennessy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Hilary Peck, marketing director at Remy Amerique Inc. in New
York, a unit of Remy-Cointreau SA, agreed with that assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is to humanize'' Cognac, Ms. Peck said, ``to
make it more accessible and relevant, welcoming, affable and
approachable.''
</P>
<P>
   That is to be accomplished ``while retaining our current
franchise,'' she added _ that is, not alienating the older
consumers who compose the core group of Cognac aficionados.
</P>
<P>
   For Hennessy, the ads focusing on complexity come after a
long-running campaign centered on ``the feeling of Hennessy
Cognac,'' which was likened to a romantic kiss, jazz, a manly hug
and quiet contentment. Those ads were supplemented with spiels for
mixed drinks like martinis and sidecars with recipes rejiggered to
include Hennessy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brands need to reinvent themselves,'' said Richard
Kirshenbaum, co-chairman and chief creative officer at Kirshenbaum
Bond. ``We're competing in a complex world where consumers face an
enormous amount of choices and options.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that complexity is the focus of the print ads in the
Hennessy campaign, which superimpose busy-looking charts and graphs
over photographs of 20- and 30-somethings. Some ads rank men and
women on such attributes as ``shortstop,'' ``klutz,'' ``failed
comedian,'' ``procrastinator'' and ``flirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Other ads outline influences on a personality from ``the smell
of clean sheets'' and a mysterious ``Adam incident'' to ``Jamie's
hair'' and ``mowing the lawn in Florida.'' The various ads are
accompanied by smaller recipe ads requesting that drinkers ``savor
the complexity'' of drinks mixed with Hennessy.
</P>
<P>
   But will complexity register as something positive or negative?
</P>
<P>
   ``We did about four months' worth of research,'' said Elizabeth
Sorota, senior brand manager for Hennessy at Schieffelin &AMP;
Somerset, ``and found that consumers saw complexity as depth of
character and having diversity in one's life. Those attributes were
very appealing and relevant to our target audience, especially the
25-to-34-year-old who drinks premium spirits.''
</P>
<P>
   Hennessy is introducing the campaign nationally, with an
emphasis on the New York market; there will be posters and
samplings at bars and restaurants in addition to the print ads. The
budget, which Rodenberg estimated at $5 million for 1997, will
increase to $7.7 million this year, $16 million next year and about
$21 million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Remy campaign, the centaur-centric work from DDB
Paris is appearing around the world, customized for each country by
local teams. In this country, the campaign replaces ads that showed
bottles of Cognac perched _ literally and figuratively _ on
pedestals. Those ads were created by the Martin Agency in Richmond,
Va., owned by Interpublic Group of Cos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pedestal was a device, a way to wink at the consumer about
the luxury, status and prestige of Remy,'' said Ms. Peck at Remy
Amerique. But research found that the centaur was more effective,
she added, because ``where there's an icon, there's a strong
communication value'' and the centaur was perceived as standing for
``strength, life, energy, independence.''
</P>
<P>
   In the print ads, the centaur is seen as a golden image
projected on black-and-white photographs of stylish younger
sensualists. The symbol is shown as a tattoo, a reflection, even as
the smoke from a cigar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the emblem of the brand put into the ad,'' said
Brigitte Constans, account director on the worldwide Remy account
at DDB Paris, part of the DDB Needham Worldwide unit of Omnicom
Group. ``It's meant to convey mystery, worldliness,
sophistication.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've moved closer to ads for perfume, clothes and other
luxury products,'' she added. ``The bottle is even shot as a bottle
of perfume would be.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the Remy campaign includes magazine and
newspaper ads; posters; radio commercials in Chicago, Los Angeles
and New York; direct marketing, and promotions at events like film
festivals. The total budget, Ms. Peck said, is close to $20
million. Overseas, there are also TV spots.
</P>
<P>
   The Remy and Hennessy campaigns come after the Hiram Walker unit
of Allied Domecq PLC began running new American ads for another
popular Cognac, Courvoisier. Those ads, featuring surreal images,
were created by Weiss, Whitten, Stagliano in New York.

YANKS' PLAYOFF MANTRA: CONCENTRATE PLAY HARD  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joe Torre intends to stand in the middle of the
Yankees' clubhouse at the Stadium Tuesday and remind his players to
continue playing as they have all year. Concentrate, play hard.
Keep everything the same, ignore the changing circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who won 114 of 162 regular-season games and
established their dominance over six months, begin the playoffs
Tuesday tonight in the three-of-five-game division series against
the American League West winner, Texas. The Yankees' David Wells
will pitch against the Rangers' Todd Stottlemyre; the game is
scheduled to begin at 8:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russian roulette,'' Torre called the five-game format. Two
quick losses and suddenly the team with the the most victories in
the annals of the American League could be on the brink of
elimination _ and the Yankees, who have played down the
significance of their success during the summer, want to follow up
their regular-season achievements with a championship and protect
their place in history. ``If we don't get to the World Series and
finish it off,'' said David Cone, ``some of the luster will be
taken off our record-breaking season. We want to finish it off, and
we're in a very good position to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells, who has developed a knowledge of Yankee history, feels
that if this team can beat the Rangers, win the AL championship
series and then the World Series, the 1998 Yankees can be ranked as
``probably the best'' team in club history. ``Everybody has
contributed, and if that should happen'' _ winning the World Series
_ ``that's what would make this team unbelievable, beyond great.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Texas Manager Johnny Oates: ``There's a certain amount of
pressure of playing 162 games and winning 114 of them, and you
realize it can all go down the drain in a matter of three days. But
Joe Torre and Don Zimmer and the rest of the staff and the players,
in particular, are capable of handling that. They know they're good
and they play with a great deal of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre decided Monday that Chad Curtis would start in left field
in Game 1, rather than the hot-hitting Shane Spencer or the
veterans Tim Raines or Darryl Strawberry. Spencer hit seven home
runs in his last 27 at-bats, becoming an instant celebrity with
Yankees fans. But Torre decided to go with Curtis, by far the best
defensive outfielder of the four, to better support the pitching of
Wells, who has a tendency to generate an unusual number of fly
balls.
</P>
<P>
   For all of his unusual attributes _ the tattoos, the occasional
petulance, the emotionalism _ Wells has established himself as a
first-rate big-game pitcher, someone who embraces pressure. He is
3-0 with a 2.48 earned run average during his career in division
series play and 1-0 with a 2.93 ERA in championship series, and has
allowed one hit and no runs in four and one-third innings in the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Wells seemed to be plummeting into his big-game trance Monday
afternoon, offering one-word greetings to teammates, his goofiness
hidden. Speaking with reporters, he was calm and direct, the same
approach he will want to take to the mound Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wells must navigate his way through a Texas lineup that averaged
nearly six runs a game this year and, incredibly, batted .315
against left-handed pitchers. The Rangers socked Wells for seven
runs in two and two-thirds innings in the Texas heat on May 6. But
on Aug. 21, Wells pitched a complete-game shutout at the Ballpark
in Arlington. The left-hander's fastball is usually reliable, but
when he is at his best _ as on May 17, when he pitched his perfect
game _ Wells' curveball is breaking sharply, with the
12-o'clock-to-6-o'clock trajectory.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees reviewed scouting reports Monday and were no doubt
informed that Mark McLemore, the Texas leadoff hitter, has been in
a prolonged slump, and that Will Clark, the Rangers' first baseman,
who bats behind Juan Gonzalez, has a fractured toe that limits his
mobility. The hitters surrounding Gonzalez could struggle; logic
suggests that Wells and the Yankees will make a habit of pitching
around the powerful right fielder in this series, or at least force
him to chase pitches out of the strike zone. Said Wells, ``You
can't make any mistakes with these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   This is particularly true with Stottlemyre throwing for the
Rangers. Stottlemyre struggled at first, after St. Louis traded him
to Texas; he seemed to be pressing, overthrowing his fastball and
breaking ball, and he was hit hard.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, who can become a free agent after this season,
realized he was uncomfortable with the idea of being a so-called
hired gun. He was acquired to play a major role for a finite time,
carrying the burden of great expectations from new teammates.
During the Yankees' games in Texas in August, Stottlemyre
approached Cone _ who had been a hired gun for Toronto in 1993 _
and asked for advice.
</P>
<P>
   Cone suggested some things to think about, suggested that
Stottlemyre relax, and Stottlemyre found his stuff, his sharp
curveball. He won his last two starts, allowing only one run in 15
innings. ``He was very nice in his last three outings,'' said
Oates, ``and dominant in his last two.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching highlights the night the Rangers clinched the division
title, Cone saw Stottlemyre hugging teammates and happily spraying
Champagne. ``He looked like he fit right in,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   Oates needs Stottlemyre to pitch deep into Tuesday night's game;
in fact, he needs all of his starters to pitch effectively and well
into the seventh or eighth inning. If the Rangers must use their
relievers in the middle innings, Oates said, they will be inviting
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked about trying to get out front and putting a
little more pressure on them,'' Oates said. ``But when you go
through what the Yankees have gone through, for the city they
represent, there's enough pressure that I don't think it's going to
be a big deal with them.''
</P>
<P>
   But the pressure of expectation will hang over them. Keep
everything the same, Torre will tell them. Play hard and
concentrate.

 By ANNE-MARIE SCHIRO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In a funny way, Alexander McQueen best represents the
attitude of the collections seen so far in London for spring and
summer 1999. His show on Sunday night was a combination of feminine
and brassy, of sexy and fragile. No other designer succeeded so
well in getting this dual message across.
</P>
<P>
   It's the old story that haunts the British fashion scene: a
wealth of talent and a paucity of financial resources. Designers
can put everything they have into making highly personalized,
sometimes even brilliant clothes and showing them on a runway, and
then find they are unable to produce the clothes and get them into
important stores. As a result, some have allied themselves with
foreign manufacturers and are turning out undistinguished work,
which they think has a better chance of succeeding in a global
market. But the exceptions make London worth the trip.
</P>
<P>
   McQueen, with a lucrative contract with the powerhouse LVMH-Moet
Hennessey Louis Vuitton to design for Givenchy, can afford to
indulge his creativity with both highly creative showpieces that no
real woman would ever wear and beautiful designs that anyone who
loves fashion would yearn for.
</P>
<P>
   So the showgoers seated in a grubby warehouse scented with
magnolia grandiflora candles were treated to seeing his tailored
frock coats with long tails worn over modified versions of his
bumster pants, Grecian-draped jersey dresses a la Mme. Gres,
delicate beauties in Battenburg lace tablecloth fabric, ruffled
Chantilly laces and embroidered fish net in a wide-ranging
collection.
</P>
<P>
   But of course, the frock coats were worn open over bare skin.
The tiered, ruffled laces like mambo dresses were sometimes shown
with stiff leather corselets or halters, which emitted intimations
of bondage. Many in the audience were unaware that one lovely blond
model in a molded-leather bodice over a ruffled skirt was a
disabled woman named Aimee Mullins wearing what looked like boots
but were actually carved wooden artificial legs designed and made
for the show.
</P>
<P>
   Who but McQueen could manage that and stir admiration for both
her courage and his? And there were concoctions like metal cages
over the models' heads and torsos; a halter and skirt made of bits
of colored mirror like those in disco globes; skirts that resembled
sandalwood fans; a garment with wings made of perforated slats, and
skirts folded like origami in stiff fabrics that stood away from
the body.
</P>
<P>
   The show was a tour de force, which ended with Shalom Harlow in
a white bouffant dress, spinning on a turntable like a ballerina on
a music box while being attacked by robotic arms that sprayed black
and blue paint onto her clothing and skin. It seemed the designer's
way of saying that beauty and innocence are fragile and in constant
danger of being destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Some designers start out with just one idea and elaborate on it.
McQueen's brain is an overflowing cornucopia of ideas, some
inspired, though not all of them endearing. Using unwearable
materials to make clothing is an aberration he shares with other
designers like Antonio Berardi.
</P>
<P>
   Berardi used wicker woven into openwork patterns like those on
Victorian garden furniture and molded into a bustier worn over
matador pants, which were trimmed with raffia fringe. There was an
even more unlikely skirt of wicker, not to sit on and certainly not
to sit in.
</P>
<P>
   His collection roamed all over time and place, with white
fencing jackets, sailor tops worn with A-line microminis, pert
white-eyelet-and-floral-chintz pieces, pastel leopard and peacock
prints with beading, flamenco dresses, capri pants, minimalist thin
white wool evening dresses adorned with huge African polished wood
bracelets worn all the way up the models' arms to their shoulders
and an enchanting crocheted camisole paired with a full flounced
skirt.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the outrageousness, there were enough real clothes to keep
retailers happy and Berardi in business.
</P>
<P>
   In the grand English artisanal tradition, Tristan Webber seems
to be less interested in selling clothes than in experimenting with
materials and cuts. For the collection he showed Sunday, he studied
with saddlers and tanners to learn techniques for working with
leather, which was used for the vast majority of styles in his
show.
</P>
<P>
   From former McQueen shows, Webber borrowed the notion of
inserting pieces of contrasting color or material into the leather,
often using multiple colors in a single design. A white leather
breastplate laced around the body was worn with a skirt of orange,
yellow, green and tan.
</P>
<P>
   There were also painted-on patterns, sexy cutouts, intricate
forms of lacing, additions of fur and snakeskin and a red
mini-dress with a ``sleeve'' of silver rings that extended down the
arm to end in a point over one finger. You couldn't help admiring
the imagination and skill that went into the collection, while
fearing that Webber will be hard pressed to find many customers.
</P>
<P>
   Julien Macdonald won worldwide acclaim by knitting clothing as
airy as cobwebs, as gossamer as dragonfly wings. Now, he's grown
tough. The collection he showed on Saturday night at 11 was more
like a wild party for his friends than a serious fashion show for a
professional audience.
</P>
<P>
   To a background of ear-splitting music interspersed with loud
honks like those in Marx Brothers movies, he presented thong
bikinis and evening dresses that seemed to be knitted of tinsel or
tinfoil; a corset trimmed with shells and flowers; shoes with
silver laces that went all the way up the leg to under the model's
panties; leggings styled like cutoff jeans; lots of sheerness, and
a bit of nudity when a model came out wearing nothing but
glow-in-the-dark tubes of yellow, red, purple and blue. The
designer's fans went wild.
</P>
<P>
   Every once in a while, a real dress appeared, but rather than
being knitted, it was beaded, usually in a geometric pattern. It
was a welcome sight.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Clements and Inacio Ribeiro are partners known for
making lovable clothes that women hold on to and add to each
season, especially their cashmere sweaters and peasant blouses.
This season's collection should reinforce the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The show started with dresses, tailored coats and jackets in
strong geometric, striped and city skyline patterns in shades of
gray or dark multicolors. The mood softened as the show progressed,
with loose peasant blouses over full skirts; sheer dresses over
solid slips; smocked velvets, and ethereal chiffon and lace dresses
with a vintage feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Betsey Johnson showed in London Monday for the first time, and
her individualistic spirit seemed a better fit here than in New
York, where a more classic mood prevails. She showed an exuberant
collection of colorful tutus and 1950s-inspired bouffant skirts
over petticoats; rompers and bodysuits; flamenco dresses, and black
lace matador-length leggings, all styled with oversize wigs,
sometimes entwined with red roses.
</P>
<P>
   Only a pre-adolescent could get away with wearing most of the
styles. But then, the music was sung in Spanish, and the collection
was called Cholita. It wasn't hard to make the connection to a
Latin Lolita.

Past failures 
against Boston 
add intrigue
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By ALAN TRUEX &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Asked which team he'd like to face in the first round of the
postseason, the Cleveland Indians' All-Star shortstop Omar Vizquel
said: ``Anybody but Boston. They've been really tough against us
all year.''
</P>
<P>
   So guess who's playing the Indians in the division playoffs?
Yep, Boston, which won seven of 10 games against Cleveland this
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox obviously match up well, but the Indians are the
more talented team when healthy. Trouble is, they're prone to every
sort of malady, from a blood clot in Steve Reed's right hand to the
broken bone in Jim Thome's, from the back spasms of Travis Fryman
and Doc Gooden to the spider bite of Brian Giles.
</P>
<P>
   By clinching the American League Central on Sept. 16, the
Indians could rest the weary and wounded. They staggered down the
stretch, losing six of their last seven games and almost blowing
their home-field advantage for the division series.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into _ or is backing into? _ the playoffs, manager Mike
Hargrove still wasn't sure of the state of his team's health: ``I
walked into the training room, and it looked like a Baskin-Robbins
where you take a number and wait your turn.''
</P>
<P>
   The main concerns are the back spasms that afflicted third
baseman Travis Fryman and pitcher Doc Gooden two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fryman, who hit 28 home runs, has a chronic pinched-nerve
condition, but it had never necessitated spinal injections until
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this guarantees I'll be ready by Tuesday,'' Fryman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden is 33 _ an old 33, with his lengthy history of arm and
drug rehabilitations. But he's throwing 93 mph and probably would
be No. 1 in the rotation if not for the back spasms.
</P>
<P>
   Another health issue is All-Star catcher Sandy Alomar Jr. He's
hobbled by a strained left knee that caused him to hit less than
.200 for the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, some favorable medical news pointing to an
Indian uprising in the postseason. The submariner Reed, one of the
game's most effective middle relievers, is healthy again, and
Thome, the starting first baseman on the All-Star team, appears
back in form after a month on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Thome's injury brought one benefit: playing time for rookie
Richie Sexson. A 6-foot-8 Randy Johnson-like stringbean, Sexson
cannot be overthrown at first base, and he hit so well as a fill-in
_ .313 with 11 home runs _ that he'll stay in the lineup, probably
at the expense of left fielder Giles, who hit 16 home runs as a
platoon player.
</P>
<P>
   Lost among the 136 homers of Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa was a
spree in which Manny Ramirez hit five in six at-bats and six in
three games, both feats being major league records.
</P>
<P>
   While Thome, Fryman, Ramirez, David Justice and now Sexton
provide wallop, Kenny Lofton terrorizes pitchers _ and sometimes
Hargrove _ with his brazen baserunning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a couple of times he's tried to steal third
base where if I'd had a gun, he wouldn't have gotten halfway
there,'' Hargrove said. ``But I'll take those mistakes along with
all the success he's had.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's weakness, as always, is a starting rotation that
lacks an ace. General manager John Hart steadfastly maintains that
premium pitching is overpriced, so he avoids it. Thus the Indians
have nobody to match Pedro Martinez of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland will open with 22-year-old Jaret Wright, who blossomed
in last year's postseason but faded in his sophomore season (12-10
with a 4.72 ERA).
</P>
<P>
   Gooden expects to be healthy for a quality start in Game 2.
Other possible postseason starters are Dave Burba, Charles Nagy and
Bartolo Colon, who combined for 44 wins this season.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove has a sixth sense for knowing when a starter is about
to get hot. He had a magical touch with Wright and Chad Ogea last
October. Colon, a 99 mph thrower who made the All-Star team but
slid in the second half, is an imposing candidate for postseason
revival.
</P>
<P>
   But first: Boston. Last year, the Florida Marlins roughed up the
Atlanta Braves in the regular season and continued to do so as
wild-card surprises in October. So Vizquel has reason to worry;
head-to-head records and any jinx the Red Sox hold on the Indians
cannot be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Red Sox have their own infamous Curse of the Babe
to worry about. The Buckner-blown '86 World Series, the
four-in-a-row fall to Oakland in the 1990 ALCS, the opening-round
sweep by Cleveland in '95 provide hefty emotional baggage.
</P>
<P>
   While the Indians have not won a World Series since 1948, they
have accumulated four division titles and two American League
pennants in the past four years. They are seasoned, talented and
deep. The only question is whether they're healthy enough.

 &HT;    Johnson, Brown square off in NL playoff
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ If, as he's been widely cast, Randy Johnson is the
hired gun brought in to put the Astros on the baseball map, then
it's time to play the role for real.
</P>
<P>
   The gangly left-hander, who has dominated National Leaguers
since being acquired just minutes before the Aug. 1 trade deadline
for a trio of prospects, faces the San Diego Padres and
right-hander Kevin Brown this afternoon in the opener of the
National League Division Series. Johnson is 10-1 with a minuscule
1.28 ERA since joining the Astros, providing a confidence jolt to a
club that won a franchise-record 102 games.
</P>
<P>
   Brown (18-7, 2.38) also knows the rent-a-player business, having
been dumped by the Florida Marlins in the fire sale orchestrated by
owner Wayne Huizenga after last season's World Championship. The
difference is that Brown went to spring training with San Diego,
and the franchise at least has sampled playoff success, although
it's only World Series appearance was a losing effort 14 years ago.
Ineptly, the Astros have not won a playoff series in their 35-year
history.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the move was made for the Big Unit, a free-agent this
winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like a hired gun, and right now I'm just thinking
about my start (today) and hopefully my starts following,'' said
Johnson, playing down his status on the eve of post-season.
</P>
<P>
   As for the pressure of starting Game 1, he said: ``If you don't
pitch a quality game, you put your team in a hole, and in a
five-game series it's not easy to dig yourself out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres hope to capitalize on Brown and fellow right-handers
Andy Asby and Joey Hamilton to neutralize the heart of the Astro
lineup, led by right-handed hitters Craig Biggio, Jeff Bagwell,
Derek Bell and Moises Alou.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the Astros lead the league in runs scored, and the
presence of Johnson would appear to give them an edge in the
series. The Astros and Padres rank second and third, respectively,
among NL teams in earned-run average, and Johnson said Monday that
only the Atlanta Braves might have a better overall pitching staff
than his new club.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the key is Brown, who like Johnson might possibly be
brought back to start Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Kevin Brown would make a difference in this ball
club,'' Padres manager Bruce Bochy said. ``I didn't know he'd make
this big an impact. He's as intense and tough a competitor as I've
been around. I'm sure Houston is saying the same thing about Randy
Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   In his only appearance against the Padres, while pitching for
the Seattle Mariners in late June, Johnson won 2-1 in San Diego and
struck out 12. Johnson fanned a combined 329 batters, most in the
majors since Nolan Ryan in 1977.

 &HT;    Reeves riled at secondary subs
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Twenty-four hours did little to soothe matters after
the Atlanta Falcons' 31-20 loss in San Francisco Sunday, and coach
Dan Reeves was perhaps more upset by his team's dismal first-half
showing after watching it on film.
</P>
<P>
   He was especially bothered by the play of the secondary. After
giving up 377 passing yards, the Falcons (2-1) are ranked last in
the NFL against the pass. Opposing quarterbacks have accumulated a
passer rating of 97.8, completing 73-of-111 passes (65.8 percent)
for 889 yards, five TDs and two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said third-year pro Juran Bolden and second-year pro
Michael Booker were the primary culprits Sunday. They play outside
in the nickel defense, while starting left CB Ray Buchanan plays
the slot and starting right CB Ronnie Bradford replaces strong
safety William White.
</P>
<P>
   Bolden was beaten for two touchdowns by Jerry Rice, including a
66-yarder on the second play of the game. San Francisco had 266
passing yards and 394 yards of total offense in the first half,
racing to a 31-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably a little bit more disappointed (after watching
film) because the intensity, the aggressiveness which (the 49ers)
came after us with in the first half was much greater than ours
was,'' Reeves said. ``They came into the game like they . . . were
the team with something to prove rather than us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our starters played pretty well; it was our subs that killed
us. We didn't do the things, Juran in particular, like re-routing
receivers . . . that we need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolden, one of the Falcons' fastest players, was no more than a
step away from Rice on the two TDs, but didn't make a play to tip
either ball away, or tackle Rice. Also, on the 66-yarder, free
safety Eugene Robinson simply missed a tackle a split second after
Rice caught the ball while crossing from left to right.
</P>
<P>
   ``That pass could have very easily been broken up,'' Reeves
said. ``At worst . . . Eugene's entry should have produced a hell
of a collision.''
</P>
<P>
   A sub-par pass rush that has generated but six sacks hasn't
helped. But the secondary is getting the most attention, as
Robinson also had a poor all-around game.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons don't have many options to make personnel moves.
Devin Bush, a starter last year at free safety, will end up the
backup at both spots, but he dressed Sunday for the first time
since spraining an ankle Aug. 14. He didn't play.
</P>
<P>
   In the nickel, one option might be moving Bradford outside, and
putting White or Bush in the nickel safety role.
</P>
<P>
   ``About the only (other) option you would have would be leaving
Ray outside and putting (reserve) Randy (Fuller) in (the slot),''
Reeves said. ``But (Fuller is) not 100 percent (because of an ankle
sprain).''

 &HT;    Falcons notebook
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Falcons did things differently Monday, reviewing
film much longer than usual, and with the whole team together.
Usually, defensive players and offensive players split up.
</P>
<P>
   The review took more than three hours, nearly twice as long as
usual. The secondary and the defense came under scrutiny after
Sunday's 31-20 loss at San Francisco, when the 49ers had 538 yards
of offense, and 377 in the air. But coach dan Reeves doesn't want
anybody thinking the Falcons' seventh straight loss in 3Com Park
was attributable to a single facet.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's message: all for one, one for all.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a team thing. You don't just play on offense, or just
on defense,'' said middle linebacker Jessie Tuggle. ''Football is
the ultimate team sport. When the secondary struggles, it's the
linebackers, too, and the pass rush. It was a low-key thing, a
teaching session. Nobody was raising voices or anything.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you sit with your peers, you want to play better. We're a
better defense than we showed. We have to work hard and improve,
and get ready to play Carolina Sunday. It all starts today.''
</P>
<P>
   Get going early
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons (2-1), whose wins have come against teams that are a
combined 0-7, have been outscored 42-7 in the first half while
outscoring opponents 42-10 in the second half. The Falcons
outscored San Francisco 13-0 in the second half, and outgained the
49ers 193-144. Reeves said that was misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ''The second half certainly wasn't the same intensity for
them,'' he said. ''We played better, but I don't think they played
as hard as they did earlier in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Right guard Gene Williams, however, wasn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite what anybody thinks,'' he said, ''they were playing
just as hard if not harder in the third and fourth quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   Reserve DT Esera Tuaolo has a torn left biceps, but it will not
require surgery. There's no word on his status for Sunday. . . . LB
Keith Brooking's bruised or strained quadriceps muscle also is a
concern. . . . Reeves said if LG Calvin Collins can't go (he left
the game after the first series Sunday with a re-aggravated ankle
sprain), rookie Bob Hallen will be the starter, not 10-year veteran
Dave Widell, who did not dress for Sunday's game. . . . Falcon
coaches this week will look hard at reserve LT Jose Portilla
(6-feet-6, 320 pounds) at right tackle, as Reeves said, ''We can't
keep getting one or two sacks at that position every week.'' . . .
. . . Falcon coaches said there were a minimum of five dropped
passes against the 49ers, four by wideouts. That does not include
tough-to-catch balls. . . . When San Francisco's Brentson Buckner
knifed past Williams to block Morten Andersen's PAT in the fourth
quarter, it ended a streak of 82 straight, dating back to 1995.

 &HT;    Packers' Holliday top rookie defender
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Justifiable or not, most of the early-season headlines involving
first-round draft picks have been generated by quarterbacks Peyton
Manning of Indianapolis and Ryan Leaf of San Diego. With the two
struggling passers meeting Sunday for the first time in a
regular-season game, the hype will be large.
</P>
<P>
   But for the first month of the season, Minnesota Vikings wide
receiver Randy Moss has been the most outstanding first-rounder on
offense. On defense the call isn't as obvious. Seven of the 14
first-rounders who are regular starters are on the defensive side,
and several demonstrated during the weekend they might be impact
players.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland cornerback Charles Woodson, who has been begging coach
Jon Gruden to let him play some wideout, frustrated Dallas' Michael
Irvin much of Sunday with his tight coverage. Arizona end Andre
Wadsworth, finally rounding into shape after missing camp in a
contract dispute, had two sacks. Linebacker Takeo Spikes of
Cincinnati and Jacksonville's Donovin Darius continued to make
plays.
</P>
<P>
   But Green Bay end Vonnie Holliday is the defensive rookie who
consistently has turned heads, and turned around offensive tackles.
The former North Carolina standout somehow fell to the 19th overall
pick in the April lottery. Packers general manager Ron Wolf, who
traded up in the first round to have a shot at UCLA safety Shaun
Williams, quickly changed gears when Holliday still was on the
board. In three games, Holliday, a college tackle playing at end,
has four sacks and has been stout against the run. Two weeks ago,
he chased Tampa Bay offensive tackle Jason Odom out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can talk about Reggie (White) being healthy, and that's
been huge for us,'' linebacker George Koonce said. ``But the rookie
really has solidified our front four.''
</P>
<P>
   False start, No. 25
</P>
<P>
   On a Sunday when wide receivers Terance Mathis of Atlanta and
Oakland's James Jett scored long touchdowns on weird deflections,
the wackiest incident actually was a penalty. The St. Louis
offensive line was flagged for a false start when the crowd at the
Trans World Dome abruptly erupted in a cheer as the blockers
settled into their stances. The reason for the ovation: A few
blocks away, Mark McGwire had just hit his 69th home run, and many
fans at the Rams-Cardinals game were listening to baseball on
transistor radios.
</P>
<P>
   Observation deck
</P>
<P>
   You do whatever it takes to win in the NFL, but a few Atlanta
players suggested after the loss at San Francisco that coach Dan
Reeves might have done too much. The Atlanta game plan was rife
with gimmicks: using Tim Dwight at tailback, flexing tight end O.J.
Santiago 20-25 yards, an onside kick by Morten Andersen and reverse
plays in the kick-return game that were not used. It is one of
Reeves' great contradictions that he wants to play physical
football but usually loads up on trick plays for big games. In
doing so, sometimes the statement you make to your own team is that
you don't believe it's good enough to beat the other guy by playing
it straight.
</P>
<P>
   Thin line
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers' offense is on a roll, but now faces its first speed
bump of the season. Starting left tackle Dave Fiore blew out a knee
Sunday and probably is gone for the season. After the victory over
the Falcons, coach Steve Mariucci claimed that rookie Chris Ruhman,
a third-round pick from Texas A&AMP;M who had been lightly regarded in
the '98 draft by most teams, would start. Lining up a rookie,
however, against Buffalo end Bruce Smith Sunday could be hazardous
to the health of Steve Young. So don't be surprised if Jamie Brown
gets the call. The 49ers traded a second-round pick to Denver for
Brown and projected him as the starter over Fiore. But Brown was
injured in camp, suffered an emotional meltdown and nearly quit
football.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tops
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to ignore the passing performances of Green Bay
quarterback Brett Favre (388 yards, five touchdowns) or San
Francisco counterpart Steve Young (387 yards, two TDs). But at age
35 and coming off two knee surgeries in the past year, wide
receiver Jerry Rice remains formidable. His 162 yards on eight
catches represented more yardage than six teams were able to
generate with their passing games.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive best
</P>
<P>
   Saints weakside linebacker Mark Fields benefits from the
aggressive defense of coordinator Zaven Yaralian, but his quickness
alone probably would make him a player in any system. In Sunday's
victory over the Colts, the fourth-year veteran had 13 tackles, two
sacks and a pass defensed, as Mike Ditka's team remained
undefeated.
</P>
<P>
   Truly special
</P>
<P>
   Roell Preston, a former Falcon, racked up 207 combined return
yards in the Packers' victory at Carolina. Those nose-bleed numbers
aside, the NFL's most electrifying return man might be Jermaine
Lewis of the Ravens. The miniature (5 feet 7, 168) wide receiver
had an 87-yard punt return for a touchdown. He is averaging 23.1
yards on punt runbacks and has three scores.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing . . . With tailbacks Errict Rhett and Jay Graham
having failed to deliver, Baltimore coach Ted Marchibroda
apparently sought a little divine intervention for his running
game. He got it in Priest Holmes, who rushed for 173 yards on 27
carries in his first NFL start. In his previous 10 games, Holmes
carried seven times for 26 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Stat stuff
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Redskins finished No. 30 against the run in 1996
and 28th in 1997, so general manager Charley Casserly spent $16.4
million in signing bonuses and salaries on defensive tackles Dana
Stubblefield and Dan Wilkinson. The results so far: In the first
four games in '97, Washington surrendered 568 yards on 124 carries.
In the first four games this season, the Redskins have allowed 640
yards on 131 rushes. Defensive coordinator Mike Nolan went to
Washington hoping it would be a springboard to a head coaching job.
At this point, the move looks more like a swan dive off the
10-meter platform and into an empty pool.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Vikings second-year veteran Dwayne Rudd, the former Alabama
standout who is becoming one of the NFL's best young weakside
linebackers, had his third straight game with 11 tackles. . . .
Road teams won nine of 12 games Sunday. . . . One week after
lamenting that coordinator Dick Jauron wasn't giving him any
pass-rush opportunities, Jacksonville linebacker Bryce Paup notched
his first sack. . . . Philadelphia signed wide receiver Irving
Fryar to a three-year contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   The last word(s) New Orleans quarterback Danny Wuerffel, on the
Saints' unaesthetic overtime victory at Indianapolis:
``Fortunately, they don't put parentheses with ``pretty' behind any
win. You just do what you have to do. That's been our philosophy.''

PANEL CRITICIZES SECRECY SURROUNDING WARREN COMMISSION REPORT ON
JFK'S DEATH
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There is no second gunman, no assassin skulking on
the grassy knoll, no vast conspiracy. But now more than 60,000
secret documents on the killing of President John F. Kennedy are
public records, released by a citizens' commission that concludes
its work on Wednesday after taking one of the deepest cuts ever
into official government secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   That commission, the Assassination Records Review Board, created
by Congress six years ago to dispel an abiding sense among
Americans that the truth about the Kennedy assassination had been
hidden, has since helped put more than four million pages of secret
records into the public domain, using unprecedented powers to order
declassification of documents.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, ``the official record on the assassination of
President Kennedy remained shrouded in secrecy and mystery,'' says
the board's final report, to be issued on Wednesday. ``The
suspicions created by government secrecy eroded confidence in the
truthfulness of federal agencies in general and damaged their
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   No one yet has read all the documents, some of which were still
being declassified over the weekend. Those already declassified
include the records of CIA and FBI surveillance of Lee Harvey
Oswald, a Marine who had defected to the Soviet Union and returned
to the United States, that was conducted well before his arrest on
the afternoon of the assassination, in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.
</P>
<P>
   The declassified documents also include previously unknown
original notes of Oswald's interrogation by the FBI and the Dallas
police after the assassination, statements from doctors who
performed an autopsy on the president, papers concerning a Pentagon
plot to blame Fidel Castro if the Mercury space capsule carrying
John Glenn crashed and documents dealing with a hundred other
subplots and loose threads for historians to weave.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing in the documents is likely to prove or refute the
conclusion of the Warren Commission, the panel of senior government
officials that determined in 1964 that Oswald had been the lone
assassin. The Warren Commission found no conspiracy in the
assassination, and none in Oswald's murder two days later in a
Dallas police station by Jack Ruby, a nightclub owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American public never trusted the commission's
conclusions,'' the report said, noting that there were reasons for
mistrust: the Warren Commission worked in secrecy, sealed many of
its records, misstated some evidence and was denied some facts. And
four of the commission's seven members later expressed some
skepticism about their own conclusions, the report notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got key things wrong,'' said Gerald Posner, the author of
respected books on the assassinations of President Kennedy and the
Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who believes that Oswald was a
lone assassin. ``They misstated the timing of the shots that killed
the president. They did not look aggressively at Ruby's mob
connections. The review board's work shows that the FBI did not
tell the commission key things. And of course the CIA was concerned
about its Castro war.''
</P>
<P>
   One member of the Warren Commission, Allen Dulles, director of
central intelligence from 1953 to 1961, never mentioned that
Kennedy had ordered the CIA to assassinate Castro. Some of the
agency's 33 plots to do so involved the Mafia. President Lyndon
Johnson, skeptical of the Warren Commission's findings, later told
an aide that Kennedy had been ``running a damned Murder Inc. in the
Caribbean'' and that Castro had killed him first _ another theory
never proved.
</P>
<P>
   The review board had five members: John Tunheim, a federal
district judge in Minnesota, the board's chairman; Henry Graff, a
Columbia University historian; Kermit Hall, professor of history
and law at Ohio State University; William L. Joyce, archivist at
Princeton University, and Anna Nelson, historian at American
University.
</P>
<P>
   They said in their report that ``30 years of government
secrecy'' surrounding the assassination had ``led the American
public to believe that the government had something to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress created the review board in 1992, reacting to Oliver
Stone's movie ``JFK,'' which presented a conspiratorial view of the
assassination that resonated with many Americans. Congress gave the
board unprecedented power to review and release secret records, and
that power set off a struggle to free the records from government
vaults.
</P>
<P>
   The board said it had confronted a Cold War culture of secrecy
that had not significantly changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government needlessly and wastefully classified
and then withheld from public access countless important records
that did not require such treatment,'' the report said. ``An
aggressive policy is necessary to address the significant problems
of lack of accountability and an uninformed citizenry that are
created by the current practice of excessive classification and
obstacles to releasing such information.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Change is long overdue,'' the report concluded. ``It is a
matter of trust.'' Making historical documents public, it said,
``is essential to maintaining our freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   One member of the review board, Ms. Nelson, said the guardians
of government secrecy had overstated their case that the release of
long-classified information could damage American national
security.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were always told that the release would be damaging,'' she
said. ``Releasing documents of 35 years ago has caused no
diminution of our intelligence ability, our foreign policy or
anything else. The sky has not fallen.''

 &HT;    Braves face most difficult journey yet
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The evolution works like this: The red-cheeked
overachievers become the big-armed powerhouse, which becomes the
grizzled campaigners. It's taken nearly a decade, but the Braves
have walked that story line through the 1990s, always at the
forefront, always favored.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only write that story so many times,'' general manager
John Schuerholz said. ``It's old.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly. Which introduces the final stage of the evolution that
befalls any team of even modest success:
</P>
<P>
   Vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   The League Division Series begins here Wednesday afternoon to a
different hum, and even if all the Braves don't admit to it, all
can sense it. It didn't matter whether Atlanta season ended in the
past six World Series: The Braves were the perennial favorite to
get there. This October dawns differently, and even Keith Lockhart,
who has been with the Braves just two seasons, feels the vibe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston played us pretty tough without Randy Johnson. San
Diego, the same way,'' Lockhart said. ``I think last year, most
people in this clubhouse looked at the NLCS more than they did the
Division Series. When we played Houston last year, it didn't seem
to matter how we played, but we beat them three straight and I
don't think there was anybody thinking we were going to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this year, it's going to be tough from the first game all
the way through. Maybe that's good, that everything's not focused
on us, that we're not supposed to win everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Astros won 102 games this year, the first time the
franchise cracked the 100-victory barrier, while Randy Johnson went
10-1 in the second half of the season. The San Diego Padres won a
franchise-record 98 and beat the Braves three times in five tries
in the last seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's playoff could just as easily spit out a team of
destiny as a fatigued wild-card winner. One way or another, the
National League has closed the gap on Atlanta this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``True, there are a lot more good teams this year,'' Greg Maddux
said. ``But every year, there have been good teams. My goal is to
get a ring. Getting to the seventh game of the World Series is not
enough for me, personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting to the seventh game might never be this difficult,
either. Atlanta could not get past wild-card Florida last season
and had to win the final three games of the NLCS the year before to
eliminate St. Louis. A statistical argument can be made that this
Braves team is the strongest Schuerholz has placed on the field.
But the October opposition has not stacked up like this before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Marlins posed a pretty big challenge last year, and they
beat us,'' Chipper Jones said. ``Teams every year, they go out and
try to better themselves in order to compete with us. That's pretty
flattering. Houston has pretty obviously gone to the head of the
class by acquiring Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of a bigger acquisition since I've been in pro
ball than that one. Maybe the impact Freddie (McGriff) had when he
first came over here (in 1993) is comparable. But for Johnson to go
10-1 in the second half and really propel them into being
contenders, a lot of people are paying a lot more attention to them
than they are us. And that's fine. We're probably a little tired of
always being the one people are gunning for.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones has endured that glare longer than most. The postseason
roster might include nine players who were not Braves in 1997 and
11 players who have never appeared in a World Series. For an annual
favorite, those are high rates of attrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all realize we're not the clear-cut favorites,''
said Tom Glavine, who along with Game 1 starter John Smoltz are the
only holdovers from the first playoff ride in 1991. ``Whether or
not that means anything, who knows? Whether that makes you feel
differently what's going on, I can't answer for everybody. The
spotlight is maybe not on us as it has been in years past. . . . I
don't feel any different.''
</P>
<P>
   And neither does the rest of the National League, which has
probably had its fill of Atlanta's run. That much is apparent
during the regular season, when Atlanta almost nightly brings the
best from every opponent. The Padres and Astros assured themselves
during second-half encounters that they can take the Braves.
Atlanta's 3-9 swoon a month ago made the rest of the league feel
the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask who you want to play in the playoffs. It really
doesn't matter,'' Lockhart said. ``If we're not playing well,
anybody can beat us. If we're playing well, we should be OK. But
every time, there seems to be an agenda to get a measure against
the Braves. If they don't do it this year, then it becomes an
agenda in the offseason. A lot of teams have done that now in the
National League.''
</P>
<P>
   And they're about to get their last best shot.

 &HT;    Achy legs hold up for Weiss, Lockhart
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A light, hour-long workout Monday yielded one piece of
essential Braves non-news: Keith Lockhart's right hamstring remains
healthy, while Walt Weiss' left quadriceps is still sound.
</P>
<P>
   Why the big deal? When Lockhart starts at second base and Weiss
at shortstop, the Braves are 42-16 this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no tweaks or anything,'' said Lockhart, who Friday
made his first start at second since Sept. 12, came off the bench
Saturday to play the last 3 1/2 innings against the Mets, then
started again Sunday and batted three times in three innings before
resting. ``I feel pretty good. I'm happy where I am.''
</P>
<P>
   That's back in the starting lineup against right-handed pitchers
for the NL Division Series, which begins Wednesday at Turner Field.
Back, too, is Weiss, who was plagued by chronic quadriceps problems
all season. After a Sept. 1 cortisone shot, Weiss had played in
just three games this month until starting all three last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss concedes he's still not churning at 100 per cent. ``I'll
probably be leery of going full speed,'' he said, ``but that's
something that when you're out there, you sort of sense where it's
at.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Weiss was encouraged by playing 21 innings over the
weekend and by two base-running plays in particular. He scored from
second Saturday on Chipper Jones' soft single to center; on Sunday,
Weiss scored from first on Lockhart's double in the right-center
gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a good sign going from first to home (Sunday),''
Weiss said. ``I ran fairly hard and didn't have a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Lockhart's hamstring problems might have helped heal
his lingering shoulder pain, and restore some of his power. He hit
his ninth homer Friday. ``That has a lot to do with the shoulder,''
Lockhart said. ``The leg was bad but it gave my shoulder time to
rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry &AMP; Ally
</P>
<P>
   Although he twice appeared in middle relief in last year's NLCS,
Kerry Ligtenberg now is the Braves' closer and technically still a
rookie. Yet he seems unfazed by the prospect of postseason
pressure. Ligtenberg is so nonplused about it that on Monday night,
he might have been one of the few folks in America _ and perhaps
the only baseball player _ who didn't watch the Cubs-Giants playoff
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who to root for and I'm not going to worry (about
who the Braves face),'' said Ligtenberg, the first NL rookie with
30 saves since the Cardinals' Todd Worrell in 1986. ``I'll be
watching `Ally McBeal.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Sliver Slugger
</P>
<P>
   While baseball awards the Silver Slugger to the best hitter at
each position, as voted by the managers and coaches in each league,
the Braves' starting rotation has its own in-house hitting
competition. Call it the Sliver Slugger. This year's winner, in a
remarkable last-day comeback: Greg Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux went 2-for-2 Sunday, with a double and a swinging-bunt
single that gave him 18 hits, one more than Tom Glavine; it also
raised his average from .219 to .240 _ .001 higher than Glavine's
.239.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I can always say I'm thankful he doesn't live here in
the offseason and we'd have to listen to him all the time,'' said
Glavine, who probably will win his fourth Silver Slugger award,
because the voting was done a few weeks ago. ``But I'm happy for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not one to boast about working somebody like a fish,''
Maddux said, ``so I'm not going to say anything.'' As for Glavine's
fourth Silver Slugger, Maddux deadpanned, ``We all know those
standards are tainted. It's like I've got one or two Gold Gloves
with asterisks.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves will hold another light workout today, at 1:30 p.m.
at Turner Field. . . . Game 2 Thursday will start at 8:15 p.m., not
8:07 as first announced.

'54 INDIANS COMPARE THEIR RECORD SEASON WITH THAT OF THE '98
YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Skedded earlier as BBA-YANKS-INDIANS) 
(JT) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Yankees matched the American League record of 111
victories set by the 1954 Cleveland Indians last Thursday. By
Friday, Bob Feller was hurling verbal heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't break any damned record,'' the 79-year-old Feller
said in a telephone interview. No longer a fireballer in 1954,
Feller still added 13 victories to the 65 amassed by the front-line
pitching of Bob Lemon, Early Wynn and Mike Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yankees' record is not legitimate,'' he said. ``It's
peaches and plums. We did it in 154 games. I've had it up to the
top of my head with this.'' Then he added: ``If you win the World
Series, you'll have something to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees, who finished with 114 victories, falter in the
post-season, they would repeat the Indians' startling fate in 1954:
win more games than any team in American League history, then lose
in October. The Indians' demise went quickly: four games to the New
York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Indians' peculiar luck to have their greatest season
in 1954, in the middle of a decade in which the Yankees won six
World Series. From 1950 to 1956, the Indians finished second to the
Yankees five times and won 92 or more games six times.
</P>
<P>
   Finally better than the Yankees in 1954, the Indians won the
pennant by eight games, although attendance was barely half the 2.6
million of 1948, when the Indians won the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's pitchers posted a league-leading 2.78 earned run
average and completed 77 games. Bobby Avila's .341 batting average
and Larry Doby's 32 home runs and 126 runs batted in led the
league.
</P>
<P>
   In their most torrid stretch, the Indians roared to a 26-6
record in August. So what sank the Indians in the World Series?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a time when a club gets so far out in front, you lose
your competitive edge,'' said Al Rosen, the Indians star third
baseman. ``That may have happened to us. Teams that go down to the
wire to win are normally sharper than clubs that clinch early.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Glynn, a backup first baseman to Vic Wertz, said, ``We won
it so early, but we went into a slump.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were overconfident,'' said Don Mossi, a rookie relief
pitcher. ``It was a long season. We changed. They changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Wally Westlake, an Indians outfielder, said, ``We got caught
with our pants down.'' He noted that the Indians feasted on losing
teams, but split their series with the Yankees and Chicago White
Sox, the second- and third-place finishers.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland split 44 games with the Yankees and Chicago, but took
75 from Boston, Washington, Baltimore and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always felt we were a good ball club,'' said Westlake, 77,
``but not a great ball club.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the 1954 Indians, the 1998 Yankees were potent enough to
steamroll through the regular season, but will the magic continue
in the playoffs? Forty-four years ago, the World Series was the
entire post-season. Now, the champion must win three series and 11
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they're not in the same situation,'' said Rosen, 74.
``They're an awful good team and they have the speed we didn't
have. Man for man, their lineup is probably better. But I don't
think any pitching staff was better than ours.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were not pushovers. They won 97 games and slugged 186
home runs; their 3.09 ERA led the National League. Johnny
Antonelli, Ruben Gomez and Sal Maglie combined for 52 victories.
But it was truly Willie Mays' team: he slugged 41 home runs and hit
.345 to edge his teammate Don Mueller for the batting title.
</P>
<P>
   And as the Indians would discover, the Giants had Dusty Rhodes,
a pinch-hitting machine, who hit .341 with 15 home runs and 50 RBI
in only 164 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could come off the bench with a cold jock and kill you,''
said Westlake, 77.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants had beaten the Indians 13 times in 21 games in spring
training in Arizona. But Westlake recalled that the Indians' 111
victories led fans and oddsmakers to underestimate the Giants, who
were managed by Leo Durocher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played for the Pirates against Durocher, and he had a way of
getting a team hyped up,'' he said. ``I didn't think anybody was
going to beat Durocher as a manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Mays and Rhodes devastated the Indians in Game 1. With the score
tied at 2-2 in the top of the eighth, Mays made a spectacular
over-the-shoulder catch of Wertz's drive to the deepest reaches of
the Polo Grounds with Rosen on first and Larry Doby on second and
no one out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd score, even though I'd been hobbling,'' Rosen
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians had a chance to take the lead. Glynn rued his
failure as a pinch-hitter in the top of the 10th with runners on
first and third. ``I had the greatest opportunity of my life and
blew it,'' said the 73-year-old Sussex, N.J., native. ``I struck
out. It was a golden opportunity that could have prolonged my
career. Next year, I was sold to Indianapolis.''
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the 10th, Rhodes pinch-hit for Monte Irvin with
Mays and Hank Thompson on base and responded with a 260-foot home
run to right field off Lemon to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the series was an anticlimax. Rhodes drove in two
runs with a single and a home run in Game 2 to lead the Giants to a
3-1 victory. Rhodes' success at the Polo Grounds _ Game 1's short
home run and Game 2's bloop single _ led Wynn to gripe: ``It's a
no-good ball park.''
</P>
<P>
   Games 3 and 4 in Cleveland brought the Giants their first
championship in 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We blew four straight,'' Feller, who was bypassed for a Game 4
start, said. ``I didn't pitch in it, so I had nothing to do with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosen said, ``I just feel the Giants were a better team than
people gave them credit for.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their 114 victories _ two short of the major league
record set by the 1906 Chicago Cubs _ the low-key Yankees aspire to
another World Series title, rather than lamentations about
underestimating their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Mossi, 69, offered the Yankees a dishful of ballplayer's
bromides. ``Just go out and play hard,'' he said. ``That's all you
can do. Tomorrow will take care of itself.''

Associated PressDavid Wells will be the Game 1 starter for the
Yankees.Rotation's late-season swoon 
makes Yankees look vulnerable
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By ALAN TRUEX &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW YORK _ At the time of the July 31 trade deadline, the New York
Yankees were so deep in pitching that few second-guessed them for
not making the top bid for Randy Johnson, who was traded from
Seattle to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson insisted last week that George Steinbrenner and his
minions did the right thing by doing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yankees getting me would have been like Bill Gates winning
the lottery,'' he said. ``Why would the Yankees need a pitcher like
me when they have a handful of fine starting pitchers already?''
</P>
<P>
   But as the postseason drew near, skeptics were putting a
different spin on the Yankees' rotation. David Cone, Andy Pettitte
and David Wells were losing their sharpness, and, gee, there might
have been a spot for Johnson after all.
</P>
<P>
   So despite winning an American League-record 114 games, the
Yankees begin the playoffs without the aura of invincibility they
had a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Being in New York, with the ever volatile Steinbrenner as their
owner, they are under extraordinary pressure. Steinbrenner has
taken the position that ``we haven't won anything yet.'' Anything
short of a World Series championship will not be acceptable to him.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Bernie Williams said: ``It's been an overall
special year for us. We're enjoying it, and we're not taking it for
granted. However, we're looking toward higher goals.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees won only 22 of their last 40 games, but they closed
out the season on a 10-2 stretch that began after the usually
easygoing manager Joe Torre delivered one of his few
tongue-lashings after a sloppy loss to Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played well since then,'' Torre said. ``This is as good
as we've played all year. You want to go into the playoffs feeling
good about yourself, and we're feeling pretty good about ourselves
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   He could take some reassurance in Cone and Pettitte closing out
the regular season with effective performances.
</P>
<P>
   There is still some concern about Wells, who has been undergoing
back therapy and has not been at his best in his recent starts. But
Torre felt confident enough to assign him the postseason opener.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are solid favorites against the Texas Rangers in the
division series. New York had an 8-3 advantage this year against
the winners of the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the rotation, the Yankees have few major questions.
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen has steadied with the return to health of sidearming
setup man Jeff Nelson, although Torre observed that he ``needs to
get sharper.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramiro Mendoza (10-2, 3.28 ERA) and lefties Graeme Lloyd (3-0,
1.78) and Mike Stanton are stalwarts who have been especially tough
in the postseason. Mariano Rivera (3-0, 1.91, 36 saves) is one of
the game's most reliable closers.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees average a league-leading six runs per game, and
there's so much depth that the team can withstand individual
slumps. Nine Yankees hit at least 10 home runs this season.
</P>
<P>
   New York is also solid in the field, ranking third in the league
with a .984 fielding percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, this is a team almost without flaws, held together by a
manager who was fired in St. Louis for not being able to motivate
his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I left St. Louis, I really soured on baseball,'' Torre
said. ``I felt violated when people were saying, 'Now we're going
to get more out of this team.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody can say Torre didn't get everything possible from this
year's Yankees. But he also realizes it will amount to little if he
doesn't end up fitting another World Series ring to his hand.
</P>
<P>
   An unsettling historical note: Those 1954 Cleveland Indians, who
set the previous AL record for wins at 111 (in 154 games), were
swept out of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be very disappointed,'' Torre said, ``if this record is
the only thing we have to look back on.''

HYDE MAKES SOME CONCESSIONS TO JUDICIARY COMMITTEE DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for addition; final 11 grafs are new.)  
 (ATTN: Ill., Fla., Mich., N.Y., Mass., N.J.)  (lh) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee acceded to an array of Democratic demands Monday, saying
he wanted to eliminate contentious side issues and keep his
committee focused on whether President Clinton should be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Asserting ``we are doing our level best to be credible,'' Rep.
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said he would dispatch a bipartisan team of
investigators to the office of Kenneth Starr to examine materials
the Whitewater independent counsel has not sent to Congress.
Democrats said last week that they wanted to see whether Starr had
held back any exculpatory information about Clinton's relationship
with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In another bow to the Democrats, Hyde said at a news conference
that he has instructed Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., to convene a
subcommittee hearing as soon as possible to examine precedents on
what qualifies as an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   And seeking to put several other issues to rest, he said the
committee would meet in public session next Monday when it votes on
whether to ask the House to let it open a full impeachment inquiry.
Hyde said he would vote to open such a formal impeachment
investigation. ``I should think there is enough to warrant an
inquiry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that he would support giving the senior Democrat on
the committee, Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the power to issue
subpoenas on his own if the House authorizes an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde made his announcement as Congress faced an uncertain
political environment five weeks before the midterm elections, with
polls showing that a majority of the public wants to see the
president punished but not impeached for his affair with a White
House intern and his denials about it. The Illinois Republican
emphatically sought to defend the committee against continuing
Democratic charges of partisanship, which he said were designed to
divert attention from the president's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to keep focused on our mandate,'' Hyde said.
``The Democrats would like to make Starr the issue. They would like
to make process, procedure, Peter Rodino, Mark McGwire _ they'd
like to make a lot of things the issue other than what we're
looking at.'' Peter Rodino, the New Jersey Democrat who presided
over the impeachment hearings of President Richard Nixon in 1974,
has been cited recently as a model of impartiality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing our level best to be credible,'' Hyde said. ``If
we aren't credible, what we do amounts to nothing. We understand
that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Press Secretary Mike McCurry said:
``Certainly actions are more important than words. But the
reassurances given by the chairman today were welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee were more
critical, insisting that the full committee, not a subcommittee,
should be deciding what is an impeachable offense. They also
complained that they themselves wanted to see Starr's extra
materials and not delegate the staff to review them.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are concessions, no question,'' said Rep. Barney Frank,
D-Mass.. ``But it's still not bipartisanship.'' Rep. Jerrold
Nadler, D-N.Y., said the Judiciary Committee should first be
determining what is an impeachable offense before voting on whether
there should be a formal impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Conyers took to the House floor Monday night to complain that
Hyde was making unilateral policy. ``Henry Hyde, you cannot
dictate,'' he proclaimed, ``You cannot do it. Neither can I.
Neither can the speaker.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, emboldened by his rising job approval
ratings, began late last week to assail the Republican Congress for
putting ``partisanship over progress, politics over people.'' And
James Carville, Clinton's 1992 campaign strategist declared on
television on Sunday that he was going into ``battle against Newt
Gingrich.''
</P>
<P>
   Carville said, ``This entire thing has been under the
orchestration, supervision and direction of Newt Gingrich and Ken
Starr.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats themselves are trying to move carefully,
afraid that too pointed criticism of the Republican majority in
Congress could backfire and make it impossible to reach eventual
accord on some punishment for the president short of impeachment.
Some congressional Democrats expressed concern that Clinton allies
were becoming too strident and treating the impeachment process
like another campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Carville overdoes it,'' Frank said. ``It would be
wrong for any Democrat to forget that the president's mistakes are
part of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Judiciary Committee will release another 3,000
to 5,000 pages of transcripts and evidence sent to Congress by
Starr, including the heavily edited transcripts of Linda Tripp's
tape recordings of her conversations with Ms. Lewinsky, her former
coworker at the Pentagon. Those tapes led Starr to open his
investigation into the president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
Edited copies of the actual tapes will also be released, probably
next week after editing and duplication have been completed.
</P>
<P>
   Having come under criticism for putting salacious materials into
public view, this time the committee has been far more selective in
what it is releasing, with the 3,000 to 5,000 pages to be made
public constituting only a fraction of the approximately 50,000
pages of evidence still in the committee's hands. Hyde said the
materials that are being safeguarded refer to national security
information, continuing criminal investigations or else are
salacious or abridge the privacy of third parties who are not
material to the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   After the new release of information, the committee moves to the
next phase of its inquiry. Hyde said that on Monday the committee
will hear from senior committee investigators _ David P. Schippers
for the Republicans and Abbe D. Lowell for the Democrats _ on the
significance of the evidence and then vote on whether to recommend
that the House authorize a full impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee is one of the most ideologically
polarized committees in the House, and the vote could very well run
closely along party lines. Asked if it would be a sign of
partisanship if only Republicans vote in favor of opening an
investigation, Hyde said, ``Yes, I think the Democrats, by not
voting to even go further with an inquiry, would show a
partisanship that I would regret.''
</P>
<P>
   When the full House decides whether to vote later next week to
open an impeachment inquiry, more Democrats are expected to support
a full impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   In another development Monday, Judicial Watch, a conservative
group, forwarded its own report to the Judiciary Committee and
cited a wide array of actions by Clinton that it considered
impeachable.

TEACHER, PUPIL, AND NOW RIVALS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mariano Rivera was casually answering questions as he
sat at Yankee Stadium last Saturday, deflecting the idea that he
would be adversely affected by one pitch to the Indians' Sandy
Alomar Jr. in the 1997 American League Division Series and saying
that he was a superior pitcher now compared with last season. His
demeanor was stoic, not bombastic.
</P>
<P>
   But when Rivera was suddenly asked about John Wetteland, the
Yankees' closer rose from his chair and spoke more passionately.
Forget the aggravating end to last season. Rivera enjoyed being
quizzed about the bullpen of 1996, when he was the setup man,
Wetteland was the closer and the tandem helped the Yankees become
World Series champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wetteland, to me, was like my teacher,'' Rivera said. ``We've
kept the relationship going. We used to be teammates, but now we're
not. But we're still friends. I wish him the best. He wishes me the
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland ruled the relievers in 1996, in the bullpen and on the
mound. Remember how dominant that team was because Rivera and
Wetteland turned games into Little League affairs almost every time
the Yankees led after six innings? They were an intimidating pair,
the intense teacher with the fierce fastball who danced past danger
right up until Charlie Hayes squeezed the last out of the Series
and the skinny pupil with the rising fastball who made hitters look
as if they were armed with Wiffle Ball bats.
</P>
<P>
   Any 12-year-old knew Joe Torre's moves in 1996. Rivera in the
seventh and eighth innings and Wetteland in the ninth. Rivera
struck out 130 batters in 1072/3 innings; Wetteland saved 43 games.
</P>
<P>
   Before he pitched, Wetteland lorded over Rivera and the other
relievers with some quirky bullpen rules. Anyone who wanted water
had to ask Wetteland and call him ``Sir,'' or have the liquid
thrown in his face. Anyone who did not cheer when a run scored was
slapped on the head by Wetteland. The rituals kept the relievers
close, like a fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the silliest of games, it gives you closeness as a
unit,'' Wetteland said.
</P>
<P>
   Torre said: ``I always respected what John did for us. He was an
inspirational leader. He took the ball any time. It didn't have to
be a save situation. That's one thing that I think Mariano learned
from him.''
</P>
<P>
   The teacher and the pupil parted when Wetteland signed a
four-year $23 million deal with the Texas Rangers two months after
he was the most valuable player for saving all four World Series
victories. Rivera did not duplicate Wetteland's post-season success
of 1996 a year ago and will try to alter that starting against
Wetteland and the Rangers in the division series opener Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the teacher actually considered the pupil a teacher,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always held that our relationship was reciprocal,''
Wetteland said. ``Mariano, whether he realizes it or not, probably
taught me as much as I ever taught him.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland watched Rivera's no-nonsense approach of buzzing
fastballs for 9 out of 10 pitches, and it reaffirmed for him ``the
effectiveness of a mid-90s fastball.'' Instead of dabbling with
other pitches, Wetteland emulated Rivera and unleashed heat. Rivera
revealed that the most important thing Wetteland taught him was not
to lose on a slider, his second-best pitch. If a hitter was going
to defeat Rivera, Wetteland instructed him, let him swing at the
fastball. That is actually how Alomar connected off Rivera for a
game-tying home run in Game 4 of last year's division series, a
game the Yankees ultimately lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were kind of teachers for each other,'' Rivera said. ``We
always talked about baseball and different situations. I liked
doing it because I learned a lot from him.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Yankees roared to 114 regular-season victories, even
Torre conceded that Rivera was overshadowed because it was
difficult to remember a tough save he had to collect. Rivera said
there were ``a few good ones,'' but admitted that most of his 36
saves were routine. Wetteland saved 42 games for Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Rivera tried to minimize 1997, he will be reminded
about Alomar's homer because the Yankees were only four outs from
advancing to the league championship series. Wetteland knows the
feeling. He was so undependable in the 1995 division series that
Buck Showalter, the manager then, used Jack McDowell as the closer
in a memorable loss to Seattle in the decisive fifth game.
Wetteland was asked how Rivera could conquer those ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's good that it's still in his mind,'' Wetteland said.
``In '96, I certainly did pitch with the memory of '95. With him,
it might be different. Maybe he has different ways of handling
things. Maybe he doesn't. It remains to be seen how he can
perform.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera said that last October would not haunt him. ``It's in the
past already,'' Rivera said. ``This is '98, not '97. I'd make that
pitch again. You look at the pitch, he was lucky. I never expected
the guy to hit the ball like that. He would never do that again.
I'd like to face him any time.''
</P>
<P>
   And throw another fastball. Just as Wetteland would want him
to. &QL;

Stottlemyre 
gives Rangers 
a needed boost
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By BILL SULLIVAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
The role of the savior didn't really fit. It was uncomfortable at
first and downright miserable at times for a hired gun who mostly
misfired his first month on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy like Randy Johnson, he's in a league of his own,'' Todd
Stottlemyre says with a smile. ``The rest of us, I guess, are in a
different class.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Texas Rangers prepare to open the American League
Divisional Series against the New York Yankees tonight in the
Bronx, Stottlemyre will hope to be the next best thing.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to reverse the result of a 1996 Division Series meeting,
the Rangers will entrust the cause to a pair of unlikely heroes:
the son of the Yankees pitching coach and a 20-game winner who went
to spring training in search of a job.
</P>
<P>
   All manager Johnny Oates wants Stottlemyre and Rick Helling to
do is make the difference as the team with the worst record among
postseason players takes on the one with the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our starting pitching is better than it was when we played
them two years ago,'' Oates said. ``Hopefully that can get us over
the top this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the 1-2 punch that Texas brings to the table is a
little different than anything the Rangers might have expected when
all this began some six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, 33, came over from the Cardinals at the trade
deadline. A poor start in his new surroundings produced more
comparisons to Dennis ``Oil Can'' Boyd than to Roger Clemens as the
Rangers floundered in the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came over, there were a lot of expectations, and
I probably tried too hard,'' he recalls. ``The impression you want
to make is on your teammates, and I feel like I fell short.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they hung in there with me and I kept working hard, and I
guess it all ended well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just feels good to be part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Stottlemyre has been an integral part. When the Rangers
needed him most, the late summer rental _ he'll be a free agent
once the season is done _ finally paid off.
</P>
<P>
   In his last two starts, both against Anaheim, Stottlemyre went
2-0, giving up just one run in 15 innings. Just as importantly, he
set the tone as Texas took the opening game in each of the last two
series against the Angels and went on to win the last five
head-to-head meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pitched two of the most important games in this
organization's history back-to-back,'' Oates said. ``Those were two
pretty good outings in big-time situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Good enough to earn Stottlemyre the start in Game 1 against the
Yankees tonight, with father Mel, the New York pitching coach,
watching from the other dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be special,'' the son said. ``But pitching and getting
to this point in the season is special, regardless of where you're
playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The playoffs is a field of dreams, no matter where it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Helling knows a little about dreams, too. He has seen them
come true, but mostly from a distance.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, he was part of the trade that brought pitcher
John Burkett from Florida, a deal that turned out to be crucial to
the Rangers first AL West title. Last year, the Marlins shipped him
back to Texas prior to going on their World Series run.
</P>
<P>
   Helling got a ring for his part in Florida's championship
season. All things considered, though, he cherishes the current
experience more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like a part of that, but this is different,'' he said.
``I've been in the rotation all year. I've pitched more than 200
innings. I've done everything they've asked me to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's more gratifying, because I've helped the team
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the spring, when Helling had to contend with the likes
of Bobby Witt and Roger Pavlik to earn a spot in the rotation, such
gratification seemed unlikely, to say the least. Even now, the
fastball remains just average, and the ERA (4.41) isn't normally
the stuff of 20-game winners, but the Rangers ended up an
impressive 25-8 in Helling's starts, efforts generally marked more
by tenacity than sheer gift.
</P>
<P>
   In Anaheim last Tuesday night, he dominated the Angels for eight
innings as Texas took command of the division race for good. When
the West finally was won, no one enjoyed seeing the champagne flow
in Seattle more than a fellow who doesn't drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awesome,'' Helling said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Helling gets to go in Game 2 against the Yankees. Ideally,
he'll be pitching to give his team a 2-0 lead heading back to
Arlington. If not, the second most famous athlete from Fargo, N.D.,
(after Roger Maris) still expects to have the time of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the year, nobody picked us to win the
division,'' he said. ``Everybody picked Seattle, and anyone who was
left picked Anaheim. We had a lot of ups and downs during the year,
but we battled through it and ended up in first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Another uphill battle awaits against a Yankees team that spent
much of the season being compared to the all-time greats and ended
up winning an AL record 114 games.
</P>
<P>
   A mismatch? Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, Helling promises, will show up anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not Nostradamus, but we've got a real good team,'' he
said. ``Once you get in the playoffs, you start from scratch. It
doesn't matter what you've done in the regular season.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the season, the Rangers would not have been inclined
to tout their starting pitching as an asset. Two of the five
regulars _ Witt and Darren Oliver _ no longer are with the team.
Burkett (9-13, 5.68) followed a disappointing 1997 season by being
even worse in '98.
</P>
<P>
   Down the stretch, however, the rotation suddenly came together.
Even Burkett righted himself, winning his last two starts and
giving up just two hits in eight innings in the final game of the
decisive sweep in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Oates hopes a short-term roll is more meaningful than a
season of uncertainty. After the two games in New York, he has
Aaron Sele (19-11, 4.23) set to face David Cone (20-7, 3.55) in
Game 3 in Texas and Burkett ready for Orlando Hernandez (12-4,
3.33) in a possible Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   Time for something completely different?
</P>
<P>
   ``This club here has notoriously been an offensive club, and the
pitching has always been a question mark,'' Helling says. ``I don't
think there's any question the starting pitching is key.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, it has been a positive for the Rangers. Oates hopes it
stays that way as his team carries a seemingly impossible dream to
the most storied venue in the sport's history.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good with a caveat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Momentum,'' Oates said, ``is as good as Stottlemyre pitches on
Tuesday.''

TOP IRANIAN REJECTS U.S. OVERTURE FOR NEW TIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Iran's foreign minister, Kamal Kharrazi, Monday
rebuffed the offer by the United States to draw up a ``road map''
to re-establish relations between the two countries, accusing the
Clinton administration of an outdated policy of hostility toward
his country.
</P>
<P>
   In a calm voice in a speech to the Asia Society, Kharrazi noted
a ``new tone'' toward Iran on the part of President Clinton and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that ``sole reliance on variation in verbiage can
simply not provide the necessary basis for an invitation to
political dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Kharrazi, a former representative to the United Nations who
earned a doctorate in education at the University of Houston, is a
close adviser of Iran's reformist president, Mohammed Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   The address was intended as an official response to Albright's
speech before the organization in June in which she called on Iran
to join in drawing up the road map to normal relations. But her
failure to offer any specific initiative or policy shift irritated
Iranian officials, who said there was no incentive to begin a
political dialogue with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Kharrazi reiterated that position Monday, making no effort to
disguise his displeasure at American policy toward Iraq and
reciting a litany of actions that he said indicated Washington's
``Cold War mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   The policies of the United States and its lack of commitment to
change are ``hardly compatible with the proposal to develop a road
map to change the state of affairs,'' Kharrazi said. ``This is
because there is no ground for political negotiations while these
policies continue.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration sent a number of senior officials to New York
to hear Kharrazi. They included Under Secretary of State for
Political Affairs Thomas Pickering; Martin Indyk, assistant
secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs; Wendy Sherman, a
senior State Department adviser, and David Welch, a Middle East
specialist and Indyk's chief deputy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did not offer a road map for the future,'' Pickering said
of the speech. But he said that ``the most important and
interesting thing is it is clearly a step forward to have the
foreign minister of Iran come to the United States and make a
speech'' that responded to the secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   Cyrus Vance, who was secretary of state in the Carter
administration and during Iran's 1979 revolution, said simply, ``It
was a very tough speech.'' Vance resigned as secretary of state
after the failed American military mission in 1980 to free
Americans held hostage by Iran's revolutionary government.
</P>
<P>
   Kharrazi made these criticisms:
</P>
<P>
   _ The United States lacks ``a commitment to international law''
because of its imposition of sanctions against Iran and dozens of
other countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
   _ The United States is ``retarding economic prosperity of Iran
and the region'' by its policy of obstructing the building of a
pipeline through Iran to ship oil and gas from Central Asia and the
Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   _ The United States is trying to ``sabotage'' Iran's efforts to
play a role in promoting regional stability.
</P>
<P>
   _ The covert program approved by Congress to destabilize Iran
and the recent creation of a Persian-language radio station ``to
wage a propaganda war'' against Iran are evidence of American
``interference in internal affairs of Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   Kharazi also criticized Albright for defending American support
for the late Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi in her speech to the Asia
Society as an ``attempt to justify the wrongful past,'' and blamed
the United States for the CIA-sponsored coup that restored the
monarchy in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Kharrazi defended what he called his country's war on drug
trafficking, its opposition to terrorism and its determination to
prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. But there was no direct
overture to cooperate with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pickering said that Kharrazi ``held the door open on a
number of subjects that are of great interest to us:
counter-narcotics, antiterrorism and weapons of mass destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration characterizes Iran as the world's most active
sponsor of terrorism, a developer of nuclear weapons and long-range
missiles and a violator of human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Kharrazi's speech was underwritten by the American oil company
Conoco, which was on the verge of signing a billion-dollar deal to
develop Iranian oil and gas fields when the Clinton administration
blocked it.

 &HT;    AL PREVIEW
 &HT;    By I. J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK VS. TEXAS
</P>
<P>
   _ When: At New York, today and Tuesday, 8:07 p.m.; at Texas,
Friday, 8:07, and Saturday, if necessary, TBA; at New York, Sunday,
if necessary, TBA.
</P>
<P>
   _ The records: The Yankees went 114-48, a league record for
victories, and finished 22 games ahead in the AL East. The Rangers
battled Anaheim all the season, finishing 88-74 and winning the AL
West by three games.
</P>
<P>
   _ The season series: The Yankees won 8-3.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pitching matchups: Game 1: Todd Stottlemyre (5-4) vs. David
Wells (18-4); Game 2: Rick Helling (20-7) vs. Andy Pettitte
(16-11); Game 3: Aaron Sele (19-11) vs. David Cone (20-7); Game 4:
Orlando Hernandez (12-4) or Hidecki Irabu (13-9) vs. John Burkett
(9-13); Game 5: TBA.
</P>
<P>
   _ The rotations: The Yankees will drop into a three-man rotation
of David Wells, Andy Pettitte and David Cone. The Rangers don't
really have an ace among pitchers Todd Stottlemyre, Rick Helling
and Aaron Sele.
</P>
<P>
   _ The bullpens: Mariano Rivera has been near perfect for the
Yankees with 36 saves and a 1.91 ERA. Most of the other relievers
have been inconsistent, but they have playoff experience. Rangers
closer John Wetteland (42 saves, 2.03) has had trouble recently,
but he was a World Series MVP _ with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   _ The offense: The Yankees scored the most runs (965) in
baseball, and center fielder Bernie Williams (.339) won his first
batting title. New York doesn't rely on the home run _ no player
hit more than 28 _ but finds ways to score. Statistically, the only
team in the league that can match up with the Yankees is the
Rangers. Juan Gonzalez had a monster season with 45 homers and 157
RBIs, and catcher Ivan Rodriguez led the team in hitting (.321).
Tom Goodwin (.290, 38 SB) has been a good leadoff hitter, and Will
Clark (.305, 23 HR, 102 RBIs) and Rusty Greer (.306, 16 HR, 108
RBIs) have had good seasons.
</P>
<P>
   _ The defense: Few teams can match the Yankees up the middle:
Derek Jeter at short, Chuck Knoblauch at second and Williams in
center. The Rangers' Rodriguez is the best throwing catcher in
baseball, and he will slow down the best running team (153 steals)
in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   _ Managers: New York's Joe Torre proved in previous postseasons
he can make the right moves. Texas' Johnny Oates lives and dies on
the bat of Gonzalez, and has had a hard time with his pitching
staff.
</P>
<P>
   _ The pick: The Yankees are just too deep and too strong
offensively for the Rangers, who finished with the third-worst ERA
(4.99) in the league. The only way Texas can win is to outslug New
York, and the Yankees are too experienced for that to happen.
Yankees in four.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND VS. BOSTON
</P>
<P>
   _ When: At Cleveland, today and Wednesday, 1:07 p.m.; at Boston,
Friday, 4:07, and Saturday, if necessary, TBA; at Cleveland,
Sunday, if necessary, TBA.
</P>
<P>
   _ The records: The Indians went 89-73, winning the AL Central
for their fourth straight division title and finishing 9 games
ahead. The Red Sox went 92-70, winning the wild card by four games.
Boston's record was the league's second-best behind the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   _ The season series: The Red Sox won 8-3.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pitching matchups: Game 1: Pedro Martinez (19-7) vs. Jaret
Wright (12-10); Game 2: Tim Wakefield (17-8) vs. Dwight Gooden
(8-6); Game 3: Bret Saberhagen (15-8) vs. Charles Nagy (15-10);
Game 4: Bartolo Colon (14-9) vs. Pete Schourek (1-3); Game 5: TBA.
</P>
<P>
   _ The rotations: Cleveland goes into the postseason with a
better pitching staff than last year's club, which made it to the
World Series. The top three will be Jaret Wright, Dwight Gooden and
Charles Nagy. Bartolo Colon made the All-Star team and might be
used in Game 4 but had a rough second half. Dave Burba (14-7) is
available. Pedro Martinez has been strong for the Red Sox but lost
his last three decisions. Tim Wakefield and Bret Saberhagen have
been productive but rarely keep opponents from scoring fewer than
three runs.
</P>
<P>
   _ The bullpens: Closer Tom Gordon (46 saves, 2.72 ERA) has been
a godsend for the Red Sox, saving a major-league-record 43 in a
row. Jim Corsi (58 appearances, 2.59) has been one of the best
setup men in the game. Indians closer Mike Jackson (40 saves, 1.55)
has been a big surprise. Lefty Paul Assenmacher (3.26) is having
problems getting out left-handed hitters.
</P>
<P>
   _ The offense: The Indians have had better offensive clubs, but
there are few holes in the order and plenty of power, especially
with the way Manny Ramirez (.294, 45 HR, 145 RBIs) played this
month. The key for the Indians could be to get a big series from
leadoff hitter Kenny Lofton (.282, 54 SB). Mo Vaughn (.337, 40 HR,
115 RBIs) and Nomar Garciaparra (.323, 35 HR, 122 RBIs) carry most
of the weight for the Red Sox, while the rest of the batting order
is made up of role players. Leadoff hitter Darren Lewis (.268, 29
SB) has to set the table.
</P>
<P>
   _ The defense: Cleveland's infield is as good as any, especially
with Omar Vizquel at short, and Sandy Alomar is strong behind the
plate, although his offense has dropped (.235, 6 HR, 44 RBI).
Garciaparra had trouble defensively in September, but this team is
filled with players who can make run-saving plays.
</P>
<P>
   _ The managers: With every October, Cleveland's Mike Hargove
gets better and better. Boston's Jimy Williams gets his first
postseason with the Red Sox, but he got a taste of what it was like
when he was with Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   _ The pick: The Indians have all the postseason experience and
proved last year that they thrive in the underdog role. Boston
struggled in September and has a brutal history in October. Red Sox
in 5.

 &HT;    Yankees `start from scratch'
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark McGwire's big swing overshadowed everything in baseball
this season, but the New York Yankees have been almost as
mind-boggling.
</P>
<P>
   The club they are calling the new Bronx Bombers won an amazing
114 games, an American League record and eight more than the
Braves, the team with the best record in the National League. The
Yanks are 66 games over .500 and 27 games better than their playoff
opponent, the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   But to hear the Yankees, who had the AL East essentially won by
mid-summer, they already have put the regular season out of their
minds. ``When Tuesday comes, we start from scratch,'' manager Joe
Torre has told them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking toward higher goals,'' center fielder Bernie
Williams said. ``We know we have a lot ahead of us.''
</P>
<P>
   New York, which hosts a good-hitting Texas club in the opener of
a best-of-five series tonight, would do well to heed that advice,
because great records in the past certainly haven't guaranteed a
World Championship.
</P>
<P>
   The 1906 Cubs, who went 116-36, still hold the record for most
wins, but they lost to the crosstown White Sox in the World Series.
The 1954 Indians had held the AL mark for the most wins with 111
but were swept in the Series by the New York Giants. In 1969, the
Orioles won 109 games and lost 53, but the Mets won four out of
five in the World Series. And most recently, in the
strike-shortened regular season of 1995, the Indians went 100-44,
the best winning percentage (.694) in the major since 1954, but
Cleveland lost to the Braves in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   During the '90s, the team with the best record each year has yet
to become world champions. ``The first round always scares me,''
Torre said. ``I felt good last year with a 2-1 lead.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees went on to lose the next two games and the AL
Division Series to the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   However, this Yankees team might be special, one that doesn't
squabble in the clubhouse, one that hasn't felt the wrath of owner
George Steinbrenner, one that turned in one great accomplishment
after another. Williams won the batting title, David Wells threw a
perfect game, David Cone won 20, and Scott Brosius, batting ninth,
drove in 98 runs after bringing home 41 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are pretty awesome,'' said Expos manager Felipe Alou, who
has seen his share of great teams in 40 years in the majors. ``They
can beat you a bunch of different ways, and I don't even think they
had anybody hit more than 30 homers.''
</P>
<P>
   The individual high was 28, by Tino Martinez. New York, with so
many weapons, did not rely on the long ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't sit here and say they are weak in this area or weak
in that area, because they aren't,'' Tampa Bay pitcher and former
Yankee Dave Eiland said. ``You'd be hard pressed to find a
weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   So how do you beat the Yankees? With Mariano Rivera closing,
they were 102-1 when leading after eight innings. If starters
Wells, Cone and Andy Pettitte aren't enough, they have Orlando
Hernandez and Hideki Irabu and even Ramiro Mendoza, who was moved
to the bullpen earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Most teams are either top-heavy with right-handed or left-handed
hitters. Not true for the Yankees. Williams and catcher Jorge
Posada are switch-hitters. For a right-handed bat off the bench,
they've got Chili Davis; for left-handed, they've got Darryl
Strawberry. No team in baseball has better platoons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have one big guy,'' said Tim Raines, another Yankee
weapon. ``We have a team of big guys.''
</P>
<P>
   New York also is playing great baseball as it goes into the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 16, after the Yankees had lost 16 of 28, including that
day's 7-0 loss to expansion Tampa Bay, Torre shut the clubhouse
doors. ``That was awful,'' he screamed. ``We stunk.'' The message
sunk in. New York won 10 of its last 12.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Yankees are wary of the Rangers, led by Juan
Gonzalez, whose 157 RBIs were the most in the AL since 1949.
Gonzalez typically kills the Yankees, hitting .326 against them
this year with four homers and 12 RBIs. Overall, Texas scored 940
runs, second to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't win the West the way the Rangers did and not feel
good about yourself,'' Torre said. ``They beat the team they had to
beat, the Angels, five straight times. That's pretty impressive.''

   HOUSTON VS. SAN DIEGO
</P>
<P>
   _ When: Today at Houston, 4:07 p.m.; Thursday at Houston, 4:07
p.m.; Saturday at San Diego, TBA; Oct. 4 at San Diego, TBA; Oct. 5
at Houston, TBA.
</P>
<P>
   _ The records: For the first time in franchise history, the
Astros won 100 games, finishing with 102 and winning the Central by
13 games. The Padres went 97-64, winning their second West title in
three years _ nine games ahead in the division.
</P>
<P>
   _ The season series: The Astros won 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pitching matchups: Game 1: Kevin Brown (18-7) vs. Randy
Johnson (10-1); Game 2: Andy Ashby (17-9) vs. Shane Reynolds
(19-8); Game 3: Mike Hampton (11-7) vs. Joey Hamilton (13-13); Game
4 and 5: TBA.
</P>
<P>
   _ How they match up _ Rotation: Everything changed for the
Astros when Randy Johnson was acquired from Seattle on the last day
of July. Johnson was 10-1 with the Astros, and his confidence
seemed to spill over to the rest of the staff. Johnson has plenty
of support from Shane Reynolds, Jose Lima (16-8) and Mike Hampton.
San Diego's Kevin Brown proved last October that he can carry the
day in a big game. Andy Ashby has struggled during September and
Joey Hamilton sometimes can't find his control. Sterling Hitchcock
(9-7) is available if a left-hander is needed.
</P>
<P>
   _ The bullpen: Houston closer Bill Wagner (30 saves) can be
awesome at times. The Astros have very good setup men, including
Bob Scanlan, Doug Henry and Jay Powell, all with ERAs of less than
3.10. No closer has been better than San Diego's Trevor Hoffman,
who saved 53 and shortens the game to eight innings. Randy Myers,
Donne Wall and Dan Miceli stabilize the rest of the pen.
</P>
<P>
   _ Catcher: Houston's Brad Ausmus has knocked in some big runs
and has been consistent on defense. San Diego could not ask for
more from catcher Carlos Hernandez, who has brought stability to
the position.
</P>
<P>
   _ First base: Houston's Jeff Bagwell has not had his best season
but hit .304 with 33 homers and 111 RBIs. He's a strong performer
who wants to make up for last year's playoff bust, however. Wally
Joyner has had a solid year for the Padres, hitting .298 with 12
homers and 80 RBIs. But he can't carry a team the way Bagwell can.
</P>
<P>
   _ Second base: Aside from Sammy Sosa, Craig Biggio of the Astros
might be the league MVP. Biggio became only the second major
leaguer, joining Tris Speaker, to collect 50 doubles and 50 stolen
bases. He is hitting .325 and has been thrown out trying to steal
only eight times. San Diego's Quilvio Veras is a solid player who
hits well in the leadoff position. He has 24 steals bases and is
strong defensively.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shortstop: Houston's Ricky Gutierrez had a career year with 46
RBIs. He has good range and his defense is consistent. San Diego's
Chris Gomez has been inconsistent. He is not a strong hitter and
his defense is erratic. But he can turn the double play.
</P>
<P>
   _ Third base: Sean Berry and Bill Spiers, who share the position
for the Astros, combined for 95 RBIs. Both play good defense. It's
been a strange season for San Diego's Ken Caminiti. At times he's
looked like the old MVP, but for the most part has struggled,
hitting .252. He's had trouble with back problems.
</P>
<P>
   _ Left field: Moises Alou, with 124 RBIs, has been a great
clutch player for Houston. San Diego's Greg Vaughn is this team's
MVP with 50 homers and 119 RBIs. He is a major the reason the
Padres are in this position.
</P>
<P>
   _ Center field: Houston's Carl Everett has lived up to his
billing with 15 homers and 76 RBIs. Steve Finley of the Padres has
had better seasons; he's hitting .249 but still covers a lot of
ground.
</P>
<P>
   _ Right field: Houston's Derek Bell is hitting .314 with 22
homers and 108 RBIs. San Diego's Tony Gwynn has proved he's not
over the hill, hitting .321, but has struggled with injuries. This
might be his last chance for a World Series ring and that's enough
incentive to play with pain.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bench: Young outfielder Richard Hidalgo and pinch-hitting
specialist Dave Clark have helped the Astros. The bench is a
strength for the Padres _ backup catcher Jim Leyritz proved in the
1996 World Series against Atlanta that he can play big in October.
Few pinch hitters are better than John Vander Wal, hitting .279
overall.
</P>
<P>
   _ Manager: Larry Dierker had no problem making the transition
from announcing booth to dugout. He got his club in the postseason
last year but had little to battle with against the Braves. Now, he
has the players and has earned his pitchers' trust by allowing them
to pitch through the tough innings. San Diego's Bruce Bochy has had
to deal with injuries all season, but he has done a good job of
keeping this team out of major slumps.
</P>
<P>
   _ The pick: Except for the Yankees, no one is better balanced
than the Astros. They can win with the homer and manufacture runs
if the homer isn't happening. Houston leads the league in runs
scored (874) and was second in average (.280). The Padres did not
play well the final month of the season, but it might have been
boredom. On paper, each team has a lot of strong points. But the
difference is the Big Unit. Astros in 4.

GILLETTE TO CUT WORK FORCE AS RESULTS LAG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   (af)  
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Warning that its third-quarter results would be dismal, the
Gillette Co. said Monday that it would cut 4,700 jobs, or 11
percent of its worldwide work force, as it reorganized its
business.
</P>
<P>
   The company, the world's largest maker of blades and razors,
said earnings for the quarter would be down 20 percent from the
quarter a year ago, largely as a result of a $535 million charge
against earnings to pay for the cutbacks and reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said they were surprised by how bleak the earnings
outlook was. Gillette was expected to earn 40 cents a share in the
third quarter ended Sept. 30, based on a consensus of analysts
polled by First Call, an investment research company, compared with
38 cents a share, adjusted for a stock split, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette also said it expected to report a decline of 6 percent
to 7 percent in revenue for the quarter, from $2.4 billion a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette plans to close 14 plants and 12 warehouses and
eliminate or consolidate about 30 office facilities worldwide. The
company, which is based in Boston, did not say which plants and
offices would be closed. The cost cuts, which are part of the
company's second reorganization in five years, will result in
annual savings of more than $200 million, with a third of that
coming next year and the balance by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said its earnings would grow by the ``low
double digits'' in the fourth quarter, but it had expected to earn
41 cents a share, based on the First Call consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette announced the profit warning and the cutbacks after the
stock market closed. Earlier, its shares rose $1.6875, to $40, on
the New York Stock Exchange. Third-quarter results are scheduled to
be released on Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Calling it a ``very poor quarter we'd like to forget,'' Alfred
M. Zeien, the chairman and chief executive officer of the company,
said the results could be attributed to several factors.
</P>
<P>
   First, the company's strategy to accelerate the introduction its
new Mach 3 shaving system resulted in huge one-time costs. At the
same time, Zeien said, consumers have been stocking up on the new
razor, which was sold with at least a month's worth of blades, and
many have not yet had to purchase replacements. In addition,
economic instability in some countries has hurt wholesale demand
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with financial analysts Monday, Zeien
sought to assure investors that the fundamentals of Gillette's
business remained strong and that the Mach 3 shaver was meeting
sales expectations. He also assured analysts that the
reorganization would bring about a more competitive company.
</P>
<P>
   The changes, Zeien said, ``will allow Gillette to become a more
cost-effective competitor, help Gillette to achieve its aggressive
strategic plans, recapture the sales and earnings growth momentum
and enhance the company's ability to improve shareholder return.''
</P>
<P>
   But the assurances did little to pacify analysts, who said they
had not been expecting an earnings drop of as much as 20 percent
and had little warning from Gillette's management that estimates
were so far off target.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a lack of information over the last quarter,''
said William Steele, who follows the company for Buckingham
Research. ``Basically I think investors have been too optimistic
based upon the company's guidance.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the job cuts and factory closings, Gillette said
it was realigning its management. The company, which manufactures
the best-selling Sensor razor line as well as Duracell batteries
and Oral B dental products, said its six global business management
units would be organized under two executive vice presidents.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the consolidation of the commercial operations will
result in five geographic groups organized under two additional
executive vice presidents.
</P>
<P>
   The groups will sell the company's entire product line within
their geographic territories instead of having distinct selling
organizations with separate administrative functions in one
territory. The four executive vice presidents will report to
Michael C. Hawley, president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the new organization structure, there will be one
Gillette Co. in each of the major geographic regions,'' Hawley
said.

 &HT;    Weaker Georges dumps rain
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OCEAN SPRINGS, Miss. _ Hurricane Georges weakened to a tropical
storm after landfall Monday but continued to dump rain at an
average of an inch an hour over much of the Gulf Coast and was
blamed for at least two deaths in Louisiana and one in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday night, winds had dropped to just over 69 mph _ six mph
below hurricane strength _ from a high of 110 mph. New Orleans was
spared a catastrophic direct hit that many in the Big Easy had
feared after the storm turned eastward before coming ashore.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that New Orleans still could face substantial flooding,
Mayor Marc Morial refused to allow the more than 10,000 evacuees
sheltered in the Louisiana Superdome to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The remnants of Georges were expected to bring heavy rains as
far north and east as the Georgia mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of customers remained without electricity from
Pensacola, Fla., to New Orleans. About 230,000 customers were
without power in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   A man died Monday in a New Orleans fire started by candles after
the hurricane knocked out electricity. An 86-year-old woman died
while she and 250 other nursing home residents waited for beds in a
Baton Rouge, La., shelter.
</P>
<P>
   A fire late Sunday took the life of a Pensacola woman. Police
said the woman, Ruby Lee Pettiway, 66, is believed to have been
lighting a candle when her house caught fire. There was no power at
the time because of Georges.
</P>
<P>
   The Mississippi Gulf Coast braced for more torrential rains
after Georges caused widespread flooding in its broad, plodding
path.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is Georges has just been squatting here,'' said
Jim Pollard, a Harrison County civil defense official in Gulfport,
Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Some areas of coastal Mississippi had received more than 20
inches of rain, and the National Weather Service forecast another
20 to 30 inches as the storm moves slowly northward, Pollard said.
Pollard said flooding could linger for several days in bayous and
other low-lying areas, hampering efforts to restore power and
repairdamaged homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Civil defense officials urged people who evacuated to stay out
of storm-damaged areas because of dangers from flooding, fallen
trees and downed electrical lines.
</P>
<P>
   In Gautier, Miss., damage to businesses appeared extensive.
Steel I-beams holding up a Hardee's sign snapped. All that remained
of a red-and-yellow McDonald's sign was ``Mc.''
</P>
<P>
   Many billboards and highway signs on I-10 were knocked over.

 &HT;    Hearings on Clinton could be in October
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Members of the House Judiciary Committee signaled
Monday that the impeachment process would kick into high gear
almost immediately once the House votes to begin the formal
impeachment inquiry of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote is expected as early as Oct. 8, and Georgia
Republican Rep. Bob Barr, a Judiciary member, said he is expecting
hearings to start in October, earlier than some have anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois Republican Henry Hyde, the chairman of the panel
charged with overseeing any possible impeachment, said staffers
would begin the fact-finding stage of the process immediately
following the vote to authorize an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Republican members of the committee met behind closed doors
Monday afternoon to discuss the coming vote, and members said they
were unanimous in their belief that the impeachment inquiry is
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be awfully hard for someone to say we ought to fold
up our tent and go home,'' said Barr, who added that he is prepared
to be here past the Oct. 9 adjournment date for hearings. ``The
only question is, are we going to ignore this and put our head in
the sand?''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde also said the public could expect to see a mere fraction of
the remaining 60,000 pages of documents from the independent
counsel investigating the president. The committee whittled down
the final batch of documents to four banker boxes, less than 6,000
pages, out of concern for the privacy of innocent people and the
need to protect other ongoing criminal investigations.
</P>
<P>
   And in an apparent show of confidence, Hyde also announced that
he would send investigators from both political parties to the
offices of independent counsel Kenneth Starr to see if there are
any other documents relating to Clinton's adulterous affair with
Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Starr sent a 445-page report to Hyde's committee Sept. 9
alleging that the president committed perjury, obstructed justice
and abused his powers in trying to conceal his affair with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   A committee vote on a formal impeachment inquiry is expected to
take place early next week after a lengthy presentation of the
Starr evidence by Republican chief counsel David Schippers and
Democratic chief counsel Abbe Lowell. The matter will then go to
the House for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   With most Republicans on the 37-member committee saying they see
no choice but to support an inquiry, approval is likely. Hyde
declined to say how he would vote, but he did say he thinks there
is ``enough to warrant an inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee Democrats are expected to oppose the inquiry. While
most say they deplore the president's behavior, they also say there
is little evidence to warrant punishment as severe as impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats viewed Hyde's decision to send investigators to
Starr's office as a victory in their quest to ensure that any
impeaching proceeding is fair. Until now, Democrats have largely
lambasted the committee's considerations as a partisan attempt to
undermine and embarrass the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``House Republicans can see from public opinion polls that the
American public clearly and correctly perceives these proceedings
as highly unfair and partisan,'' said Jim Jordan, press secretary
to the Democratic side of the Judiciary Committee. ``I expect we
will see more backpedaling of this nature. As they've moved through
the evidence that Starr sent to the committee, it's increasingly
apparent that there were surprising omissions in the material
sent.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said the Democrats were trying to use partisan tactics to
deflect attention from the president's actions. The question, he
said, is a simple one: Do the allegations against the president
merit further investigation? Should the committee inquire further
into these allegations or refuse to take a closer look and just
shut down?
</P>
<P>
   Fairness, Hyde said, is what the future of the committee will be
about, not the partisan fights for which the committee has become
notorious.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing our level best to be credible,'' Hyde said. ``If
we aren't credible, what we do amounts to nothing. We understand
that and we're trying to be fair. ``

   Q: I received an anonymous letter, presumably from one of the
employees who reports to me, stating that another employee in the
group is slacking off, particularly when I am out of the office. I
consider the named person to be one of the better employees, and
I'm not sure what to do about the letter. W.H.

<P>
   A: In dealing with anonymous letters, which can run the gamut
from outright lies to downright truth, some managers take the
approach that if there is no signature, the letter can be ignored.
Other managers regard any written word as the gospel truth, and
jump right into the fray. Rather than such automatic responses, the
initial determinant of any action should be the content of the
letter itself.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of the letter you received, one initial step is look
for any possible reasons why an employee may have felt compelled to
send a letter in the first place, anonymous or not. Are there
adequate opportunities for the employees to openly express
themselves? And, looking specifically at the anonymous issue, is
there anything in the work environment indicating that there can be
reprisals as a result of the employees' comments?
</P>
<P>
   Whether you believe what's in the letter or not, its main point
is going to stay in your mind for a while, and you are probably
going to be more observant of the behavior of the named employee.
As you manage by wandering around, and occasionally manage by
dropping in, it should not take too long to determine whether the
letter is fact or fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I made a presentation in front of several members of senior
management, and many told me that I did very well. However, all my
manager said was that I did a ``pretty good'' job. This really
deflated me. Should I say something to him? J.C.
</P>
<P>
   A: Since you are deflated because your manager burst your
bubble, you should discuss the matter with him. However, before you
do so, there are a few pointers to remember.
</P>
<P>
   First, you obviously made a strong presentation, and the fact
that some topside managers observed it clearly decreases the
significance and impact of your manager's comments.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, is it possible that your successful presentation is
distressing to your manager? A strong manager would be very proud
if one of his or her employees performed well in this type of
situation, while a weak or insecure manager would be unnerved by
such a performance.
</P>
<P>
   It is also possible that your manager's feedback was off the top
of his head and he meant nothing disparaging at all. In fact, the
idea of being ``pretty good'' may be the highest form of praise
from him.
</P>
<P>
   At some point in the near future, you should meet with him to
discuss your presentation and tell him about the feedback that you
received from many topsiders. At the same time, let him know that
you are always interested in improving your performance and if he
felt there were some areas that could have been stronger, you would
like to hear what he has to say. He may have some pretty good
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The other day, one of the supervisors commented that she was
surprised that I showed up for work on time. I was shocked to hear
this, considering that none of the other supervisors &UR;  &LR; nor my boss
has ever commented on my being late. I always report on time, give
or take a minute. Was it appropriate for one supervisor to make
that comment? T.A.
</P>
<P>
   A: It sounds like this supervisor's comments were inappropriate
and, more importantly, inaccurate. When this type of comment is
made, the best approach is to say something at that time.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean that you need to engage in an embattled
tirade. Rather, the kinds of comments that you made in your letter
will suffice. You can say something like, ``That's a surprise. I
always report on time.'' Then be quiet and listen to what the
supervisor has to say. His or her response will tell you if there
is confusion over your record, over the policy or if the supervisor
is just plain confused.
</P>
<P>
   At present, you may want to mention to your boss that you were
surprised by the other supervisor's comments. And, if there are
concerns about your hours, this discussion can be a good
opportunity to clear the air. Since it sounds like there is no real
problem here, you should ask your boss if there is anything that
you should do to help clarify the matter with the other supervisor.
More than likely, your boss will indicate that he or she will talk
to the supervisor on this timely matter. &QL;

PANEL DECIDES MOST OF REMAINING EVIDENCE WILL NOT BE RELEASED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A rancorous dispute over how much of the
independent counsel's evidence against President Clinton to make
public formally ended last night, with the House Judiciary
Committee withholding more than 80 percent of the material from
public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40,000 pages of documents from Kenneth W. Starr's
investigation of Clinton's affair with Monica S. Lewinsky will
remain under armed guard, off limits even to the 398 House members
who do not serve on the Judiciary Committee but who may help decide
Clinton's fate, according to the panel's staff.
</P>
<P>
   The development unfolded as the Judiciary Committee's chairman,
Representative Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, unexpectedly dropped his
resistance to several requests from the Democratic minority, amid
growing GOP concerns that the committee's credibility could be
undermined by increasing partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   The full House is expected to vote by Oct. 9 on whether to open
a full-scale impeachment inquiry of Clinton, based on evidence
contained in 18 boxes of Starr's investigative material. The boxes
contained an estimated 50,000 pages of documents and other items
when Starr delivered them.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee released Clinton's videotaped grand-jury
testimony and nearly 3,200 pages of material from the boxes last
week. A final batch of documents, estimated at between 3,000 and
5,000 pages, was sent last night to the Government Printing Office
and is scheduled to be made public on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as aides on the Republican-controlled committee defended
withholding an overwhelming portion of Starr's evidence _
describing it as irrelevant, sexually explicit, or related to
national security _ Hyde approved the most pressing request from
Democrats: to permit committee investigators to inspect an
estimated 20 boxes of additional material that Starr never brought
to Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Starr informed the committee he withheld the information from
Congress either to protect ongoing grand-jury investigations or
privacy rights, or because the material was irrelevant. But several
committee Democrats said they want to determine if Starr withheld
evidence that could be favorable to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken Starr's report was not a balanced presentation of the
evidence,'' said Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Massachusetts
Democrat who serves on the committee. ``Given his poor judgment in
assembling the report, I think it is necessary for our counsel to
look through all that he's got.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde generally accepted Starr's word, saying his view was ``why
bother?'' to look at the extra material. ``But the Democrats want
to see what's over there,'' Hyde said in a news conference. ``They
have a lurking suspicion that there may be exculpatory material,
and so we are going to accommodate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde was particularly accommodating Monday, as the committee
approaches a vote early next week on whether to recommend that the
full House approve a formal impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Amid persistent demands by Democrats for the panel to define
what constitutes an impeachable offense before voting on whether to
seek a formal inquiry, Hyde cleared the way for the Judiciary
subcommittee on the Constitution to take up the issue as early as
Thursday or Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's report cites ``substantial and credible'' evidence that
Clinton committed 11 possible impeachable offenses, including
perjury, obstructing justice, witness tampering, and abusing the
power of his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question facing the committee is quite simple,'' Hyde
said. ``Should we inquire further into these allegations or refuse
to take a closer look and just shut down?''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Hyde abandoned plans for the committee's senior
investigators _ David Schippers for the Republicans and Abbe Lowell
for the Democrats _ to brief the 37-member panel behind closed
doors later this week on Starr's evidence before the lawmakers vote
next week. Democrats have harshly criticized the GOP majority for
conducting much of the preliminary inquiry in closed sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Under Hyde's revised plan, the investigators will brief the
committee in open session next Monday before the lawmakers begin
debating whether to seek a formal inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde also eased fears among many Democrats by announcing he will
grant them the power to subpoena witnesses if the full House
approves the formal inquiry, as it is expected to do. Democrats
have said they want to question Starr, Linda R. Tripp, whose secret
tape recordings spawned Starr's inquiry, and possibly Lewinsky,
among others.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the plans, Hyde expressed a desire ``to ensure
that history will judge us as having fulfilled our duty with honor
and distinction.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House welcomed Hyde's moves, with reservations.
``Certainly actions are more important than words,'' said spokesman
Michael McCurry. ``But the reassurances given by the chairman today
were welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Hyde's actions struck Representative Barney
Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat who sits on the committee, ``as a
hasty effort to try to blunt the points we have been making without
really dealing with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank said Democrats on the committee, not just the
investigators, should be permitted to review Starr's additional
material. He criticized the proposed subcommittee hearing later
this week as ill-planned. And he chastised Hyde for making the
decisions without consulting committee Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Jordan, a spokesman for the committee Democrats, attributed
Hyde's concessions to GOP concerns about a possible backlash.
``Committee Republicans appear to be in full-scale, tactical
retreat on a number of fronts,'' Jordan said. ``These guys can read
polls, and the public clearly and correctly perceives these
proceedings as highly partisan and unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said he was guided by a determination to be ``as fair as
humanly possible'' rather than polls.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hyde continued to rankle Democrats by leaving open the
possibility he will widen the inquiry's scope to Whitewater-related
matters or campaign fund-raising abuses in the 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   As for the vast amount of documents that were withheld,
committee aides said Starr collected three-quarters of the material
in wide-ranging document subpoenas at the White House, Defense
Department, the Secret Service and other agencies. They said the
material included reams of phone logs, visitor logs, and a box
filled with Secret Service videotapes with no relevance to the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The transcripts of only two witnesses _ Clinton and Lewinsky _
have been released to date. Notable among the individuals whose
edited transcripts are expected to be made public Thursday are
Tripp and Kathleen Willey, who was questioned about whether Clinton
made unwanted sexual advances toward her.
</P>
<P>
   Also, edited transcripts of Tripp's audiotaped conversations
with Lewinsky are due to be released, with edited versions of the
tapes to be made available a week or so later.

ECONOMIC TURMOIL PROMPTS GILLETTE CUTBACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The world financial crisis dealt perhaps its hardest
blow yet to Massachusetts Monday when razor-maker Gillette Co. said
it would lay off 11 percent of its worldwide work force by cutting
4,700 jobs as it closes 26 factories and warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-based Gillette, one of the country's most successful
companies, suggested that the reorganization moves were prompted by
economic turmoil in places such as Asia, Russia, and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette also cited one-time startup costs associated with the
recent launch of its Mach3 triple-bladed razor as a reason why its
third-quarter profits could drop 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other local industries have been hurt by the fallout of the
overseas financial crisis, including financial services and
high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette's announcement Monday was additional evidence that the
effects of problems overseas have spread to consumer-products
giants such as Coca-Cola Co. and Procter &AMP; Gamble Co.
</P>
<P>
   When asked during a teleconference call how layoffs would affect
Massachusetts, where Gillette employs about 6,000 workers, chairman
and chief executive officer Alfred M. Zeien declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't disclose specifics until the people involved are
informed,'' said Zeien, who indicated that layoffs and plant
closings would be phased in over the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gillette recently invested about $400 million to
upgrade its South Boston factory to make Mach3 razors.
</P>
<P>
   Those improvements suggest that cuts would fall heaviest at the
company's most obsolete and underutilized facilities.
</P>
<P>
   For eight years, Gillette has churned out double-digit profit
gains quarter after quarter, but even with strong early sales from
the Mach3 triple-bladed razor, the company is likely to see a
surprise 20 percent drop in profits for its latest quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette is hardly alone in being hurt by recessions in Asia and
slowing economies in Latin America, but few US companies have been
as hard hit as Gillette, which has seen the value of its stock
decline by about a third since July.
</P>
<P>
   The overall stock market, as measured by the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500, has seen a decline of about 11 percent since the market
reached its peak a little over two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   With its Sensor and Mach3 razors, Duracell batteries, Oral-B
toothbrushes, and Right Guard deodorant, Gillette is a household
name in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But more than 60 percent of the company's 1997 sales of $10.06
billion came from overseas, and between 15 and 20 percent of sales
came from sales in emerging markets, according to Edward Jones
analyst Tony Vento.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, about $3.4 billion of Gillette's 1997 sales came from
outside the United States, Western Europe, and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   This overseas exposure leaves Gillette especially vulnerable to
upheavals in foreign economies.
</P>
<P>
   Zeien expressed the hope that Gillette's rare disappointing
quarter was a ``hiccup'' and that the company would quickly
rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mach3 is going gangbusters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our underlying business fundamentals remain very strong,''
Zeien said. ``We will re-emerge from the current global
difficulties in great shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was impressed by Zeien's optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to him to prove it,'' said PaineWebber analyst Andrew
Shore. ``This company has had two years of lackluster results.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Zeien conceded that this year's third quarter is ``one we'd
like to forget.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gillette's fourth quarter is likely to be ``OK,'' said
Zeien, who added that he expects fourth-quarter earnings to rise in
the ``low double-digits.''
</P>
<P>
   After taking an after-tax charge of about $350 million for its
restructuring, Gillette said it expects to break even for its third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   By the year 2001, the restructuring changes announced Monday
should lead to annual savings of about $200 million, Gillette said.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Gillette saw profits dip was in 1990 when it
introduced its Sensor, its previous generation of top-of-the line
razors.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette has said its Mach3 razor represents an investment of
more than $1 billion when plant upgrades, employee training, and
marketing and advertising costs are added up.
</P>
<P>
   A big chunk of those costs had always been expected to affect
Gillette in the third quarter of 1998. As long as two years ago,
the quarter had been identified as a potentially challenging time
for the company, Zeien said.
</P>
<P>
   What the company hadn't counted on were recessions and slowing
economies overseas.
</P>
<P>
   And how soon Gillette rebounds to its old winning ways may now
depend on economies in places such as Russia and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Under the reorganization of its global business, four executives
will have new roles, Gillette said.
</P>
<P>
   Edward F. DeGraan, executive vice president of the Duracell
North Atlantic Group, will lead Gillette's business units for
blades and razors, toiletries, and batteries, Gillette said.
</P>
<P>
   Archibald Livis, former chairman of Braun AG, will lead the
company's Braun, Oral-B, and stationery products units.
</P>
<P>
   Executive vice president Robert G. King, who is responsible for
Gillette's grooming products in North America and Western Europe,
will head commercial operations in North America and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Jorgen Wedel, an international Gillette executive, will head
commercial operations in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette made its announcements after the US stock markets
closed. On the New York Stock Exchange, Gillette shares finished
the day at 40, up 1 11/16.

 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joe Torre intends to stand in the middle of the
Yankees' clubhouse at the Stadium Tuesday and remind his players to
continue playing as they have all year. Concentrate, play hard.
Keep everything the same, ignore the changing circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who won 114 of 162 regular-season games and
established their dominance over six months, begin the playoffs
Tuesday tonight in the three-of-five-game division series against
the American League West winner, Texas. The Yankees' David Wells
will pitch against the Rangers' Todd Stottlemyre; the game is
scheduled to begin at 8:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russian roulette,'' Torre called the five-game format. Two
quick losses and suddenly the team with the the most victories in
the annals of the American League could be on the brink of
elimination _ and the Yankees, who have played down the
significance of their success during the summer, want to follow up
their regular-season achievements with a championship and protect
their place in history. ``If we don't get to the World Series and
finish it off,'' said David Cone, ``some of the luster will be
taken off our record-breaking season. We want to finish it off, and
we're in a very good position to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells, who has developed a knowledge of Yankee history, feels
that if this team can beat the Rangers, win the AL championship
series and then the World Series, the 1998 Yankees can be ranked as
``probably the best'' team in club history. ``Everybody has
contributed, and if that should happen'' _ winning the World Series
_ ``that's what would make this team unbelievable, beyond great.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Texas Manager Johnny Oates: ``There's a certain amount of
pressure of playing 162 games and winning 114 of them, and you
realize it can all go down the drain in a matter of three days. But
Joe Torre and Don Zimmer and the rest of the staff and the players,
in particular, are capable of handling that. They know they're good
and they play with a great deal of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre decided Monday that Chad Curtis would start in left field
in Game 1, rather than the hot-hitting Shane Spencer or the
veterans Tim Raines or Darryl Strawberry. Spencer hit seven home
runs in his last 27 at-bats, becoming an instant celebrity with
Yankees fans. But Torre decided to go with Curtis, by far the best
defensive outfielder of the four, to better support the pitching of
Wells, who has a tendency to generate an unusual number of fly
balls.
</P>
<P>
   For all of his unusual attributes _ the tattoos, the occasional
petulance, the emotionalism _ Wells has established himself as a
first-rate big-game pitcher, someone who embraces pressure. He is
3-0 with a 2.48 earned run average during his career in division
series play and 1-0 with a 2.93 ERA in championship series, and has
allowed one hit and no runs in four and one-third innings in the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Wells seemed to be plummeting into his big-game trance Monday
afternoon, offering one-word greetings to teammates, his goofiness
hidden. Speaking with reporters, he was calm and direct, the same
approach he will want to take to the mound Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wells must navigate his way through a Texas lineup that averaged
nearly six runs a game this year and, incredibly, batted .315
against left-handed pitchers. The Rangers socked Wells for seven
runs in two and two-thirds innings in the Texas heat on May 6. But
on Aug. 21, Wells pitched a complete-game shutout at the Ballpark
in Arlington. The left-hander's fastball is usually reliable, but
when he is at his best _ as on May 17, when he pitched his perfect
game _ Wells' curveball is breaking sharply, with the
12-o'clock-to-6-o'clock trajectory.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees reviewed scouting reports Monday and were no doubt
informed that Mark McLemore, the Texas leadoff hitter, has been in
a prolonged slump, and that Will Clark, the Rangers' first baseman,
who bats behind Juan Gonzalez, has a fractured toe that limits his
mobility. The hitters surrounding Gonzalez could struggle; logic
suggests that Wells and the Yankees will make a habit of pitching
around the powerful right fielder in this series, or at least force
him to chase pitches out of the strike zone. Said Wells, ``You
can't make any mistakes with these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   This is particularly true with Stottlemyre throwing for the
Rangers. Stottlemyre struggled at first, after St. Louis traded him
to Texas; he seemed to be pressing, overthrowing his fastball and
breaking ball, and he was hit hard.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, who can become a free agent after this season,
realized he was uncomfortable with the idea of being a so-called
hired gun. He was acquired to play a major role for a finite time,
carrying the burden of great expectations from new teammates.
During the Yankees' games in Texas in August, Stottlemyre
approached Cone _ who had been a hired gun for Toronto in 1993 _
and asked for advice.
</P>
<P>
   Cone suggested some things to think about, suggested that
Stottlemyre relax, and Stottlemyre found his stuff, his sharp
curveball. He won his last two starts, allowing only one run in 15
innings. ``He was very nice in his last three outings,'' said
Oates, ``and dominant in his last two.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching highlights the night the Rangers clinched the division
title, Cone saw Stottlemyre hugging teammates and happily spraying
Champagne. ``He looked like he fit right in,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   Oates needs Stottlemyre to pitch deep into Tuesday night's game;
in fact, he needs all of his starters to pitch effectively and well
into the seventh or eighth inning. If the Rangers must use their
relievers in the middle innings, Oates said, they will be inviting
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked about trying to get out front and putting a
little more pressure on them,'' Oates said. ``But when you go
through what the Yankees have gone through, for the city they
represent, there's enough pressure that I don't think it's going to
be a big deal with them.''
</P>
<P>
   But the pressure of expectation will hang over them. Keep
everything the same, Torre will tell them. Play hard and
concentrate.

U.S. HEDGE FUND BAILOUT RAISES ASIAN EYEBROWS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In Asia, which has been scolded and sermonized by
the United States over its economic policies, there is a sense of
grim satisfaction at the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital
Management LP, and at its $3.5 billion rescue by a team of banks
and brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders here noted that after prodding Asian
governments from Japan to Indonesia to increase the openness of
their financial institutions, the United States was bushwhacked by
the calamitous losses at one of its own big hedge funds. And after
urging Asia not to bail out its sinking banks, the United States
did something suspiciously close to that with Long-Term Capital.
</P>
<P>
   Although the rescue money was put up by banks rather than
taxpayers, the bailout was engineered by the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It showed us that the Americans could easily ignore their own
principles,'' said Tadashi Nakamae, a prominent economist and
president of Nakamae International Economic Research in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   American policy makers and economists have regularly declared
that Asian countries would rebound more quickly from the economic
crisis if they allowed at least some of their troubled banks to
fail. By pumping money into the financial sector, the American
experts warn, the Asian countries are simply delaying the cleansing
change that their economies must undergo.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Long-Term Capital, American regulators faced the same
question of whether to allow a major financial player go belly up.
Some experts here are unsympathetic to the argument that a bankrupt
Long-Term Capital would have unhinged financial markets around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, if LTCM fails, there would be a lot of negative
chain reactions,'' Nakamae said. ``But to me, that has nothing to
do with systemic risk. It is simply a failure of the speculative
chain.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people likened last week's rescue to a ``convoy'' _ a
pejorative term that describes the Japanese practice of asking
strong banks to bail out weaker ones, with the result that neither
bank ends up healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, few people here are gloating over a high-flying
investment fund that crashed to earth _ even one based in
Greenwich, Conn. It hits too close to home in Asia, which has seen
many of its top investors wiped out in the financial crisis. As it
happens, few Asian banks had invested heavily in Long-Term Capital.
Among those that put up the minimum $10 million to join: Bank of
China.
</P>
<P>
   David Li, chairman of Bank of East Asia in Hong Kong, said
several wealthy individuals in Hong Kong had invested in Long-Term
Capital, and had called him to ask nervously about the prospects of
getting their investment back.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the fund's near-collapse might not have crushed global
markets, people here said it could have unnerved fragile investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this fund were allowed to fail, it would have affected the
confidence of investors,'' said Paul R. Lowndes, secretary of the
Hong Kong Association of Banks. ``If you get something too large,
with too many dependencies, you may need to overcome your tendency
not to intervene.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowndes said the hedge fund's near-death experience would have a
beneficial effect if it woke up American policy makers to the risks
of these largely unregulated investment pools, which typically use
arcane calculations to place huge bets on the movements of interest
rates and foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds have become a obsession in Hong Kong, where the
government has blamed them for manipulating its currency and stock
markets. Last month, the government intervened massively in the
stock market in a campaign to punish what it described as a cabal
of overseas hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Donald Tsang, Hong Kong's financial secretary, has set off
on a three-week tour of Europe and the United States to urge policy
makers to adopt stricter regulations and oversight of hedge funds.
In remarks to reporters over the weekend, Sir Donald said Long-Term
Capital would help his case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sentiment has changed around the world on what we should do
about monitoring the flow of major hedge funds,'' he said. ``One
thing is quite clear: Whether you are a skeptic or a supporter, we
have a common problem and we need resolution because it is going to
affect each one of us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In addition to buying shares, Sir Donald curtailed short-selling
_ or the selling of borrowed shares _ and trading of futures
contracts. He has declined to identify which foreign hedge funds
were active in the Hong Kong market.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia has also cited overseas hedge funds as one of the
reasons it recently imposed sweeping capital controls on its
markets. Government officials said the sudden huge flows of money
into and out of Malaysia were making a mockery of its efforts to
stabilize its currency and revive the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The financial world is dominated by those with big bucks, and
those guys can invest a small sum to make sure we don't succeed,''
said Noordin Sopiee, chairman of the Institute of Strategic and
International Studies, a research group in Kuala Lumpur that
advised the government on its controls.
</P>
<P>
   For all the ill will toward hedge funds, people here acknowledge
that foreign investment funds are not the root cause of their
economic distress. Most agree that Asian countries must overhaul
their ailing commercial banks if they want to restore the
confidence of investors. And few expect Asia's governments to use
the rescue of Long-Term Capital as a justification for further
bailouts.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Monday, Japan's ruling and opposition parties reached an
agreement on banking reform that may set the stage for landmark
legislation. Among the key provisions: The ruling Liberal
Democratic Party will not pour more government money into Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., one of the country's largest and most
troubled banks, to keep it afloat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stemming the problems of one hedge fund is easy to do,'' said
the head of research at a major foreign bank in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Mrs. Watanabe doesn't have her deposits in a hedge fund,''
he said, referring to a name for the ubiquitous Japanese housewife.
``Mrs. Watanabe has her deposits in a bank.''

HURRICANE GEORGES MOVES INLAND, LOSES SOME OF ITS PUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to move 4h and 5th grafs up from bottom)  
 (ATTN: La., Ala., Miss., Fla.)  (lh) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ From the eastern reaches of New Orleans to
Pensacola, Fla., Hurricane Georges pounded the Gulf Coast on Monday
with destructive winds and even more destructive rains, then slowly
began to loose some of its punch as its drifted inland.
</P>
<P>
   Battering the beaches, towns and cities of Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle with winds up to 100
miles an hour and more than a foot of rain, it left trees uprooted,
power lines down, roads washed out and hundreds of homes and
businesses badly knocked about or flooded.
</P>
<P>
   It spawned tornadoes, most of them harmless, though the winds of
one were clocked at 174 miles an hour as it spun past an airport.
The hurricane pounded a crippled ship and the tug that was towing
it so hard that Coast Guard officials worried both might founder.
And it was blamed for two deaths in New Orleans, one occurring when
an elderly woman suffered a heart attack while being evacuated from
her flooded home and the other occurring when a man set his
darkened house afire while trying to light it with a candle.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters, along with public safety officials, warned that
because the storm was so saturated with rain after a slow meander
across the tropical waters of the Gulf, and because it was moving
inland so slowly, the Gulf Coast and the rest of the Deep South
should be on the lookout for heavy flooding over the next several
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not quite out of the water yet,'' Police Chief Ben
Morris told the residents of Slidell, La., on the Mississippi
border, as they began to emerge from shelters and boarded up homes
to take up the task of cleaning up behind Georges.
</P>
<P>
   But despite all the misery and grief caused when Georges roared
ashore out of the Gulf before daybreak Monday morning, its eye
centered on Biloxi, Miss., the storm was not its old killer self.
</P>
<P>
   It could not sustain its 100-mile-an-hour-plus winds for long
once it began to drag over land, leading weather forecasters to
predict, cautiously, that it would probably blow itself out in the
next few days. Moreover, Gulf Coast residents, given plenty of
warning that Georges earlier had killed 300 people and left 100,000
more homeless down in the Caribbean, largely avoided its worst by
battening down ahead of time and fleeing, when they could, to
higher ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could have been a lot worse,'' Kenny Campo, a marina operator
said, as he surveyed his mostly unscathed place in low-lying St.
Bernard Parish, southeast of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Pensacola was awash in more than 20 inches of rain that fell
there in less than 24 hours. But for all that, flood damage was
relatively minor in most places.
</P>
<P>
   A few streets in downtown Mobile, Ala., were waist-deep in sea
water, and the causeway leading southeast out of town was hit by a
sea surge that swept away some stores and restaurants. Yet most of
the city's businesses and homes escaped.
</P>
<P>
   One Mobile resident, Sandra Pettway, was less traumatized by
Georges than the 8-foot alligator it drove up into the housing
project in which she lives with her three children. ``Some people
were shooting at him,'' she said. ``But I didn't have a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   In Biloxi, there was also flooding. But the town's main
attraction, its casinos, largely escaped serious damage _ though
not a loss of revenue from having to shut down for several days. A
few miles further west, in Gulfport, the wind blew so hard at one
point that it toppled over an 18-wheel tractor-trailer on
Interstate 10.
</P>
<P>
   But most houses and businesses escaped with only a scratch or
two. And in New Orleans, the place where Georges potentially could
have caused a huge catastrophe _ the city has the Gulf Coast's
largest concentration of people and lies 6 feet below sea level
behind its levees _ there was hardly any real damage except along
the shores of Lake Ponchartrain, where storm-driven waves smashed a
line of fishing shacks and cottages.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   By late afternoon, with Georges beginning to slowly drift off
toward the northeast and winds and rains letting up a bit, New
Orleanians, especially those hunkered down in makeshift shelters
like the Superdome, began to chafe for their freedom.
</P>
<P>
   A curfew was still in effect _ ``for your safety until we can
get things straightened out a bit,'' Mayor Marc Morial said _ but
with each passing hour it was ignored by more and more people. Down
in the old French Quarter, Chris LeBoeuf ventured forth and opened
his souvenir shop. And in no time customers were arriving,
especially tourists who had been trapped in their hotels for two
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come in, and they're just glad to have some place to go
for a change,'' LeBoeuf said. The police let it go.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the city's store owners, Frank Ordano, complained
that power company crews had not been fast enough getting power
restored. ''There's no bad weather here,'' he declared. ``Sunday
was a little bit rainy and wind, Monday even less so.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Mobile, by late in the day, the had-enough-of-all-this
story was much the same, though the wind there was still blowing up
to 60 miles an hour, and the rain was still coming down. Debbie
Stephens, hunkered down at home rather than in a shelter, said she
and her family were safe enough but the power was out and ``there's
just nothing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just about to die from boredom,'' she continued. ``There's
no power, no television, no stereo. You can't read. We've played
all the games. And now everybody's eating everything in sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Kirk Fordice of Mississippi said after an early look at the
damage in his state that while Mississippians had been lucky,
foresight also had played a major role in limiting loss. ``The
preparation for this emergency,'' he said, ``is much better than in
years past.''
</P>
<P>
   Weather forecasters predicted that because Georges began to lose
some of its punch as soon as it came ashore early Monday morning,
it probably would lose still more power overnight as it inched
further inland _ barring an unexpected resurgence of energy. By
Tuesday, they said, its maximum sustained winds should be well
below 75 miles an hour, the hurricane force threshold.

TEXAS EDUCATION BOARD SOLD DISNEY STOCK AT OPPORTUNE TIME 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When the Republican-controlled State Board of
Education voted in July to dump all the Walt Disney Co. stock held
by the Permanent School Fund, critics said it was a bad financial
decision and one based on misplaced moral outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was business acumen, luck or a combination, the board
sold when the stock was trading at a near high, and the fund earned
more than $20.2 million on the sale, according to figures from the
Texas Education Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Disney stock dropped by 34 percent between July 14, when the
fund began selling shares, and the close of trading Monday _ more
than three times the 11 percent decline in the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 during that same period. The S&AMP;P 500 is a widely used index of
the stock-picking performance by professional money managers.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts, though, say there are too many factors other than
sale price to be considered, such as what investments replaced the
Disney holdings, before they could stipulate that the decision to
sell was prudent.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that since the day we sold (Disney), every stock
in the portfolio went down,'' said board member Will Davis,
D-Austin, who voted against the divestiture.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the value of the Permanent School Fund, the public
school trust fund, dropped from $18 billion to $16 billion in the
past two months, said TEA spokeswoman Debbie Graves Ratcliffe. She
added that it is impossible to determine what investments were made
with the proceeds from the sale of Disney stock, given the volume
of trading by fund managers.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who chairs the board committee that oversees the
Permanent School Fund, had tried to block the board vote on selling
Disney stock. He said Friday he still would vote to retain the
Disney investments, although he acknowledges that if the board
still held Disney stock it would be valued less today than it was
in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coincidentally, it turned out the sale resulted in a profit, a
cash profit which might not be there if we owned the stock today,''
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Bannister, an analyst with Edward Jones in St. Louis, said
the decision was wise in the short term, but, ``You have to keep in
mind that the broad market has fallen as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, in hindsight, they sold and locked in a profit. It
was better to sell then than now, but I still think the fund is
sound. ... We still think the long-term prospects are solid.''
</P>
<P>
   Bannister added that she is advising investors that now is a
good time to move in and buy Disney stock, with the intent of
holding it for 12 to 18 months, but it will take some time for
earnings to grow.
</P>
<P>
   The board voted 8-4 along party lines in July to sell all 1.2
million shares of Disney stock, citing displeasure with the violent
and sexually explicit movies and records made by Disney
subsidiaries. It was the first time the board had ever directed its
financial investment managers to make a specific sale or purchase.
</P>
<P>
   But the American Family Association, a national conservative
group, had been pressuring the board to divest itself of Disney
stock for more than a year, in part because of the company's
decision to extend benefits to same-sex partners of its employees.
</P>
<P>
   Board Chairman Jack Christie, R-Houston, said the decision
turned out to be wise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an excellent time to sell,'' Christie said. ``We sold
high, and we reaped the profits, and if it happened to send a
message at the same time, fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Christie said the decision was part luck and part sound business
practice.
</P>
<P>
   From a business standpoint, Christie said, it was wise to sell
when the price per share was high, and some advisers were warning
board members that Disney ``had some aspects that are not real
mainstream America'' and that the company could fall into disfavor,
just as tobacco stocks have over the years with some investors.
</P>
<P>
   Christie said his concerns about Disney center on its music and
filmmaking subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Board member David Bradley, R-Beaumont and one of the social
conservatives who pushed for the Disney divestiture, said he thinks
the profit reflects business acumen and not luck.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from major brokerage houses on expected earnings, plus a
boycott of Disney led by such groups as the Southern Baptist
Convention and the American Family Association, all had pointed to
a downturn in Disney's earnings, Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   TEA's internal investment managers as well as external
investment companies that manage a portion of the Permanent School
Fund began selling off the Disney stock on &UR;  &LR; July 14, when 208,900
shares were sold at $39.86 and $39.89. By the time the last 56,000
shares were traded on July 28, the price per share had dropped to
$36.17, according to information released by TEA.
</P>
<P>
   Disney stock has continued to drop in value since then, and it
closed Monday  &UR;  &LR; at 26 1/4, up 5/8. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Disney shares have fallen almost 40 percent since early May,
when it reached a 52-week high of 42 3/4, &UR;  &LR; and almost a third in
value since the school fund divested. The company warned earlier
this month that fiscal fourth-quarter profits would fall because of
weakness in Asian markets and in Disney's film business. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Ratcliffe of TEA said internal investment managers realized a
profit of $19.9 million on an investment of $21.3 million. Private
investment companies realized a profit of $303,592 on an investment
of $5.8 million, she added.
</P>
<P>
   The stock sale was criticized at the time by some lawmakers who
said if the board were truly concerned about investments in
companies whose products are harmful to schoolchildren, then it
would also have to divest itself of stock the school fund holds in
casino and brewing companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney stock sale represents the first time the board has
ever ordered managers of the public school trust fund to buy or
sell a specific stock.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, however, the Permanent School Fund has taken its
cue from state leaders who encouraged divestiture of other stocks
on moral grounds. For example, an investment manager in 1998 sold
$3.5 million in Seagram stock after Republican state Sen. Bill
Ratliff, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, protested
``filthy'' lyrics on Seagram's MCA record albums.
</P>
<P>
   The school fund also sold off all tobacco stock in 1996 after
Attorney General Dan Morales and Christie urged them to do so
because of the state's lawsuit against tobacco companies.

EASTMAN KODAK AND INTEL INTRODUCE COMPACT DISC FOR PICTURES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first tangible result of a marketing partnership they
announced in April, the Eastman Kodak Co. and the Intel Corp. on
Monday introduced a compact disk for pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The Picture CD combines digital versions of the prints
photographers receive when they submit film for processing with
software to enhance, crop and e-mail those photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The new disk, which will cost consumers $8.95 to $10.95 on top
of regular processing costs, duplicates abilities that have been
available through commercial software packages or through kiosks at
retail stores. And, Kodak has an arrangement that enables
subscribers to America Online to receive digital photographs via
e-mail. But the Picture CD is the first product to include the
software along with the photographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're eliminating all obstacles to taking pictures further,''
said George M.C. Fisher, Kodak's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   For Kodak, that could mean selling more film and more
photographic paper. And, since the CD's have room for more than the
photographs and software, Kodak could also juice up revenues by
selling advertising space. Kodak might even sell ``product
placements'' _ say, charge a shoe company for a feature that lets a
user superimpose her face on that of an athlete wearing that brand
of running shoe.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's payback is more indirect. The ability to manipulate and
transmit images could give consumers another reason to buy powerful
computers, hopefully incorporating Intel processors. ``We want to
promote visually connected P.C.'s,'' said Craig Barrett, Intel's
president.
</P>
<P>
   For the longer term, Kodak and Intel will try to jointly develop
a digital camera. ``The Picture CD is a bridge to the totally
digital future,'' Barrett said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither company would discuss plans for sharing revenues or
profits. But each has anted up $75 million to market the Picture
CD, and they are sharing the $50 million cost of upgrading Kodak's
Qualex processing labs to handle the disk.

YANKEES IN DO OR DIE SITUATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What does 114 wins get you? How about pressure added
onto pressure, with George Steinbrenner's finger on the button?
</P>
<P>
   That's the unfortunate but reality-driven situation here as the
Yankees start what has to be a run to their 24th world championship
Tuesday night. Or else. Every team still alive yearns for the
title. A couple, Atlanta and Cleveland, perhaps feel that they are
owed one.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the Yanks. Nothing less than another flag will
do, and no one knows that more than they. Their wondrous season is
just that and always will be. But they will be regarded as an
abject failure unless they win it all.
</P>
<P>
   It's pressure that comes with wearing the pinstripes, with
over-achieving, with expectations that seem superhuman yet
attainable. The Yankees are 11 wins away from what they feel is
rightfully theirs, unless the unimaginable occurs. They'll take the
first step Tuesday night against Texas in the best-of-five,
anything-goes division series.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Yankees manager Joe Torre was asked how he might even
recognize an air of overconfidence. His team, after all, clinched a
playoff berth in August and a division title early in September. It
has been playing against history since May.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have to sense it, I guess,'' Torre said. ``If we weren't
overconfident with a 20-game lead and nothing at stake, I don't
think we will be now. I don't think (114 wins) buys us a ticket to
anything other than a five-game series.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Monday, the questions were as much about the frosting on
the cake as about how to contain the dangerous Texas hitters.
Tuesday night's starter, David Wells, actually said, ``To win the
World Series would be the most unbelievablest (sic) thing for
everyone involved with 1998 Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   New York enters the playoffs having won seven straight and 9 of
11. The Yanks took 8 of 11 from the Rangers this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a special year,'' Torre said. ``But anytime you
get to the postseason, you want to get to the World Series and win
it. But we always have high goals. Winning 114, all that does is
hopefully give us some more confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things can happen,'' offered manager Johnny Oates.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas offense is right up there with the 1998 edition of
Murderers Row. Juan Gonzalez (.318, 45 HRs, 157 RBIs, 50 doubles)
can take over a short series, as he almost did two years ago,
hitting five homers in 16 at-bats. Pudge Rod-riguez is among the
game's best catchers. Texas can score runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also got a big lift from midseason acquisitions Todd
Stottlemyre, Royce Clayton, and Todd Zeile. Stottlemyre, who came
over from St. Louis, will be up against his father, Mel, the
pitching coach for the Yankees. You can imagine the New York
strategy sessions the past 36 hours.
</P>
<P>
   These two teams met in 1996 in the first round. Texas won the
opener, then the Yanks took the next three en route to the Series.
</P>
<P>
   Texas didn't qualify for the postseason this time around until
the final days of the season, and its 88 wins are the fewest of any
postseason team.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, if the Rangers get any kind of pitching, they
could make things interesting. Stottlemyre had two strong
late-season outings against the Angels, both big wins.
</P>
<P>
   Oates isn't conceding a thing, other than the underdog's best
chance is in a series such as this.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more games you play,'' Oates said, ``the more valid the
record will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Todd Stottlemyre, ``we came to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas has a big hole in middle relief and no decent lefty to
thwart the big lefthanded hitters that punctuate Torre's roster.
The Yankees are loaded at all positions. They have the batting
champ in Bernie Williams and eight players with 15 or more homers.
They will open with Wells, who was a legit Cy Young candidate until
blown away (along with everyone else) by Roger Clemens. They had
more home wins than Florida had wins, period.

   The Yankees are not unlike the Chicago Bulls of recent years,
except that they have no Michael Jordan, just a lot of Scottie
Pippens. That would be enough in the NBA and it was enough this
season to record the second-highest win total of all time. None of
that matters, however, without 11 more. That's the burden of being
good, very good, and being a Yankee.

GOLDMAN PLAN TO SELL STOCK IS CANCELED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)   (af)  
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Blue-chip clients around the world pay Goldman, Sachs
&AMP; Co. to divine the most auspicious time to raise money on stock
markets, so many will surely heed its latest insight: not now.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's top partners announced Monday that the firm would
withdraw its registration to go public, bowing to a sudden and
seemingly cruel twist of financial fortunes since the 130-year-old
partnership elected in June to issue shares.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, as if by curse, Goldman's own surge of quarterly
profit gains has reversed, the sky-high stock prices of its leading
rivals have tumbled, and stock and bond markets have tanked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine that we would advise a client that with the
volatility we have, the falling valuations and uncertainty of
earnings going forward that this is a good time to go public'' for
a financial service company, said Henry M. Paulson Jr., Goldman's
co-chairman and chief executive. ``You have to understand that
these are difficult times.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision does not mean that Goldman will abandon plans to
issue shares, Paulson and Jon S. Corzine, his fellow chairman and
chief executive, said in an interview Monday. They said the firm's
189 general partners had reached a firm consensus in the summer to
become a public company. But they also made it clear that the
offering was unlikely to be revived immediately, given the market's
current turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that the market is in a pretty tender state,''
Corzine said. ``There's no reason to think that it will
self-correct tomorrow or next week.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to postpone the offering indefinitely was conveyed
to Goldman's partners at a general meeting Monday afternoon, and
will be announced to the entire staff Tuesday morning. Corzine and
Paulson told partners that they would revive the firm's traditional
process of grooming and selecting new partners, with a new crop to
be named this autumn.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's decision was not unexpected, given the recent sharp
fall in share prices of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Merrill
Lynch &AMP; Co., its two main peers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the formal decision to postpone the offering is one of
the clearest signs to date that Wall Street does not see a robust
recovery for the markets anytime soon. Goldman executives had
insisted until early September, even after August's sharp stock
market drop, that the public offering was on track.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of initial public offerings have been delayed or canceled
since Russia defaulted on its domestic debt and devalued its
currency in August, and Goldman's decision will send a clear
message to companies that conditions are not likely to improve
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably a big disappointment to a lot of issuers and
brokers and investors,'' John Keefe, an independent analyst, said.
``It's a comment on how fast the market changes _ and how fluffy it
was until now.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's decision became almost inevitable when the firm posted
its third-quarter results _ down a sharp 25 percent from the second
quarter and below last year's third-quarter performance as well.
Goldman executives say privately that the fourth quarter looks even
worse unless markets stage an unexpectedly rapid recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, moreover, is an important player in the $3.65 billion
rescue of Long-Term Capital Management, the speculative hedge fund
tottering on the brink of collapse, threatening the health of those
financial markets in which it has made enormous leveraged bets.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman has committed nearly 5 percent of its partners' $6.6
billion in capital to that effort, a concentrated dose of risk for
the firm at an awkward time.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the changing fortunes, Standard &AMP; Poor's, the ratings
agency, changed Goldman's credit rating to negative from stable on
Friday, citing slow trading volume, slackening underwriting
business and volatile markets abroad. It also downgraded the
ratings of several other Wall Street firms.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's decision to withdraw the offering _ a registration
with the Securities and Exchange Commission was filed in late
August _ will almost certainly damage morale at the firm,
especially because Corzine and Paulson had indicated that they
would share as much as $6 billion of the new putative market value
with employees below the level of partner.
</P>
<P>
   The postponement will also mean that controlling partners, the
youngest of whom might have expected to see their net worths rise
by about $50 million each, will now have to delay that
gratification.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this was some big shock,'' Corzine said. ``We
work in an industry where people are accustomed to these kinds of
adjustments to what the market offers.''
</P>
<P>
   Paulson added that he did not expect that Goldman would have to
endure again the lengthy and often contentious internal debate
leading up to June's decision to go public, an option that had been
considered and rejected half a dozen times in the two decades prior
to this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The positive thing that has taken place over the last year
here is that we have developed a strong organizational consensus to
match our structure to our mission,'' Paulson said. ''We are
committed to it emotionally and intellectually _ when the time is
right.''

<P>
   Scolding America's companies and their accountants for using
``accounting hocus-pocus,'' Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, said Monday that his staff
would crack down on businesses that used certain controversial
accounting methods to manipulate the numbers reported to
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt's surprisingly harsh criticism and his far-reaching plan
to stop the accounting abuses came after a string of companies have
announced that the profits they previously reported were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies where such announcements have led to large
declines in stock prices are Cendant, Sunbeam, Livent and Oxford
Health Plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see greater evidence of these illusions or tricks,'' Levitt
said at a news conference at New York University. ``We intend to
step in now and turn around some of these practices.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he did not name any corporations, Levitt said his staff
would immediately increase its scrutiny of companies that used
certain aggressive accounting techniques to inflate their quarterly
earnings and would soon issue new accounting rules and guidelines
intended to halt the abuses.
</P>
<P>
   He also called for a review of how the nation's public
accounting firms audit financial statements, saying he feared that
auditors might not be doing enough to find their clients'
accounting shenanigans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rely on auditors to put something like the Good
Housekeeping Seal of Approval on the information investors
receive,'' Levitt said in a speech prepared to be delivered later
at the university's new Center for Law and Business. ``As I look at
some of the failures today, I can't help but wonder if the staff in
the trenches of the profession have the training and supervision
they need to insure that audits are being done right.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and
several large accounting firms praised Levitt's plan, saying they
shared his concerns and were eager to work with the commission on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt said that the commission's enforcement division would
focus on companies that use certain accounting methods that allow
them to ``manage earnings'' so that profits can be increased or
decreased at will in such a way that the bottom line does not
reflect actual operations.
</P>
<P>
   He specifically said that the commission was frustrated with
companies that used a factory closing or a work force reduction as
an opportunity to take millions of dollars of one-time charges for
``restructuring.''
</P>
<P>
   By inflating those write-offs, companies get the bad news out of
the way at once and can clear their balance sheets of expensive
assets that would otherwise reduce the bottom line for years to
come. For example, Motorola announced recently that it would cut
15,000 jobs and take a restructuring charge of $1.95 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has also been critical of companies that acquire
other companies and then write off much of the purchase price by
calling it ``research and development.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, the commission had blocked America Online, the
biggest Internet company, from reporting its fiscal fourth-quarter
earnings for nearly two months because of disagreements over how
much the company should write off in its acquisitions of Mirabilis
and Net Channel. America Online finally reached an agreement with
the commission and published its results Monday, greatly scaling
back the size of the research write-off.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt said that other companies were trying to bolster their
earnings by manipulating revenue numbers. For instance, many of the
companies forced to restate their financial statements this year
had reported revenues that later turned out to be fictional or
included sales transactions that were not yet completed.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, executives had inflated earnings by manipulating
the amounts set aside for future costs like loan losses, sales
returns or warranty costs.
</P>
<P>
   To stop the accounting abuses, Levitt said that the commission
would write new accounting guidelines on the ``dos and don'ts of
revenue recognition.'' The commission will also begin requiring
detailed disclosures about how management estimates the value of
various write-offs or reserves and the other assumptions made in
preparing financial statements.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt called on the Financial Accounting Standards Board to
pass new accounting rules quickly, including one that would clarify
when a company can record a liability. The commission has already
pressed the accounting board to change the rule that allows
companies to write off large amounts of an acquisition as research
and development.
</P>
<P>
   And, he asked both the AICPA and the Public Oversight Board to
review whether auditors should change the procedures they use in
performing an annual audit.
</P>
<P>
   A blue-ribbon panel _ led by John C. Whitehead, a former deputy
secretary of State and a retired senior partner at Goldman, Sachs &AMP;
Co., and Ira M. Millstein, a corporate governance expert at the law
firm of Weil, Gotshal &AMP; Manges _ will also develop recommendations
for audit committees to follow so that investors are better
protected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The motivation to meet Wall Street earnings expectations may
be overriding common sense business practices,'' Levitt said. ``Too
many corporate managers, auditors and analysts are participants in
a game of nods and winks.'' &QL;

   &UR; Warnings to Passengers After Bahamas Murders &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the past several weeks cruise lines have been advising
passengers to stay in the main tourist areas in ports of call. The
warning follows three recent murders in Nassau, The Bahamas _ those
of two tourists on a secluded beach, and the shooting death of a
Carnival crew member in downtown Nassau. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Disney Magic crew members informally warn passengers about the
crimes, said Amy Foley, a Disney Cruise Line spokeswoman, and tell
them to be cautious in Nassau. Disney has posted a sign at the
gangway in Nassau warning passengers not to travel alone. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carnival is less specific in its warnings. A spokeswoman,
Jennifer de la Cruz, says that before arriving at any port, its
cruise directors stress the need to exercise common sense and
caution. The same is true on Royal Caribbean and Celebrity,
according to Richard Steck, ``but we emphasize those cautions more
than once on our visits to Nassau.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of the two women were discovered on Aug. 22, in
bushes off a path between Cabbage Beach and the Paradise Island
Golf Course. One victim, a 32-year-old elementary school teacher
from Richmond, had been missing since late July; her body was found
in a shallow grave. The other, a 24-year-old British schoolteacher
from Banbury, Oxfordshire, had disappeared Aug. 21 while sunbathing
on a secluded beach. After she was raped, strangled and robbed, her
body was dumped in bushes.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 2, the crew member from the Carnival Ecstasy was
walking with other crew members along Bay Street at about 1 a.m.
when he was shot. The killer is still at large. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 10 the Bahamas Christian Council called on the
government to take ``draconian and strong measures'' to combat
violent crime. Eight days later, an 18-year-old unemployed
landscaper _ who had been arrested on suspicion of murdering the
British woman but later released _ was re-arrested and charged with
both murders. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Names of Next of Kin Requested for Flights &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Passengers boarding flights to foreign countries or returning to
the United States on nonstop flights from foreign countries will
now be asked for a name and telephone number for next of kin. The
new rule, which was created by a 1990 law but opposed by the Air
Transport Association as too expensive to carry out, finally went
into effect Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The law grew out of the 1988 sabotage of Pan Am Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland. The Trans World Airlines crash in 1996 and the
Swissair crash on Sept. 2 made the need more apparent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some airlines will ask for the information at the gate, others
will do it at check-in, still others will have travel agents do the
work. Steven Okun, special counsel to the Department of
Transportation, said no fines were envisioned; the department
simply wants compliance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One loophole: passengers can refuse to provide the information. &QL;

   &UR; Autumn Leaves, Seen From a Train &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the countryside wearing its fall colors, Amtrak offers
several scenic train trips in the Eastern United States. Here are a
few examples. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the Northeast, the Adirondack journeys up the Hudson River
every day on its trip from New York to Albany, and then travels
through the Adirondacks on the way to Montreal. The fare for the
complete trip from New York to Montreal, which takes nine and a
half hours, starts at $49 each way. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Southeastern trains include the Piedmont in North Carolina,
which travels daily between Charlotte and Raleigh. The only
full-length glass-dome car in regular passenger service has been
added to the train on weekends this month. Seating in the Mount
Mitchell dome, which is named for North Carolina's highest
mountain, is limited to 50 passengers and requires a surcharge of
$8. The complete four-hour trip between Raleigh and Charlotte on
weekends starts at $19 each way. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; Frequent-Flier Miles &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Three car rental companies and a hotel chain have formed
frequent flier partnerships. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Members of Continental Airlines' One Pass program can now earn
500 miles when they stay at any Hyatt hotel or resort. No flight is
required for the bonus mileage. Reservations: (800) 233-1234. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thrifty Car Rental, (800) 367-2277, joined Alaska Airlines'
Mileage Plan this month. Mileage Plan members earn 500 miles for
car rentals in conjunction with an Alaskan Airlines or Horizon
Airlines flight. Cars rented at corporate or government rates earn
250 miles. A rental without a flight earns 250 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest Airlines has added Budget, (800) 527-0700, and Dollar,
(800) 421-6868, to its World Perks frequent flier program, joining
Alamo and National as car rental partners. One-day rentals through
Budget earn 250 miles; any longer rental earns 500 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Rentals through Alamo, Dollar and National earn 500 miles; cars
rented at corporate and government rates earn 250 miles. Alamo,
Budget and National require a flight on Northwest or one of its
partner airlines within 24 hours of the rental to earn bonus miles.
A flight is not necessary to earn miles through Dollar.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MARINA PICASSO COLLECTION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ceramics From the Marina Picasso Collection'' will be on view
at the Tacoma Art Museum in Washington through Jan. 10. The 61
pieces on display, originally in Picasso's private collection, now
belong to his granddaughter Marina and were first exhibited in
Spain, by the Fundacion Bancaja in Valencia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only a few have been shown in the United States, and the Tacoma
museum is the only place the collection will be shown outside
Spain. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ceramics were made between 1945 and 1969 in the Provencal
village of Vallauris. In 1946, Picasso rented a house in the
village, which is known for its traditional cookware. His interest
in ceramics began when he visited the workshop of Georges and
Suzanne Ramie and modeled two bulls and the small head of a fawn. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pieces reflect Picasso's favorite themes: the female figure,
the mythical bull, bullfighting and Mediterranean antiquity. The
surface of an everyday item _ a traditional French casserole or a
large oval platter _ often acts as the canvas for a bullring or a
bullfight. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To complement the ceramics, the museum has created a temporary
exhibition, ``Picasso's Studio,'' where more than 50 prints and
drawings will be on display. Five Guernica drawings, on loan from
the Reina Sofia museum in Madrid, will be the highlights. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other items include ``The Blind Minotaur'' and ``Fawn Uncovering
a Woman,'' both from the Vollard Suite of prints published in
1933-34. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The museum, at 12th Street and Pacific Avenue, is open Tuesday
through Sunday; (253) 272-4258. Tickets are $8; ages 6 to 12, $3;
seniors and students, $6; they can also be bought through
Ticketmaster at (253) 627-8497.

 &HT;    Cleveland looks to avenge regular season thrashing by Boston
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The Cleveland Indians begin the American League
Division Series this afternoon in Jacobs Field against the Boston
Red Sox, a team that treated them like the early-season Cleveland
Indians in the movie Major League . . . 20,000 Leagues Under Awful.
</P>
<P>
   Boston won eight of 11 against Cleveland during the regular
season and the assignment is more dubious because the Red Sox are
rolling Pedro Martinez out to the mound. He was 2-0 with a 1.44
earned-run average against the Sons of Geronimo this year.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's answer is to send a manchild out to do a man's job,
but no ordinary manchild. He is 22-year-old Jaret Wright, who was
only 12-10 with a 4.22 earned-run average this season.
</P>
<P>
   But his bloodlines are bright blue. He faced the Red Sox once
this year and beat them, 7-4, holding them to three runs over seven
innings. And as a precocious 21-year-old last season he won three
games in the postseason. He was 4-1 against the New York Yankees
this year _ no other pitcher can make that claim.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Mike Hargrove puts the positive spin on a tough
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jaret has pitched big for us in big games,'' Hargrove said.
``I trust him in big games.''
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 in Cleveland on Wednesday afternoon pits Doc Gooden (0-2,
7.86 against the Red Sox) against knuckleballer Tim Wakefield (2-1,
4.55 against the Indians). The scene shifts to Fenway Park on
Friday and Saturday. It's Charles Nagy (1-0, 2.35 ERA vs. the Red
Sox) against Bret Saberhagen (2-0, 0.75 ERA vs. the Indians) and
Bartolo Colon (0-2, 3.86 ERA vs. the Red Sox) against Pete Schourek
(0-0, 1.80 ERA vs. the Indians).
</P>
<P>
   Game 5, if needed in this best-of-5, will be played in Cleveland
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't there somebody missing from the Cleveland rotation,
somebody who won 15 games? No, Springfield's Dave Burba isn't in
the rotation. He has been placed in the bullpen, but it is no
demotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave has a lot of experience pitching out of the bullpen and
that has as much to do with the decision as anything,'' Hargrove
said. ``We'll use him in long relief, middle relief and set-up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tribe begins the postseason after losing six of its last
seven games and almost lost the home-field advantage last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   All this, though, is familiar territory for Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, they lost four of their last six games and won only
86 games, but they came within two outs of winning the World
Series, finally losing by a run in the 11th inning of Game 7 to the
Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   They won 89 this year, but started fast in the soda cracker thin
American League Central, built a monster lead and coasted home on
rusty runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been a little inconsistent, winning six, losing six, and
I'm not happy about that, rather do without that,'' Hargrove said.
``But we won our division and we have a chance to go to the World
Series again. We also won more games than a year ago and we did it
with some new faces.''
</P>
<P>
   There are injury questions, too.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Jim Thome is back after a long absence, still
searching for that sweet swing he usually displays. But center
fielder Kenny Lofton has an ouchy hamstring, third baseman Travis
Fryman's back has some misaligned vertebrae and closer Mike
Jackson, who gave up one run in 13 postseason innings last year,
has a sore back.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove bravely dismisses Boston's regular-season domination.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens in the regular season doesn't mean anything,'' he
says. ``They still might take us in three straight, but we could
take them in three straight, too. Postseason play is a different
animal.''

 &HT;    Declining rushing game hurting Dallas
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Four weeks into the NFL season, the most
disturbing trend for the Dallas Cowboys has been the steady decline
of their once-overpowering running game.
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure whether the blame belongs to Emmitt Smith, the
offensive line, a combination of both, or none of the above. But no
one can dispute the team's diminishing rushing totals from the
first four games:
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 6, Arizona: 42 carries, 183 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 13, Denver: 30 carries, 169 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 21, New York Giants: 29 carries, 80 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 27, Oakland: 25 carries, 68 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all share in the responsibility of not being able to run
the ball,'' Coach Chan Gailey said Monday, one day after his team
suffered a 13-12 setback to the Raiders at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The decline of the running attack has put extra pressure on
quarterback Jason Garrett, who passed for 222 yards against
Oakland. But two interceptions, including one on the Cowboys' final
possession, robbed them of a chance to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett's inexperience contributed to both of his interceptions,
Gailey said. Both were thrown in the end zone _ directly at the
Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland's first interception was caught by rookie Charles
Woodson. It shocked many at Texas Stadium because the pass,
intended for Michael Irvin, was thrown directly at Woodson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what they were thinking,'' Woodson said. ``He
threw the ball right to me. All I had to do was catch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey blamed himself for the busted play.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday, he said, Garrett had practiced that particular
pass route with Billy Davis and Ernie Mills. The timing was wrong
Sunday because Irvin was not used to that play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my fault for putting (Garrett and Irvin) in that
position,'' Gailey said. ``Ernie and Billy are usually the guys who
run that play.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrett's final interception was even more costly. He had three
options on his final pass of the fourth quarter, and elected to
throw to Davis, who was double-covered by the Raiders near the goal
line. Irvin and Deion Sanders were running short patterns and
appeared open.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland safety Eric Turner easily cradled Garrett's pass,
sealing the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came right to me,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey is concerned that the tough loss might discourage the 2-2
Cowboys, who have an NFC East game at Washington on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't let one loss cost you two,'' Gailey said. ``I told
the team I know it hurts to lose, and it's even harder when you
have opportunities to win. It's frustrating. But we can't let one
loss turn into two. This is a big division game we have to get
ready for.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Troy Aikman hopes to return for the Oct. 11 home
game against Carolina. Gailey said Aikman might be the No. 3
quarterback at Washington, but it's doubtful he'll be used in any
situation.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys reported no major injuries Monday.

 &HT;    DuPont cutting jobs and salaries
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ DuPont Photomasks Inc., a Round Rock-based
supplier of a key semiconductor component, said Monday that it
would cut jobs and salaries because of the global chip slump.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that it would eliminate 40 jobs, 35 in its
Round Rock operations, and cut the salaries of about 15 percent of
its workers starting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the job cuts are in manufacturing, administration and
support in the company's production plant. It will have about 300
workers in Round Rock after the cuts.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont Photomasks makes photomasks, precision plates that
contain the patterns of microelectronic circuits required to
manufacture semiconductor devices.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Austin, Steag Microtech, the U.S. subsidiary of a
German semiconductor equipment maker, laid off 26 of its U.S.
workers, including 12 in Austin, to cut expenses because of the
semiconductor slump. The company employed about 50 workers in
Austin prior to the cutback.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont and Steag are the latest Austin semiconductor-related
companies to make cutbacks because of lower chip sales this year.
</P>
<P>
   At DuPont, the six-month salary cuts will range from 5 percent
to 15 percent and will affect more than 200 managers, executives
and professional workers worldwide. DuPont Photomasks' senior
executives will take the largest salary cuts. Chief executive J.
Michael Hardinger could forgo more than $22,000 in salary over the
next six months.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont Photomasks expects to take a one-time restructuring
charge of about $500,000 to pay for the work force reductions and
other costs. The company wanted to cut costs without cutting deeply
into its work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``While our business has been soft, we need to be prepared for
when the industry comes back,'' said Ken Rygler, executive vice
president for worldwide marketing and strategic planning. Rygler
added that the timing of the industry's rebound remains uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, DuPont Photomasks had postponed construction of a
photomask plant in Gresham, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Some forecasters expect chip industry revenues to fall by 9
percent this year because of soft demand, overcapacity and falling
prices.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont Photomasks' stock closed at $24 a share, down $2 a share,
in Monday Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont Photomasks and rival Photronics Inc., based in Jupiter,
Fla., are the two largest companies in the photomask industry.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont earned $33.5 million on revenue of $271.6 million for the
year ended in June. Photronics, which began production at its Round
Rock plant early this year, reported a profit of $25.6 million on
revenue of $197.5 million for the year ended last October.
</P>
<P>
   The photomask industry could rebound within a few quarters as
chipmakers prepare for production of new products, said analyst
Cody Acree with Southwest Securities in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry has the ability to recover and grow in quick
fashion,'' Acree said.
</P>
<P>
   At Steag, the job cuts came in production and customer support.
The company makes automated equipment to clean semiconductors
during the manufacturing process.
</P>
<P>
   Steag will scale back its equipment production in Austin, but
will maintain sales, support and research and development
operations, said Johannes Brinkmann, president of Steag Microtech.
Some production work is being shifted to the company's larger
factories in Germany.

 &HT;    Buckeyes do nothing but hold top spot
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ It's good work if you can get it; to have the
week off and remain No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask the Ohio State Buckeyes (3-0), who hold onto the top
spot in the college football polls this week despite their
inactivity last Saturday in their only bye of the season. This
Saturday, however, they'll have to work to hang on to No. 1 when
they face No. 7 and undefeated Penn State (3-0) at Ohio Stadium in
both teams' Big Ten opener.
</P>
<P>
   The match up brings back bad memories for OSU, whose defense got
steamrollered by the Nittany Lions running game last season in a
31-27 defeat at State College, Penn. The good news for the
Buckeyes: The PSU player who did the most damage, tailback Curtis
Enis (23 carries, 211 yards, 1 TD) is with the Chicago Bears. The
bad news: Fullback Aaron Harris, who had two touchdowns including
the go-ahead score, is back.
</P>
<P>
   Harris has rushed only three times for 13 yards this season as
he continues to recover from a knee injury. But Harris will be ripe
for action against Ohio State, Buckeye coach John Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether he starts against us, I don't know,'' Cooper said.
``But I think you'll see a lot of him in the game. How effective
he's going to be, I can't answer that.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, OSU let the Nittany Lions rush for 316 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We flat out didn't play,'' senior safety Damon Moore said.
``We didn't tackle worth anything. It kind of seemed like they
intimidated us.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Ahmed Plummer agreed. ``Basically, the defense lost
it for the team,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Promising OSU freshman Jamar Martin will replace reserve
fullback Sean Penny and play behind starter Matt Keller. Penny is
out for the season with a neck iujury. Backup wide receiver Jerry
Redmond also is sidelined (leg fracture) but is expected to return
sometime this season.
</P>
<P>
   Since Penn State joined the Big Ten in 1993, the Buckeyes are
3-2 vs. the Nittany Lions and 2-0 in games played in Columbus. Each
team has been nationally ranked during each of their meetings and
the higher-ranked team always has won. The last time one of the
teams was No. 1 at the time of their meeting (Penn State in '94),
the Nittany Lions won 63-14.
</P>
<P>
   Former local standouts Joe Hartings of St. Henry and Lewe
Sessions of Troy return to their home state Saturday as Nittany
Lions. Cooper said he tried to recruit both.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tough sell to Hartings, a reserve center whose brother,
Jeff, was a two-time All-America guard for PSU.
</P>
<P>
   Sessions, a backup defensive end, was sold on Penn State after
talking with defensive tackle David Fleischhauer, who was being
recruited the same year.

UPON FURTHER REVIEW, METS LOOK TO THE FUTURE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the morning after the biggest collapse in
franchise history, the New York Mets began to look to the future.
They had no other choice.
</P>
<P>
   Because they inexplicably lost their last five games of the
regular season, the Mets did not qualify for the playoffs for the
10th straight season. What was worse, General Manager Steve
Phillips gambled a good portion of his prospects on acquiring Mike
Piazza, Al Leiter and Dennis Cook in an effort to reach the
postseason now.
</P>
<P>
   So now the Mets _ who won the same number of games, 88, as they
had in 1997 without Piazza, Leiter and Cook _ must wait until next
year. Again. And there is no guarantee Piazza will be back, or
Leiter and Cook for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of Mets showed up at Shea Stadium to clean out
their lockers Monday. But shortly after the Mets had been
eliminated from wild-card contention in Atlanta on Sunday afternoon
with a 7-2 loss to the Braves, Phillips said he thought the Mets
had made progress.
</P>
<P>
   He reasoned that the Mets had been in the wild-card hunt until
the final day, whereas a year ago they had been essentially
eliminated with more than a week to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the perception of this organization is better than it
was a year ago,'' Phillips said. ``My sense is that the fans
perceive the organization as being committed to winning. And
willing to invest in winning as well.''
</P>
<P>
   It is up to Phillips to demonstrate this in the off-season, as
the focus shifts to re-signing Piazza, the team's top offensive
player, and Leiter, the pitching staff ace.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter would like to come back. Phillips and Leiter's
representatives, Alan and Randy Hendricks, have negotiated, and
there is a chance that Leiter may re-sign before he listens to
other offers.
</P>
<P>
   As for Piazza, it is anyone's guess where he will wind up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing is he has to decide whether he wants to come
back,'' Phillips said of Piazza, who hit .329 with 32 homers and
111 runs batted in for the Dodgers, Marlins and Mets this season,
and .348 with 23 homers and 76 RBIs in 109 games with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza's decision, whatever it is, probably won't come that
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going into a coma probably for a week,'' said Piazza, who
along with John Olerud (who finished second in the league in
hitting with a club-record .353 batting average), carried the Mets'
offense down the stretch. ``I need some rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza is almost certain to test the free-agent market. But he
admitted that he enjoyed his four months with the Mets. When asked
if he would re-sign with the Mets if the team made the right offer,
Piazza said: ``I really couldn't answer that. I don't know what the
right amount of money is.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips was asked once again if he still had a plan in which
Piazza and Todd Hundley could coexist in the lineup. ``I think that
there's a way, with a full spring training, that we can give it the
best possible chance,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley, for his part, said he did not know if he would be back.
His 34-game outfield experiment this season was declared a failure,
although at least partly because he was hitting under .200 and not
because he was that awful on defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have discussed a situation in which Piazza and Hundley
could share the catching duties and first base, with Olerud
learning to play left field next spring. But the Mets' defense
would suffer at two positions. And once the World Series ends, the
Mets can exercise the limited trade clause they agreed to with
Hundley last summer. Hundley, a two-time All-Star catcher, thinks
that is exactly what the Mets will do if they can re-sign Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   There are other potential free agents for the Mets to address _
Carlos Baerga, Tony Phillips, Lenny Harris, Masato Yoshii and Greg
McMichael. Phillips, who hit .223, will almost certainly not be
back. Neither, it appears, will Baerga, who made $4.67 million this
season but is not the hitter he once was and was being platooned at
second base by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Which means the Mets probably need a leadoff hitter, at least
one new outfielder, preferably one with power, and either a second
baseman or a third baseman, depending on whether Edgardo Alfonzo
shifts from third to second.
</P>
<P>
   Within their system, the Mets have Jay Payton, who could take
over in left field and perhaps bat leadoff, and Mike Kinkade, a
third baseman who was acquired for Bill Pulsipher and who has
impressed Manager Bobby Valentine. Paul Wilson, who pitched well at
Class AAA Norfolk in the later part of the season, might be able to
fight for a spot in the starting rotation.

 &HT;    Education jeopardized by Bush's voucher plans, MacKay warns
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, Fla. _ Buddy MacKay wants to make ``voucher'' a four
letter word. The Democratic gubernatorial candidate tells voters at
every stop that his opponent, Republican Jeb Bush, will use
vouchers to destroy public education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeb Bush believes in vouchers. He wants to take money away
from public schools and give the money to private schools,'' MacKay
tells a gathering of about 40 people in this tiny town east of
Tallahassee. ``I know that vouchers are wrong. They will devastate
the public school system.''
</P>
<P>
   With a school population of fewer than 4,000 and a total
population of fewer than 16,000, vouchers are not likely to have
much, if any, impact on Madison. But MacKay hopes vouchers will
have a tremendous impact on his struggling campaign.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay is getting significant help from Florida's teacher
unions, which have formed a political action committee called
Teachers for Better Public Education. Most of their help has been
in the form of a campaign commercial that shows classrooms and
supplies disappearing because vouchers took money away from public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Forbidden by law to work for a specific candidate, the ad simply
urges voters to be aware that vouchers are terrible and they should
know which candidate for governor supports vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush supports a limited program of vouchers that would be
available to parents who have children in ``chronically failing
schools.'' MacKay opposes all vouchers and says as governor he
would veto any voucher plan offered by the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Bush talked a great deal about school choice and
vouchers. Today, vouchers are but a whisper in his campaign. He
stresses over and over that they be available only to those whose
children are in desperately bad schools. In his speeches he now
calls them ``opportunity scholarships'' and will only grudgingly
use the word vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign insists that voters understand that vouchers are
but a small part of Bush's overall education plan. They say that
MacKay's mere opposition to vouchers is not enough to take away
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite Bush's attempt to distance himself from vouchers,
the issue appears to be gaining traction. Recently Bush made his
199th school visit to Atlantic Community High School in Delray
Beach. While there he was asked about vouchers. In fact, he asked
about them, from concerned teachers, students or parents at many of
his school visits.
</P>
<P>
   There is genuine worry that once the state begins even the
smallest of voucher programs, expansion will be inevitable. With
schools already straining because of having not enough money
teachers and parents fear that conditions will only get worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are really scared about this idea,'' MacKay said after
getting back on his campaign bus during a three-day ``Make a
Difference Tour'' from Pensacola to Jacksonville. ``When voters put
a name and a face to this issue, we'll win.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida students already have many options available to them if
they are in low performing schools. Parents can enroll their
children in magnet schools, charter schools and even teach their
children at home. Most school districts, including Palm Beach
County's, have some flexibility in allowing students to transfer to
other schools if they meet certain requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Even a form of vouchers exists in Florida. Any state resident
going to a private college or university gets a Florida Resident
Access Grant. There is no eligibility requirement other than being
a state resident. A student can go to any private school, religious
or otherwise. The voucher this year is worth $1,800.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay insists that is it not the same as the public school
voucher. ``Going to college is an option and the grant is part of a
public policy made years ago,'' he said. ``Parents are required to
send their children to school and anything we do to cause public
schools to become overcrowded by taking money away, which is what
these vouchers would do, is not good public policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Vouchers are a growing trend. In Milwaukee, about 1,500 children
from low income families get $4,700 to attend private schools.
Milwaukee's voucher program has been in existence since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The program also does exactly what opponents fear. When it was
started, the legislature allowed vouchers for just 1 percent of
Milwaukee's 103,000 students. In 1994 it was increased to 1.5
percent. In 1995 the program was expanded to include 15,000
students and gave them the right to go to religious schools. During
the same time period, the amount spent on public schools decreased
from 57 percent to 53 percent. The legislature increased spending
this year. A suit challenging whether vouchers could go to
religious schools was tossed out in June by the Wisconsin Supreme
Court, which found there were no significant church and state
issues.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Ohio Supreme Court heard arguments about whether
Cleveland's voucher program violates both the U.S. and Ohio
constitutions. Last year, the Ohio Court of Appeals struck down the
voucher law, ruling that it violates the U.S. Constitution and the
Ohio Constitution. The court ruled that because the law provides
``direct and substantial, non-neutral government aid to sectarian
schools,'' it has the primary effect of advancing religion.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, the School Choice Scholarships Foundation Inc.
is a private effort to give vouchers to 1,300 poor children in
impoverished schools. The foundation raises money and includes
among its board of directors former New York Gov. Hugh Carey,
Leslie Quick, Jr. chairman of the board of Quick &AMP; Reilly Group,
Frank Macchiarola, former chancellor of New York City public
schools, and other notables.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Tornillo, president of the FEA/United, describes the Bush
voucher idea as something that is ``shamefully willing to abandon
Florida's neediest schools by experimenting on our children with
untested, unproven voucher plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Dinnen, president of FTP/NEA, says that, ``instead of
abandoning these neglected schools, the state should be focusing
the resources necessary to give them equal footing with higher
performing schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush argues that his education plan will do just that. He wants
to grade schools from A to F and then work with failing schools to
improve their performance. He also believes that vouchers are not
only a way to help parents but they also will create competition
between public and private schools that will force public schools
to improve.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay says polls indicate that voters, especially mothers with
children in public schools, are leery of vouchers. Whether they are
leery enough to vote against Bush, MacKay won't know until election
day.

 &HT;    Jackson calls for investment in Appalachia's future
 &HT;    By Charlise Lyles
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NELSONVILLE, Ohio _ The needs of Appalachia and Harlem should be
on the radar screens of Wall Street and Congress much like their
concerns about the economies of troubled countries overseas, the
Rev. Jesse Jackson said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   To end Appalachia's relentless poverty, Jackson called for small
business development, public-private investment, philanthropy and
government incentive programs to aid businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street has 'red lined' Appalachia and Harlem,'' Jackson
said at an economic roundtable that ended the Rainbow/PUSH
Coalition's 10-day journey through Appalachia. Recalling slain
civil rights leader the Rev. Martin Luther King's ``Poor People's
Campaign,'' Jackson drew attention to the region's economic,
education, employment and housing needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When one speaks of the economic challenges of Appalachia, the
debate is de-racialized,'' he said. ``We could have the same debate
in Harlem. . . . Appalachia is not on Wall Street's mind. Harlem is
not on Wall Street's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're not here fighting Wall Street,'' Jackson said.
``Appalachia needs Wall Street. We must put forth a deal where
Appalachia develops and Wall Street expands, and everybody wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson called the roundtable as part of the Rainbow/PUSH
Coalition's Wall Street Project. Launched in January 1997, the
project aims to steer investment capital into underserved areas.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he plans to urge his buddy, President Clinton, to
conduct a town hall meeting here to discuss investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been having town hall meetings on race to discuss how
we feel about each other,'' Jackson said. ``But there's no budget
attached to touchy, feely. There is no more access to capital from
touchy, feely.''
</P>
<P>
   A day after the coalition drew between 2,500 and 5,000 marchers
here, Jackson convened about 40 state and federal bureaucrats,
business people, and nonprofit managers to devise long-term
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Bischak of the Appalachian Regional Commission said the
area's main economic challenge is to replace with high-paying
service jobs nearly 200,000 anufacturing jobs lost over the past
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   To boost private investment, Jackson urged residents to lobby
Congress for federal incentives similar to the export/import bank
and other U.S. foreign assistance programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We come to Appalachia to say that we must at least do as much
for our people here as we do for foreign allies and even some
adversaries,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Developer D. Duane Jack of Envision Dayton urged renovation of
old abandoned buildings that can qualify for a 20 percent federal
tax credit if listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Jack is looking to restore an old brewery on Ohio
33, converting into a a center for shops or other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dayton has one of the largest urban Appalachian populations,
but what we have is everyone moving out of downtown. Whether it be
Nelsonville or Dayton, we are leaving valuable things behind,''
said Jack, whose company is developing the West Third Project in
West Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Attracting private investment to the region is tough because
``Wall Street wants a 15 to 35 percent return on investment''
within a certain amount of time, said Tom J. Anderle, of Bartlett &AMP;
Co. in Cincinnati. Entrepreneurs with little experience can not
deliver that. Investors would have to be willing to give a company
more time to succeed, Anderle said.
</P>
<P>
   In six to eight weeks, Jackson said, the coalition plans to
convene a meeting of Wall Street investors here to continue
discussing investment strategies.

DEADLINE DEAL HAS INVIGORATED JOHNSON AND THE ASTROS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was something ornery and iffy about the pitching star
stuck in a funk earlier this year. Still, this was the coveted
Randy Johnson, a pitcher up to his mustache in power and the
potential to swing the balance in a playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every serious contender wanted him, the Yankees and the
Indians among them. But popping up like an unexpected visitor, the
Houston Astros caught everyone off guard by landing a No. 1 pitcher
for their rotation 10 minutes before the midnight deadline on July
31.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had been intrigued, but did not want to disrupt
their rhythm and passed. Perhaps through some less-than-savvy
negotiations by the Mariners, the Astros ended up with Johnson for
three minor league players. They won the auction and crossed their
fingers, hoping that a fresh start would right Johnson's groove and
improve his mood.
</P>
<P>
   Since the trade, the guy with the bounce in his step and the
snap in his fastball has been vintage Johnson. He ended the season
with a 10-1 record and 1.28 earned run average in Houston, and
provides the Astros with a left-hander to lean on as they begin
their National League Division Series against the San Diego Padres
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   With a lineup that includes Moises Alou, Jeff Bagwell and Craig
Biggio, the one thing the Astros lacked was an ace on the mound. By
acquiring Johnson, the Astros' first World Series appearance is not
so far-fetched anymore. In a three-of-five-game series, the Padres
could see Johnson twice. If the Astros advance to the
four-of-seven-game National League Championship Series, Johnson may
surface three times.
</P>
<P>
   His impact has already had multiple effects in Houston. As much
as the presence of Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa ignited fan interest
around the nation, nothing is bigger in Houston than the
6-foot-10-inch Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players and fans saw the organization go out and get a
player, when they hadn't done that in the past,'' Johnson said.
``They went out and got a player who could possibly put them over
the hump.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros did not have the 35-year-old Johnson when they were
overmatched by the Braves' impeccable pitching staff in the first
round of the playoffs a year ago. Before any rematch is considered,
the Astros have to take care of the Padres, whose late-season swoon
has put their playoff life in question.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres will counter Johnson with their best pitcher, Kevin
Brown, and rely on their unflappable closer, Trevor Hoffman, to
seal a lead. Although the Astros and the Padres have excellent
staffs _ ranking second and third, respectively, in team ERA in the
NL _ it is Johnson who has a 98-mile-an-hour fastball and a nasty
breaking ball, and provides his team with an intimidating edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody says he's scary,'' Astros Manager Larry Dierker said
on Sunday, as his team finished the season with a franchise-record
102d victory. ``I don't think scary is necessarily the word,
because he's always facing right-handed hitters. If you're
sidearming and left-handed, you're not going to scare that many
right-handed hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just awesome more than scary. I mean, he just throws the
ball by hitters. He throws breaking balls they can't hit.
Everybody's swinging and missing. When they do hit the ball, it's
usually some sort of a feeble groundout or fly ball. He just
overpowers them.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson understands what his reputation is and what expectations
are. So far, he has surpassed the high bar set for him, making any
doubts about his sulking nature disappear. In Seattle, a rift
between Johnson and management grew. One day, Johnson picked up his
cell phone and dialed his wife, Lisa. In the background of their
Seattle home, he could hear the faint sounds of a television. It
was Oprah Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was watching the show when a bulletin came across the
bottom of the screen like a storm warning or something,'' Johnson
said. ``It said that I had been traded to the Dodgers. She was
like, what? I had been assured that I wasn't going anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Johnson deeply wanted to be traded because it was clear
the Mariners were not interested in re-signing him for the money he
had in mind. Although the Dodger deal died, other offers surfaced
as the trading deadline neared. The Astros sneaked in and landed
Johnson. And he could not be more pleased.
</P>
<P>
   But don't let the sunnier disposition of Johnson fool you. On
game day, most of his teammates, and even his wife, dance
delicately around the menacing pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a pitcher, he has tremendous inner fire and a passion for
excellence,'' Dierker said. ``He's so extremely competitive that
the one problem that he might have is that if he starts to lose his
control, or somebody gets a cheap hit, or an umpire misses a call,
sometimes he has a little trouble remaining calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``But usually he's able to weather those little storms. Once he
gets rolling, he just mows them down.''

 &HT;    Gingrich to be on the stump for important Ohio district
 &HT;    By Jim Bebbington
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The U.S. House race that has generated some of
the closest contests in the past three elections is drawing
national politicians this time to try to tip the scale.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich is coming here Thursday to help
raise campaign funds for Lt. Gov. Nancy Hollister, Republican
candidate for the 6th Congressional District.
</P>
<P>
   Hollister is running against Democratic incumbent Ted Strickland
of Portsmouth. The winner of the last three 6th District elections
_ Strickland twice and Frank Cremeans in 1994 _ received 51 percent
of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get the message out that Nancy is being backed by
the nation's top conservatives,'' said Hollister spokeswoman
Rachael Sweeny. At the same time, House Democratic leader Richard
Gephardt of Missouri will be with Strickland on Thursday in Ross
County.
</P>
<P>
   The sprawling 6th District extends across southern Ohio from
southeastern Warren County to the eastern border.
</P>
<P>
   The district, however, does not include the site of Gingrich's
visit: NCR Country Club in Kettering.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is largely logistical,'' said Sweeny who said it's easier
for Gingrich to fly into Dayton International Airport and visit
here than it is to get him deep into the 6th District.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland said he is not surprised Gingrich is not coming into
the district. ``I don't think he's terribly popular in my
district,'' Strickland said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich is making a three-day swing through several
congressional races for fund-raising speeches. Despite the debate
under way in Congress over the fate of President Clinton,
Gingrich's office said his speeches will touch on that only in
passing. ``We're there to talk about Nancy Hollister,'' said Mike
Shields, Gingrich's political communications director.
</P>
<P>
   The breakfast will cost Hollister's supporters $150 per person,
or $500 for those wanting a photograph with Gingrich. Tickets can
be obtained from Hollister's campaign at (740) 775-8343.

 &HT;    Impact of Georges on Florida considerable but less severe than
other storms
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENSACOLA BEACH, Fla. _ What Jim Falbo dismissed as a minor
storm headed for Mississippi swung its broad right shoulder into
his beach house Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Water began flowing under his sliding glass door, three blocks
from the ocean, collecting to a depth of 2 inches in his living
room. The wind gusted, blowing off the side of a 14-story
condominium less than a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   As he hastily filled homemade sand bags, he began to wonder if
he should have ignored warnings to evacuate before Hurricane
Georges paid a call.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a point about 4 a.m. where we were thinking, `My
gosh, can we still get off the island?' '' said Falbo, who stuck
out the storm with his wife, Tina.
</P>
<P>
   Frantic bailing and good fortune allowed the Falbos and their
house to survive intact, but not before the storm blew down roofs
and trees, cut power to 90,000 people, and forced at least 200
emergency evacuations. There was one storm-related death.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the damage was less severe than previous hurricanes
that have struck the Panhandle in recent years, such as Opal. But
the impact was considerable for a storm whose eye was 110 miles to
the west.
</P>
<P>
   A 66-year-old Pensacola woman died when candles she had been
using in the power blackout caused a fire. The roof of a downtown
Pensacola building caved in, while three other structures suffered
lesser damage.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency rescues were necessary when a combination of storm
surge and rain caused flooding, not only on the coast but also
several miles inland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't every day I get calls from people saying, `I'm in
water up to my waist. Please come and get me,' '' said Pensacola
fire chief James Dixon. ``We've had areas flooded that generally
don't flood.''
</P>
<P>
   National guard troops using 6-wheeled vehicles were brought in
to rescue more than 200 people stranded in their homes, sometimes
using boats to reach them, said Suzanne Kahn, a spokeswoman at the
Escambia County Emergency Operations Center.
</P>
<P>
   Some surge-related flooding eased on Monday, but the threat of
further flooding remains. Parts of the Panhandle have already
received up to 15 inches of rain, and could see another 10 inches
before it's over. The Escambia River is expected to crest Wednesday
at 5 feet above flood stage.
</P>
<P>
   Police began allowing residents of coastal islands back to visit
their homes temporarily Monday afternoon, but closed access at
nightfall. Pensacola Beach is on the western end of Santa Rosa
Island, which extends about 50 miles east from Pensacola to Destin.
Bridges to Santa Rosa and Perdido Key, another barrier island west
of Pensacola, were closed during the storm but reopened Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sand completely covered some roads near the beach. Odd debris
was flung outside homes in some places: wooden planks, a living
room chair, a woman's shoe. At Perdido Key, high winds ripped the
roof off a condominium and the gulf flooded several other
buildings, including the landmark Flora-Bama Lounge, which
straddles the Florida-Alabama state line.
</P>
<P>
   A 5-foot storm surge and wave action also destroyed piers and
sank or beached boats in what normally are protected waters.
</P>
<P>
   Roads that had flooded throughout the western Panhandle,
including Interstate 10 near the Alabama state line, were being
reopened. Creeks were overflowing their banks and officials were
worried that rivers in the western Panhandle would begin flooding
in the next several days.
</P>
<P>
   Gulf Power Co. crews worked to restore electrical service to
90,000 homes and businesses in Escambia, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa
counties. Most schools and government offices were closed Monday.
Officials urged businesses not to open.
</P>
<P>
   A tornado-like waterspout Monday came ashore near Panama City
Beach, nearly 100 miles east of Pensacola, and destroyed five homes
and damaged seven, but no one was injured, said Bay County
spokesman Charles Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in the Keys _ hit by Georges last week _ up to 180
National Guard troops along with trucks and helicopters were being
moved to help about 100 guardsmen already on duty. A base camp was
being set up at Eglin Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   The already-waterlogged southwest coast, where officials feared
massive flooding had Georges gone there, was largely spared.
</P>
<P>
   Crucial was a slight westward jog Georges took the day before it
passed through the Keys, which then put its subsequent course well
out into the Gulf of Mexico instead of closer in by Florida's west
coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the difference between what we're dealing with today
and a major, major, major, major disaster,'' said Director of
Emergency Management Joe Myers.
</P>
<P>
   Georges' total tally in Florida won't be known for another day
or two, until the storm leaves the area. The path it takes over
land will affect how much flooding Escambia, Santa Rosa and
Okaloosa counties experience.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever flooding damage occurs there will be added to $200
million in insured losses in the Keys, a figure announced by
Insurance Commissioner Bill Nelson Monday in a visit to Monroe
County. About $120 million will be borne by the state's windstorm
pool, another $50 million by the federal flood insurance program
and the remaining $30 million by private insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not very much for the industry to swallow,'' spokesman
Don Pride said. ``This should have no effect on the industry in
Florida or their rates in Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more fortunate homeowners, Rick Carraway, who has
lived in Pensacola Beach most of his life, said he decided not to
leave because Georges did not appear serious.
</P>
<P>
   He did get out before Opal, but most of his possessions were
ruined before he could get back to his house, he said. He did not
want that to happen this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not as bad as Opal, but I was a little concerned when
we were surrounded by water,'' he said. ``It was mostly rainwater.
The tide was about half a block away. We were fortunate.''

SILVER LINING SEEN IN MAJOR JAPANESE BANKRUPTCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Financial markets on Monday virtually ignored the
financial fallout of Japan's largest postwar bankruptcy, rallying
instead on progress in a bank-reform plan viewed as an important
step toward overcoming a severe recession.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ripple effects of Japan Leasing Corp.'s bankruptcy
could cause a string of financial collapses among the dominant
Liberal Democratic Party's basic supporters, some analysts saw a
silver lining. They said Japan Leasing's downfall, announced late
Sunday, appeared to reflect a new willingness by the Liberal
Democrats to let big, politically important businesses fail if they
were insolvent, rather than bail them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pushed into bankruptcy without political consideration
and that may be viewed as a signal of the start of resolution,''
said Ryuji Konishi, an independent financial consultant and former
banking executive. He added that the Liberal Democrats were forced
by the opposition to abandon their traditional way of negotiating
in secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have to continue working behind a curtain, it doesn't
help to solve the problem,'' he said. ``We have to face reality
with more courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese stocks, which seesawed last week and fell 3.39 percent
Friday, rallied Monday despite the news about Japan Leasing. The
benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose 1.35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The markets also appeared to pay little attention to the
government's acknowledgment on Sunday that Japan's economy will
probably shrink in the current fiscal year by nearly 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The severity of such a downturn is likely to cripple many
corporations and expand the amount of the country's bad debt.
</P>
<P>
   Japan Leasing is the largest affiliate of the Long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan, a large and frail institution that has been verging
on collapse. Over the weekend, politicians reached a banking accord
and agreed to temporarily nationalize Long-Term Credit.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians hope that the banking accord, long awaited by the
financial world, will be approved by the Parliament before its
current session ends Oct. 7. Lawmakers will also draft laws to
create a new government fund _ larger than one established in
February that will now be abolished _ to recapitalize weak banks,
and to provide for the nationalization of Long-Term Credit.
</P>
<P>
   Japan Leasing's collapse will force as many as 160 lenders to
write off much of their total of 2.18 trillion yen, or $16.3
billion, in loans to the company. As a result, profits are expected
to fall at many Japanese financial institutions, including major
banks.
</P>
<P>
   Many financial analysts also expect Japan Landic Corp. and
Nippon Enterprise Development Corp., two other affiliates of
Long-Term Credit, to follow the same path as Japan Leasing.
Long-Term Credit had hoped to forgive $82 million to Japan Landic
and $1.2 billion to Nippon Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say that these collapses could lead to a shortage
of money in the financial system as well as some painful
adjustments in the financial industry and the economy at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to make banks increasingly cautious,'' said Brian
Waterhouse, a banking analyst at HSBC Securities Japan Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Banks are already facing difficulties borrowing money because of
the banking industry's weaknesses, and that has threatened to
create money shortages that could disrupt the financial system.
</P>
<P>
   The money-shortage possibility has been a major concern in the
financial community here, and Japanese news media reported Monday
that the government was making arrangements to lend from its stock
of U.S. Treasury securities to Japanese banks that are having
difficulties raising dollars overseas. Those banks could then use
the Treasuries as collateral in exchange for dollar loans. A
Finance Ministry spokesman, however, denied there were such plans.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Other reports that the Bank of Japan was making available some
of its foreign currency reserves to Japanese banks through special
arrangements were denied by the Bank of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest losers in the collapse of Japan Leasing will
be the agricultural cooperatives, which lend to farmers and
businesses in the countryside. The rural areas have been loyal
supporters of the dominant Liberal Democratic Party, and in the
July elections, the Liberal Democrats did best in rural
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Democrats fought to rescue Long-Term Credit, which
had earlier declared that it would forgive its 250 billion yen, or
$1.9 billion, in debt to Japan Leasing. But the opposition groups
fought back, forcing the Liberal Democrats to abandon their rescue
plans. The result is that Long-Term Credit will not forgive any
debts, and the agricultural cooperatives will be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Agricultural cooperatives have extended an estimated 400 billion
yen, or nearly $3 billion, in loans to Japan Leasing. So its
collapse could touch off a wave of failures among the smaller and
weaker agricultural cooperatives, and affect various local
economies.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Democrats appeared to accept that. Hasuhisa
Shiozaki, a Liberal Democratic member of Parliament, acknowledged
that there might be some fallout among the agricultural
cooperatives but said overall it would not be fatal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone's been making too big a fuss about the
possibility of disorder coming out from Japan Leasing,'' Shiozaki
said.
</P>
<P>
   As the financial troubles force the restructuring of the
financial landscape here, companies are creating new alliances and
tie-ups. Monday, Tokai Bank and Asahi Bank announced they would
team up in a broad array of businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the alliance a ``virtual merger,'' the banks said they
would exchange shares and jointly develop financial products, in a
move that could ultimately bring about a merger that would create
the second-largest Japanese bank.

be soon be illuminating the genetic basis of heart disease. (Frank

AMP STEPS UP EFFORTS TO FEND OFF ALLIED SIGNAL TAKEOVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fighting a hostile takeover bid of $44.50 a share from Allied
Signal Inc., AMP Inc. announced a plan Monday to buy back as many
as 30 million shares of its common stock for $55 a share.
</P>
<P>
   AMP's counteroffer is intended to thwart Allied Signal's $9.7
billion offer for the entire company. By offering some shareholders
a higher price for their shares, AMP, a leading maker of electrical
equipment and connectors, is seeking to appease investors and gain
some time to illustrate that its management can improve
profitability and lift the company's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts offered mixed views. But investors showed little
enthusiasm Monday, as shares of AMP fell $2.1875, or 5.6 percent,
to $37.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.6 billion cash offer for approximately 14 percent of the
outstanding shares of AMP places the company's value at
approximately a 33 percent premium above its current stock price
and exceeds Allied Signal's $890 million tender for 20 million AMP
shares, which would give Allied a 9 percent stake in the company.
Allied's tender expires on Friday. The AMP offer, expected to begin
next week, expires in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's much more value here than $44.50,'' Robert Ripp, AMP's
chairman and chief executive, said Monday. He added that the
company had $3.25 billion of financing available from Credit Suisse
First Boston and Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, which could be used
for refinancing existing debt and working capital needs, as well as
a stock buyback. Details of the repurchase offer will be mailed to
shareholders next week.
</P>
<P>
   Allied, a maker of aerospace and automotive products, said that
AMP's tender would not affect its offer to purchase the company.
AMP, which is based in Harrisburg, Pa., had earlier rejected
Allied's bid as too low.
</P>
<P>
   Allied's offer has been blocked by an AMP anti-takeover
provision, which currently goes into effect if anyone buys more
than 10 percent of the shares. Allied, based in Morristown, N.J.,
has gone to court in an effort to lift that provision. Monday a
federal judge in Philadelphia said he would make a ruling soon.
</P>
<P>
   AMP's plan to finance the share repurchase with bank debt would
substantially increase the company's debt. Such leveraging up, or
increasing the amount of debt in a company's capital structure to
buy back shares, was a common tool used in the 1980s by companies
seeking to lift their stock prices and thus thwart takeover
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   If investors sought to tender shares to AMP at its higher price,
that would also reduce the number of shares available for purchase
by Allied, and could leave AMP with a smaller, more loyal investor
base, willing to give the company a chance to improve performance.
</P>
<P>
   But some shareholders were not impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not comfortable getting a bribe for 14 percent'' of the
company, said Mike Donnelly, vice president and senior portfolio
manager at Federated Investors. ``We're still worried about the
other 86 percent. We don't see this as a cure-all and we still feel
Allied's bid is more reasonable.'' He added that Federated had
tendered its two million shares to Allied.
</P>
<P>
   Donnelly also said he had more confidence in the track record of
Allied's management than in AMP's team headed by Ripp, a former IBM
vice president and treasurer with limited operational management
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock market is discounting the uncertainty'' of the
outcome of the legal issues, said Michael Bunyaner, an analyst with
CIBC Oppenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp. and Moody's Investors Service
lowered the ratings on the company's commercial paper program as a
result of the planned debt increase.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The move would also raise AMP's level of debt to about 60
percent of its total capitalization, compared with its current
level in the 20 percent range, Andrew Watt, a Standard &AMP; Poor's
analyst, said. The move to increase debt levels represents a
significant change for a company that has been ``debt averse in
recent years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the downgrades, AMP's debt remains at an
investment-grade level and Watt felt confident the company would
not have problems with repayment.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the share repurchase, AMP announced plans to create a
trust with 25 million AMP shares. The trust is intended to free
operating cash flow currently used to provide funds for cash
benefit and compensation requirements of about $1 billion over the
next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   AMP's tender offer was just the latest salvo in its effort to
thwart Allied Signal's efforts to buy the company. On Sunday,
Allied Signal promised not to dismiss AMP employees in Pennsylvania
earning $50,000 or less for at least a year if its takeover offer
succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, AMP countered by holding an employee rally at the
Pennsylvania State Legislature in Harrisburg. About 500 employees
attended, Ripp said.

CLINTON SEES PROGRESS, URGES MIDEAST LEADERS TO RETURN TO
WASHINGTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seizing on apparent progress in the Mideast peace
talks, President Clinton met Monday with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and urged
the leaders to return next month to hammer out the final details of
any agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute meeting at the White House was hastily arranged
after it became clear that the leaders were moving closer to
agreement on a number of issues, including how much West Bank
territory Israel would turn over to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   While administration officials refused to comment on the details
of any proposal, they confirmed there had been a narrowing of
differences after an 18 month stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that we all agree that we have made progress on the
path to peace,'' Clinton said after the meeting. ``There has been
significant narrowing of the gaps between the two parties across a
range of issues that were in the U.S. initiative we've been working
on for months.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, standing with the two in the Oval Office, said he
directed Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and chief negotiator
Dennis Ross to go to the Mideast to iron out remaining differences.
The president said he has asked the two leaders to return to
Washington in mid-October to conclude the process.
</P>
<P>
   Albright had met with the two leaders Sunday evening in New York
and concluded that they were close enough on key issues to warrant
a meeting with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think only the president of the United States can really
give it that sense of urgency, and also, for him to say to them
that no matter how much we all can do, that the decision is
theirs,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright declined to elaborate on where the two sides had drawn
closer, only saying there were many pieces in a comprehensive peace
package.
</P>
<P>
   The Secretary of State, aware of the many fits and starts of the
Mideast talks, also was cautious in describing the level of
progress saying the term ``breakthrough'' gets overused.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Netanyahu said that the sides had
significantly narrowed the gap on how much land Israel would
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're getting close to finalizing an agreement, and
it's time for the leaders to meet,'' Netanyahu, said on NBC-TV's
``Today Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu said that the two sides had been discussing a proposal
whereby Israel would hand over an additional 13 percent of its West
Bank lands, on top of the 27 percent already promised to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   However, three percent of the additional lands would be turned
into a nature preserve, under Israeli military control. The nature
preserve would essentially serve as a buffer zone and no Israeli or
Palestinian construction would be permitted.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu said that before any agreement is reached the
Palestinians must convince Israel that any territory given back
would not become a base for terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for us the crucial thing is how do we protect ourselves?''
he said. ``How do we protect our people against terrorism that
could be, in Israeli terms, five blocks away, like in New York
City, five blocks, six blocks away?''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat declined to answer questions about how much security his
side was willing to guarantee. After his White House meeting, the
aging Palestinian leader flew to New York to address the United
Nations. He is scheduled to return Tuesday to Washington for
additional talks.
</P>
<P>
   In the first podium speech by a Palestinian during a General
Assembly debate, Arafat asked for support for an independent state.
``I would like to call upon all of you ... to stand by our people.
This independent Palestinian state must be established as an
embodiment of the right of our people to self-determination,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat stopped short of announcing his intention to declare a
Palestinian state in May, 1999, the date interim agreements with
Israel expire.
</P>
<P>
   The carefully worded call for international support came after
several days of intensive behind-the-scenes effort by U.S. and
Israeli diplomats to push Arafat to excise a sentence in an earlier
draft that read: ``Or we will have no choice but to unilaterally
declare the establishment of a Palestinian state.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel had said that the sentence would harm efforts to restart
peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   It was the U.S. negotiators who first proposed that Israel turn
over an additional 13 percent of the lands captured by Israel
during the 1967 Six Day War.
</P>
<P>
   However, the peace talks bogged down for months because of the
hardline stands of Netanyahu and the Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
   The recent thaw in the negotiation, with the possibility of a
new peace accord, would be a boost for Clinton who has been mired
in a domestic scandal that threatens his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was during his meeting with Arafat last January, when
the scandal first broke, that Clinton was peppered with questions
about his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that the intensity of the scandal coverage is
receding, the president was not asked a single question about the
Lewinsky matter when he faced reporters after his meeting with
Arafat and Netanyahu.

RED SOX HOPE TO CONTINUE DOING WHAT WORKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND--Jimy Williams, who holds a BS in animal science, had
no patience for a history lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that the Red Sox come into Tuesday's division series
opener against the Cleveland Indians having lost their last 13
postseason games, dating back to Game 6 of the 1986 World Series,
Williams looked blankly at the person attempting to enlighten him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was their history?'' he asked. ``I wasn't here. I was
somewhere else. In my own little world, somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   In the universe inhabited by the Red Sox, few people came into
this season believing that when the leaves began to turn, the Olde
Towne Team would turn up here to face the defending AL champions in
a best-of-five preliminary to the league title and possible World
Series date.
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect to the Red Sox shortstop, Nomar Garciaparra
can claim all he wants that the moment he stepped on a practice
diamond this spring, he knew that this Red Sox team had a chance to
be special.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind Nomar. Nostradamus would have hesitated to make that
forecast in March, when Mo Vaughn was being hauled into court, and
Jeff Frye's knee imploded, and Bret Saberhagen was learning how to
pitch with his fingers crossed, and the Red Sox were trying to
piece together an outfield with two Darrens and a Damon, and Dan
Duquette's search for a right-handed power hitter included a
rust-covered Danny Tartabull, and Tom Gordon was an untested closer
and Dennis Eckersley a discarded one, and Jim Leyritz was told two
days before camp broke that he wouldn't be catching, and the
rotation consisted of Pedro and the Four Question Marks.
</P>
<P>
   To suggest that this bunch would win more games (92) in the
American League than any team but the Yankees, who set a record for
most wins ever by an AL team, didn't require a leap of faith. It
called for a bungee jump of blind belief, with no safety net in
sight.
</P>
<P>
   And yet it worked, beginning with what will long be remembered
as the Good Friday miracle, when the Sox came back from five runs
down against the Seattle Mariners by scoring seven runs in the last
of the ninth, the last four coming on a grand slam by Vaughn,
without a single out being recorded.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a really, really big game for us,'' said Williams,
who is not in the habit of issuing such citations.
</P>
<P>
   Eckersley, who has been privy to more postseasons than anyone
else in a Red Sox uniform, said that for teams to win, there have
to be surprises. This team abounded in them.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez was expected to contend for the Cy Young Award,
but who could have imagined that in some precincts, closer Gordon
is viewed as even more deserving. Saberhagen went from iffy No. 5
starter to dependable 15-game winner. Darren Lewis and Damon Buford
didn't make an error in center field all season, and both hit
beyond anything they'd ever done before. Mike Benjamin, whose
personal highlight reel previously consisted of just a week's worth
of hits against the Cubs, hit almost 100 points higher than his
lifetime average.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn made some accusations against the front office worthy of
the X-Files, but never lost sight of the larger goal. Garciaparra,
of course, made his Rookie of the Year season look like a warmup
act.
</P>
<P>
   Someone mentioned to Williams that all the preseason pickers
mocked the Red Sox chances. He shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't read 'em,'' he said. ``We just try and compete on a
daily basis. We've got some good kids here who leave it on the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good group of kids, blue-collar kids. They've achieved, but
they've not overachieved. We feel good about ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   And how's this for an achievement. When the Red Sox take the
field Tuesday afternoon against the Indians, they will do so as
favorites to advance to the next round. That's what investing $75
million in Martinez can do for a club.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Red Sox were swept three straight by the Indians in
1995. But only three members of that Sox team are back--Vaughn,
John Valentin and Tim Wakefield. The Indians have only nine
returnees from their '95 team, which won the AL pennant.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the more recent history between the clubs, and you see
that the Red Sox took 8 of 11 from the Indians this season. Two of
those wins belong to Martinez, who has a 1.44 ERA against these
Cleveland mashers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my year,'' said the 19-game winner, who will face
Indians righthander Jaret Wright, the 22-year-old who was a modest
12-10 this season but last fall as a rookie won three times in the
postseason and pitched brilliantly in Game 7 of the World Series,
though he did not get a decision.
</P>
<P>
   How to match such a storybook season?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully,'' he said wryly, ``at the end of that storybook it
said, `To be continued.'''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, meanwhile, has never pitched in a game of such
consequence. He comes into this game having gone just 1-3 with a
4.15 ERA in September, his only losing month of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just one of those things,'' said Indians manager Mike
Hargrove, when asked if perhaps Martinez's record suggests he
wasn't as dominating now as he was when he faced the Indians
earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at what he's done in his career, and you realize he
is one of the best pitchers in the game. He continues to be so,
whether he went 1-3 or 30(cq)-1. He's still a very quality
front-line pitcher, and you can't expect anything but his best
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox hope form holds true. This is one time they don't
need any surprises.

INVESTORS FEAR TROUBLE AT ANOTHER HEDGE FUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN and PETER TRUELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A consortium of big Wall Street banks completed a
huge-scale rescue package for Long-Term Capital Management on
Monday night, but investors' anxiety rose about a second hedge fund
in possible trouble because of bad bets in turbulent markets.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the financial viability of the second fund,
Convergence Asset Management, centered on whether that fund had
made the same kinds of miscalculations as Long-Term Capital. Both
funds, based in Greenwich, Conn., are run by former star traders at
Salomon Brothers and use similar strategies.
</P>
<P>
   There were some signs that rich investors, scared by huge losses
at Long-Term Capital, were reassessing their investments in hedge
funds, the large and lightly regulated pools of capital that have
drawn intense attention in recent days. Congressional committees
scheduled hearings for Thursday into what happened at Long-Term
Capital and whether it posed a risk to market stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in business,'' Andrew Fisher, the managing partner
of Convergence Asset Management, said in an interview on Monday.
``We have taken some body blows, but we have not fallen to the mat.
We have met every margin call and we still have a reasonable amount
of free cash for just this type of event.''
</P>
<P>
   While he refused to say how much Convergence's capital had
declined from an original $500 million, Fisher emphasized that his
fund, formed in March, remains liquid, maintaining about 25 percent
of its resources in cash. Outflows are not a problem, Fisher said,
as his investors are committed to leave their investments with him
for close to three years.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street lawyers representing the consortium of banks and
brokerage firms that rescued Long-Term Capital Management hammered
out a final agreement on Monday night at the law firm of Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher &AMP; Flom in Manhattan. The rescue plan,
originally put at $3.5 billion, may now be running as high as $3.65
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the rescue operation, hastily arranged last week
at meetings orchestrated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
agreed to buy 90 percent of the hedge fund, which is running out of
money to support its billions in market bets.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 firms _ which have appointed Goldman, Sachs, J.P. Morgan,
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the Travelers Group and the Swiss bank
UBS A.G. as their oversight team _ transmitted the funds to
Long-Term Capital late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very unhappy set of circumstances,'' said a senior Wall
Street executive involved in the bailout, who refused to be
identified by name.
</P>
<P>
   The rescuing institutions have agreed to commit their capital
for as long as three years, according to people involved in the
effort. Their objectives are to reduce the size of Long-Term
Capital's enormous portfolio of securities, derivatives and forward
contracts _ positions that at the end of August totaled $1.25
trillion.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year time frame for completing that task reflects the
reality that Long-Term Capital made such heavy bets in some bond
and equity markets that liquidating its portfolio all at once would
almost certainly send prices sharply lower in already fragile
markets.
</P>
<P>
   The senior Wall Street executive involved in the bailout said on
Monday that his firm's key goal was to put the best risk-management
people in place at Long-Term Capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to have the best possible chance to protect the
capital we put in,'' he said, ``and hopefully get out with a
profit.'' He emphasized that the three-year commitment should allow
time to turn Long-Term Capital's fortunes around. ``Our people are
going to try to capture the value in that portfolio. Put really
outstanding people in and make sure the capital is protected.''
</P>
<P>
   This executive said he saw no alternative to the private-sector
rescue as organized by the Fed, though he mentioned that many of
his Wall Street colleagues disagreed. ``I don't know what the
alternative was,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It also now seems likely, according to people involved in the
rescue, that a small group of the executives at Long-Term Capital
may face personal bankruptcy as a result of the fund's losses.
Their equity, along with that of previous partners in the fund, has
been reduced to 10 percent of the value of the fund as part of the
rescue agreement. A spokesman for Long-Term Capital declined to
comment Monday on questions regarding personal bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the House Banking Committee scheduled hearings
Thursday morning, with Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve
chairman, scheduled to testify. William McDonough, president of the
New York Federal Reserve Bank, who helped organize the bailout of
Long-Term Capital, has also been asked to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members have expressed concerns about how Long-Term
Capital used a seemingly limitless flow of bank loans to build up a
securities portfolio that by the end of August totaled about 50
times its paid-in capital base. Government regulators and members
of Congress have also said that they planned to investigate how a
single speculative fund catering to rich investors could threaten
the stability of the financial system, requiring a bailout on such
a scale.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, and the House panel's chairman, said,
``The committee, which has the responsibility for oversight of the
Federal Reserve system, will want to explore the systemic risks
involved in Long-Term Capital Management's strategies.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Hayes, a finance expert at Harvard Business School, said
he would be surprised if the government failed to enact some kind
of regulatory supervision of hedge funds. ``I am shocked at the
size of the bets they made and the leverage,'' Hayes said. ``It
cries out for regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin sought to reassure
investors on Monday that the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital
would not lead to a broader financial crisis or a severe decline in
bank loans that would create a national credit shortage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see why that should happen,'' Rubin said in response
to a reporter's question. ``I think that the issues are indicative
of the kinds of problems that the world and international community
and financial authorities are dealing with as the world works
itself through a very difficult time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin is chairman of the President's Working Group on Financial
Markets, which was established after the 1987 stock market crash.
He said on Friday that he had asked the agencies in that group _
which include the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department and the
Securities and Exchange Commission _ to submit a report on hedge
funds.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC chairman, Arthur Levitt, speaking to reporters in New
York on Monday, also indicated that his agency intended to
investigate the circumstances surrounding Long-Term Capital's
failure and the impact that it might have on investors in other
hedge funds. He declined to comment further.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Juan Gonzalez did not want to discuss recent history.
In the 1996 division series, he hit five home runs and helped the
Texas Rangers scare a New York Yankees team that went on to win the
World Series. But to Gonzalez, those four games are memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``My great playoff in '96 is history,'' Gonzalez said Monday.
``Right now is a new year and a new playoff and I'm preparing
myself to do the best I can for my team tomorrow night. It's the
same history, different year.''
</P>
<P>
   To dispatch the Rangers, whom they meet at Yankee Stadium in
Game 1 of another division series Tuesday night, the Yankees must
limit the effect of Gonzalez. He hit .318 with 45 homers and 157
runs batted in this season and is the favorite to win the American
League Most Valuable Player Award.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Yankees this season, he batted .326 with four homers
and 12 RBIs. In his career, Gonzalez has a .296 average, 21 homers
and 73 RBIs versus the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our key man,'' Rangers catcher Ivan Rodriguez said.
``He's a great player. He's not the only player. We all have to
play hard.''
</P>
<P>
   David Wells, Tuesday night's starter for the Yankees, has
pinpoint control and will probably work around Gonzalez if the
situation allows. Will Clark, who bats behind Gonzalez, has a
bruised big toe on his right foot and that could prevent him from
striding into the ball, which could help the Yankees avoid
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gonzalez will surely bat in crucial situations with a
chance to dominate the series as he and Bernie Williams, his friend
from Puerto Rico, did in 1996. A smile crept across Gonzalez's face
when he talked about New York's 114 regular-season victories
meaning nothing when the postseason begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect the New York Yankees,'' Gonzalez said. ``They're a
great ball club. Right now, it's different. It's three out of
five.''

MATADORS DEFENSE: NO OPTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ From air assault to ground attack.
</P>
<P>
   A week after being passed upon nearly at will, Cal State
Northridge has less than a week to prepare for the most dreaded
offensive system in college football. It's the option, and Southern
Utah runs it with a full-house backfield. After having Monday off,
CSUN begins preparations for it today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be tough when you only have a short time to prepare,''
CSUN coach Ron Ponciano said. ``It's totally different than what we
did against (Eastern Washington).''
</P>
<P>
   It means, just for the week, the Matadors (2-1) must learn a
different defensive style in which keeping an assignment is
paramount to defending the run successfully.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Utah (1-2) is averaging 317 yards rushing per game and
the Thunderbirds do it by making big plays with numerous runners.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Matt Cannon leads the attack with 421 yards, but
five players have broken a run for at least 35 yards. CSUN might
catch a break with Southern Utah fullback Brook Madsen, who will
miss the game with an arm injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been pretty good up front,'' Southern Utah coach C.
Ray Gregory said of the Matadors. ``They have a solid linebacking
corps and the corners are good at defending.'
</P>
<P>
   __ No ranking, little respect: The respect CSUN wanted to see in
the polls after its 38-35 win against Eastern Washington didn't
come Monday. The Matadors haven't been ranked in their Division
I-AA history.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, CSUN did nothing more than make the ``others receiving
votes'' list in the Sports Network and ESPN/USA Today polls for the
second consecutive week. In the Sports Network poll, CSUN is listed
26th, just missing the Top 25. In the ESPN/USA Today poll, the
Matadors are 27th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I voted for them in the Top 25 (in the ESPN/USA Today
poll),'' Gregory said. ``As far as I'm concerned, they're leading
the Big Sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Big Sky brethrens Montana and Northern Arizona are ranked ahead
of CSUN in both polls. But Gregory has gotten a first-hand look at
the best. The Thunderbirds (1-2) beat No. 22/No. 21 (ESPN/USA
Today) Montana and have lost to No. 2/No. 1 McNeese State and No.
11/No. 13 Western Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   __ CSUN's Swanson noticed: It must have been a weak week for
defensive players in the Big Sky Conference. Despite the Matadors
allowing 502 yards of offense, CSUN linebacker Brennen Swanson was
named the league's Defensive Player of the Week.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is a reason for Swanson's selection. He made
eight tackles, including two for losses in CSUN's win. Both tackles
for loss came on Eastern Washington's last two plays from scrimmage
to secure the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Weber State's Morgan Welch (217 yards rushing) was the Offensive
Player of the Week and Idaho State's Daronn Finley (97-yard kickoff
return for touchdown) was named Special Teams Player of the Week.

BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB OFFERS HMO DEAL FOR EXCLUSIVE DRUG USE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A proposal in which Bristol-Myers Squibb would pay
an L.A.-based managed care company $1 million a month to give
preference to five of its drugs could threaten physician authority,
doctors and competitors say.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement, outlined in a draft proposal between Squibb and
Woodland Hills-based Foundation Health Systems Inc., is the latest
version of a practice known as rebating, in which pharmaceutical
companies compensate health care groups for making high-volume
purchases of their drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed arrangement, Foundation Health would instruct
doctors to select Squibb drugs when prescribing medicine for
patients in five therapeutic categories. The categories range from
high cholesterol to bacterial infection.
</P>
<P>
   But by telling physicians which drugs to use rather than
allowing them to select independently or from several choices, the
health plan reduces the doctor's decision-making authority, critics
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Granted it's not in the nature of managed care to encourage
freedom of choice,'' said Dr. H. Rex Greene, president of the Los
Angeles County Medical Association. ``But we (shouldn't) prescribe
by pharmaceutical manufacturer, but by indication and our own
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   If enacted, physicians treating Foundation Health members could
prescribe non-Squibb drugs within the five categories, but the
medicine would be covered by Foundation Health only if approved by
an appeals group within the company.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Drake, director of pharmacy at Health Net, which, with more
than 2 million California members, is Foundation Health's largest
plan, said the spirit behind the proposal is nothing new while the
particulars might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably just a step beyond what everybody else has done
to date,'' Drake said.
</P>
<P>
   Drake said volume is no longer enough to wrangle significant
discounts from drug makers. Pharmaceutical companies want
guaranteed market share within a health plan, he said, and giving
drugs preferred status is a way to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only through limiting first choices that you can get
bigger market share and get substantial discounts,'' he said.
``(But) we'd only do that where the particular drug has clinical
outcomes better or equal to other drugs. We wouldn't start with an
inferior drug.''
</P>
<P>
   Other area health plans, however, say they have steered away
from such deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not endorse the concept of having one drug per class,''
said Elise Anderson, a spokeswoman for Woodland Hills-based Blue
Cross of California. ``Typically we'd have three to four, and we've
always maintained in our formulary that a physician can write on a
prescription: Dispense as written.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokespersons for Kaiser Permanente, Prudential HealthCare,
CareAmerica Health Plans and its parent, Blue Shield of California,
all say they do not have any arrangements with drug companies
similar to what has been proposed between Squibb and Foundation
Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do negotiate with pharmaceutical manufacturers but not in
the manner they seem to be,'' said Kathleen Barco, a spokeswoman
for Kaiser Permanente. ``Our (deals) have to be competitive, but
you've got to leave the choice in the doctors' hands.'' &QL;

GARNES OUT FOR GIANTS' TOUGH TEST IN TAMPA   
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ It was an efficient victory in San
Diego, one that made the Giants feel self-assured. But injuries and
the formidable nature of their next assignment have impinged on the
sense of conquest.
</P>
<P>
   Up next for the Giants (2-2) is another road trip, to Tampa,
Fla., for the first of five games against playoff teams from a year
ago. And Monday, the Giants learned that they would face the
Buccaneers on Sunday without strong safety Sam Garnes, who has a
stress fracture in his right foot.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how long Garnes will be sidelined, though it is
considered a major injury. Also, linebacker Jessie Armstead may sit
out the game. Armstead, hampered by a right ankle he injured in the
opener, will be examined Tuesday by the team physician, who may
recommend that he sit out so the injury can heal.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing Garnes will be complicated by the injury to free
safety Tito Wooten, who sat out Sunday's game in San Diego with a
hamstring problem. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wooten, however, is said to be close to ready. If so, that would
allow Percy Ellsworth, who started in Wooten's place against the
Chargers, to slide over to Garnes' position.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jim Fassel did not dwell on any personnel specifics
Monday. As his players did, he had a great sense of accomplishment
because the Giants had avoided the disaster of a 1-3 start and had
played a game in the style that proved so successful last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We zeroed in on the kind of things we do to win football
games,'' Fassel said. ``And we did them _ we won the turnover
battle, we ran the football, we stopped the run, we knocked down
the penalties and we were patient on offense.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the Giants could afford to rest Monday, they could not
relax. After two West Coast trips and a ``Monday Night Football''
game in the span of 15 days, the Giants prepare to play at Tampa
Bay's new Raymond James Stadium, where the Buccaneers made their
debut two weeks ago in a victory against Chicago. At home, the
Buccaneers have won 12 of their last 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Tampa Bay game is going to be our toughest game of the
year,'' said Fassel, repeating publicly something he has said
privately for weeks. ``After two long road trips and playing Monday
night, to go down there against a good football team is going to be
a strong test for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the strength of the coming challenge only makes the
Giants' victory in San Diego more meaningful. The Giants will at
least be heading to Tampa with some confidence in their attack.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Chargers, the Giants' offensive line played its best
game of the season. Also, the Giants' running back situation
finally looked as it appeared to be designed in the off-season,
with Gary Brown getting the bulk of the carries and Tiki Barber
playing mostly on third downs.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel would not say Monday whether Brown, who had 66 yards on
20 carries Sunday, was the team's new starting running back, or if
he would get the majority of the carries against the Buccaneers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary did an excellent job, but I told the backs the same thing
_ nobody has clearly defined themselves as the best,'' Fassel said.
``I'm not going to anoint somebody. I don't like just handing the
job to someone. I'd like somebody to earn the job.''
</P>
<P>
   But expect Brown to get the greatest number of carries early in
the game at Tampa Bay, even as Barber continues to get his chance
to show the spark that made him so valuable last season.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Fassel heaped praise on Danny Kanell, who made a
number of high-quality throws downfield and showed great poise in
the pocket. Kanell _ like all Giants quarterbacks in the past seven
seasons _ loves to throw to the underrated Chris Calloway, and
Kanell is obviously beginning to develop a rapport with Ike
Hilliard.
</P>
<P>
   Hilliard and Calloway have split 40 receptions, and they work
well in combination with Amani Toomer, who had a big third-down
catch late in the third quarter as the Giants were holding off a
San Diego rally. A little more unclear is why 6-foot-5-inch rookie
wide receiver Joe Jurevicius, who was to be a key to the passing
attack especially near the goal line, has hardly played except on
special teams.

IN DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, ISOLATED AREAS GET FOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (See related HURRICANE-GEORGES)  
 (af)  
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER and RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic _ A small plane chartered by
the United States began dropping parcels of food and water Monday
to beleaguered people in villages and small towns that have been
isolated for nearly a week by flood waters and broken bridges
resulting from the hurricane that struck on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday afternoon the twin-engine turbo-prop plane swooped
low over a village mired in mud and swampy water about 100 miles
northwest of the capital. Hundreds of people frantically waved
their arms, yelled and scrambled to retrieve the parcels of bread,
cheese, chocolate and water. Some ripped open plastic wrappings and
began ravenously tearing into the bread and cheese.
</P>
<P>
   ``These bags don't contain so much, but it's gold when you
haven't eaten for four or five days,'' said Franklin Polanco, a
spokesman for the U.S. Embassy here.
</P>
<P>
   Working in a stifling hot airplane hangar, more than a dozen
Peace Corps volunteers stuffed thousands of bags with food
throughout the afternoon, breaking periodically to load them into
the empty cabin of a small, twin-engine turbo-prop jet as it
returned from each airdrop.
</P>
<P>
   In one flight to a village of 15,000 people that has been cut
off by flood waters for five days, Hurricane Georges' devastation
could be seen for miles. Cattle and horses wandered aimlessly, the
rivers were choked with mud. The tin roofs of houses had been
ripped off and scattered about, trees and crops were flattened.
</P>
<P>
   As the plane approached, villagers rushed it, sprinting across
muddy fields, trampling through a river and, in a few cases, racing
on horseback. Even after the plane dumped its load and began
ascending, people chased it, waving their arms and shouting.
</P>
<P>
   Dominican and U.S. officials estimated that as many as several
hundred thousand people may have been cut off from the rest of the
country by the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   With only four small helicopters _ and those not always in good
operating order _ the government of President Leonel Fernandez has
been able to get relief supplies to only a small portion of those
in need.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tragedy beyond our strength,'' said Adriano Tejada,
the chief spokesman for Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, government military trucks began delivering
food, water, small electric generators and tin roofing materials in
the capital and other areas where the roads were not cut. Two U.S.
Army Black Hawk helicopters arrived Monday morning to help out and
four more are expected Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As an initial response, the United Nations has provided 700 tons
of food and hundreds of cisterns for drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   One U.S. official said the administration was close to agreement
on providing about $20 million in aid to the Dominican Republic,
more than twice the $9.2 million that had previously been allocated
for all of 1998. Another $15 million, the official said, is likely
to go to other hard-hit Caribbean islands.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Dominican officials estimate the cost of reconstruction
here at about $3 billion. The next most severely hit island, Puerto
Rico, is expected to cost $2 billion to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   The government said two more bodies of people killed by the
hurricane were found Monday, bringing the total dead to 203. Some
government officials said they did not expect the losses to rise
much higher, but Adm. Ruben Paulino Alvarez, the chief of the
Dominican armed forces, said 75 people were still unaccounted for.
``We don't have much confidence'' that they will be found alive, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The airdrops Monday were organized by Natalie Woodward, the head
of the 150-man U.S. Peace Corps contingent in the Dominican
Republic. Ms. Woodward chartered a small, propeller-driven plane
with civilian pilots with money provided by American aid.
</P>
<P>
   Peace Corps volunteers spent most of Sunday night wrapping the
food in two-pound packages, which they dropped like small, friendly
bombs Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Not sure that the food parcels would survive the fall of 300 to
400 feet, some of the volunteers staged a test drop Sunday night
from the tallest building in Santo Domingo, a 24-story apartment
house. Three out of four parcels were still in good condition after
taking the nearly 250-foot plunge so, said Michael Stanton, an
American Embassy spokesman, the Peace Corps workers ``decided it
was worth doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The small plane, usually used to carry tourists and businessmen
around the country, made four flights Monday, dropping about 2,500
food parcels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a small step,'' said Stanton, ``but it's a start.''

   AMP BUYING SHARES TO STOP TAKEOVER BY ALLIED SIGNAL
</P>
<P>
   AMP announced a plan to buy back as much as 30 million shares of
stock for $55 each. The action met with mixed reviews from
analysts, and shares of AMP fell $2.1875, to $37.
</P>
<P>
   The buyback is intended to counter a hostile takeover bid of
$9.7 billion, or $44.50 a share, from Allied Signal. By offering
some stockholders a higher price for their shares, AMP, the maker
of electrical connectors, is seeking to appease investors and gain

REPORT ON EFFORT TO AID POOR FATHERS OFFERS DISCOURAGING NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla., Mass., Mich., N.J., Ohio, Tenn.) (sw) 
 By JASON DePARLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the age of limited benefits descends on welfare
families, policymakers have shown a keen new interest in absent
fathers, especially the undereducated, underemployed, often
streetwise men, who go months, if not years, without seeing their
children.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by a recent infusion of government and foundation money,
dozens of programs have sprung up to raise the earnings of these
fathers and increase the amount of child support they pay.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers released a long-awaited study on Monday of the
program for fathers that bore the hopes of a previous round of
reform and it mostly adds to the literature of disappointment that
surrounds initiatives for poor minority men.
</P>
<P>
   The program Parents' Fair Share failed to increase the earnings
or employment of noncustodial fathers it served. It did show a
small increase in the average amount of child support the fathers
paid _ about $4.20 a month, an increase of 6 percent. But even that
finding came with a footnote, because it failed a test of
statistical significance.
</P>
<P>
   The program tried to increase the fathers' earnings and their
child support payments and strengthen their family ties. Most of
the fathers in the program, which offered a mix of training and
counseling services, were black or Hispanic men and had not
finished high school. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The study was conducted by the Manpower Demonstration Research
Corp., a nonprofit organization based in New York City. The
report's general conclusions had long circulated among
policymakers, and the lessons have already been sharply debated
among the warring camps shaping a new generation of programs for
low-income fathers.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview on Monday, Fred Doolittle, a vice
president of the research corporation, said that not all of the
findings were discouraging. While the increase in child support
payments was small, he said, ``many people didn't expect any child
support increase.''
</P>
<P>
   Doolittle also cited anecdotal evidence that counseling sessions
with ``peer support groups'' led fathers to become more involved
with their children. ``That was a very encouraging surprise,'' he
said. Many of the new programs emphasize these peer support groups.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even supporters of fatherhood programs concede their work
remains cut out for them. ``It's disappointing that we didn't see
these guys running to the employment offices,'' said Rep. E. Clay
Shaw Jr., R-Fla., who is promoting a bill that would spend $2
billion on new programs for poor fathers. Shaw would direct the
money toward programs with a greater emphasis on marriage and give
some of it to religious groups, hoping ``they can get through to
some of these harder cases that the bureaucrats fail at.''
</P>
<P>
   Operating from 1994 to 1997 with government and foundation
money, Parents' Fair Share grew out of a 1988 welfare law. It tried
to build better relationships between child support agencies and
poor fathers whose children were often on welfare. It operated in
seven cities: Dayton, Ohio; Grand Rapids, Mich.; Jacksonville,
Fla.; Los Angeles; Memphis; Springfield, Mass., and Trenton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for their cooperation, the program promised fathers
training and counseling services, with three explicit goals: to
raise the fathers' earnings, increase child support payments and
strengthen their interaction with their children.
</P>
<P>
   But the study notes that the program typically suffered from a
cumbersome administration, split between child support agencies
that stressed collection and nonprofit groups that stressed
services. In some places, there was a shortage of training programs
that would admit the fathers.
</P>
<P>
   In the program, almost half of the men had failed to graduate
from high school and nearly 70 percent had criminal records. About
80 percent of the fathers referred to the program by local child
support agencies were black or Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   The program's effect on child support came in two ways. First,
just by forcing child support agencies to review cases they
typically ignored, it identified some fathers able to pay, perhaps
through previously unreported jobs. The extra case reviews raised
the average child support payment by 19 percent, to a monthly
average of $61.
</P>
<P>
   The second effect was found among the fathers actually referred
to the program. Their payments increased an average of 6 percent to
a monthly total of about $75. The increases were most pronounced in
Dayton, Ohio, where payments rose 55 percent, to $60 a month, and
in Grand Rapids, Mich., where they rose 20 percent to $91 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The payment amount actually fell in Memphis; Trenton, N.J., and
Springfield, Mass., though the declines were not statistically
significant. Overall, the percentage of fathers who made any
payment in an 18-month period rose to 73 percent from 69 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons for the future?
</P>
<P>
   Wendell Primus, an analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities, a nonprofit research group, wants more and better
services. ``There were some sites that did better, and that gives
me some cause for optimism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But some conservatives said the results underscore the limits of
traditional social services. ``The promotion of marriage is the
ideal,'' said Wade Horn, president of the National Fatherhood
Initiative, a nonprofit group that promotes responsible fatherhood.
He acknowledged that the ``restoration of marriage'' might also be
difficult to achieve.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The rabbi doesn't look like a political football.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 years old, he has a fuzzy white beard that sweeps
his chest. He emits great guttural mumbles when he speaks, which is
rarely. He wears a fixed smile and a dreamy gaze, which some take
to be faith and others to be senility.
</P>
<P>
   But for more than a week now, Rabbi Yitzhak Kadouri has been
tossed among Israel's leaders in a spirited public debate about the
boundaries between religion and politics, rationalism and
mysticism, and the past and the future in the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   He has been caught in an unholy war of words that illustrates,
among other things, that this Iraqi-born mystic has come to play a
bizarrely important role in this country's political life.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1990s, Kadouri has been flown around by
helicopter to raise robed arms and deliver blessings at the festive
political rallies put on by Shas, a religious party that represents
Sephardic Jews and has grown to be the third-largest political
party in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   With each event, his popularity has increased and spread beyond
Shas. He developed a client list including leftists and retired
intelligence officials. The day before Benjamin Netanyahu was
elected prime minister, he bowed his head beneath the rabbi's
hands. And then there were Kadouri blessing cards, amulets and even
a highway safety kit that was sold at gas stations.
</P>
<P>
   About a week and a half ago, though, David Levy, Netanyahu's
former foreign minister, who is Sephardic, issued a public
declamation of Kadouri fever.
</P>
<P>
   That forced a host of other politicians, commentators and rabbis
to sally forth into a turbulent discussion of whither Israel: back
to the days of the dybbuks _ the demons of Jewish folklore _ or
onward toward a secular, democratic, high-tech state?
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on a popular Israeli radio program, Levy broke a taboo
subject by questioning the rabbi's lucidity and complaining about
his exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Rabbi Kadouri,'' he said, ``with all due respect, I'm not
sure if he even knows where he is living, the poor guy. He is being
abused. Does he know whom he is blessing? Does he know what
neighborhood he is being taken to? The use being made of him takes
us back to the dark ages, with people looking for good-luck charms
and attributing divine qualities to a human being.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hue and cry that followed, some said Levy, whose
constituency Shas has been stealing, was driven by personal peeve.
On a recent helicopter trip to Levy's hometown, it turned out,
Kadouri had blessed the candidate opposing Levy's son for mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many praised Levy for speaking out, for exposing a raw
nerve in Israeli society. Judging by the reaction, there is a
growing discomfort among many Israelis, secular and traditionally
observant, with the spread of folk Judaism _ particularly the
veneration of aged rabbis and, later, the pilgrimages to their
graves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Levy did what no one dared to do because of Kadouri's
political weight,'' said Daniel Ben-Simon, a keen observer of
Israeli society for the newspaper Haaretz. ``He said the emperor
has no clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Sephardic chief rabbi was moved to speak out against
the ``exaggerated and improper use of rabbis in politics,'' and its
Ashkenazic chief rabbi denounced all rabbinical involvement.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Netanyahu invited Kadouri to issue him a blessing
for the Jewish New Year. Ehud Barak, the Labor Party leader, made a
New Year's resolution to no longer seek rabbinical endorsements,
and Netanyahu then derided Barak for taking a position only because
he could not get any blessings anyway.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the poor, religious neighborhood of Jerusalem where Kadouri
holds court, a steady stream of believers knocked on the door of
his rundown home. There were traffic police officers, pregnant
women and tourists from Brooklyn, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very holy guy,'' said Ilana Cohen of New York, who
stopped by during a trip here. ``If he blesses, you know it
works.''
</P>
<P>
   Kadouri is surrounded by a coterie of grandchildren and aides,
who negotiate his appearances. They refused to let him be
interviewed, although they did volunteer that he would be available
to bless President Clinton during his current crisis.
</P>
<P>
   They offered only a sketchy biography. The rabbi, they said, was
born in Iraq and moved at age 16 to Jerusalem, where he showed an
interest in kabala, or Jewish mystical studies, as a teen-ager.
Seventy years ago, they said, he started handing out blessings,
which often worked miracles.
</P>
<P>
   Since Levy spoke out, Kadouri's credentials as a rabbi and a
kabalist have been challenged. Another kabalist rabbi, Yisrael
Abu-hatzera, known as Baba Baruch, said Kadouri had ``no lineage''
and had been ``made up from scratch.'' But there is no question
that he is considered a holy man by thousands, even if he has
published no scholarly texts on mystical theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have long been holy men at the fringes of political life
here,'' said Yoram Bilu, an anthropologist at Hebrew University.
``What's different with Kadouri is that he's not at the periphery
but at the center _ because of Shas, which did not exist before.''
</P>
<P>
   Shas officials say that they have always had a relationship with
Kadouri, but that the relationship intensified in the early 1990s,
when they began giving away good-luck charms, water bottles and
amulets blessed by him. In exchange the recipients had to give Shas
their names and addresses, which were fed into the party's
database.
</P>
<P>
   In a scathing column for Haaretz last week, Ran Kislev named
Kadouri as Man of the Year, symbol of ``the rise of ignorance.'' He
referred to the ``embarrassing display of the prime minister
receiving a blessing from an ancient figure who, according to the
testimony of many, is not entirely all there.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night the rabbi's chauffeured Volvo inched through
an excited crowd to the steps of a synagogue in Bnei Brak, outside
Tel Aviv. In the front seat, Kadouri floated inside his robes,
almost evanescent beneath his tarboosh hat. An announcer with a
microphone warned his followers not to touch the rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very fragile,'' the announcer said. ``Very lucid,
contrary to the slander we have heard this week, but very
fragile.''

GOP REJECTS $3.5 BILLION ADDITIONAL AID TO FARMERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, Miss., Alaska)   (af)  
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Setting up a confrontation with President Clinton,
congressional Republicans Monday night rejected a Democratic
request for $3.5 billion in additional emergency aid to farmers.
But they approved millions of dollars for individual agricultural
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Congress had already agreed to provide $4 billion in emergency
farm aid for the next fiscal year. But Clinton recently joined
Democrats in Congress, led by Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, in seeking
$7.5 billion in response to emergencies like droughts, floods,
disease and the disappearance of foreign markets, all of which have
forced crop prices down and created what Democrats say is a crisis
on the nation's farms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a terrible emergency out there, and we have to address
it, and $4 billion is just woefully inadequate,'' Harkin said
Monday night as House and Senate negotiators thrashed out their
different versions of the agriculture spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans said they could not spend the additional $3.5
billion without making cuts elsewhere in the federal budget. They
said the Democrats' move would be an irresponsible busting of a
budget agreement and was an obvious political ploy, coming five
weeks before the congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an interesting exercise in political posturing,'' said
Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., who said the administration was
suffering from a ``breakdown in leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as House and Senate negotiators rejected the additional
farm relief, they quickly added $77 million in special interest
projects sought by individual members. Most of that money, $50
million, had been requested by Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, who is
chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, to bolster the
salmon industry. The other $27 million was added for items like
subsidies for mohair, honey and apple growers.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has threatened to veto the entire agriculture
spending bill if it does not include the extra relief money, part
of which would pay for lifting a freeze on marketing loan rates.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is also unhappy with a Republican-backed
measure attached to the bill that would bar the Food and Drug
Administration from approving drugs that induce abortions, like the
French abortion pill RU-486.

DEMOCRATIC HOPEFULS CALL FOR LOTTERIES IN S.C., ALA. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)  (mk) 
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A red-bearded Bubba, outfitted in a baseball cap and a
Georgia Bulldogs T-shirt, grins devilishly from behind the counter
of his convenience store and explains to South Carolina voters why
it is that ``here in Georgia, we looooove David Beasley.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Georgia lottery tickets y'all buy pay for computers in
every one of our classrooms,'' the man explains in a new television
advertisement produced by the South Carolina Democratic Party.
``Thank goodness your governor, David Beasley, won't let y'all have
a lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   Across Georgia's western border, meanwhile, Democratic campaign
advertisements in Alabama are also extolling Georgia's lottery.
``Since 1993, Georgia's lottery has sent 300,000 high school
graduates to college,'' says the narrator in an advertisement for
Don Siegelman, Alabama's Democratic nominee for governor. ``Don
Siegelman is fighting for a lottery right here in Alabama.''
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom in the South has been that conservative
states like Alabama and South Carolina are solidly Republican and
that there is little Democrats can do to win back the governorships
they lost in the 1980s. But this year, both Siegelman and Jim
Hodges, the Democratic candidate for governor in South Carolina,
are mounting aggressive challenges to Republican incumbents,
largely on the strength of their support for Georgia-style
lotteries that would produce millions of dollars for education.
</P>
<P>
   The lottery has become something of a magic bullet for Democrats
in the fiscally conservative South because it provides an
acceptable means of addressing a gnawing political concern _
underachieving educational systems _ without raising taxes. And
because Republican candidates are loath to alienate their base of
religious conservative voters, who tend to oppose the lottery on
moral grounds, they typically are forced to take a contrary
position.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that education is the leading concern of voters in
many states this year, including Alabama and South Carolina. In the
most recent comparison of national standardized test scores,
Alabama fourth-graders ranked 48th in math proficiency and 40th in
reading proficiency, while South Carolina fourth- graders ranked
47th in math and 46th in reading.
</P>
<P>
   Polls also show that more than two-thirds of Alabamians and
South Carolinians would support a lottery whose revenue would be
dedicated to education, as is the case in 15 of the 37 states with
lotteries.
</P>
<P>
   And Hodges and Siegelman seem to have benefited by making
lotteries the centerpieces of their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Siegelman, the lieutenant governor of Alabama, has a slim lead
in polls and a significant advantage in fund-raising over Gov. Fob
James Jr., a Republican who opposes the lottery on both moral and
fiscal grounds. In South Carolina, campaign aides to Beasley, the
Republican incumbent, and to Hodges, a former legislative leader,
said that internal polling suggested that their race had tightened
considerably in recent weeks and was now considered
``competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Democratic campaigns have used Georgia's lottery, which
sold its first tickets in 1993, as a model.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates are aware that the college scholarships and
pre-kindergarten programs that the popular lottery has financed
have helped make its Democratic architect, Gov. Zell Miller,
immensely popular as well.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's lottery, by most accounts, has been well managed. And
Siegelman and Hodges regularly note that thousands of Alabamians
and South Carolinians cross the Georgia line each year to buy
lottery tickets, contributing their dollars to improve Georgia's
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``My response when Fob James says that we don't need a lottery
is that we've already got a lottery,'' Siegelman said in an
interview. ``I'm not introducing a new concept here. I'm just
saying we need to keep those hundreds of millions of dollars that
are leaving Alabama.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Miller, then Georgia's lieutenant governor, ran his
campaign for governor largely as a referendum on an education
lottery. The strategy was considered risky because of Georgia's
sizable population of religious conservatives, particularly
Southern Baptists.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller won the election by 8 percentage points, pushed a
lottery bill through the General Assembly, and then spearheaded a
referendum campaign that resulted in a 52 percent to 48 percent
victory for the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, lottery revenues have provided $580
million in so-called HOPE scholarships to 319,000 Georgia college
students, without regard to family income. They also have placed
more than 246,000 4-year-olds through voluntary, tuition-free
pre-kindergarten programs. And $1.1 billion has been spent to
provide computers and other capital improvements for Georgia
schools.
</P>
<P>
   A poll taken last spring for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution
showed that 75 percent of those Georgians questioned, including
nearly two-thirds who said they were weekly churchgoers, said they
thought the state should keep the lottery. And as Miller prepares
to leave office after two terms, his job approval ratings have
approached 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Siegelman, who has hired several former Miller aides for his
campaign, has proposed a lottery plan that is virtually identical
to Georgia's. Lottery receipts, he says, would provide $150 million
a year for pre-kindergarten programs, classroom computers and
college scholarships for students with a B average or better,
regardless of need.
</P>
<P>
   Siegelman's campaign has broadcast three separate television
commercials about his education proposals. He said he sensed quiet
support for the lottery even among conservative Christians.
``Southern Baptists have children and they want the best for their
kids,'' Siegelman said. ``Folks come up to me in the grocery store
and whisper in my ear, `Hey, I'm for this lottery, too.'''
</P>
<P>
   James said earlier this month that he was considering a proposal
to provide college scholarships to the financially needy, paid for
with existing revenues. His aides did not return telephone calls
requesting comment on Siegelman's plan.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In South Carolina, Hodges and the state Democratic Party have
filled the airwaves with advertising about his lottery proposal,
which he estimates would produce at least $150 million a year for
college scholarships, pre-kindergarten classes, reductions in class
size and other initiatives. It did not hurt his cause earlier this
month that South Carolina students once again ranked last in the
country on the SAT college entrance exam.

<P>
   ``I think the lottery is compelling because people in South
Carolina recognize that we need to make significant improvements in
our schools and the lottery is a way of achieving that without
raising our taxes,'' said Hodges, who opposed the lottery until he
began his campaign for governor. ``South Carolinians are a
conservative bunch, and they see a lottery as a voluntary tax that
you only pay if you play.''
</P>
<P>
   Beasley has responded by reminding voters of a less ambitious
college scholarship program that he supported this year, and of a
recent expansion of the state's kindergarten program, which he
originally dismissed as unnecessary but ultimately approved. The
governor and his aides also have tried to change the subject by
criticizing Hodges' heavy financial support from South Carolina's
video poker industry.
</P>
<P>
   And Monday, in an open acknowledgment that Hodges's advocacy for
the lottery was drowning out all other campaign issues, Beasley
held a news conference in Columbia to announce that he was shifting
positions and would no longer oppose a referendum on the lottery.
Although he said he still did not favor a lottery, the governor
said he hoped his new stand would move the lottery debate aside so
that voters could focus on the role played by gambling interests in
the Hodges campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am doing this,'' Beasley said, ``because the 1998 election
must not become a referendum on the lottery.''

 &HT;    Misunderstanding clouds Everglades, Kissimmee River restoration
bill
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Not even Newt Gingrich could help Monday
night, as Florida lost out on $27 million needed to help the
Everglades and begin restoring the Kissimmee River.
</P>
<P>
   Some key congressmen are blaming the agency that asked for the
money: the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. They say a mid-level corps
official told Congress at the last minute that the agency doesn't
need the money, according to U.S. Rep. Mark Foley and environmental
lobbyists, who heard the reports second-hand.
</P>
<P>
   A top corps administrator adamantly denied it Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the House voted 389-25 for a $21 billion energy and
water bill. It gives the corps $14 million less than it says it
needs for first major fix of the Kissimmee.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists call the project crucial to restoring Lake Okeechobee
and the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   The corps also fell $13 million short for a host of other
environmental projects in South and Central Florida. Those projects
could include restoration of Loxahatchee Slough or creation of a
pollution-filtering reservoir on 10-Mile Creek in St. Lucie County.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Gingrich recently wrote a letter endorsing the
corps' Kissimmee request, which earlier had fallen victim to a spat
between the White House and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Foley and National Audubon Society lobbyist Tom Adams said they
hope to recover the money later this year, when Congress piles most
of the rest of the federal budget into a single bill.
</P>
<P>
   But they had no hope of fixing Monday's bill, which now goes to
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable,'' Adams said. ``It's rare enough to get
that kind of letter from the speaker. Then to have it ignored, it
boggles my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley, R-West Palm Beach, said he wants to know if anyone from
the corps undermined the request. He voted for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   He said Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., a member of the House-Senate
conference committee that crafted the final spending numbers,
reported getting such a statement from a corps official. Reid could
not be reached for comment late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wouldn't make that up,'' Foley said. ``There's no reason
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Davis, deputy assistant secretary of the Army, insisted
that nobody at the corps made such a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't come from the corps,'' he said. In a letter last
week, he wrote that either the reported remark never occurred or
``a comment from the Corps was misinterpreted.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams said he's sure some communication mixup occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause, Davis said the corps won't be able to begin
the first major step in the Kissimmee repair, the filling of nine
miles of canal.
</P>
<P>
   The project is part of a long-running effort to undo the damage
the corps did 30 years ago, when it straightened the curving river
into a stagnant canal.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration asked for $27 million to start the
work, and Davis said the corps needs at least $22 million to do any
of it. The bill the House passed Monday provides $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also had sought $20 million for the other
environmental projects. The bill provides $7 million. It's unclear
what specific projects will suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said it's highly unlikely that the Senate will reopen the
bill at this late stage. He said President Clinton also would have
little leverage to demand changes, since both earlier versions of
the bill passed by veto-proof majorities.

 &HT;    Rabbi's words fit Clinton situation
 &HT;    By Marcus Franklin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Rabbi Jack Riemer understands President Clinton's
public plea of penitence.
</P>
<P>
   Riemer, formerly of Dayton, wrote the 204-word passage about
repentance and changing one's ways Clinton read Sept. 12 at a
national prayer breakfast attended by 106 clergy members.
</P>
<P>
   Riemer wrote Now Is The Time For Turning while serving as rabbi
at Beth Abraham synagogue in Dayton from 1964 to 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prayer is about how important it is for people to face up
to their mistakes and be willing to change even if it's
embarrassing and painful,'' Riemer said
</P>
<P>
   Riemer, now of Boca Raton, Fla., said he was moved and flattered
but surprised as he watched a live CNN broadcast of the president
reading the text. Hours later, the Starr report publicly detailed
Clinton's illicit relationship with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly wasn't thinking of him when I wrote it but it fits
his situation,'' Riemer said from his home Monday. ``The temptation
to cover up and deny is so great in all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   And as Jews around the world observe Yom Kippur, the holy day of
atonement, at sundown tonight, Riemer said the country is focusing
far too much on the misdeeds of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cop-out from dealing with our own sins,'' he said.
``Yom Kippur is about looking into the mirror and examining our own
lives. If we get caught up in what they're doing in Washington,
it's a projection away from our own sins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether his apology is sincere or not, that's God's
department.''
</P>
<P>
   During his delivery, Clinton honed in on the Jewish steps for
repentance; acknowledge wrongdoing, apologize to those you have
wronged and take steps to make sure you do not repeat the
transgression.
</P>
<P>
   Riemer said he wrote On Turning and other prayers because
``Judaism has to speak to the issues and the language of our
time.''
</P>
<P>
   It reads, in part, ``For leaves, birds and animals, turning
comes instinctively. But for us, turning does not come so easily..
. . It means breaking old habits. It means admitting that we have
been wrong; and this is never easy. It means losing face; it means
starting all over again; and this is always painful. It means
saying: I am sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   The prayer is contained in the Gates of Repentance, the Jewish
Reform movement's High Holy Days prayer book.
</P>
<P>
   More than 700,000 copies of Gates of Repentance are used in
about 90 percent of Reform congregations in the United States,
Reform Jewish officials estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Riemer said his prayers have also been set to music and
performed at Lincoln Center in New York.

HOW TO VIEW E-MAIL AT WORK USING HOTMAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID EINSTEIN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 Q:  I signed up for free e-mail with Hotmail. I've been told I can
use it to access messages from my account at work. How do I do
that?
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Hotmail, as well as most other free e-mail services, can be
used to access mail from any account that uses the POP3 protocol.
This includes almost all ISP accounts and most corporate accounts.
The only problem would be if your company has thrown up a fire wall
to prevent outside access.
</P>
<P>
   To configure Hotmail to get your POP mail, you'll need a little
information from your systems people at work: the name of the
incoming mail server (also known as the POP server), the ID you use
to access your mail at work, and the password. One other thing:
Hotmail has an option box labeled ``Leave messages on POP server.''
If you want to be able to view messages from your computer at work
after you've read them using Hotmail, select it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; According to my computer, I connect to the Internet at
115,200 bps. Because I have a 56K modem, I know that can't be so.
What's causing the Dial-Up Networking feature to give me the wrong
information, and how can I tell my actual connect speed?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; The 115,200 represents the speed at which the modem is
talking to the computer. It has nothing to do with the phone
connection. The most likely explanation is that you've got the
wrong modem driver installed. (A driver is a software file that
controls how the computer works with a peripheral, such as a
modem.) It could be one designed for the brand of modem you have
but not the exact model. Or it could be a generic driver that
happens to work with your modem.
</P>
<P>
   In your situation, it's hard to determine the true connection
speed. You could change drivers and see if that solves the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Go to the modem icon in the Windows Control Panel to find out
which driver you're using, and if it isn't the one for your modem,
try reinstalling the modem using the driver that came with it. If
you don't have that software, go to the Web site of the company
that made the modem _ or the PC if the modem came with the system _
and you should be able to find a driver there.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of modem speeds, a bunch of readers wrote saying they
went to the 3Com Web site but couldn't find the feature I mentioned
that lets you check whether your phone line can handle 56K speeds.
So here's the exact address: www.3com.com/56k/
need456k/linetest.html.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; A while ago, you gave directions for getting rid of the URL
trail in the Address bar of Internet Explorer. Can you tell me how
to do the same thing in Netscape Navigator? I don't want others to
know where I've been going on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Just to refresh everyone's memory, if you click the arrow
to the right of the address space in your browser, you'll see a
list of URLs that you've entered in order to visit Web sites. In
Microsoft Internet Explorer, deleting the list is simply a matter
of clearing the History. (The history is the entire record of where
you've gone on the Web, including all the places you've visited by
clicking your mouse on a hyperlink.)
</P>
<P>
   In Netscape Navigator, clearing the history doesn't empty the
address list (which Netscape calls the Location list). If you want
to remove the addresses, you'll have to do it manually. Here's how:
</P>
<P>
   _ Open the prefs.js file in your user folder inside Netscape.
You can do this in a couple of ways. My favorite is to use Windows
Explorer and click through the directory tree, going to Program
Files, then Netscape, then Users, then finally your own user
folder. Double-click the prefs.js file, and when you're asked which
program to use in opening it, choose Notepad _ a simple
text-editing tool that doesn't add unnecessary formatting.
</P>
<P>
   _ Right near the top of the file, you'll find the list of
Internet addresses. In fact, they should be numbered URL1, URL2,
and so forth. Go ahead and delete all the lines that include
addresses, being careful not to erase anything else.
</P>
<P>
   _ Save the prefs.js file and get out of there.
</P>
<P>
   TIP OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   Want to follow the playoffs on your computer? Several Web sites
provide pitch-by-pitch coverage of Major League Baseball, along
with continually updated box scores. Two of the best are ESPN's
SportsZone (www.espn.com) and CBS SportsLine (www.sportsline.com).
Another good option is Stats Inc. on AOL (keyword stats).

COOLMAIL LETS YOU GET YOUR E-MAIL BY PHONE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID EINSTEIN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
One of the biggest disadvantages of e-mail has been that you need a
computer to receive it. But not anymore. Now, a small Illinois
company is offering a free service that lets you hear your e-mail
messages over the phone.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In most ways, CoolMail, from Planetary Motion, is just like
other Web-based e-mail services. You get a free account with which
you can send and receive messages via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And like services from Yahoo, Excite, Netscape and others,
CoolMail can access almost any ISP or corporate e-mail system,
letting you get your work messages without having to connect to
your company's computer.
</P>
<P>
   What sets CoolMail apart is its ability to read mail aloud over
the phone, through use of an automated speech synthesizer.
</P>
<P>
   After setting up your account online (at
www.planetarymotion.com), you just dial into the company's system
(there are access numbers for 15 U.S. cities) and treat your e-mail
as if it were voice mail. You can hear just the name of the sender
and subject of each message, or listen to an entire message.
</P>
<P>
   There are several ways to send a reply to a message over the
phone:
</P>
<P>
   _ Use a predefined response that you compose on the CoolMail Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   _ Send an audio file (free to another CoolMail member, 10 cents
to anyone else).
</P>
<P>
   _ Dictate an e-mail message for 2 cents per word.
</P>
<P>
   Planetary Motion is developing several new service options that
_ for a monthly fee _ will let users compose original e-mail
messages over the phone, forward mail and get notification of
incoming messages over a cell phone or pager.
</P>
<P>
   CoolMail could be just the ticket for travelers who dread
lugging around a laptop and going through the rigamarole of
connecting to the Internet in their hotel room just to check their
e-mail. It's also useful for anyone who feels the need to keep
current on e-mail while in the car or on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   The service isn't without its drawbacks. The computer-generated
voice that reads to you could get annoying if you have to listen to
it plod through a lot of messages. And Planetary Motion's phone
system isn't perfect. One day last week, the local access numbers
went down, possibly as a result of too much traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Sandi Schleicher, development manager for Planetary Motion of
Glencoe, Ill., acknowledged that the company has experienced some
system problems in its quest to accommodate more than 100,000 users
since the system went up in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``But things have stabilized over the past month, and we're
very, very pleased with the way the system is now,'' Schleicher
said.

FEUD AT TOP IS DISRUPTING MUTUAL FUND; YACKTMAN FIGHTING BOARD  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A fight for control of a formerly highly regarded
mutual fund is brewing between its manager and independent
directors. If the battle follows the pattern of several similar
recent battles, shareholders could be the biggest losers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Donald Yacktman, manager of two mutual funds that
bear his name and have total assets of $575 million, asked
shareholders to vote out four of the six directors, saying they had
pressed him to change his investment style.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Yacktman is asking shareholders to elect three new
directors supported by him at a meeting Nov. 24. If shareholders do
not, Yacktman has threatened to resign as portfolio manager.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the independent directors voted to remove Yacktman
as president of the funds, although his firm, Yacktman Asset
Management, remains under contract as portfolio manager. The
directors also released a letter they had sent to Arthur Levitt,
chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, outlining
complaints they had made to Yacktman over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   The directors wrote Levitt that they were concerned about an
apparent change in the manager's investment technique; his use of
derivatives; a possible employee violation of the funds' ethics
code, and management of the funds by individuals not identified in
the prospectus.
</P>
<P>
   The degree of adversity and distrust between Yacktman and the
outside directors is apparent in the June dismissal of Jon Carlson,
formerly an executive vice president of Yacktman Asset Management.
Carlson, who has remained a director, is now siding with the three
other outside directors against his former employer.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute resembles a confrontation last year between Louis
Navellier, a portfolio manager, and the independent directors of a
fund he managed. The independent directors dismissed Navellier as
portfolio manager but failed to get enough shareholder support to
award the fund's management contract to the company they favored.
After losing a shareholder vote, the independent directors
resigned, Navellier returned as portfolio manager and shareholders
elected a board of his choosing.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who stayed with the Navellier fund through the turmoil
were the ultimate losers, however, as many of their fellow
investors withdrew their money and the fund's performance fell as
the interim manager sold many stocks from the portfolio at
depressed prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Yacktman Fund, the larger of the two funds managed by
Yacktman, has similarly seen assets flood out, dropping from $1.1
billion last Dec. 31 to $541 million on Aug. 31. The decline has
come as the fund's performance has lagged behind that of the market
and of its peers.
</P>
<P>
   Through Friday, the fund was down 12.3 percent this year; it has
lost 13.5 percent over the last 12 months. That compares with
gains, including reinvested dividends, of 8.8 percent this year and
13.1 percent in the last 12 months for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index. A second fund, the Yacktman Focused fund, has similarly
lagged behind its peers.
</P>
<P>
   Over much longer periods, however, Yacktman has performed
strongly. He was named portfolio manager of the year in 1991 by
Morningstar Inc., the Chicago fund-tracking company, for his
management of the Selected American Shares fund. He started the
Yacktman Fund in 1992 and the Focused fund last year.

ONLINE REPORT CARDS MEAN NO MORE SCHOOL DAZE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMIE BECKETT  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Report cards and grades let parents measure how well their child is
doing in school. But until recently, finding out how well the
school itself was doing was a whole lot harder.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now four Web sites make it a cinch to dig up data on a variety
of schools _ in the Bay Area, California and nationwide _ by
allowing parents to quickly get such information as the latest test
scores, class sizes, teacher credentials, school enrollment,
advanced placement and ratios, such as the number of students per
computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information was there, but it was harder to get,'' said
John Kotko, a Redwood Shores father whose daughter is in first
grade. ``You'd have to rely on word of mouth or talking to school
district officials, who are only going to say good things about
their schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Kotko said the Web lets him do more than simply retrieve data on
his daughter's school; it helps him determine which are the best
schools and what makes them that way.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, parents seeking detailed school data faced the
laborious task of contacting each school or district individually,
often running into resistance from school officials, who tend to
shy away from comparisons, education experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The newest site, launched about two weeks ago, is
www.greatschools.net. Great Schools is a project of the nonprofit
Silicon Valley group Smart Valley Inc. that is paid for with
corporate and foundation funds. The new Web site offers complete
information on 100 schools in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties.
</P>
<P>
   Free school profiles include math and reading test scores,
average class size for each grade, school curriculum, teaching
philosophy, technology, enrichment programs, day care, safety and a
demographic breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   Besides statistics, the site has miniprofiles of school programs
and basic information about the California public school system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more good information people have about school quality and
character, the more effective they'll be in pushing for and
contributing to school improvement,'' said Bill Jackson, Great
Schools president.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of November, some 300 schools will be listed, and,
eventually, all 1,200 public schools in the Bay Area will be
profiled, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Another free site, www.ed-data.k12.ca.us, offers similar
information _ but for all California public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Typing in the name of the school and district produces a report
on school demographics, test scores, dropout rates (for high
schools), class sizes and teacher credentials. The site also lets
parents compare how California schools stack up to others in the
nation with rankings of class sizes, school spending per pupil and
other measures of school quality.
</P>
<P>
   Put together by a partnership of the Alameda County office of
education, the state Department of Education, a team from Kern
County's superintendent's office and the nonprofit
education-information group EdSource, the Web site can also serve
as a primer for parents on California's education spending,
evaluating test scores, teacher credentialing and numerous other
education topics.
</P>
<P>
   Education publisher School Wise Press launched its school
ranking site, www.schoolwisepress.com, in July to solve a problem.
The San Francisco firm found its guidebooks on school performance
became outdated too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year's test scores weren't what customers wanted. Every
time the data was revised, the books became less valuable to our
customers,'' said Steve Rees, School Wise editor and publisher.
</P>
<P>
   A parent himself, Rees started the business after he got
frustrated about his difficulties prying information from school
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site contains test scores and teacher experience for
California public schools, as well as figures for the percent of
children receiving free lunches, among other data. For $6, parents
can order a more detailed report with additional measurements of
school quality and comparisons of the school to others in the
county and state. Rees hopes to expand the site to include reports
on schools in other states.
</P>
<P>
   The site also has a catalog where parents can order education
magazines and School Wise books on parents' rights, dealing with
bad teachers, charter schools and other topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to be the Consumer Reports of school information
providers,'' Rees said.
</P>
<P>
   For those looking beyond California, www.schoolmatch.com boasts
information on every public and accredited private school in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Launched in 1995, the site is strictly a commercial service used
primarily by real estate agents and corporations. For $34 apiece,
School Match sells reports on individual districts. Besides
enrollment, class size, school spending, special education and test
scores, the reports allow users to compare the property values,
income and education levels of a school district with national
averages.
</P>
<P>
   For $68, customers get a personalized report that attempts to
match a family's preferences with various school systems. These may
include such factors as the existence of music or sports programs,
said a School Match spokesman.

GENERAL MOTORS REVS UP WEB SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID EINSTEIN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
The Internet is changing the way people buy books, flowers and
airline tickets. General Motors is convinced it also will
fundamentally alter the way it sells cars.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world's largest automaker said yesterday it plans a national
rollout of a Web site that lets consumers track down the exact
model car or truck they want, print out a window sticker, schedule
a test drive and get a commitment on a low purchase price from a
local dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers still must negotiate final terms, financing and
trade-in allowance in person. But GM hopes its new GM BuyPower
program will streamline the car-buying process _ an ordeal that
many consumers consider slightly less distasteful than root canal
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers in California, Washington, Oregon and Idaho have had
access to a pilot program at www.gmbuypower.com for almost a year.
An enhanced version of the site will be launched for all 50 states
in the first quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
   GM, the first major automaker to launch a Web initiative, will
be going up against several well-established sites that provide
consumers with car-buying information and dealer referrals. Among
the leaders in the young field are www.autobytel.com,
www.autovantage.com and www.carpoint.com.
</P>
<P>
   They're all fighting for a piece of what is shaping up to be a
huge market. A recent survey by J.D. Power and Associates found
that 25 percent of all new-car buyers use the Internet to arm
themselves with product and pricing information.
</P>
<P>
   No one is suggesting that people will buy cars directly over the
Web _ at least for the foreseeable future. ``In the short term, the
Internet is a tool for helping customers work within the
traditional shopping process, not circumvent it,'' said Chris
Denove, director of consulting operations for J.D. Power.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're still talking about a major purchase, where the
customer needs an extra measure of comfort you get by dealing with
a person,'' said analyst Richard Hilgert of First of Michigan in
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear, however, is that dealers are going to have to
change the way they sell cars to savvy shoppers who sometimes know
more about the cars they're buying than the salesmen do.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very aggressive effort to give dealers the tools to
meet the demands of customers in the Internet age,'' said Ann Noel
Blakney, director of GM's Consumer Marketing Initiative. ``We offer
dealers the ability to have a very sophisticated Web site and to be
able to communicate in a way that customers have asked for.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the marketing advantages the Internet offers, GM may
have a hard time selling GM BuyPower to its 8,000 dealers. Only 60
percent of GM dealers have signed on in the pilot states.
</P>
<P>
   The program has resulted in just 8,000 car sales so far,
prompting some dealers to call it a flop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten a few leads, a few sales, but people are
skeptical,'' said George Olsen, president of George Olsen
Cadillac-Oldsmobile in Burlingame. ``The surface perception is that
it's an easy way to buy a car. In actuality, it's not any easier
than going into the dealership.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Begier, general manager of Ben A. Begier Buick in San
Leandro, was more blunt. ``BuyPower has been a failure,'' he said.
``People still want to see, touch and feel a new car. GM is in
denial on the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Begier thinks GM intends to favor company-owned stores and
gradually edge out the privately owned dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   GM will have its hands full challenging market-leading
Autobytel.com, which has been one of the hottest Internet success
stories. The Irvine (Orange County) company said that this month
alone it will provide information leading to more than 28,700 car
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Lorimer, chief executive of Autobytel.com, said he's not
afraid of the challenge posed by GM's entry into the market.
``Anything that increases the awareness of car-buying on the
Internet is a good thing, and GM BuyPower will do that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lorimer, Autobytel.com provides more crucial
information to shoppers than GM does. For instance, GM offers
sticker prices, but Autobytel.com gives invoice prices _ what the
dealer actually paid for a car.

QUIETLY, FOUR ON JUDICIARY PANEL TRY TO STEER A CENTER COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They are an unlikely quartet, two House Republicans
and two House Democrats, who are waging a quiet campaign to take
the partisan sting out of the House impeachment deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   One is a former union lawyer in Los Angeles. Another was a
district attorney in the Boston area. One used to be an Air Force
lawyer. And the fourth was a U.S. attorney in Arkansas who
prosecuted President Clinton's brother, Roger, on drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   While their colleagues on the 37-member House Judiciary
Committee engage in hand-to-hand political combat, these four
veterans of legal battles in earlier careers have set aside their
rhetorical cudgels and are quietly trading ideas on how to insure
the deliberations are fair and on how to maintain credibility with
a public that increasingly wants the whole scandal to go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a group of members, four or five of us, that are
actually starting to have lunch or breakfast, and trying to talk
about how we can make sure that process goes forward and makes some
sense,'' Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The other core members of the group, who first met over
breakfast last Thursday and met again on Monday, are Rep. Asa
Hutchinson, R-Ark., and two Democrats, William Delahunt of
Massachusetts and Howard Berman of California. Other committee
members join in now and then.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, these four centrists are a distinct minority on one
of the most partisan committees in Congress. And aside from Berman,
an eight-term legislator, they are all low on the seniority ladder.
</P>
<P>
   But with public opinion polls reflecting skepticism that the
committee and the full House can carry out the solemn impeachment
process with clear-eyed dispassion, the lawmakers may yet have a
lasting influence on the proceedings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to exaggerate their importance, but there is a
little buzz about what they're doing,'' said one Democratic aide,
who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The four legislators have supported efforts for the full
committee to review about two dozen boxes of material that the
Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, did not send to the
House. On Monday, Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the panel chairman,
said the committee would do just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is something over there that helps the president in
the opinion of the other side, let's get it,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   The group also wants Starr to disclose what, if anything, his
inquiries into such matters as the White House travel office and
FBI files have produced, so the House can consider those matters
along with the accusations involving Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   All four legislators enjoy reputations as consensus builders.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Hutchinson, a former federal prosecutor in
Arkansas, worked closely with Rep. Thomas Allen, D-Maine, to draft
a compromise bill to overhaul campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning on the House floor, Hutchinson again warned
against a rush to judgment. ``If we remind ourselves of the
principles established by the drafters of the Constitution then we
will keep our feet on solid ground throughout this proceeding and
we will be well judged by history,'' he said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Berman, a former union lawyer, has a close relationship with
Hyde, and has steadfastly declined to comment on the committee's
actions. His chief of staff's voicemail recording warns reporters
not to bother even leaving a message if the question is about the
impeachment deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Starr's report landed in the committee's lap,
Delahunt, a skilled interrogator and former district attorney in
the Boston area, had won praise from Republicans for his thorough
and even-handed approach on thorny committee issues from music
copyrights to Medicare fraud.
</P>
<P>
   During the committee's contentious debate over what to delete
before making Starr's supporting evidence public, Graham and
Hutchinson each voted with the Democrats in some instances.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, a former Air Force lawyer, has been a persistent critic
of Speaker Newt Gingrich, and helped lead the abortive coup in 1997
that tried to oust Gingrich. When asked to assess his party's
handling of Clinton's videotape deposition, Graham was typically
blunt: ``The Republicans' spin machine is not very good.''

 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are bad weeks, and then there are really bad
weeks. Take the case of Julian Robertson Jr., chairman of Tiger
Management, the world's biggest hedge fund. On Sept. 15, Lincoln
Center officials announced that Robertson had given the center $25
million _ the same day that Robertson's fund announced August
losses of $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Robertson's September losses were at $2 billion,
or 10 percent of the $20 billion he manages, for just the first
half of the month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, look,'' said Robertson. ``We have these things happen.
You can let them drive you crazy, or you can look at them the other
way. Just day before yesterday'' _ Sept. 22 _ ``we were up 20
percent for the year. It's not the end of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds invest money for rich people by using a variety of
strategies, including shorting stocks, or betting that their value
will go down.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week in his Central Park South apartment,
from a 27th floor perch filled with white orchids, three Picassos
and one Cezanne, Robertson elaborated, more or less genially, on
his losses: ``We try to own the best 200 companies in the world,
and short the 200 worst. One of the explanations for our problems
in September is that the 200 worst have been doing a lot better
than the 200 best. And it happens fairly frequently, unfortunately.
That's why everybody doesn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, when asked about his fund's performance over the
last few days, Robertson was not genial at all. ``The press tries
to make this into such a whole deal,'' he said, irritably, from
Germany. ``We lost more money between mid-January and mid-February
than we've lost lately.'' He said last week's $3.5-billion bailout
of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund had no relevance to
his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are leveraged much, much more than we are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson was far happier talking about his $25 million gift to
Lincoln Center, the single largest sum the institution has
received, which he gave in honor of his wife, Josie Robertson, who
has breast cancer. ``She's put up with a lot with me,'' he said.
The fountain plaza has since been renamed the Josie Robertson
Plaza. His wife's illness, Robertson said, ``maybe prompted'' him
to give the gift earlier than he might have.
</P>
<P>
   The two met at a 1968 party in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was in a dress with a cut-out navel,'' Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it wasn't,'' said Mrs. Robertson, who was sitting in on
the interview. She seemed embarrassed, but not that much.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson is six feet tall, bald and a product of one of the
rich old families of Salisbury, N.C., where he grew up with
Elizabeth Dole. A great-aunt, he said, taught him how to read the
stock tables, but he was otherwise an indifferent student. One of
his sisters describes him as irrepressible; other people talk of
his temper.
</P>
<P>
   For years, no one had heard of Robertson outside of the hedge
fund business, and George Soros and his funds got all the
attention. But recently Robertson has become more public, not only
with Lincoln Center but other gifts. Last year he gave $16 million
to the city of Salisbury in honor of his late parents, plus money
for a library at Hollins University to be named for his sister,
Wyndham Robertson, who is chairwoman of the board.
</P>
<P>
   And that was for $3 million?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember,'' he said, turning to his wife. ``Was it
five?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was three,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Robertsons were married in 1972 and have three sons.
Robertson was a broker at Kidder Peabody, but for one year of their
marriage they lived in New Zealand, where Robertson went to try to
write a novel. Before he left, he would read parts of it on the
phone to friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very clear that this was not a great novel,'' said
Wyndham Robertson. ``I don't know how far he got on it, but he just
loved New Zealand.''
</P>
<P>
   After he came back, Robertson started Tiger, in 1980, with $8
million from friends and former clients. By 1991 it had grown to
nearly $1 billion. In 1996, Business Week said that while Soros was
the ``savant'' of the currency markets, Robertson was the
``master'' and ``reigning titan'' of stocks, with ``year after year
of brilliant returns.'' (In 1993, Tiger's funds gained 80 percent
before fees.) But the magazine also said that Robertson might have
lost his touch and that his ``legendary temper'' was driving away
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson responded with a $1 billion libel suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure it wasn't two,'' he said. ``Why not five?'' In
1997, he and Business Week settled: Robertson withdrew his suit,
and Business Week said its predictions of Tiger's investment
performance in 1996 and 1997 were not borne out by results. (Tiger
gained nearly 39 percent after fees in 1996 and 53.7 percent after
fees through Dec. 11, 1997.)
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said he was at the moment working on a transition for
the management of Tiger, so that ``younger people can take over''
and he can retire. He said his plan was to give most of his money
away _ ``Just to make money is kind of ridiculous'' _ but that he
seemed naturally good at making it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, maybe this is what I was put on this earth to do,'' he
said. ``This is the way I can compete, and enjoy.''

   Sam Locke, a writer of plays, books, theater sketches and
television scripts whose roots hark back to the golden days of
radio, died on Sept. 18 at a convalescent center in San Diego. He
was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Locke's credits include scripts for such classic radio programs
as ``Grand Central Station,'' the ``crossroads of a million private
lives,'' and ``Inner Sanctum,'' which opened with an eerily
squeaking door. He wrote sketches for such comedians as Garry
Moore, Red Buttons and Ed Wynn, as well as episodes for hit
television series, among them ``36-24-73'' for ``McHale's Navy,''
``Mooney the Monkey'' for ``The Lucy Show'' and ``Hot Watch'' for
``All in the Family.''
</P>
<P>
   His screenplays tended to take place on beaches. They included
``Girls on the Beach'' for Paramount in 1964 and ``Beach Ball'' for
the same studio the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Locke's one experience with a nonwriting job was a two-week
stint at Macy's during the Christmas season when he was a student
at City College in New York. He hated it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He vowed never again to do any job that was not writing,''
said Esther Jane Paul, a friend who sometimes collaborated with him
on writing projects.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Corwin, one of the best-known radio writers, remembered
Locke as a member of ``the writers' table'' at several Hollywood
studios, forever eager to wittily bite the hands of the tycoons who
fed him. ``The writers shared a common hate of the dinosaurs of the
industry like Louis B. Mayer,'' Corwin said.
</P>
<P>
   For Corwin, Locke represented the sort of journeyman
professionalism that makes the entertainment world spin.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a cantor, Locke was born in Peabody, Mass., but grew
up in New York City, which he considered his hometown even 40 years
after moving to California to write for the new medium of
television. ``Television was kind of a comedown,'' Ms. Paul said.
``He did it because it paid so well.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his success writing for radio, television and
entertainers, writing for his first love, the theater, was hardly
the same sort of gravy train. Only one of his plays reached
Broadway, ``Fair Game,'' which starred Sam Levene. It opened in
November 1957 to lackluster reviews, despite its spirited attempt
to capture the gritty flavor of the garment district.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Laughing Matters,'' published this year, Larry
Gelbart tells of unsuccessfully trying to turn ``Fair Game'' into a
movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Continuous Performance,'' a play about a sex surrogate, which
Locke wrote and produced in Los Angeles, opened and closed quickly
about 10 years ago. But he had more success with ``Women With Red
Hair,'' of which he was a co-author. The play ran off and on for
more than 30 years in such cities as Los Angeles, Rome and Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his Broadway play, Locke, with John LaTouche,
wrote a Broadway musical, ``The Vamp,'' which starred Carol
Channing in a 1955 production. Brooks Atkinson criticized it as
scattered. ``Miss Channing's big, baby-blue eyes stare through the
follies of this huge show as if she could not believe what she is
seeing,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In another book, ``Betty Garrett and Other Songs: A Life on
Stage and Screen,'' Ms. Garrett tells how Locke introduced her to
her husband, the actor Larry Parks. She also recounts the comic
sketch that Locke fashioned for her in which she is interviewed as
her footprints are captured in concrete at Graumann's Chinese
Theater. First created for a dramatic group in New York, the
Flatbush Arts Theater, the sketch was used by the Actors' Lab in
Los Angeles and later by other troupes.
</P>
<P>
   Locke served in the Army Air Corps during World War II and later
worked on a film to help implement the Marshall Plan in Europe. He
wrote fiction and nonfiction for The Saturday Evening Post, True
and other magazines. In the early 1980s he wrote a small humorous
book, ``How to Survive Your Doctor's Care.''
</P>
<P>
   Locke, who was twice divorced, leaves no immediate survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Both Corwin and Ms. Paul suggested that his productivity would
have been even greater had he not been targeted during the McCarthy
era as a frequenter of rallies and parties held by left-wing
organizations. Both said he had been gray-listed, meaning he was
neither banned nor fully accepted.
</P>
<P>
   With a laugh, Ms. Paul said, ``The truth is he went to those
meetings to meet girls.''

HIGH-TECH LOBBY GETTING ITS LEGISLATIVE WISHES IN WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
   By TOM ABATE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
With just over a week until Congress adjourns, the high-tech
industry seems poised to pluck most of the legislative plums it
sought _ although lawmakers may force it to swallow a few lemons.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But savvy lobbyists are predicting that next year, high-tech may
find itself on the legislative defensive.
</P>
<P>
   And one part of the industry _ Internet startups _ is
considering forming a new trade association all its own.
</P>
<P>
   I parachuted onto Capitol Hill this week to watch close up as
tech lobbyists try to steer their pet bills through the normal
end-of-session rush that is compounded by this year's
scandal-mania.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to get four of our top five issues,'' said
American Electronics Association President Bill Archey. At his
Pennsylvania Avenue office, a short walk from the Capitol, he fed
me a tuna sandwich and the AEA party line.
</P>
<P>
   Tech won its most public victory last week, he reminded me, when
the House of Representatives voted to increase the number of H-1B
visas for foreign workers. Unless a giant flying saucer levels
Washington, the Senate will soon pass the same bill, which
President Clinton is expected to sign.
</P>
<P>
   On a less controversial note, a House-Senate conference
committee is trying to iron out one last wrinkle in a bill to
prevent lawyers from filing stock fraud lawsuits against high-tech
execs in state courts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The wrinkle is this: The Securities and Exchange Commission
only agreed to support the rule change after the Senate added
language clarifying the standard of proof it would take to bring a
shareholder suit in federal court. House conferees will have to add
that language to their bill. Archey expects that to happen and for
the president to sign what industry calls National Uniform
Standards.
</P>
<P>
   Two other tech wishes are iffier, but Archey predicted victory.
The Senate should vote today on the Internet Tax Freedom bill,
which would set a three-year moratorium on new Internet taxes.
</P>
<P>
   He also said lawmakers will probably extend the R&AMP;D tax credit,
which expired June 30, until February 2000, allowing firms to apply
part of their research expenses to cutting their tax bills.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech's only big loss was on a bid to give the president
fast track authority to negotiate trade treaties that Congress
could vote up or down but couldn't amend. The export-driven tech
industry wanted fast track, but Congress sided with labor and
environmental opponents who wanted to preserve lawmakers' rights to
tinker with treaties.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Privacy alert? &LR;  This year, tech came to Washington with a
wish list and got most of it, Archey said. But next year, he thinks
Congress will come to town with its own agenda _ to write laws
protecting the privacy of data collected by everyone from catalog
vendors to insurance firms. This affects a range of technology
firms in the database and Internet industries
</P>
<P>
   And if that happens, he said, tech firms _ which loathe
regulation _ may have to expend political capital to fend off
unwanted legislation in favor of self-regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 81 bills in Congress right now on privacy,'' Archey
said.
</P>
<P>
   While most will die when Congress adjourns, many bills will be
resurrected next year. The privacy push springs in part from
consumer anxiety about what's being done with all that personal
information.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Europe will give the United States a kick in its
private parts when the European Directive on Privacy takes effect
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Varney, a former Federal Trade Commission member
turned lobbyist, doesn't expect transatlantic e-commerce to come to
a screeching halt when that occurs. But she said the directive
eventually could force some European firms to quit sharing data
with U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, worldwide financial firms like Visa or American
Express could lose access to credit information about Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why. The EU Directive requires European nations to write
minimum privacy protections into law _ and says European firms
can't swap data with nations that lack such protections.
</P>
<P>
   This is just the beginning of an international tug of war over
privacy, with the United States trying to convince Europeans to
accept U.S.-style self-regulation, while the EU tries to force U.S.
lawmakers to etch privacy rules into stone.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Internet downside?  &LR; Varney said Internet startups didn't fare
nearly as well in this Congress as the AEA's old-guard tech firms.
</P>
<P>
   Her biggest gripe is that even if Congress gives Internet firms
a tax moratorium, lawmakers still seem bent on passing the
so-called CDA (Communications Decency Act) II bill that would
restrict online content deemed ``harmful to minors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call that a win,'' Varney said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Portals of the world, unite! &LR;  Even as the CDA II bill lurches
toward its feared passage, the leading Internet portal companies
will be meeting today in Silicon Valley to discuss whether they
should form their own trade group to lobby on issues that don't
affect the larger tech community.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; John Place, chief legal counsel at Yahoo, said he expects
about 10 to 20 members of the portal crowd to attend. He emphasized
that the meeting is only preliminary. Participants aren't yet sure
they have enough in common to create a group.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Harter, government relations chief at Netscape, will be at
the event. He said attendees will debate whether Internet startups
should form a new trade association or join the Internet Alliance.
That's the Washington trade group that America Online is trying to
make into the ``voice of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The Alliance lists Netscape as a member , along with
Microsoft, AT&AMP;T, Bell Atlantic and Citibank.
</P>
<P>
   Who gets in bed with whom is industry politics at its rawest.
I'm told that neither Microsoft nor AOL will be in attendance at
the Silicon Valley conclave but could be drawn in later.
</P>
<P>
   Got a tip, gripe or brainstorm? Tom Abate wants to hear it by
phone (650-961-2689), fax (650-961-5023) or e-mail
(abate &LR; sfgate.com).  &LR;

HASBRO ADDS GALOOB TO ITS TOY CHEST 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAN FOST  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
   In a deal that will bring the Star Wars toy franchise under one
roof but spells the end of independence for the Bay Area's largest
toy company, industry giant Hasbro Inc. said yesterday that it will
buy Galoob Toys of South San Francisco for $220 million.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hasbro, the nation's second-largest toy company after Mattel,
owns well-known brands such as Playskool, Kenner, Tonka, Milton
Bradley and Parker Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Galoob, which ranks a distant third among American toymakers, is
best known for its line of tiny MicroMachines vehicles, Pound
Puppies and, more recently, Spice Dolls toys.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro said it likely will consolidate some operations,
resulting in possible layoffs. Galoob employs about 216 people,
half of them in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro's main interest in Galoob probably was the latter's
license to sell small-scale Star Wars vehicles, figures and
playsets.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Hasbro had the first license to make toys based on
the original ``Star Wars'' and its sequels. But Hasbro let the
license lapse in 1991, figuring that the phenomenon had run its
course.
</P>
<P>
   Galoob later stepped in and revived the Star Wars toy franchise,
which spurred renewed interest by Hasbro.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, with anticipation starting to build for the upcoming
Star Wars ``prequel'' trilogy, Hasbro, Galoob and Mattel engaged in
a high-stakes bidding war for rights to make toys based on the
three new movies.
</P>
<P>
   Lucasfilm Ltd., the San Rafael producer of the Star Wars
franchise, sold the rights for small toys to Galoob and for other
toys, including action figures and games, to Hasbro.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Galoob paid Lucasfilm warrants for about 20 percent of
Galoob's stock and a promise to pay $140 million against future
royalties as the new films are released.
</P>
<P>
   The first of those is scheduled for theatrical release in May
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Galoob had a strong year in 1996, thanks to Lucasfilm's
theatrical rerelease of the three original Star Wars films.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1997, without the help of ``Star Wars'' in theaters,
Galoob lost $2.7 million on sales of $240 million.
</P>
<P>
   And in the first half of this year, things got even worse and
Galoob lost $5.1 million on revenues of $70.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Galoob stock, which hit almost $35 a share in late 1996, sank as
low as $6.63 this year.
</P>
<P>
   It closed yesterday at $11.44, up $3.44 _ a gain of 43 percent _
on the news of the deal. Hasbro has offered $12 for each share of
Galoob stock. Hasbro stock closed at $30, down $1.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro, which is based in Pawtucket, R.I., and had sales of $3.2
billion last year, said it had started mulling an offer for Galoob
earlier this year and reached an agreement with the company Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Galoob is a solid company,'' said Wayne Charness, senior vice
president of corporate communications for Hasbro. ``We will look to
companies we think we can take to the next level, and Galoob is one
of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Galoob officials could not be reached for comment
yesterday afternoon, President and CEO Mark Goldman said in a press
release, ``We are excited about joining Hasbro. Hasbro's global
reach and resources will enormously expand the potential of
Galoob's brands, especially `Star Wars' and Micro Machines.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Frankel and Lewis Galoob founded the company in 1954 as
an import business.
</P>
<P>
   When Lewis Galoob died in 1971, his 21-year-old son, David
Galoob, became president. He led the company's tremendous growth,
piloting such original lines as Baby Talk, a talking doll, and
MicroMachines miniature cars.
</P>
<P>
   The company went public in 1984, and David Galoob became
chairman and CEO in 1988. But even as Galoob Toys grew, it
struggled to become profitable. David Galoob stepped aside in 1991,
paving the way for Goldman to run the company.
</P>
<P>
   David Galoob could not be reached for comment yesterday. But his
sister, Linda Galoob Schneidman, 51, of San Francisco, said the
acquisition of the company was sad but probably inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not going to be any toy companies left,'' Schneidman
said. ``When we were in the business, there were a lot of
independent, privately owned toy companies. They were all bought
out by either Hasbro or Mattel. It's a very different business
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst John Taylor, who follows the toy industry for Arcadia
Investment Corp. in Portland, Ore., agreed. ``Companies like Hasbro
and Mattel spend more in advertising than Galoob generates in
revenue,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the deal makes sense for Hasbro.
</P>
<P>
   The company now can consolidate the Star Wars licenses, extend
Galoob's domestic strength with Hasbro's worldwide reach and make
serious inroads into Mattel's dominance in small toy cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works for me,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucasfilm officials declined to comment, issuing only a
one-sentence statement congratulating the companies on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, the analyst, said he believes that Lucasfilm will
approve the transfer of the Star Wars license from Galoob to
Hasbro.
</P>
<P>
   The deal should close later this year if it gets approved by the
federal government and shareholders of both companies.

D'AMATO AND SCHUMER INTENSIFY CLASH OVER CRIME ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Wrestling over two issues that have become
central to the Senate campaign, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato lined up on
Monday the endorsements of a half-dozen police union leaders in an
effort to underscore his crime-fighting credentials, as Rep.Charles
Schumer assailed him as ``the most anti-education senator in the
history of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato posed in Manhattan with leaders of the New York City
Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, among other unions, and
asserted that their support put to rest any question that Schumer,
D-Brooklyn, had raised about his crime legislation record. The news
conference suggested some concern in the senator's camp over the
effort by Schumer to steal the crime issue away from D'Amato, who
is seeking a fourth term.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this campaign,'' D'Amato said, ``there is perhaps no issue
where my opponent and I differ more. Chuck Schumer has consistently
voted for weaker crime laws.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato moved to undercut Schumer's attempt to cast himself as a
``tough-on-crime Democrat'' by pointing to a series of votes
Schumer had cast, much the same way that Schumer has pointed to
individual votes D'Amato has cast. For example, D'Amato said,
Schumer in Congress had opposed some mandatory sentences for
felons, and as a State assemblyman in the 1970s had backed
weakening some drug laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike some of those who try to fashion themselves as being
tough and for the police and seeing to it that we create a safer
society,'' D'Amato said, ``and who have voted repeatedly against
mandatory sentences, I have been there on the battle line. That's
the difference between Senator D'Amato and those who pretend to be
tough and understand what you need to take on the criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of state Democratic leaders here, Schumer opened a
new line of attack on D'Amato, saying he regularly voted with
Senate Republicans in opposing measures to rebuild the nation's
schools. Schumer criticized D'Amato for voting to pare college
tuition programs, reduce school lunch subsidies, eliminate the
Department of Education and impose federal performance standards on
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer suggested that D'Amato had inaugurated his re-election
campaign last year with ads attacking the teachers unions as a way
of deflecting public attention from some of his votes on education
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't fix the schools by hammering teachers,'' Schumer
said, with the Democratic leaders listening intently as they picked
over half-eaten salads. ``You can't fix the schools through a
negative media onslaught directed and conceived by a cynical
politician desperately trying to mask his failing record. You can't
fix the schools by constantly voting to take away funding, or
tools, or standards, to make them better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I say this to you, Al D'Amato: If you are not going to lead,
if you are not going to help, then get out of the way and let us
all do something for our children.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange between the two candidates came at the start of the
second full week of the general election campaign. Their speeches,
which came within two hours of one another, left little doubt that
this race, crunched into a seven-week span because of New York's
late primary, is not about to slow down any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   It also showed the extent to which Schumer and D'Amato are
employing the identical tactic of using their rivals' legislative
history as a weapon. Both have assembled databases on every vote
the other has taken over their careers _ sometimes on legislation
of substance, but other times on procedural votes. The results of
that preparation have never been more obvious than on Monday as the
two campaigns fired up their fax machines with detailed accounts of
both their opponent's and their own votes on crime and education.
</P>
<P>
   The PBA has endorsed D'Amato in every one of his elections since
he first ran for the Senate in 1980. Police endorsements of
Republican incumbents are typically pro forma events intended to
underscore the advantage Republicans tend to have on the crime
issue. But in this case, D'Amato showed he may be somewhat
concerned that Schumer has succeeded in at least neutralizing the
issue, both with bills he pushed in Congress (notably, a ban on
assault weapons and the Brady Bill) and his almost pre-emptive
attack on D'Amato on crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I devote a lot of time and energy to fighting crime,'' D'Amato
said. ``I wrote the federal death penalty for drug kingpins. That's
my law. That's my legislation. I fought for tough mandatory jail
sentences for violent criminals, including for those who used a gun
in the commission of a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The PBA head, Lou Matarazzo, who said he represented a coalition
of 38,000 active officers, declined a reporter's invitation to
assess Schumer's efforts on the subject. ``I'm not going to discuss
Chuck Schumer's crime record,'' he said. ``If his crime record was
better than Senator D'Amato's, I would be at his headquarters, not
the senator's.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA, Cuba _ The veteran actors from Repertorio Espanol had
performed the play ``Broken Eggs'' dozens of times before, in New
York City, but on Sunday they took the stage here with the
nervousness of beginners. One feared she would become so emotional
she would lose her concentration. Another said he was terrified he
would open his mouth and nothing would come out.
</P>
<P>
   But when the lights finally came on, the actors managed to keep
their composure as an audience of 300 people applauded each time a
familiar face came on stage, shrieked with laughter at lines like
``Do you remember when we used to think Fidel was sexy?'' and
sprung to their feet for a final standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   In a show that had the quality of a special, almost stolen
moment, Cuba welcomed the first Cuban-Americans invited here since
the two countries severed relations in 1961, some returning to the
same stage where they worked before their exile.
</P>
<P>
   Of the company's nine actors seven are Cuban-Americans. Among
them is a singer-actress returning to the island for the first time
in 38 years, a gay actor who was among those labeled
``undesirable'' and sent to farm camps in the 1960s, a television
actress who fled on the 1980 boatlift from Mariel and two young
American-born actors discovering the homeland of their parents.
</P>
<P>
   And in the audience were relatives and strangers, friends and
old colleagues who knew some of the actors from work in Cuban
theater and radio half a century ago. Some said they recognized as
their own the idiosyncrasies in ``Broken Eggs,'' a nostalgia-filled
comedy about a three-generation Cuban family living in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuba is their land and is always present in their lives,''
said Georgina Almanza, 65, an actress who walked out of the theater
sniffling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broken Eggs'' (``Revoltillo'' in Spanish) opened here in a
cultural exchange that underscores how a rapprochement that has
been elusive in the political arena is being accomplished through
the arts.
</P>
<P>
   The exchanges are allowed under the American economic embargo as
``people to people'' contacts, which American officials favor as a
way of exposing Cubans to a democratic society, and the Cubans to
foster goodwill in hostile territory.
</P>
<P>
   They have become increasingly common, although more Cubans have
crossed over to the United States than American counterparts to
Cuba. In the first seven months of this year 183 Cuban artists
visited the United States but only 9 Americans visited Cuba, mostly
to explore future exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   While American theater groups have come here in the past, and a
major New York City producer is expected soon for talks about
bringing a hit Broadway musical to Havana next year, most recent
contact has been through Repertorio Espanol, a 30-year-old
nonprofit company in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The company is led by Gilberto Zaldivar, its co-founder and
producer, who returned to Cuba in 1995 after a 34-year absence and
epitomizes the more conciliatory stance many exiles adopt toward
Cuba after renewing old ties.
</P>
<P>
   Although Zaldivar was drawn here by the illness of two uncles,
that visit led to contacts in the theater community and the first
cultural exchange _Cubans working with Repertorio Espanol in New
York in 1996. Others Cuban performances in New York followed before
the group won permission from both governments to bring here, by
invitation from the Union of Writers and Artists, what Zaldivar and
his associate producer, Robert Weber, consider the best play by the
Cuban-born playwright Eduardo Machado.
</P>
<P>
   Machado, who left Cuba when he was 8, has scheduled his own
return on Tuesday, when the company is scheduled to play in
Matanzas as part of a 10-day, three-city tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only natural that this takes place,'' Zaldivar said.
``It's logical, normal and human that these two Cuban communities
communicate. We can significantly help create the climate for
future relations.''
</P>
<P>
   The pioneering exchange came at a cost, however: one of
Repertorio's Cuban-American board members resigned in protest, and
there have even been death threats from those who favor isolating
the island to cause its government's downfall.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the anger focused on Ana Margarita Martinez-Casado, a
well-known actress from the 1970s American television sitcom ``Que
Pasa, U.S.A.?'' who lost an advertising contract with a Miami
hospital over the Cuba visit.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Martinez-Casado, who started her career here as a soprano on
television, left in 1960 with her 2-year-old daughter, never
returning from a job in Puerto Rico after the man who was then her
husband warned her from Cuba that the political situation was
getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   She lived in Mexico, Miami and now New York City, and saw her
mother only when she visited Mexico once. Her father died in 1989,
followed by her mother two years later, without ever seeing her
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many years we thought, things will change soon, and the
years kept passing by,'' she said, citing political, economic and
work-related reasons for not coming to Cuba before now. ``There
comes a point where one asks, `Why not go?'''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, at Havana's airport, she held the two brothers she
had not seen in 38 years in a tight embrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look just like Papi did when I left,'' she told one
brother, Luis, 64, a Cuban diplomat, through tears. ``And you, who
used to look like him, now look more like my mother,'' she told
Manuel, 63, a beer company salesman whose own daughter and two sons
have also left Cuba and live in Miami.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Martinez-Casado, calling her Chuchi, an endearing
nickname she had not heard in a long time, told her, ``I want to
hear you sing.''
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Martinez-Casado was driven through old haunts she barely
recognized _ past revolutionary slogans on billboards and posters
of Pope John Paul II on Old Havana's front doors, through the time
warp of Chevrolets and Fords from the 1940s and 50s and with a
cemetery stop to bid a belated goodbye to her parents _ troupe
members like Ricardo Barber, 61, got reacquainted with once
inseparable colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   At a welcoming reception by the artists' union, Barber chatted
with Ana Molinet, 56, an actress who once waged a three-month
campaign, including slipping a note to Fidel Castro during a public
appearance, to get Barber released from an agricultural camp for
homosexuals and other victims of political persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Barber spent a year cutting cane from dawn to dusk before he was
released and went back to the theater, but he chose to leave Cuba
for good in 1977. His first visit back was in 1995, with Zaldivar.
``I wasn't the same'' after the forced labor, Barber said. ``I no
longer believed in the revolution and I began to see the bad in
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   While the arts have flourished under Communist rule, benefiting
from government sponsorship and a national system of specialized
schools, the Cuban-Americans have found an artistic class hobbled
by the economic problems of the country, despite the privileged
status of a few. Television programming has been cut back to
conserve energy. Films are limited to two or three a year, often
co-productions with other countries.
</P>
<P>
   And many theaters have closed, while those that remain are often
shabby and inadequately equipped.
</P>
<P>
   Still, tourism and travel have created new opportunities for
artists, and officials consider those who tour abroad ambassadors
who ``foment understanding, make us known and favor dialogue,''
said Ismael Gonzalez, a deputy minister of culture. Artists who
travel internationally are also an important source of revenue
(although exchanges with the United States are governed by embargo
restrictions on both earnings and spending), but individuals'
allegiances to the government vary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them keep quiet and make art,'' a Western official
here noted. Carlos Padron, a playwright who presides over the
1,600-member Association of Stage Artists, said the exchanges
mostly answer to a yearning for knowing how the other side lives.
``Six of 10 Cubans have family in the United States,'' he said.
``People want to see what really happens to people over there, how
they insert themselves in North American society, to what extent
they maintain their identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Repertorio members have been the toast of the town here,
enjoying favorable press coverage, welcoming receptions and a quick
sellout of shows (tickets have sold for the equivalent of 25
cents). But a company member's cousin was arrested and briefly
detained for staying overnight in the relative's hotel and another
Repertorio member on a beach outing had to talk a traffic officer
out of arresting a friend suspected of being an unauthorized
chauffeur. Cubans are not allowed in hotels as guests, and
vigilance appears heightened since last year's hotel bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctant to delve into politics or criticize their hosts, some
Repertorio members instead talked about their hope to create
bridges for eventual democratic change in Cuba, and at times seemed
in awe of their compatriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their spirit of struggle fascinates me,'' said Rene Sanchez,
71, who had an acting career here before leaving in 1966. ``How
they invent things, how they try to figure out a better living, how
they don't allow themselves to collapse even in the worst of
times.''
</P>
<P>
   The last could also be said for Repertorio members. Hurricane
Georges and immigration problems delayed the arrival of some of the
actors and caused the cancellation of the two first Havana shows
this weekend. Then, for the first of two scheduled performances on
Sunday, the actress Tatiana Vecino got sick and a Cuban actress,
Adria Santana, stepped in to read the role.
</P>
<P>
   By evening, the Teatro Hubert de Blanck filled up again for the
second show. Ms. Vecino recovered and returned to her role. But at
intermission it was announced that the rest of the performance
would be canceled. An electric transformer on the street had
shorted out and the theater was forced to shut off its power.
</P>
<P>
   The theatergoers were told more performances would be added next
weekend, and many had already seen enough to come back for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was thrilling,'' said Osmara Velazquez, 54, a cousin of
Zaldivar's. ``Incredibly, culture has ended the separation.''

MONTREAL MANAGER IS FRONT RUNNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Although they will not play again for six months,
the Los Angeles Dodgers 1999 season opened Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The first pitch was thrown by Montreal Expos president Claude
Brochu, who said he will not block any attempts to let Felipe Alou
become the next manager of the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am surprised and disappointed,'' Brochu said Monday,
responding to speculation that Alou is the front runner. ``If that
is his wish, I will not go against it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the moves the Dodgers make _ or don't make _ this
offseason, naming a manager who can get the most out of this club
after another underachieving season is critical.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many issues facing the Dodgers right now, from the
$53 million already committed to 12 players to their last-place
finish in the NL in on-base percentage to batting with runners in
scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   New general manager Kevin Malone knows his overall payroll could
reach $75 million without making many changes to the team that
finished 83-79 and well out of any postseason race. But he also
knows he can't sit still, especially after the team's purchase last
March by Rupert Murdoch for $311 million.
</P>
<P>
   Malone spent much of Monday with Murdoch's Fox people in a
season-ending staff meeting. Alou flew from St. Louis, where his
team finished the season 65-97 and gave up the last five of Mark
McGwire's 70 home runs, to his home in West Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Alou, 63, was scheduled to undergo a checkup on his prostate,
which required surgery two years ago for a cancerous tumor. His
health has been excellent since the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Alou, who has one year at $600,000 left on his Montreal
contract, told his coaches Sunday, ``I am ready to go.'' And after
Expos GM Jim Beattie asked him about the Dodgers job, Alou said,
``That question to me was an invitation to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone, however, was diplomatic on Monday when asked about
Brochu's comments. Malone still has a manager in Glenn Hoffman, who
is not expected to return. But until a decision is made (within a
day or two), Malone says it is inappropriate to discuss Alou.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to meet with the manager and coaches first,'' Malone
said. ``I plan on doing that in the next couple of days; discuss
their futures with with them. Then I'll discuss what happens with
our manager and coaching positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone, 40, so far has tried to get things done quickly. In his
first two weeks on the job, he named a new farm director, Bill
Geivett, and new assistant to the general manager, Ed Creech.
Malone also has begun interviewing candidates for a position
handling the business side of the baseball operation.
</P>
<P>
   And on the field, the Dodgers have other issues to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Malone needs to find out from closer Jeff Shaw if there is any
way he will remain with the club. Because he was traded during a
multiyear contract, Shaw has 30 days to demand a trade and is
expected to do so. Malone, who was Shaw's GM in Montreal, said the
two have a good relationship. Malone will travel to Shaw's home in
Ohio within two weeks to see if the situation can be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Malone also has to try to undo the bottleneck of guaranteed
contracts that is choking his ability to build next year's team.
</P>
<P>
   The most glaring item is the $11.8 million owed Bobby Bonilla,
who had an awful season coming off surgery to his left wrist and
Achilles' tendon. Malone desperately wants to move Bonilla, but
there isn't much of a market for a 35-year-old third baseman who
carries all that baggage.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Malone convinces Gary Sheffield to move from right field
to left, that leaves the Dodgers paying $18 million next year for
Sheffield and Raul Mondesi _ and they've yet to get a center
fielder.
</P>
<P>
   The job in center should also include a leadoff hitter. Second
baseman Eric Young played well in spurts, but he also missed almost
50 games with foot and thigh injuries. On-base percentage is
critical to driving an offense. Last year, no one was worse than
the Dodgers. And Young has three years at $4.5 million per left on
his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Ramon Martinez could come back before the All-Star game
after undergoing rotator cuff surgery last June, the Dodgers need a
No.1 starter. The top free-agent candidates, San Diego's Kevin
Brown and Houston's Randy Johnson, will command multiyear contracts
worth $10-12 million per season.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Murdoch's deep pockets, Malone says that is too much.
Which brings the Dodgers back to Alou. He has been saddled with
some of baseball's smallest payrolls the past few years. He even
had to lose his son, Moises, to free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``But without a doubt there is no one who wants to win more than
him,'' said Carlos Perez, who came over from Montreal in a
six-player trade on July 31. ``He would be perfect here. Nobody
makes a team feel better about themselves than him.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou and Malone helped put together the 1994 Expos, who finished
with baseball's best record (74-40) before a labor impasse ended
the season. Within a 48-hour period the next winter, Malone was
forced to unload three of his top players: Larry Walker, John
Wetteland and Marquis Grissom.
</P>
<P>
   This year he has the money to make a difference. Play ball.

U.S. ASKS BRITAIN TO DELIVER SUSPECTED BIN LADEN AIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A British court ordered a suspect held Monday pending
extradition to the United States as part of the broadening
investigation into Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who is being
investigated in connection with bombing of two U.S. embassies last
month in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Khalid al Fawwaz, is believed to be the leader of
bin Laden's organization in Britain, according to a short summary
of the case offered Monday by British authorities. Al Fawwaz was
sought in the United States under a sealed complaint filed in U.S.
District Court in Manhattan, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, declined to give
details about the complaint. But she said in a statement that al
Fawwaz had been arrested on a warrant charging him with
``conspiring with Mr. Bin Laden and others to murder United States
nationals.''
</P>
<P>
   An indictment was handed down Monday against the two defendants
charged in complaints last month in connection with a conspiracy to
bomb the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya. They were indicted on
charges that they were also involved in the bombing of the embassy
in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants, Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali and Mohammed
Saddiq Odeh, were indicted by a federal grand jury in Manhattan on
four counts, including charges of conspiring to bomb, the bombings
and conspiracy to murder American civilians. More than 250 people
died in the attacks, and hundreds were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment does not offer details on their roles in the
Tanzania attack.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also asserts for the first time that bin Laden's
organization, Al Qaeda, took its stand against the United States
for, among other factors, ``the arrest, conviction and
imprisonment'' of people belonging to ``Al Qaeda and its affiliated
terrorist groups, including Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman,'' the Egyptian
clergyman who was convicted in 1995 in a plot to bomb landmarks in
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, U.S. District Judge John Sprizzo, who had been
assigned to the Manhattan case of the Texan accused of being bin
Laden's personal secretary, Wadih el Hage, said he was withdrawing
from the matter. Sprizzo said in a hearing that as a private lawyer
before being appointed a judge in 1981 he had represented the
Libyan government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given what appear to be allegations of their worldwide
participation in terrorist activity and my perception as to how
this case is likely to go,'' Sprizzo said in court, ``I don't think
it would be appropriate for me to sit in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge added that he had represented the Libyans over two or
three years and ``got to know some high officials of the Libyan
government, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Although el Hage has been charged only with lying in the
investigation of bin Laden, Sprizzo said, ``It seems to me that a
lot else will be coming into this case at some point.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge declined further comment by phone. A court history
notes that he was in private practice with the firm of Curtis,
Mallet-Prevost, Colt &AMP; Mosle from 1970 to 1981. The case will be
reassigned.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether al Fawwaz's extradition was sought in
connection with the embassy attacks or as part of the broader
investigation of bin Laden. A brief summary of the case offered by
the British authorities said al Fawwaz's duties included
transmitting bin Laden's fatwahs, or death sentences against people
found to have offended Islam.
</P>
<P>
   The summary document said that in one case Fawwaz transmitted a
fatwah that declared a holy war against American citizens. He was
able to send it through an intermediary ``to the eventual publisher
and personally vouched for its authenticity,'' the document said,
without supplying details.
</P>
<P>
   Al Fawwaz, 36, was arrested Wednesday with six other suspects.
He was released Sunday, said a spokesman for Scotland Yard.
</P>
<P>
   Later on Sunday he was rearrested on the extradition warrant,
the spokesman said. One British official, who insisted on
anonymity, said the rearrest was at the request of U.S.
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Al Fawwaz was described in The Times of London on Sunday as an
executive and one-time close ally of bin Laden who ran the London
office of a Saudi dissidents' group that bin Laden had founded. The
newspaper said al Fawwaz was involved in monitoring the press and
distributing communiques.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Akhtar Raja, said Monday night that he had no
comment.

 &HT;    Playoffs in Atlanta could be quite damp, thanks to Georges
 &HT;    By Steve Visser
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tropical Storm Georges is casting a cloud over Braves playoff
games Wednesday and Thursday as the former hurricane creeps into
Georgia from Alabama bringing much-needed but untimely rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks to be a slow mover right now. That's bad,'' said
Jonathan Atwell, a hydrologist with the Southeast River Forecast
Center in Peachtree City. ``We're good at least through Wednesday
... but as it unfolds, we could have close to 8 inches. We'll just
have to see how it pans out.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service's report says the storm could
produce between one-half inch and one inch of rain through
Wednesday. The storm has already dumped 20 inches on the Florida
Panhandle, said meteorologist Jim Blair.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of rainfall doesn't worry Turner Field, which can
always hand rainchecks to fans if it looks like the downpour will
continue nonstop during this week's games.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as it stops raining, we can play,'' said Ed Mangan,
field director.
</P>
<P>
   A cooling trend is in the forecast. Temperatures today are
expected to be mostly in the 80s. On Wednesday, the mercury should
hover between the upper 70s and lower 80s and by Thursday it should
run in the 70s in the north and the 80s in the south. By Saturday
the 70s should rule, except in the mountains, where temperatures
could dip into the upper 60s, and the far south where they could
stay in the 80s.

LAZARD TO PAY $9 MILLION IN YIELD-BURNING SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lazard Freres &AMP; Co., the Wall Street investment bank,
has agreed to pay $9 million to settle a civil lawsuit brought by
the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Agency accusing Lazard
of grossly overcharging the agency in a 1993 bond transaction,
participants in the settlement said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal marks the first time a major Wall Street firm has
agreed to settle a civil suit related to a bond-sales practice that
in the 1990s came to be known as ``yield burning,'' or profiting
heavily by vastly inflating the prices of government securities.
The settlement is also the largest yet of the many yield-burning
cases that have been filed against Wall Street firms.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Los Angeles agency voted to approve the
settlement Monday. Lazard Freres officials could not immediately be
reached for comment. The firm agreed to settle the case last week.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement comes as federal investigators are examining
whether yield-burning schemes took place in hundreds of other
municipal transactions around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year the Securities and Exchange Commission brought
its first yield-burning case, against Rauscher Pierce Refsnes, now
part of Dain Rauscher, for engaging in what the SEC called the
fraudulent markup of government securities. And in April,
Corestates Financial Corp. agreed to pay $3.7 million to settle
contentions that its brokerage firm unit had overcharged investors
and the federal government in a series of transactions in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators and lawyers involved in these cases and
many others say that several Wall Street firms have entered into
discussions for a broader settlement that would resolve all claims
by various federal agencies related to yield burning.
</P>
<P>
   In the Lazard case, the Los Angeles agency contended that it
lost $3 million in the 1993 transaction. The settlement resolves
all claims brought by the agency, including the repayment of the
financial advisory fee to Lazard between 1991 and 1994, lawyers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lissack, a former investment banker, initiated the
lawsuit against Lazard under the California False Claims Act. He
could receive as much as $3 million of the settlement money, his
attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   But John Phillips, principal of the Washington law firm of
Phillips &AMP; Cohen, which litigated the suit in behalf of the Los
Angeles agency and Lissack, said the deal was part of a broader
effort to settle widespread claims of fraud in the municipal bond
market in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where all the cases will ultimately come to,''
Phillips said Monday. ``There is no escape. This same yield-burning
practice has occurred in hundreds of government refundings between
1990 and 1994, and these cases will either be settled or
litigated.''

HURRICANE GEORGES MOVES INLAND, LOSES SOME OF ITS PUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to update; 4th graf is new.)  
 (ATTN: La., Ala., Miss., Fla.)  (lh) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ From the eastern reaches of New Orleans to
Pensacola, Fla., Hurricane Georges pounded the Gulf Coast on Monday
with destructive winds and even more destructive rains, then slowly
began to lose some of its punch as it drifted inland.
</P>
<P>
   Battering the beaches, towns and cities of Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle with winds up to 100
miles an hour and more than a foot of rain, it left trees uprooted,
power lines down, roads washed out and hundreds of homes and
businesses badly knocked about or flooded.
</P>
<P>
   It spawned tornadoes, most of them harmless, though the winds of
one were clocked at 174 miles an hour as it spun past an airport.
The hurricane pounded a crippled ship and the tug that was towing
it so hard that Coast Guard officials worried both might founder.
And it was blamed for two deaths in New Orleans, one occurring when
an elderly woman suffered a heart attack while being evacuated from
her flooded home and the other occurring when a man set his
darkened house afire while trying to light it with a candle.
</P>
<P>
   The storm was also blamed for the death of a Pensacola woman who
was killed Sunday in a house fire. Authorities believe she was
lighting a candle because there was no power.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters, along with public safety officials, warned that
because the storm was so saturated with rain after a slow meander
across the tropical waters of the Gulf, and because it was moving
inland so slowly, the Gulf Coast and the rest of the Deep South
should be on the lookout for heavy flooding over the next several
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not quite out of the water yet,'' Police Chief Ben
Morris told the residents of Slidell, La., on the Mississippi
border, as they began to emerge from shelters and boarded up homes
to take up the task of cleaning up behind Georges.
</P>
<P>
   But despite all the misery and grief caused when Georges roared
ashore out of the Gulf before daybreak Monday morning, its eye
centered on Biloxi, Miss., the storm was not its old killer self.
</P>
<P>
   It could not sustain its 100-mile-an-hour-plus winds for long
once it began to drag over land, leading weather forecasters to
predict, cautiously, that it would probably blow itself out in the
next few days. Moreover, Gulf Coast residents, given plenty of
warning that Georges earlier had killed 300 people and left 100,000
more homeless down in the Caribbean, largely avoided its worst by
battening down ahead of time and fleeing, when they could, to
higher ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could have been a lot worse,'' Kenny Campo, a marina operator
said, as he surveyed his mostly unscathed place in low-lying St.
Bernard Parish, southeast of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Pensacola was awash in more than 20 inches of rain that fell
there in less than 24 hours. But for all that, flood damage was
relatively minor in most places.
</P>
<P>
   A few streets in downtown Mobile, Ala., were waist-deep in sea
water, and the causeway leading southeast out of town was hit by a
sea surge that swept away some stores and restaurants. Yet most of
the city's businesses and homes escaped.
</P>
<P>
   One Mobile resident, Sandra Pettway, was less traumatized by
Georges than the 8-foot alligator it drove up into the housing
project in which she lives with her three children. ``Some people
were shooting at him,'' she said. ``But I didn't have a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   In Biloxi, there was also flooding. But the town's main
attraction, its casinos, largely escaped serious damage _ though
not a loss of revenue from having to shut down for several days. A
few miles further west, in Gulfport, the wind blew so hard at one
point that it toppled over an 18-wheel tractor-trailer on
Interstate 10.
</P>
<P>
   But most houses and businesses escaped with only a scratch or
two. And in New Orleans, the place where Georges potentially could
have caused a huge catastrophe _ the city as the Gulf Coast's
largest concentration of people and lies 6 feet below sea level
behind its levees _ there was hardly any real damage except along
the shores of Lake Ponchartrain, where storm-driven waves smashed a
line of fishing shacks and cottages.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   By late afternoon, with Georges beginning to slowly drift off
toward the northeast and winds and rains letting up a bit, New
Orleanians, especially those hunkered down in makeshift shelters
like the Superdome, began to chafe for their freedom.
</P>
<P>
   A curfew was still in effect _ ``for your safety until we can
get things straightened out a bit,'' Mayor Marc Morial said _ but
with each passing hour it was ignored by more and more people. Down
in the old French Quarter, Chris LeBoeuf ventured forth and opened
his souvenir shop. And in no time customers were arriving,
especially tourists who had been trapped in their hotels for two
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come in, and they're just glad to have some place to go
for a change,'' LeBoeuf said. The police let it go.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the city's store owners, Frank Ordano, complained
that power company crews had not been fast enough getting power
restored. ''There's no bad weather here,'' he declared. ``Sunday
was a little bit rainy and wind, Monday even less so.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Mobile, by late in the day, the had-enough-of-all-this
story was much the same, though the wind there was still blowing up
to 60 miles an hour, and the rain was still coming down. Debbie
Stephens, hunkered down at home rather than in a shelter, said she
and her family were safe enough but the power was out and ``there's
just nothing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just about to die from boredom,'' she continued. ``There's
no power, no television, no stereo. You can't read. We've played
all the games. And now everybody's eating everything in sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Kirk Fordice of Mississippi said after an early look at the
damage in his state that while Mississippians had been lucky,
foresight also had played a major role in limiting loss. ``The
preparation for this emergency,'' he said, ``is much better than in
years past.''
</P>
<P>
   Weather forecasters predicted that because Georges began to lose
some of its punch as soon as it came ashore early Monday morning,
it probably would lose still more power overnight as it inched
further inland _ barring an unexpected resurgence of energy. By
Tuesday, they said, its maximum sustained winds should be well
below 75 miles an hour, the hurricane force threshold.

   The New York Times' computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times' computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is a very large
difference between Ohio State (No. 1) and Nebraska (No. 2), but
there is a much smaller difference between Tennessee (No. 3) and
West Virginia (No. 4).

LITTLE SISTER  
 LESSON IN DEMOCRACY  
 LIT WIT  
 CLINTON FAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES BARRON with JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It cannot have been easy being Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis' younger sister, and Caroline Lee Bouvier Canfield
Radziwill Ross, better known as Lee Radziwill, is going to set the
record straight. Her autobiography, ``The Way It Was,'' was
purchased Monday by Random House.
</P>
<P>
   Random House said the book would be published in 2001 and would
cover Ms. Radziwill's childhood; her relationship with Mrs. Onassis
before, during and after the White House years, and her three
marriages _ to the publishing heir Michael Canfield, to the exiled
Polish nobleman Stanislas Radziwill and, since 1988, to Herbert
Ross, the film director and choreographer. Ms. Radziwill was a
regular at jet-set parties and has had scads of high-profile
friends, including Truman Capote, Andy Warhol and Rudolf Nureyev.
</P>
<P>
   Her agent, Andrew Wylie, said that she was writing the book
herself _ no ghostwriter to tell it the way she wishes it had been.
He said that she works in longhand.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear how much Ms. Radziwill intended to
rebut gossipy biographies like ``In Her Sister's Shadow: An
Intimate Biography of Lee Radziwill'' (Little, Brown, 1995), which
portrayed her as a competitive sibling and something of a social
climber.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Random House nor Wylie said how much she would be paid
for the book.
</P>
<P>
   Conducting Business
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Tchaikovsky you're playing,'' the conductor Yuri
Temirkanov told the clarinetist in the Manhattan School of Music
Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble was, the piece Temirkanov was conducting was
Shostakovich's Symphony No. 10, written in 1953, when the Cold War
was at its height and Shostakovich was gaining a reputation for
dissent. Temirkanov, the music director of the St. Petersburg
Philharmonic, conducted a reading of the piece _ which is by turns
warlike and brooding _ as part of a daylong symposium on
Shostakovich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any great music of any great composer is dated,'' Temirkanov
said during a break. He mentioned Brahms and Bach, adding, ``But
when time passes, they don't lose meaning or intensity, because
they're universal. The same for Shostakovich.''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment a man appeared at the dressing room door and
said, ``One minute, Temirkanov.'' Temirkanov sprayed Eau Sauvage
cologne on his neck and started back to the podium.
</P>
<P>
   ``How different in America,'' his assistant, Marina Stokes,
said. ``In Russia, if he wants to sit here and talk for two hours,
everyone waits. Here, someone comes and says, `You have one
minute.''' In Russia, that person would be sacked the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   Book Country
</P>
<P>
   The ``New York Is Book Country'' brunch had the Waldorf-Astoria
laughing as if it were a comedy club.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery writer Robert B. Parker urged people not to go to
the library, but rather to buy his books or even steal them, since
authors are paid for the number of books shipped.
</P>
<P>
   Then Parker, who is writing a novel that will be made into a
film starring Helen Hunt, marveled at the ways of Hollywood. ``I've
got the book half done and we're still negotiating the contract,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the actor Steve Martin ad-libbed before reading from his
new book, ``Pure Drivel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the few events I've ever attended whose title
is a complete sentence,'' he said with a straight face.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Alice Walker who was perhaps the most surprising. Ms.
Walker, the author of ``By the Light of My Father's Smile,'' spoke
seriously about the way her work deals with sexuality and how much
people learn from sexuality. Then she told the crowd: ``Think how
much Clinton is going to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Food for Thought
</P>
<P>
   She has been circulating petitions supporting President Clinton
for months. Now Barbara Layton, a restaurateur in East Hampton,
N.Y., has declared Oct. 2 Stop Impeachment Now Day. ``We will have
phones available for people to come in and call their
representatives,'' she said. ``I'll have scripted messages for
them.''

BUILDER ADMITS GUILT IN DEATH OF GIRL, 16 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOSPEH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Bronx construction company pleaded guilty Monday to
manslaughter and will pay a $10,000 fine in the death of a
16-year-old girl who was injured last January when a brick fell
from the roof of a Brooklyn elementary school that was undergoing
repairs.
</P>
<P>
   A supervisor at the company, Espo Construction Inc., also
pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of failing to provide
overhead protection at the school, Public School 131 in Borough
Park, even after the city's School Construction Authority notified
him that the protection from falling debris was required for the
project, which involved roof and masonry repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Although the misdemeanor charge is punishable by up to a year in
jail, the site supervisor, Kevin Cunningham, 27, of the Bronx, is
to be sentenced to three years' probation under the plea deal, in
which the Brooklyn district attorney's office has also agreed to
drop charges of second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent
homicide that have been brought against him.
</P>
<P>
   The girl, Yan Zhen Zhao, suffered a fractured skull when she was
hit on Jan. 9 outside P.S. 131 by one of the bricks that
prosecutors said was being used to secure a tarpaulin on the roof.
Her death angered parents of students at the school, who said they
had complained to school officials about unsafe conditions at the
construction project.
</P>
<P>
   The death also caused building officials to inspect renovation
projects at nearly 200 schools and to halt work at nine sites found
to have insufficient or nonexistent protection from falling debris.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such steps, in another incident last March, a
100-foot-long brick parapet being renovated at another Brooklyn
school, P.S. 194 in Sheepshead Bay, collapsed inward onto the
school's roof, injuring a construction worker as well as two
students who were inside the building. P.S. 194 had not been one of
the nine schools found to have inadequate protection.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's plea agreement, a lawyer for Espo told Acting
Justice Alan Marrus of state supreme court, who presided at the
session, that the company's plea was ``contingent on resolution''
of additional charges that the prosecutor's office had brought
against Espo unrelated to the death of Ms. Zhao.
</P>
<P>
   Marrus said that if the other charges were not settled in a plea
agreement, he would allow the company to withdraw its plea in the
girl's death and go to trial in that case.
</P>
<P>
   The additional charges accuse the company and two of its
officials, Anthony Esposito, the treasurer, and Bernardino
Esposito, a vice president, of grand larceny and violating state
labor law by paying some workers less than the required prevailing
wages for construction work on public projects.
</P>
<P>
   Later, aides to the Brooklyn district attorney, Charles J.
Hynes, confirmed that negotiations were under way toward a plea
agreement on the wage-related charges and expressed confidence that
such an agreement would be reached.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Hynes said that Espo had admitted to the most
serious charge it faced, second-degree manslaughter, which had
accused the company of recklessly engaging in conduct that caused
Ms. Zhao's death. The $10,000 fine, said the spokesman, Patrick
Clark, was the highest possible for the charge.
</P>
<P>
   As for the misdemeanor and probation deal with Cunningham,
Espo's site supervisor at the P.S. 131 project, Clark said his
office had agreed to it ``because of the certainty of a guilty
plea'' and because it enables Ms. Zhao's family ``to avoid the
trauma of a trial.'' He said that the family, which has filed a
civil suit against the company and the School Construction
Authority, ``fully supported'' the plea deal in the criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zhao, a Borough Park resident who attended John Dewey High
School in Brooklyn, had gone to P.S. 131 with a friend to meet the
friend's younger sister when she was hit by the brick. She died
several days later without regaining consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for Espo, Joseph R. Famighetti, said the company had
pled guilty to the manslaughter charge ``because it was felt that
going to trial in this case was not in its best interest.''

NORSTROM PAIRS WITH BLAKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif._ The Los Angeles Kings had just been
eliminated from the Stanley Cup playoffs in late April, and now,
Mattias Norstrom was competing for his homeland and trying to win a
world championship for Sweden before settling down for a quiet
summer after the long National Hockey League season.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the slash by an unknown Swiss player to the side of
his left knee _ a whack that by hockey standards was not much more
than a love tap _ and just like that, the start of Norstrom's
summer was plunged into chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it right away,'' Norstrom recalled recently. ``I felt a
burn. Then, I felt no pain at all. At the next whistle, I went out
on the ice to skate, and I fell down. It was just a freak incident.
He hit me in a bad spot, with no padding.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst was yet to come for the 26-year-old Norstrom, Rob
Blake's defensive partner and the unsung contributor to Blake's
Norris Trophy-winning play last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tough thing for me,'' Norstrom said, ``was that at first,
the doctor said I'd be out six to nine months.''
</P>
<P>
   The possibility even was broached to Norstrom that his career
might be over because of the injury _ a bruise to the peroneal
nerve commonly referred to as ``foot drop.'' But there Norstrom was
two weeks ago to greet his defense partner when Blake arrived at
training camp after missing the first five days resolving a
contract dispute with the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he suffered that injury, it looked like it was a little
more serious than it turned out to be,'' Blake said. ``I was
telling my wife a couple of days ago, I'm pretty lucky to walk into
training camp and get thrown right back with Matti and not even
miss a beat.''
</P>
<P>
   The scariest part of the injury was that recovery, to a great
extent, was out of Norstrom's control. The mixture of ability and
disability was confusing, too.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, he didn't need crutches, was able to ride a
stationary bicycle within three days of the slash, could do squats,
could stand on his toes and didn't feel pain.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he couldn't move his foot up and down,
couldn't run, and couldn't feel much of anything. There's no cure
for foot drop other than the passage of time, and no one could say
how much time it would take.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing you can do to make the nerve healthier,'' team
physician Dr. Ronald Kvitne said. ``You can't give it medication to
make the nerve recover. ... It's like a head injury, where it can
take a Paul Kariya months to recover. It's a nervous-system injury.
We were waiting for the dust to settle. We never see foot drop in
hockey. It happens usually in bad injuries, dislocations, in car
accidents. Sometimes the nerve doesn't come back. Anything can
happen. It's such a rare thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Norstrom, the nerve healed itself sooner rather
than later. On Aug. 1, about two months after the slash, Norstrom
began skating in his native Sweden with several other NHL players,
among them countryman Mats Sundin of the Toronto Maple Leafs.
</P>
<P>
   Norstrom has been at full strength since before the Kings began
training camp on Sept. 12. He has full function in his leg, he
said, though the top of his foot has yet to regain the sensations
of hot and cold.
</P>
<P>
   But that deficiency _ expected to be temporary _ is small
compared to what might have been lost. In 1996, when the Kings were
breaking up their old team and building their new one, Norstrom was
the player they held out for in a multi-player trade with the New
York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of months into last season, Kings coach Larry Robinson
paired the 6-foot-2, 201-pound Norstrom with the 6-3, 222-pound
Blake, and the combination instantly clicked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You watch him in the corner,'' Blake said. ``He can go in with
two guys a lot bigger than him and somehow he'll come out with the
puck, make that one play that sets the winger or me away. It's kind
of a tough job because not a lot of people realize it. They see him
playing 30 minutes a game but they don't realize how valuable he
is.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys in here, they recognize how tough a player he is.
When he goes in the corner, he goes to get the puck, no matter
what. I think your greatest compliment is what other people say and
obviously they talk a lot about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said, ``He's a great person and probably our
best-conditioned athlete. He does a lot of things well. He just has
never been given a chance to show what he can do. Sometimes he
makes bonehead plays, but it's not from lack of trying. Sometimes,
he's trying to do too damn much. Whenever he just plays a nice,
basic, easy game, he's a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   If Norstrom has one glaring area for improvement, it's his
inoffensive statistics. He scored just one goal last season, and
has only four in 207 NHL games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely something I look to add to my game,'' said
Norstrom, who is scheduled to earn $950,000 this season. ``It's the
next step I have to take to be a two-way player.''
</P>
<P>
   If he is successful, the Kings have even more to look forward to
from the soft-spoken, English-fluent Norstrom, who is looking to
buy a house in the Manhattan Beach area with his wife, Kristin, and
their West Highland terrier, Minnie. Stockholm, where he was born,
has its pluses, but winter sunshine isn't one of them, and Norstrom
would like to stick around Los Angeles for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the cold,'' Norstrom said of the Swedish winters.
``It's the dark. The sun comes up at 9:30 or 10 in the morning. It
goes back down at 2:30 or 3. For a lot of people, it's dark when
they go to work, dark when they come home. It's kind of
depressing.''

   Swedish summers, on the other hand, are much brighter, unless
you have foot drop and are fearing for your career. As far as
Norstrom is concerned, though, the timing of his frightening injury
_ five months before the start of a new NHL season _ was a
blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best time, exactly,'' he said. ``That's the way I
looked at it. It was an honor to play for my country, and they won
the gold medal at the World Championships. But that was the best
time for it to happen. My priority is doing well with the Kings in
the NHL.''

 &HT;    Shelter left with little to offer its occupants
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAUTIER, Miss. _ Cut off from help by severe flooding, with no
phones or lights, no water to flush toilets and no food to spare,
Edwina Grimsely was doing the best she could Monday to take care of
the 400 evacuees inside a shelter with part of the roof missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel helpless, exhausted, just pure exhausted,'' Grimsley
said at noontime Monday as she juggled problems in the sticky,
smelly darkness of the temporary shelter at Mississippi Gulf Coast
Community College. ``We cannot meet the peoples' needs.''
</P>
<P>
   With power lines down and roads flooded by Hurricane Georges, no
immediate relief for the evacuees, many of them elderly, was
coming. Grimsley, 60, an American Red Cross volunteer who, along
with her husband, Nate, 66, was managing the shelter, said angrily,
``Surely the governor can send some help down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in the daylight hours, the hallways were dark and dank,
with candles lighting classrooms crowded with people trying to
sleep. Others tried to rest sitting in chairs in the hallways where
the rain was leaking through holes in the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the elderly needed medical attention. Around noon, a
woman rushed to Grimsely and said an old woman ``is just drooping
over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Get the EMT,'' Grimsley shouted.
</P>
<P>
   The ordeal for the evacuees began shortly after midnight Monday.
People were trying to sleep when rain started leaking through the
roof of the college's gymansium. People nervously pointed
flashlights at the ceiling when the wind roared like a train across
the roof. The roof began to strain, and a skylight blew off.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that the roof might collapse, relief workers ordered
people to move away from the center of the gym. They huddled along
the walls and then sought refuge in the locker rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Another skylight blew away, and then the wind ripped off a
section of the roof. ``It was raining hard, like we were outside,''
said Julio Navas, 41, worried about the safety of his wife, four
children, two grandchildren and his nephew.
</P>
<P>
   At the peak of Georges' furious winds and slashing rain, Red
Cross workers were forced to relocate the evacuees from the gym to
a classroom building across a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   The wind was blowing so hard it broke out car windows and
uprooted trees on the college campus.
</P>
<P>
   The sick, the elderly, the women and children were transported
first, traveling in groups of five in an ambulance. The move across
the parking lot took nearly three hours. When it was over, water
was ankle-deep in the gym, and the blankets, clothes and food that
people were forced to leave behind were sopping.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Miller, a 36-year-old plumber, stayed behind to help
sort through the mess. Workers tried to salvage food from paper
bags and boxes. They put the food in coolers people had left
behind.
</P>
<P>
   Some protested when sheriff's deputies said that they were
confiscating everybody's food so it could be pooled and distributed
evenly among the group, including some who had arrived with nothing
to eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is breakfast and lunch,'' Edwina Grimsley said Monday as
she ate ham and cheese on white bread. ``There will be no supper
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley, who had cut short her vacation to help at the shelter,
was relaxing for a moment, propping a foot against the desk of a
college vice president whose smiling family pictures on the wall
behind looked odd in the flickering light.
</P>
<P>
   People slept on sofas and chairs in the nicely furnished office.
It was unofficially the shelter's headquarters and complaint
center.
</P>
<P>
   A woman walked in with two plastic milk jugs with the tops cut
off. She had collected rain water in them, and she wanted to pour
it in the toilet so that it could be flushed.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly two Gautier policemen rushed in and shined flashlights
at Grimsley. People were leaving the shelter, and the officers
wanted to know whether anybody in charge had told them it was safe
to return home.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated, Grimsley said she had not. ``Lock them up. Take them
to jail,'' she said. ``I can't control them.''

EDITORIAL: THE RUSTLE OF MIDEAST DIPLOMACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Sept. 29:
</P>
<P>
   After more than a year of slumber, the Middle East peace effort
is stirring. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat,
the Palestinian leader, are talking with one another again, and on
Monday President Clinton invited them to Washington next month for
intensive talks to complete a long-stalled round of negotiations
with his assistance. With time rapidly running out on the
negotiating clock established under the Oslo accords, the two sides
can afford no further delay.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Palestinian terrorism and Israeli intransigence, the
Oslo timetable calling for completion of a comprehensive peace
agreement by May 1999 has been all but obliterated. By now Israel
and the Palestinians should have been far along in the final-status
talks about such difficult issues as the shape and status of a
Palestinian state and the future of Jerusalem. Instead they are
still arguing over the terms of the next partial Israeli withdrawal
from the West Bank, an issue that was supposed to be resolved more
than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's White House meeting between Netanyahu, Arafat and
Clinton was an encouraging sign that the obstacles are diminishing,
even if the Middle East leaders stood glumly at Clinton's side
during a brief encounter with reporters. The two men now agree in
principle on an American proposal for Israel to pull its military
forces back from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank,
including a 3 percent piece that would be classified as a nature
preserve to prevent Palestinian settlement. The Palestinians
already control 27 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Because the withdrawal is entangled with other issues, including
security guarantees for Israel, Washington has proposed other steps
that need to be settled before final-status talks can commence. The
Palestinians, for instance, must commit themselves to enforce an
ambitious plan to combat terrorism. It would be helpful if both
parties refrained from provocative statements or decisions. In
particular, Arafat ought to resist the temptation to declare that
come May he will establish a Palestinian state, whether or not
negotiations are completed. Happily, he showed such restraint on
Monday in a speech to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would no doubt like to give negotiations a nudge not
only to help produce a lasting peace in the Middle East but also to
fortify his troubled presidency. Guiding Netanyahu and Arafat
toward agreement just days before the midterm election might
achieve both objectives.

 &HT;    Polish grave may shed clues on famous count
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A delegation from Savannah has collected teeth and
bits of bone from a grave in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   The group returned to the United States with the remains over
the weekend. Now they hope to analyze the DNA from the Polish body
parts and compare it with the DNA in bones buried under a Savannah
monument. The comparison will help determine whether the Savannah
remains are those of Count Casimir Pulaski, a Revolutionary War
hero who died in the Battle of Savannah in 1779.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Powell, a member of Savannah's Pulaski Committee, said
Monday that results from the comparison should be in by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Bones believed to be those of the famous Polish count were taken
out of Savannah's Pulaski Monument in 1996 when the 55-foot obelisk
began falling apart. They had been buried under the monument in
1854.
</P>
<P>
   DNA from those bones was extracted months ago. With luck, Powell
said, the Savannah bones will be reinterred when the city re-erects
the Pulaski Monument next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Polish remains are those of Teressa Witkowska, a
great-grandniece of Pulaski's. They will be examined by the lab in
New Jersey that found DNA in the bones from the Savannah monument.
</P>
<P>
   Powell said Witkowska's remains were in poor shape. The woman
died in 1861.
</P>
<P>
   A number of artifacts were found in the tomb, including a rosary
and crucifix and several lockets. Everything was examined,
photographed, and put back in the tomb, and a Roman Catholic priest
performed required exhumation rites.
</P>
<P>
   The Pulaski detective work made big news in the count's native
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowds were tremendous. He's a hero in America, but more
of one in Poland,'' Powell said. ``We were on the front page of the
six national papers for two days, and on all the television network
news shows.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhumation occurred in the town of Promna, near Warka, the
ancestral home of the Pulaski family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made sure everything was done in a respectful manner,''
Powell said. ``The headstone will be put back up. Lots of people
were watching all the time.

FED SEEN LIKELY TO CUT RATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Federal Reserve appears ready to cut interest
rates Tuesday in a move designed to ward off global economic
troubles and buoy shaky US financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   A rate cut, if it comes, will be the first by the central bank
in almost three years, and will occur at a time when by most
conventional measures the economy is in little need of lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the Fed is still likely to act because of mounting
worries that the 14-month-old global crisis has finally begun
hurting the US economy and, perhaps as importantly, that a group of
big-betting speculators, which includes hedge fund Long-Term
Capital Management LP, have gotten themselves in such trouble that
they could damage US markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real economy does not require a rate cut, period,'' said
Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting center at
Georgia State University. ``This is all about helping these hedge
funds liquidate their positions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The only debate among most Fed watchers Monday was over how
large a rate cut to expect. Most observers predicted the central
bank will trim the federal funds rate, the rate at which banks make
short-term loans to each other, by one-quarter of a percentage
point, altgough a few said the cut could be as large as one-half a
percentage point. Several also speculated that a cut might also
involve the discount rate, the rate at which banks can borrow from
the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever prediction turns out to be right, the central bank's
move will have only a modest, immediate effect on market interest
rates, and will serve mainly as a symbolic gesture. &UR;  &LR; ``The Fed will
be signalling that it intends to prevent the global economy from
falling into recession,'' said Wiliam Dudley, a senior US economist
with Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's policy making Federal Open Market Committee has
maintained the federal funds rate at 5.50 percent since March,
1997. The discount rate is 5.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For ordinary Americans, the Fed's about-face on the US economy's
condition has been nothing short of dizzying. Only last summer,
Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan was telling Congress that
the economy's preformance was ``as impressive as any I have
witnessed'' in a half century, and suggesting that if the central
bank did anything, it might raise rates to fend off renewed
inflation. As recently as the beginning of this month, Greenspan
was saying that the Fed was as likely as not to leave rates
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   As if that weren't confusing enough, analysts said the economy
is still doing well by most standard measures, with consumer
spending and confidence continuing to ride high while unemployment
remains at near-record lows.
</P>
<P>
   But a string of events in the last month have shaken policy
makers' conviction the United States can escape the global upheaval
unscathed. Russia devalued its currency and defaulted on a
substantial fraction of its debt. Brazil and other Latin American
countries, experienced a run on their finacial markets. And here,
regulators orchestrated a privately financed rescue package for
Long-Term Capital in a move that many saw as a sign of worry about
US financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's almost a total disconnect between current conditions
and what everybody expects, or worries, will happen,'' said Mark M.
Zandi, chief economist of Regional Financial Asociates in West
Chester, Pa. ``I can't remember a time when the gap was wider, and
people's assessment changed so fast,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zandi and others said that if, as expected, the Fed approves an
interest rate cut, it will be entering largely uncharted waters.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank has generally made preemptive policy moves,
such as a rate cut, when it was worried about inflation, not an
economic slowdown. It has almost always acted to help only the US
economy, but in this case will be seeking to help the global
economy as well.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, for much of the current boom, Greenspan has sought
to temper enthusiasm for the stock market with warnings about
``overexuberance,'' something that analysts said a rate cut could
re-ignite.

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Iraq will not withdraw its ban on spot arms
inspections, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said on Monday after
a meeting with Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is seeking a comprehensive review of its relations with the
United Nations. Aziz was apparently told at the meeting that Iraq
must rescind the ban before any broad review is undertaken.
</P>
<P>
   The ban has already led the Security Council to suspend its
regular reviews of the economic sanctions it has maintained against
Iraq since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   After the hourlong meeting, the deputy prime minister repeated
that Iraq had already complied with Security Council resolutions
and that the sanctions should be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Therefore the idea that Iraq should do this or that concession
before the comprehensive review takes place is not legal and not
logical,'' a visibly annoyed Aziz told reporters. He is expected to
meet with Security Council members during the week and return for
another session with Annan on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging over these talks is an Iraqi threat to stop all
cooperation with the inspectors. That would effectively shut down
the most ambitious arms monitoring system ever established in a
country that had violated international law.
</P>
<P>
   About 125 inspectors and staff members are still in Iraq, backed
by a sophisticated array of soil, air and water samplers as well as
on-site video cameras and surveillance aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis, implacable foes of Israel, found some propaganda
mileage Monday in an interview that Scott Ritter, a former American
arms inspector whose specialty is detecting concealment, gave to
the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. In that interview, Ritter was quoted
as saying he had been working closely with the Israelis while he
was a U.N. arms inspector.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter was reported to have said he could not have done his job
without Israeli help, since the CIA had not been cooperative. He
accused the CIA of provoking an examination by the FBI of whether
he had given sensitive information to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Special Commission say it is normal for member
countries of the United Nations to assist the weapons inspection
program. Israel, which bombed the Osirak nuclear reactor in Iraq in
1981, is known to have watched Iraq carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Iraq's ban on spot inspections, on Sept. 9 the
Security Council froze all future reviews of the sanctions imposed
after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. Until those reviews
resume, sanctions cannot be lifted. The regular reviews are
separate from the comprehensive review that the Iraqis are seeking.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks the Iraqis have been trying to move the issue
away from the Security Council to the secretary general's office,
building on an agreement they struck with Annan in February, when
he went to Baghdad to defuse a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But diplomats and U.N. officials say the secretary general has
refused to renew his direct involvement and has repeatedly sent the
message to Baghdad that there can be no circumventing of Security
Council resolutions and that spot inspections must resume.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors from the United Nations Special Commission, which
looks for biological and chemical weapons and prohibited missile
systems, and the International Atomic Energy Agency, which watches
nuclear developments, say inspections are vital to the monitoring
system.
</P>
<P>
   Even after sanctions are lifted, the Security Council intends to
keep the long-term surveillance in place, but inspectors say that
to make that work, they must follow up with site visits when
suspicious new information emerges from the monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   Because Iraq continues to block inspections, the Security
Council has made little effort to define exactly what a
comprehensive review of sanctions would entail.
</P>
<P>
   Suggestions range from a study of the ways that Iraqis have
suffered under the embargo to a renewed look at Iraqi failures to
account for missing Kuwaitis or to return property stolen during
the Persian Gulf war, a review the United States insists on.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Americans who oppose an indefinite embargo against Iraq may soon
find a new public ally in Denis Halliday, who until this week
directed the ``oil for food'' program in Baghdad that allowed the
Iraqis to sell limited amounts of oil to buy civilian goods.
</P>
<P>
   Although Halliday, an Irish expert on development, was able to
broaden considerably the aid Iraqis received, he became an opponent
of sanctions during his tenure in Baghdad. He not only resigned his
position there but also left the United Nations, and he is being
sought as a speaker and for congressional testimony, diplomats said
here.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the United Nations announced the name of his
replacement, Hans von Sponeck of Germany, a former official of the
United Nations Development Program.

DEFENSE SELDOM WINS IF SUSPECT HANDLES IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The murder trial of James Allen Gordon just under way
in a third-floor courtroom in Queens looks much like any other
criminal case. Two court-appointed lawyers, Chris Renfroe and
Russell Morea, interrogate a parade of potential jurors. The
defendant, unshackled each morning as he is brought into the
courtroom, sits quietly off to one side, occasionally scribbling
notes on a yellow legal pad.
</P>
<P>
   But this case is unlike any other in the state. Gordon, a
10th-grade dropout, is the first defendant to represent himself in
a death penalty case since capital punishment was reinstated in New
York three years ago. He is accused of murdering three women two
years ago in Jamaica, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Thomas Demakos of state Supreme Court has allowed Gordon
to retain his court-appointed lawyers as advisers, and so far,
Gordon, 26, has let them handle the delicate job of jury selection.
He has already dismissed lawyers furnished by the State Capital
Defender's Office, an agency created by the Legislature to ensure
adequate representation in capital cases. Gordon has not specified
his reasons for seeking to represent himself, saying simply, ``I'm
the one who is sitting in this chair.''
</P>
<P>
   But in representing himself, Gordon has now joined a small group
of defendants in capital cases nationwide who have taken their
fates into their own hands _ with mostly unsuccessful results.
</P>
<P>
   His predecessors include Pernell Ford, an Alabama man who,
according to the lawyers handling his appeal, told jurors that God
would resurrect the man he was accused of killing; Kenneth Dwayne
Dunn, who a psychiatrist said was having delusions of becoming a
lawyer or a king, and Willie Louis Russaw, who barely uttered a
word during his trial in Alabama, which, lawyers who represented
him in a later trial said, lasted less than two days.
</P>
<P>
   They were all convicted and sentenced to death. Only Russaw's
conviction was overturned.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that a defendant has the
constitutional right to represent himself in court _ a right that
can be denied only if the courts deem the person mentally
incompetent. Still, most defense lawyers shudder at the prospect of
self-representation in a death penalty trial, arguing that it
creates an unequal playing field and threatens to make a circus out
of the criminal justice system. Prosecutors who have tried pro se
cases, as these trials are called, say they are often forced to
respond to frivolous requests and delaying tactics. Almost
unequivocally, lawyers on both sides agree that such a defense does
not bode well for the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juries tend to resent a great deal people who represent
themselves, but people who are accused of violent felonies in
particular,'' said Bryan Stevenson, executive director of the Equal
Justice Initiative of Alabama, a nonprofit group that handles
appeals for death row inmates. ``The experience has not been
encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   While jurors often can be won over by an amiable defense lawyer,
said Bob Morrow, a former deputy attorney general with the Alabama
attorney general's office, ``defendants who are defending
themselves don't realize how mad they make the jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judges usually bend over backwards to give them a lot of
leeway,'' he said, ``so it's not pleasant for prosecutors to go
through.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Queens, Demakos has permitted Gordon to ask his
court-appointed lawyers to take over any part of the proceedings _
so long as he does not interrupt them midway. Since the start of
jury selection last Wednesday, he appears to have heeded the
advice.
</P>
<P>
   He will also face a survivor of the July 1996 attack and
triple-murder that he is accused of committing. Prosecutors have
said that Gordon went to the home of his victims to collect a drug
debt. According to the authorities, he raped one woman and fatally
shot her in the head before shooting and killing two others and
bludgeoning a fourth with a hammer. The fourth woman, Zakkiyah
Holliman, and another woman, who escaped by jumping out of a
window, are expected to testify.
</P>
<P>
   The case presents a peculiar challenge for the Queens District
Attorney, Richard Brown, who opposes capital punishment. Brown said
he chose this as his first death penalty case in part because of
the ``deliberate, vicious and callous'' nature of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Death penalty cases are among the most complicated and
lengthiest proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   In Gordon's case, with the defendant representing himself, Brown
said, the trial may run longer and prove more difficult for the
prosecution, because the judge may have to make special
accommodations to protect Gordon's rights. ``Pro se defendants are
generally difficult defendants,'' he said. ``They don't fully
understand the ramifications of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, defense lawyers around the country have
regarded self-representation as a self-destructive choice. One
exception is Michael Tigar, the former lawyer for Terry Nichols,
who could have faced the death penalty but was sentenced to life in
prison for conspiring to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building
in Oklahoma City. Tigar, now a law professor at American
University, said that sometimes a defendant can ``humanize the
process'' _ for instance, by making an opening statement _
particularly if an experienced lawyer can handle other aspects of
the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Tigar pointed out that one of his clients, Angela Davis, acted
as co-counsel in her trial on charges of planning a courthouse
shooting. The trial began as a capital case and ended with
acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, other lawyers experienced in capital cases say that
although convictions in pro se cases are often easily won, they are
not reliable and thus open to challenge on appeal. ``It's going to
be a very fragile victory,'' George Kendall, a staff lawyer with
the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, said. ``Courts later on are going to
look very differently at this case from cases where there were
lawyers on both sides trying their hearts out.''
</P>
<P>
   The murder conviction of Russaw, who represented himself in his
1989 death penalty trial, did turn out to be fragile. Russaw fired
his court-appointed lawyer, contending he had made racist remarks.
When the court denied him another lawyer, he represented himself.
In effect, however, he refused to participate in his trial,
declining to select jurors, cross-examine witnesses, or even make
an opening statement.
</P>
<P>
   His conviction was overturned in 1990 on the grounds that the
court had not properly instructed jurors that they could have
convicted him of a lesser charge. Stevenson of the Equal Justice
Initiative represented Russaw at a second trial in 1991 at which
the defendant avoided the death penalty and received life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The right to represent oneself has emerged as an issue in recent
trials, most famously in the federal capital case of the Unabomber,
Theodore Kaczynski, who tried to fire his lawyers earlier this year
when they wanted to present a mental illness defense. The judge
denied his request, saying that it came too late in the trial.
Within weeks, Kaczynski, who was found to be a paranoid
schizophrenic but was declared competent to stand trial, pleaded
guilty and was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.
</P>
<P>
   Courts have little discretion in denying a defendant's right to
represent himself.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Gordon case has drawn fresh attention to the issue of
evaluating competence, with many defense lawyers arguing that any
such request in a capital case ought to set off alarm bells.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the judge nor the two sets of defense lawyers who
represented Gordon requested a psychological evaluation. ``He
certainly clearly understands the nature of these proceedings,''
Morea said.
</P>
<P>
   As in the federal case of Kaczynski, state courts have ruled
that mental illness does not necessarily render a defendant
incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, for instance, a court-ordered psychiatric evaluation
found Dunn to have been delusional, harboring fantasies of becoming
a psychiatrist, lawyer or king but competent to represent himself
nonetheless, said Jim Marcus, the director of the Texas Defender
Service, who interviewed jurors after the 1988 trial. The jury
reached a verdict in six minutes. Since then, Dunn, sentenced to
death for killing a bank teller during a robbery, has been on death
row pending his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gordon, Walter Leroy Moody in Alabama was also found to
competent to represent himself in his trial in the 1989 letter-bomb
killing of a Birmingham judge, though no psychological evaluations
were ordered. Moody had fired his lawyers, saying one was an
informer for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the other was
a bigamist. In jury selection, he accused prosecutors of being
child molesters. He was convicted in 1996. The case is now under
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Although it came before the reinstatement of capital punishment
in New York in 1995, the trial of Colin Ferguson, the man convicted
of killing six commuters on the Long Island Rail Road in 1993, was
the most widely publicized recent case in New York of a defendant
representing himself.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson, diagnosed as paranoid, badly disputed eyewitness
testimony and said his gun was stolen by the real murderer after he
had fallen asleep on the train. He was convicted in the spring of
1995 and sentenced him to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the Gordon trial, lawyers around the country
frequently referred to Ferguson's case, which has come to epitomize
the perils of self-representation. The difference is that Gordon
faces the death penalty.

 &HT;    State Supreme Court hears case of North Texas mayor's ouster
 &HT;    By Osler McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ In a historic appearance at Baylor University, the
Texas Supreme Court grappled Monday with constitutional limits on
the power of a city council to oust a mayor in a case that might
have left J.R. Ewing green with envy.
</P>
<P>
   The case _ challenging how the Westlake Board of Aldermen tried
the Fort Worth suburb's mayor for misconduct last year _ questioned
the fairness of the mayor's dismissal when two aldermen testified
against the mayor in the trial, then acted as judge and jury to
convict him.
</P>
<P>
   A decision by the court could have far-reaching implications for
smaller Texas cities in their procedures to get rid of bad-acting
officeholders.
</P>
<P>
   The court heard the Westlake case and two others in its first
regular session outside Austin in more than 100 years. Voters
approved a constitutional amendment last year that gave the court
discretion elsewhere in the state. The Baylor Law School was first
to seek the court's appearance.
</P>
<P>
   In the Westlake case, four of five aldermen threw out the mayor
after he blocked an effort to disannex a large ranch owned by
developer Ross Perot Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Perot's property _ the largest undeveloped area west of the
Dallas-Fort Worth airport _ had been at the center of a continuing
dispute over Westlake's development restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Perot planned a $3 billion development on the ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the aldermen owned land in the area removed from the
city's boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   In their questions to lawyers on both sides of the case, the
justices demonstrated their concern over how much due process
should be provided when council members initiate an impeachment
proceeding with a complaint and finish it with a judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you have a fair tribunal when your judges are fact
witnesses against you?'' Justice Nathan Hecht at one point asked
Dee Kelly Jr., the Fort Worth attorney defending the proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly argued that the proceeding against the mayor, Scott
Bradley, met due process requirements. The law did not require a
judicial trial's protracted review process, he said, because a
local council needed to act against an officeholder convicted of
misconduct and get on with governing.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas attorney Eldridge Goins Jr., representing Bradley, said
the ousted mayor had been denied due process by lack of effective
review of the aldermen's decision as well as failure to overcome
bias the aldermen showed.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley sued over his ouster, claiming that the three aldermen
and the mayor they appointed to take his place all owned property
in the area they voted to disannex and stood to benefit from their
decision. Also included in the area they voted to remove from
Westlake's boundaries was a business complex that provided almost
all of the city's revenues.
</P>
<P>
   In the days after the aldermen's decisions against Bradley and
for disannexation in late April and early May 1997, two new
aldermen were elected who supported Bradley. They voted to grant
him a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing turmoil Westlake filed for bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   A trial judge had ruled in Bradley's favor, but the Texas Court
of Appeals in Fort Worth overturned that decision.
</P>
<P>
   One first-year Baylor law student who watched the court, Debi
Hood of Terrell, said she found the argument easier to follow than
she had expected, but was surprised at how the justices kept
interrupting the lawyers as they argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't get a chance to get through their whole
argument,'' Hood said.
</P>
<P>
   Osler McCarthy writes for the Austin American-Statesman, Austin,
Texas.

STALLED STORM DUMPS DELUGE ON GULF COAST 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By TONY FREEMANTLE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BILOXI, Miss. _ Hurricane Georges slowed to a crawl after
lurching ashore before dawn Monday, swamping the central Gulf Coast
with hours of heavy rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   The Category 2 hurricane, which killed hundreds of people last
week and cut a broad path of destruction as it roared through the
Caribbean and into the Gulf of Mexico, lost much of its punch as it
made landfall between Biloxi and Pascagoula, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   But, while initial damage appeared relatively light (despite a
wind gust of 172 mph recorded at Kessler Air Force Base), the
primary concern was the stall almost immediately after striking the
coast with 110-mph winds. By early evening Georges, downgraded to a
tropical storm, was sitting almost stationary about 20 miles to the
north of Biloxi, and the National Hurricane Center did not expect
it to move much.
</P>
<P>
   Already the storm had dropped an estimated 23-25 inches of rain,
with the highest amounts falling on the Alabama and Florida
Panhandle coasts. Forecasters predicted that these areas could
receive an additional 15-20 inches of rain. Flash-flood watches
were issued for much of Mississippi and Alabama through today.
Parts of Florida also were under flood watches.
</P>
<P>
   Access roads to Pascagoula were severed by rising waters by
early Monday afternoon; apartment complexes and homes were flooded
in Gulfport, Miss.; and streets in downtown Mobile, Ala, were
flooded with up to four feet of water when high winds and a storm
surge pushed Mobile Bay out of its banks.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton on Monday declared major disasters or
emergencies in Florida, Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi and
freed federal funds to aid cleanup efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency-operations officials up and down the coast expressed
relief that, unlike its rampage through the Caribbean, where it
killed at least 372 people, Georges had taken relatively few lives.
</P>
<P>
   Two storm-related deaths were reported in Louisiana _ an elderly
woman who died of natural causes while being evacuated from a
nursing home, and a man who died in a fire apparently set by
candles he was using during a power outage _ and one in Florida,
where a 66-year-old Pensacola woman also died in a fire set by
candles.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, officials attributed the light death toll to
quick evacuation orders, which were mostly followed. In New
Orleans, which was spared a devastating direct hit by Georges when
the storm tracked north late Sunday, upward of 1.5 million people
were urged to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot stress enough how important the evacuation was to the
fact that we have not lost a life yet in Gulfport,'' Mayor Bob
Short said. ``People took our advice and left. Now what we want
them to do is stay put until we think it is safe for them to
return.''
</P>
<P>
   As many as 500,000 people from Louisiana to Florida were left
without power by the hurricane, whose sustained winds were up to
105 mph when it made landfall, but which rapidly declined as the
storm weakened over land.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, residents of the August Moon Apartments in
Gulfport were wading through waist-deep water in their homes trying
to save what they could.
</P>
<P>
   Robyn Clark, a mechanic at the Navy facility in Gulfport, had
arrived back to her apartment after a vacation in Texas, not
thinking that Georges was much of a threat.
</P>
<P>
   But at about 3 a.m. Monday the sound of the storm roaring ashore
changed her mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It woke me up, and I swear it sounded just like the `Wizard of
Oz,''' she said. ``I couldn't stop thinking about how that's how it
sounded. I looked out in the parking lot and everything seemed to
be OK, so I went back to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   When she next looked out, cars were up to their windows with
water, and it was coming into her apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really scared,'' she said. ``Things like this don't
really scare me. I just felt real lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   Another resident, Rosie Lewis, spent most of the morning trying
to rescue her three young grandchildren from their apartment,
complaining all the while that she couldn't get any help from the
National Guard or the Biloxi police.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called them, and they said there was nothing they could
do,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   In New Orleans, the sigh of relief that the city had escaped a
direct hit turned into the grumblings of frustration as the day
wore on and city officials would not allow people to leave
evacuation shelters, including about 10,000 people who had sought
refuge in the Superdome. They were finally allowed to leave in the
evening.
</P>
<P>
   It was only at 6 p.m. that officials decided to reopen the
interstates that had been closed in the city since noon Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Damage from Georges included downed power lines, snapped tree
limbs, uprooted trees and minor structural damage. Among the more
severe cases of damage reported were in Gautier, Miss., where roof
damage forced 404 storm refugees out of a shelter, and Pascagoula
where a suspected tornado damaged the roof of another shelter
holding 90 people.

EDITORIAL: A VICTORY FOR CLEANER AIR 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Sept. 29:
</P>
<P>
   After two decades of delay and political debate, the
Environmental Protection Agency has now moved decisively to deal
with windblown pollution that originates mainly in the Midwest and
drifts eastward to poison the air over New York and other
Northeastern states. Last Thursday Carol Browner, the EPA
administrator, ordered 22 states to sharply reduce emissions of
smog-producing nitrogen oxides. Her ruling represents a triumph of
science and common sense over a sustained lobbying campaign by the
Midwestern governors and the coal-fired electric utilities that
will bear most of the cost of the new program.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations call for a 28 percent reduction in emissions
over the entire 22-state area in the next nine years. New York and
New Jersey must undertake modest reductions of 6 and 9 percent
respectively, but more than half the reductions will be extracted
from just six states _ Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan,
Pennsylvania and West Virginia _ each of which will be required to
cut emissions by nearly a third or more.
</P>
<P>
   Although the states are given considerable flexibility in
meeting their individual targets, the main burden will fall on the
big Midwestern utility companies, which produce more than half the
nitrogen oxides that travel downwind to neighboring states and will
now be forced to upgrade existing pollution controls or invest in
newer clean-air technologies. Despite industry complaints that the
rules are unjust and unaffordable, Ms. Browner estimates that the
cost will average about $1.7 billion annually over the next 15
years, which, she says, would raise the average household's
electric utility bill by about $1 a month.
</P>
<P>
   This is a clear victory for public health. Smog not only clouds
the air but aggravates a range of respiratory diseases. One of the
collateral benefits of the new rule will be to bring many areas of
the country into compliance with strict new health standards for
smog announced last year. About 31 million people live in areas
where the rule will clean up the air enough to meet the new
standards.
</P>
<P>
   A bill offered in Congress earlier this year by New York's two
senators, Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Alfonse D'Amato, also seeks
cuts in nitrogen oxide emissions as well as a 50 percent cut in
emissions of sulfur dioxide, the main cause of acid rain.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Browner's action may make the nitrogen oxide section of the
bill less urgent, but the two senators should keep pressing forward
with their efforts to cut sulfur dioxide, which continues to poison
lakes and streams in the Adirondacks and other Northeastern
forests. They can expect another tough political battle, since the
same utilities that produce nitrogen oxides also produce the
chemicals that form acid rain. But Ms. Browner's strong stand
should give them heart.

COMMENTARY: A SUMMER OF VICTORIES AND VIRTUE IN THE BRONX 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This baseball fan's one and only encounter with Joe
DiMaggio is as fresh as an autumn breeze in memory, even after 19
years. Some New York business types were giving the great DiMaggio
an award: a chance, rest assured, for them to bask in his glory and
not the other way around. It was also an opportunity, too good to
miss, for an unabashedly starry-eyed reporter to meet a legend.
</P>
<P>
   By then, a generation or two of New Yorkers knew the aging
Yankee star less for his regal grace on the field than for his role
as a television pitchman for a local bank and a coffee maker. Did
that bother him? he was asked. His response showed why the name
DiMaggio is a synonym for quiet self-assurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a time gap,'' he conceded. ``As I get older, the gap
gets bigger. But when the kids see the commercials, their parents
say to them: `See that man? He once was a ballplayer.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was perfect for the New York Yankees to end their shimmering
summer of glory with a ceremony on Sunday honoring Joe DiMaggio.
Like him, this unbelievable team has brought dignity and elegance
to a chest-thumping city that tends not to be overendowed with
either quality.
</P>
<P>
   Even New Yorkers who do not regularly read the sports pages have
to be standing a little taller because of these Yankees, who begin
the baseball playoffs Tuesday night after winning the most games
ever in their league, 114. This may have been the season of
gladiator heroics by the redoubtable Sammy Sosa and by Mark
McGwire, the late 20th century's answer to Paul Bunyan. But the
1998 Yankees reaffirmed that individual performance is most exalted
when it enhances group achievement and helps make the whole greater
than the sum of its parts.
</P>
<P>
   That holds true for a mighty city as much as for a ball club,
which is why New York could do worse than to study this splendid
team.
</P>
<P>
   In their quarter-century under George Steinbrenner, the Yankees
have made a habit of distinguishing themselves with egocentric
tantrums, uncivil outbursts and all-around loutishness (e.g., Billy
Martin, Reggie Jackson and Steinbrenner himself). But the 1998
edition has been a model of selflessness, exemplified by former
problem children like Darryl Strawberry and Hideki Irabu, who
learned to sublimate personal ambition for the greater good of all.
</P>
<P>
   It is a team of brilliant, determined individuals: Bernie
Williams, David Cone, David Wells, Derek Jeter, Paul O'Neill and a
hard-hitting kid, Shane Spencer, who stepped out of nowhere to make
September a treasure. Come back, Shane. Please.
</P>
<P>
   But no single star shone brighter than the team. No one
pronounced himself more important than the group, not publicly
anyway. Even the domineering team owner kept his boorish side in
admirable check. They were, collectively, something that Yankees
have rarely been: likable. And New Yorkers showed their
appreciation by flocking to Yankee Stadium in record numbers,
although team attendance fell a shade short of the 3 million mark
that Steinbrenner had at one point arbitrarily set as the minimum
required for him to contemplate staying in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Can the magic still fade? Of course.
</P>
<P>
   There are already dyspeptic announcements from the owner that
the astounding 114 victories will mean nothing if the team fails to
win the World Series. Also, the real battles still lie ahead over
where the Yankees will play. Unnecessarily _ and absurdly, some
would add _ Steinbrenner has been allowed to turn the city's budget
and politics upside down, pretty much assuring that his quest for a
Manhattan stadium will dominate municipal life for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Yet none of that can dull the luster of this remarkable summer.
Even if, Heaven forbid, they get knocked out of the playoffs by the
Texas Rangers this week, the Yankees have shown New York the
meaning of self-confidence and courtliness, words that bring to
mind another Joe DiMaggio story, this one from writer Gay Talese.
After DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe were married in 1954, they
honeymooned in Tokyo, where an American general asked if she would
take time out to visit the troops in Korea. DiMaggio was not
thrilled with the idea, but said, ``Go ahead if you want to.''
</P>
<P>
   When Monroe returned, she said to him: ``It was so wonderful,
Joe. You never heard such cheering.'' DiMaggio replied, ``Yes I
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like the noble Yankees of 1998.

EDITORIAL: STEALTH ASSAULT ON JUVENILE JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Sept. 29:
</P>
<P>
   Republican congressional leaders have been quietly maneuvering
to gain passage for a misguided juvenile crime package. The vehicle
for this mischief is an otherwise uncontroversial measure to renew
funding for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children,
which the Senate approved in June.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month the House also approved the bill, but not
before adding provisions that would permit unprecedented federal
meddling in state juvenile justice systems. Using federal funding
as leverage, these provisions would require states to adopt costly
record-keeping requirements, require the release of juvenile
records in disregard of privacy concerns, and deny judges the
authority to decide which juvenile cases get tried in adult courts.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when juvenile crime is down, and states are moving to
toughen their laws on egregious acts of violence committed by
children, this sort of federal micromanagement of local justice
systems is uncalled for. But rather than return to the original
bill, the House-Senate conference committee is expected to add to
the mess by tacking on portions of the Senate's harsh juvenile
crime bill.
</P>
<P>
   That bill had stalled in the Senate and inspired criticism from
Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who questioned the Senate's
instinct to meddle in juvenile crime issues best left to the
states. Others also objected that the bill would increase the
number of juveniles held in adult prisons, where they would be
vulnerable to sexual assault and far more likely to commit suicide.
Because the bill that emerges from the conference committee will
not be subject to amendment, there is a real chance that Congress
could end up approving major changes in the nation's approach to
juvenile justice and the framework of federalism without any
meaningful floor debate. President Clinton and Senate Democrats
should be ready with blocking maneuvers of their own.

   NEW YORK _ Richie Adams, a former high school, playground and
college basketball star whose repeated declines into drug use and
crime cost him his chances for a professional career, was convicted
on Saturday of killing a 15-year-old girl in a South Bronx housing
project in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, 35, who was convicted of manslaughter but acquitted on a
second-degree murder charge, could be sentenced to life in prison
on Oct. 26 by Acting Justice Gerald Sheindlin of state Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, Norma Rodriguez, a student at Morris High School in
the Bronx, was found beaten and stomped to death on the morning of
Oct. 15, 1996. Her body was in a 15th-floor hallway, one floor
below the apartment of Adams' mother at 3050 Park Ave. in the
Melrose section. Adams turned himself in eight days later and
pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   He had prior convictions for two purse snatchings and holding up
a woman at gunpoint at a bank machine.
</P>
<P>
   After the killing, Miss Rodriguez's family and friends said he
had been stalking her. Numerous imprints on the girl's neck came
from the treads of a pair of size 13 1/2 Adidas hightop sneakers,
an assistant district attorney, William Flack, said after the
trial. The left sneaker, covered with the victim's blood, was found
on the street below the window of his mother's apartment, and
police found the right shoe in his bedroom, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   A witness, Carmen Santos, testified that she saw part of the
attack through the peephole of her front door on the 15th floor of
the building, in the Jackson Houses. Ms. Santos, 49, said she heard
Miss Rodriguez scream, then saw the 6-foot-9-inch Adams grab her by
her bandanna and by the neck. Ms. Santos testified that she ran to
her window then to call for help.
</P>
<P>
   Adams' lawyer, Jerry Vasquez, said the bloody sneaker did not
belong to his client, and introduced evidence that when Adams had
signed up for a basketball tournament two months before the
killing, he had requested size 15 1/2 sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   Adams took the stand during the two-week trial, saying he had
been inside his mother's apartment at the time of the attack,
talking on the phone and sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   The jury of eight men and four women deliberated for three and a
half days before reaching its verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The first-degree manslaughter conviction alone carries a minimum
sentence of 10 years and a maximum of 25 years, Vasquez said. But
Flack, the chief trial lawyer in the Bronx district attorney's
office, said he would ask Sheindlin to declare Adams a persistent
felony offender, a designation that allows a maximum sentence of
life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Adams first tasted fame in 1978, as a standout player on the
top-ranked Benjamin Franklin High School team in East Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   He was a star center from 1981 to 1985 at the University of
Nevada-Las Vegas, where he was twice named conference player of the
year, and finished with 1,168 points and 623 rebounds. In 1985 he
was drafted in the fourth round by the Washington Bullets. But the
next day, he was arrested and charged with stealing a car in the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Adams later brought his game and 250-pound frame to Holcombe
Rucker Memorial Park in Harlem, where he became one of the most
sought-after summer tournament players and was nicknamed ``the
Animal.'' But he also lapsed deeper into drug abuse, friends said.
After his conviction in the purse snatchings and the armed robbery,
he played basketball behind barbed wire in an upstate prison from
1989 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   When he got out of prison, he returned to his mother's apartment
in the Bronx. He was still using drugs, friends and neighbors said,
still unemployed, and stealing again to support his habit. But by
then, his game was deteriorating and his fame had vanished.

MAYOR CALLS BRONX STADIUM PLAN A RERUN 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani scoffed Monday at a proposal
by the Bronx borough president to renovate Yankee Stadium, calling
it a ``warmed over'' version of a plan drawn up for the city four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism came hours after Bronx Borough President Fernando
Ferrer held a news conference at the Bronx Overall Economic
Development Corp. to introduce his proposal, which would modernize
the stadium, add 120 luxury boxes, ease traffic congestion and
redevelop the surrounding neighborhood. While acknowledging that he
had not carefully examined the proposal, Giuliani said it appeared
similar to a plan that the city commissioned in 1994 to dissuade
the Yankees from leaving the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani administration never officially released that plan,
because the Yankees' principal owner, George Steinbrenner, rejected
it. But Monday, Giuliani said the older plan was ``much more
comprehensive'' than Ferrer's proposal, which he said included only
a ``sketchy'' cost estimate. Ferrer put the cost of his plan, which
combines elements of several previous stadium proposals, at $535
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I happen to know that this plan is a watered-down version and
a not very well thought-out version of a much more comprehensive
plan,'' Giuliani said at a Monday afternoon news conference on
Rikers Island. He added that the city was ready ``to do not only
the things indicated in Freddy Ferrer's press release, but many
more things that are a lot more comprehensive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saying that it's a warmed-over plan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner has threatened to move his team to New Jersey or
Manhattan for years, complaining that the Bronx stadium has too few
luxury boxes and parking spaces and that the neighborhood frightens
fans. The team's lease with the city expires in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner's wavering has created tension between city
politicians, with Giuliani pushing for a publicly financed stadium
on the West Side of Manhattan and the City Council Speaker Peter
Vallone, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate, pushing for a
referendum on that plan.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner is expected to announce later this fall where the
team will play after 2002.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ferrer said Monday that his plan, called Yankee Village, was
meant to bring the focus of the negotiations back to the Bronx. The
plan differs from previous ones, he said, because it proposes that
the city condemn the dilapidated Bronx Terminal Market, a 32-acre
site on the south side of the stadium, to build a waterfront park
along the Harlem River and 450,000 square feet of commercial space.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the first proposal to include conceptual drawings,
Ferrer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This plan substantively addresses every area of concern ever
addressed by the Yankees and neighborhood residents,'' Ferrer said
in an interview. ``The mayor has this unfortunate habit of
reflexively criticizing ideas that are not his own.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Steinbrenner would not comment on Ferrer's plan
Monday, saying that Steinbrenner was focusing on his team's
performance in the playoffs, which begin Tuesday night against the
Texas Rangers at Yankee Stadium. ``Until the season is over, he's
not going to comment on anything except baseball,'' said the
spokesman, Howard J. Rubenstein.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, who added fuel to the debate last week by
saying that the Yankees ``belong in the Bronx, period,'' also
declined to comment on Ferrer's proposal Monday, saying he needed
to study it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to take a look,'' said Michael McKeon, a spokesman
for Pataki. ``The governor wants the team to stay in New York, and
his clear preference is that they remain in the Bronx.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has also said that he wanted the Yankees to stay in the
Bronx, but that the city should offer alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor chided Ferrer for unveiling his proposal at a news
conference, saying he should have discussed it with city officials
and the Yankees first. But Ferrer said that he had copies delivered
to Giuliani and Steinbrenner early Monday, and that his main
priority was making it public. Ferrer was joined at his news
conference by Linda Ruth Tosetti, Babe Ruth's granddaughter, who
proclaimed the plan ``a fabulous idea'' as nine television cameras
rolled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole Ruth family was horrified, aghast, to learn that the
Yankees might be leaving the Bronx,'' Mrs. Tosetti said. ``I hope
Mr. Steinbrenner and the mayor listen.''
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani, who trades frequent barbs with Ferrer, said he
could not take seriously a proposal that reporters had seen before
he had.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever a politician takes their report and gives it to the
press first rather than the governmental agencies that would work
with it,'' Giuliani said, ``by and large the politician is looking
for some cheap publicity. I have to assume it's a press release and
not really a plan.''

HURRICANE GEORGES MOVES INLAND, LOSES SOME OF ITS PUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (UPDATES with new 5th graf, downgraded to tropical storm; Pickup
5th graf pvs, Forecasters, along ...)  
 (ATTN: La., Ala., Miss., Fla.)  (lh)

<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ From the eastern reaches of New Orleans to
Pensacola, Fla., Hurricane Georges pounded the Gulf Coast on Monday
with destructive winds and even more destructive rains, then slowly
began to lose some of its punch as it drifted inland.
</P>
<P>
   Battering the beaches, towns and cities of Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle with winds up to 100
miles an hour and more than a foot of rain, it left trees uprooted,
power lines down, roads washed out and hundreds of homes and
businesses badly knocked about or flooded.
</P>
<P>
   It spawned tornadoes, most of them harmless, though the winds of
one were clocked at 174 miles an hour as it spun past an airport.
The hurricane pounded a crippled ship and the tug that was towing
it so hard that Coast Guard officials worried both might founder.
And it was blamed for two deaths in New Orleans, one occurring when
an elderly woman suffered a heart attack while being evacuated from
her flooded home and the other occurring when a man set his
darkened house afire while trying to light it with a candle.
</P>
<P>
   The storm was also blamed for the death of a Pensacola woman who
was killed Sunday in a house fire. Authorities believe she was
lighting a candle because there was no power.
</P>
<P>
   By this afternoon the winds had dropped to 60 mph, and it was
downgraded to a tropical storm.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters, along with public safety officials, warned that
because the storm was so saturated with rain after a slow meander
across the tropical waters of the Gulf, and because it was moving
inland so slowly, the Gulf Coast and the rest of the Deep South
should be on the lookout for heavy flooding over the next several
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not quite out of the water yet,'' Police Chief Ben
Morris told the residents of Slidell, La., on the Mississippi
border, as they began to emerge from shelters and boarded up homes
to take up the task of cleaning up behind Georges.
</P>
<P>
   But despite all the misery and grief caused when Georges roared
ashore out of the Gulf before daybreak Monday morning, its eye
centered on Biloxi, Miss., the storm was not its old killer self.
</P>
<P>
   It could not sustain its 100-mile-an-hour-plus winds for long
once it began to drag over land, leading weather forecasters to
predict, cautiously, that it would probably blow itself out in the
next few days. Moreover, Gulf Coast residents, given plenty of
warning that Georges earlier had killed 300 people and left 100,000
more homeless down in the Caribbean, largely avoided its worst by
battening down ahead of time and fleeing, when they could, to
higher ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could have been a lot worse,'' Kenny Campo, a marina operator
said, as he surveyed his mostly unscathed place in low-lying St.
Bernard Parish, southeast of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Pensacola was awash in more than 20 inches of rain that fell
there in less than 24 hours. But for all that, flood damage was
relatively minor in most places.
</P>
<P>
   A few streets in downtown Mobile, Ala., were waist-deep in sea
water, and the causeway leading southeast out of town was hit by a
sea surge that swept away some stores and restaurants. Yet most of
the city's businesses and homes escaped.
</P>
<P>
   One Mobile resident, Sandra Pettway, was less traumatized by
Georges than the 8-foot alligator it drove up into the housing
project in which she lives with her three children. ``Some people
were shooting at him,'' she said. ``But I didn't have a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   In Biloxi, there was also flooding. But the town's main
attraction, its casinos, largely escaped serious damage _ though
not a loss of revenue from having to shut down for several days. A
few miles further west, in Gulfport, the wind blew so hard at one
point that it toppled over an 18-wheel tractor-trailer on
Interstate 10.
</P>
<P>
   But most houses and businesses escaped with only a scratch or
two. And in New Orleans, the place where Georges potentially could
have caused a huge catastrophe _ the city has the Gulf Coast's
largest concentration of people and lies 6 feet below sea level
behind its levees _ there was hardly any real damage except along
the shores of Lake Ponchartrain, where storm-driven waves smashed a
line of fishing shacks and cottages.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   By late afternoon, with Georges beginning to slowly drift off
toward the northeast and winds and rains letting up a bit, New
Orleanians, especially those hunkered down in makeshift shelters
like the Superdome, began to chafe for their freedom.
</P>
<P>
   A curfew was still in effect _ ``for your safety until we can
get things straightened out a bit,'' Mayor Marc Morial said _ but
with each passing hour it was ignored by more and more people. Down
in the old French Quarter, Chris LeBoeuf ventured forth and opened
his souvenir shop. And in no time customers were arriving,
especially tourists who had been trapped in their hotels for two
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come in, and they're just glad to have some place to go
for a change,'' LeBoeuf said. The police let it go.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the city's store owners, Frank Ordano, complained
that power company crews had not been fast enough getting power
restored. ''There's no bad weather here,'' he declared. ``Sunday
was a little bit rainy and wind, Monday even less so.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Mobile, by late in the day, the had-enough-of-all-this
story was much the same, though the wind there was still blowing up
to 60 miles an hour, and the rain was still coming down. Debbie
Stephens, hunkered down at home rather than in a shelter, said she
and her family were safe enough but the power was out and ``there's
just nothing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just about to die from boredom,'' she continued. ``There's
no power, no television, no stereo. You can't read. We've played
all the games. And now everybody's eating everything in sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Kirk Fordice of Mississippi said after an early look at the
damage in his state that while Mississippians had been lucky,
foresight also had played a major role in limiting loss. ``The
preparation for this emergency,'' he said, ``is much better than in
years past.''
</P>
<P>
   Weather forecasters predicted that because Georges began to lose
some of its punch as soon as it came ashore early Monday morning,
it probably would lose still more power overnight as it inched
further inland _ barring an unexpected resurgence of energy. By
Tuesday, they said, its maximum sustained winds should be well
below 75 miles an hour, the hurricane force threshold.

COMMENTARY: CONFESSIONS OF A FOUL-WEATHER METS FAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By TINA ROSENBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While the rest of the country has been consumed this
summer with the Mark McGwire-Sammy Sosa duel, the home run most
precious to me took place in Houston on Sept. 15. The hitter was
Mets shortstop Rey Ordonez, a fielding genius but no slugger. The
shot brought his home run total for the year to one, tying his
personal best, and that is where it stayed.
</P>
<P>
   I was not a Mets fanatic when the summer began. I acquired a
mild concern for the Mets' welfare a few years ago from my husband,
but by the end of this summer I was dragging him to watch games.
Until Monday morning, the first thing I would turn to in the
newspaper was the Mets box scores.
</P>
<P>
   Geography has usually determined my sports affections, but
geography has rarely handed me a winner. I spent much of the summer
of 1976 at Tiger Stadium, when the Tigers finished next to last. In
college I suffered with the famously hapless Chicago Cubs. During
my years at Northwestern, the football team went 2-52. But there
was perverse pleasure in games where we could embarrass the
competition just by getting a first down. And Northwestern's 1996
Rose Bowl victory was all the sweeter. Cheering for losers had its
charms.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are not Northwestern but a respectable team with two
World Series titles. Even in bad years they won in endearing
surprises, ninth-inning heart-stoppers in seasons when they went
further than their talent should have allowed.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, fans actually started expecting victory, and
it was crushing when it stopped coming. This is why the Mets' lone
superstar would be greeted by a standing ovation in the first
inning, and jeers in the fourth. Booing Mike Piazza was an act of
fan folly that could help drive away the best player the team has
seen in years. But Piazza's abilities made his strikeouts more
heartbreaking. The Mets ended up with exactly the same 88-74 record
as last year, but their trajectory seemed designed to torture fans.
They led us on until the season's end, and then pathetically
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   I will probably feel differently when the bruises fade, but at
the moment I'll take a bum team with some happy surprises over the
self-destructing Mets.  &QL;

FCC BLOCKS TWO BELLS ON LONG-DISTANCE ENTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are two basic sets of telecommunications regulations in
the United States: one that applies to the local Bell phone
companies, and another that applies to everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between them was apparent Monday as the Federal
Communications Commission ended attempts by two Bells, Ameritech
Corp. and US West Inc., to slip into the long-distance business
even as the two-week-old MCI Worldcom Inc. said it would combine
its local, long-distance and international networks in a plan to
cut rates for business customers.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the five Bells' heritage as part of AT&AMP;T Corp. and
because of their high degree of control over local phone systems,
they are not allowed to sell long-distance service. Just about any
other company that wants become a long-distance carrier is free to
do so.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Bells must stay
out of the long-distance business until they convince the FCC that
they have opened their local networks to competitors. No Bell has
yet passed that test.
</P>
<P>
   In May, however, US West and Ameritech tried to sidestep the
long-distance restriction by striking marketing deals with Qwest
Communications International Inc., a new long-distance company.
Under those deals, each Bell would have received fees for signing
up customers for Qwest's long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   Not many telecommunications experts expected the commission to
go along with that, but Ameritech and US West maintained that the
arrangement complied with the law because Qwest was not formally
affiliated with the Bells.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC proved the skeptics right Monday, ruling that the deals
violated the communications act.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were to allow an agreement like this to go forward, we
would in essence gut the incentives for the regional Bell companies
to open their markets,'' William E. Kennard, the commission's
chairman, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Ameritech, US West and Qwest declined to comment. As a non-Bell,
MCI Worldcom is allowed to offer any bundle of communications
services it pleases. Monday, the company announced a new service
called On-Net that it said could cut communications costs for
business customers by up to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the rationale for Worldcom's acquiring MCI was that the
combined company could meld its networks to create a seamless
system for global communications. As a long-distance carrier, MCI's
largest expense had been fees paid to local phone companies for
beginning and ending calls.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom now wants essentially to eliminate those fees for
business customers who use the company for both local and
long-distance calling. For a conversation or data message that
travels exclusively on MCI Worldcom's network, rates could decrease
by as much as 35 percent, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're calling from Frankfort, Ky., to Frankfurt, Germany,
that's treated like a local call,'' said Timothy F. Price, who runs
MCI Worldcom's domestic business.
</P>
<P>
   For business customers who use MCI Worldcom's network to call
people who employ other carriers, the reduction would be around 15
percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Price said his company would be able to offset the decreased
revenues by convincing customers to increase their overall use of
MCI Worldcom services. He refused to project the overall impact the
initiative would have on the company's revenues and earnings.

 &HT;    Here come the Cubs
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ It was just one playoff game, just one win, but in a
city that has endured so much losing from a team yet has never
turned its back, there was reason to party Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   So drink a toast to Harry Caray, bring out the bleacher bums and
don't dare trim the ivy _ the Cubs are headed to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In a fitting ending to a regular season of one surprise after
another, the Cubs, who have played in just 11 postseason games
since the end of World War II, outlasted the San Francisco Giants
5-3 in a playoff game at Wrigley Field that decided the National
League wild card entry.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago starter Steve Trachsel took a no-hitter into the seventh
inning before it was broken up with one out by Giants pinch-hitter
Brent Mayne. The Cubs got the hits when they needed them, made the
plays when they had to and made Wrigley one big dance hall when it
was all over.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago will open a best-of-five series Wednesday afternoon at
4:07 at Turner Field, facing a Braves team the Cubs beat in six of
nine games in the regular season. Still, the Cubs arrive as a huge
underdog, a team that before Monday had lost six of its last eight
games. Only that wasn't evident against the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   For four innings, neither team could score. Sammy Sosa, with 66
home runs and trailing Mark McGwire by four on a night where
anything deep would count among his regular-season statistics, hit
into a double play and struck out in his first two at-bats against
Giants right-hander Mark Gardner, who was almost matching Traschel.
</P>
<P>
   That all changed in the fifth. Gary Gaetti, who had hit seven
homers since being brought over from the Cardinals on Aug. 19, went
deep again, a two-run shot, and the Cubs had a 2-0 lead. They added
to it in the fifth when Henry Rodriguez brought home Lance Johnson
and Sosa with a bases-loaded single.
</P>
<P>
   Traschel got in trouble in the seventh, getting lifted for Matt
Karchner with runners at first and second and one out. Stan Javier
then sent a ball down the left field line that left fielder Orlando
Merced caught while diving into the stands. But pinch hitter Shawon
Dunston loaded the bases on a infield hit and up came Barry Bonds.
The Cubs went to their bullpen, going for left-hander Felix
Heredia, who got Bonds to ground out to first.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa helped the Cubs add to their lead in the eighth, reaching
on a one-out single, moving to third on a double by Mark Grace,
then scoring with two out on a wild pitch by Giants reliever Jose
Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's Kevin Tapani pitched a scoreless eighth but started
the ninth by allowing singles to Mayne and Bill Mueller. He was
relieved by Terry Mulholland, who had pitched eight innings the
previous day as the starter. Javier hit his first pitch for an RBI
single, then Ellis Burks walked to load the bases for Barry Bonds.
Bonds lined out to right for the first out, scoring a run, and the
Cubs turned to closer Rod Beck. Jeff Kent grounded out to second
for the second out. Former Toront Blue Jay Joe Carter, who homered
five years ago to win the World Series, flied out to Mark Grace for
the final out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs now must quickly turn their attention to the Braves.
They likely will start right-hander Mark Clark (9-14) in Game 1
against John Smoltz (17-3). Clark is 0-1 against Atlanta this
season.

MANY SCHOOLS NOT SET TO MEET NEW STANDARDS, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A science teacher predicts that if tough new state
standards are implemented, the weakest students will be ``thrown to
the wolves.'' A principal laments that ``many teachers can't
write,'' let alone teach challenging material. Another
administrator warns that immigrant students cannot be expected to
know, say, that George Washington was the first president of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   As high schools in New York City and throughout the state begin
phasing in new graduation standards this year, a report released
Monday by a New York City civic group paints a dour picture of the
current condition of education, especially in inner-city and rural
schools. It predicts that many schools are setting up children for
failure because the schools are not prepared to meet the new goals.
</P>
<P>
   The report, by the Community Service Society, a nonprofit group
dedicated to fighting poverty, argues that the new standards, while
laudable, are being imposed willy-nilly and without enough money to
back them up. It estimates that a huge infusion of cash _ $1.5
billion in New York City alone _ is needed to put the standards in
place.
</P>
<P>
   Among the obstacles that must be overcome, it says, are
untrained teachers; overcrowded classes; students who need remedial
work; immigrant students who are not familiar with American
history, literature and language; bilingual teachers who are not
proficient in English, and the lack of basic equipment like science
laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   ``If large numbers of inner-city and rural kids can't meet these
benchmarks, it means they have no place to go in the economy
whatsoever,'' David Jones, president of the society, said Monday.
``You literally could take what's a great idea and turn it into a
real negative for the state's kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new standards _ imposed by the state Board of Regents
and the state education commissioner, Richard Mills _ this year's
class of 11th-graders must pass an English Regents exam before
graduating in the year 2000. The current class of sixth graders
will have to pass all five Regents exams _ in English, math, U.S.
history and government, global studies and science _ with a score
of at least 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In between, the exams will be phased in one at a time. Until
now, students could take a much easier Regents Competency Exam to
graduate, and often only the best students at the best schools
would even attempt the Regents.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with principals and department heads from 18 schools
found many struggling just to keep up with current requirements.
``The state is just crazy,'' says one administrator, who like all
those quoted by the report is not named. ``They really need 10
years to do this.'' Another predicts that ``more and more students
will have to work on their own, because we simply don't have the
time,'' adding that the weakest students will sink to the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Still another says that no amount of training will be enough for
some teachers, who he said are almost impossible to get rid of,
adding, ``I do have some teachers who I'd prefer not to teach
Regents classes.''
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, the report estimates that the cost of putting the new
Regents standards in place will range from $2.7 billion to $3.5
billion, with more than half for new facilities. The state's own
estimate is much lower, at $66 million to $72 million for all
schools in the state, Natriello said.
</P>
<P>
   An Education Department spokesman, Bill Hershen, said: ``There's
no agreed-upon price. This is evolving over a year-by-year basis.''

DR. JOHN F. PRUDDEN, 78, SURGEON AND MEDICAL RESEARCHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Mass., Colo., Conn., Va., Texas)  (lh) 
 By FORD BURKHART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. John F. Prudden, a surgeon and researcher who used medicines
made from the cartilage of sharks, reptiles and bovine animals as
well as the chitin of lobster or shrimp shells to help heal wounds
and treat a range of diseases, died Sept. 12 at Northern
Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. He was 78 and lived in
Waccabuc, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was acute leukemia, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   As a professor of surgery at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical
Center in Manhattan in the 1950s, Prudden used bovine cartilage to
speed the healing of open wounds like bedsores _ known as decubitus
ulcers _ which can result from poor circulation or immobilization.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he found that bovine cartilage contained a protein that
inhibited the growth of blood vessels that tumors depended upon for
nourishment. Thus, he believed, the cartilage could be used to
starve a cancerous tumor by suppressing its blood supply. He also
found that use of bovine cartilage increased the number of natural
killer cells, like T-cells, and other cells that could block
replication of cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Prudden founded Lescarden Inc., a biotechnology
company, and was its chief executive officer for 22 years.
Lescarden developed products with bovine cartilage to treat
diseases like psoriasis and arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Prudden also reported research that used cartilage treatment to
help osteoarthritis patients, and he believed that it could be used
to treat cancer and other diseases that depend on the development
of new blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   He received the Linus Pauling Scientist of the Year award in
1995 from the Cancer Treatment Research Foundation for his decades
of work with bovine cartilage applications.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Fostoria, Ohio, and received his B.A. from
Harvard College in 1942, his M.D. from Harvard Medical School in
1945 and his doctorate in medical science, specializing in
biochemistry, from Columbia University in 1950. During the Korean
War, he was a captain in the Army Medical Corps and was chief of
the laboratory division and physiology section of the surgical
research unit at Fort Sam Houston, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife of 44 years, Carla; three daughters,
Pamela Clark of Greenwich, Conn., Elaine Rodriguez of Fort Monroe,
Va., and Sarah Prudden of Bloomingburg, N.Y.; three sons, Dr.
Peter, of Fort Collins, Colo., John Jr., of Chappaqua, N.Y., and
James, of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., and six grandchildren.

A LOOK AT THE MLS PLAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MetroStars (15-17) vs. Columbus (15-17): This is the closest
matchup of the four series in the MLS playoffs, which will start
Wednesday and end with the championship game on Oct. 25 in the Rose
Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. Along with identical records, the teams
had awful finishes in the regular season going into the
two-of-three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   But the MetroStars may have the edge: Columbus finished with
five straight losses, while the MetroStars hired Bora Milutinovic
as coach last week and he seemed to put things in order almost
immediately. The MetroStars ended a six-game losing streak with a
shootout victory in New England in their final regular-season game.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus and the MetroStars split their season series, each
winning twice at home. Both have a key player whose status is
questionable because of injury: Eduardo Hurtado of the MetroStars
with a broken nose and Brian Maisonneuve of the Crew with a
sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   When they were taken into a shootout by New England, the
MetroStars were missing Hurtado, Marcelo Vega and Diego Sonora;
they will be a better team with those three. More important, they
showed discipline with Milutinovic as coach and they allowed New
England few chances.
</P>
<P>
   D.C. United (24-8) vs. Miami (15-17): The teams tied in their
season series, 2-2, but Miami won the last two games against the
two-time defending champions. Diego Serna, who has done wonders for
Miami since moving from midfield to attack, has four goals and two
assists in the two victories and is the biggest threat for Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Serna, however, is the Fusion's only threat, while United has
several productive scorers, starting with Roy Lassiter, Jaime
Moreno and Marco Etcheverry. Miami's defense is also suspect, while
United's defense includes Eddie Pope, Jeff Agoos and Carlos
Liamosa.
</P>
<P>
   United had some misfortune in Sunday's regular-season finale
against Columbus. The 3-2 shootout victory over Columbus cost
United dearly, as Moreno and Tony Sanneh suffered injuries that may
keep them out of Wednesday's first game. Sanneh underwent abdominal
and groin surgery in June that forced him to miss several games.
</P>
<P>
   Miami, which clinched a playoff berth a week ago, dropped a 3-1
decision to Tampa Bay on Sunday in a game in which the Fusion
rested six starters, including Serna and the starting goalkeeper
Jeff Cassar.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles (24-8) vs. Dallas (15-17): Although Los Angeles won
three of the four meetings between the teams this season (including
a league-record 8-1 victory), Dallas swept the Galaxy in last
season's playoffs and did not allow a goal. But the Galaxy was the
highest-scoring team in the league this season (85 goals), while
the Burn had the fewest goals (43).
</P>
<P>
   Cobi Jones (19 goals), Welton (17) and Mauricio Cienfuegos (13)
have scored more goals (49) than the entire Dallas team. But the
Galaxy has had its difficulties scoring lately, with only one goal
in its last three games.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago (20-12) vs. Colorado (16-16): Chicago won the season
series, 3-1, outscoring the Rapids by 14-5. The Fire dominated both
games at Soldier Field, but the games in Denver were close.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago was plagued by injuries the last two months, but all of
its players are at almost 100 percent for the playoffs. It also has
more depth, allowing coach Bob Bradley to make changes late in the
game when things don't go Chicago's way.

HELEN WINTHROP EDEY, 86, PHILANTHROPIST AND PSYCHIATRIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Mass., Md.)  (lh) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Helen Winthrop Edey, a philanthropist and psychiatrist who
was active in the field of women's reproductive health and rights,
died Sept. 15 at the Martha's Vineyard Hospital in Massachusetts.
She was 86 and lived on Martha's Vineyard and in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edey was the former Helen W. Kellogg, a daughter of Morris
W. Kellogg, an industrialist who founded Kellogg Co., a New
Jersey-based manufacturer of oil industry equipment. The
beneficiaries of her philanthropy included organizations trying to
control population growth and to give women the right to choose the
number of children they have. She also supported environmental
causes and nuclear arms control.
</P>
<P>
   She was a former chairman and a longtime treasurer of the
Association for Voluntary Surgical Contraception, which has become
AVSC International. (The term surgical contraception refers to
methods of sterilization like vasectomy for men and tubal ligation
for women.) The association is based in New York and works in the
United States and more than 40 other countries to provide training
and other support to health care professionals in the fields of
family planning and reproductive health.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Allan Rosenfield, dean of the Joseph L. Mailman School of
Public Health of Columbia University, said, ``Dr. Edey became a
psychiatrist after her four children were born and had a remarkable
professional career, both as a psychiatrist and as an individual
who was very much concerned about women's reproductive health and
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edey did much fund-raising on behalf of AVSC International.
Working through the association and on her own, she also played a
role in persuading a growing number of health care institutions in
the United States to provide voluntary surgical contraception.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edey was long active in, and on the boards of, the Scherman
Foundation, which works in various fields; the Edey Foundation, set
up by her husband, Maitland A. Edey, an editor at Time Inc. and an
author, which supports conservation activities on Martha's
Vineyard, and the Martha's Vineyard Community Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   A native New Yorker, she graduated from Brearley School in New
York City and in 1933 from Vassar. She received her medical degree
in 1951 from New York University, graduated in 1962 from the
William Alanson White Psychoanalytic Institute in Manhattan and
practiced psychiatry and psychoanalysis from 1957 to 1970 in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, the co-author of the book ``Lucy: The Beginnings of
Mankind'' (1981), which won a National Book Award, died in 1992.
Dr. Edey is survived by two sons, Maitland A. Jr. of Martha's
Vineyard and Winthrop of New York City; two daughters, Beatrice
Phear of Cambridge, Mass., and Marion Edey of Silver Spring, Md.;
13 grandchildren, and 4 great-grandchildren.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hurricane Georges wiped out the UCLA-Miami game.
Now the U.S. court system has delayed discussions about
rescheduling it.
</P>
<P>
   Miami athletic director Paul Dee was on jury duty Monday and
couldn't be reached by UCLA officials to determine if the schools
will play Dec. 5 in the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Bruins seemingly have few tangible reasons to
play: The cancellation is unlikely to affect their Rose Bowl or
Fiesta Bowl status, and the lost revenue ($700,000) is more than
offset by the $19 million Adidas contract which takes effect in
July.
</P>
<P>
   More, CBS has not indicated whether it will broadcast a Dec. 5
matchup. The network is scheduled to show Army-Navy and a college
basketball game that day.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' greatest incentive is the competition, and a chance
to play in the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   At his weekly press conference, UCLA coach Bob Toledo expressed
several concerns about rescheduling:
</P>
<P>
   __ Playing two weeks after the Nov. 21 season finale against
USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you can well imagine, our players and alumni ... don't like
anything post-USC,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans play Notre Dame after UCLA, albeit one week after
the cross-town showdown, not two.
</P>
<P>
   __ Extending the season by two weeks. A Dec. 5 game means the
Bruins would practice from Aug. 21 through a possible bowl game,
with only five days off during exams.
</P>
<P>
   __ It could disrupt the recruiting season. UCLA usually
schedules 10 to 15 on-campus visits the first weekend in December.
</P>
<P>
   __ The team banquet is scheduled for Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   __ Many players had planned to visit their families on
Thanksgiving weekend (Nov. 26-29) and would have to cancel if the
game is rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think about those things,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the players would vote on rescheduling, Toledo said:
``I think they'd have mixed emotions....
</P>
<P>
   ``They've talked in general terms, but nothing has been decided.
We all like to play the games, but at that late date, I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Great, just great: Washington State coach Mike Price was
headed to practice Thursday afternoon when he heard about the
UCLA-Miami cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `OK, that's great.' It'll break their momentum.
This way, they'll have too many players healthy and not know who to
start,'' said Price, whose team visits the Rose Bowl on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury update:!off! Starting left guard Oscar Cabrera is
expected back this week after missing the Houston game with a
sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Starting defensive end Pete Holland and backup nose guard Ken
Kocher will test their sprained ankles this week. For now, they're
questionable.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: The Bruins climbed one spot, to fourth, in the
coaches' poll. They fell one spot, to fourth, in the writers'
poll.... A crowd of 65,000 is expected for Washington State.
Kickoff is 12:30 p.m. Call 310-UCLA-WIN for info.... No
determination yet on a kickoff time for the Arizona game Oct. 10.
ABC will announce next week if the Bruins-Wildcats will play at
12:30 p.m. or 7:15 p.m.

LAMAR CROWSON, 72, PIANIST FOR CHAMBER MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lamar Crowson, an American pianist who, though little known in
the United States, was regarded by many colleagues as one of the
finest chamber musicians of his time, died on Aug. 25 in
Johannesburg, South Africa, where he lived. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Crowson played with outstanding contemporaries. Alfred Brendel
recalled hearing him in partnership with the cellist Jacqueline du
Pre, and expressed surprise that a virtuoso of his caliber devoted
himself to chamber music. Crowson's own words provide an answer,
for he occasionally confessed to finding solo work ``bare and
lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   He was born May 27, 1926, in Tampa, Fla., and received his early
education in Portland, Ore. He went on to study at the Royal
College of Music in London, where he joined the faculty in 1957.
Meanwhile he had begun his performing career. His repertory as a
soloist was wide _ from the sonatas of Haydn and Mozart through big
Romantic concertos to new music _ but he quickly came to
concentrate on chamber music.
</P>
<P>
   With the Melos Ensemble of London he made recordings of the
Mozart and Beethoven Quintets for piano and wind, Hummel's Quintet
and Septet, Schubert's ``Trout'' Quintet and Janacek's Concertino.
His flawless rhythmic drive, always intense and compelling, is
equally apparent in his recording of the Faure Piano Quartet with
the Pro Arte.
</P>
<P>
   Crowson settled in South Africa in 1972, teaching at the
University of Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by the sons of his first marriage, John and Paul;
by his third wife, Estelle, and by her sons, Hans and Andries
Beyers.
